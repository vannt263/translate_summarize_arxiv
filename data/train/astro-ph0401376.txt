    "theoretical ideas about the first , metal - free stars have developed rapidly in recent years , despite the absence of direct observational evidence of their properties . as a specific prediction of the big bang theory ,",
    "metal - free first stars confront both cosmology and astrophysics generally with important questions : when did the first stars form ? what was their initial mass function ( imf ) ?",
    "what were their lifetimes and feedback effects ?",
    "where are their remnants ( compact objects and/or metal enrichment ) ? the standard tools of stellar evolution theory have been applied to calculate the evolving structure and radiative spectra of metal - free stars , given their mass ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ; marigo et al .",
    "2000 ; bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ; tumlinson , shull , & venkatesan 2003 , hereafter tsv03 ) .",
    "many uncertainties remain about the cosmological context and feedback effects of the first stars , the largest of which concern the duration of the metal - free phase and the imf . despite these unknowns , theoretical progress on the first stars",
    "has arrived at six points of consensus :    * the first stars form from metal - free gas in the first collapsed dark matter halos around @xmath7 ( ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002a , b ) .",
    "* the first stars may be very massive ( @xmath12  @xmath1 ) , because they are restricted during their formation to inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen below @xmath13 k ( abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ) . *",
    "these very massive first stars seed their own halos and possibly enrich nearby ones by releasing metals from pair - instability supernovae ( 140  260  @xmath1 ; heger & woosley 2002 , hereafter hw02 ) .",
    "* at critical metallicity @xmath14 , protostellar clouds are able to cool and fragment more efficiently , leading to a `` normal '' imf ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; schneider et al .",
    "where this metallicity has not been reached , the imf retains its unusual properties .",
    "halo and igm enrichment probably occur inhomogeneously in time and space during the transition to `` normal '' star formation . *",
    "the first stars begin , and may complete the reionization of intergalactic h  i ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) and he  ii ( venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 , hereafter vts03 ) . the total first - stars contribution to the global ionizing photon budget is unknown , but the efficient ionization of vms is thought to be required",
    ". there may be partial recombination during the transition phase in metallicity , followed by a second reionization near @xmath15 ( cen 2003a ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; vts03 ) . *",
    "the first - stars epoch ends when all star forming regions have achieved the critical metallicity .",
    "this is thought to occur before the final stages of h  i reionization at @xmath16 .",
    "this consensus is not universally accepted in all details , but it serves as a working hypothesis in the literature .",
    "point ( 2 ) , the _ vms hypothesis _ , has appeared often in studies of the first stars concerned with their cosmic origins , their sites of formation , and their importance for reionization . in this paper",
    ", we examine this hypothesis with the objective of constructing an imf for the first stars that is consistent with current observational constraints .",
    "we meet this goal by examining the arguments for the vms hypothesis and by investigating how its key lines of evidence can also support an imf without vms .",
    "our critique of the vms hypothesis addresses consensus points ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) particularly .",
    "the empirical basis of point ( 3 ) is the work of oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and qian & wasserburg ( 2002 ) , who argued that the relative metal abundances in extremely metal - poor ( emp ) halo stars match the expected signatures from vms ( hw02 ) .",
    "their conclusion has since been adopted as positive evidence of vms metal - enrichment and ionizing photon production in the first stellar generation .",
    "we argue that this line of evidence is not supported by the broader sets of abundance data presently available .",
    "instead , we adopt the view of umeda & nomoto ( 2004 , hereafter un04 ) that these observed abundances are better matched by core - collapse supernovae or `` hypernovae '' from 10  50  @xmath1  progenitors .",
    "we then examine point ( 5 ) in light of evolving spectra models for metal - free stars ( tsv03 ) and recent studies of star formation at zero metallicity .",
    "vms have been suggested as the most viable cause of the high thomson electron - scattering optical depth @xmath17 derived from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . instead",
    ", we find that reionization models incorporating an imf that excludes both low - mass stars and vms can meet the reionization constraint .",
    "the lower but equally uncertain value @xmath18 found by joint analysis of _ wmap _ and the sdss matter power spectrum by tegmark et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is reproduced by our models , but since it is also easier to accommodate to a standard imf we conclude that the optical depth to reionization is not a decisive constraint on the imf at early times . because the ionizing efficiency of metal - free stars increases more rapidly from 1  50  @xmath1  than it does above this range ( see   4 ) , we are able to construct an imf with ionizing properties similar to those of vms .",
    "we conclude , on the basis of these results , that vms are not necessary to meet the existing constraints commonly taken to motivate them .",
    "we also do not need to invoke high values for the escape fraction of ionizing radiation or the star formation efficiency in halos ( cf .",
    ", oh et al . 2001 ; somerville , bullock & livio 2003 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , in   2 , we review the theoretical motivation for vms in the first stellar generation and distinguish two versions of the vms hypothesis . in   3 we review the extremely metal - poor halo star abundances and compare specific patterns in the nucleosynthetic evidence to theoretical yields . in ",
    "4 we use our results to motivate a range of possible first - stars imfs and derive a timescale for the epoch of metal - free star formation . in   5 we discuss semi - analytic reionization models that compare these different imfs to vms . in   6 we draw general conclusions and discuss some unsolved problems in the study of the first stars .",
    "we define vms to include stars with @xmath19  @xmath1 , the lowest mass at which metal - free stars explode as pair - instability supernovae ( pisn ; hw02 ) .",
    "this is the only clear mass cutoff higher than the uncertain @xmath20  @xmath1  division between core - collapse sn and complete collapse to black holes ( hw02 ) .",
    "the @xmath19  @xmath1  definition cleanly separates two mass regimes with very different nucleosynthetic signatures ( see   3 ) but similar radiative properties .",
    "the mass cutoff is rigid for the purposes of definition only ; it may be more loosely defined in reality without interfering with our conclusions , provided it marks a qualitative change in the nucleosynthetic signature of the stars .",
    "the theoretical motivation for the vms hypothesis rests primarily on the microscopic processes of radiative cooling in low - density primordial gas . at @xmath21  k , cooling by h and he is negligible and metal - line cooling is dominated by [ c  ii ] , [ o  i ] , and [ si ii ] fine - structure lines . because metal - free gas is restricted to relatively inefficient cooling by h@xmath22 at @xmath21  k , cooling rates are reduced , and the balance between pressure support and gravitational collapse is shifted to higher temperatures . primordial protostellar objects , being unable to cool or fragment , must therefore be more massive to overcome their elevated gas pressure",
    ". the final star should also be more massive if all the cloud can accrete .",
    "this simple physical description was rigorously implemented by abel , bryan , & norman ( 2000 ) , who used an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code to follow the evolution of metal - free gas from cosmological initial conditions down to the formation of a self - gravitating object with @xmath23  @xmath1 .",
    "the simulation was halted when the core became optically thick to 2  line emission , which occurred before the object was completely formed .",
    "this study implies vms with @xmath0  @xmath1 , if all the gravitationally bound gas can accrete to a single star .",
    "recent studies ( omukai & palla 2002 ; tan & mckee 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ) , taking the abel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) result as a starting point for semi - analytic models of primordial star formation , indicate that reality is complicated by stellar feedback on the accreting matter .",
    "omukai & palla ( 2002 ) identified a critical accretion rate ( @xmath24 @xmath25  @xmath1  yr@xmath26 ) below which laminar accretion onto a spherically - symmetric protostar can proceed to @xmath12  @xmath1unimpeded by feedback . above this critical rate , the accretion luminosity exceeds the eddington limit and the flow is reversed at 100  300  @xmath1 .",
    "models by bromm & loeb ( 2004 ) have found a conservative upper limit of 500 @xmath1 , by setting the time available to accretion to be the stellar lifetime ( @xmath27 yr ) but ignoring feedback . tan & mckee ( 2002 ) consider the effects of disk accretion geometry , rotation , and radiation feedback in limiting the mass of primordial stars .",
    "they find that these feedback mechanisms are likely to operate at @xmath28  @xmath1 , perhaps limiting the masses of metal - free stars to this range .",
    "however , they later found ( tan & mckee 2004 ) that none of the feedback mechanisms considered can halt the accretion before the star achieves @xmath29 @xmath1 .",
    "this important result indicates that both vms and low - mass stars may not form at zero metallicity and suggests that the mass limits of the primordial imf may be quite different from today . in   4 we use this idea and empirical constraints to construct an imf for the first stars .",
    "these theoretical studies of primordial protogalaxies and star formation posit that the first generation of stars was partially , and perhaps completely , composed of vms . to capture existing evidential claims ,",
    "we introduce a distinction between the _ strong _ vms hypothesis ( `` the first generation were exclusively vms '' ) and the _ weak _ vms hypothesis ( `` the first generation included vms in addition to @xmath30  @xmath1  stars '' ) .",
    "both versions appear in the literature , although not with these names .",
    "the evidence can bear differently on the two versions of the hypothesis , because the ionizing properties and nucleosynthetic yields vary across the mass function .",
    "these labels do not connote the relative merit of the two versions ; they suggest only that the `` strong '' hypothesis is more readily falsified than the `` weak '' .",
    "the `` weak '' hypothesis is expected to be more difficult to constrain , because it includes low - mass stars and so is more like the present - day circumstances .",
    "we evaluate these versions of the hypothesis below .",
    "the hw02 stellar evolution and supernova models show that , between 140  260  @xmath1 , zero - metallicity stars are highly susceptible to the pair - production instability after core he depletion .",
    "this instability quickly disrupts the star , ejects metals , and leaves no compact remnant .",
    "because it is triggered at an unusually early period in the star s evolution , this pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) produces an unusual nucleosynthetic signature .",
    "if the vms hypothesis is correct , the signature of pisn could appear in the metal abundances of `` second - generation '' emps in the galactic halo ( see   3 ) .",
    "qian & wasserburg ( 2002 ) and oh et al . ( 2001 ) used this idea to argue that these stars justify the vms hypothesis .",
    "models with vms have also been proposed to explain the current data on igm reionization , specifically the high electron - scattering optical depth @xmath2 found in the _ wmap _ cmb data . for the simplest possible reionization history ( a step function at fixed @xmath31 ) , this result implies that complete reionization occurred at @xmath32 ( spergel et al .",

    "wmap _ data will allow auto - correlation of the polarized cmb maps and should provide a direct and more precise determination of @xmath35 .",
    "when joined with spectroscopic observations that indicate a rapidly rising h  i gunn - peterson opacity up to @xmath36  6.4 ( becker et al . 2001 ; djorgovski et al . 2001 ) , the _ wmap _ result implies that the igm experienced a relatively complex ionization history , with extended periods of ionization in h  i and/or he  ii at @xmath36 6  20 ( vts03 ; cen 2003a ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ) . in a study of the ionizing properties of vms , bromm , kudritzki , & loeb ( 2001 ) found vms with @xmath37  @xmath1  to be an order of magnitude more efficient , _ on the zero - age main sequence _",
    ", at generating ionizing photons per unit stellar mass than are stars in a normal imf with @xmath38  @xmath1(tumlinson & shull 2000 ) .",
    "vms produce efficient ionization and have short lifetimes , and they are thought to form in the metal - free gas of collapsed halos at high @xmath39 . in light of these features , scenarios involving vms in combination with subsequent stellar populations have been widely proposed as an attractive explanation for the observed ionization and thermal history of the igm ( hui & haiman 2003 ) and the large detected @xmath2 to the cmb ( cen 2003b ; haiman & holder 2003 ; fukugita & kawasaki 2003 ; ciardi , ferrara & white 2003 ; kaplinghat et al .",

    "these `` nucleosynthesis '' and `` reionization '' lines of evidence are often taken to support the vms hypothesis . but are vms required ? are there other viable models for the emp metal abundances and reionization that do not include vms ?",
    "we argue that neither line of evidence is compelling .",
    "we take up the nucleosynthesis arguments first .",
    "many studies of reionization by the first stars (   2 ) have adopted the vms hypothesis , citing as evidence the apparent match between pisn yields and the metal abundances of emp halo stars ( oh et al .",

    "the review by mcwilliam ( 1997 ) gives a survey up to that time , and papers that cite it ( available from the astrophysical data service ) provide useful entry points to the more recent literature .",
    "we focus here on three clear features in galactic halo emp abundances which are confirmed by multiple studies and which bear directly on the vms hypothesis .",
    "these are the specific fe - peak element ratios ( especially zn ) , the widespread presence of @xmath4-process elements , and elevated [ c , n , o / fe ] ratios .",

    "we describe the nucleosynthetic evidence for vms as stated in the literature .",
    "observational studies of emp metal abundances have regarded the trends in the fe - peak and @xmath4-process  elements as the most critical constraints on the nature of the first stars .",
    "we examine the model of wasserburg & qian ( 2000 ) and qian & wasserburg ( 2002 ) , which represents only one example from a broad class of possible models that could explain the observed variations .",
    "we can not address all the possible variations in such a class , so we use this one because it admits vms objects as a possible source of early enrichment .",
    "we later use the phenomenological model of fields , truran , & cowan ( 2002 ) to illustrate why a successful model for the observed trends in @xmath4-process  abundances has difficulty incorporating vms .",
    "wasserburg & qian ( 2000 ; hereafter wq00 ) examined the behavior of [ @xmath4/fe]with [ fe / h ]  in the mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) sample and argued that the qualitative change in [ @xmath4/fe ]  at [ fe / h ]  @xmath44 presented an `` iron conundrum '' ; namely , that the wide dispersion in eu and ba abundances at [ fe / h ]  @xmath40 suggested unrelated sources of fe and @xmath4 elements . in response , they proposed a `` prompt '' ( p ) inventory of fe production by an initial population with large fe yields but little or no @xmath4 production .",
    "this initial inventory ceased at [ fe / h ]  @xmath45 , where the onset of high - frequency ( hf ) events ( sn ii ; @xmath46 yr ) and low - frequency ( lf ) events ( sn ia ; @xmath47 ) initiated a correlation between @xmath4 and fe . in this model ,",
    "the wide variation in fe for small barium abundance @xmath48(ba ) is attributed to diverse fe yields for p events or to multiple p progenitors .",
    "the low @xmath48(ba ) at [ fe / h ]  @xmath44 is attributed to small co - production of @xmath4 elements by p events or to dilution of a modest hf contribution .",
    "wq00 made no specific claims about the mass or metallicity of the p inventory sources .",
    "after establishing the general properties of the p inventory in wq00 , qian & wasserburg ( 2001 ) and qian & wasserburg ( 2002 ; hereafter qw02 ) noted that vms of a few hundred  @xmath1  possess the fe - rich , @xmath4-poor yields and short lifetimes ( @xmath49 myr ) necessary to produce the p inventory fe over the short time ( @xmath50 yr ) before the onset of hf events .",
    "this vms model readily accommodates the qualitative change in observed abundances at [ fe / h ]  @xmath51 , near the @xmath52 threshold where metal - line cooling is expected to change the imf ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "this model was extended by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to link the vms hypothesis to reionization .",
    "they pointed out that the trends in [ fe / h ]  and ba also appear in si and ca , elements produced by pisn , but not in c , which is not abundantly produced by pisn .",
    "their conclusion has since been adopted as positive evidence that vms dominated metal enrichment from the first stellar generation . on this assumption , oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argued that the fe enrichment in the p inventory ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 ) implies cumulative cosmic star formation activity sufficient to reionize the universe if all star formation is in vms .",
    "this result forms the empirical basis of the contention that vms could explain both the observed emp metal abundances and reionization together ( see points 3 and 5 in the introduction ) .",
    "however , closer scrutiny shows that the p inventory does not match all the observations .",
    "the p - inventory model is incompatible with the strong vms hypothesis , because vms have no significant post - he nuclear burning and therefore produce no @xmath4 elements ( hw02 ) .",
    "if vms produce all the fe up to [ fe / h ] @xmath43 , the @xmath4 elements should be absent instead of appearing at [ @xmath4/fe ] @xmath54 as observed .",
    "progenitors with @xmath55  @xmath1  are needed in the first generation to provide the observed @xmath4-process  elements ( truran et al .",
    "2002 ) , provided that the @xmath4-process  mechanisms that operate at finite metallicity can be safely extended to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the strong vms hypothesis is convincingly excluded , and the weak hypothesis is more naturally accommodated by the p - inventory model .",
    "the p - inventory model also provides a means for testing the weak vms hypothesis , because it attributes virtually all the fe to vms . to see why",
    ", we follow wq00 and estimate the fraction of fe in the p inventory that could be attributed to hf events .",
    "if we take the lowest @xmath48(ba ) to represent the contribution of a single hf event , then 40 such events contribute to the scatter in @xmath48(ba ) at [ fe / h ]  @xmath57 for a modest increase in [ fe / h ] .",
    "this small gain in fe enrichment limits the hf contribution to the p inventory to @xmath58% .",
    "another approach to this proof comes from consideration of a model imf .",
    "if we assume a salpeter imf with @xmath59  @xmath1 , adopt hw02 yields for vms and a uniform fe yield per star , @xmath60  @xmath1  for @xmath61 @xmath1 , we find that the vms mass range produces @xmath8 2/3 of the total fe yield over time ( more if the imf slope or mass limits are changed to favor high masses ) .",
    "thus , any element x with mass yield from vms similar to fe should appear with the appropriate ratio [ x / fe ] in the p inventory .    in the top panel of figure 1",
    "we compare the pisn yields ( hw02 ) to the emp metal abundances from three sources ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; carretta et al .",
    "2000 ; cayrel et al .",
    "we plot these samples separately and mark the theoretical pisn yields for three progenitor mass ranges with filled boxes .",
    "yields for unobserved elements are included for completeness and marked with lighter colors .",
    "we see that the observed abundances are consistent across the different studies for elements they have in common .",
    "clearly the high - mass pisn match well with si , ca ( as pointed out by oh et al .",
    "2001 ) , and to some extent with mn , but they are a poor match to the other elements .",
    "they overpredict cr , underpredict v , co , and produce little zn . the vms models are a poor fit to the data , especially for the fe - peak elements co and zn .",
    "the separation by mass range emphasizes that enrichment by one or a few stars is a much poorer fit to the observed data than a mass - weighted ( imf - averaged ) yield .",
    "some elements are matched best by the lower mass range , while others favor the higher masses ( which have fe yields of up to 40  @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , the data appear to be inconsistent with a model , such as the p inventory , in which these metal - poor stars formed from gas that was enriched only once or a few times by vms precursors .",
    "the generally poor match of pisn yields leads us to conclude that vms were probably not the precursors of these emps .",
    "the phenomenological model for @xmath4-process patterns by fields , truran , & cowan ( 2002 ) does not make specific reference to vms , but it is a good example of another class of models that can test the vms hypothesis .",
    "this study explains the @xmath8 2 dex scatter in [ @xmath4/fe ]  by a stochastic treatment of supernova enrichment that defines two types of sn with identical fe mass yield but very different [ @xmath4/fe ]  ( class a , high [ @xmath4/fe ] ; class b , low or zero [ @xmath4/fe ] ) .",
    "their artificial halo star sample reproduces the observed scatter in [ eu / fe ] below [ fe / h ]  @xmath62 when a events comprise @xmath63 5% of all sn . in this model ,",

    "furthermore , because the existing models with plausibly constructed imfs in the `` weak '' vms formulation must attribute all the early fe to vms , they also fail to match the observed abundance patterns of emp stars .",

    ", the lower panel of figure 1 shows the hn models compared to the three emp surveys .",
    "we display the hn yields for the fe - peak elements cr , mn , co , and zn resulting from explosions with @xmath73  @xmath1  and @xmath74 ( un04 ) .",
    "these elements are insensitive to the location of the mass cut in the supernova explosion , but they can vary with the electron mass fraction ( @xmath75 ) in the ejected material , the effects of which we include in the plotted range to show the improved fit ( e.g. , figure 4 of umeda & nomoto 2004 ) .",
    "the large explosion energies of hypernovae are needed to reproduce the observed zn . for all other elements ,",
    "we plot the yields of umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) , with @xmath76  @xmath1 , @xmath77 , and including mixing and fallback of the ejected material .",
    "while the hypernova phenomenon is gaining support from gamma - ray burst observations and theory , the hn explosion energy is still a free parameter in the umeda & nomoto ( 2004 ) models , and it is somewhat degenerate with stellar mass as a determining factor of the metal yields .",
    "there is also uncertainty associated with extrapolation from the low-@xmath39 , roughly solar - metallicity conditions to @xmath78 .",
    "although the apparent match of hn to the emp metal abundances is encouraging , they can not yet be conclusively identified as the products of the first stars .",

    "these abundances are not well - fitted by the yields of pair - instability supernovae from vms .",
    "this is not a refutation of the weak vms hypothesis , because it does not constitute evidence that vms were not present at some level .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "much depends on the true nature of the galactic halo emp stars .",
    "if they do not , in fact , trace the enrichment of the first stellar generation , then we will be left with few , if any , such tracers and none that indicate vms .",
    "for example , damped ly@xmath82 systems ( dlas ) in qso spectra are often considered to be candidates for studies of primordial nucleosynthesis , because they have low metallicity and , at high @xmath39 , they may reflect early chemical enrichment .",
    "however , the existing literature on dlas ( prochaska & wolfe 2002 and references therein ) shows that they generally have [ fe / h ]  @xmath83 , while the galactic halo emps range down to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , they may not reflect the same primordial metal enrichment thought to be seen in the emps with [ fe / h ]  @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the selective depletion of fe and other refractory elements onto dust grains in dlas can change the fe - peak abundance ratios in the gas and thus complicate comparisons to theoretical yields and other observations .",
    "finally , direct ratios between zn , cr , and mn in dlas match the emp stars that also have [ fe / h]@xmath86 , above the metallicity where the qualitatively distinct behavior of emps appears . while galactic stars and dlas in this higher metallicity regime may derive their metals from similar sources , and may in fact have unusual features , dlas by themselves do not indicate that they have been enriched by pisn .",
    "the presence of vms is also not required by either the observed metal ratios in qso broad emission line regions ( venkatesan , schneider & ferrara 2004 ) or by [ si / c ] ratios in high - redshift lyman limit systems ( levshakov et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the recent studies ( see   2 ) of reionization by vms have expanded on the reionization thesis offered by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but they have relied for the most part on that initial study to ground their use of the vms hypothesis in terms of the nucleosynthetic evidence .",
    "although it has been evaluated by observers in their presentation of the data , the independent evidence for the vms hypothesis has not been widely examined in the theoretical literature .",
    "previous studies have in many cases met the _ wmap _ and gunn - peterson constraints on the h  i reionization history of the igm , but they have done so by assuming extreme astrophysical parameters or by assuming the vms hypothesis , which we find to have no firm external justification .",
    "we return to the issue of reionization by the first stars in   5 .",
    "with the nucleosynthetic results in mind , we can now construct a first - stars imf that is consistent with the observations .",
    "to the observational constraints discussed in   3.4 we add the following theoretical motivations for constructing an imf that is deficient in low - mass stars but not skewed to the vms mass range :    * the general astrophysical arguments ( cooling , etc . ) used to motivate a `` top - heavy '' imf still apply . apparently forming massive stars at @xmath56 is a fundamentally different process than it is today .",
    "while tan & mckee ( 2003 ) point out that formation feedback may limit the mass of metal - free stars to @xmath8 30  @xmath1 , they also suggest that there is no known mechanism for halting the accretion below this range ( @xmath87  @xmath1 ) or fragmenting into smaller clumps . on general grounds , this justifies increasing the lower limit of the imf . *",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the ionizing efficiency of metal - free stars increases rapidly from 1  50  @xmath1 , with a plateau at @xmath88 @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we can construct an imf that achieves an ionizing efficiency similar to even a `` strong '' vms model without recourse to stars with @xmath19 @xmath1 .",
    "we propose a first - stars imf that embodies the observational constraints ( 1 , 2 ) and the theoretical arguments ( 3 , 4 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the available nucleosynthetic evidence , and it maximizes the ionizing photon efficiency to meet existing constraints on the reionization without violating those on igm metal enrichment below @xmath89 ( venkatesan & truran 2003 ) . in table 1",
    "we present six new imf cases that meet these criteria .",
    "there are four cases with salpeter slope and varying upper and lower mass limits ( b  d , g ) , and two cases with varying slope ( e  f ) to capture the effects of proportionally more massive star formation in addition to variable mass limits .",
    "we also include a pure - vms imf ( a ) for comparison .",
    "although it is tempting to change the functional form of the imf from a power law to a more complicated function that favors high - mass stars , we avoid this for two reasons .",
    "first , the formation models have not given us specific reason to do so ; they suggest that the mass limits could change but have not yet determined the shape of the distribution .",
    "second , a more general function departing from a power law would introduce another parameter , and the imf slope is already poorly constrained .",
    "even if one knows the imf slope or mass limits , but not both , the inherent degeneracies in the problem may permanently preclude well - justified constraints on the other .",
    "a major part of the imf ( @xmath90  @xmath1 ) leaves little or no nucleosynthetic trace , and so the relative contributions of these stars to the ionizing radiation can not be easily constrained .",
    "thus , there remain significant uncertainties and ambiguities in constraining the first - stars imf .",
    "figure  [ phot ] shows why our proposed imf cases can achieve reionization results similar to vms .",
    "here we show the lifetime - integrated ionizing photon production per baryon ( `` ionizing efficiency '' ) in metal - free stars of 5  500  @xmath1 . up to @xmath91  @xmath1 ,",
    "the models are from tumlinson , shull , & venkatesan ( 2003 ) ; for @xmath12  @xmath1  they are from unpublished models based on the same evolution and stellar atmosphere code , checked for consistency against the results of schaerer ( 2002 )",
    ". the notable features of this plot are the sharp rise to a peak at @xmath92  @xmath1 , followed by a slow decline at higher mass .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the stellar lifetimes decreasing more rapidly than the main - sequence ionizing photon production increases .",
    "this curve shows that an imf that excludes low mass stars and their poor ionizing efficiency can closely approximate the total ionizing photon production of an imf composed purely of vms .",
    "recently , venkatesan & truran ( 2003 ) showed that vms may not be responsible for both reionization and igm metal enrichment , since they produce only about 0.35 ionizing photons per baryon before they cease forming due to metal pollution ( reionization at @xmath93 is thought to require @xmath94 ionizing photons per baryon in the igm , and more are required at higher redshifts ) .",
    "this contradiction would be resolved if the first stars were all vms with @xmath95  @xmath1  and reionization was accomplished by stars that emit ionizing radiation but release no metals .",
    "however , this way is probably closed because no mechanism has been proposed for forming 300  @xmath1  stars without also forming 200  @xmath1  stars in roughly equal or greater proportion .",
    "furthermore , a primordial imf composed exclusively of @xmath95  @xmath1stars would never lead to the observed present - day star formation , as metals would not be released to trigger the transition from the first stars to a local imf ( the enrichment paradox ; schneider et al .",
    ". the only way out of this paradox is to form stars below @xmath96  @xmath1 , where metals would be released by pisn and influence later star formation .",
    "although this argument could be modified by future results from formation models , this probably means that excluding 140  260  @xmath1  also rules out more massive objects .",
    "a key parameter in modeling the radiative and chemical input from the first stars is the duration of the  metal - free \" phase of star formation .",
    "given the complications of an unknown imf , interstellar mixing , and halo merging history , this question is difficult to pose quantitatively . here",
    "we make simplifying assumptions to estimate the enrichment time of small halos at @xmath97 to estimate the time during which metal - free gas is available to form stars .",
    "as noted previously ( tumlinson , shull , & venkatesan 2003 ; vts03 ) , the duration of the metal - free phase determines , with the imf , the total output of ionizing photons from the first massive stars .",
    "as they die , these stars eject heavy elements from supernovae and enrich the surrounding gas within their own halo .",
    "these metals may also be transported across intergalactic space to enrich neighboring halos .",
    "although these enrichment and transport processes are intrinsically complicated , we can make a few relevant calculations that constrain the duration of this metal - free epoch .",
    "our calculations are similar in spirit to those of scannapieco , schneider , & ferrara ( 2003 ) , but we make different assumptions .",
    "first , we compute the _ global _ rate of metal enrichment per unit volume , based on an average star formation rate density ( sfr ) , hereafter quoted in standard units of comoving @xmath98 . by finding high - redshift galaxies through b , v , and @xmath99-band dropouts , steidel et al .",

    "thus , in vts03 , the majority of small halos , in which most of the baryons reside until @xmath194 9 when they merge into larger systems , did not experience any metal - free star formation , even if they had not undergone prior star formation or experienced pollution from neighboring halos .",
    "our treatment here ensures that each halo experiences at least one episode of metal - free star formation prior to cosmological times of @xmath195 gyr .",
    "the assumption of @xmath196  k is somewhat more optimistic from the point of view of early reionization , and relies on the assumption that halos with @xmath197  k can effectively cool with h@xmath22 ( rgs ) . other models ( e.g. , haiman & holder 2003 ) have even more optimistically assumed star formation in halos down to @xmath198  k ; these are not massive enough to form the most massive star in our imf cases ( 1000 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the assumption that each new halo forms metal - free stars breaks down at @xmath199 , when the earliest small halos , presumably metal - enriched from their first star formation , begin to coalesce into larger objects , which are presumably never metal - free .",
    "our models reionize early enough to avoid this complication ( see below ) .    in table 1",
    ", we display the various imfs considered in this work .",
    "we include newly calculated cases that are motivated by the nucleosynthetic data (   4.1 ) and cases that represent a top - heavy imf , either in the form of a higher stellar mass range or of a flatter imf slope , @xmath82 .",
    "also shown are the ionizing photon rates , @xmath200 , for h  i and he  ii from synthetic stellar clusters at a starburst age of 1 myr in units of photons s@xmath201 .",
    "we also show the h  i and he  ii reionization redshifts , @xmath31 , for each case and the total associated @xmath2 ( including the @xmath202% contribution from he  ii ) , assuming that the post - recombination igm ionization fraction is about @xmath203 over @xmath36 20  1000 .",
    "the equivalent ionizing rates for pop ii are @xmath204 s@xmath26 @xmath1@xmath26 and @xmath205 s@xmath26 @xmath1@xmath26 after the transition from pop iii to pop ii assuming a salpeter imf with 1 - 100 @xmath1 , halos with @xmath206 k , and a pop iii to pop ii transition time of 10@xmath207 yr . ] .",
    "we see that an imf derived from the emp nucleosynthetic constraints and lacking in low - mass stars can generate sufficiently early reionization and values of @xmath208 .",
    "this is consistent with current data on reionization without resorting to a top - heavy imf ; high ionizing efficiency need not arise from vms only .",
    "we also note that the uncertainty on @xmath35 from _ wmap _ arises from a broad probability distribution , and that it is degenerate with @xmath209 .",
    "recently , @xmath18 has been determined for _ wmap _ plus the three - dimensional matter power spectrum from sdss ( tegmark et al .",
    "our models reproduce the _ wmap _ result at the @xmath210 confidence level and match the tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) value without resort to vms .",
    "in fact , the close agreement achieved by our imf suggests that the astrophysical parameters ( star formation efficiency , escape fraction ) are now the limiting factors in achieving good constraints on reionization .",
    "we also note that the models from vts03 produced @xmath211 with a more restrictive halo virial temperature cutoff ( @xmath13 k ) and a salpeter imf .",
    "the difference between this @xmath212 and model b shows that the more optimistic halo prescription of the present study contributes only a modest amount .",
    "an important caveat for the results here is that the igm , once reionized completely in h or he , stays ionized . for h",
    "i , if reionization occurs once in the model at some redshift , e.g. , @xmath213 , and if metal - free stars are allowed to keep forming subsequently for @xmath170@xmath157 yr in each new halo , the model igm does not recombine and stays ionized , even though recombinations are explicitly allowed .",
    "this result is probably valid for h  i in the underdense voids , which represent most of the volume in the igm . in the case of h  i in dense regions and he  ii in general",
    ", this behavior may be suspect , owing to high recombination rates at typical igm densities at @xmath214 5 ( shull et al .",
    "however , even if he  iii partially recombined in those of our cases in which he  ii reionization occurs early , the contribution to @xmath2 would be impacted at less than the 10% level .",
    "therefore , our numbers for he  ii should be considered only for the purposes of comparison between various imfs .",
    "this is especially true at @xmath215 where we have not included the ionizing radiation from qsos .",
    "the simple reionization history in our models also does not reproduce the known h i gunn - peterson opacity at @xmath93 or the observed igm temperatures at @xmath216 .",
    "these constraints would require additional input into the models , such as the contribution of quasars to the ionizing photon budget , or a more complicated reionization history than we explore here .",
    "models that attempt to match all available constraints exist in the literature ( see   2 ) .",
    "the additional complications and new parameters would , if they were included in our model , needlessly distract from the goal of directly comparing the different imf cases with the same minimal set of cosmological and astrophysical parameters .",
    "we also note that the @xmath217 gunn - peterson constraint can be met by a modest amount of recombination at @xmath218 , perhaps coincident with the expected pop iii to pop ii transition , with only a modest effect on @xmath212 .",
    "this is possible because even a trace neutral fraction is sufficient to provide @xmath219 with negligible impact on the ionized fraction that scatters photons from the cmb . because these external constraints can be met with minor adjustments to our model , and",
    "because they are incidental to the imf comparisons , we do not include them here .",
    "we close by drawing some important conclusions from the foregoing results and discussion .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the vms hypothesis should be distinguished into two versions : the `` strong '' version ( `` the first stars were exclusively vms '' ) and the `` weak '' version ( `` the first stars included vms and stars with @xmath72  @xmath1 '' ) .",
    "this distinction is necessary because the radiative and nucleosynthesis properties of metal - free stars vary widely across the mass function .",
    "we have demonstrated that these two versions have different testable predictions and can be independently falsified .",
    "the existing samples of metal abundances in emp galactic halo stars , which are commonly thought to trace the enrichment products of the first generation of stars , are better matched to the products of type ii sn and hypernovae like those seen at low redshift .",
    "specifically , the fe - peak and @xmath4-process abundances in emps are not well - matched by vms .",
    "3 .   because they are efficient sources of ionizing photons , vms have been proposed as the ionizing sources for the first stage of the igm reionization and the only means of generating large electron - scattering optical depths seen in cmb maps . by excluding the low - mass end of the imf ,",
    "as suggested by models of primordial protostars , we have constructed imf cases that are just as efficient as vms at converting baryons to ionizing photons . thus constraining the lower mass limit of the imf is perhaps more important for reionization than a constraint on the upper limit .",
    "4 .   direct comparisons of our test imfs in semi - analytic reionization models show that without vms these models can reproduce @xmath35 in the observed range , and similar to vms models with the same astrophysical parameters .",
    "we can simultaneously reproduce the nucleosynthesis and reionization constraints with a single imf .",
    "we confirm earlier studies ( vts03 , wyithe & loeb 2003 ) which found that the lower end of the _ wmap _ range of @xmath212 can be reproduced without recourse to a nonstandard imf .",
    "5 .   with simple metal - transport calculations ,",
    "we derive a timescale for metal - free star formation of @xmath220 yr . by effectively decoupling the earliest stages of ionization and metal - enrichment",
    ", our proposed imf can allow the period of metal - free star formation to persist longer than an imf composed of vms , and perhaps long enough to fully reionize the igm before self - enrichment of halos permanently curtails metal - free star formation .",
    "we have shown that the nucleosynthesis constraints exclude the strong vms hypothesis and have difficulty accommodating the weak vms hypothesis .",
    "we have also shown that an imf without vms can reproduce @xmath221 if it includes stars with @xmath222 @xmath1and @xmath223 if it does not . rather than provide strong evidence for the vms hypothesis , the existing @xmath35 values instead argue against low - mass stars but provide little constraint on massive stars in the imf . in light of the metal - free star formation models , both the high- and low - mass ends of the stellar mass function",
    "are poorly constrained .",
    "it is only when the nucleosynthetic information is added that we can say anything about the imf .    with these uncertainties in mind",
    ", we consider how future developments might bear on the first - stars imf .",
    "first , a tighter range of @xmath35 is necessary to constrain the ionizing efficiency of the first stars , and , indirectly , the imf",
    ". such an improvement might come with additional _ wmap _ data , including polarization correlations .",
    "however , the greatest need is for consistent results from the various combinations of the cmb and additional data ( i.e. , matter power spectrum , ly@xmath82 forest ) that can constrain @xmath2 .",
    "uncertainty of @xmath224 on @xmath35 would leave the astrophysical parameters in a reionization model as the limiting uncertainties ( venkatesan 2002 ) .",
    "it is important to point out that a low @xmath35 does not , by itself , disfavor the vms hypothesis .",
    "because their ionizing efficiency is lower than the peak ( see figure 2 ) , a strong - vms model could give a low @xmath35 with appropriately low star formation efficiency or photon escape fraction ( if reionization is late ) , or with a short time available for metal - free star formation . unless it settles on an extreme high value , @xmath35 is not likely by itself to provide decisive constraints on the imf .",
    "this latter point emphasizes the critical importance of robust constraints from nucleosynthesis as the remaining means of discriminating degenerate imf cases ( such as a strong vms model versus a weak vms model without @xmath225 @xmath1 , see table 1 ) . at the present time ,",
    "emp stars appear to exclude vms .",
    "this could change because of developments in the observations ( new emp stars with lower [ fe / h ] ) or refinements in the theory ( reconciliation of pisn to the fe - peak elements would revitalize the weak vms hypothesis ) .",
    "a particular concern would be evidence that the sample of emp stars we presently take as the `` second generation '' is not , in fact , the product of the first stars . beyond their chemically primitive atmospheres and ages",
    ", there is no hard evidence for this assumption . a new sample of metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath226 could change the outcome if they were better matched to the yields of pisn and/or clearly devoid of @xmath4-process  elements .",
    "there is also room for significant progress on the theoretical front : additional physics such as asymmetry , mass loss , and rotation could be added to the hypernovae and pisn models , perhaps with a corresponding change in the logical basis of the vms hypothesis .",
    "the reionization results in table 1 and the ionizing efficiencies in figure 2 suggest another observational discriminant between our proposed first - stars imf and one composed purely of vms .",
    "although the h  i ionizing efficiency of vms declines from the peak at @xmath227 @xmath1 , the ionizing efficiency for he  ii continues to increase into the vms range .",
    "this feature of vms has two potential observational consequences .",
    "first , vms will be more efficient at producing the he  ii 1640   recombination line , which has been suggested as a key direct signature of the first stars ( tumlinson , giroux , & shull 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "although the many degeneracies in the age and metallicity dependence of the @xmath2281640 line luminosity could give an ambiguous result , an unusually high value could be uniquely attributed to vms .",
    "the second possible signature is more speculative : the he  ii gunn - peterson test at high redshift is , in principle , sensitive to the spectrum of the first ionizing sources .",
    "a vms imf may reionize he  ii in the igm before @xmath102 , while a non - vms imf may or may not ( see table 1 ) .",
    "even if both imfs can produce early he  ii reionization , they may still be discriminated by a gunn - peterson test . to see why , we recall the ratio @xmath229 defined by fardal , giroux , & shull ( 1998 ) to characterize the ionizing sources of the igm .",
    "harder qso - type spectra have @xmath230 , while ordinary stars produce @xmath231 .",
    "the increased he  ii ionizing efficiency of metal - free stars in a normal imf can produce @xmath232 ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ) . by excluding inefficient low - mass stars",
    ", our proposed first - stars imf gives @xmath233 .",
    "a pure vms imf could result in @xmath234 .",
    "recent work at @xmath235 with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( shull et al .",
    "2004 ; zheng et al .",
    "2004 ) has shown that @xmath236 and @xmath237 can be discriminated .",
    "the feasibility of this test would depend largely on the chance combination of a qso with @xmath238 and little intervening absorption of the near - ultraviolet continuum by the common ly@xmath82 forest or lyman limit systems at @xmath239 .",
    "although such a coincidence is unlikely , qsos discovered at @xmath238 should be observed in the near uv to qualify them for this test .",
    "obtaining adequate s / n to accurately measure the predicted low values of the he  ii opacity would likely require a large collecting area in the space ultraviolet , perhaps from a successor to the _ hubble space telescope_. if the practical problems can be overcome , the direct detection of he  ii @xmath2281640 and the high-@xmath39 he  ii gunn - peterson test provide some means of testing the first - stars imf .    finally , we add that , as a theoretical point of interest , the lower mass limit of the imf can be just as important as the better - studied upper limit , because it can determine the total ionizing efficiency of the population .",
    "the lowest mass achievable by metal - free stars may depend on the details of primordial cooling , rotation , fragmentation , feedback , and magnetic fields in unknown ways .",
    "attention has been focused on modeling the formation of very massive first stars ; our results indicate that potential mechanisms for forming low - mass metal - free stars should be pursued .",
    "this is especially true if @xmath240 settles to a high value that requires high ionizing efficiency and the present nucleosynthesis constraints on the strong vms hypothesis are confirmed .",
    "our proposed imf can solve some key puzzles in the study of the first stars and reionization .",
    "however , there are still significant open questions about the formation of metal - free stars ( especially the feedback mechanisms that influence their final masses ) , and the unknown time over which metal - free star formation persists .",
    "furthermore , there may be no high - redshift direct tracers that can independently constrain the proposed imf , especially since its most salient feature is the absence of stars with 1  10  @xmath1  that are not directly observable at high - redshift . until the launch of the _ james webb space telescope _ , which may be able to directly detect the first stars , future work should focus on more sophisticated treatments of the indirect tracers , particularly the emp stars , as sensitive indicators of the first stellar generation .",
    "nonetheless , we have shown that vms are not needed for reionization if the imf is suitably constructed , and that such an imf is better justified on the grounds of the nucleosynthetic data than either version of the vms hypothesis . in the future ,",
    "better understanding of primordial star formation , more refined models of pisn , or a new regime of extremely metal - poor stars with more vms - like metal abundances may change the picture . for now , we conclude only that our proposed imf is better matched to the available constraints .",
