    "circumgalactic space is thought to contain a vast amount of baryons ( e.g.  spitzer 1956 ; fukugita 2004 ) that are both multiphase and dynamic ( e.g.  mo & miralda - escud 1996 , maller & bullock 2004 ) . in principle",
    ", this circumgalactic gas provides the fuel necessary for sustaining star formation in galaxies , while at the same time it is also being replenished with both newly accreted ( and presumably chemically pristine ) intergalactic gas and chemically enriched materials either through gas stripping due to satellite interaction or through starburst driven winds .",

    "a general finding from different studies is that most galaxies are surrounded by chemically enriched gas out to @xmath22 kpc in projected distance .",

    "2013 ) and tidally disrupted satellites ( e.g.  wang 1993 ; gauthier 2013 ) .",
    "a particularly interesting absorption feature to adopt for probing the baryon content of galactic halos is the  doublet .",
    "these doublet transitions are strong and their rest - frame wavelengths , 1548.20 and 1550.77  , enable uniform surveys of chemically enriched gas in the optical window over a broad redshift range from redshift @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "absorbers are found to originate primarily in photoionized gas of temperature @xmath26 k with some contribution from shock heated gas in galaxies and galactic halos ( e.g.  rauch et al .",
    "1997 ; boksenberg et al .  2003 ; simcoe et al .",
    "therefore ,  absorption transitions provide an effective tracer of chemically enriched warm gas in and around star - forming regions .",

    "the increasing  mass density together with an increasing background radiation intensity with decreasing redshift ( e.g. haardt & madau 2012 ) indicate an increasing chemical enrichment level with time in the gas traced by the  absorption transitions ( e.g.  oppenheimer & dav 2008 ) .    at the same time , only three studies have been carried out to characterize extended  gaseous halos around galaxies , two at @xmath30 and one at @xmath31 .",
    "a clear understanding has yet to be established . at @xmath32 , chen et al .",
    "( 2001b ) studied the incidence of  absorbing gas at projected distances @xmath33 kpc from a sample of 50 galaxies .",
    "these authors reported the presence of a distinct boundary at a @xmath34-band luminosity - normalized projected distance of @xmath35 kpc , beyond which no absorbers are detected .",
    "the lack of  absorption is based on a subsample of 35 galaxies that occur at @xmath36 kpc from their background qso sightlines .",
    "in contrast , 14 of the 15 galaxies at @xmath37 kpc have an associated  absorber , although the rest - frame absorption equivalent width , , exhibits a large scatter between individual galaxies . at @xmath31 , steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) examined the mean spatial absorption profiles of 512 galaxies based on stacked spectra of background galaxies that occur at @xmath38 kpc .",
    "these authors found that the mean  absorption strength declines rapidly at projected distances of @xmath39 kpc . comparing the observations of chen et al .",
    "( 2001b ) and steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) yielded little distinction in the -traced circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) at low and high redshifts ( chen 2012 ) .",
    "both the luminosity - normalized spatial extent and mean absorption equivalent width of the cgm around galaxies of comparable mass ( but with very different on - going star formation rate ) have changed little over the redshift interval @xmath40 , although there exists a large scatter in  in the low - redshift study .",
    "nevertheless , a lack of variation in the spatial profile of the chemically enriched cgm between two distinct epochs poses a serious challenge to the theoretical models of gas flows around galaxies ( e.g.  hummels et al .",
    "2013 ; ford et al .",
    "2013a , b ) .    on the other hand , borthakur et al .  (",
    "2013 ) targeted a sample of 20 galaxies at @xmath41 and were able to constrain the incidence of absorbing gas for 17 of these galaxies .",
    "of the 17 galaxies studied , eight occur at @xmath37 kpc and nine at larger distances .",
    "these authors detected  absorbers for three of the eight galaxies at @xmath37 kpc and three of the nine galaxies at @xmath42 kpc in their sample .",
    "the finding of a flat rate of  incidence with increasing projected distance is intriguing and appears to be in stark contrast to the earlier finding of chen et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . while borthakur et al .  attributed the detected  absorbers to starburst activity in the associated galaxies , it is not straightforward to reconcile the discrepant trend found for extended  halos between the chen et al .  and borthakur et al .  samples .",
    "to address the discrepant trend found for extended  halos around galaxies at low redshifts and to improve the empirical understanding of how the chemically enriched cgm evolves with time , we have searched public archives to find spectroscopically identified galaxies at small projected distance to a uv bright , background qso for which high - quality echelle / echellette spectra are already available in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) data archive .",
    "our search has yielded the first large sample of @xmath43 close qso and galaxy pairs that enables a systematic study of extended  halos over the projected distance interval of @xmath44 kpc .",
    "as described below , this unique sample allows us to place unprecedented limits on the extent of chemical enrichment around low - redshift galaxies based on observations of not only the  absorption doublets but also a whole host of ionic transitions from low- and intermediate - ionization states .",
    "recently , tumlinson et al .  ( 2013 ) carried out a large program to use the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; green et al .  2012 ) on board hst to study the cgm at @xmath45 kpc of 44 @xmath46 galaxies at @xmath47 .",
    "this program , known as the `` cos - halos '' survey , was designed to map the multi - phase cgm using ovi and other metal - line diagnostics ( tumlinson et al .",
    "2011 ; werk et al .",
    "the low - redshift cut at @xmath48 was dictated by the requirement of detecting the ovi doublet using cos and the fuv channel .",
    "however , the spectral coverage of the cos fuv gratings misses the civ doublet at @xmath49 , and therefore  transitions are not included in the cos - halos analysis ( e.g.  werk et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "our study differs from the cos - halos program in two fundamental aspects .",
    "first , our search is designed to probe the  absorption in galactic halos for comparisons with high - redshift studies .",
    "second , because fainter galaxies are also more numerous , it is more likely to find a faint foreground galaxy near a qso sightline than a luminous galaxy ( see the discussion is   2 ) . as a result",
    ", low - luminosity ( @xmath50 ) and low - mass ( @xmath51 ) dwarf galaxies contribute to a large fraction ( @xmath52% ) of our random qso and galaxy pair sample .",
    "therefore , _ our study complements the cos - halos effort both in terms of the mass regime of the galaxies and in terms of the ionization state of the cgm_.    here we report initial findings for the low - redshift cgm based on a sample of 195 galaxies for which constraints on the stellar mass are available .",
    "the available stellar mass estimate of each galaxy allows us to infer the total mass of the dark matter in which the galaxy resides ( e.g.  behroozi et al .",
    "2013 ; kravtsov et al .",
    "this in turn allows us to assess the intrinsic size differences between different galaxies based on the estimated dark matter halo radius from a standard halo model . while the cgm is expected to be regulated by various complicated physical processes , including gravitational motion and star formation feedback , addressing the effects of all these processes at once is challenging . as a first step toward establishing a clear understanding of the processes that drive the observed cgm properties , we have designed our study here to account for the intrinsic size differences ( driven by the gravitational potential ) of individual galactic halos by normalizing the observed projected distances with the underlying halo radius .",
    "we expect that the results will facilitate future studies that consider the effect of additional processes such as star formation feedback .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the selection criteria for establishing the close galaxy ",
    "qso pair sample and summarize the properties of the galaxy members in the pair sample . in section 3 , we describe the data reduction and analysis procedures of the absorption spectra of the qsos . in section 4",
    ", we examine the correlation between the strengths of different ionic transitions and galaxy properties , and compare the results of our study with previous findings .",
    "finally , we discuss the implication of our results in section 5 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath53 cosmology , @xmath54 , @xmath55 with a hubble constant @xmath56 .",
    "we have assembled a large sample ( @xmath57 ) of spectroscopically - identified galaxies that occur at small projected distances @xmath58 kpc from the sightline of a background uv bright qso .",
    "this galaxy sample is ideal for characterizing extended gaseous halos around galaxies based on the absorption features imprinted in the spectra of the background qsos .",
    "we first searched the hst archive for qsos that have been observed with either the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ; woodgate et al .",
    "1998 ) or the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; green et al.2012 ) as of cycle 20 .",
    "this search yielded a sample of 150 qsos at @xmath59 .",
    "next , we searched for spectroscopically identified galaxies in public archives , including the nearby general catalog ( ngc ; sinnott 1988 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) spectroscopic galaxy sample , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) galaxies ( huchra et al .  2012 ) , and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "a galaxy and a background qso were considered a suitable pair if they satisfied the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) at the redshift of the galaxy , the physical projected distance @xmath60 between the galaxy and the qso sightline is @xmath61 kpc . ( 2 ) the galaxy must be at @xmath62  below the redshift of the qso to avoid ambiguity between foreground absorbers and those originating in qso outflows ( e.g.  wild et al .  2008 ) . the maximum separation limit of 500 kpc is sufficiently large to encompass the gaseous halos of @xmath46 galaxies known empirically ( e.g.  chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001a ; gauthier et al .  2011 ; prochaska et al .  2011",
    "; rudie et al .  2012 ) .",
    "it is also motivated by theoretical expectations of extended halo gas out to @xmath43 kpc in radius from star - forming regions ( e.g.  ford et al.2013a ) .",
    "therefore , including pairs separated by greater than 300 kpc allows us to explore the presence of chemically enriched gas beyond the fiducial virial radius of dark matter halos .    finally , we formed an `` isolated '' galaxy and qso pair sample by considering only galaxies without close neighbors , in order to minimize the ambiguity in associating an absorber with a galaxy .",
    "previous studies have also shown that galaxies in group environments tend to have more extended halo gas than isolated galaxies that results in a larger scatter in the observed spatial distribution of absorption strength with projected distance ( chen et al .",
    "2010a , bordoloi et al .  2011a , and gauthier & chen 2011 ) .",
    "in our study , a galaxy was considered an `` isolated '' one , if no other galaxies have been spectroscopically identified within projected separation of @xmath63 kpc and velocity separation of @xmath64  were present .",
    "these criteria are driven by the model expectation that an @xmath46 galaxy at @xmath65 has a virial radius of @xmath66 kpc and maximum circular velocity of @xmath67 .",
    "we chosen a more conservative limit to allow for uncertainties in galaxy redshifts .",
    "our search criteria of suitable galaxy and qso pairs yielded a final sample of 213 `` isolated '' galaxies that occur at @xmath68 kpc from the sightline of a background qso for studies of the low - redshift cgm . excluding 18 galaxies that are in the cos - dwarfs program ( bordoloi et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) led to a total of 195 galaxies in our sample .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies range from @xmath69 to @xmath70 with a median of @xmath1 , and the projected distances of the qsos range from @xmath71 kpc to @xmath72 kpc with a median of @xmath2 kpc .",
    "the projected distance versus redshift distribution of the galaxies sample is shown in figure 1 , in which the top and right panels display the histograms in redshift and in projected distance , respectively .    to facilitate a detailed investigation of how the observed cgm absorption properties depend on galaxy properties",

    "derived quantities such as stellar mass ( @xmath74 ) and rest - frame uv and optical absolute magnitudes computed by the k - correct code ( blanton & roweis 2007 ) .",
    "the rest - frame uv absolute magnitudes allows us to estimate an unobscured star formation rate ( sfr ) for each galaxy based on the calibration coefficient of kennicutt & evans ( 2012 ) .",

    "however , to utilize the full `` isolated '' galaxy sample for investigating how the observed cgm absorption properties depend on galaxy properties , we needed to estimate the stellar mass for each of the remaining 100 galaxies based on available photometric data .",
    "we used the subsample of 111 galaxies as a guide . comparing the stellar mass provided by the nasa ",
    "sloan atlas with intrinsic luminosities in different bandpasses revealed a tight correlation between @xmath74 and rest - frame absolution @xmath76-band magnitude , @xmath77 , over four orders of magnitude in @xmath74 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "based a linear regression analysis , we find that the @xmath74 vs.  @xmath77 correlation is best characterized by @xmath83 with a 1-@xmath79 scatter of @xmath80 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) enables us to obtain a stellar mass estimate and associated uncertainty for galaxies based on @xmath77 . in figure 2",

( 2010 ) .",
    "recall that we measured an unobscured sfr for each galaxy based on the observed nuv flux without correcting for possible dust extinction .",
    "therefore , our measurements likely represent lower limits to the intrinsic sfr .",
    "the tilt in the distribution of our galaxies relative to the mean relation of star - forming main - sequence galaxies can be explained by the observed correlation between dust extinction and stellar mass , namely more massive galaxies on average exhibit higher degrees of dust extinction ( e.g.  zahid et al .",

    "we can not include the earlier  measurements of chen et al.(2001b ) because the mass of each galaxy is unknown .",

    "first , the qsos in our pair sample probe regions as close as @xmath183 in galactic halos to @xmath184 outside of galactic halos .",
    "while  absorbers are frequently observed at projected distances much beyond @xmath6 , no ionic transitions are found at these large radii .",
    "the few detections at @xmath164 kpc turn out to be associated with most massive galaxies in the sample and the qso sightlines appear to still probe the inner halos of these galaxies .",
    "the large sample allows us for the first time to place stringent limits on the possible presence of heavy elements beyond galactic halos .",
    "we place a strict _ upper limit _ of 3% ( at a 95% confidence level ) on the incidence of @xmath185   metal - line absorbers over the range of projected distances from @xmath6 to @xmath186 ( see   4.5 and figure 11 below ) .",
    "second , the cos - halos sample probes the metal - enriched cgm over the projected distance range from @xmath187 to @xmath188 . recall that the median mass of the cos - halos sample at @xmath89 is @xmath189 ( werk et al .",
    "2013 ) , while our galaxy sample spans a broad range in stellar mass with a median @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , the cos - halos sample probes primarily the inner halos of massive galaxies and our galaxy sample extends to outer halos of lower- and high - mass galaxies . the observed absorption strengths versus @xmath6-normalized projected distance from the cos - halos observations now connect smoothly with the measurements for our sample .",
    "these include hi , cii , siii , siiii , and siiv .",
    "the on average stronger absorbers found around cos - halos galaxies can therefore be explained by higher gas density in the inner halos , at least around massive galaxies .",
    "considering our sample with the cos - halos sample together shows that both the absorption strengths and incidence ( covering fraction ) of heavy elements decline steeply beyond @xmath191 and no heavy ions are detected beyond @xmath192 .    finally , the starburst galaxy sample probes the metal - enriched cgm at @xmath15 over the projected distance range from @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "the mean absorption strength of the metal - enriched cgm around starburst galaxies at @xmath15 is found to decline rapidly at beyond @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the observed mean absorber strengths at a fixed @xmath179 remain to be stronger around these starburst galaxies than what is observed around either low - mass dwarf or high - mass galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "the differential observed absorption strength versus @xmath6-normalized projected distance between low- and high - redshift galaxy samples suggests for the first time that the spatial absorption profile of the cgm may have evolved since @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "chen 2012 ) .",
    "however , a direct comparison between the low- and high - redshift measurements is difficult because the high - redshift measurements were made in stacked spectra which presumably includes detections and non - detections among galaxies with a broad mass range ( table 3 ) , and there was no distinction made between independent and group galaxies .",
    "an additional uncertainty also arises due to uncertainties in halo models ( diemer et al .  2013 ; see further discussions in ",
    "5.3 ) .          to further improve upon the sensitivity in searching for weak absorption features and to facilitate a more direct comparison between our study and that of steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we experiment with co - adding the absorption spectra of individual galaxies in the rest frame .",
    "we note , however , that interpreting the comparisons between low- and high - redshift measurements is not trivial ( see   5.3 for discussion ) .    for each input spectrum , we first mask contaminating features due to either the milky way interstellar medium or other strong absorbers at redshifts different from the foreground galaxy .",
    "then each continuum normalized qso spectrum and its associated error spectrum are shifted to the rest frame of the foreground galaxy . to account for the velocity offset between a galaxy and its associated absorbing gas ( figure 6 ) ,",
    "the rest frame of each galaxy is set to be the redshift of the observed  absorber . for galaxies with no detected  absorbers ,",
    "the rest frame is set to be the systemic redshift of the galaxy .",
    "individual rest - frame spectra are then weighted and stacked to form a final mean spectrum .",
    "the weighting factor of each spectrum is defined as the inverse median variance which is determined using the associated error spectrum over the wavelength range from 1100   to 1450   in g130 m data and from 1390   to 1750 in g160 m data ( e.g.  columns 5 and 6 in table 2 ) .",
    "we form different stacked cgm spectra for galaxies grouped in different projected distance intervals , as well as in different @xmath6-normalized projected distance intervals . given that a large fraction of detected heavy ions occur at @xmath45 kpc ( left panels of figures 7 & 8) ,",
    "we have adopted the first bin in projected distances to include galaxies at @xmath45 kpc and divided the remaining galaxies into three projected distance intervals with roughly equal number ( @xmath195 ) of galaxies . for @xmath6-normalized measurements ( right panels of figures 7 & 8) , we have adopted the same binning as the high - redshift starburst galaxy sample at @xmath196 and divided the rest of the galaxy sample into two @xmath179 bins with roughly equal number ( @xmath197 ) of galaxies .",
    "the stacked cgm spectra for different @xmath6-normalized distance intervals are presented in figure 9 . in each stacked cgm spectrum ,",

    "the final stacks may be dominated by one or two high @xmath101 sightlines . to assess these sampling errors ,",
    "we employ a bootstrap resampling technique .    for each subsample",
    ", we randomly sample the galaxies with replacement to construct a new subsample that contains the same number of input galaxies for stacking .",
    "we then measure the mean absorption equivalent width or a 2-@xmath79 upper limit if no absorption features are found in the new stack .",
    "we repeat this exercise @xmath198 times and examine the distribution of the resulting mean absorption measurements .",
    "we find that a convergence is reached in the distribution when @xmath199 .",
    "we adopt the 1-@xmath79 dispersion from the bootstrap resampling distribution as the uncertainties in the observed mean absorption in stacked spectra . in the case of non - detections , we quote the 95% upper bound of the distribution as the 2-@xmath79 upper limit to the underlying absorption strength . the measurements and associated uncertainty estimates , as well as upper limits for non - detections",
    "are included in figures 7 and 8 as solid blue points .",
    "the results are also summarized in tables 5 and 6 , which record for each distance interval the range of projected distance @xmath60 ( or @xmath179 ) , median projected distance @xmath200 ( or @xmath201 ) , the number of galaxies included in the stack , and the mean absorption strengths in , siiii , siii , siiv , cii , and civ . both tables",
    "5 & 6 and figure 9 confirm that with higher @xmath101 in the stacked spectra the mean  absorption strength declines steadily with increasing projected distance , while no heavy ions are detected at 95% upper limits of @xmath202   at @xmath203 .",
    "the strong upper limits presented in tables 5 and 6 for non - detections demonstrate that using stacked spectra we are indeed able to improve the constraints for the presence / absence of absorbing gas by @xmath204 .",

    "in addition , comparing the absorption - line measurements made in stacked cgm spectra confirms that massive starburst galaxies at @xmath15 ( green symbols in the right panels of figures 7 & 8) exhibit significantly stronger mean cgm absorption than the present - day galaxies ( solid blue points ) .",
    "the differences are most pronounced in low - ionization species traced by cii and siii absorption features .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the comparable mean absorption strengths of mgii absorbers found at fixed luminosity - normalized projected distances ( chen 2012 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is less for higher ionization species such as siiv and civ .",
    "most interestingly , while we observe strong differential mean absorption strengths in different ionization states , such as between siii and siiv and between cii and civ , the mean absorption strengths of different ions appear to be comparable at large distances from starburst galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "the comparable strengths between low- and high - ionization transitions suggests that either the ionization condition in the high - redshift cgm is very different or the lines are saturated ( in contrast to the non - saturated lines observed in our low - redshift sample ) and therefore the line widths are driven by the underlying velocity field of the gas .",
    "we have shown in   4.4 that stacked cgm spectra enable strong limits on the possible presence of heavy elements outside of galactic halos , namely at projected distances @xmath10 .",
    "within galactic halos , however , the observed mean absorption strength in a finite distance interval is the product of the spatial absorption profile and partial gas covering .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show that not only does the absorption equivalent widths of individual absorbers decrease with increasing distance , but the fraction of detections also decreases with increasing distance .",
    "an independent measure of the gas covering fraction is therefore necessary for an accurate characterization of the spatial absorption profile of the cgm .",

    "starburst driven outflows are thought to be particularly effective in removing baryons from low - mass halos because of a shallow potential well ( e.g.  larson 1974 ; martin 1999 ) .",
    "energetic outflows are also expected to suppress continuing growth of low - mass galaxies due to a reduced accretion rate ( e.g.  scannapieco et al .",
    "these effects together can explain known scaling relations such as the mass - metallicity relation found in dwarf galaxies ( e.g.  dekel & woo 2003 ) .",
    "however , model that predict enrichment levels to @xmath252 solar metallicity are inconsistent with the observed limits we obtain at @xmath253 from low - mass dwarf galaxies at @xmath16 .",

    "a possible explanation is to attribute the observed  absorbers to outflows driven by on - going star - formation activity , which indeed was part of the selection criterion of the borthakur et al .  sample .",
    "however , two of the galaxies with associated strong  absorbers are classified as quiescent galaxies with little on - going star formation since recent past .",

    "however , to produce the sharp downturn at @xmath9 would require a sharp decline in metallicity , which essentally indicates a finite edge of chemical enrichment and motivates the consideration of a turn - around radius of starburst driven outflows .    in this scenario",
    ", we can infer the launch speed as a function of launch radius of the outflows in individual halos . adopting a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ; navarro et al .",

    "naturally , a larger launch speed is required in more massive halos in order to reach out to a larger distance . because more massive galaxies on average are forming stars at a higher rate ( e.g.  salim et al .",
    "2007 ) , it is conceivable to have a higher outflow speed from starburst driven winds in a more massive galaxy . with a larger sample , we will be able to examine whether / how the metal - line boundary depends on star formation activity .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed finite metal - line boundary at @xmath9 is the critical radius below which cool clouds can develop and stabilize in a multi - phase medium ( e.g.  maller & bullock 2004 ; mccourt et al .",
    "2012 ) . specifically , mccourt et al.(2012 ) showed that hot halos can develop extended multiphase structures if the cooling time @xmath282 is comparable to or less than the dynamical time @xmath283 . given that @xmath284 and @xmath285 , the ratio @xmath286 decreases rapidly with decreasing radius .",
    "while the details depend on the exact density profile of the hot halo , it is conceivable that such condition can be reached at @xmath192 .",
    "both the turn - around radius of starburst outflows and cooling radius of a hot halo can provide a physical explanation for the observed metal - line boundary .",
    "because the former requires on - going star formation to provide the energy input , one can in principle distinguish between the two scenarios by examining whether or not the presence of a metal - line boundary depends on the star formation activity in the galaxies .      when comparing a luminosity - normalized spatial extent of the cgm at different redshifts , chen ( 2012 ) found that no distinctions can be made between low- and high - redshift galaxies that have dissimilar star formation histories .",
    "the adopted luminosity normalization was meant to account for a likely luminosity - size scaling relation commonly seen in optical disks ( e.g.  cameron & driver 2007 ) .",
    "this approach was motivated by the expectation that the cgm is regulated by various complicated physical processes , including gravitational motion and star formation feedback . normalizing the observed projected distance by the intrinsic luminosity offers a means of accounting for the intrinsic size differences of individual galactic halos , and represents the first step toward establishing a clear understanding of the processes that drive the observed cgm properties .",
    "the results will facilitate future studies that consider the effect of additional processes such as star formation feedback .",
    "but while rest - frame @xmath34-band luminosity ( @xmath287 ) is a good proxy of mass as shown in chen et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , it is an indirect measure of galaxy mass .",
    "our study presented here utilizes a sample of galaxies with known stellar masses and normalizes the observed extent of halo gas by the inferred dark matter halo radius under a simple spherical overdensity approximation ( e.g.  maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "the finding in ",
    "4.3 is surprisingly very different from the finding of chen ( 2012 ) .",
    "specifically , when accounting for a size - scaling based on halo mass ( instead of rest - frame @xmath34-band luminosity ) , high - redshift starburst galaxies exhibit both systematically stronger mean absorption strength at a fixed @xmath6-normalized projected distance at @xmath288 and more extended chemically - enriched gas to @xmath203 than low - redshift galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the differences in the mean absorption strengths of the low- and high - redshift cgm are most pronounced in low - ionization species traced by cii and siii absorption lines , suggesting distinct ionization conditions between the cgm at @xmath289 and at high redshifts near starburst galaxies .",
    "we note , however , that a fundamental difference between the low- and high - redshift measurements is the treatment of galaxies with close neighbors . in our study",
    "presented here , we have considered only `` isolated '' galaxies with no known close neighbors spectroscopically identified within 500 kpc in projected distance and @xmath290  in velocity separation .",
    "no such distinction was made in the high - redshift sample , and therefore the high - redshift cgm measurements include both isolated galaxies and those with neighbors .",
    "it has been suggested that galaxies in group environments display a more extended , chemically enrichment halo gas than galaxies in the field ( e.g.  chen et al .",
    "2010a ; bordoloi et al .",
    "2011 ) . at the same time , the overall cool gas content is also found suppressed in galaxy groups ( e.g.chynoweth et al .",
    "it is not clear that the more extended , strong cgm absorption around high - redshift starburst galaxies is due to a signigicant contribution of galaxies in group environments .",
    "a detailed study of the cgm in different group environments at low redshifts will be presented in a separate paper ( liang et al .",
    "2014 in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) noted that the siii absorption lines are saturated at @xmath291 kpc in the stacked low - resolution spectra .",
    "on the other hand , the ionic transitions observed in individual galaxies at low redshifts are not commonly saturated .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "interpreted the observed declining absorption equivalent width ( at least from @xmath292 to @xmath293 kpc ) as likely due to a combination of decreasing line - of - sight velocity spread and decreasing covering fraction of the absorbing gas .",
    "in contrast , observations individual galaxies at low redshift indicate that the declining mean absorption equivalent width in stacked spectra is best explained by a declining gas covering fraction along with declining optical depth with increasing projected distance .",
    "consequently , interpreting the observed difference between low- and hig - redshift observations becomes more complicated .    at @xmath294 kpc ,",
    "however , steidel et al .  (",
    "2010 ) also pointed out that the ionic absorption lines appeared to become unsaturated around high - redshift starburst galaxies . for unsaturated lines in stacked spectra ,",
    "the observed declining equivalent width is best explained by a declining gas covering fraction along with a declining optical depth , similar to the low - redshift observations .",
    "comparisons between our means stacked spectra and those from steidel et al .  could therefore be made for observations at @xmath294 kpc .",
    "remaining caveats include redshift uncertainties .",
    "individual spectra of these high - redshift galaxies",
    "are of low @xmath101 and low spectral resolution with @xmath295 . random motions between galaxies and the absorbing gas ( e.g.  figure 6 ) can smooth out the signal .",
    "chen ( 2012 ) performed a simple monte carlo simulation to show that these uncertainties can result in an overall reduction of the absorption strength by @xmath296% , increasing the discrepancy between low- and high - redshift samples . at the same time",
    ", uncertainties in sky subtraction of low @xmath101 spectra may also bias the continuum estimate that is difficult to assess .",
    "it is expected that these uncertainties can be resolved with absorption spectroscopy of background qsos near individual starburst galaxies ( e.g.  rudie et al .  2012 ; turner et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we note , however , that a fundamental caveat in comparing @xmath6-normalized cgm profiles at different redshifts is in how @xmath6 is calculated .",
    "equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) outlines a commonly adopted approach to calculate halo mass @xmath75 and halo radius @xmath6 based on a spherical overdensity model .",
    "a dark matter halo is defined as a collapsed and virialized object with a mean enclosed density equal to @xmath175 times the mean background density @xmath297 at the redshift of interest . by this definition ,",

    "consequently , both @xmath75 and @xmath6 would increase with time even for a static halo .",
    "such pseudo - evolution of dark matter halos has been investigated by several groups , and a consistent finding in numerical simulations is that most halos of @xmath298 completed matter accretion by @xmath299 with little / no net growth in mass over the last seven billion years ( e.g.  prada et al .",
    "2006 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ; diemer et al .  2013 ) . therefore ,",

    "a pseudo - evolution in dark matter halo mass ( and therefore halo radius @xmath6 ) has important implications beyond a constant cgm radial absorption profile .",
    "it would also suggest that chemical enrichment have reached out to the `` edge '' of the dark matter halo ( @xmath312 ) or likely beyond , although a clear border for the observed metal - line absorbers outside of halo radius still implies a finite extent of chemical enrichment around galaxies . to quantify the extent of chemical enrichment , we will rely on numerical simulations as a guide for determining the physical size of the underlying dark matter halos of our galaxies .",
    "such study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we defer the analysis to a future paper ( liang et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .    given the uncertainty in @xmath6 and @xmath272 from dark matter halo models , we return to applying empirical properties of the galaxies for scaling halo gas properties . instead of @xmath34-band luminosity , however , we consider normalizing the projected distance of galaxies by stellar mass , @xmath74 .",

    "<S> this paper presents an absorption - line study of the multiphase circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) based on observations of , cii , civ , siii , siiii , and siiv absorption transitions in the vicinities of 195 galaxies at redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy sample is established based on a cross - comparison between public galaxy and qso survey data and is characterized by a median redshift of @xmath1 , a median projected distance of @xmath2 kpc to the sightline of the background qso , and a median stellar mass of @xmath3 . comparing the absorber features identified in the qso spectra with known galaxy properties </S>",
    "<S> has led to strong constraints for the cgm absorption properties at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> first , abundant hydrogen gas is observed out to @xmath5 kpc , well beyond the dark matter halo radius @xmath6 of individual galaxies , with a mean covering fraction of @xmath7% . in contrast , no heavy elements are detected at @xmath8 from either low - mass dwarfs or high - mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of detected heavy elements in low- and high - ionization states suggests that either there exists a chemical enrichment edge at @xmath9 or gaseous clumps giving rise to the observed absorption lines can not survive at these large distances . </S>",
    "<S> considering all galaxies at @xmath10 leads to a strict _ upper limit _ for the covering fraction of heavy elements of @xmath11% ( at a 95% confidence level ) over @xmath12 . at @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> differential covering fraction between low- and high - ionization gas is observed , suggesting that the cgm becomes progressively more ionized from @xmath14 to larger distances . </S>",
    "<S> comparing cgm absorption observations at low and high redshifts shows that at a fixed - fraction of @xmath6 the cgm exhibits stronger mean absorption at @xmath15 than at @xmath16 and that the distinction is most pronounced in low - ionization species traced by cii and siii absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible pseudo - evolution of the cgm as a result of misrepresentation of halo radius , and present a brief discussion on the implications of these findings .    </S>",
