    "with the hopes to explain a number of cosmological problems covering dark energy , accelerated expansion , quantum gravity and many related matters , extensions / modifications of general relativity theory gained momentum anew during the recent decade .",
    "each extension adds new degrees of freedom and accommodates new parameters apt for the sake of better physics .",
    "lovelock gravity @xcite , for instance , constitutes one such extension which abides by the ghost free combinations of higher order invariants resulting in second order equations alone .",
    "next higher order to the einstein - hilbert extension in this hierarchy came to be known as the gauss - bonnet extension @xcite which makes use of the quadratic invariants . apart from this hierarchy , arbitrary dependence on the ricci scalar @xmath3 which has been popular in recent times",
    "is known as the @xmath0 gravity ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein and for a review paper see @xcite ) . compared to other theories which employ tensorial invariants this sounds simpler and the fact that the ghosts are eliminated makes it attractive @xcite . the simplest form ,",
    "namely @xmath4 is the well - known einstein - hilbert lagrangian which constitutes the simplest theory of gravity . given the simplest theory in hand , why to investigate complex versions of it ?",
    "the idea is to add new degrees of freedom through non - linearities , create curvature sources that may be counterbalanced by the energy - momentum of some physical sources .",
    "once @xmath4 , passes all the classical experimental tests any function @xmath0 may be interpreted as a self - similar version of @xmath4 , creating no serious difficulties at the classical level . introducing an effective newtonian constant as a matter of fact plays a crucial role in this matter . at the quantum level",
    ", however , problems such as unitarity , renormalizability of the linearized theory are of vital importance to be tackled with .    as an example we refer to the particular form @xmath5 ( @xmath6 rational number ) @xcite .",
    "this admits , among others an exact solution which simulates the geometry of a charged object i.e. the reissner - nordstrm geometry @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath5 behaves geometrically as if we have @xmath7 ( electrostatic field ) .",
    "remarkably , the power @xmath8 plays the role of `` charge '' so that the geometry @xmath5 becomes locally isometric to the geometry of reissner - nordstrm . in a similar manner",
    "various combinations of polynomial forms plus @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and other functions of @xmath3 can be considered as potential candidates for @xmath0 .",
    "some of these have already appeared in the literature @xcite . beside the case of @xmath11 ( electrostatic field ) , and more aptly , cases such as @xmath7 ( non - minimal scalar field ) cases also have been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , the non - minimal yang - mills fields coupled with @xmath0 gravity has also been studied @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that yang - mills ( ym ) field can be accommodated within the context of metric @xmath0 gravity as well . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such a study , especially in higher dimensions which constitutes our main motivation , is absent in the literature .",
    "while numerical solutions to the problem of black holes in @xmath12ym theory 9 started to appear in the literature our interest is in finding exact solutions .",
    "it should be added also that the class of black holes in @xmath0 gravity can be distinct from the well - known classes such as myers - perry ( in @xcite ) .",
    "some classes of black holes in this paper also obey this rule since they are not asymptotically flat in the usual sense .",
    "we show that in most of our solutions asymptotically ( i.e. @xmath13 ) an effective cosmological constant can be identified which depends on the dimension of spacetime , ym charge @xmath14 and the integration parameters .",
    "herein , we do not propose an @xmath0 lagrangian a priori , instead we determine the @xmath0 function in accordance with the ym sources .",
    "by using the wu - yang ansatz for the ym field @xcite it is shown that a general class of solutions can be obtained in the @xmath0 gravity where the geometric source matches with the energy - momentum of the ym field .",
    "let us note that the wu - yang ansatz works miraculously in all higher dimensions which renders possible to solve @xmath0 gravity not only in @xmath15 , but in all @xmath16 as well .",
    "further , the zero trace condition for the energy - momentum is imposed to obtain conformal invariant solutions which constitutes a particular class .",
    "although our starting point is the non - linear ym field in which the lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the ym invariant our main concern is the special limit , namely , the linear ( or standard ) ym theory .",
    "power - law type non - linearity is a well - known class which we consider as an example and as we have shown elsewhere @xcite the choice of the power plays a crucial role in the satisfaction of the energy conditions , i.e. weak , strong or dominant .",
    "essentially , conformal invariant property is one of the reasons that we consider power - ym ( pym ) field in higher dimensions .",
    "the implementation of zero trace condition for the energy - momentum tensor becomes relatively simpler in this pym class .",
    "as in the example of born - infeld electrodynamics case which plays crucial role in resolution of point like singularities , in analogy , similar expectations can be associated with the non - linear version of the ym theory .",
    "such non - linearities resemble the self - interacting scalar fields which serve to define different vacua in quantum field theory .",
    "more to that , in general relativity the non - linear terms effect black hole formation significantly , it is therefore tempting to take such combinations seriously .",
    "it is our belief that with the non - linear ym field we can establish effective cosmological parameters to contribute , in accordance with the energy conditions cited above , to the distinction between the phantom and quintessence data of our universe .",
    "this is a separate problem of utmost importance that should be considered separately .",
    "we show that , the choice @xmath2 in @xmath1dimensions yields an exact solution for @xmath0 gravity coupled with ym fields which is non - asymptotically flat / non - de sitter in the sense that it contains deficit angles at @xmath17 other classes of solutions that are asymptotically de sitter , unfortunately ca nt be expressed in a closed form as @xmath18     organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
