    "in process specification language ( psl ) , the ordering of event ( activity ) occurrences is modelled using occurrence trees , which are restricted forms of partial orders .",
    "although partial orders can sufficiently model the  earlier than \" relationship , they can not _ explicitly _ model the  not later than \" relationship @xcite .",
    "for instance , if an event @xmath0 is performed  not later than \" an event @xmath1 , then this  not later than \" relationship can be modelled by the following set of two step sequences @xmath2 , where the _ step _ @xmath3 models the simultaneous performance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "but the set @xmath4 can not be represented by any partial order .    to provide a unified framework for analyzing `` earlier than '' and ``",
    "not later than '' relationships , we proposed to interpret the _ generalized stratified order structure _ ( _ gso - structure _ ) theory within psl .",
    "the gso - structure theory is originated from causal partial order theory and _ stratified order structure _ ( _ so - structure _ ) theory .",

    "they have been successfully applied to model inhibitor and priority systems , asynchronous races , synthesis problems , etc .",
    "( see for example @xcite and others ) .",
    "however , so - structures can adequately model concurrent histories only when the paradigm @xmath9 of @xcite is satisfied .",
    "paradigm @xmath9 says that if two event occurrences are observed in both orders of execution , then they will also be observed executing simultaneously . without this assumption ,",

    "intuitively , gso - structures can model even the situation when we have the mixture of `` true concurrency '' and interleaving semantics .",
    "the only disadvantage is that gso - structures are more complex to conceptualize than so - structures .    since the works of janicki et al .",
    "@xcite focus on the algebraic properties of gso - structures , the number of axioms are kept to minimal and some of the assumptions are made implicit .",
    "furthermore , the theorems of gso - structure theory frequently involve quantifying over relations , which requires the use of higher - order language .",
    "hence , to apply first - order ontology and model - theoretic techniques in the manner as in @xcite , we will first define a formal ontology for gso - structure in first - order logic and characterize all possible models of gso - structure theory up to isomorphism .",
    "after that we can proceed to investigate to what extend the theorems of gso - structure theory hold within the first - order setting of psl by studying possible ontological mappings from gso - structure theory to psl .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we will give a first - order axiomatization of the gso - structure theory and end the section will a result showing that our theory is consistent . in section  3 , we will classify all possible models of the gso - structure theory from section  2 using more natural and intuitive concepts from graph theory . in section  4 , we study a semantic mapping from our theory to psl - core theory .",
