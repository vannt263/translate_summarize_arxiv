    "nearly all low - mass stars are believed to have magnetic fields that influence their surroundings and evolution .",
    "young stars with ages less than 1020 myr exhibit high - energy activity in the form of hot coronal loops , flares , accretion shocks , and open - field regions with winds or jet - like outflows ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . because the magnetic fields of the star and disk are threaded together with one another , it is often difficult to disentangle the contributions from various proposed sources of activity . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation may be greatly simplified for older stars that have evolved past the classical t  tauri phase .",
    "these stars have lost their dense gas disks , and thus the major remaining contributor to the star s ultraviolet and x - ray emission is the presence of magnetic coronal loops . in that case , the subsequent evolution of a star s _ coronal heating _ as it starts main sequence hydrogen burning may no longer involve drastic changes in the source regions , but instead just be the result of a gradual evolution in parameters related to its magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) dynamo @xcite .",
    "pre - main - sequence stars with debris disks are ideal targets for studying the earliest stages of non - accretion - driven magnetic activity . in this paper",
    "we focus on au microscopii ( hd 197481 , gj 803 ) , a nearby m1ve flare star with a well - resolved debris disk .",
    "having an effective temperature of @xmath03500 k , au  mic probably is not fully convective like the later - type m dwarfs .",
    "thus , its mhd dynamo may be qualitatively similar to those of more massive stars like the sun .",
    "au  mic is bright in x - rays @xcite , rich in ultraviolet flaring phenomena @xcite , and surrounded by an edge - on dust disk with a mass of roughly 1 @xmath1 and a spatial extent similar to the kuiper belt in our solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite observed au  mic at millimeter wavelengths with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "in addition to the kuiper - like dust belt , they were able to distinguish a compact central emission peak with a flux of @xmath0320 @xmath2jy .",
    "the origin of this component is not yet known .",
    "the m dwarf s stellar photosphere would generate a blackbody flux of only about 60 @xmath2jy at @xmath3 mm , a factor of 5 smaller than the observed emission peak . in order for a star - sized blackbody to be responsible for the observed emission , it would need to have a temperature of roughly 17,000 k. this kind of dominant chromospheric emission was predicted by @xcite for cool evolved giants , but those stars have much larger emitting areas and no significant coronal emission .",
    "an m dwarf like au  mic may have a thin chromosphere underneath its hot corona , but its optical depth is not likely to be high enough to generate a photosphere - like blackbody spectrum .",
    "@xcite suggested that the central emission peak of au  mic may be produced by an inner `` asteroid belt '' of cool dust grains or planetesimals within @xmath03 au of the star .",
    "only about 0.01 @xmath1 worth of dust material needs to be present to generate the observed emission peak ; this is comparable to the mass of the asteroid belt in our solar system . @xcite",
    "also computed upper limits on the required temperatures of silicate grains in this proposed belt and found values of 3575 k. this range is the same order of magnitude as the expected dust temperatures at a distance of @xmath4 au from an m dwarf .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternate explanation for the alma central emission component of au  mic .",
    "since this star has such strong x - ray emission , we explored the possibility that a collection of _ hot coronal loops _ on its surface could be responsible for similarly strong thermal emission at 1.3 mm .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] illustrates the suggested mhd circumstellar environment , where magnetic loops with a continuous distribution of sizes are assumed to fill the corona with @xmath5 k plasma .",
    "we aim to create a single model of these loops that reproduces the available observations at x - ray and millimeter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite also explored the use of radio continuum measurements as constraints to models of m dwarf coronal heating . in a way",
    ", this paper follows on from the general ideas described by @xcite , but our models are based on self - consistent physical sources of plasma heating inspired by recent advances in understanding the sun s well - resolved corona .    in section  [ sec : model ] of this paper , we describe the model of coronal heating that we apply to au  mic .",
    "section  [ sec : radio ] summarizes how we synthesize observable quantities in the x - ray , radio , and millimeter wavelength bands for later comparison with observations . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the computed coronal loop parameters for au  mic as well as synthetic x - ray luminosities and radio / mm spectra . section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper with a brief summary of the main results and suggestions for future improvements .",
    "in this section we describe a model of turbulence - driven coronal activity motivated by the present - day sun .",
    "the model adopts a time - steady description of coronal heating and does not attempt to simulate the full range of intermittent and chaotic mhd dynamics that is evident in high - resolution solar images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , such a phenomenological description of turbulence has been shown to accurately reproduce many properties of coronal heating and wind acceleration for the sun @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite showed how this model performs well in predicting the x - ray activity of young stars undergoing active accretion , and @xcite used the model to compute the mass - loss rates of stellar winds for stars with a wide range of ages and masses .",
    "the basic idea is that magnetic field lines at the stellar photosphere are continually jostled by a stochastic source of mechanical energy , and this gives rise to mhd waves that propagate up to larger heights and eventually dissipate . in tandem with wave generation ,",
    "the random footpoint motions produce an increase in the overall magnetic energy via the twisting , shear , and braiding of field lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the transport and dissipation of magnetic energy from both waves and braiding can be described using the unifying language of _ turbulent cascade _ @xcite .",
    "the presence of radiative cooling in such a system produces a thermal instability that often leads to the coexistence of a cool ( @xmath6 k ) chromosphere and a hot ( @xmath7 k ) corona . in the ionized corona",
    ", heat conduction also makes for a `` thermostat '' effect in which the time - steady spatial distribution of @xmath8 is much smoother than the spatial distribution of the heating rate .",
    "there are several possible sources of stochastic mechanical energy at the photospheric base .",
    "convective granulation surely plays a major role for most low - mass stars @xcite . for stars undergoing active accretion",
    ", an additional source of energy can exist in the form of ripples from the impact of gas clumps falling down from above @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the presence of planets in a magnetized stellar wind may give rise to mhd fluctuations that propagate back down to the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we will treat the total available mechanical energy flux at the photosphere as a free parameter .",
    "we describe the star itself by its fundamental parameters ( mass , radius , luminosity , and metallicity ) and ignore rotation .",
    "the dynamics of the jostled magnetic flux tubes are described by three additional parameters defined at the photosphere : mass density @xmath9 , magnetic field strength @xmath10 , and the mean energy flux @xmath11 of alfvn waves that propagate upwards as a result of the stochastic motion . to compute the density as a function of effective temperature @xmath12 and gravity @xmath13 , we used the standard criterion that the rosseland mean optical depth @xmath14 should have a value of @xmath15 in the photosphere , which demands @xmath16 the rosseland mean opacity @xmath17 was interpolated from tables given by @xcite , and we defined the density scale height in the photosphere as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "@xcite found that , for cool - star photospheres , the mean atomic weight @xmath2 is a relatively slowly varying function of @xmath12 ; we used their parameterization .    to specify the photospheric magnetic field strength",
    ", we assumed that @xmath10 remains linearly proportional to the so - called equipartition field strength ( i.e. , the value at which magnetic pressure balances gas pressure ) .",
    "we used the proportionality constant found from observations by @xcite to specify @xmath21 for the footpoints of coronal loops .",
    "the alfvn wave energy flux can be written in terms of the surface velocity amplitude @xmath22 of transverse mhd waves , with @xmath23 , and the alfvn speed is given by @xmath24 .",
    "we can make an initial estimate of the expected velocity amplitude using turbulent convection models .",
    "@xcite used the models of @xcite for main sequence and evolved stars .",
    "we find below , however , that for au mic the @xcite models predict an amplitude that is far too small to explain its observed coronal heating and x - ray activity .",
    "( our understanding of the magnetic dynamos of young , rapidly rotating stars is still incomplete ; see section [ sec : conc ] . )    in general , we assume that magnetic flux tubes fill only a fraction @xmath25 of the stellar photosphere , so that the mean magnetic flux density of the star would be given by @xmath26 . for the sun , @xmath25 varies between about @xmath27 and @xmath28 over location and activity cycle @xcite . the local magnetic field strength @xmath29 inside a flux tube drops rapidly from @xmath10 to @xmath30 as a function of increasing height .",
    "however , for young stars in the `` saturated '' part of the age  activity ",
    "rotation diagram , @xcite and @xcite found that @xmath31 is not a bad approximation to make .",
    "we will assume this for au  mic as well ( see additional discussion in section [ sec : results ] ) , and this also allows us to assume that @xmath10 remains constant over each coronal loop .",
    "we note that @xmath25 describes the filling factor of all magnetic flux tubes , of both polarities , that pass through the stellar surface . by itself",
    ", our assumption of @xmath31 does not directly imply a prediction for the fraction of the magnetic field lines that are open ( presumably to the stellar wind ) versus those that are are closed .",
    "the open / closed fraction depends on both the overall level of gas pressure in the stellar wind and the spatial patterns of imbalance between flux tubes with positive and negative polarities @xcite .",
    "below , we do assume the entire surface is covered by loops of varying lengths , but the coronal heating  and thus the x - ray and radio / mm emission  from the longest loops is likely to be not too different from the emission from open - field regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to specify the rate of plasma heating , we use a general expression for the rate of energy flux in the cascade from large to small eddies that was derived from analytic and numerical studies of mhd turbulence .",
    "following @xcite , we define the heating rate ( in units of power generated per unit volume ) as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is a transverse correlation length for the largest driving eddies , and is typically found to be of the same order of magnitude as the radius of the flux tube ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by convention",
    ", @xmath35 is the half - length of the coronal loop .",
    "nonzero values of the exponent @xmath36 describe departures from an ideal @xcite hydrodynamic cascade ; such departures occur because of the specific mhd nature of wave - packet collisions that comprise the eddies in the presence of a strong background field . in closed loops",
    ", @xmath36 can vary between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "our expression for the dependence of @xmath36 on the wave amplitude @xmath22 and alfvn speed @xmath37 was derived from the models of @xcite .    even though equation ( [ eq : qturb ] )",
    "utilizes constant values for @xmath22 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath10 ( in the definition of @xmath37 ) , the density @xmath38 is known to decrease rapidly as a function of height in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "thus , because @xmath39 , the heating rate itself varies with density as @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 the heating rate is constant ( as was assumed by * ? ? ? * ) , and for @xmath42 the heating is stronger at the high - density footpoints .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 at the `` coronal base '' ( i.e. , just above the sharp transition region between chromosphere and corona ) are not the same as the corresponding values in the photosphere ; these quantities are computed self - consistently by the model and are not specified as inputs .    in order to determine the time - steady coronal response to a given heating rate @xmath43",
    ", we must consider how the injected heat is transported along the field by conduction and lost by radiation .",
    "we use the energy balance model of @xcite to solve for the temperature @xmath8 and electron number density @xmath44 as a function of distance along a given loop of half - length @xmath35 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "these quantities are specified by first computing the peak temperature @xmath45 at the top of the loop and the base pressure @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite parameterized the heating rate as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath46 are assumed to be constants as a function of distance . for the heating model of equation ( [ eq : qturb ] ) ,",
    "the exponents are given by @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite derived two scaling laws that allow one to solve for any two of the four loop quantities ( @xmath35 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 ) if the other two are provided . in our case , these scaling laws are given by @xmath50 and the unspecified constants of proportionality are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "these constants depend on the exponent @xmath36 , the heat conductivity coefficient @xmath51 erg @xmath52 s@xmath53 k@xmath54 , and the assumed properties of radiative cooling . for the latter",
    ", we assumed @xmath55 , with a value of @xmath56 @xmath57 s@xmath53 k@xmath58 , which we enhanced slightly over the solar value because of the higher metallicity of au  mic ( see equation 21 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in order to model the thermal state of a given loop with half - length @xmath35 , we use equation ( [ eq : qturb ] ) to determine @xmath48 in terms of the other input parameters , and we use the scaling laws given in equation ( [ eq : scale ] ) to solve for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the density at the coronal base is determined mainly by @xmath46 , but it needs to be specified initially in order to compute @xmath37 and @xmath36 in equation ( [ eq : qturb ] ) .",
    "thus , we solve for these quantities iteratively by starting with the initial guess that the density is given by @xmath9 .",
    "cycling back through the equations gives rise to a converged and self - consistent value of @xmath38 ( and thus also @xmath37 and @xmath36 ) typically within 1015 iterations , and we run it for a total of 50 iterations to ensure accuracy .",
    "this converged value of the coronal base density is often 36 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath9 , which produces typical basal @xmath44 values of @xmath59@xmath60 @xmath61 .",

    "@xcite found that the temperature dependence @xmath63 can be written as the inverse of an incomplete beta function ; we used equation ( 25 ) of @xcite to obtain @xmath63 , and then we combined it with the ideal gas equation of state to solve for @xmath64 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath63 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath8 at the coronal base was fixed at @xmath65 k.",
    "lastly , we must take account of the fact that there should be a continuous distribution of loop lengths @xmath35 across the surface of the star .",
    "we specify a normalized probability distribution @xmath66 that describes the chances of finding a loop at any given value of @xmath35 at a random location on the star .",
    "the shape of @xmath66 depends on many details about the strength and topology of the magnetic field . the large - scale magnetic geometry of m dwarfs is beginning to be understood observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we know from the sun that the x - ray and uv emission is dominated by activity on spatial scales much smaller than have been resolved so far on other stars . thus , we follow @xcite and assume a power - law probability distribution , @xmath67 , with sharp cutoffs below minimum and maximum loop lengths @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the exponent @xmath70 in the loop - length distribution is another key free parameter of this model .",
    "the shortest loops are defined geometrically as those for which the central hole in the torus shrinks to zero ; i.e. , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the modeled poloidal radius of the loop ( see section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the longest loops are assumed to have lengths of order the stellar radius .",
    "we note that some young stars may have loops that extend out to even larger heights @xcite . nonetheless , it is not known what fraction of the very longest loops remain stable and closed in the presence of a stellar wind .",
    "thus , we set @xmath73 and assume that the coronal emission is relatively insensitive to the details of what happens for the small fraction of the star covered by the longest loops .",
    "to simulate a full distribution of loops covering the surface of au  mic , we constructed 100 coronal models on a logarithmic grid in @xmath35 that spans the @xmath03.5 orders of magnitude between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we synthesized the observable quantities described below for the 100 models individually  assuming for each that the star is filled with loops of a given length ",
    "then we convolved them together using @xmath66 to produce a result that is weighted properly over the statistical distribution of loop sizes .",
    "we computed the total x - ray luminosity @xmath74 under the optically thin assumption that all radiation escapes from the emitting regions . to maintain continuity with past observations of cool - star x - rays",

    "in other words , we assumed that each loop has been `` snipped in two '' and the two ends are pointing radially upward .",
    "we also ignored foreshortening effects that would alter the path lengths through loops close to the stellar limb .    calculating",
    "the emission at radio and millimeter wavelengths was slightly more complicated than the x - ray luminosity because we can no longer assume an optically thin emitting region .",
    "thus , we solved the diffuse term in the formal solution to the equation of radiative transfer by integrating both the optical depth @xmath79 and the specific intensity @xmath80 simultaneously , with @xmath81 @xmath82 and we made the standard assumption that the source function is given by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the local planck function . because the plasma conditions vary rapidly as a function of position @xmath83 along the loop , we did _ not _ make the other standard assumption that the source function is constant over the emitting area . as above , we integrated down from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , so that the resulting optical depth increases as @xmath83 decreases .    for wavelengths @xmath84 between 0.01 and 100 cm , we assumed the radiation is dominated by thermal free - free emission ( bremsstrahlung ) and that the opacity is given by @xmath85 in cgs units ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we can also combine our model densities with the @xmath45 values given above to determine the range of gas pressures in the loops and compare them with observations .",
    "we assumed that @xmath46 remained constant over the length of each loop , and the values spanned from 760 dyne @xmath114 ( for @xmath68 ) to 1.8 dyne @xmath114 ( for @xmath69 ) .",
    "@xcite found a best fit for the uv - derived differential emission measure of au  mic to occur for a constant pressure of @xmath03 dyne @xmath114 , which falls inside the range of our modeled loops .",
    "we also computed the free - free emission at longer radio wavelengths , for which there are no firm detections of au  mic in quiescence .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite gave non - detection upper limits that we can use as further tests of our model .",
    "figure [ fig04](a ) carries over the two empirical contours from figure [ fig03 ] and also divides the parameter space into two regions : one in which the modeled emission is consistent with the @xcite upper limit for @xmath133 cm , and one in which the modeled emission exceeds that limit .",
    "our best - fitting solution sits comfortably in the region that is consistent with all of the observed radio upper limits .",
    "figure [ fig04](b ) shows representative radio and millimeter spectra for a set of seven models that fall along the observational @xmath74 contour shown in figure [ fig04](a ) .",
    "each of these models reproduces the observed x - ray luminosity of au  mic , but only one of them ( coincidentally , the one with the lowest value of @xmath22 ) agrees with the alma flux at 1.3  mm .",
    "four of these seven models have radio fluxes that fall below the @xcite and @xcite upper limits .",
    "it is noteworthy that a factor - of - two better measurement of the radio continuum at 110 cm would provide a much more stringent test of this model .",
    "the shapes of the spectra in figure [ fig04](b ) convey interesting information about the spatial variations in temperature and density .",
    "at the lowest wavelengths , the optical depth @xmath79 is small ( even when integrating all the way down to the coronal base ) , so the @xmath134 dependence of the source function cancels out with the @xmath135 in the opacity .",
    "thus , the spectrum has a canonically flat shape that reflects only the slow wavelength dependence of the gaunt factor .",
    "as the wavelength increases , the optical depth at the coronal base gets larger , and more of the coronal loops become optically thick . in that limit ,",
    "the intensity is capped at a maximum value of @xmath136 if the temperature in the emitting region was a constant , this would give a power - law spectrum going as @xmath137 .",
    "a steepening to this shape is indeed seen around @xmath1385 cm , but then it flattens out again .",
    "this is because the optical depth keeps increasing as @xmath84 increases , and the level of the @xmath139 `` radio photosphere '' moves up from the coronal base to the tops of the loops . because @xmath63 increases from the base to the loop - tops ,",
    "the emitting temperature to be used in equation ( [ eq : thick ] ) is an increasing function of @xmath84 , too .",
    "this gives rise to an absolute value of @xmath80 that grows progressively larger than it would have been had the emitting temperature remained constant .",
    "presumably as @xmath84 is increased even further , all of the loop tops will become optically thick , the emergent free - free emission will be dominated only by @xmath45 , and the spectrum will start declining again as @xmath137 .",
    "lastly , we mention that the resulting values of x - ray and radio / mm emissivity do depend on the assumed value of the photospheric magnetic filling factor @xmath25 .",
    "we ran a series of models for the standard parameter choices of @xmath127 km s@xmath53 and @xmath128 , where @xmath25 was varied over two orders of magnitude from 0.01 to 1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity scales roughly as @xmath140 , and the free - free emission flux at @xmath3 mm scales as @xmath141 .",
    "these order - unity power law exponents imply that the uncertainties in the coronal loop parameters determined above may be roughly of the same magnitude as the uncertainty in our knowledge of @xmath25 for this star .",
    "in this paper we began the process of exploring whether a physically motivated model of coronal loop heating could reproduce the observed properties of au  mic .",
    "we adapted an existing model of mhd turbulent dissipation to the environment of an m1 dwarf star and treated the surface velocity amplitude @xmath22 of stochastic alfvnic motions as a free parameter . for a value of @xmath142 km s@xmath53 ( which is consistent with the expected granular microturbulence velocity ) and a power - law probability distribution of loop lengths @xmath35 that goes roughly as @xmath143",
    ", the model successfully predicts the observed x - ray luminosity and millimeter - wave emission peak .",
    "the model is also consistent with radio upper limits measured at quiescent ( non - flaring ) time periods for au  mic .",
    "it may be possible to use independent estimates of the stellar wind mass loss rate of au  mic to say more about the verisimilitude of the coronal heating model .",
    "@xcite determined that a mass loss rate of order @xmath144 @xmath97 yr@xmath53 for au  mic would generate sufficient pressure to transport dust to the outermost parts of its observed disk .",
    "we used the stellar wind model presented by @xcite to compute how the mass loss rate of au  mic depends on the assumed value of @xmath22 in the treatment of coronal heating .",
    "the `` default '' value of @xmath145 km s@xmath53 obtained from the convective turbulence model of @xcite gives rise to a mass loss rate of only @xmath146 yr@xmath53 .",
    "however , if we increase @xmath22 to the empirically determined value of 1.5545 km s@xmath53 ( see white circles in figures [ fig03][fig04 ] ) , the @xcite mass loss rate increases to @xmath147 yr@xmath53 .",
    "this is close to the value required by @xcite to explain the outer disk s dust diffusion .",
    "it is at least circumstantial evidence that our loop model , `` calibrated '' with @xmath142 km s@xmath53 , reflects what is actually going on in the outer atmosphere of au  mic .",
    "although our model accurately reproduces the magnitude of the alma 1.3  mm central emission peak , we do not yet have a definitive way to distinguish between this model and the idea of an inner asteroid belt proposed by @xcite .",
    "for example , neither model predicts significant mid - infrared excess centered on the star , and indeed none is seen for au  mic @xcite .",
    "it is possible , of course , that au  mic has _ both _ an active stellar corona and a bright inner source of dusty debris .",
    "additional information about the spectral energy distribution of the central peak resolved by alma would be extremely helpful to putting limits on the relative contributions of these two suggested explanations for the 1.3  mm emission .",
    "also , better observational limits on the spatial extent of the central peak would be helpful , since the dust belt is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger in size than the source of coronal emission .",
    "in addition to better observational constraints , there are also several ways that the models can be improved .",
    "we limited ourselves to just the time - steady component of coronal heating and not the more intermittent flaring , but the latter is known to be a non - negligible component of the total x - ray @xcite and ultraviolet @xcite emission . because we did not model flares , we also ignored the potential contributions of nonthermal electrons and gyromagnetic emission to the radio and millimeter spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we did not simulate the full three - dimensional magnetic geometry of the corona of au  mic ; instead we treated its topological complexity using a simple statistical distribution of loop sizes .",
    "future refinements to our predictions of radio , millimeter , and x - ray emission from stellar coronae should include improvements to each of the above approximations .",
    "finally , the success of any ab  initio coronal model depends on our understanding of magnetic dynamos in low - mass stars .",
    "young , rapidly rotating stars are suspected of having more vigorous convective motions and more frequent magnetic flux emergence than older stars such as the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the turbulent convection models we have used so far @xcite do not yet include these effects , but our semi - empirical determination of @xmath142 km s@xmath53 may help put limits on how active the surfaces of young stars actually are .",
    "still , we do not know what the granulation pattern  and the distribution of magnetic flux tubes  really looks like on the surface of a saturated - activity star .",
    "it is also possible that rapid rotation strongly affects the distribution of loop lengths @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs such as au  mic are also close to the dividing line between having a radiative core and being fully convective .",
    "the qualitative properties of rotation , dynamos , and large - scale magnetic fields are believed to change substantially across this dividing line @xcite .",
    "these `` hidden '' aspects of stellar interiors may have significant impacts on the high - energy activity of a star like au  mic and its surrounding dust and debris .",
