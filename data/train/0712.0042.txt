    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna technology has emerged as an effective technique for significantly improving the capacity of wireless communication systems .",
    "a great deal of work has been done on analyzing the mimo capacity in various flat - fading channel scenarios , since the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite . in particular , the mean ( ergodic ) capacity has now been comprehensively investigated ( e.g.  see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the outage capacity has also been investigated for flat - fading channels .",
    "this is an important capacity measure for systems with stringent delay constraints , and also provides information about the system diversity @xcite . with the exception of the exact two / three antenna results presented in @xcite",
    ", outage capacity analysis has typically involved approximating the distribution of the mutual information , since exact closed - form solutions are not forthcoming .",
    "it has been shown that the gaussian distribution provides a good approximation in many cases @xcite .    .mimo - ofdm presence in standards [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this paper , we consider frequency - selective mimo channels , which are applicable for many current high data - rate wireless systems .",
    "we focus on mimo orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) systems , since they form the underlying technology for a many emerging mimo standards , as summarized in table [ table_1 ] , and consider spatial multiplexing transmission . despite their key practical significance however , for these systems ( and indeed frequency - selective mimo channels in general ) there are relatively few analytic mimo capacity results .",
    "the ergodic capacity ( average mutual information ) was considered in @xcite and @xcite , assuming rayleigh and rician channels respectively , and was found to be easily obtained by summing the equivalent flat - fading ergodic mimo capacity of each individual ofdm subcarrier .",
    "in contrast , the outage capacity does not decompose in this way .",
    "calculating the outage capacity for frequency - selective channels is difficult due to the non - negligible correlations between subcarrier channel matrices .",
    "as such , the investigation of outage capacity has usually been performed using simulation studies @xcite .",
    "it appears that the only current analytical outage capacity results for frequency - selective channels are presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , all of which derive a gaussian approximation for the mutual information distribution .",
    "the results in @xcite however , are based on deriving exact expressions for the mutual information variance of single - input single - output ( siso ) channels only ; whereas the results in @xcite and @xcite are based on approximating the mutual information variance using asymptotic methods .",
    "specifically , @xcite considers multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channels with asymptotically large channel lengths , whereas @xcite considers mimo channels with infinite numbers of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "we note also that for the extreme frequency - selective fading case , ie .  where the mimo subcarrier matrices are independent across frequency , the variance of the mutual information could be easily calculated by adapting known mimo flat - fading variance results given , for example , in @xcite and @xcite . for many practical systems however , the subcarrier channels are typically highly correlated across frequency , and this approach can not be applied .    in this paper , we consider mimo ofdm - based spatial multiplexing systems with finite numbers of antennas , and operating over spatially - uncorrelated rayleigh fading channels with finite delay spreads .",
    "we first derive new exact closed - form expressions for the mutual information variance .",
    "we also give explicit reduced formulas for the specific cases of multiple - input single - output ( miso ) , single - input multiple - output ( simo ) , and single - input single - output ( siso ) systems .",
    "moreover , simplified closed - form expressions are derived for the variance in the high and low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regimes .    based on the new analytic variance results ( along with known analytic mean results ) , we then present new approximations to the mutual information distribution of ofdm - based spatial multiplexing systems .",
    "in particular , we present a new closed - form gaussian approximation , which is shown to be extremely accurate for many different system and channel scenarios . in the low snr regime",
    ", we also present a new analytic gamma approximation , which we show to be more accurate than the gaussian approximation in this case .",
    "finally , we use the analytic gaussian approximation to estimate the outage capacity .",
    "we find that the approximation is very accurate , and show that for outage levels of practical interest , the outage capacity depends heavily on the delay spread of the channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the frequency - selective mimo channel model , the ofdm - based spatial multiplexing signal model , and the associated mutual information . in section iii , we present the main analytical contributions of the paper , namely , analytical expressions for the variance of the mutual information .",

    "these matrices are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated , and are assumed to be known perfectly at the receiver but are unknown at the transmitter .. the channel is assumed to be quasi - static , remaining constant for the duration of a codeword , but changing independently from codeword to codeword . throughout the paper , we assume that the channel elements exhibit spatially - uncorrelated rayleigh fading , in which case each @xmath26 $ ] contains independent elements @xmath28 .    at the transmitter , the time - domain input sequence @xmath17 $ ] is generated as @xmath12 parallel ofdm symbols .",

    ", ofdm demodulation is performed at each receive antenna using an @xmath14-point fft .",
    "a key advantage of ofdm - based spatial multiplexing is that equalization is simple , since the frequency - selective mimo channel is transformed into @xmath14 orthogonal flat - fading mimo subchannels via the ifft / fft processing .    to maintain orthogonality in the presence of intersymbol interference caused by multipath",
    ", ofdm systems typically employ a cyclic prefix extension . assuming that the cyclic prefix is longer than the delay spread of the channel , we can write the equivalent frequency domain input - output model for ofdm - based spatial multiplexing as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the transmitted vector for the @xmath31th subcarrier , assumed to be i.i.d .  gaussian with covariance matrix @xmath32 = \\frac{\\gamma}{n_t } \\mathbf{i}_{n_t } $ ]",

    "note that due to the finite - length impulse response , correlation exists between different subcarrier channel matrices . using ( [ eq : ofdm_channel_mat ] ) , the correlation coefficients between the channel elements on two arbitrary subcarriers @xmath31 and @xmath40 is easily derived as follows ( see also @xcite ) @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\ & =   \\sum_{p = 0}^{l-1 } \\sigma_p^2 \\ ; e^{-j 2 \\pi ( k-\\ell ) p / n } \\delta[i - i ' ] \\delta[j - j']\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath42 .",
    "as expected , these frequency correlation coefficients depend only on the difference between subcarriers ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) , and not on the subcarriers themselves .    note that with the above model , the snr per receive antenna per subcarrier ( henceforth referred to as ` the snr ' ) is given by @xmath44 .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the statistics of the mutual information of ofdm - based spatial multiplexing systems .",

    "_ proof : _ from ( [ eq : freqcorrcoef ] ) , we see that @xmath217 and @xmath218 are ( frequency ) _ correlated wishart matrices_. in @xcite , the joint ordered eigenvalue density for matrices of this general form was evaluated for cases where the correlation coefficient was real . extending this result to complex correlation coefficients , and to unordered eigenvalues , we obtain the joint eigenvalue density @xmath219 is a vandermonde determinant , defined as @xmath220 note that the extension from ordered to unordered eigenvalues simply involved the addition of the leading @xmath221 factor in ( [ eq : unorderedjointpdf ] ) , whereas the extension from real to complex correlation coefficients is trivial , and the proof is omitted .    to evaluate ( [ eq : arbunorderedpdf ] ) we marginalize ( [ eq : unorderedjointpdf ] ) as follows @xmath222 where we have let @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
