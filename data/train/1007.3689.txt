    "this obvious deviation triggered already considerable interest in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations obtained values below @xmath0 but still considerably above the measured values .",
    "e.g. in the classical work of lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite optimal release angles of about @xmath2 were found by including the effect of the height of an athlete . + we start by redoing the analysis of lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "next we investigate the effect of air resistance . here",
    "we find as expected @xcite that in the case of shot put air resistance gives a negligible contribution instead of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 diameter , @xmath8 radius ) and have therefore a force that is four times as large as the correct one . ] .",
    "if the initial velocity @xmath9 , the release height @xmath10 and the release angle @xmath11 are known , the results obtained up to that point are exact .",
    "we provide a computer program to determine graphically the trajectory of the shot for a given set of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 including air resistance and wind .",
    "+ coming back to the question of the optimal angle of release we give up the assumption of lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite , that the initial velocity , the release height and the release angle are uncorrelated .",
    "this was suggested earlier in the literature @xcite .",
    "we include three correlations :    * the angle dependence of the release height ; this was discussed in detail by de luca ( 2005 ) @xcite .",
    "* the angle dependence of the force of the athlete ; this was suggested for javeline throw by red and zogaib ( 1977 ) @xcite . in particular a inverse proportionality between the initial velocity and the angle of release was found .",
    "this effect was discussed for the case of shot put in mcwatt ( 1982)@xcite , mccoy ( 1984)@xcite , gregor ( 1990)@xcite and linthorne ( 2001)@xcite . *",
    "the angle dependence of the initial velocity due to the effect of gravity during the period of release ; this was discussed e.g. in tricker and tricker ( 1967 ) @xcite , zatsiorski and matveev ( 1969 ) @xcite , hay ( 1973 ) @xcite and linthorne ( 2001)@xcite .    to include these three correlations",
    "we still need information about the angle dependence of the force of the athlete . in principle",
    "this has to be obtained by measurements with each invididual athlete . to show the validity of our approach we use a simple model for the angle dependence of the force and obtain realistic values for the optimal angle of release . + our strategy is in parts similar to the nice and extensive work of linthorne ( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "while linthorne s approach is based on experimental data on @xmath12 and @xmath13 our approach is more theoretical .",
    "we present some toy models that predict the relation @xmath14 found by red and zogaib ( 1977 ) @xcite .",
    "+ we do not discuss possible deviations between the flight distance of the shot and the official distance . here",
    "were refer the interested reader to the work of linthorne ( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "let us start with the simplest model for shot put .",
    "the shot is released from a horizontal plane with an initial velocity @xmath9 under the angle @xmath11 relative to the plane .",
    "we denote the horizontal distance with @xmath15 and the vertical distance with @xmath16 . the maximal height of the shot is denoted by @xmath17 ; the shot lands again on the plane after travelling the horizontal distance @xmath18 , see fig.[fig1 ] .    solving the equations of motions @xmath19 with the initial condition @xmath20 one obtains @xmath21 the maximal horizontal distance is obtained by setting @xmath22 equal to zero @xmath23 from this result",
    "we can read off that the optimal angle is @xmath24 - this is the result that is obtained in many undergraduate textbooks .",
    "it is however considerably above the measured values of top athletes .",
    "moreover , eq.([xm0 ] ) shows that the maximal range at shot put depends quadratically on the initial velocity of the shot .",
    "next we take the height of the athlete into account , this was described first in lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) still holds for that case .",
    "we denote the height at which the shot is released with @xmath10 .",
    "the maximal horizontal distance is now obtained by setting @xmath22 equal to @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 this equation holds exactly if the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known and if the air resistance is neglected . + assuming that the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent of each other we can determine the optimal angle of release by setting the derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath11 to zero . @xmath28 the optimal angle is now always smaller than @xmath0 . with increasing @xmath10 the optimal angle is getting smaller , therefore taller athletes have to release the shot more flat .",
    "the dependence on the initial velocity @xmath27 is more complicated .",
    "larger values of @xmath27 favor larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "we show the optimal angle for three fixed values of @xmath29 m , @xmath30 m and @xmath31 m in dependence of @xmath27 in fig.[fig2 ] .    with the average values from table [ tab1 ] for @xmath32 m and @xmath33",
    "m / s we obtain an optimal angle of @xmath34 , while the average of the measured angles from table [ tab1 ] is about @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude therefore that the effect of including the height of the athlete goes in the right direction , but the final values for the optimal angle are still larger than the measured ones . in our example",
    "the initial discrepancy between theory and measurement of @xmath35 is reduced to @xmath36 .",
    "these findings coincide with the ones from lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "+ for @xmath37 m and @xmath38 m / s ( @xmath39 ) we can also expand the expression for the optimal angle @xmath40                     =   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{4 } \\frac{e_{pot}}{e_{kin } }                     + { \\cal o } \\left ( \\frac{hg}{v_0 ^ 2 } \\right)^2 \\right ] \\ , , \\ ] ] with the kinetic energy @xmath41 and the potential energy @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 denotes the mass of the shot . + by eliminating different variables from the problem , lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite derived several expressions for the maximum range at shot put :",
    "@xmath44 expanding the expression in eq.([xmthel ] ) in @xmath45 one gets @xmath46 here we can make several interesting conclusions    * to zeroth order in @xmath45 the maximal horizontal distance is simply given by @xmath47 .",
    "this can also be read off from eq .",
    "( [ xm0 ] ) with @xmath48 . *",
    "to first order in @xmath45 the maximal horizontal distance is @xmath49 . releasing the shot from 10 cm more height results in a 10 cm longer horizontal distance . *",
    "the kinetic energy is two times more important than the potential energy .",
    "if an athlete has the additional energy @xmath50 at his disposal , it would be advantageous to put the complete amount @xmath50 in kinetic energy compared to potential energy .",
    "* effects of small deviations from the optimal angle are not large , since @xmath18 is stationary at the optimal angle .",
    "next we investigate the effect of the air resistance .",
    "this was considered in tutevich ( 1969 ) @xcite , lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of the air resistance is described by the following force @xmath51 with the density of air @xmath52 , the drag coefficient of the sphere @xmath53 ( about @xmath54 ) , the radius of the sphere @xmath8 and the velocity of the shot @xmath55 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath27 in our calculations is about @xmath56 m / s which results in very small accelerations @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to the air resistance we included the wind velocity in our calculations . + we confirm the results of tutevich ( 1969 ) @xcite .",
    "as expected the effect of the air resistance turns out to be very small .",
    "tutevich stated that for headwind with a velocity of @xmath58 m / s the shot is about @xmath59 cm reduced for @xmath60 m / s compared to the value of @xmath18 without wind .",
    "he also stated that for tailwind one will find an increased value of @xmath61 cm at @xmath60 m / s compared to a windless environment .",
    "we could verify the calculations of tutevich ( 1969 ) @xcite and obtain some additional information as listed in table [ tab2 ] by incorporating these effects in a small computer program that can be downloaded from the internet , see rappl ( 2010)@xcite . an interesting fact is that headwind reduces the shot more than direct wind from above ( which could be seen as small @xmath62 factor corrections ) .",
    "if the values of @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known ( measured ) precisely then the results of our program are exact .",
    "+ now one can try to find again the optimal angle of release .",
    "lichtenberg and wills ( 1978 ) @xcite find that the optimal angle is reduced compared to our previous determination by about @xmath63 for some typical values of @xmath27 and @xmath10 and by still assuming that @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent of each other .",
    "+ due to the smallness of this effect compared to the remaining discrepancy of about @xmath64 between the predicted optimal angle of release and the measurements we neglect air resistance in the following .",
    "next we give up the assumption that the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath27 and @xmath10 are independent variables .",
    "this was suggested e.g. in tricker and tricker ( 1967 ) @xcite , hay ( 1973 ) @xcite , dyson ( 1986 ) @xcite , hubbard ( 1988 ) @xcite , de mestre ( 1990 ) @xcite , de mestre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xcite , maheras ( 1998 ) @xcite , yeadon ( 1998 ) @xcite , linthorne ( 2001 ) @xcite and de luca ( 2005 ) @xcite .",
    "we will include three effects : the dependence of the height of release from the angle of release , the angle dependence of the force of the athlete and the effect of gravity during the delivery phase .",
    "the height of the point , where the shot is released depends obviously on the arm length and on the angle @xmath65 with the height of the shoulder @xmath66 and the length of the arm @xmath67 .",
    "clearly this effect will tend to enhance the value of the optimal angle of release , since a larger angle will give a larger value of @xmath10 and this will result in a larger value of @xmath18 .",
    "this effect was studied in detail e.g. in de luca ( 2005)@xcite .",
    "we redid that analysis and confirm the main result of that work .",
    "should have a different sign . ]",
    "the optimal angle can be expanded in @xmath68 @xmath69 as expected above we can read off from this formula that the optimal angle of release is now enhanced compared to the analysis of lichtenberg and wills ( 1976 ) , @xmath70 for typical values of @xmath27 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 de luca ( 2005)@xcite gets an increase of the optimal angle of release in the range of @xmath71 to @xmath72 . with the inclusion of this effect",
    "the problem of predicting the optimal angle of release has become even more severe .",
    "the world records in bench - pressing are considerably higher than the world records in clean and jerk .",
    "this hints to the fact that athletes have typically most power at the angle @xmath73 compared to larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "this effect that is also confirmed by experience in weight training , was suggested and investigated e.g. by mcwatt ( 1982)@xcite , mccoy ( 1984)@xcite , gregor ( 1990)@xcite and linthorne ( 2001)@xcite . the angle dependence of the force of the athlete can be measured and then be used as an input in the theoretical investigation . below we will use a very simple model for the dependence to explain the consequences .",
    "this effect now tends to favor smaller values for the optimal angle of release .",
    "finally one has to take into account the fact , that the energy the athlete can produce is split up in potential energy and in kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the higher the athlete throws the lower will be the velocity of the shot .",
    "since the achieved distance at shot put depends stronger on @xmath27 than on @xmath10 this effect will also tend to giver smaller values for the optimal angle of release .",
    "this was investigated e.g. in tricker and tricker ( 1967 ) @xcite , zatsiorski and matveev ( 1969 ) @xcite , hay ( 1973 ) @xcite and linthorne ( 2001)@xcite .",
    "now we put all effects together . from eq.([arm ] ) and eq.([energy ] ) we get @xmath76 the angle dependence of the force of the athlete will result in an angle dependence of the energy an athlete is able to transmit to the put @xmath77 the function @xmath78 can in principle be determined by measurements with individual athletes . from these two equations and from eq.([arm ] ) we get @xmath79 , \\label{v0th } \\\\",

    "we need to know @xmath78 . in principle",
    "this function is different for different athletes and it can be determined from measurements with the athlete . to make some general statements we present two simple toy models for @xmath82 .",
    "we use the following two simple toy models for @xmath78 @xmath83 this choice results in @xmath84 for @xmath73 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 , which looks reasonable . at this stage",
    "we want to remind the reader again : this ansatz is just supposed to be a toy model , a decisive analysis of the optimal angle of release will have to be done with the measured values for @xmath78 .",
    "we extract the normalization @xmath87 from measurements @xmath88 , \\\\ \\frac{e_{2,0}}{m } & = & \\frac{e_2(\\theta)}{m f_2(\\theta ) }                 = \\frac{1}{1- \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{\\theta}{\\pi } } \\left [ g b \\sin \\theta + \\frac{v_0 ^ 2}{2 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the average values of table [ tab1 ] ( @xmath89 m , @xmath90 m / s and @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 m we get @xmath93 now all parameters in @xmath81 are known .",
    "looking for the maximum of @xmath94 we obtain the optimal angle of release to be @xmath95 which lie now perfectly in the measured range ! + next we can also test the findings of maheras ( 1998)@xcite that @xmath27 decreases linearly with @xmath11 by plotting @xmath96 from eq.([v0th ] ) against @xmath11 .",
    "we find our toy model 1 gives an almost linear decrease , while the decrease of toy model looks exactly linear .",
    "+ our simple but reasonable toy models for the angle dependence of the force of the athlete give us values for optimal release angle of about @xmath97 , which coincide perfectly with the measured values .",

    "standard text - book wisdom tells us that the optimal angle is @xmath24 , while measurements of top athletes tend to give values around @xmath98 .",
    "including the effect of the height of the athlete reduces the theory prediction for the optimal angle to values of about @xmath2 ( lichtenberg and wills ( 1978 ) @xcite ) . as the next step",
    "we take the correlation between the initial velocity @xmath9 , the height of release @xmath10 and the angle of release @xmath11 into account .",
    "therefore we include three effects :    1 .",
    "the dependence of the height of release from the angle of release is a simple geometrical relation .",
