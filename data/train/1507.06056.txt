    "ab jafar muhammad al - khwrizm , a persian astronomer and mathematician , wrote a treatise in 825 ad , _ kitb hisb al - adad al - ind _ ( _ book on calculation with hindu numerals _ ) , which was translated into latin in the early 12th century as _ liber algorismi de numero indorum _",
    "( _ the book of algorismi on indian numerals _ ) . the word `` algorism'' the latin form of al - khwrizm s name  came to be applied to any systematic work on ancient indian - style computational mathematics .",
    "the present term `` algorithm '' is a distorted form of `` algorism '' @xcite .",
    "the field of algorithms , which is at the very heart of computer science , has witnessed a number of significant advances during the last five decades .",
    "these advances include the development of faster algorithms and the discovery of certain natural problems for which all known algorithms are inefficient @xcite .",
    "these startling results have kindled a keen interest in the area of algorithm design and analysis .",
    "teaching and research in this foundational aspect of computing is therefore a natural and desirable thrust area .    as algorithms are also at the heart of every nontrivial computer application , computer scientists and professional programmers are expected to know about the basic algorithmic toolbox",
    ": structures that allow efficient organization and retrieval of data , frequently used algorithms and generic techniques for modeling , understanding and solving algorithmic problems .",
    "hence , algorithmic studies form a major component of computer science programs in colleges and universities .    in the last four decades ,",
    "graph and geometric problems have been studied by computer science researchers using the framework of design and analysis of algorithms @xcite . while graph algorithms have been studied for almost 300 years",
    ", graphs provide essential models for many application areas of computer science , and at the same time , they are fascinating objects of study in pure and applied mathematics . there have been a number of exciting developments in graph theory that are important for designers of algorithms .",
    "correspondingly , the algorithmic viewpoint of computer science has stimulated much research in graph theory .",
    "graph theory and graph algorithms are inseparably intertwined subjects .",
    "on the other hand , the main impetus for the development of geometric algorithms came from the progress in computer graphics , computer - aided design and manufacturing @xcite .",
    "in addition , algorithms are also designed for geometric problems that are classical in nature .",
    "the success of the field can be explained from the beauty of the geometry problems studied , the solutions obtained , and by the many application domains  computer graphics , geographic information systems , robotics and others , in which geometric algorithms play a crucial role .",
    "we know that basic algorithmic research has helped building today s computer technology and will keep on playing a crucial role in the achievement of tomorrow s technological breakthroughs .",
    "therefore , we believe that algorithmic research is certainly important even for india .    at present , research is being carried out in india in several sub - areas of algorithms and results are being published in reputed conferences and journals in computer science and discrete applied mathematics .",
    "algorithmic research started in india in premier academic institutes like tifr , iits and iisc , way back in the 70 s . in recent years , algorithmic research",
    "is also carried out in computer industries in india including microsoft research , ibm research , tcs innovation labs , etc . today",
    ", computer industries in india provide financial support to projects on algorithmic research in indian academic institutes and also provide fellowships to ph.d .",
    "students working in algorithmic research .    the need for algorithmic research in india was felt in the late 70 s .",
    "perceiving future needs , the course  design and analysis of algorithms \" was introduced in the 80 s in the undergraduate and postgraduate levels as a core course in premier institutes like iit s , tifr and iisc .",
    "this course used to cover asymptotic analysis of running time and space requirements for quantitatively measuring the efficiency of algorithms , searching and sorting algorithms , data structures , sequential algorithms for graph and geometric problems , np - completeness , etc .    designing efficient algorithms for graph and geometric problems within the framework of",
    "the design and analysis of algorithms started also around the same time .",
    "there were a few researchers in india ( including s. n. maheshwari ( iit delhi ) , c. e. veni madhavan ( iisc bangalore ) , subir ghosh ( tifr mumbai ) ) , who were involved in algorithmic research during that time .",
    "in the 90 s , ph.d .",
    "and master theses on algorithms for graph and geometric problems started coming up in increasing numbers , demonstrating the acceptability of algorithmic research in india .",
    "many of these theses for designing efficient algorithms used mathematical techniques from combinatorics , probability theory , graph theory , etc . , and",
    "algorithmic techniques like greedy methods , divide and conquer , approximations , randomization , etc .    on the other hand , after personal computers became more and more available in india in the late 80 s , a large number of scientists , engineers and administrators in india across all disciplines started using personal computers for solving problems arising in research , applications and in commerce .",
    "this gave rise to the need of computer programmers , as the it industries proliferated .",
    "naturally , several softwares were designed in 80 s and 90 s and many of them used basic algorithmic techniques and data structures that were routinely taught in the courses of  design and analysis of algorithms \" not only in iits , iisc and tifr but also in nits , bits pilani , and several universities in india .",
    "algorithmic studies gained further impetus in the 90 s in india like anywhere in the world after personal computers became connected through networks , forming the world wide web .",
    "new types of algorithms like streaming algorithms , web - based algorithms , network algorithms , distributed algorithms , big data algorithms , etc . came into play in the last two decades .    though the number of researchers working in india on graph and geometric algorithms has increased substantially in the last two decades , the number of active researchers in algorithms is still far lesser in india compared to the large number of bright students and teachers involved in studying and teaching computer science and discrete applied mathematics . in order to motivate them towards computer science research in general and algorithmic research in particular , twenty - two workshops of introductory lectures on graph and geometric algorithms",
