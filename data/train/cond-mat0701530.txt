    "the importance of flux - line pinning in preserving the superconductivity in a magnetic field has been generally recognized since the discovery of type - ii superconductivity . but",
    "till now the mechanism of flux - line pinning and creep in superconductors ( and particularly in the high-_@xmath0 _ superconductors ( htsc s ) ) is still a matter of controversy and great current interest , especially in the cases of strong competition between different types of pins .",
    "one of the open issues in the field is the influence of _ isotropic _ point - like disorder on the vortex dynamics in the _ anisotropic _ washboard planar pinning potential ( ppp ) for the case of arbitrary orientation of the transport current with respect to the ppp `` channels '' where the _ guiding of vortices _ can be realized .",
    "the importance of this issue may be substantiated by ubiquitous presence of point - like pins in those high- and low-_@xmath0 _ superconductors which were used so far for resistive measurements of the guided vortex motion@xmath1 .",
    "the first attempt to discuss the influence of isotropic point - like disorder on the guiding of vortices was made by niessen and weijsenfeld@xmath2 still in 1969 .",
    "they studied guided motion _ in the flux flow regime _ by measuring transverse voltages of cold - rolled sheets of a nb - ta alloy for different magnetic fields _ h _ , transport current densities _ j _ , temperatures _",
    "t _ , and different angles @xmath3 between the rolling and current direction .",
    "the ( _ h , j , t_,@xmath3)-dependences of the cotangent of the angle @xmath4 between the average vortex velocity @xmath5 and the vector * j * direction were presented . for the discussion , a simple theoretical model was suggested , based on the assumption that vortex pinning and guiding can be described in terms of an isotropic pinning force @xmath6 plus a pinning force @xmath7 with a fixed direction which was perpendicular to the rolling direction . the experimentally observed dependence of the transverse and longitudinal voltages on the magnetic field _ in the flux flow regime _ as a function of the angle @xmath3 was in agreement with this model .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of the correct description of a geometry of the motive forces of a problem ( see below fig .",
    "1 ) it was impossible within the flux flow approach@xmath2 to calculate theoretically the _ nonlinear _ ( _ j ,  t _ , @xmath3)-dependences of the average pinning forces @xmath8 and @xmath9 which determine the experimentally observed cot@xmath10 dependences .",
    "the _ nonlinear guiding _ problem was exactly solved at first only for the washboard ppp ( i.e. for @xmath11 ) within the framework of the two - dimensional single - vortex stochastic model of anisotropic pinning based on the fokker - planck equation with a concrete form of the pinning potential@xmath12 .",
    "two main reasons stimulated these theoretical studies .",
    "first , in some htcs s twins can easily be formed during the crystal growth@xmath13 .",
    "second , in layered htcs s the system of interlayers between parallel _ ab_-planes can be considered as a set of unidirectional planar defects which provoke the intrinsic pinning of vortices@xmath14 .",
    "rather simple formulas were derived@xmath15 for the experimentally observable _ nonlinear _ even@xmath16 and odd@xmath17 ( with respect to the magnetic field reversal ) longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistivities @xmath18 as functions of the dimensionless transport current density @xmath19 dimensionless temperature @xmath20 and relative volume fraction @xmath21 occupied by the parallel twin planes directed at an angle @xmath3 with respect to the current direction .",
    "the @xmath22-formulas were presented as linear combinations of the even and odd parts of the function @xmath23 which can be considered as the probability of overcoming the potential barrier of the twins@xmath15 ; this made it possible to give a simple physical treatment of the nonlinear regimes of vortex motion ( see below item ii.c ) .",
    "besides the appearance of a relatively large even transverse @xmath24 resistivity , generated by the guiding of vortices along the channels of the washboard ppp , explicit expressions for _ two new nonlinear anisotropic hall resistivities _ @xmath25 _ and _ @xmath26 were derived and analyzed .",
    "the physical origin of these _ odd _ contributions caused by the subtle interplay between even effect of vortex guiding and the odd hall effect .",
    "both new resistivities were going to zero in the linear regimes of the vortex motion ( i.e. in the thermoactivated flux flow ( taff ) and the ohmic flux flow ( ff ) regimes ) and had a bump - like current or temperature dependence in the vicinity of highly nonlinear resistive transition from the taff to the ff .",
    "as the new odd resistivities arose due to the hall effect , their characteristic scale was proportional to the small hall constant as for ordinary odd hall effect investigated earlier@xmath27 .",
    "it was shown@xmath15 that appearance of these new odd @xmath28 contributions leads to the new specific angle - dependent `` scaling '' relations for the ppp which demonstrate the so - called anomalous hall behavior in the type - ii superconductors .",
    "here we should to emphasize that the anomalous behavior of the hall effect in many high - temperature and in some conventional superconductors in the mixed state remains one of the challenging issues in the vortex dynamics@xmath29 .",
    "the problem at issues includes several remarkable experimental facts : a ) the hall effect sign reversal in the vortex state with respect to the normal state at temperatures near @xmath30 and for moderate magnetic fields ; b ) the hall resistivity `` scaling '' relation @xmath31 exists with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hall resistivity and @xmath34 is the longitudinal resistivity ; c ) the influence of pinning on the `` hall anomaly '' and scaling relation . assuming that the `` bare '' hall coefficient @xmath35 is constant , two different scaling laws have been derived earlier theoretically for different pinning potentials@xmath36 .",
    "vinokur et al .",
    "have shown@xmath37 that a scaling law @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the hall conductivity , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the speed of light , @xmath42 is the magnetic field and @xmath43 is the magnetic flux quantum ) is the general feature of any isotropic vortex dynamics with an average pinning force directed along the average vortex velocity vector .",
    "later it was shown@xmath15 that for purely anisotropic _",
    "a_-pins that create a washboard planar pinning potential , the form of corresponding `` scaling '' relation is highly anisotropic due to the reason that pinning force for _",
    "a_-pins is directed perpendicular to the pinning planes .",
    "if @xmath3 is the angle between parallel pinning planes and direction of the current density vector @xmath44 , then for @xmath45 the scaling law has the form @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the vortex viscosity ) which was interpreted previously@xmath15 as a scaling law with @xmath48 , whereas for @xmath49 the scaling relation is more complex@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath50 , as it is shown in this paper , can be presented as a sum of the three contributions with the different signs . the graphical analysis in sec .",
    "iii of this paper represents a some range of the @xmath51-values where the theory predicts a nonlinear change of the @xmath50 sign .",
    "let us consider another specific feature of the purely anisotropic guiding model@xmath12 . from the mathematical viewpoint , the nonlinear anisotropic problem , as solved in ref .",
    "11 , reduces to the fokker - planck equation of the one - dimensional vortex dynamics@xmath52 because the vortex motion is unpinned in the direction which is parallel to the ppp channels . as a consequence , a critical current @xmath53 exists only for the direction which is strictly perpendicular to the ppp channels ( @xmath45 ) ; @xmath54 for any other direction ( @xmath55 )",
    "however , the measurements of the magnetoresistivity show@xmath56 that @xmath57 for all @xmath3 ( although @xmath58 may be anisotropic ) .",
    "so , in spite of some merits of a model with a washboard ppp , which was the first exactly solvable stochastic nonlinear model of anisotropic pinning , it can not describe the @xmath53-anisotropy of the experimentally measured samples .",
    "due to this reason later it was suggested@xmath59 another simple model , which demonstrates this @xmath53-anisotropy for all @xmath3 on the basis of the bianisotropic pinning potential formed by the sum of two washboard ppp s in two mutually perpendicular directions .",
    "in contradistinction to the nonlinear model with uniaxial ppp@xmath15 , this bianisotropic nonlinear model predicts a @xmath58-anisotropy and relates it to the guiding anisotropy , describing the appearance of two step - like and two bump - like singularities in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( hall ) resistive responses , respectively .",
    "although several proposals to realize experimentally this bianisotropic model were discussed so far@xmath62 , the corresponding experiments , however , are still absent .    at the same time , the experimental study of vortex dynamics in the ppp is always accompanied with a presence of a certain level of point - like disorder .",
    "so , as far as the analysis of existing experimental data is concerned , none of the present theoretical studies in the limiting cases of purely anisotropic or isotropic pinning are sufficient .",
    "the more general approach is needed .",
    "the objective of this paper is to present results of a theory for the calculation of the nonlinear magnetoresistivity tensor at arbitrary value of competition between point - like and anisotropic planar disorder for the case of in - plane geometry of experiment .",
    "this approach will give us the experimentally important theoretical model which demonstrates the @xmath53-anisotropy for all @xmath3 and predicts a nonlinear change of the @xmath26 sign at some set of parameters ( without change of the hall _ conductivity _ ) due a competition of the washboard ppp and a point - like disorder .",

    "<S> explicit current - dependent expressions for anisotropic longitudinal and transverse nonlinear magnetoresistivities are represented and analyzed on the basis of a fokker - planck approach for two - dimensional single - vortex dynamics in a washboard pinning potential in the presence of point - like disorder . </S>",
    "<S> graphical analysis of the resistive responses is presented both in the current - angle coordinates and in the rotating current scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes nonlinear anisotropy effects caused by the competition of point - like ( isotropic ) and anisotropic pinning . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear guiding effects are discussed and the critical current anisotropy is analyzed . gradually increasing the magnitude of isotropic pinning force </S>",
    "<S> this theory predicts a gradual decrease of the anisotropy of the magnetoresistivities . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of transition from the new scaling relations for anisotropic hall resistance in the absence of point - like pins to the well - known scaling relations for the point - like disorder is elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> this is discussed in terms of a gradual isotropizaton of the guided vortex motion , which is responsible for the existence in a washboard pinning potential of new ( with respect to magnetic field reversal ) hall voltages . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that whereas the hall conductivity is not changed by pinning , the hall resistivity can change its sign in some current - angle range due to presence of the competition between _ i_- and _ a_-pins . </S>"
