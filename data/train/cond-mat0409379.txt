    "the two - dimensional @xmath2-@xmath3 model was proposed by anderson @xcite for the description of strong electron correlations in cu - o planes of perovskite high-@xmath4 superconductors . in ref .",
    "the similarity of the low - energy part of its spectrum with the spectrum of the realistic three - band hubbard model was demonstrated .",
    "nowadays the @xmath2-@xmath3 model is one of the most frequently used models for the interpretation of experimental results in cuprates ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "different numerical and analytical methods were used for the investigation of the model . among these methods",
    "are the exact diagonalization of small clusters , @xcite monte carlo simulations , @xcite density matrix renormalization group calculations , @xcite spin - wave @xcite and mean - field slave - boson approximations .",
    "@xcite in spite of the considerable progress made towards the understanding of the properties of the model , the basic issues of its behavior in going from light to heavy hole doping have not yet been completely resolved . in particular",
    ", there is still no clear knowledge of how the narrow spin - polaron band inherent in light doping is converted to a wide band observed in photoemission of optimally and overdoped crystals .",
    "@xcite the investigation of the variation of the magnetic susceptibility with the hole doping , temperature and the damping of excitations is also of great importance in view of a great body of data obtained in inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite    aiming at a description for the wide range of hole concentrations in this paper we use the method @xcite based on mori s projection operator technique .",
    "@xcite the method allows one to derive self - energy equations for green s functions constructed from hubbard operators without recourse to the intricate diagrammatic technique .",
    "these equations retain the rotation symmetry of spin components inherent in the hamiltonian and do not imply any preset magnetic ordering .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , where this approach was implemented for the spin subsystem only , in this work we use it also for the hole subsystem .",
    "the obtained equations were self - consistently solved in a 20@xmath1520 lattice for the ranges of hole concentrations @xmath0 and temperatures @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hopping constant of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model . in cuprates",
    "this concentration range covers the regions from light to heavy doping .",
    "the ratios of the exchange @xmath3 and hopping parameters of the model @xmath16 and @xmath17 were used .",
    "such ratios correspond to hole - doped cuprates .",
    "@xcite for @xmath18  ev the boundaries of the above temperature range correspond approximately to 30  k and 120  k.    obtained results indicate that the hole band transforms radically at @xmath5 .",
    "a narrow low - concentration band with minima near @xmath6 is converted to a band resembling in its shape the case of weak electron correlations , with the minimum at @xmath7 or at @xmath8 in dependence on the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the hole fermi surface is respectively changed from small elliptical pockets at @xmath6 to a large rhombus centered at @xmath7 or @xmath8 . with increasing @xmath19",
    "the maximum in the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath20 at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath21 loses its intensity and shifts to higher frequencies .",
    "this behavior is mainly connected with the growth of the frequency of spin excitations at * q * and is consistent with experimental data .",
    "the shape of the frequency dependence of @xmath22 depends heavily on the hole damping and varies from a broad feature similar to that observed @xcite in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 to a pronounced maximum which is analogous to the normal - state resonance peak @xcite in yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 .",

    "damping is connected with the hole - magnon scattering .",
    "@xcite however , in this work the damping is considered as a free parameter to take into account other possible damping processes .",
    "such approach is motivated by the fact that the damping of spin excitations ( [ sgf ] ) depends heavily on the value of @xmath80 and to investigate different shapes of the frequency dependence of the susceptibility @xmath80 is considered as a variable parameter .",
    "thus , in the present work the calculation of the elements of the continued fraction @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the spin green s function was carried out up to the second order : @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 were calculated .",
    "then the residual term of the continued fraction ( the part of the fraction containing the third and higher order terms ) which is represented by the many - particle green s function ( [ terminator ] ) is approximated by the decoupling .",

    "the residual part of the continued fraction was omitted and the artificial damping @xmath80 was added . the main argument for the above truncations of the continued fractions",
    "is based on the results obtained previously . in ref .",
    "the analogous truncation in the equations of motion with the decoupling improved by a vertex correction was successfully used for the description of spin excitations in the heisenberg model . for the lightly doped @xmath2-@xmath3 model",
    "this approximation was used in ref .",
    "and the results obtained were in good agreement with the exact diagonalization of small clusters .",
    "the two - pole approximation for the hole green s function was shown to give a good description of the spin - polaron band for moderate @xmath84 in the spin - wave approach .",
    "@xcite in a more general perspective the used method is a version of the lanczos algorithm .",

    "the shape of the band depends only weakly on the sign of @xmath2 . with increasing @xmath19 the band changes rapidly and already for moderate concentrations",
    "its shapes for opposite signs of @xmath2 differ essentially and resemble shapes of weakly correlated bands .",

    "the decrease of the temperature to @xmath92 , of the hole damping to @xmath93 or the increase of the exchange constant to @xmath94 do not change qualitatively the evolution of the hole band with doping . for all these parameters the transformation of the hole band from the shape typical for strong correlations to that resembling the weakly correlated case occurs at @xmath95 . as this takes place , the respective fermi surface , shown in the base planes in figs .",

    "the van hove singularity of the hole band located at @xmath96 remains near the fermi level in the wide range of hole concentrations @xmath97 .",
    "the reason for the above transformation of the band shape is in the following . for small hole concentrations",
    "the hole dispersion is determined by the magnetic ordering which is close to the long - range antiferromagnetic order . in this case the elementary cell in the direct space is doubled due to the opposite alignment of spins on neighboring sites .",
    "hence the brillouin zone becomes half the value of the paramagnetic zone and the points @xmath8 and @xmath7 become equivalent .",
    "in particular , this means that the hole dispersion is approximately invariant with respect to the substitution @xmath98 , as seen in the upper parts of fig .",

    "the hole dispersion is determined by @xmath104 which becomes larger than @xmath82 and the band acquires the shape which is similar to the case of weak correlations .",

    "the analogous transformation of the hole band is expected also in the more complicated and flexible @xmath2-@xmath107-@xmath108-@xmath3 model which is frequently used for the interpretation of experimental results in cuprates .",
    "@xcite the respective value of the hole concentration is supposed to be close to @xmath109 .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that the transformation occurs when the correlation length approaches a few lattice spacings .",
    "the correlation length derived from neutron scattering experiments @xcite in cuprates acquires this value near the mentioned concentration .    in the considered two - pole approximation",
    "only one hole band crosses the fermi level .",
    "in contrast to this the calculations based on the spin - wave approximation @xcite and on the approach of ref .  , which are supposed to be more accurate for low hole concentrations , show that for @xmath110 there are two bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "one of these bands is the spin - polaron band which corresponds to a pronounced peak in the hole spectral function and has the dispersion similar to that shown in upper parts of figs .",
    "[ fig_i ] and [ fig_ii ] .",
    "the second band has a much weaker and broader peak in @xmath111 and therefore its contribution to the lower band of the two - pole approximation can be neglected .",
    "thus , the lower hole band which cross the fermi level corresponds to the feature with the highest peak intensity in the hole spectrum  the spin - polaron band .",
    "the upper band corresponds to `` everything else '' in the hole spectrum . from previous considerations ( see refs .   and references therein ) it is known that in @xmath111 for low @xmath19 several weaker and broader maxima are located above the spin - polaron peak .",
    "these maxima merge into one broad maximum at larger concentrations .",
    "the upper band of the two - pole approximation gives a rough description for these peculiarities of the hole spectrum .",
    "since states near the fermi level are of main interest and this approximation gives a satisfactory description for these states , it is used in the present work .",

    "<S> the regions of hole concentrations @xmath0 and temperatures @xmath1 are studied in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model of cu - o planes of perovskite high-@xmath4 superconductors . for this purpose self - energy equations for hole and spin green s functions </S>",
    "<S> are derived using mori s projection operator technique and these equations are self - consistently solved . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated hole band transforms radically at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow low - concentration band with minima near @xmath6 is converted to a band resembling the case of weak electron correlations , with the minimum at @xmath7 or @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the hole fermi surface is respectively changed from small ellipses at @xmath6 to a large rhombus centered at @xmath7 or @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the magnetic susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wave vector and spin correlations with doping is determined by the growth of the frequency of spin excitations at this momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the frequency dependence of the susceptibility depends heavily on the hole damping and varies from a broad feature similar to that observed in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 to a pronounced maximum which resembles the normal - state resonance peak in yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 . </S>"
