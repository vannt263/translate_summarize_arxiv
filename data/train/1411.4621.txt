    "in this paper , we give a straightforward proof of the jordan curve theorem in 2d discrete spaces with respect to the general definition of discrete curves , surfaces , and manifolds discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the jordan curve theorem states that a simple and closed curve separates a simply connected surface into two components .",
    "based on the definition of discrete surfaces , we give three reasonable definitions of simply connected spaces in discrete spaces .",
    "theoretically , these three definitions are equivalent .    for the jordan curve theorem , o. veblen in 1905 wrote a paper  @xcite that was regraded as the first correct proof of this fundamental theorem on 2d euclidean plane . the first discrete proof was given by w.t .",

    "chen added some missing parts of this proofs in 2013 @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", chen adopted some original ideas from veblen s paper and gave a proof of this theorem in discrete form .    in this paper , we want to give a simple and easy version of the proofs given in @xcite without gone through many definitions of discrete geometry",
    ".    a discrete surface can be viewed as a digital surface or a triangulated 2d meshes . intuitively , a discrete 2-cell in this paper is a smallest or minimal unite for 2d objects .",
    "a discrete 2-cell can not be slitted into two other 2-cells .",
    "the union of two ( discrete ) 2-cells , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will not be a two cell if @xmath2 .",
    "( in discrete space , an object is mainly formed by vertices or points . the others such as edges , faces are based on human s interpretation . ) in other words , the smallest unite does not contain any other 2-cell .",
    "when we say a 2-cell , we need to think this `` thing '' as the smallest one containing some vertices and edges .",
    "please note that this definition is different from the standard definition in topology .",
    "we know that a discrete surface can be naturally embedded to euclidean plane or a closed continuous surface such as a sphere .",
    "indeed , a discrete surface can be easily embedded to a 3d or higher dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "let us first review some concepts of discrete curves in @xcite : ( 1 ) a simple path is called a ( discrete ) pseudo - curve , ( 2 ) a simple semi - curve can be a curve or a surface - cell ( 2-cell ) ( in discrete form , a set containing all vertices means that the set contains all 2-cell in this set .",
    "at least it is true for this paper .",
    "see details in @xcite for general non simply connected surfaces . )",
    "( 3 ) a simple curve must not contain any proper subset that is a 2-cell .",
    "it is obvious , if we define a simple path ( a pseudo - curve in this paper ) a discrete curve , there is no jordan curve theorem in discrete space .",
    "this is because that the inner part of a 2-cell is empty in graph - structures .",
    "this little difference will not affect the continuous version of the theorem .",
    "in discrete cases , we will make a point called `` the veblen point '' to deal with this when we desire a closer version of the theorem to the continuous case .",
    "we defined regular points in a discrete manifolds in @xcite .",
    "it just means that every point on surface has a neighborhood that is similar to a 2d disk ( homeomorphic equivalence in topology ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be the neighborhood of @xmath4 in @xmath5 . if @xmath5 is a triangulated surface , then    @xmath6    or @xmath7 where @xmath8 is graph - distance .",
    "for any type of discrete surfaces , @xmath9 .",
    "we proved that for a discrete surface @xmath5 , if @xmath4 is a inner and regular point of @xmath5 , then there exists a simple cycle containing all points in @xmath10 in @xmath5 .",
    "this result is particularly important in our proof , but it is very intuitive too .",
    "we present this result as lemma 1 @xcite .",
    "for a discrete surface @xmath5 , if @xmath4 is a inner and regular point of @xmath5 , then there exists a simple cycle containing all points in @xmath10 in @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the neighborhood of @xmath4 in @xmath5 .    in topology ,",
    "the formal description of the jordan curve theorem is : a simply closed curve @xmath11 in a plane @xmath12 decomposes @xmath13 into two components .",
    "@xcite in fact , this theorem holds for any simply connected 2d surface .",
    "a plane is a simply connected surface in euclidean space , but this theorem is not true for a general continuous surface .",
    "for example , the boundary of a donut .",
    "we now introduce the meaning of discrete deformation and simply connected discrete surfaces .    what is a simply connected continuous surface ?",
    "a connected topological space @xmath14 is simply connected if for any point @xmath4 in @xmath14 , any simply closed curve containing @xmath4 can be contracted to @xmath4 .",
    "the contraction is a continuous mapping among a series of closed continuous curves .",
    "so , we first need the concept of `` discrete contraction . ''    here we also try to make the definition of simply connected discrete surfaces to be simpler .",
    "the more detailed definition was in @xcite .",
    "the `` contraction '' means the sequence of curves will be getting smaller and smaller until they shrink to a point .",
    "these curves do not cross each other .",
    "( they do not have to be cross each other .",
    "this is a key too . )",
    "so our concept of contraction is that a discrete curve will be graduate varied to a `` smaller '' one , and keep the process until `` shrink '' to a point .",
    "these discrete curves do not cross each other .",
    "they can share some points .    in order to keep the concepts simple to understand , we defined the gradual variation between two simple paths in @xcite .",
    "we defined discrete deformation among discrete pseudo curves . and",
    "finally , we define the contraction of curves is a type of discrete deformation .",
    "see @xcite for more details of the definitions .",
    "the reader can just use the natural interpretation of definitions . in paper , we assume the discrete surface is both regular and orientable too . the algorithm to decide if a discrete surface is orientable can be found in @xcite .    intuitively , two simple paths @xmath15 and @xmath16 are said to be gradually varied if there is no hole in between @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in addition , there is no jump from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "more formally , two simple paths @xmath15 and @xmath16 are called * gradually varied * if @xmath17 consists of 1-cells and 2-cells where no cycle in @xmath17 that is not a 2-cell or the union of 2-cells . in other words ,",

    "@xmath20 is called @xmath21 in newman s book @xcite . @xmath15",
    "and @xmath16 are gradually varied iff @xmath22 are the union of 2-cells .",
    "to prove the jordan curve theorem , we need to describe what the disconnected components are by means of separated from a simple curve @xmath15 ?",
    "it means that any path from a component to another must include at least a point in @xmath15 .",
    "it also means that this linking path must cross - over the curve @xmath15 .",
    "we will define the concept of `` cross - over '' in the following .    because a surface - cell @xmath0 is a closed path , we can define two orientations ( normals ) to @xmath0 : clockwise and counter - clockwise .",
    "usually , the orientation of a 2-cell is not a critical issue .",
    "however , for the proof of the jordan curve theorem it is necessary .",
    "in other words , a pseudo - curve which is a set of points has no `` direction , '' but as a path @xmath23 , it has its own `` travel direction '' from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .    for two paths @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are gradually varied , if a 2-cell @xmath0 is in @xmath26 , the orientation of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath15 is determined by the first pair of points @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , if a 1-cell of @xmath0 is in @xmath15 , then the orientation of @xmath0 is fixed with respect to @xmath15 .    according to lemma 1",

    "it is easy to see that the simple cycle @xmath10 separates @xmath33 into at least two connected components because from @xmath4 to any other points in @xmath5 the path must contain a point in @xmath10 .",

    "we also say that @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the above lemma are side - gradually varied .    if two simple paths @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not cross - over each other , and they are gradually varied , then every surface - cell in @xmath26 has the same orientation with respect to the `` travel direction '' of @xmath15 and opposite to the `` travel direction '' of @xmath16 .    intuitively , a simply connected set is such a set so that for any point , every simple cycle containing this point can contract to the point .",

    "this definition of the simply connected set is based on the original meaning of simple contraction . in order to make the task of proving the jordan theorem simpler ,",
    "we give the third strict definition of simply connected surfaces as follows .",
    "we know that a simple closed path ( simple cycle ) has at least three vertices in a simple graph .",

    "we have proved the following proposition in @xcite .    definition ( b ) and definition ( c ) are equivalent .",
    "since a simple cycle is a closed simple path that could be a surface - cell that can not separate @xmath15 into two disconnected components .",

    "a discrete curve @xmath15 does not contain a subset of vertices that are not all vertices of a 2 cell in @xmath51 .",
    "the intuitive meaning is that @xmath15 does not contain any 2-cell .",
    "a 2-cell will have two directions : the clockwise and the counter - clockwise .",
    "if we imagine a point at the center of 2-cell , we will have two normals .",
    "( this is also true for 1-cell ) this point will be called the central pseudo point . in the case of allowing the central pseudo points that will be called the veblen point , we will have the general jordan curve theorem .",
    "we will prove this case at the last of this section .",
    "the idea of the central pseudo point is valid when embedding a surface ( or cells ) into euclidean space .",
    "the proof of the jordan curve theorem in discrete space will need to use the following proposition :    if @xmath68 is an edge , define @xmath69 . then , @xmath70 is a simple path",

    "a degenerated ( closed ) path is a simple path with several unclosed discrete curve attach to some vertices on the path .",
    "this is because , in discrete case , some part of the simple path shrink or folded into a poly - line .    when every `` angle '' in a discrete curve @xmath15 is little wide meaning that contains three 2-cells . in other words , for each three consecutive points @xmath76 in @xmath15 , a path from @xmath77 to @xmath78 without passing @xmath79 , there are must be two other vertices in between .",

    "we also request any two vertices that are not adjacent will have the graph - distance greater than 2 .",
    "the purpose is to guarantee that @xmath75 is a simple closed path .",
    "we denote the wideness of an angle is the minimum number of edges in the path from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( each edge is in different 2-cell containing @xmath79 ) .",
    "note that an angle with wideness 1 will make that @xmath15 is not a discrete curve . since @xmath15 contains a triangle that is a 2-cell . )",

    "then , @xmath75 is a closed simple path",
    ".    we will prove this lemma in the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "we know that we can easily make @xmath15 in 2d euclidean plane to be a wide angle by adding some lines to the veblen points on a edge .",
    "( do not make extra veblen point used just for a 2-cell , use it for the 2-cell that share the veblen point . )",
    "the following theorem is for @xmath15 with the wider angles . to direct prove this theorem for general case meaning allowing that @xmath75 is a degenerated ( closed ) simple path",
    ". we will give the proof in appendix .",
    "for a closed discrete curve , we have    ( * the jordan curve theorem in discrete space * ) a discrete simply connected surfaces @xmath5 defined by definition 5 ( definition ( c ) ) , has the jordan property : for a closed discrete curve @xmath15 on @xmath5 , if @xmath15 does not contain any point of @xmath82 , @xmath15 divides @xmath5 into at least two disconnected components . in other words , @xmath83 consists of at least two disconnected components .",

    "so we can assume that:(1 ) the wideness of each angle is 3 or greater , and ( 2 ) for any two nonadjacent vertices @xmath4 and @xmath34 in @xmath15 , any path not including edges in @xmath15 from @xmath4 to @xmath34 much contain three edges that belong to three different 2-cells .",
