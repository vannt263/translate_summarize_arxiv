    "the first part of this dissertation includes three chapters . in chapter 1 ,",
    "an introduction about the foundations of quantum mechanics , which is mainly concentrated on explanations of ; some problems in the standard quantum mechanics , the quantum theory of motion , some new insights presented by bohmian quantum mechanics and noting some objections that have been advanced against this theory , has been presented . in chapter 2 , by using position entanglement property of two particles in a symmetrical two - plane of double - slit system , we have shown that the standard and bohmian quantum mechanics can predict different results at an individual level of entangled pairs . however , as expected , the two theories predict the same interference pattern at an ensemble level of the particles . in chapter 3 , the predictions of the standard and bohmain quantum mechanics have been compared using a double - slit system including two correlated particles .",
    "it has been shown that using a selective joint detection of the two particles at special conditions , the two theories can be distinguished at a statistical level of the selected particles .",
    "but , by considering all particles , the predictions of the two theories are still identical at the ensemble level of particles .",
    "in the second part of the dissertation there are also three chapters . in its first chapter , i.e. chapter 4 , an introduction about quantum information theory including quantum dense coding and",
    "teleportation has been presented . in chapter 5 , using a two - particle source similar to that is applied in chapter 1 , a more efficient quantum dense coding scheme has been proposed . in this regard ,",
    "the suitable encoding and decoding unitary operators along with its corresponding bell states have been studied .",
    "the rate of classical information gain of this scheme has been obtained and then compared with some other well - known protocols .",
    "furthermore , possibility of designing of the required position operators using some basic gates and one conditional position gates has been investigated .",
    "next , in chapter 6 , using a system the same as the dense coding scheme , wave function teleportation of a three dimensional object having some other degrees of freedom has been studied . concerning this ,",
    "the required operators for performing bell state measurement and reconstruction process have been designed using some position and momentum gates .    in appendix , which consists three sections , some more details on",
    "our considered epr source , preparing and measuring processes utilized in some initial cases of the dense coding and teleportation schemes , and comparison of our dense coding scheme with some other ones can be found .",
    "the standard view of quantum mechanics ( sqm ) , accepted almost universally by physicists , is commonly termed the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "this interpretation requires complementarity , e.g. wave - particle duality , inherent indeterminism at the most fundamental level of quantum phenomena , and the impossibility of an event - by - event causal representation in a continuous space - time background @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "some problems embodied in this interpretation are concisely described in the following .      [",
    "[ measurement ] ] measurement + + + + + + + + + + +    as an example , consider a two - state microsystem whose eigenfunctions are labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , there is a macrosystem apparatus with eigenfunctions @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to an output for the microsystem having been in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states , respectively . since prior to a measurement we do not know the state of the microsystem , it is a superposition state given by @xmath4 now",
    ", according to the linearity of scrdinger s equation , the final state obtained after the interaction of the two systems is @xmath5 where it is assumed that initially the two systems are far apart and do not interact .",
    "it is obvious that , the state on the far right side of the last equation does not correspond to a definite state for a macrosystem apparatus .",
    "in fact , this result would say that the macroscopic apparatus is itself in a superposition of both plus and minus states .",
    "nobody has observed such macroscopic superpositions .",
    "this is the so - called measurement problem , since the theory predicts results that are in clear conflict with all observations .",
    "it is at this point that the standard program to resolve this problem invokes the reduction of wave packet upon observation , that is , @xmath6 various attempts to find reasonable explanation for this reduction are at the heart of the measurement problem .",
    "[ [ schrdingers - cat ] ] schrdinger s cat",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    concerning the measurement problem , there is a paradox introduced by schrdinger in 1935 .",
    "he suggested the coupling of an uranium nucleus or atom as a microsystem and a live cat in a box as a macrosystem .",
    "the system is so arranged that , if the nucleus with a life time @xmath7 decays , it triggers a device that kills the cat .",
    "now the point is to consider a quantum description of the time evolution of the system .",
    "if @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the wave functions of the system , cat and atom , respectively , then the initial state of the system would be @xmath11 this initial state evolves into @xmath12 and the probabilities of interest are @xmath13 as time goes on , chance looks less for the cat s survival . before one observes the system , @xmath8 represents a superposition of a live and a dead cat .",
    "however , after observation the wave function is reduced to live or dead one .",
    "now , the main question which was posed by schrdinger is : what does @xmath8 represent ?",
    "possible answers are that , it represents ( 1 ) our state of knowledge , and so quantum mechanics is incomplete , and ( 2 ) the actual state of the system which beers a sudden change upon observation . if we choose ( 1 ) ( which is what schrdinger felt intuitively true )",
    ", then quantum mechanics is incomplete , i.e. , there are physically meaningful questions about the system that it can not answer - surly the cat was either alive or dead before observation .",
    "on the other hand , choice ( 2 ) faces us with the measurement problem , in which the actual collapse of the wave function must be explained .    [",
    "[ the - classical - limit ] ] the classical limit + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is well established that when a theory supersedes an earlier one , whose domain of validity has been determined , it must reduce to the old one in a proper limit .",
    "for example , in the special theory of relativity there is a parameter @xmath14 such that when @xmath15 , the equations of special relativity reduce to those of classical mechanics . in general relativity ,",
    "also , the limit of weak gravitational fields or small space - time curvature leads to newtonian gravitational theory .",
    "if quantum mechanics is to be a candidate for a fundamental physical theory that replaces classical mechanics , then we would expect that there is a suitable limit in which the equations of quantum mechanics approach those of classical mechanics .",
    "it is often claimed that the desired limit is @xmath16 .",
    "but @xmath17 is not a dimensionless constant and it is not possible for us to set it equal to zero .",
    "a more formal attempt at a classical limit is ehrenfest s theorem , according to which expectation values satisfy newton s second law as @xmath18 this really only implies that the centroid of the packet follows the classical trajectory .",
    "however , wave packets spread and the above equation is just not the same as @xmath19 .",
    "a similar formal attempt is the wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation which is often advertised as a classical limit of the schrdinger s equation .",
    "again , there is not a well - defined limit ( in terms of a dimensionless parameter ) for which one can obtain exactly the equations of classical mechanics for all future of times .",
    "therefore , if it is not possible to find a classical description for macroscopic objects in a suitable limit , then we do not have a complete theory that is applicable to both the micro and macro domains .",
    "[ [ concept - of - the - wave - function ] ] concept of the wave function + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the quantum theory that developed in the 1920s is related to its classical predecessor by the mathematical procedure of quantization , in which classical dynamics variables are replaced by operators .",
    "hence , a new entity appeares on which the operators act , i.e. , the wave function . for a single - body system this is a complex function , @xmath20 , and for a field it is a complex functional , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "in fact , the wave function introduces a new notion of the state of a physical system .",
    "but , in prosecuting their quantization procedure , the founding fathers introduced the new notion of the state not in addition to the classical variables but instead of them .",
    "they could not see , and finally did not want to see , even when presented with a consistent example , how to retain in some form the assumption that matter has substance and form , independently of whether or not it is observed .",
    "the wave function alone was adapted as the most complete characterizing the state of a system .",
    "since there was no deterministic way to describe individual processes using just the wave function , it seemed natural to claim that these are indeterminate and unanalyzable in principle .",
    "furthermore , quantum mechanics appears essentially as a set of working rules for computing the likely outcomes of certain as yet undefined processes called measurement .",
    "so , one might well ask what happened to the original program embodied in the old quantum theory of explaining the stability of atoms as objective structures in space - time .",
    "in fact , quantum mechanics leaves the primitive notion of system undefined ; it contains no statement regarding the objective constitution of matter corresponding to the conception of particles and fields employed in classical physics .",
    "there are no electrons or atoms in the sense of distinct localized entities beyond the act of observation .",
    "these are simply names attributed to the mathematical symbols @xmath10 to distinguish one functional form from another one .",
    "so the original quest to comprehend atomic structure culminated in just a set of rules governing laboratory practice . to summarize , according to the completeness assumption of sqm , the wave function is associated with an individual physical system .",
    "it provides the most complete description of the system that is , in principle , possible .",
    "the nature of the description is statistical , and concerns the probabilities of the outcomes of all conceivable measurements that may be performed on the system .",
    "therefore , in this view , quantum mechanics does not present a causal and deterministic theory for the universe .",
    "we have seen that , the quantum world is inexplicable in classical terms .",
    "the predictions concerning the interaction of matter and light , embodied in newtonian mechanics and maxwell s equations , are inconsistent with the experimental facts at the microscopic level .",
    "an important feature of quantum effects is their apparent indeterminism , that individual atomic events are unpredictable , uncontrollable , and literally seem to have no cause .",
    "regularities emerge only when one considers a large ensemble of such events .",
    "this indeed is generally considered to constitute the heart of the conceptual problem posed by quantum phenomena .",
    "a way of resolving this problem is that the wave function does not correspond to a single physical system but rather to an ensemble of systems . in this view",
    ", the wave function is admitted to be an incomplete representation of actual physical states and plays a role roughly analogous to the distribution function in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "now , to understand experimental results as the outcome of a causally connected series of individual processes , one can seek further significance of the wave function ( beyond its probabilistic aspect ) , and can introduce other concepts ( hidden variables ) in addition to the wave function .",
    "it was in this spirit that bohm @xcite in 1952 proposed his theory and showed how underlying quantum mechanics is a causal theory of the motion of waves and particles which is consistent with a probabilistic outlook , but does not require it .",
    "in fact , the additional element that he introduced apart from the wave function is just a particle , conceived in the classical sense of pursuing a definite continuous track in space - time",
    ". the basic postulates of bohm s quantum mechanics ( bqm ) can be summarized as follows : + _ 1 . _",
    "an individual physical system comprises a wave propagating in space - time together with a particle which moves continuously under the guidance of the wave .",
    "the wave is mathematically described by @xmath20 which is a solution to the scrdinger s equation : @xmath22 _ 3 . _",
    "the particle motion is determined by the solution @xmath23 to the guidance condition @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase of @xmath10 .",
    "+ these three postulates on their own constitute a consistent theory of motion .",
    "since bqm involves physical assumptions that are not usually made in quantum mechanics , it is preferred to consider it as a new theory of motion which is appropriately called the quantum theory of motion @xcite . in order to ensure the compatibility of the motions of the ensemble of particles with the results of quantum mechanics , bohm added the following further postulate : + _ 4 . _ the probability that a particle in the ensemble lies between the points @xmath26 and @xmath27 at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this shows that the concept of probability in bqm only enters as a subsidiary condition on a causal theory of the motion of individuals , and the statistical meaning of the wave function is of secondary importance .",
    "failure to recognize this has been the source of much confusion in understanding the causal interpretation .    now , here , it is proper to compare and contrast bohm s quantum theory with the standard one . it can be seen that , some of the most perplexing interpretational problems of sqm are simply solved in bqm .",
    "[ [ no - measurement - problem ] ] no measurement problem + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the most elegant aspects of bqm is its treatment on the measurement problem , where it becomes a non - problem . in bqm , measurement is a dynamical and essentially many - body process .",
    "there is no collapse of the wave function , and so no measurement problem .",
    "the basic idea is that a particle always has a definite position before measurement .",
    "so there is no superposition of properties , and measurement or observation is just an attempt to discover this position .    to clarify the subject , consider , as an example , an inhomogeneous magnetic field which produces a spatial separation among the various angular momentum components of an incident beam of atoms .",
    "the incident wave packet @xmath31 moves with a velocity @xmath32 along the @xmath33-axis .",
    "this function @xmath31 ( e.g. , a gaussian ) is fairly sharply peaked about @xmath34 .",
    "the initial quantum state of the atom is a superposition of angular momentum eigenstates @xmath35 of the atom .",
    "thus , the initial wave function for the system before the atom has entered the region of the magnetic field can be written as @xmath36 the interaction between the inhomogeneous magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the atom exerts a net force on the atom in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "once the packet emerges from the field , the @xmath38 components of the packet diverge along separate paths .",
    "after that sufficient time has elapsed , the @xmath38 component packets no longer overlap and have essentially disjoint supports .",
    "then the wave function has evolved into @xmath39e^{i\\varphi_n}\\psi_{n}(\\xi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 show the particle trajectories and the @xmath41 are simply constant phases . the description given",
    "sofar is similar to an account of a measurement in sqm frame .",
    "so , the next step would be to apply the projection postulate once an atom has been observed .",
    "one would simply erase the other packets . in bqm",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "the probability of finding the atom at some particular position is @xmath42|^2|\\psi_{n}(\\xi)|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are no interference or cross terms here , because the various @xmath43 no longer overlap .",
    "after the particle has been found in one packet , it can not be in any of the others and has negligible probability of crossing to other ones ( because @xmath44 effectively vanishes between the packets ) .",
    "now , it is necessary that the microsystem interact , effectively irreversibly , with a macroscopic measuring device that has many degrees of freedom to make it practically impossible ( i.e. , overwhelmingly improbable ) for these lost wave packets to interfere once again with the one actually containing the particle .",
    "thus , the process of measurement is a two - step one in which ( 1 ) the quantum states of the microsystem are separated into nonoverlapping parts by an , in principle , reversible interaction and ( 2 ) a practically irreversible interaction with a macroscopic apparatus registers the final results .",
    "[ [ the - classical - limit-1 ] ] the classical limit + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    by using the guidance condition along with the schrdinger s equation , the quantum dynamical equation for the motion of a particle with mass @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the usual classical potential energy and @xmath48 is the so - called quantum potential that is given in terms of the wave function as @xmath49 this @xmath48 has the classically unexpected feature that its value depends sensitively on the shape , but not necessarily strongly on the magnitude of @xmath50 , so that @xmath48 need not falloff with distance as @xmath47 does .",
    "now , it is evident that there are no problems in obtaining the classical equations of motion from bqm , because the above dynamical equation has the form of newton s second law .",
    "in fact , when @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( dimensionless parameters ) the quantum dynamical equation becomes just the classical equation of motion .",
    "so the suitable limit is @xmath53 ( in the sense of @xmath54 and also ( @xmath55 ) , rather than anything like @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting to know that there are solutions to the schrdinger s equation with no classical limit ( quantum system with no classical analogue ) .",
    "thus , one can not exclude a priori the possibility that there be a class of solutions to the classical equations of motion which do not correspond to the limit of some class of quantum solutions ( classical systems with no quantum analogue ) .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to conceive classical mechanics as a special case of quantum mechanics in the sense that the latter has new elements ( @xmath17 and @xmath48 ) not anticipated in the former .",
    "however , the possibility that the classical theory admits more general types of ensemble which can not be described using the limit of quantum ensembles , because the latter corresponds to a specific type of linear wave equation and satisfy special conditions such as being built from single - valued conserved pure states , suggests that the two statistical theories can be considered independent while having a common domain of application .",
    "this domain is characterized by @xmath53 in the quantum theory .",
    "now , there is a well - defined conceptual and formal connection between the classical and quantum domains but , as a new result , they merely intersect rather than are being contained in the other .    [ [ the - uncertainty - relations ] ] the uncertainty relations + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the basic features of quantum mechanics is the association of hermitian operators with physical observables , and the consequent appearance of noncommutation relations between the operators .",
    "for example , whatever the interpretation , from sqm or bqm one can obtain the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath56 for operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 that satisfy @xmath59=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] @xcite . as a result",
    ", a wave function can not be simultaneously an eigenfunction of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since measuring of an observable involves the transformation of the wave function into an eigenfunction of the associated operator , it appears that a system can not simultaneously be in a state by which its position and momentum are precisely known .",
    "how may one reconcile the uncertainty relation with the assumption that a particle can be ascribed simultaneously well - defined position and momentum variables as properties that exist during all interactions , including measurements ? to answer this , we note that our knowledge of the state of a system should not be confused with what the state actually is .",
    "quantum mechanics is constructed so that we can not observe position and momentum simultaneously , but this fact does not prevent us to think of a particle having a well - defined track in reality .",
    "bohm s discussion shows how the act of measurement , through the influence of the quantum potential , can disturb the microsystem and thus produce an uncertainty in the outcome of a measurement @xcite .",
    "in other words , we can interpret the uncertainty relations as an expression of the different types of motion accessible to a particle when its wave undergoes the particular types of interaction appropriate to the measurement .",
    "in fact , the formal derivation of the uncertainty relations goes through as before , but now we have some understanding of how the spreads come about physically . according to bqm , the particle has a position and momentum prior to , during , and after the measurement , whether this be of position , momentum or any other observable . but in a measurement , we usually can not observe the real value that an observable had prior to the measurement .",
    "as bohm mentioned @xcite , in the suggested new interpretation , the so - called observables are not properties belonging to the observed system alone , but instead potentialities whose precise development depends just as much on the observing apparatus as on the observed system .",
    "[ [ concept - of - the - wave - function-1 ] ] concept of the wave function + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as we have seen , to find a connection between the two aspects of matter , i.e. particle and wave , one can rewrite the complex schrdinger s equation as a coupled system of equations for the real fields @xmath50 and @xmath25 which are defined by @xmath60 . then , in summary , these fields can play the following several roles simultaneously : + _ 1 .",
    "_ they are associated with two physical fields propagating in space - time and define , together with the particle , an individual physical system .",
    "_ they act as actual agents in the particle motion , via the quantum potential .",
    "they enter into the definition of properties associated with a particle ( momentum , energy and angular momentum ) .",
    "these are not arbitrarily specified but are a specific combination of these fields , and are closely related to the associated quantum mechanical operators .",
    "_ they have other meanings which ensure the consistency of bqm with sqm , and moreover , their connection with the classical mechanics . + generally in bqm , the wave function plays two conceptually different roles .",
    "it determines ( 1 ) the influence of the environment on the quantum system and ( 2 ) the probability density by @xmath61 .",
    "now , since the guidance condition along with the schrdinger s equation uniquely specify the future and past continuous evolution of the particle and field system , bqm forms the basis of a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "[ [ wave - function - of - the - universe ] ] wave function of the universe + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    by quantizing the hamiltonian constraint of general relativity in the standard way one obtains the wheeler - de witt s equation , which is the schrdinger s equation of the gravitational field . in this regard",
    ", there is an attempt to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole in the so - called quantum cosmology .",
    "this has been widely interpreted according to the many - worlds picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "but there is no need for this , because acoording to many physicists , quantum cosmology deals with a single system - our universe .",
    "we have seen that , bqm is eminently suited to a description of systems that are essentially unique , such as the universe .",
    "therefore , quantum cosmology is independent of any subsidiary probability interpretation one may like to attach to the wave function .

    "in fact , these features characterize the extremes of quantum behavior and , in principle , there exist states for which the right hand side of the above equation of motion is a scalar and local function of the space - time coordinate . the fact that this term is finite means that although the wave will be essentially nonclassical but will obey the type of equation we might postulate for a classical field , in which the scalar wave equation is equated to some function of the field . here , the interesting point is that using quantization of a massless field it is possible to give mass to the field in the sense that the quantum wave obeys the classical massive klein - gordon equation @xmath63 as a special case for the equation of motion of a massless quantum field , where @xmath45 is a real constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantum potential acts so that the massless quantum field behaves as if it were a classical field with mass .",
    "there are some of the typical objections that have been advanced against bqm .",
    "so , here , these objections are summarized and some preliminary answers are given to them .",

    "but sometimes it is considered to be in some way a defect , because local theories are considered to be preferable . yet",
    "nonlocality seems to be a small price to pay if the alternative is to forego any account of objective processes at all ( including local ones ) .",
    "furthermore , aspect s experiment @xcite established that , quantum mechanics is really a nonlocal theory without superluminal signalling @xcite .",

    "it follows that the results of the experiments designed to test the predictions of the theory , do not permit us to infer any statement regarding the particle  not even its independent existence .    in the bohmian quantum mechanics ( bqm ) , however , the additional element that is introduced apart from the wave function is the particle position , conceived in the classical sense as pursuing a definite continuous track in space - time [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the detailed predictions made by this causal interpretation explains how the results of quantum experiments come about , but it is claimed that they are not tested by them .",
    "in fact , when bohm @xcite presented his theory in 1952 , experiments could be done with an almost continuous beam of particles , but not with individual particles .",
    "thus , bohm constructed his theory in such a fashion that it would be impossible to distinguish observable predictions of his theory from sqm .",
    "this can be seen from bell s comment about empirical equivalence of the two theories when he said:_it _ [ the de broglie - bohm version of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ] _ is experimentally equivalent to the usual version insofar as the latter is unambiguous_\"@xcite .",
    "so , could it be that a certain class of phenomena might correspond to a well - posed problem in one theory but to none in the other ? or might definite trajectories of bohm s theory lead to a prediction of an observable where sqm would just have no definite prediction to make ?    to draw discrepancy from experiments involving the particle track , we have to argue in such a way that the observable predictions of the modified theory are in some way functions of the trajectory assumption .",
    "the question raised here is whether bqm s laws of motion can be made relevant to experiment . at first , it seems that definition of time spent by a particle within a classically forbidden barrier provides a good evidence for the preference of bqm .",

    "these conclusions are consistent with our earlier results ( eq .",
    "( [ y(t ) ] ) ) .",
    "so far , we have been studying the results obtained from bqm at the individual level .",

    "it is clear that the probabilistic prediction of sqm is in disagreement with the symmetrical prediction of bqm for the @xmath98 condition , because sqm predicts that probability of asymmetrical detection , at the individual level of a pair of particles , can be different from zero , in opposition to bqm s symmetrical predictions . in the other words , based on sqm s prediction ,",
    "the probability of finding the two particles on one side of the @xmath57-axis can be nonzero while we showed that bqm s prediction forbids such events in our scheme , and its probability is exactly zero .",

    ", this problem can be solved if we adjust @xmath117 to be very small .",
    "we assume that , to keep symmetrical detection about the @xmath57-axis with reasonable approximation , the center of mass dispersion in the @xmath33-direction must be smaller than the distance between any two neighboring maxima on the screens , that is , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the de broglie wavelength . by using eq .",

    "it is evident that , if one considers @xmath127 , as was done in @xcite , the incompatibility between the two theories will disappear .",
    "but because of the entanglement of the two particles in the @xmath33-direction , it is possible to adjust @xmath113 independent of @xmath77 , so that @xmath128 although it is obvious that @xmath129 , but the position entanglement of the two particles at the source @xmath25 in the @xmath33-direction makes them always satisfy eq .",
    "( [ interval ] ) , which is not feasible in the one - particle double - slit devices with @xmath130 .",
    "now , one can compare the results of sqm and bqm at the ensemble level of the particles . to do this",
    ", we consider an ensemble of pairs of particles that have arrived at the detection screens at different times @xmath131 .",
    "it is well known that , in order to ensure compatibility between sqm and bqm for ensemble of particles , bohm added a further postulate to his three basic and consistent postulates [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "based on this further postulate , the probability density that a particle in the ensemble lies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , at time @xmath28 , is given by @xmath132 thus , the joint probability of simultaneous detection for all pairs of particles of the ensemble , arriving on the two screens at different time @xmath133 , with @xmath98 , is @xmath134 where every term in the sum shows only one pair arriving on the screens at the symmetrical points about the @xmath57-axis at time @xmath131 , with the intensity of @xmath135 . if all times @xmath131 in the sum are taken to be @xmath28 , the summation on @xmath136 can be converted to an integral over all paths that cross the screens at that time .",
    "now , one can consider that the joint detection of two points on the two screens at time @xmath28 is not symmetrical around the @xmath57-axis , but we know that they are not detected simultaneously .",
    "so , it is possible to consider the joint probability of detecting two particles at two arbitrary points @xmath109 and @xmath110 as follows @xmath137 which is similar to the prediction of sqm , but obtained in a bohmian way .",
    "thus , it appears that under such conditions , the possibility of distinguishing the two theories at the statistical level is impossible , as expected .    here , to show equivalence of the two theories , we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath98 .",
    "if one consider @xmath108 or @xmath138 , the equivalence of the two theories is maintained , as it is argued by marchildon @xcite .",
    "but , using this special case , we show that assumption of @xmath98 is consistent with statistical results of sqm , and in consequence , finding such a source may not be impossible .      in some of recent comments @xcite ,",
    "the quantum equilibrium hypothesis ( qeh ) is utilized in order to show that our proposed experiment can not distinguish between sqm and bqm . in this section ,",
    "we have presented some explanations to show that their argument may not be right and our basic conclusions about this scheme are still intact .",
    "we have seen that , when the entangled particles pass through the slits , the transformation @xmath139 occurs to the wave function describing the system .",
    "now , it is interesting to know what can happen to the entanglement when the two particles emerge from the slits producing the gaussian wave functions represented by eq .",
    "( [ psiab ] ) . in the other words",
    ", there is a question as to whether the position entanglement property of the two particles is kept after this transformation . to answer this question",
    ", one can first examine the effect of the total momentum operator on the wave function of the system , @xmath140 , which yields @xmath141 where one can see that the wave function is an eigenfunction of the total momentum operator .",
    "now , if we can assume that the total momentum of the particles remains zero at all times ( an assumption about which we shall elaborate later on ) , then it can be concluded that the center of mass of the two particles in the @xmath33-direction is always located on the @xmath57-axis . in other words ,",
    "a momentum entanglement in the form @xmath142 leads to the position entanglement in this experiment .",
    "however , born s probability principle , i.e. @xmath61 , which is a basic rule in sqm , shows that the probability of asymmetrical joint detection of the two particles can be non - zero on the screens .",
    "thus , there is no position entanglement and consequently no momentum entanglement between the two particles .",
    "this compels us to believe that , according to sqm , the momentum entanglement of the two particles must be erased during their passage through the slits , and the center of mass position has to be distributed according to @xmath143 .    in bqm , however , born s probability principle is not so important as a primary rule and all particles follow well - defined tracks determined by the wave function @xmath144 , using the guidance condition ( [ guidance ] ) with the unitary time development governed by schr@xmath86dinger s equation .",
    "however , to ensure the consistency of statistical results of bqm with sqm , bohm @xcite added qeh , i.e. @xmath61 , to his self - consistent theory just as an additional assumption .",
    "now , let us review the previous details , but this time in bqm frame . based on our supposed epr source ,",
    "there are momentum and position entanglements between the two particles before they were arrived on the slits .",
    "then , the wave function of the emerging particles from the slits suffers a transformation represented by eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "it is not necessary to know in details how this transformation acts , but what is important is that the two double - slit screens are considered to be completely identical .",
    "thus , we expect that the two particles in the slits undergo the same transformation(s ) , and so the momentum entanglement , i.e. @xmath142 , must still be valid in bqm which is a deterministic theory , contrary to sqm . then , according to eq .",
    "( [ ppsi ] ) , the validity of the momentum entanglement immediately leads to the position entanglement @xmath145 we would like to point out that this entanglement is obtained by using the quantum wave function of the system .",
    "therefore , this claim that the supposed position entanglement can not be understood by using the assumed wave function for the system is not correct . by the way , if we accept that the momentum entanglement is not kept and consequently @xmath113 obeys qeh , then deterministic property of bqm , which is a main property of this theory , must be withdrawn .",
    "however , it is well known that bohm @xcite put qeh only as a subsidiary constraint to ensure the consistency of the motion of an ensemble of particles with sqm s results . thus",
    ", although in this experiment , the center of mass position of the two entangled particles turns out to be a constant in bqm frame , the position of each particle is consistent with qeh so that the final interference pattern is identical to what is predicted by sqm .",
    "therefore , bohm s aim concerning qeh is still satisfied and the deterministic property of bqm is left intact .",
    "in addition , superluminal signals resulting from nonlocal conditions between our distant entangled particles are precisely masked by considering qeh for the distribution of each entangled particle .",
    "so far , we have shown that in bqm frame , the center of mass position of the two entangled particles can be considered to be a constant , without any distribution .",
    "so , this property provides a way to make a discrepancy between sqm and bqm , even for an ensemble of entangled particles .",
    "for instance , suppose that we only consider those pairs one of which arrives at the upper half of the right screen .",
    "thus , bqm predicts that only detectors located on the lower half of the left screen become on and the other ones are always off . in fact , we obtain two identical interference patterns at the upper half of the right screen and the lower half of the left screen .",
    "instead , sqm is either silent or predicts a diluted interference pattern at the left screen .",
    "therefore , concerning the validity of the initial constraint @xmath98 in bqm , selecting of some pairs to obtain a desired pattern , which is called selective detection in @xcite , can be applied to evaluate the two theories , at the ensemble level of pairs .",
    "based on a recent work on bohmian trajectories for photons @xcite , the first effort for realization of a typical two - particle experiment was performed very recently by brida _",

    "we have suggested a two - particle system which can be adjusted to yield only symmetrical detections for the two entangled particles in bqm frame whilst according to sqm the probability for asymmetrical detections is not zero .",
    "the main reason for the existence of the mentioned differences between sqm and bqm in this thought experiment is that , in bqm as a deterministic theory , the position and momentum entanglements are kept at the slits , while in sqm , due to its probabilistic interpretation , we must inevitably accept that the entanglements of the two particles are erased when the two particles pass through the slits .",
    "incidentally , the saved position entanglement in bqm , i.e. @xmath98 , which is a result of the deterministic property of the thoery is not inconsistent with qeh , because we are still able to reproduce sqm s prediction for an ensemble of such particles , just as qeh requires .",
    "therefore , our proposed experiment is a suitable candidate to distinguish between the standard and bohmian quantum mechanics .",
    "the statistical interpretation of the wave function of the standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) is consistent with all performed experiments . an interference pattern on a screen",
    "is built up by a series of apparently random events , and the wave function correctly predicts where the particle is most likely to land in an ensemble of trials .",
    "one may , however , take the view that the characteristic distribution of spots on a screen which builds up an interference pattern is an evidence for the fact that the wave function has a more potent physical role . if one attempts to understand the experimental results as the outcome of a causally connected series of individual process , then one is free to inquire about further significance of the wave function and to introduce other concepts in addition to it .",
    "bohm @xcite , in 1952 , showed that an individual physical system comprises a wave propagating in space - time together with a point particle which moves continuously under the guidance of the wave [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "he applied his theory to a range of examples drawn from non - relativistic quantum mechanics and speculated on the possible alternations in the particle and field laws of motion such that the predictions of the modified theory continue to agree with those of sqm where this is tested , but it could disagree in as yet unexplored domains @xcite .",
    "for instance , when bohm presented his theory in 1952 , experiments could be done with an almost continuous beam of particles .",
    "thus , it was impossible to discriminate between the standard and the bohmian quantum mechanics ( bqm ) at the individual levels .",
    "in fact , the two theories can be discriminated at this level , because sqm is a probabilistic theory while bqm is a precisely defined and deterministic theory .    in this chapter , we have studied entangled and disentangled wave functions that can be imputed to a two - particle interference device , using a gaussian wave function as a real representation . then , sqm and bqm predictions are compared at both the individual and the statistical levels[29 - 30 ] .      consider the famous double - slit experiment .",
    "in the two - dimensional coordinate system , the centers of the two slits are located at @xmath160 . instead of the usual one - particle emitting source ,",
    "consider a special source @xmath68 , so that a pair of identical non - relativistic particles originate simultaneously from it .",
    "we assume that , the intensity of the beam is so low that at a time we have only a single pair of particles passing through the slits and the detection screen @xmath69 registers only those pairs of particles that reach it simultaneously , and so the interference effects of single particles will be eliminated . for mathematical simplicity , we avoid slits with sharp edges which produce the mathematical complexity of fresnel diffraction , i.e. , we assume that the slits have soft edges , so that the gaussian wave packets are produced along the @xmath33-direction , and that the plane wave along the @xmath57-axis remain unchanged @xcite .",
    "we take the time of the formation of the gaussian wave to be @xmath97 .",
    "then , the emerging wave packets from the slits @xmath64 and @xmath66 are respectively @xmath161}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\psi_{b}(x , y)=(2\\pi\\sigma_{0}^{2})^{-1/4}e^{-(y+y)^{2}/4\\sigma_{0}^{2}}e^{i[k_{x}x - k_{y}(y+y)]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the half - width of each slit . moreover at time @xmath28 we can write @xmath162}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\psi_{b}(x , y , t)=(2\\pi \\sigma_{t}^{2})^{-1/4}e^{-(y+y+\\hbar k_yt / m)^{2}/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}}e^{i[k_{x}x - k_{y}(y+y)-et/\\hbar]}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath163    concerning the two - particle source , in general , we can have two alternatives : + _ 1 . _",
    "the wave function describing the system ( the two emitted particles+double slit screen ) is so entangled that if one particle passes through the upper ( lower ) slit , the other particle must go through lower ( upper ) slit .",
    "in other words , the total momentum and the center of mass of the two particles in the @xmath33-direction is considered zero at the source .",
    "the wave function describing the system is not entangled . in other words ,",
    "the emission of each particle is done freely and the two particles can be considered independently .",
    "however , as a key point , the two correlated particles are still emitted simultaneously .",
    "+ in the following , we shall study each one of the two alternatives , separately , and explain sqm s predictions .",

    "[ fig21 ] .",
    "this differs from the prediction of sqm , as the probability relation ( [ p12 ] ) shows .",
    "sqm predicts that the probability of asymmetrical detection of the pair of particles can be different from zero in contrast to bqm s symmetrical prediction .",
    "furthermore , according to sqm s prediction , the probability of finding two particles at one side of the @xmath57-axis can be non - zero while it is shown that bqm forbids such events , provided that @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ fig21 ] shows one of the typical inconsistencies which can be considered at the individual level .",
    "based on bqm , bosonic and fermionic particles have the same results , but , we know that if one bosonic particle passes through the upper ( lower ) slit , it must detected on the upper ( lower ) side on the @xmath69 screen , due to relations ( [ v1pmv1 ] ) . instead , there is no such constraint on fermionic particles . if @xmath108 and we have a distributed source with @xmath179 , then for the conditions @xmath186 and @xmath125 , it is easy to show that the constraint @xmath187 still yields reasonable symmetrical detection around the @xmath57-axis on the screen .",

    "figure [ fig23 ] shows that according to bqm and under the conditions @xmath212 a considerable position change in the @xmath33-coordinate of the source produces a region with very low intensity on the screen which is not predicted by sqm .     and",

    "however , since the two particles in this scheme are emitted in a disentangled state , the results obtained may seem unbelievable .",
    "in this regard , struyve @xcite based on our aforementioned factorizable wave function ( [ psifactor ] ) , believes that the two independent particles of this experiment can not produce different predictions for sqm and bqm .",
    "he argues that @xcite , the results of the experiment will not be altered if we emit the two particles simultaneously or emit only one particle at a time , because the two particles are totally independent .",
    "but , it should be noted that , we can use the selective detection only when the source emits two identical particles at the same time , and if the source emits just one particle at each time , then it is meaningless to utilize our selective detection . in the following , once again , we substantiate our previous arguments about this thought experiment , in some details .    at first , we examine the applied condition @xmath124 , in a double - slit device with two disentangled particles .",
    "one may argue that this condition is meaningless , because based on the specifications of the set - up , y represents the distance between the center of each slit to the @xmath57-axis , and therefore , the minimum value of @xmath215 approaches @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is considered to be very small and represents the length of the plane that separates the two slits .",
    "but , this objection can be answered by considering the overlapping of each particle s two gaussian wave functions which are generated at the two near slits .",
    "the overlap causes the peak of each gaussian wave to approach more and more to the @xmath57-axis .",
    "in addition , under this condition , the gaussian wave functions lose their symmetrical form at each slit .",
    "our argument becomes clearer when we consider @xmath218 as a limiting case , i.e , we have only one slit . in this limiting case , it is clear that @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , when the two slits are very near together , the peak of gaussian wave functions , i.e. @xmath215 , come very near to the @xmath57-axis and the condition @xmath124 is completely satisfied .",
    "another problem can arise when one thinks of the two independent particles . to handle this problem ,",
    "let us reconsider the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ydot2 ] ) , particularly the coefficient @xmath220 . using the gaussian wave ( [ psiabt2 ] ) and the condition @xmath193",
    ", the latter coefficient can be written in the form @xmath221\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath222 .",
    "if we require that @xmath223 , i.e. , the @xmath33-component of the two particles are entangled , then we would obtain the equation of motion ( [ y(t)21 ] ) , as expected .",
    "but our two particles in this scheme are initially disentangled , and it is not necessary to have @xmath223 .",
    "instead , we can have another choice on the geometry of the two - slit set - up .",
    "in fact , if we apply the condition @xmath124 , again the behavior of the equation of motion of the two particles in the @xmath33-direction is similar to the motion of the two entangled particles , while the two particles were disentangled .",
    "hence , we can state that the classical interaction of the wave function of the two disentangled particles with the two - slit plane barrier for the condition @xmath124 , results in a wave function which now guides the @xmath33-component of the center of mass of the two apparently disentangled particles in the same way as the case of two entangled particles with the initial condition @xmath224 , for those pairs of particles that pass through the two slits .",
    "thus , we have shown that the results obtained in the two - slit device , using two synchronized identical particles along with the selective detection , are completely different from the ones obtained in a single - particle double - slit experiment .",
    "in fact , it seems that the motion of either particle is now dependent on its own location and the location of the other particle , although the apparent form of the wave function of the system can be efficiently represented by the use of the disentangled form in ( [ psifactor ] ) . based on qeh , the factorizable wave function ( [ psifactor ] ) results that both sqm and bqm must yield the same interference pattern for the whole particle arrived on the screen .",
    "but , one can see that this is not true for our specified conditions in which we have used a selective detection .",
    "if we study the interference pattern without using selective detection , we must obtain the same results for the two theories .",
    "however , using selective detection along with the guidance condition , it is clear that not only the two theories do not have the same statistical predictions , but also bqm clarifies and illuminates sqm , as drr _",
    "@xcite said:_by selectively forgetting results we can dramatically alter the statistics of those that we have not forgotten .",

    "the suggested experiments consist of a two - slit interferometer with a special source which emits two identical non - relativistic particles , simultaneously .",
    "we have shown that , according to the characteristic of the source , our two - particle system can be described by two kinds of wave functions : the entangled and the disentangled wave functions . for the entangled case ,",

    ", the predictions of the two theories can be different at the individual level , too .",
    "again , the results of the two theories were the same at the ensemble level",
    ". however , the use of selective detection can dramatically alter the interference pattern , so that not only the statistical results of bqm do not agree with those of sqm , but bqm may also increase our predictive power .",
    "therefore , our suggested thought experiments provide examples for which the standard and bohmian quantum mechanics may yield different predictions .",
    "in 1982 feynman @xcite observed that certain quantum mechanical effects can not be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "this observation led to speculation that perhaps computation in general can be done more efficiently if it uses these quantum effects . but building quantum computers proved tricky , and as no one was sure how to use the quantum effects to speed up computation , the field developed slowly .",
    "it was not until 1994 , when shor @xcite surprised the world by describing a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring integers , that the field of quantum computing came into its own .",
    "this discovery prompted a flurry of activity , both among experimentalists trying to build quantum computers and theoreticians trying to find other quantum algorithms .",
    "additional interest in the subject has been created by the invention of quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite as well as , more recently , popular press @xcite accounts of experimental successes in quantum teleportation and the demonstration of a three - bit quantum computer .",
    "the concept of entanglement is the distinctive and responsible feature that allows quantum information to overcome some of the limitations posed by classical information , as exemplified by the new phenomena of teleportation , dense coding and key distribution which are explained in the following sections .",
    "in fact , entanglement leads to profound experimental consequences like non - local correlations : when two distantly apart parties alice and bob share , say , an epr pair , the measurement by alice on her state simultaneously determines the state on the bob side .",
    "apparently , this implies instant information transmission , in sharp contrast to einstein s relativity . however , to reconcile both facts we must notice that the only way bob has to know about his state ( without measuring it ) is by receiving a classical communication from alice , which does propagate no faster than the speed of light .",
    "classical information can also be sent through quantum channels : to transmit the word 10011 , it is enough that alice prepares 5 qubits in the states @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath226 , @xmath225 , @xmath225 , sends them to bob through the quantum channel , and bob measures each of them in the basis @xmath226 , @xmath225 .",
    "each qubit carries a cbit , and this is the most it can do in isolation .",
    "but , as theoretically proposed by bennett and wiesner @xcite , if alice and bob share beforehand an entangled state , then 2 cbits of information can be sent from alice to bob with a single qubit . as a matter of fact , entanglement is a computing resource that allows more efficient ways of coding information .",
    "assume , for instance , an entangled state of two photons .",
    "one of the photons goes to alice , the other one to bob .",
    "she performs one of the following operations on the polarization of her arriving photon : identity , flipping , change of @xmath227 in the relative phase , and the product of the last two .",
    "once this is done , she sends back the photon to bob , who measures in which of the four bell states the photon pair is .",
    "then , in this fashion we have been able to send 2 bits of information over one single particle with only 2 states , that is , by means of a qubit .",
    "it doubles what can be accomplished classically which results the name of quantum dense coding or super dense coding .",
    "moreover , if eve , as an eavesdropper , intercepts the qubit , she can not get from it alone any information . because , all the information lies in the entangled state , and bob possesses half of the pair .",
    "actually , alice has sent bob 2 qubits , but the first one long ago , as part of the initial entangled state .",
    "this fact has allowed them to communicate more efficiently , resorting to the entangled state they shared .",
    "dense coding is kind of the inverse process to teleportation . in the latter",
    "the communication of two cbits allows us to reproduce a qubit state , while in the former the communication of a qubit carries along two cbits of information .",
    "the following is a review of the dense coding protocol which is explained in @xcite .",
    "consider an epr source which supplies alice and bob with a two - particle state like @xmath228-barium borate produces : uv photons get disintegrated ( though with low probability ) in a pair of softer photons , with polarizations which in a certain geometric configuration are entangled . in that experiment",
    ", they managed to send @xmath229 cbits per qubit .",
    "in a recent experiment @xcite , in which the qubits are the spins of @xmath230h and @xmath231c in a clorophorm molecule @xmath231chcl@xmath232 marked with @xmath231c , and rmn techniques are employed to initialize , manipulate and read out the spins , the authors claim to have reached the 2 cbits per qubit .",
    "the initial preparation of the entangled pair and the posterior transmission of the information qubit may have opposite senses ; for example , bob sends to alice one half of the entangled state , keeping the other half for himself , and then alice uses her qubit to send to bob the desired information .",
    "this may be of interest if the cost in the transmission in one way is higher than in the reverse way .",
    "on the other hand , intercepting the message from alice to bob does not provide any information to eve , because the message is entangled with the part of the epr pair possessed by bob .",
    "therefore it is automatically a secure emission of information ( except if eve intercepts both the original pair and the message and she replaces them ) .",
    "copying classical states has never posed unsurmountable difficulties to experts .",
    "it suffices to thoroughfully observe the original as much as it may be required , avoiding to damage it , to retrieve the information needed to make a copy of it .",
    "this careful observation does not alter , in a noticeable way , its state .",
    "but if the original to be reproduced is a quantum system in an unknown state @xmath10 , then any measurement ( incompatible with @xmath233 ) made on the system to get information on @xmath10 will disturb , uncontrollably , the state destroying the original .",
    "moreover , even in the case of having an unlimited number of copies of that state , infinitely many measurements will be necessary to determine that unknown state .",
    "for example , assume that alice has one spin-@xmath234 ) particle as a qubit in a pure state .",
    "bob needs it , but alice does not have any quantum channel to transmit it to him . if alice knows the precise state of her qubit ( for example , if she knows that her spin-@xmath234 is oriented in the direction @xmath235 ) , it is enough for her to give bob in a letter ( classical channel ) that information ( the components of @xmath236 ) to enable him preparing a qubit exactly equal to alice s .",
    "but if she happens not to know the state , she may choose to confess it to bob , who would then be inevitably driven to prepare his qubit in a random way , obtaining a 50% fidelity on average .",
    "but alice can also try to be more cooperative , making for example a measurement on her qubit of @xmath237 , with @xmath238 arbitrarily chosen , and then transmitting to bob both the components of @xmath238 and the result @xmath239 thus obtained .",
    "armed with this information , bob can prepare his qubit in the state @xmath240 the average fidelity so obtained is larger than before : 2/3 .",
    "however , it is not still enough .",
    "if alice and bob share an epr pair , there exists a protocol known as quantum teleportation , devised by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite in 1993 , which resorts to the quantum entanglement of states , and the non - locality of quantum mechanics allows bob to reproduce alice s unknown quantum state with the assistance of only 2 cbits of information sent by alice to bob through a classical channel .",
    "this procedure necessarily destroys alice s state ( otherwise it would violate the quantum no - cloning theorem ) .",
    "the following is a description of the teleportation scheme as explained in @xcite .",
    "assume that alice likes to teleport a qubit with the following quantum state @xmath241 in which @xmath242 in addition , consider @xmath243 be the epr state shared between alice and bob , with alice having the first of its qubits , and bob the second .",
    "the initial state is thus @xmath244 , of which alice can locally manipulate its two first bits and bob the third one .",
    "_ alice applies to the initial state the unitary operator @xmath245 acting with the cnot gate on the first two qubits and next with the hadamard unitary gate h on the first one .",
    "the resulting state is @xmath246    _ step 2 . _",
    "alice then measures the first two qubits , obtaining @xmath247 , or @xmath248 equiprobably .",
    "of alice s two qubits with the states of bob s qubit .",
    "it suffices to note that @xmath249 ]    alice lets bob know the result thus obtained , sending him two cbits : the pair of binary digits 00 , 01 , 10 , 11 that characterizes it . as a byproduct of alice s measurement , the first bit ceases to be in the original state @xmath250 , while the third qubit gets projected onto @xmath251 , respectively .",
    "_ once bob receives the classical information sent by alice , he just needs to apply on his qubit the corresponding gate i , @xmath252 , in order to drive it to the desired state @xmath250 .",
    "notice that this teleportation sends an unknown quantum state from one place ( where it vanishes ) to another place ( where it shows up ) without really traversing the intermediate space .",
    "it does not violates causality , though . in the first part of the process",
    ", quantum correlations get established between the bell states obtained by alice and the associated states of bob s qubit . in the remaining part to conclude the teleportation , information is transmitted by classical means , in the standard non - superluminal fashion .",
    "notice also that in this `` noncorporeal '' process , it is the information about the quantum state , the qubit , and not the physical state itself , what gets passed from alice to bob .",
    "there has been no transportation whatsoever of matter , energy or information at a speed larger than the speed of light .",
    "it is nevertheless surprising in the quantum teleportation that all the information needed to reproduce the state @xmath253 ( information that is infinite for it requires to fix a point @xmath254 on the bloch sphere with infinite precision , thus requiring infinitely many qubits ) , can be accomplished with only 2 cbits , provided an epr state is shared .",
    "this state , by itself , only generates potentially an infinite number of random and correlated bit pairs .",
    "quantum teleportation was realized experimentally with photons for the first time in two laboratories @xcite .",
    "this is at least what these authors claim , although several criticisms have been raised [ 48 - 50 ] ( see however @xcite ) . in the experiment by the roma group @xcite , the initial state",
    "to be teleported from alice to bob was a photon polarization , but not an arbitrary one , because it coincided with that of the alice s photon in the shared epr photon pair .",
    "in the experiment by the innsbruck group @xcite , however , the teleported state was arbitrary .",
    "teleportation was reached with a high fidelity of @xmath255 , corresponding to the case in which alice measures her qubit and communicates the result to bob classically . ] but with a reduced efficiency ( a 25% of cases ) .",
    "teleportation has also been realized for states which are parts of entangled states @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that quantum teleportation of states of infinite dimensional systems , namely , the teleportation of coherent optical states leaning on pairs of epr squeezed states , which is theoretically proposed by braunstein ana kimble @xcite , is realized experimentally by furasawa _",
    "_ @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "whose fidelity is @xmath256 ( higher than the maximum @xmath234 expected without resorting to entanglement ) , a third party , the _ verifier _ victor , supplies alice with one state that is known to him , but not to her .",
    "after teleporting that state from alice to bob , victor verifies on the output if bob s state is similar to the one he provided to alice .",
    "in this sense , this experiment is different from all the others , and led the authors to claim priority in the realization of teleportation .    it does not seem to be easy to implement the theoretical protocol with a 100% effectiveness .",
    "the bell operator ( which distinguishes among the four bell states of 2 qubits ) can not be measured unless both qubits interact appreciably with each other ( as it occurs with the cnot gate used in the protocol explained above ) , something which is very hard to achieve with photons . however , with atoms in em cavities the hopes are high .",
    "perhaps the most realistic application of quantum teleportation outside of pure physics research is in the field of quantum computation .",
    "in fact , quantum teleportation , which doubtlessly will be extended to entangled states from different kinds of systems ( photons and atoms , ions and phonons , etc . ) , might have , in the future , remarkable applications for quantum computers and in computer networks ( for example , combined with prior distillation of good epr pairs ) , as well as in the production of quantum memory records by means of teleportation of information on systems such as photons to other systems as trapped and well - isolated ions in cavities @xcite .",
    "a quantum computer can work on superposition of many different inputs at once .",
    "for instance , it can run at algorithm simultaneously on one million inputs , using only as many qubits as a conventional computer would need bits to run the algorithm once on a single input .",
    "theorists have proved that some algorithms running on quantum computers can solve certain problems faster ( i.e. , in fewer computational steps ) than any known algorithm running on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "the problems include , for example , factoring large numbers , which is of great interest for breaking secret codes , and searching for items in a database .",
    "so far only the most basic elements of quantum computers have been built : logic gates that can process one or two qubits @xcite .",
    "the realization of even a small scale quantum computer is still far away .",
    "a key problem is transferring quantum data reliably between different logic gates or processors , whether within a single quantum computer or across quantum networks .",
    "quantum teleportation is one solution . in fact , gottesman and chuang @xcite recently proved that a general quantum computer can be built out of three basic components : entangled particles , quantum teleporters , and gates that operate on a single qubit at a time .",
    "this result provides a systematic way to construct two - qubit gates .",
    "the trick of building a two - qubit gate from a teleporter is to teleport two qubits from the gate s input to its output , using carefully modified entangled pairs .",
    "the entangled pairs are modified in just such a way that the gate s output receives the appropriately processed qubits . performing quantum logic on two unknown qubits",
    "is thus reduced to the tasks of preparing specific predefined entangled states and teleporting .",
    "meantime , the complete bell state measurement needed to teleport 100% efficiency is itself a type of two - qubit processing .",
    "teleportation of complicate objects can be also considered as an interesting and dreamy subject which one can think about @xcite .",
    "can we really hope to teleport complicated objects ?",
    "it seems that , concerning this , there are many severe obstacles . for instance",
    ", the object has to be in a pure quantum state , and such states are very fragile .",
    "photons do not interact with environment much , so our experiments can be done in the open space , but experiments with atoms and larger objects must be done in a isolated vacuum to avoid interactions with gas molecules and environments .",
    "in addition , the larger an object becomes , the easier it is to disturb its quantum state - even by thermal radiation from the walls of the apparatus .",
    "this is why we do not routinely see quantum effects in our everyday world .",
    "quantum interference , an easier effect to produce than entanglement or teleportation , has been demonstrated with buckyballs , sphere made of 60 carbon atoms .",
    "such work will proceed to larger objects , perhaps even small viruses , but we might not expect to continue this for much larger objects .",
    "other problems is due to finding proper procedures for teleporting all desired kinds of objects .",
    "foe example , it has not yet been proposed a realizable scheme to make possible teleportation of the spatial wave function of an object - even a particle .",
    "also , the bell state measurement is an obstacle .",
    "in addition to some experimental difficulties relating to this kind of measurement , what would it mean to do a bell state measurement of , e.g. , a virus consisting of about @xmath257 atoms ? clearly it is a serious problem to extract the @xmath258 bits of information that such a measurement would generate .",
    "meantime , for an object of just a few grams the numbers become apparently impossible : @xmath259 bits of data .",
    "teleportation of more complicated objects particularly a person with @xmath260 bits of information can be considered as an exciting but perhaps a fictitious subject .",
    "being in the same quantum state does not seem necessary for being the same person .",
    "it seems that we change our quantum state all the time and remain the same people .",
    "conversely , identical twins or biological clones are not the same people , because they have different memories .",
    "so may be heisenberg uncertainty as well as quantum no - cloning theorem do not prohibit us from replicating a person precisely enough for him to think he was the same as the original .",
    "therefore , it seems that the teleportation of a person does not require quantum accuracy , and provides a surprising procedure for long travel , while the time for the person is frozen .    in the part two of this dissertation ,",
    "we have studied quantum dense coding in a spatial scheme resulting in more efficiency than some other well - known protocols , and also we have proposed a theoretical scheme which can provide position state teleportation of an object . to do this ,",
    "once again we have considered an entangled source between two parties which works very similar to that is used in our two double - slit scheme .",
    "the quantum entanglement property is providing new methods of information transfer , in some cases much more powerful than their classical counterparts . in quantum information theory , entanglement , as a key concept is used for a wide range of applications , such as quantum dense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , secret sharing @xcite and key distribution @xcite . to find more about the mentioned topics and the efforts done on them , both theoretically and experimentally , one can refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "quantum dense coding protocol was proposed originally by bennett and wiesner @xcite in 1992 .",
    "the protocol describes a way to transmit two bits of classical information through manipulation of only one of the entangled pair of spin-@xmath234 particles , while each of the pair individually could carry only one bit of classical information .",
    "the first experimental realization of dense coding has been reported by mattle _",
    "@xcite in 1996",
    ".    there have been attempts to generalize dense coding protocol to achieve higher channel capacity .",
    "the first proposition in this regard was due to the original reference of dense coding @xcite by using a pair of @xmath38-state particles prepared in a completely entangled state ( instead of an epr spin pair in a singlet state ) to encode @xmath261 values . in practice",
    ", there might be some limitations for finding @xmath38-state particles with high @xmath38 s and controlling them .",
    "very recently , some progress has been made in this direction @xcite , but it is still worthy , both theoretically and experimentally , to examine other alternatives for achieving this goal .",
    "for example , bose _",
    "@xcite studied @xmath262 pairwise entangled states in which each party gets one particle except bob with @xmath263 qubits .",
    "also in a more efficient scheme , they considered @xmath264 parties sharing maximally entangled qubits in a way that each party , including bob , possesses one qubit .",
    "moreover , some recent attempts on generalization of quantum dense coding can be found in [ 66 - 69 ] . in an elegant alternative ,",
    "vaidman @xcite proposed a method for utilizing canonical continuous variables @xmath57 ( position variable ) and @xmath58 ( linear momentum variable ) to perform a quantum communication . in this",
    "regard , braunstein and kimble @xcite presented a typical realization for continuous variable dense coding using the quadrature amplitudes of the electromagnetic fields in which the mean photon number in each channel should be considered very large .",
    "recently , in another way , some effort has been also done on experimental realization of continuous variables dense coding @xcite .    here",
    ", we have presented a theoretical extended version of dense coding protocol using entangled position state of two particles shared between two parties . in this",

    "this version , at large @xmath79 s , can be considered as a conceivable scheme for vaidman s idea @xcite except that we have considered just the position variable ( not both canonical variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) for communication .",
    "finally , the efficiency of our scheme is compared with some other known ones .",
    "consider an original epr source @xcite which emits a pair of identical ( fermionic or bosonic ) particles with vanishing total linear momentum , isotropically .",
    "many examples similar to this process can be found in different branches of physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , the molecule no can decay from an excited state to a state of two free atoms n and o which propagate in opposite directions , and in another example , the @xmath265 hyperon decays into a proton and a negatively charged @xmath227 meson . in our scheme ,",
    "the source @xmath25 is placed exactly in the middle of the two parties , ",
    "alice \" and  bob \" , where each one has an array of receivers aligned on a vertical line .",
    "the receivers just _ receive _ the particles and do not perform any destructive measurement .",
    "total number of the receivers of each party is considered to be @xmath266 . since alice and bob",
    "are assumed to be very far from each other and the source is considered isotropic , there is an equal probability for every receiver to obtain one of the emitted particles .",
    "we label the receivers placed at the upper ( lower ) part of the @xmath57-axis with positive ( negative ) integers ; 1 , 2 ,  , @xmath79 ( -1 , -2 ,  , @xmath267 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig41 ] shows an illustration of this scheme .",
    "now , the position state of the _ system _ ( the arrays + the source ) can be written in the form @xmath268 and @xmath269 are related to @xmath153 signs , respectively , and @xmath38 refers to label of the receivers .",
    "in addition , the order in writing the state is according to the direct product of alice s state and bob s .",

    "it is a relevant question to ask about how to implement @xmath297 operators in practice .",
    "so here , we propose one way of performing this task by using some basic and conceivable operators .",
    "for example , similar to pauli s operators in the spin-@xmath234 space , suitable basic unitary operators in the position space can be considered to be @xmath309 where the subscript @xmath38 means that the operator acts as a local gate on the @xmath310-th channels .",

    "the operation of @xmath314 gate can be easily conceived , for instance , by a kind of phase shifter , whose action can be represented as @xmath315 where @xmath316 is the conventional unit step function . to conceive this operator ,",
    "one can consider a typical switch gate acting on the @xmath317-th channel and its side channel , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig42 ] .",
    "if @xmath314 turned on ( off ) , then the direct ( side ) channel is closed and the side ( direct ) channel is opened .",

    "it means that direct ( side ) channels are closed and side ( direct ) channels are open ( closed )",

    "it is easy to check that the properties @xmath341 and also @xmath342 are satisfied . here , to make the former property consistent with our channel labelling it suffices , just as an example , to use the following convention : if in a ket like @xmath343 we have @xmath344 , then we should change @xmath136 to @xmath345 , and in the case of @xmath346 , to @xmath347 . moreover , in the following , we have shown that the grand unitary operator is also a reversible one .",
    "@xmath348    it can be argued that any general quantum physical process is required to operate by  finite means \" , i.e. , it is equipped only with the possibility of applying any operation of some finite fixed set of basic unitary operations @xcite .",
    "also , it is shown that various quite small collections of unitary operators ( so called  universal sets \" of operations ) suffice to approximate any unitary operation on any number of qubits to arbitrary accuracy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a recent work , bremner _",
    "@xcite showed that any unitary operation can be constructed using finite numbers of an arbitrary conditional operator .",
    "therefore , the grand unitary operator @xmath349 is constructible using some finite basic operators . in the following , as an example ,",
    "a realizable theoretical scheme for the bsm will be presented , using our introduced basic gates .      in this section ,",
    "we want to find an explicit form for @xmath350 operator based on the introduced basic operators . at first , bob needs one kind of logic gates to entangle two particles . the first presentation and demonstration of these kinds of gates , called cnot , was performed in 1995 by barenco _",
    "_ @xcite and monroe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively . here",
    ", we have considered another similar gate as a non - local operator which acts conditionally on the @xmath351 state as @xmath352 where pcs stands for position controlled swap operator and @xmath353 is the conventional unit step function .    to understand the action of this operator",
    "there is a way using four typical spin-@xmath234 cnot gates .",
    "figure [ fig45 ] shows a theoretical sketch of this construction .",
    "the @xmath354 is somehow a complement of the usual cnot in the sense that @xmath355 if a spin-@xmath234 particle passes through the control channel then the two first cnot and @xmath354 definitely change spin of an intermediate spin-@xmath234 particle , named spin target , which is preset to a fixed state , e.g. , @xmath226 .",
    "it is assumed that any change in the state describing the spin target means switching the swap gate for the channels @xmath45 and @xmath356 .",
    "the two latter cnot and @xmath354 are just to reset the spin target . to show this pcs gate in our quantum circuits , we adopt a simplified representation for it , as depicted in fig .  [ fig46 ] .",
    "our pcs gate can be realized using , for example , superconductor circuits .",
    "it is obvious that any change in the spin target results into a change in the magnetic flux passing through a superconductor circuit . for switching the swap gate",
    "the induced current can be amplified by a superconducting lc circuit in order to produce at least a critical magnetic field to set the direct ( side ) channel not superconducting ( superconducting ) .",
    "on the other hand , the same as the spin-@xmath234 case , bob can use hadamard operators in the position space with the form @xmath357 where @xmath358 is a local operator acting on the @xmath310-th channels . although the position hadamard operator has not a multiplicative form , but its design is relatively straightforward in our scheme .",
    "figure [ fig47 ] shows a schematic circuit for the hadamard gate acting on the @xmath38-th channel in which we have assumed that the probability of passing a particle through each basic gate is the same .",
    "in fact , in our scheme as an advantage , it is not necessary to find a multiplicative form to design such operators using the basic ones .",
    "gate.,width=226,height=68 ]    for @xmath359 cases , however , applying just pcs and @xmath358 operators does not produce pure position states in a disentangled and measurable form .",
    "so , we should introduce a non - local unitary operator for this mean which acts like @xmath360 where @xmath152 and @xmath45 are positive integers .",
    "moreover , here , @xmath361 is an element of an @xmath79-dimensional normalized symmetric hadamard matrix .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath362 , as we have shown in the following @xmath363    the same as @xmath297 operator , it is also possible to find an explicit form for @xmath364 operator based on the basic gates . here , for example",
    ", we have considered it as @xmath365l_{+}^{2n}\\nonumber\\\\ + l_{+}^{2n+1}\\otimes[\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(p_{i}n_{i}p_{i}n_{i})^{(h_{b , i}-h_{n-2n-1+i , i})/2}]l_{+}^{2n+1 } \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath366 is an element of an @xmath79-dimensional real symmetric hadamard matrix .",
    "in addition , the subscript @xmath367 is an arbitrary constant positive integer .",
    "this relatively complex form results from the generalization procedure introduced in appendix b. if we represent @xmath364 operator in the form @xmath368 then , in a similar manner used to design @xmath358 operator , it will be possible to conceive @xmath364 operator using the local operator @xmath369 which can be designed by the basic gates , and a nonlocal operator working like pcs gate , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig48 ] . here",
    ", we have assumed that each of bob s channels is divided into @xmath79 identical branches , so that the probability of entering the particle into each branch is the same .",
    "finally , each branch is joined to its correspondence channels in bob s lab .",
    "it should be noted that , the mechanism of the required conditional gate in this quantum circuit is the same as pcs gate , but it should turn on the @xmath370 gates ( instead of @xmath311 gate ) to operate @xmath371 on alice s particle .",
    "[ fig48 ]     operator for the @xmath38-th t - channel . here , each branch of the t - channel acts as a control channel for the @xmath370 gates applied on the c - channels.,width=377,height=181 ]    now , using the above mentioned operators , bob can perform his bsm in this way @xmath372 which should be followed by a position measurement on the outgoing channels .",
    "figure [ fig49 ] shows a schematic quantum circuit of bob s lab . in eq .",
    "( [ hexplicit ] ) , @xmath45 and @xmath38 are some unique functions of @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "in addition , action of the set of operators in this equation is equivalent to the action of the grand operator ( [ grand ] ) .",
    "we have seen that , there are @xmath288 bell basis and the same number of different unitary operators @xmath297 for encoding in our dense coding scheme .",
    "this obviously corresponds to encoding @xmath288 different messages by alice .",
    "thus , she can send @xmath373 bits of classical information per particle to bob .",
    "now , he needs @xmath79 pcs , @xmath266 hadamard and one @xmath364 gates to read out the sent classical information during the bsm . since bob performs one bsm on just two particles , it is possible to consider that all pcs and then all hadamard gates operate in a parallel form , i.e. _",
    "concurrently_. if the operation times for the pcs , hadamard and @xmath364 gates are @xmath374 , @xmath375 and @xmath376 , respectively , the rate of classical information gain r , defined as sent classical bits of information per unit time and sent particle , is @xmath377 in a similar way , one can calculate r for a dense coding protocol which works using @xmath263 pairwise entangled qubits and/or @xmath262 maximally entangled qubits shared between two parties @xcite . in the pairwise entangled case , @xmath378 classical bits of information are transferred from alice to bob .",
    "meantime , in this case , @xmath262 separate cnot and hadamard gates are required by bob to decode the bell states .",
    "thus , its r in terms of bits per unit time per sent particle is @xmath379 where @xmath380 is the operation time of a cnot gate .",
    "recently , however , lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite assert that the rate of information gain for this case is as high as @xmath381 bits per unit time . concerning this ,",
    "we have shown in appendix c that their claims are unfounded .",
    "on the other hand , for the maximally entangled case , the number of sent classical bits is @xmath262 . in this case",
    ", bob needs @xmath382 successive cnot and one hadamard gates so that he gains @xmath383}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] bits per time and particle .",
    "now , if we assume that both @xmath79 and @xmath263 are very large and all basic gates operate in an equal time interval , i.e. @xmath384 , then @xmath385 and @xmath386 . therefore",
    ", it can be easily seen that at large @xmath79 s , if @xmath387 is considered , i.e. dimensions of hilbert spaces are identical , then our protocol is more efficient than both the pairwise and the maximally entangled cases with a _",
    "logarithmic _ factor .",
    "furthermore , other degrees of freedom such as spin , polarization and squeezation can be added to our protocol in order to obtain a more powerful quantum dense coding .",
    "here , for instance , we consider that each particle can also have spin @xmath25 . to introduce spin , it is sufficient to assume that the source emits entangled pair of particles not only with vanishing total momentum but also with zero total spin",
    ". therefore , the quantum state of the system would be @xmath388 which is simply a tensor product of position and spin states of the system .",
    "therefore , now alice is capable of sending @xmath389 $ ] bits per particle .",
    "we have proposed a theoretical extended version of dense coding protocol by using entangled spatial states of the two particles shared between two parties .",
    "our construction is based on using the well known real symmetric hadamard matrix for representing orthogonal states , required encoding and decoding operators , and hence is subject to its intrinsic characteristics .",
    "furthermore , we have given a typical proposition for initial realization of the scheme .",
    "in this regard , some basic gates as well as a position conditional gate have been introduced and it is shown that whole of the scheme can be established based upon them . by comparing our scheme with some of the previously proposed multi - qubit protocols , it is shown that the rate of classical information gain in our case is better than them by a logarithmic factor .",
    "also we have shown that capability of considering internal degrees of freedom , like spin , strengthens the scheme in a straightforward manner .",
    "teleportation scheme proposed by bennett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is a protocol for disembodied transmission of an _ unknown _ quantum state of a spin-@xmath234 particle by a sender , alice , to a receiver , bob , by conveying two classical bits of information .",
    "in addition , the successful experimental realizations of this protocol , particularly for polarization states of photons @xcite , stimulated studying of teleportation protocol for more complex systems .",
    "for instance , extensions to @xmath79-dimensional hilbert spaces recently have attracted much attentions . in [ 83 - 86 ] an @xmath79-level source and in @xcite some two level epr sources",
    "have been utilized to accomplish @xmath79-level state teleportation . using the above entangled versions , it is theoretically possible to teleport any system with discretizable hilbert space .",
    "but , what about teleportation of position states of a quantum _ object _",
    ", @xmath390 ? the theoretical answer to this question was first provided by vaidman @xcite , utilizing perfect entanglement between position and momentum which results in a scheme for teleportation of continuous variables , or the wave function @xmath391 .",
    "interestingly , reliable teleportation of continuous variables is shown to be implementable in experiments .",
    "in fact , braunstein and kimble @xcite made a _",
    "proposal for teleportation of quantum state of a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "in other words , their scheme was a typical implementation of vaidman s method .",
    "then , experimental realization of braunstein - kimble method was performed by furasawa _",
    "but , it is believed that this type of experiment can not be expected to improve , due to difficulties in establishing highly squeezed light fields @xcite , and even in ideal experimental conditions , details of bob s reconstruction process results in an _ almost _ perfect replica of light fields @xcite .",
    "also , as vaidman pointed out , braunstein - kimble method is not applicable directly for teleporting @xmath392 , where @xmath393 is the spatial position of a quantum object @xcite . as a solution",
    ", vaidman proposed a way to overcome this disability by introducing a quantum - quantum interaction which can convert the continuous variable of a real position to the electromagnetic field amplitude variable .",
    "however , other methods or alternatives might be possible to solve this problem .    in this chapter",
    ", we have presented an alternate theoretical scheme to achieve realization of teleporting wave function @xmath394 of an object having spin . to do this",

    "some theoretical details on bell state measurement ( bsm ) and the reconstruction process have been illustrated in our novel spatial scheme .",
    "consider a theoretical set - up including two parties , alice and bob , who have labs which contain 2@xmath79-receiver arrays , as shown in fig .",
    "an epr source is placed in the center of the symmetry axis ( @xmath37-axis ) of the two receiver lines , which emits , _ isotropically _ , two identical _ maximally entangled _",
    "particles with vanishing total momentum .",
    "the receivers are labelled by @xmath395 , @xmath396 ,  , @xmath397 .",
    "we assume that they do not perform any destructive measurements on the received particles .",
    "all lines that connect each receiver to the related lab are representatives of quantum channels .",
    "each quantum object with an unknown state , as an initial import to alice s lab , is sent , after quantum scanning , to her lab to be combined with her own particle .",
    "then , she performs a bsm on her two particles . based upon the result of this measurement , she communicates with bob through a classical channel , sending related binary codes .",
    "bob , after receipt of alice s message , reconstructs the initial quantum state using his lab .      after this illustration ,",
    "it is possible to explain more details about the scheme for teleportation of quantum position state of an object . at the first step",
    ", we study the teleportation of one - dimensional position state of a spinless particle . in this case",

    "<S> in this thesis , we have proposed some novel thought experiments involving foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory , using quantum entanglement property . concerning foundations of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> we have suggested some typical systems including two correlated particles which can distinguish between the two famous theories of quantum mechanics , i.e. the standard and bohmian quantum mechanics , at the individual level of pair of particles . </S>",
    "<S> meantime , the two theories present the same predictions at the ensemble level of particles . regarding quantum information theory , </S>",
    "<S> two theoretical quantum communication schemes including quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation schemes have been proposed by using entangled spatial states of two epr particles shared between two parties . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the rate of classical information gain in our dense coding scheme is greater than some previously proposed multi - qubit protocols by a logarithmic factor dependent on the dimension of hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed teleportation scheme can provide a complete wave function teleportation of an object having other degrees of freedom in our three - dimensional space , for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> all required unitary operators which are necessary in our state preparation and bell state measurement processes are designed using symmetric normalized hadamard matrix , some basic gates and one typical conditional gate , which are introduced here for the first time .    </S>",
