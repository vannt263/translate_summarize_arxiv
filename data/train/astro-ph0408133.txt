    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are known to possess a variety of small - scale structures that are usually in a lower ionization state than the main body of the nebulae .",
    "the morphological and kinematic properties of these low - ionization structures ( liss , gonalves , corradi & mampaso , 2001 ) vary from type to type , in the sense that liss can appear in the form of pairs of knots , filaments , jets , and isolated features moving with velocities that either do not differ substantially from that of the ambient nebula , or instead move supersonically through the environment .    the total number of pne that are known to possess liss is 55 , i.e. about 10% of all the 527 galactic pne imaged in filters of high- and low - ionization emission lines ( balick 1987 ; schwarz , corradi & melnick 1992 ; manchado et al .",
    "the different types of liss may be easily seen in corradi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    at present",
    ", the origin of jets and pairs of knots in pne is not completely clear . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the principal physical process behind the formation of collimated liss is the interplay between the stellar agb and post - agb winds ( for single stars ) or between stellar and disk winds ( if the central star is binary ) .",
    "according to the various studies dedicated to this issue ( e.g. garca - segura  1997 ; garca - segura & lpez 2000 ; steffen , lpez & lim 2001 ; blackman , frank & welch 2001 ) jets and knots originated by this interplay are predicted to be supersonic , highly collimated and two - sided . in the case of single stars these",
    "are expected to be produced at the same time as the main pn shell , but in the case of a binary star origin they may be younger than the host pn . however , important properties of these liss such as density contrasts , the peculiar nitrogen abundance and main excitation mechanisms , appear hard to explain ( see dwarkadas & balick 1998 ; balick & frank 2002 ; gonalves et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "k  4 - 47 ( pn g149.0 + 04.4 ) is a compact pn that contains liss .",
    "it is composed by a small , high ionization nebular core and a pair of low - ionization , high - velocity knots , connected to the core by a much fainter low - ionization lane ( corradi et al .",
    "2000 ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "gonalves et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have proposed that the low - ionization lanes and knots of k  4 - 47 are genuine jets .",
    "their morphological and kinematical properties are explainable if the jets and knots were formed by accretion disks , attaining velocities of several hundred kilometers per second ( the main properties of these models are also summarized in gonalves et al .",
    "2001 and balick & frank  2002 ) .",
    "these highly supersonic velocities imply that the resulting liss are likely to be shock - excited .    k  4 - 47 is a poorly studied pn , for which statistical methods provide an unrealistic wide range of distances , for instance , 8.5  kpc ( cahn , kaler & stanghellini 1992 ) or 26  kpc ( van de steene & zijlstra 1994 ) .",
    "corradi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) computed a distance between 3  kpc and 7  kpc assuming that the object participates to the ordered rotation of the disk of the galaxy , but note that the relatively large height of k  4 - 47 on the galactic plane ( 0.54  kpc for a distance of 7  kpc ) adds some further uncertainty to this determination .",
    "tajitsu & tamura ( 1998 ) estimated a distance of 5.9  kpc using the integrated iras fluxes under the ( crude ) assumption of constant dust mass for all pne .",
    "lacking of anything better , we shall adopt in the following this distance of 5.9  kpc .",
    "lumsden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mapped the h@xmath0 emission from k  4 - 47 finding that it is excited by shocks .",
    "the object also appears in the 6  cm vla radio survey of aaquist & kwok ( 1990 ) showing a very compact radio core , with a diameter of 0.25 arcsec , and one of the largest brightness temperatures ( t@xmath1=8700 k ) found in pne .",
    "so far , the properties ( luminosity and temperature ) of its central star as well as its nebular ( physical and chemical ) properties are not known .    in this work ,",
    "we address the debated issue of the nature and origin of high - velocity liss , through the determination of the physical parameters , excitation and chemistry of k  4 - 47 .",
    "spectra of the core and the pair of knots are analyzed using two different models , which consider the gas to be either fully photoionized by the pn central star , or fully ionized by shocks .",
    "we will show that k  4 - 47 is particularly interesting for this study because , in contrast to most of the liss studied up to now ( dopita 1997 ; dwarkadas & balick 1998 ; miranda et al .",
    "2000 ; gonalves  2003 ; gonalves et al .  2003 ) , its pair of liss is mainly shock excited .",
    "spectra of k  4 - 47 were obtained on 2001 august 28 at the 2.5 m  isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma ( spain ) , using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) .",
    "the ids was used with the 235  mm camera and the r300v grating , providing a spectral coverage from 3650   to 7000   with a spectral reciprocal dispersion of 3.3   pix@xmath2 and a resolution of 6.9   .",

    "spectra were reduced and flux calibrated using the standard iraf package for long - slit spectra .",
    "line fluxes were measured separately for the three nebular regions indicated in figure  [ image ] , namely ,  and .",
    "the observed line fluxes are given in table  1 .",
    "errors in the fluxes were calculated taking into account the errors in the measurement of the fluxes , as well as systematic errors of the flux calibrations , background determination , and sky subtraction .",
    "the bottom lines of table  1 give the estimated accuracy of the measured fluxes for a range of line fluxes ( relative to ) in each of the regions .",
    "absolute  fluxes integrated along the slit in each region are as follows : f()@xmath6=2.41 ; f()@xmath7=2.76 ; and f()@xmath8=1.64 ( in units of @xmath9 erg @xmath10 s@xmath2 ) .",
    "figure  [ ratio ] shows the spatial profiles of low- to high - excitation oxygen emission lines (  6300 ,  ( 3726+3729 ) and  5007 ) ; we clearly see that the knots have a much lower excitation than the core . while the low - ionization profiles (  6300  and  ( 3726+3729 ) ) show local maxima at the positions of the knots , the  5007  profile presents its maxima in the core and does not peak at the knots .",
    "the average values of  6583/  at the knots are 2.0 ( ) and 2.1 ( ) , much higher than those usually found for spherical and elliptical pne ( e.g. , aller & czyzak 1983 ) , although such values are frequently found in the peimbert type i objects ( peimbert 1978 ; peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ) . the , on the other hand , has a less extreme  6583/  line ratio , 1.2 , even though still higher than in most pne . peculiar line ratios like those found in k  4 - 47 have been interpreted as indicative of the presence of shock - excitation or anomalous abundances ( see , for instance , miranda & solf 1992 ) .",
    "fluxes were extinction - corrected using  ( the logarithmic ratio between observed and dereddened  fluxes ) , determined from the observed /  and /h@xmath11 ratios , for each of the selected features of the nebula , and the reddening law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the derived  are : 1.26@xmath120.23 ( ) ; 1.37@xmath120.17 ( ) ; 1.11@xmath120.17 ( ) . the physical properties ( for all the nebular regions ) and chemical abundances of the",
    "were then evaluated assuming pure photoionization by the central star .",
    "we estimate the electron densities of k  4 - 47 , which are listed in table  1 , using the  6717/6731  line ratio .",
    "both knots are denser than the core ( 1900  @xmath13 ) by factors of 2.4 and 1.2 for  and , respectively .    adopting these densities ,",
    "electron temperatures are estimated using standard line ratios : @xmath14  is obtained from the  4959/4363  line ratio , which is appropriate to zones of medium to high excitation , and @xmath14  from  6583/5755 , representative of low - excitation regions . the @xmath14  for and the @xmath14  of",
    "the , are lower limits .",
    "we find that , within the errors and when both determinations are available , the two temperatures are similar .",
    "errors on @xmath14  at the position of the knots are significantly higher than those of the  temperatures simply because of the low - ionization nature of these regions .",
    "note that  is remarkably higher than the typical values for pne of around @xmath15  k ( kaler 1986 ) .",
    "figure  [ shockphot ] shows several diagnostic diagrams which are commonly used to distinguish photoionized nebulae from shock - excited objects , adapted from sabbadin , minello & bianchini ( 1977 ) and phillips & cuesta ( 1999 ) . in all of them ,",
    "the knots of k  4 - 47 are located close to the shock - excited zones while the core is displaced toward the locus where pne are usually found , i.e. photoionized objects .",
    "this suggests that shock - excitation plays an important role in the knots , but not in the core .",
    "the fact that in the  ( 4959+5007)/  _ vs. _  ( 6716+6731)/diagram  do not fall exactly within the  shock regime \" area is not against this interpretation , as its boundaries were originally computed for young stellar objects , using parameters ( gas abundances and shock velocities ) which can be different from those of evolved objects like k  4 - 47 .",
    "the large expansion velocities of the knots and their broadened line profiles ( corradi et al .",
    "2000 ) are also typical of shocked flows like h - h objects . in addition , the shock - excited nature of the knots would be consistent with their measured @xmath14 ( table 1 ) , unusually large for low - ionization microstructures in pne , and with their extremely high  6583/  line ratio . on the contrary ,",
    "the velocities observed in the core are substantially lower than in the knots , and so is its  6583/  line ratio .",
    "it is therefore suggested that the high velocity knots  and  of k  4 - 47 are mainly shock heated , while the  is mainly photoionized . with the aid of existing photoionization and shock modelling",
    "we will explore in the following these alternatives .",
    "ionic and total abundances for the  were computed using the ionization correction factors ( _ icf _ ) scheme , following kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) , as described in corradi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gonalves et al .",
    "results are shown in table  2 .",
    "note that as the @xmath14 in table  1 is only a lower limit , the abundances of the low - ionization ions are upper limits .",
    "errors on the total abundances are obtained by propagating the errors in the ionic abundances as well as on the _ icf _ , and are indicated within brackets in the table as percentage errors ( 14% for he , for which no _ icf _ is applied , and 3050% for o and",
    "n ) .    according to its large he and n / o abundances ,",
    "k  4 - 47 is similar to most bipolar pne ( perinotto & corradi 1998 ) , and would be classified as a type i pn ( peimbert & torres - peimber  1983 , see also kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) .",
    "however , the o , ne and s abundances of k  4 - 47 are among the lowest measured for galactic pne , and are more typical of some halo ( or type iv ) pne ( see e.g. howard , henry & mccartney 1997 ) .",
    "high he / h abundances ( 0.15 @xmath16 he / h @xmath16 0.20 ) , and some ( but much less extreme than in k  4 - 47 ) oxygen deficiency ( 1.35 @xmath16 o / h ( @xmath17 ) @xmath16 2.7 ) , were found in other bipolar pne , such as ngc 6302 ( pottasch & beintema 1999 ) , ngc  6537 and he  2 - 111 ( pottasch , beintema & feibelman 2000 ) . very much like in the case of k  4 - 47 , these pne have considerably high electron temperatures ( average @xmath14 , from optical , iso and iue spectra for the three of them are 17200  k up to 18300  k ) .",
    "therefore , we have the somewhat contradictory result that while k  4 - 47 seems to be an extreme bipolar pn in terms of its morphology and he and n abundances , its o , ne and s abundances rather resemble pne in the galactic halo , as its relatively large height on the galactic plane might also suggest ( see section 1 ) , and contrary to bipolar pne which are highly concentrated toward the galactic plane ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .    to further investigate these issues , in the next two sections we will model the  spectrum using , first , a shock excitation code , and , then , a pure photoionization model .",
    "shock models have successfully reproduced the emission line ratios , line profiles and , recently , velocity maps in hh objects ( beck et al .",
    "2004 ) . to check the possible influence of shock excitation on the spectrum we have explored a variety of steady plane - parallel models , for which we use the photoionization - shock code mappings ic ( dopita , binette & tuohy 1984 ; binette , dopita & tuohy 1985 ) .    one important characteristic of shock models is that the predicted spectra strongly depends on the preshock ionization .",
    "we have compiled a set of fully pre - ionized shock models ( i.e. the incident gas has been ionized ) and a set of local equlibrium preionization for the gas entering the shock ( as described by shull & mckee 1979 , hartigan et al .",
    "relative abundances typical of type i pne were assumed , and two values for the pre - shock density were considered ( 100 , 1000 @xmath13 ) . the input shock velocities were varied from 95 to 140 km s@xmath2 , i.e. the range producing large  ( 4959,5007)/ratios ( hartigan et al .",
    "1987 ) , as observed .",
    "note , however , that the measured expansion velocity of the  is smaller than 50(corradi et al .",
    "2000 ) , pointing to lower shock velocities .",
    "none of the predicted spectra could reproduce the large observed ratios of intermediate to high excitation emission lines with respect a h i balmer line ( i.e.  3727/ ,  5007/ , [ ne iii ]  3868/  and he ii  4686/ ) . moreover ,",
    "the shocked spectra predicted by our models imply  6300/  and  ( 6716+6731)/  larger than the observed values .",
    "a large discrepancy was also found with the observed  4959/4363emission line ratio , which is more than 2 times larger than the model values . and",
    ", finally ,  6583/5755  is very high , @xmath18 300 , because the intensity of  5755  is largely understimated by these models .",
    "we conclude that the plane - parallel shock models are not able to reproduce the spectrum of the core of k  4 - 47 .",
    "we have used the photoionization code cloudy 95.06 ( ferland et al . 1998 ) .",
    "cloudy needs as input the information on the shape and intensity of the radiation from the ionizing source , the chemical composition and geometry of the nebula , as well as its density and size . as mentioned in section  1 , the distance of k  4 - 47 , and thus its size and the luminosity of the central star , are poorly known .",
    "we adopt the distance of 5.9  kpc computed by tajitsu & tamura ( 1998 ) , although extending the calculations to the full range of distances from 3  kpc to 7  kpc proposed by corradi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    a spherical geometry , and a filling factor of 1.0 have been assumed . using the h@xmath19 and  images from corradi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) a core diameter of 1.9  arcsec was estimated ( 10% contour extension corrected for the finite resolution ; tylenda et al .",
    "the density was initially kept to constant and equal to its empirical value ( 1900  @xmath13 , see table  1 ) .",
    "however , as noted in the introduction , aaquist & kwok ( 1990 ) discovered a bright and very compact radio core at the centre of k  4 - 47 , implying a high density of 72000  @xmath13 ( assuming an optically thin nebula at 5 ghz , the distance of 5.9  kpc and following goudis 1982 ) .",
    "for this reason , models with much higher density values were also explored .",
    "dust grains have been included , since they have an important effect , particularly on the temperature structure of pne .",
    "this effect depends on the type of grain ( graphite and/or silicate ) , the grain abundances , and the grain - size distribution , being more relevant in the inner regions of the nebula ( see dopita & sutherland 2000 ) .",
    "both graphite and silicate grains were considered . as we do not know the grain size distribution and grain abundances for k  4 - 47 and more in general for pne , we adotped ism size distribution , with ism gas - phase depletions due to grains , following van hoof et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we adopted a blackbody spectrum for the central star , with derived from the ,  and  emission line ratios , using a modified zanstra method as done for instance by mikoajewska et al .",
    "this gives = 130000  k ( from  4686/ ) and = 115000  k ( from  4686/5876 ) .",
    "a lower limit to the central star luminosity comes from the iras spectral energy distribution ( tajitsu & tamura  1998 ) , which gives l@xmath20 16 d@xmath21  @xmath22 ( where d is the distance in kpc ) yielding 550 @xmath22 at 5.9  kpc .    as with the elemental abundances , we first run models with the empirical abundances given in table  2 , and subsequently with `` average '' values for either normal ( type - ii ) , or type - i pne , following kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) .",
    "cloudy models with the empirical abundances do not match the observed line fluxes .",
    "both helium and  ( 6548,6583 ) emission lines are largely overestimated , while oxygen , sulphur and neon lines are underestimated , mainly because the very low o / h , ne / h and s / h input abundances are not compensated by a high electron temperature in the model as empirically determined .",
    "tests with type - ii pne abundances were also not successful because the predicted  6548,6583intensities are very low , which is expected as the main difference between type - i and type - ii abundances is that the latter are depleted in nitrogen by a factor of @xmath234 ( kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) .",
    "assuming type - i abundances , we found a partial agreement with the observed spectrum for = 120000  k , l=550  @xmath22 and n@xmath24= 1900  @xmath13 .",
    "important optical lines like heii  4686 ,  ( 4959,5007 ) ,  ( 6548,6584 ) and  ( 6716,6731 ) are well reproduced by this model , with discrepancies of 10% or less .",
    "hei  4471 ,  6678 , heii  5412 , and [ s iii ]  6312  lines agree with the observed spectrum within 12% to 20% .",
    "other relatively intense lines such as  ( 3726+3729 ) , [ neiii ]  3868 , and hei  5876show discrepancies of 35% to 50% with respect to the model .",
    "furthermore , the model underestimates the intensities of the  4363  and the  5755  lines by a factor of about 3 .",
    "these lines are the keys for the determination of the electron temperature .",
    "finally , the model underestimates [ ni ]  5200  and [ oi ]  6300  by factors",
    "larger than 30 .",
    "let us note , in addition , that this model requires a size for the core of 4.0  arcsec , twice the optical size observed .",
    "it is then instructive to explore alternative scenarios .",
    "let us first note that in some pne and related objects ( see e.g. corradi 1995 ) , high  4363  and  5755  line intensities have been interpreted as the signature of very high core densities , as at @xmath25 larger than about 10@xmath26  @xmath13 the auroral (  4363  and  5755 ) to nebular (  4959  and  6583 ) line ratios are indicators of density rather than of temperature ( gurzadyan 1970 ) .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated other models assuming much higher ( albeit still constant ) densities .",
    "as noted above , high core densities are implied by the radio size and flux ( aaquist & kwok 1990 ) .",
    "cloudy models for the observed radio core size , 0.25  arcsec , and such high densities ( from 72000  k up to @xmath27@xmath13 ) show that both  4363  and  5755  intensities can be now reproduced , but other nebular lines , in particular  ( 3726+3729 ) ,  ( 6548,6583 ) , and  ( 6717,6731 ) , become now largely underestimated because of collisional quenching . a natural way to solve the problem might be to assume a strong density stratification in the core of k  4 - 47 , with a very dense inner zone where  4363  and  5755  are mostly formed , and a lower density outer region where other important nebular lines are produced .",
    "this idea should be tested by means of an appropriate photoionization model ; 3-d codes ( like mocassin ; ercolano et al .",
    "2003 ) are much better suited than cloudy to deal with such extreme density variations .    in summary",
    ", we find that none of the constant density models is able to account , simultaneouly , for all optical emission lines in the .",
    "in particular , the  4363  and  5755  intensities are strongly understimated if the nebular density is the one derived empirically from the  lines . a model with a strong density stratification could possibly offer a solution to the problem .",
    "the fact that we are not able to provide an accurate representation of the  spectrum , also prevents us to determine the radiation escaping from the core and reaching the knots , and thus to attempt a reliable photoionization modelling of the latter .",
    "a consistent photoionization modelling of the whole nebula ( core+knots ) would also require a fully 3-d modelling , that goes beyond the scopes of the present work .",
    "given the evidence that the knots might be excited by shocks ( section .",
    "3.2 ) , we instead attempt to describe their spectrum using existing shock models .      we have used the bow - shock models described in raga & bohm ( 1986 ) and hartigan et al . (",
    "we consider a bow shock with a functional form , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is measured along the symmetry axis , @xmath30 is the cylindrical radius , the parameter @xmath31 determines the shape of the bow shock and the constant @xmath32 determines its size ( beck et al .",
    "the emission from the bow - shock is modeled as described by hartigan et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , being the geometry of the bow shock the parameter that determines the shock velocity .",
    "the plane - paralel shock models required to predict the bow - shock emission line ratios are obtained with the photoionization - shock code mappings ic .",
    "we have adopted a pre - shock density of 400 @xmath13 , that is within the range generally assumed for stellar jets .",
    "the pre - shock magnetic field was taken to be negligible .",
    "we assumed elemental abundances for he , c , n , o , ne , s , and ar to be within the range of type - i pn values . as for the preionization of the gas , local equilibrium is assumed .",
    "we consider the bow - shock velocity as a free parameter , adopting a set of values from 50 to 300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we have obtained the best fit to the observed spectra for @xmath31=3 .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in figure  [ bshock ] for a number of emission line ratios plotted as a function of  6583/. note that the later line ratio increases in strength as the shock velocity increases , and in the case of k  4 - 47 is matched by only the largest shock velocities considered , somewhat larger than the estimate of 150  by corradi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "for these velocities , the bow - shock models fit pretty well the line ratios  ( 4069+4076)/(6717+6731)@xmath33  4072/6725 , and  6583/5755 , sensitive to the temperature in the recombination zone where  and  are formed , but not equally well the  4959/4363  ratio , indicating that the predicted electron temperature  is too large . the  and electron temperatures predicted by these models , for both knots , are 17800  k and 27600  k , respectively .    the ratios  6300/  and  ( 3726+3729)/  are also well reproduced .",
    "larger discrepancies appear for the helium lines hei  5876  and heii  4686 , and specially for [ ne iii ]  3868  and  5007  in , and  ( 6716+6731 ) and [ n i ]  5200  in both knots .",
    "note that a similar problem for the  ( 6717+6731)/  ratio is also found in hh objects ( raga et al .",
    "the large discrepancy for the [ n i ]  5200/  emission line ratio is intriguing , as strong line intensities for this ion can only be produced with low shock velocities , which could however not account for the observed flux of higher ionization stages like  6583 .",
    "different shock geometries , producing a different distribution of shock velocities , might help to solve this problem .",
    "also note that the bow - shock models are based on appraisal of what would be reasonable parameters for the knots of k  4 - 47 , and we did not intend to reproduce the line intensities separately for each of the knots .",
    "but the knots are not identical : in particular , high excitation lines like heii  4686 , [ ne iii ]  3868  and  5007  are much brighter in  than in , which indicates that the radiation field of the central star would affect the  emission line spectrum much more than that of .",
    "the observed spectra of  would also fit a model with a somewhat larger n / h abundance and a lower bow shock velocity .",
    "summarising , the analysis of the shock - excited knots suggests that they are high - velocity ( 250 to 300 ) condensations with high electron temperatures (  = 17800  k ) and chemical abundances similar to type - i pne .",

    "2002 ) and kj  pn  8 ( lpez , vzquez & rodrguez 1995 ) have , similarly to k  4 - 47 , a high electron temperature and the evidence for shock - excited liss . but note that in these pne , except for one of the m  2 - 48 s knots ( for which  is 20100  k , twice the core temperature ) , and  are not estimated in a detailed zone - by - zone basis , because  4363  and  5755  were not measured .",
    "the two distinct models that we used for the analysis of k  4 - 47 ( pure photoionization for the core and pure shock - excitation for the pair of knots ) , provide some clues for the interpretation of this nebula .",
    "first , the analysis of the core would suggests he and n overabundances typical of type - i ( galactic disk ) pne , but also an extreme oxygen deficiency which is instead more typical of pne in the galactic halo .",
    "these abundances calculation would however be invalidated if more detailed modelling proves the existence of a strong density stratification within the core , with an inner region with extremely high density ( @xmath34  @xmath13 ) , and an outer zone with a much lower density matching the empirical determination from the lines .",
    "in fact , in this case the  determined empirically using the  4959/4363  and  6583/5755  line ratios would be wrong , as the auroral and nebular lines involved would be formed in different regions .",
    "note that , albeit unusual , such high density cores were actually found in several other pne ( corradi 1995 ) , which like k  4 - 47 show an extreme degree of collimation .",
    "second , the knots seem to be mainly shock - excited",
    ". this conclusion is strenghtened by diagnostic line ratio diagrams , and , interestingly , by the fact that the h@xmath0 emission of k  4 - 47 is also shock - excited , contrary to most pne where instead it is excited by fluorescence ( lumsden et al .",
    "our shock modelling also indicates that knots have type - i abundances .",
    "according to these models , knots would move with space velocities of 250 - 300 , about twice the value estimated by corradi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from the analysis of the lines profiles .",
    "moreover , while the shock model is successful in matching the  ( 6583/5755 ) line ratio at the knots it underestimate their  ( 4959/4363 ) ratio by some 30% and 70% for  and , respectively .    as a final remark ,",
    "the two physical processes explored separately in this paper , i.e. photoionization and shock heating , are likely to be simultaneously present in a real nebula like k  4 - 47 , as gas can be ionized by both energetic photons from the central star and from the shocks associated with the observed supersonic outflows .",
    "taking this into account would require a sophisticated modelling which is not presently available , and which would also need to be supported by a better knowledge of the nebular and stellar parameters .",
    "in particular , very little information is presently known about the distance and the properties of the central star of k  4 - 47 , a basic data that could be addressed by future observations .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her comments , which helped us to improve the paper significantly .",
    "we also thank joanna mikoajewska for fruitful discussions and corrado giammanco for helping with cloudy .",
