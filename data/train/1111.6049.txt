    "the effective mass of the nucleon at saturation proved to be a very good parameter for obtaining large maximum masses . over the investigated range @xmath149 the maximum masses",
    "change about @xmath100 1.1@xmath96 .",
    "the most massive stars ( up to @xmath1502.9@xmath96 ) are obtained for low effective nucleon masses independently of the compression modulus , while for @xmath151 we can not reach the mass limit of 1.97@xmath60.04@xmath96 if the compression modulus is too low .",
    "for the hyperonic case , maximum masses varied from 2.0 - 2.1@xmath96 at @xmath123 to about 1.39 - 1.63@xmath96 at @xmath124 in the `` model @xmath29 '' , whereas in the `` model @xmath33 '' the variation is from 2.4 to 1.6 @xmath7 respectively .",
    "hyperonic neutron stars in the `` model @xmath29 '' are only compatible with the new pulsar mass constraint for low values of the effective nucleon mass @xmath131 mev , while within the `` model @xmath132 '' the mass constraint can only be achieved for @xmath133 mev .",
    "we conclude that the nuclear compression modulus at saturation might be a good indicator for the stiffness of the nuclear matter eos at low densities ( around saturation ) , but the maximum mass is much more sensitive to the effective nucleon mass at saturation .",
    "this result is in accordance with the fact that the high density behaviour of the eos in the rmf model is solely controlled by the effective nucleon mass at saturation density by virtue of the hugenholtz - van hove theorem @xcite . + as we have seen ,",
    "a 2@xmath96 star like psr j1614 - 2230 helps to constrain the nuclear matter eos . then a possible 2.4@xmath96 star - as has been recently suggested to exist @xcite - would pose even tighter constraints on the neutron star composition .",
    "should this measurement be confirmed , we could rule out many hadronic models ( e.g. tm1 or gm3 ) even in the limit of purely nucleonic stars .",
    "furthermore , in most such models the appearance of hyperons together with the use of su(6 ) relations for the vector coupling constants would then become impossible . in an associated paper @xcite , we further investigate the possibility of existence of hyperons in massive neutron stars , by questioning the assumption of su(6 ) symmetry for the determination of vector meson - hyperon couplings .",
