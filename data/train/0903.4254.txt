    "since it is rare to find a pair of biological species in nature which meet precise prey - dependence or ratio - dependence functional responses in predator - prey models , especially when predators have to search for food ( and therefore , have to share or compete for food ) , a more suitable general predator - prey theory should be based on the so - called ratio - dependent theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the theory may be stated as follows : the per capita predator growth rate should be a function of the ratio of prey to predator abundance , and so should be the so - called predator functional response .",
    "such cases are strongly supported by numerous field and laboratory experiments and observations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 the population densities of prey and predator at time @xmath3 respectively . then the ratio - dependent type predator - prey model with michaelis - menten type functional response",
    "is given as follows :    [ 1.1 ] & = & rn(1-)- , + & = & p ,    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are positive constants .",
    "in , @xmath6 denotes a mortality function of predator , and @xmath5 and @xmath7 the prey growth rate with intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity in the absence of predation , respectively , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are model - dependent constants .    from a formal point of view",
    ", this model looks very similar to the well - known michaelis - menten - holling predator - prey model :    [ 1.2 ] & = & rn(1-)- , + & = & p .",
    "indeed , the only difference between models ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) is that the parameter @xmath10 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath11 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "both terms @xmath11 and @xmath10 are proportional to the so - called searching time of the predator , namely , the time spent by each predator to find one prey .",
    "thus , in the michaelis - menten - holling model the searching time is assumed to be independent of predator density , while in the ratio - dependent michaelis - menten type model it is proportional to predator density ( _ i.e. _ , other predators strongly interfere ) .",
    "predators and preys are usually abundant in space with different densities at difference positions and they are diffusive .",
    "several papers have focused on the effect of diffusion which plays a crucial role in permanence and stability of population ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) . especially in @xcite the effect of variable dispersion rates on turing instability was extensively studied , and in @xcite the dynamics of ratio - dependent system has been analyzed in details with diffusion and delay terms included .",
    "cavani and farkas ( see @xcite ) have considered a modification of when a diffusion was introduced , yielding :    [ 1.3 ] & = & rn(1-)-+d_1,x(0,l),t>0 , + & = & p+d_2,x(0,l),t>0 ,    where the specific mortality of the predator is given by @xmath12 which depends on the quantity of predator . here ,",
    "the positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the minimal mortality and the limiting mortality of the predator , respectively . throughout the paper , the following natural condition @xmath15 will be assumed , and we will consider the case of the constant diffusivity , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the advantage of this model is that the predator mortality is neither a constant nor an unbounded function , but still it is increasing with the predator abundance . on the other hand , combining and ,",
    "many authors ( see @xcite , for instance ) have studied a more general model as follows :    & = & rn@xmath18-+d_1,x(0,l ) , t>0 , + & = & p+d_2,x(0,l ) , t>0 ,    with the specific mortality of the predator somewhat restricted in the form @xmath19 in this paper we consider a ratio - dependent reaction - diffusion predator - prey model with michaelis - menten type functional response and the specific mortality of the predator given by ( [ 1.4 ] ) instead of .",
    "we study the effect of the diffusion on the stability of the stationary solutions .",
    "also we explore under which parameter values turing instability can occur giving rise to non - uniform stationary solutions satisfying the following equations :    [ full1 ] & = & rn(1-)-+d_1,x(0,l),t>0 , + & = & p+d_2,x(0,l),t>0 ,    assuming that prey and predator are diffusing according to fick s law in the interval @xmath20.$ ] we are interested in the solutions @xmath21 fulfilling the neumann boundary conditions @xmath22 and initial conditions @xmath23for simplicity , we nondimensionalize the system ( [ full1 ] ) with the following scaling @xmath24 and letting @xmath25for the sake of simplification of notations , dropping tildes , the system takes the form    [ 2.1 ] & = & n(1-n)-+d_1,x(0,l),t>0 , + & = & p+d_2,x(0,l),t>0 .",
    "set @xmath26 where @xmath27.\\]]then the system with the boundary conditions takes the form @xmath28 clearly , in case the predator and prey are spatially homogeneous , the spatially constant solution @xmath29 of ( [ 2.3 ] ) , fulfilling the boundary conditions obviously , satisfies the kinetic system @xmath30",
    "in this section we will study the system ( [ 2.1 ] ) without diffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ ,    [ kinetic ] & = & n(1-n)- , + & = & p .    in particular , we will focus on the existence of equilibria and their local stability .",
    "this information will be crucial in the next section where we study the effect of the diffusion parameters on the stability of the steady states .",
    "the equilibria of the system ( [ kinetic ] ) are given by the solution of the following equations @xmath31the system has at least one equilibrium with positive values .",
