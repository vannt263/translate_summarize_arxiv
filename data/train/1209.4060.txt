    "it turns out that the change in the denominator is a good approximation for the calculation of the rate integrals and introduces an error of less than a few percent for astrophysically relevant temperatures and rate values .",

    "generally , larger errors appear at lower temperature .",
    "this results in astrophysical irrelevance of the errors in many cases because either the rates are too low ( especially for rates involving charged projectiles ) or the target nuclei in question are so short - lived that they will never be produced at low plasma temperature .",
    "the largest error found was between 50 and 100% for a few heavy nuclei at the driplines for proton- or @xmath70-capture at @xmath71 gk . for neutron captures , the errors when applying the standard approximation for the reverse rate were never larger than 10% at any investigated temperature , even at the driplines .",

    "as explained above , this is only sufficient for the determination of the stellar reactivity when the contribution @xmath40 of this level is close to unity .",
    "designing an experiment , it should be taken care to measure a reaction with the largest possible @xmath40 .",
    "this also implies that the reaction should be measured in the direction of largest @xmath40 . as derived above , this usually is the direction of positive @xmath0-value with some exceptions .",
    "for example , photodisintegration of g.s .",
    "nuclei always only provides a tiny fraction of the stellar rate ( see table [ tab : xphoto ] ) and thus can never be used to constrain a stellar rate for intermediate and heavy nuclei .",
    "the stellar rate can only be derived by combining the experimental data with theory when @xmath96 . in the past ,",

    "note that the renormalization factor is , of course , temperature - dependent .    since experimental cross sections are always given with a connected uncertainty ( an `` error bar '' ) and the ultimate goal of a measurement is to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the purely theoretical prediction , it is of particular interest to know the final uncertainty of the new stellar reactivity @xmath103 .",
    "it is evident that the new uncertainty will only be determined by the experimental one when @xmath40 is large .",
    "otherwise the experiment does not have much impact on the stellar reactivity and also not on its uncertainty .",
    "using @xmath40 , also the new uncertainty can be derived .",
    "first , the uncertainty of @xmath99 has to be calculated from the errors in the measured cross sections .",
    "it is convenient to use uncertainty factors as is the standard in astrophysical investigations .",
    "an uncertainty factor @xmath104 implies that the `` true '' value of @xmath99 is in the range @xmath105 .",
    "for example , an uncertainty of 20% translates into @xmath106 .",
    "secondly , the theoretical uncertainty factor @xmath107 of the stellar reactivity @xmath9 has to be estimated .",
    "the fundamental differences between error determinations in experiment and theory are discussed in @xcite and appropriate choices are suggested in @xcite .",
    "combining these errors leads to a new uncertainty factor @xmath108 for @xmath103 . here , @xmath109 is assumed because otherwise the measurement would not provide an improvement .",
    "obviously , also the uncertainty factor is temperature - dependent because at least @xmath40 depends on the plasma temperature .",
    "it is further possible to consider the uncertainty of @xmath40 in @xmath110 .",
    "its impact , however , is small with respect to the other experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the magnitude of the error scales inversely proportionally with the value of @xmath40 ( or generally @xmath34 ) , i.e. , @xmath111 has zero error as long as @xmath112 is known ( this is the case close to stability ) , and that the uncertainty factor @xmath113 of @xmath40 is given by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is an averaged uncertainty factor in the predicted _ ratios _ of the @xmath117 .",
    "these ratios are believed to be predicted with better accuracy than the rates themselves and so it can be assumed @xmath118 . in any case , the uncertainties are sufficiently small to preserve the magnitude of @xmath40 , i.e. , small @xmath40 remain small within errors and large @xmath40 remain large , as can also be seen in figures [ fig : excstates ] , [ fig:2p5comparison ] .",
    "it is sometimes stated that the @xmath1-process is the nucleosynthesis process with the best constrained nuclear input ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this statement , however , is based on the uncertainties in the measured ( n,@xmath42 ) cross sections .",

    "astrophysical @xmath1-process studies should consider that the rates can vary within the shown ranges and not only within the experimental errors .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations aiming at improved reaction rates for astrophysics should keep in mind that sometimes it is not necessary to know the rates for calculating the nucleosynthesis products .",
    "forward and reverse reactions occur simultaneously in a plasma . if the reactions in both directions are faster than the nucleosynthesis timescale ( the duration of the nuclear burning ) , then the number of nuclei of a given isotope will saturate to its equilibrium number .",
    "this number can be calculated using the reciprocity relations for stellar reactivities shown in section [ sec : forwrev ] .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : revrate ] ) , ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) it is trivial to show that @xmath120 when @xmath11,@xmath31 are particles , and @xmath121 for a reaction @xmath63 .",

    "the plasma density is denoted by @xmath132 , and @xmath133 is the mean number of electrons per baryon .",
    "note that reactions mediated by the weak interaction are not included in the equilibrium and therefore @xmath133 may be time - dependent .",
    "again , individual rates do not appear anymore in the above equations .    when all abundances in the network obey the above relations , full _ nuclear statistical equilibrium _",
    "( nse ) is achieved . in this case",
    ", no reaction rates have to be known .",
    "the relevant nuclear physics input is the binding energies and the weak interaction rates determining @xmath133 . in realistic cases ,",
    "more or less extended groups of nuclei are in statistical equilibrium and the relative abundances within a group can be described by equations similar to ( [ eq : nse ] ) .",
    "the different groups are connected by comparatively slow reactions not being in equilibrium , which determine the abundance level of one group with respect to another group .",
    "the rates of these slow , connecting reactions have to be known explicitly .",
    "this is called _ quasi - statistical equilibrium _ ( qse ) .",
    "it appears in various kinds of high - temperature burning , such as hydrostatic oxygen and silicon burning in massive stars @xcite and different explosive scenarios .",
    "proton captures are in equilibrium with ( @xmath42,p ) reactions within isotonic chains in the @xmath93- and @xmath134-processes @xcite .",
    "the slow reactions connecting different groups ( chains ) are @xmath135-decays and electron captures in the @xmath134-process and ( n , p ) reactions in the @xmath93-process . on the neutron - rich side of stability ,",
    "the ( n,@xmath42)-(@xmath42,n ) equilibrium of the @xmath136-process @xcite is a qse within isotopic chains and slower @xmath137-decays connect the chains @xcite .",
    "of course , individual rates of all involved reactions have to be known in order to determine under which conditions ( temperature , density ) the nuclei fall out of nse or qse .",
    "another situation , in which not all individual rates have to be known , is a sequence of reactions in which most of the reactions are much faster than one or a few slow ones . in this case , the matter processing along this chain is determined by the slow reactions and their reaction rates have the largest impact .",
    "when the process has lasted for a sufficient time to move through all the nuclei in a chain and the relative number of nuclei in the chain does not change anymore , this is called _ steady flow _ @xcite .",
    "steady flow considerations are helpful when investigating hydrostatic hydrogen burning of stars through the pp - chains and the cno cycles @xcite . in the past",
    "they have also been used for sequences of neutron captures in the @xmath1-process on nuclei in between magic numbers @xcite .",
    "the study of the sensitivities of reaction cross sections and astrophysical reactivities to variations in nuclear properties has proven essential in several respects .",
    "firstly , it is not always possible to cover the astrophysically relevant energy range in experimental investigations , especially for charged particle reactions on intermediate and heavy nuclei which show tiny reaction cross sections at low energy due to the high coulomb barriers .",
    "astrophysical reactivities as well as low - energy cross sections may have quite different sensitivities than cross section at higher energy .",
    "therefore great care has to be taken in comparisons of theory to experiment and in subsequently drawing conclusions on the ability of theory to predict astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "deviations from predictions found in experimental data above the astrophysical energies often turn out to be irrelevant for the rate predictions because they are caused by an insufficient theoretical description of a nuclear property which has no impact at low energy . on the other hand , they may also not be sufficient to constrain the actually relevant properties and thus add nothing to better constraining the reaction rate . in order to draw valid conclusions for astrophysics , experimental and theoretical studies of reaction",
    "cross sections have to consider the applicable sensitivities .",
    "as laid out in @xcite , the knowledge of sensitivities also allows to study uncertainties in the prediction of reaction rates .",
    "while the definition of an `` error bar '' for theory is complicated by some fundamental differences to attaching an experimental error ( see @xcite for details ) , properly defined sensitivities immediately allow to see the impact of various uncertainties in nuclear properties and input without having to perform the full variational calculations .",
    "this also implies that it is easy to see which properties are in need of a better description in order to better constrain the astrophysical rate .    in order to quantify the impact of a variation of a model quantity @xmath138 ( directly taken from input or derived from it ) on the final result @xmath139 ( which is either a cross section or a reactivity ) , the relative sensitivity @xmath140 is defined as @xcite @xmath141",

    "further information is encoded in the sign of the sensitivity @xmath1 . since both @xmath148 and @xmath149 for the quantities studied in this context",

    "sometimes also the nuclear level density is varied although it can be shown that it mainly affects the @xmath42-width in astrophysical applications .",
    "comparing the sensitivities of a cross section to variations of the @xmath42-widths and level density allows to further constrain an observed deviation of a prediction from data , provided the cross section is mainly sensitive to the @xmath42-width at the measured energy . as mentioned before , also",
    "the impact of uncertainties in the ( input ) quantities on the final rate or cross section can be studied using the relative sensitivities . when a quantity @xmath138 has an uncertainty factor @xmath154",
    ", it will appear as an uncertainty factor @xmath155 in the final result .",
    "it should be noted that laboratory cross sections @xmath55 exhibit different sensitivities in forward and reverse reactions , whereas it follows from the reciprocity relations ( [ eq : revrate ] ) , ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) that the sensitivities of the reaction rates are the same for forward and reverse reaction .",
    "it is also to be mentioned that even in the astrophysical energy range laboratory cross sections do not necessarily show the same sensitivity as the stellar rate .",
    "this depends on @xmath40 and/or the sensitivities of the transitions from excited states .",
    "usually the cross section in the reaction direction with larger @xmath40 will behave more similar to the stellar rate .    extended tables of sensitivities for reactions on target nuclei between the driplines and with @xmath41 have been published in @xcite , for rates as well as cross sections .",
    "here , only a few examples are discussed .",
    "figure [ fig : ruplot ] shows a striking example of how different sensitivities can be in the astrophysical energy range and above it . if a measurement of @xmath78ru(p,@xmath42)@xmath156rh showed discrepancies to predictions above , say , @xmath157 mev it would be hard to disentangle the uncertainties from different sources . moreover ,",
    "such a discrepancy would say nothing about the quality of the prediction at astrophysical energies , as the cross section is almost exclusively sensitive to the proton width there , whereas the proton width does not play a role at higher energy .",
    "obviously , if good agreement is found , on the other hand , between experiment and theory at higher energy , this does not constrain the uncertainty of the reaction rate .    as a general observation",
    "it was found that the @xmath42-width is not relevant in astrophysical charged particle captures on intermediate and heavy mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coulomb barrier suppresses the proton- and @xmath70-widths at low energy and makes them smaller than the @xmath42-widths at astrophysical interaction energies .",
    "the cross sections and rates will always be most sensitive to the channel with the smallest width .",
    "it also follows from this that whenever an @xmath70-particle is involved , the reaction will be mostly sensitive to its channel .",
    "the situation for neutron captures is more diverse . for neutron - rich nuclei",
    "the rates are strongly sensitive to the @xmath42-width . in between magic neutron numbers along stability and especially in the region of deformed nuclei , however , they are also or even more sensitive to the neutron - width ( see figures 14 , 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the compound nuclei in these regions have higher level densities and this leads to comparable sizes of the neutron- and @xmath42-widths at astrophysical energies .",
    "further examples regarding the application of sensitivity plots to the astrophysical interpretation of experimental data are found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "while reactions involving light target nuclei are dominated by few , easily identifyable transitions , the dependence of astrophysical reaction rates and cross sections is more complicated for intermediate and heavy mass nuclei .",
    "an overview of the important effects was given above .",
    "suggestions on how to implement the above results to improve our knowledge of astrophysical reaction rates have been given in @xcite .",
    "crucial for all experimental and theoretical investigations is the choice of nuclei , reactions , and nuclear properties of astrophysical relevance to study .",
    "this involves several considerations .",
    "firstly , not all nuclei and reactions appearing in a nucleosynthesis process are equally important .",
    "some may be rendered insignificant by full or partial equilibria ( section [ sec : equilibria ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the g.s .",
    "contributions @xmath40 to the stellar rate should also be considered when devising an experiment to judge whether a feasible measurement can actually constrain the stellar reaction rate , even when performed within the astrophysical energy range .",
    "a reaction should preferrably be measured in the direction of largest @xmath40 .",
    "the applicable energy ranges can be found in @xcite .",
    "if a measurement within this energy range is possible , the theoretical rate has to be corrected by the experimental data as explained in section [ sec : exp ] .",
    "this also assigns an improved uncertainty .",
    "a simple renormalization is not adequate , not even when @xmath111 at one temperature because of the temperature - dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "if a measurement is unfeasible at astrophysical energies , the sensitivities introduced in section [ sec : sensi ] have to be consulted to assess whether cross sections in the accessible energy range can help to constrain the rate . knowing the sensitivities , also alternative reactions or approaches may be sought to extract the actually important quantities required as input for the rate predictions .",
    "all in all , the procedures laid out here allow to focus experiment and theory on the study of the actually relevant nuclear reactions and properties .",
    "they provide a well - directed approach to a purposeful improvement of astrophysical reaction rates , necessary for the best and most economical use of existing and future experimental and computing facilities .",
