    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has been well known in a dilute gas @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic properties such as superconductivity and superfluidity in both @xmath0he and @xmath6he are understood in relation to bec .",
    "recently it has been speculated that the @xmath7(7.65 mev ) state of @xmath1c , the hoyle state , is a bose - einstein condensate of three @xmath5 particles @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite and kamimura and fukushima @xcite studied the @xmath5 cluster structure of @xmath1c thoroughly in the microscopic cluster model and showed that the @xmath7 state of @xmath1c , has a loosely coupled three @xmath5 cluster structure with an @xmath5@xmath8@xmath9be configuration .",
    "recently it has been shown that the wave functions of uegaki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and kamimura and fukushima @xcite are almost completely equivalent to the wave function of an @xmath5 particle condensate that the three @xmath5 particles are sitting in the lowest 0s state in a dilute gas .",
    "a macroscopic property that is peculiar to bec such as superconductivity and superfluidity has not been observed in the case of @xmath5 particle condensation .",
    "recently kokalova _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new experimental way of testing bec of @xmath5 particles in nuclei by directly observing the enhancement of @xmath5 particle emission and the multiplicity partition of the possible emitted @xmath5 particles .",
    "it is important to find a phenomenon which strongly reflects the properties of bose - einstein condensation of @xmath5 particles .",
    "we show that the dilute property of the matter density due to bose - einstein condensation can be seen in the nuclear refractive phenomena .",
    "nuclear rainbow scattering has been powerful in the study of nucleus - nucleus interaction when absorption is incomplete @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that rainbow scattering and the evolution of the airy minimum can also be seen in inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the refractive effect becomes much larger and can be seen clearly at low incident energies .",
    "recently a new concept of prerainbow has been proposed at the lower energy region @xcite .",
    "the refractive index @xmath10 is related to the optical potential @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12    there is no useful experimental data in inelastic @xmath5 particle scattering to the hoyle state in the low energy region .",
    "fortunately , for @xmath0he scattering from @xmath1c there is an experimental angular distribution at 34.7 mev measured by fujisawa _",
    "@xcite , which had been unnoticed for many years and to which no theoretical attention from the viewpoint of @xmath5 particle condensation in the hoyle state had been paid .",
    "[ comparison : fig1 ]    we study elastic and inelastic @xmath0he+@xmath1c scattering in the microscopic coupled channel method by taking into account simultaneously the 0@xmath13 ( 0.0 mev ) , @xmath2 ( 4.44 mev ) , 0@xmath3 ( 7.65 mev ) , and 3@xmath4 ( 9.63 mev ) states of @xmath1c .",
    "the diagonal and coupling potentials for the @xmath0he+@xmath1c system are calculated with the double folding model :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the ground state density of @xmath0he taken from cook _",
    "et al._@xcite , while @xmath16 denotes the density - dependent m3y effective interaction ( ddm3y ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 represents the diagonal ( @xmath18 ) or transition ( @xmath19 ) nucleon density of @xmath1c calculated in the resonating group method by kamimura _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the folding potential is very sensitive to the wave functions used , which serves as a good test of the validity of the wave function . in the analysis we introduce the normalization factor @xmath20 for the real part of the potential and phenomenological imaginary potentials with a wood - saxon form factor ( volume absorption ) and a derivative of the wood - saxon form factor ( surface absorption ) for each channel .",
    "in fig .  1 angular distributions calculated using a coupled channel method at @xmath21=34.7 mev and 72 mev are compared with the experimental data .",
    "the calculation reproduces the experimental angular distributions for the ground state and the hoyle state as well as the @xmath2 and 3@xmath4 states @xcite .    by decomposing the calculated scattering amplitude into farside and nearside contributions ,",
    "the airy minimum of the rainbow at 72 mev and the prerainbow oscillations at 34.7 mev for the hoyle state is identified . at @xmath21=72",
    "mev the first airy minimum @xmath22 appears at 35@xmath23 for the @xmath24 state . for elastic scattering a clear minimum is not seen in the angular distribution of the farside cross sections and the airy minimum in the experimental data is obscured by the interference between the farside and nearside amplitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath22 minimum for the 0@xmath3 state is clearly seen in the farside cross sections because the minimum is shifted to a larger angle where the nearside contribution is much smaller .",
    "the situation is more clearly seen in the airy structure at low the incident energy region where no typical rainbow falloff of the dark side appears . at @xmath21= 34.7",
    "mev in fig .  1",
    "the airy minimum @xmath22 appears at 60@xmath23 for elastic scattering and 75@xmath23 for the 0@xmath3 state .",
    "the latter is much shifted to a larger angle and the airy minimum is not at all obscured by the nearside contributions .",
    "for the 0@xmath3 state at @xmath21= 34.7 the nearside contributions are much smaller than the farside contributions compared with the elastic scattering case .",
    "thus the difference of the refraction between the ground state and the 0@xmath3 state is much more clearly seen in the prerainbow oscillations at 34.7 mev than in the rainbow at 72 mev .",
    "this shows that the incident @xmath0he is strongly refracted in the hoyle state in accordance with the previous finding in @xmath5+@xmath1c scattering @xcite that the state has a large lens composed of three @xmath5 particles in a dilute density distribution .",
    "[ coupling : fig2 ]    [ partial : fig3 ]    in fig .",
    "2 the coupling potentials for the g.s.-2@xmath13 and g.s.- @xmath24 channels are compared .",
    "it is clear that the coupling potential for the g.s.-@xmath24 channel is considerably extended to the outer region , which enhances the inelastic scattering to the hoyle state in the surface region .",
    "in fact , in fig .  3 we see that even at the low energy region where so many high partial waves are not involved , inelastic scattering to the hoyle state occurs at large angular momenta ( that is , large radius ) compared with that to the normal g.s . and 2@xmath13 states .",
    "this becomes clearer at the high energy region as was discussed in @xmath5 particle scattering from @xmath1c at @xmath21=139 mev @xcite .",
    "these facts are in accordance with the previous finding that the hoyle state has a large radius compared with the normal ground state .",
    "we have shown that the prerainbow oscillation is useful for studying the dilute density distribution due to bose - einstein condensation of @xmath5 particles .",
    "the present approach is applicable not only to @xmath0he scattering but also to heavy ion rainbow scattering .",
    "the @xmath25o+@xmath1c rainbow and prerainbow scattering will be useful to reconfirm the present conclusions because the refractive effect is very strong and clear airy minima of higher order can be expected .",
    "it has been also suggested that the @xmath26(8.86 mev ) state in @xmath27c , the @xmath28(9.746 mev ) state in @xmath29c and the @xmath28 ( @xmath3029 mev ) state in @xmath25c may be a state with one , two and four additional neutrons to the 0@xmath3 state of @xmath1c . if the above states have a dilute density distribution , the prerainbow oscillations for these states would be considerably different from a state with a normal density distribution .",
    "this kind of experiment is highly desired .",
