    "ngc  3079 is a highly - inclined ( @xmath4 ) edge - on spiral galaxy at a distance of 15.6 mpc , the optical disk of which has a position angle of @xmath5 ( irwin & seaquist 1991 ; sofue & irwin 1992 ) . the nucleus of ngc  3079 is classified as a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; heckman 1980 ) or seyfert 2 ( ford et al .",
    "the galaxy is known to have an ultra - high - density molecular core ( @xmath6 ) in the center ( sofue et al .",
    "in addition , molecular gas with a total mass of @xmath7 is contained within the central 2 kpc radius ( koda et al .",
    "the nucleus shows very bright @xmath8 emission , which is one of the most luminous @xmath8 maser sources ( henkel et al .",

    "1986 ; cecil et al . 2001 ; x - ray : fabbiano et al .",
    "the superbubbles may have been produced by either a central active galactic nucleus ( agn , i.e. acretion of dense gas into the core ; irwin & seaquist 1988 ; hawarden et al .",
    "1995 ) or a nuclear starburst ( sofue & vogler 2001 ) , but the exact origin is yet to be understood .",
    "infrared ( ir ) imaging observations of ngc  3079 are relatively few , in contrast to other wavelengths , mainly due to low spatial resolution especially in the far - ir .",
    "ir observations however provide very important tools to study dust components that trace star formation activities effectively .",

    "1991 ) and therefore iras and iso could not observe the galaxy as a spatially resolved far - ir source .",
    "klaas & walker ( 2002 ) derived the dust - to - gas mass ratio of 200 for the whole galaxy of ngc  3079 , which is close to the accepted value of 100200 for our galaxy ( sodroski et al .",

    "the strong pah emission suggests that the central activity of ngc  3079 is better characterized by a nuclear starburst rather than an agn .    in this paper , we present multi - band images of ngc  3079 in the near- to far - ir obtained by the akari satellite ( murakami et al .",

    "we present non - saturated images as well as new maps at 11 @xmath3 and 15 @xmath3 , although the spatial resolutions are slightly worse than spitzer due to the smaller diameter of the akari telescope ( 68.5 cm ; kaneda et al .",

    "neutral pahs emit mcuh less in the 68 @xmath3 ( joblin et al .",

    "hence the ratio of the @xmath13 to the @xmath14 band intensity increases with the ionization degree of pahs ( draine & li 2007 ) . the mid - ir seds in figure [ fig : sed ] suggest that pahs are highly ionized and radiation field is strong in the center of ngc  3079 as compared to those in the disk regions .",
    "the far - ir seds in figure [ fig : sed ] also indicate that a dust temperature is higher in the center than in the disk regions .",
    "hence the mid- and far - ir seds consistently suggest that star formation is relatively active in the central region of ngc  3079 .",

    "the model considerably overestimates the submillimeter 450 , 850 , and 1220 @xmath3 flux densities of the whole galaxy , which might reflect that the power - law index @xmath22 has a reasonable tendency to increase toward longer wavelengths ( e.g. hildebrand 1983 ) .",

    "the images in figure [ fig:10bands ] suggest that pahs in the disk emit in the @xmath14 band strongly relative to the @xmath13 band as compared to pahs in the center .",

    "figure [ fig : hi ] reveals two prominent characteristics ; a high @xmath13/@xmath14 ratio in the nucleus and asymmetry in @xmath13/@xmath14 ratio with respect to the disk .",
    "the high @xmath13/@xmath14 ratio in the nucleus supports that ionized pahs are dominant and thus radiation field is strong in the nucleus . along the disk",
    ", there are at least three spots showing relatively high @xmath13/@xmath14 ratios , which are located at the edge of the arms .",
    "the high spots located at the diagonal positions by off the center are probably due to artifacts originating from the psfs ( i.e. diffraction patterns of the telescope ) .",
    "the ratio is systematically high on the eastern side of the galaxy with respect to the edge - on disk .",
    "this asymmetry might be attributed to the extinction by extraplanar dust , especially silicate grains that have absorption features around 10 @xmath3 , i.e. larger extinction in the @xmath14 band and thus higher @xmath13/@xmath14 ratios on the eastern side of the galaxy .",
    "this situation is consistent with the known configuration of ngc  3079 that the galaxy is highly inclined and the eastern side of the galaxy is far from us ( koda et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "( 60mm,)fig6.eps      the @xmath16 image in figure [ fig:10bands ] shows an extended structure in the center .",
    "the structure is likely related to the activity and kilo - parsec - scale outflows of the galactic center , which were reported previously in h@xmath9 and x - rays ( e.g. cecil et al .",
    "we compare the central image of ngc  3079 to the psf in the @xmath16 band that is obtained from an isolated star in a globular cluster 47 tuc ( observation i d : 1700001 , 1700002 ) by evaluating the cutting profile along the minor axis of ngc  3079 with a width of ( figure [ fig:47tuc ] ) .",
    "the images are normalized to the peak values and aligned in the instrumental pixel coordinates .",
    "figure [ fig:47tuc ] reveals that there is excess above the psf up to , which corresponds to the physical size of @xmath2 1.5 kpc , similar to the scale of the h@xmath9/x - ray outflow .",
    "the extended component occupies @xmath220 % of the @xmath16 band total flux in the central 4 kpc region .",
    "since this size is by far larger than a typical size of a molecular torus around an agn , 1 - 100 pc , the extended hot dust component seems to be not of an agn torus origin .",
    "we also show the cutting profile obtained for the @xmath13 band image in figure [ fig:47tuc ] .",
    "as compared to the @xmath16 band , excess above the outskirts of the psf is quite small .",
    "similarly , the excess is relatively small in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "hence the hot dust responsible for the @xmath16 band emission is more extended than the pahs responsible for the s7 band emission , possibly being entrained by the plasma outflow from the nucleus . as for the far - ir dust ,",
    "we can not obtain a clear result whether or not the dust is extended along the minor axis due to relatively poor spatial resolutions    ( 160mm,)fig7.eps",
    "with akari , we obtain the near- to far - ir images of ngc  3079 in 10 photometric bands .",
    "we derive seds for the 4 kpc center region , the two 4 kpc disk regions , and the whole galaxy .",
    "the seds consist of far - ir continuum emission from dust with a single temperature of 2833 k and strong mid - ir emission features from pahs .",
    "we derive the dust masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the central 4 kpc region and the whole galaxy , respectively , and find that ngc  3079 has unusually high dust - to - gas mass ratios in the central 4 kpc region ( @xmath2 1100 ) , and even for the whole galaxy ( @xmath2 860 ) .",
    "the ratio of the surface brightness distribution at the wavelength of 7 @xmath3 to that at 11 @xmath3 suggests spatial variations in the properties of pahs ; emission from ionized and neutral pahs is relatively strong in the center and the disk regions , respectively .",
