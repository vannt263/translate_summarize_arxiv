    "viscosity is one of the key properties influencing the overall behavior of magmatic liquids .",
    "it is a fundamental property in earth sciences and has therefore led after nearly five decades of intensive research to a huge body of experimental and theoretical studies and data base ( giordano et al . , 2008 ;",
    "mysen and richet , 2005 ) .",
    "systematic investigations with composition and temperature in simple or complex silicates have been performed , and some generic trends have been identified that have become quite popular .",
    "for instance , it has been found that numerous systems were displaying an arrhenius behavior ( micoulaut , 2010 ) with temperature of the form @xmath1 $ ] where e@xmath2 represents the activation energy for viscous flow .",
    "when properely rescaled with a reference temperature , t@xmath3 , at which the viscosity is 10@xmath4 poise , two categories of liquids have been identified ( angell , 1995 ) : those which remain arrhenius - like in the super - cooled liquid over the entire range of temperatures implying that e@xmath2 does not depend on t , and those which display a curvature in the arrhenius representation ( a semi - log plot as a function of inverse temperature ) indicating that one has a temperature dependence in the activation energy for viscous flow ( wang et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "usually , such liquids are fitted quite successfully with a tamman - vogel - fulcher ( tvf ) law ( pathmanathan and johari , 1990 ; giordano and dingwell , 2003a , b ) : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and t@xmath7 being constants .",
    "there has been a continuing effort to measure viscosity as function of pressure ( scarfe , 1973 ; kushiro , 1976 , 1978 ; 1986 ; kushiro et al .",

    "liebske et al . , 2005 ; ardia et al .",
    ", 2008 ; del gaudio and behrens , 2009 ) . at constant temperature , the evolution of viscosity with pressure is complex and depends on the composition of the silicate melt , in particular on its degree of depolymerization .",
    "with highly polymerized melts ( e.g. albite and dacite ) the viscosity decreases continuously with pressure , though its behavior above the maximal pressure of investigation ( @xmath87  gpa for albite and dacite ) can not be clearly anticipated .",
    "however , it is observed that the decrease of the viscosity with pressure becomes more gradual when the temperature is raised and can lead to a plateau value at high pressure ( e.g. jadeite ) . when the melt is less polymerized ( e.g. albite - diopside system ) , after an initial decrease , and according to the temperature , the viscosity exhibits a plateau value or a weakly pronounced minimum with the pressure . with depolymerized melts ( e.g. diopside and peridotite ) a different situation occurs .",
    "the viscosity first increases with rising pressure and reaches a maximum value prior to decrease at higher pressure , but higher the degree of depolymerization of the melt more pronounced is the viscosity maximum .",
    "moreover , in a more general way , the pressure evolution of the viscosity has been found to be ( anti- ) correlated with that of the oxygen and silicon diffusion coefficients ( shimizu and kushiro , 1991 ; poe et al .",
    ", 1997 ; reid et al . , 2001 ; tinker et al . , 2003 ) , a finding which has been interpreted as the signature of a pressure - induced structural rearrangement",
    ".    the understanding of changes in the viscous flow with applied pressure can be suitably investigated by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "there are several ways to compute viscosity .",
    "readers should refer to allen and tildesley ( 1987 ) for a detailed discussion and presentation . at equilibrium",
    ", the computation of viscosity from md simulations can be performed by using the green - kubo ( gk ) formalism which is based on the calculation of the stress auto - correlation function ( boon and yip , 1980 ) given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 component ( @xmath12)=(x , y , z ) of the molecular stress tensor defined by : @xmath13 where f@xmath14 is the component @xmath15 of the force between the ions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the @xmath20 component of the distance between two atoms @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the velocity of atom @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "alternative forms for @xmath21 exist ( allen and tildesley , 1987 ) but these are found to lead to spurious effects when periodic boundary conditions are considered ( lee , 2007 ) or when the ewald sum is not performed in a neat way ( alejandre et al . , 1995 ; allen et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath22 is found to not decay to zero in the long - time limit , as expected ( lee , 2007 ; green , 1957 ; kubo , 1957 ) .",
    "one other possibility is to compute the viscosity within the framework of non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( lees and edwards , 1972 ) . here ,",
    "the ratio of shear stress to a strain rate is computed and extrapolated to the limit of zero driving force ( borodin et al .",
    ", 2009 ; fernandez et al . 2004 ; cherne and deymier , 1998 ) .    coming back to the gk formalism commonly used with md simulations , the viscosity is calculated from the time integral of the stress auto - correlation function @xmath22 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ equf ] ) and ( [ equ2 ] ) ) , @xmath23    the viscosity of a few silicate melts has been evaluated by md simulation in following this route .",
    "ogawa et al . (",

    "( 2007 ) in investigating by md the properties of silicate liquids along the mgo - sio@xmath0 join found a viscosity minimum at about 20 gpa in pure silica , a viscosity minimum which disappears progressively with increasing mgo content . since then , these results have been confirmed by the md studies of adjaoud et al .",

    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were performed with the dl_poly 2.0 code ( smith and forrester , 1996 ) in npt ensemble . the equations of motions for atoms were solved with a time step of 1 - 2 fs ( 10@xmath25  s ) by the leap - frog algorithm .",
    "liquid na@xmath0o-2sio@xmath0 has been simulated by placing 666 silicon , 666 sodium , and 1668 oxygen atoms in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as the atoms are bearing charges ( ions ) , the long range coulombic forces are evaluated by a ewald sum .",

    "( [ teter ] ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the morb melt and the potential parameters are those given by guillot and sator ( 2007a ) in their simulation study of natural silicate melts ( see tables 1 and 2 therein ) .",
    "the simulated sample of morb was composed of 3,000 atoms ( 555 si , 12 ti , 195 al , 9 fe@xmath34 , 60 fe@xmath35 , 126 mg , 141 ca , 63 na , 3 k , and 1,836 o ) contained in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the control parameters ( time step , ensemble , etc . ) of the simulation are the same as for liquid ns2 .",
    "the density of morb at liquidus temperature and its equation of state ( i.e. density versus pressure ) are well reproduced by the md calculation ( for a detailed description of the properties of the morb melt , see guillot and sator 2007a , b ) .",
    "notice that long simulation runs ( @xmath810  ns or 10@xmath36 time steps ) were performed to reach a good statistics when evaluating the viscosity by the green - kubo integrand .    before presenting results , it is worthwhile to keep in mind some key data when one is about to calculate the viscosity of a supercooled melt . in using a high performance computer ,",
    "the longest md run that can be performed ( in a reasonable time ) for a system composed of @xmath8 3,000 atoms is about 1 @xmath37  s ( or 10@xmath38 md steps ) . to observe on this timescale the diffusion of atoms in the simulation box , the mean square displacement of each atom after 1 @xmath37  s has to be ( on average ) of the order of @xmath810  @xmath39",
    "( the mean distance between two nearest neighbors is roughly 3    in a melt , so the diffusive regime is reached when each atom has interchanged its position with a nearest neighbor ) .",
    "therefore , the smallest diffusion coefficient that can be evaluated over a 1 @xmath37  s md run is equal to @xmath8 2@xmath4010@xmath41  m@xmath39/s ( from einstein relation @xmath42=@xmath43 where @xmath44=10  @xmath39 and t@xmath45 = 10@xmath46  s ) . in applying the eyring theory to viscous flow , the viscosity @xmath47 can be deduced from the diffusion coefficient @xmath48 of network forming ions through the equation , @xmath49 where t is the temperature and @xmath50 a jump distance in the viscous flow .",
    "experimentally it has been shown ( shimizu and kushiro , 1984 ) that this equation works well with viscous liquids ( e.g. silicates with high silica contents ) provided that the d value is assigned to that of o or si atoms and @xmath512.8 , the oxygen - oxygen mean distance in silicate melts . using equ .",
    "( [ eyring ] ) , a value of d@xmath52 equal to 2@xmath4010@xmath41  m@xmath39/s leads to a corresponding viscosity af about 3000  pa.s at 1473  k. we can use the maxwell relation for which the relaxation time for viscous flow is related to the viscosity through the equation , @xmath53 , where @xmath54  pa.s is the shear modulus at infinite frequency ( dingwell and webb , 1989 ) .",
    "so to fully relax a viscous melt of viscosity @xmath55  pa.s one needs to perform a md run longer than @xmath56 , a finding consistent with the evaluation based on the diffusion .",
    "although qualitative , these estimates are useful because they point out that only the low viscosity regime ( i.e. @xmath47 @xmath57 10@xmath58 pa.s ) can be investigated by md simulation , the highly viscous regime ( 10@xmath58 - 10@xmath4  pa.s ) being unreachable with usual numerical resources . in the present study our md runs did not exceed @xmath810 ns , which means that only a viscosity value smaller than @xmath810  pa.s ( 100 poise ) could be investigated ( notice that most of the md studies published in the literature often do not exceed 1 ns run intervals ) .",

    "we remark that the diffusion coefficients display an arrhenius - like dependence when 10@xmath58/t@xmath664 with activation energies equal to 1.18  ev , 1.17  ev and 0.43  ev for si , o and na respectively .    to be complete",
    ", one should stress that alternative potentials ( kramer et al . , 1991 ) lead to diffusion coefficients for ( na , si , o ) that are found ( horbach et al . , 2001 ) to be at least one order of magnitude lower than the experimental values ( for 10@xmath58/t@xmath665 ) , and our own results on the morb liquid as well ( see below ) , whereas the corresponding activation energies also differ by a factor of @xmath82 ( fig .",

    "these findings illustrate how difficult the numerical reproduction of diffusion coefficients in silicate melts can be .",
    "this well - known feature has been highlighted for the case of silica by hemmati and angell ( 1997 ) who showed that diffusion is highly model dependent with differences between models increasing up to at least three orders of magnitude when the liquid is cooled down .",

    "si and o atoms diffuse too rapidly in the simulated morb ( by a factor of @xmath85 for na and @xmath850 for si and o ) .",

    "as mentioned above , the stress auto - correlation function is indeed found to decay to zero .",
    "typical oscillations which are found at the subpicosecond timescale are associated with frequencies in the terahertz range and above [ 10 - 300 thz ] corresponding to the main band found in the vibrational density of states .",

    "the viscosity of ns2 exhibits an arrhenius - like behavior over a broad temperature range ( 2@xmath6910@xmath58/t@xmath696 ) .",
    "the calculated activation energy for viscous flow is about @xmath81.33  ev which is in a reasonable agreement with bockris data ( @xmath81.65 ev ) measured ( bockris et al . , 1954 ) in the temperature range ( 1723 - 1373 k or 5.8@xmath6910@xmath58/t@xmath697.3 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the temperature range where calculated and experimental values can be compared with each other ( i.e. 5.8@xmath6910@xmath58/t@xmath696.7 ) calculated values are smaller by a factor of @xmath82 than the experimental data of bockris et al .",
    "this deviation is surpring given the good agreement obtained for the diffusion coefficients ( see figure [ diff_compar ] ) , and given the fact that @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be simply related ( equ .",
    "[ eyring ] ) .    in the case of morb",
    "the temperature dependence of the calculated viscosity is found to be non arrhenian and can be fitted accurately over a large temperature range by the tvf equation with @xmath70=6.5@xmath40  10@xmath71 poise , @xmath6 = 0.42  ev , and @xmath72 = 670  k. experimentally , the viscosity of basaltic melts is known to be non arrhenian , so the simulation reproduces this feature , but the simulated morb is much less viscous than the real one ( a factor of 50 at 1673 k , see fig . [ visco_t ] ) , this is why @xmath6 and @xmath72 values are slightly different from those recommended for basalts by the regression formula of giordano and dingwell ( 2003a , b ) , and giordano et al .",
    "in fact the morb melt simulated at 1273 k corresponds , as far as the viscosity is concerned , to the real melt at about 1673k , this temperature deviation diminishing at higher temperatures where the viscosity of any silicate melt ( whatever is its composition ) tends to be very low ( less than 0.1 poise above 3000 k ) . more generally , the agreement between experimental and calculated viscosities for silicate melts is actually difficult to obtain because the viscosity seems to be even more sensitive to the details of the potential than the diffusion coefficients themselves ( for a related discussion see vuilleumier et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , direct comparisons between experimental and simulated values of the viscosity are scarce in the literature ( e.g. lacks et al . , 2007 ; adjaoud et al . , 2008 ; karki and stixrude , 2010b , spera et al",
    ". , 2011 ) and are usually done at very high temperature ( @xmath662500k ) where the viscosity is very low and its experimental value badly known or obtained from uncontrolled high - temperature extrapolations .    in the tvf equation",
    ", @xmath70 represents the high temperature limit to silicate melt viscosity . by analyzing measured viscosity curves for a great number of silicate liquids",
    ", it has been shown that all silicate melts converge to a common value of viscosity at very high - t , about 10@xmath73 - 10@xmath71 poise ( russell et al . , 2003 ; giordano et al . , 2008 , zheng et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "but it is difficult to test this conjecture because of a lack of viscosity data for silicate liquids at super - liquidus temperatures ( i.e. for t @xmath74 2000 k ) .",
    "in contrast , the simulation can shed some light on this topic because the high - t range is easily accessible in a numerical experiment .",
    "however it is worthwhile to clarify what means the concept of a high - temperature limit for a silicate liquid . when a silicate melt is heated isobarically ( e.g. under atmospheric pressure ) it vaporizes incongruently in forming a gaseous phase which is a complex mixture of atoms and molecules ( e.g. the major vapor species above liquid silica are sio , sio@xmath0 , o@xmath0 and o , and about thirty species compose the vapor phase above a basaltic lava , for a review see schaefer and fegley , 2004 ) .",
    "nevertheless this is not a real problem as long as the resulting vapor pressure remains low , i.e. the temperature is not too high ( e.g. the vapor pressure above basaltic lavas is 10@xmath75 - 10@xmath76 bar at 1900 k ) .",
    "this situation changes drastically at higher temperature where the vapor pressure becomes high ( e.g. @xmath810@xmath73 bar at 2500k above for a tholeiitic liquid ) .",
    "then the vaporized fraction becomes rapidly non - negligible ( 10% or more ) and the composition of the residual melt deviates significantly from the original one . to avoid this problem ,",
    "one only has to prevent vapor formation in applying on the liquid an isostatic pressure larger than the saturating vapor pressure .",
    "a convenient thermodynamic path consists to follow ( or to be as close as possible ) the liquid branch of the liquid - vapor coexistence curve up to the critical point .",
    "the critical point parameters for silicates have never been measured because of the very high temperatures involved ( much beyond 5000 k , estimations for sio@xmath0 are given in guissani and guillot ( 1994 ) and melosh ( 2007 ) ) . by imposing the pressure ,",
    "we have been able to evaluate the viscosity of our simulated morb along ( or close by ) the liquid branch of the liquid - vapor coexistence curve .",
    "however due to the density fluctuations generated by the md calculation it becomes more and more difficult to preserve the cohesion of the liquid phase in rising the temperature because the liquid then tends to transform spontaneously into the corresponding vapor phase .",
    "so the highest temperature reached in keeping the cohesion of the liquid phase around 1 bar was 4673k , a temperature at which the density is equal to 1.47  g/@xmath32 and the viscosity is evaluated to 10@xmath77 poise .",
    "this latter value matches rather well the estimated range for @xmath70 ( 10@xmath73 - 10@xmath71 poise , see above ) .",
    "it is certainly possible to pursue the calculation at higher temperature up to the critical point , but it is a tedious task to locate accurately the critical point of our model and we leave that to a future work . in using the same procedure with liquid",
    "ns2 we have reached 4500k , a temperature at which the liquid density is as low as 1.66 g/@xmath32 and its viscosity 10@xmath78 poise .",
    "we anticipate that the common value of @xmath70 for morb and ns2 at the critical point could be about 10@xmath71 poise or slightly less .",
    "notice that in approaching the critical point , the structure of a silicate liquid is quite different of the structure from the melt near the liquidus .",
    "the near critical liquid is indeed fully depolymerized and is composed of molecular clusters involving various species ( oxides ) .",
    "so it is expected that all silicate liquids will exhibit similar flow behavior in the critical region , that of a regular molecular liquid .",

    "[ diffmorb ] ) .",
    "the behavior of network forming ions ( si , o ) is quite different as their diffusion coefficients go through a maximum value with the pressure .",
    "furthermore this maximum is located at about 15  gpa in ns2 and about 50  gpa in morb and it is much more pronounced in the ns2 melt than in the basaltic composition .",
    "notice that a diffusivity maximum for network forming ions is also observed with silica ( shell et al .",
    "2002 ) , germania ( dreyfus and micoulaut , 2012 ) , some sodo - aluminosilicates ( poe et al . , 1997 ) and in water ( errington and debenedetti , 2001 ) .",

    ", the viscosity shows no minimum , it is nearly constant up to 5  gpa and increases progressively at a higher pressure .",

    "as briefly recalled in the introduction , the pressure dependence of the viscosity has been reported experimentally for a number of silicates ( scarfe , 1973 ; kushiro , 1976 , 1978 ; 1986 ; kushiro et al . , 1976 ; brearley et al . , 1986",

    "the analysis of these data along the sequence of composition albite@xmath79 jadeite@xmath79 rhyolite@xmath79 andesite@xmath79 basalts@xmath79 albite@xmath80-diopside@xmath81 @xmath79 jadeite@xmath80-diopside@xmath81 @xmath79 diopside @xmath79 peridotite , which covers a large nbo / t range ( from 0 to 2.8 ) , leads to a contrasted picture . in the initial pressure range ( 0 - 2  gpa ) , the slope ( d@xmath47/dp)@xmath82 is negative for composition with nbo / t @xmath83 1.2 and is positive for higher nbo / t value .",
    "although the nbo / t ratio is a good indicator of melt polymerization , its use for predicting the pressure evolution of viscosity requires some caution ( e.g. toplis and dingwell , 2004 ) .",
    "for instance , albite and jadeite melts are both considered as fully polymerized ( nbo / t=0 ) but the pressure behavior of their viscosity is different ( a viscosity curve presenting a weak minimum located about 2 - 3  gpa for jadeite as compared with a continuous decrease of the viscosity over several decades up to 7  gpa for albite , see suzuki et al . 2002 , 2011 ) . in keeping in mind this information , and according to the above data analysis",
    ", the viscosity of ns2 and morb composition ( nbo / t=1 and 0.8 ) should exhibit a negative slope .",
    "for instance , scarfe et al . (",
    "1987 ) notice that the viscosity of the ns2 melt is decreasing between 0 and 2  gpa .",
    "in the same way , the viscosity of oceanic basalts ( kushiro et al . , 1976 ; kushiro , 1986 ; ando , 2003 ) maintained at fixed temperature decreases slightly with increasing pressure up to 3  gpa where it reaches a minimum value prior increase upon further compression .",
    "but as an increase of the temperature tends to decrease the viscosity of a melt maintained at a fixed pressure , the weak minimum of viscosity in basalts is expected to disappear in increasing the temperature .",
    "this is why a viscosity minimum is barely visible with our morb melt simulated at 2273k , especially as the latter one describes the viscous flow of a real morb at a higher temperature , may be as high as 2600 - 2700 k ( see fig . [ visco_t ] ) .",
    "in contrast the viscosity of the simulated ns2 melt at 2000 k presents a clear minimum as a function of pressure ( notice that the temperature dependence of the viscosity of the ns2 melt is much better reproduced by the simulation than in the morb case , see fig .",
    "[ visco_t ] ) .    since the first report of an anomalous pressure dependence of the viscosity ( ( d@xmath47/dp)@xmath82 @xmath690 ) by kushiro ( 1976 ) and kushiro et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , different authors have tried to explain the origin of this phenomenon . using the adam - gibbs theory and a pressure dependence for the degree of melt polymerization , bottinga and richet ( 1995 )",
    "have shown that the decrease of the specific volume with alkali content was leading to an increased sensitivity of the viscosity with pressure change .",
    "gupta ( 1987 ) has proposed that a system having a thermal expansion coefficient in a glass larger than that of a liquid could display such anomalies . however",
    ", this does not seem to be verified experimentally ( knoche et al .",
    "a relationship with structural changes under pressure also has been proposed , in particular a pressure - induced coordination change of si and al or si - o and al - o bond weakening due to pressure - induced distortion of the liquid structure ( waff , 1975 ; mysen et al .",
    "however , a study ( sharma et al . , 1979 ) on dense liquid geo@xmath0 where both coordination change ( micoulaut et al .",
    "2006 ) and a pressure induced viscosity anomaly occur could not establish the correlation .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of a structural origin for the anomaly .",
    "for instance , suzuki et al . (",
    "2002 ) do find a correlation between the gradual decrease of the viscosity of albite with pressure up to 7  gpa and the increasing concentration of 5-coordinated al .",
    "the variation of @xmath47 along an isotherm also suggests that the corresponding activation energy for viscous flow e@xmath84(p , t ) is minimum . here",
    ", for selected pressures in the ns2 system , we have computed @xmath47 with temperature and find that the activation for viscous flow should minimize indeed in the pressure window , i.e. we obtain e@xmath85=1.33 , 1.09 and 1.34  ev for p=0 , 6 , and 22 gpa , respectively .",
    "the link between e@xmath85 minima and the presence of a stress - free state in corresponding low - temparature glassy networks has been established recently ( micoulaut , 2010 ) , indicative of a flexible to rigid transition ( micoulaut and phillips , 2003 ) . since it is known that at ambient pressure the ns2 is flexible ( vaills et al . , 2005 ) , one may obtain a pressure - induced flexible to rigid transition with increasing p ( trachenko et al .",
    "2004 ) , the minimum in e@xmath85 ( and @xmath47 ) being one of the expected salient features .    in summary , all these studies point out the subtle interplay between structure , dynamics and thermodynamics of the silicate melt that leads to anomalous behavior in transport properties .",
    "the connection between diffusion and viscosity can be realized in a simple way _ via _ the eyring relationship given by eq .",
    "( [ eyring ] ) involving @xmath50 which is a typical jump distance for the diffusing atom .",
    "according to eyring , the relationship ( [ eyring ] ) holds ( i.e. @xmath50 is constant and equal to the average interatomic distance ) if the activated process for diffusion can be assumed identical with that of viscous flow .",
    "so for silicate melts the network forming ions ( si and o ) are good candidates to fulfill this prerequisite .",
    "in fact the eyring relationship has been tested over a large range of melt composition , from simple binary oxides to natural magma compositions ( oishi et al .",
    ", 1975 ; yinnon and cooper , 1980 ; dunn , 1982 ; shimizu and kushiro , 1984 ; dunn and scarfe , 1986 ; lesher et al . , 1996 ; reid et al . , 2003 ;",
    "tinker et al . , 2004 ) . in polymerized melts of high viscosity ( e.g. jadeite ) , it is observed that the diffusivity of oxygen ions and the melt viscosity are related to each other through the eyring relation in introducing for the jump distance , @xmath50 , the average oxygen - oxygen distance in the melt ( @xmath8  2.8 ) . in depolymerized melts where the viscosity is generally lower ( e.g. basalts and diopside ) ,",
    "the eyring relation is fulfilled with @xmath50 larger than 2 - 3 times the mean oxygen - oxygen distance .",
    "however even in polymerized melts , the eyring relation fails to fully reproduce the correlated evolution of viscosity and oxygen self - diffusion coefficient . as a matter of fact",
    "it has been reported that oxygen self - diffusion coefficient in albite ( poe et al . , 1997 ) and in dacite melts (",
    "tinker and lesher , 2001 ) reaches a maximum value at about 5  gpa whereas the viscosity of the corresponding liquids is continuously decreasing with the pressure and shows no viscosity minimum at 5  gpa ( suzuki et al . , 2002 ; tinker et al . , 2004 ) . in this context",
    ", we have evaluated the length , @xmath86 along two thermodynamic paths : the isobar p=0 ( with varying temperature ) and the isotherm t=2000k for ns2 ( with varying pressure ) . for convenience",
    "this length is represented in fig .",
    "[ eyring_loglog ] as function of the calculated melt viscosity . along each path ( isobar or isotherm )",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of the increasing thermodynamic parameter ( t or p ) .",
    "notice that in the representation @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ eyring_loglog ] ) , both curves exhibit a maximum value ( 22 ) for both the isotherm and the isobar which expresses a non - trivial behavior of @xmath47 with diffusivity . clearly , for the two melt compositions and whatever the thermodynamic path , @xmath50 decreases when the melt viscosity increases .",
    "a simple extrapolation suggests that the eyring relation should be verified only when the viscosity is sufficiently high ( for @xmath88 100 poise),i.e .",
    "when @xmath50 becomes of the order of @xmath8 5 .. this conclusion is in agreement with the viscosity data discussed above .",
    "on the other hand , when the viscosity is becoming very low and the diffusion coefficients of network forming ions high ( @xmath66 10@xmath89  m@xmath39/s ) , the length @xmath50 matches better the values predicted by the stokes - einstein equation , @xmath50 = 2@xmath90d , where d is the diameter of the diffusing molecule ( @xmath8   3  for oxygen ) . as the stokes - einstein relation works well with molecular liquids ( li and chang , 1955 )",
    "it is not too surprising that it also leads to reasonable values for silicate liquids at very high temperature ( e.g. in approaching the critical point ) where the melt is essentially depolymerized and shares some structural similarities with regular liquids . in summary ,",
    "the eyring relation is not adapted to the description of the transport properties of silicate melts at superliquidus temperatures .",
    "alternative models have been proposed in the literature ( see mungall , 2002 ) but a quantitative theory is still lacking .",

    ", 2002 ) . from the liquid structures obtained for the two melt compositions ( ns2 and morb ) , we have computed the fraction of silicon atoms that are 4- ,",
    "5- and 6-fold coordinated .",
    "results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ entropy]a . here",
    "one sees that the melt structure evolves from roughly 100% 4-coordinated si@xmath91 to a growing proportion of si@xmath92 and si@xmath93 , si@xmath92 increasing substantially for @xmath94 larger than 10  gpa and going through a maximum found at about 25 gpa in ns2 ( and above this pressure for morb ) whereas si@xmath93 is becoming significant only above 15gpa .    from the probability distribution \\{p@xmath95 } of si@xmath96 species ( i = iv , v , vi )",
    ", one can compute a configurational entropy according to : @xmath97    which maximizes when the population of s@xmath92 is maximum ( @xmath830  gpa ) .",
    "this configurational entropy is represented in fig .",
    "[ entropy]b as @xmath98[1/s@xmath99 .",
    "in fact , if one assumes that the adam - gibbs relation for viscosity of the form : @xmath100 $ ] is valid , one may expect from a simple inspection of the relationship that a minimum in @xmath47 is correlated with a maximum in @xmath101 , as also suggested by bottinga and richet ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , for ns2 a quick look at figure [ entropy]b clearly shows that @xmath47(p ) and @xmath98[1/s@xmath99 are not correlated as the location of the maximum in s@xmath102 does not coincide with the pressure range where a viscosity minimum is observed . in the case of morb ,",
    "the gradual increase of the viscosity with pressure could be correlated with that of @xmath101 .",
    "so it is hard to firmly conclude that a structural reorganization through coordination changes of si is directly responsible of the pressure evolution of the viscosity . to be complete , notice that goel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have recently shown by md simulations that the diffusion coefficient of si atoms in silicate melts along the mgo - sio@xmath0 join , correlates well with the excess entropy when the latter one is evaluated from the knowledge of the pair distribution functions .",
    "but it is unclear if this correlation also holds with the viscosity as the relationship linking diffusivity and viscosity is far to be obvious ( see the above discussion ) .",
    "we have therefore calculated an excess entropy s@xmath0 in using the expression of the two - body term ( baranyai and evans , 1989 ) , which writes : @xmath103d{\\bf r }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68 being the density , and @xmath104 the concentration of species @xmath16 .",
    "results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy]b ( right axis ) .",
    "s@xmath0 is found to decrease continuously with pressure and a corresponding adam - gibbs @xmath47 does not show a viscosity minimum .",
    "this behavior is at variance with that obtained by goel et al . (",
    "2011 ) in their md simulation study of mgo-2sio@xmath0 ( a system related to ns2 ) where s@xmath0 is exhibiting an entropy maximum around 10  gpa , very well correlated with a diffusivity maximum , as also found by jabes et al . (",
    "2010 ) for liquid sio@xmath0 , geo@xmath0 , befe@xmath0 and h@xmath0o .",

    "c ) mean angle around the bridging oxygen ( bo ) atom and corresponding second moment ( standard deviation ) of the bond angle distribution ( right axis ) . ]    an alternative way to understand the trends of the viscosity with pressure may arise from the evolution of the t - o - t intertetrahedral bond angle distribution ( bad ) as it is well known that bond angles are much more pressure sensitive than bonds themselves ( micoulaut , 2004 ) .",
    "figure [ entropy]c shows the evolution of the average value of the bad between a bridging oxygen ( bo ) and its two sio@xmath105 tetrahedra , together with the second moment ( standard deviation ) of the bad .",
    "the latter one quantifies the angular excursion around a mean value and it is expected to be pressure sensitive , as highlighted in the case of densified gese@xmath0 ( bauchy et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "when the average value of the bad decreases steadily in ns2 melt from 150@xmath106 to 140@xmath106 between p=0 and 20 gpa , it varies between 140@xmath106 and 128@xmath106 in morb over the same pressure range . in the same way the angular excursion increases ( with pressure ) equally well in the ns2 and in morb melt as shown by the standard deviation @xmath107 evolution with pressure .",
    "so , here again , it is not clear that viscosity and diffusion anomalies ( e.g. in ns2 ) induced by the pressure can be univoquely associated with a particular structural rearrangement even if there is no doubt that structural changes are taking place in the silicate melt under investigation .",
    "in summary , we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of two systems of importance in materials science and geology : the sodium disilicate ( ns2 ) and a basaltic ( morb ) liquid .",
    "results show that the diffusion constant computed from a two - body born - majer type potential at ambient conditions exhibits a remarkable agreement with experimental data for all species ( na , si , o ) in the ns2 liquid .",
    "this contrasts with the level of agreement obtained for the morb system which shows a deviation by at least one order of magnitude when compared to experimental findings .",
    "the same situation is nearly reproduced in the comparison of calculated viscosity using the green - kubo formalism ( based on the stress auto - correlation function ) with experimental data from bockris et al ; ( 1955 ) for ns2 , and villeneuve et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for morb .",
    "we have then studied the behavior of both the diffusion constant and the viscosity with changing pressure in the two liquids with temperature close to 2000  k. in the ns2 system , a diffusivity maximum for the network forming species ( si , o ) is obtained at around 15  gpa , a result which parallels similar findings for other densified tetrahedral liquids such as water , germania , or silica .",
    "the sodium cation is found to display three distinctive rgimes for diffusion , the one corresponding to lower densities ( negative pressure ) being identified with a stretched melt ( bauchy and micoulaut , 2011 ) .",
    "these features are not found in the more depolymerized morb liquid which shows for si and o diffusion a steady behavior between 0 and 5  gpa , followed by a continuous decrease applied pressure .",
    "interestingly , a pressure window is found in the ns2 liquid with a minimum at around 5  gpa that does not seem to be correlated with the maximum in the obtained diffusivity .",
    "again , this contrasts with the steadily increase of the morb liquid viscosity with pressure .    having in hand both the computed diffusion and the viscosity , we have investigated the validity of the eyring equation which relates both quantities and involves also a jump distance @xmath50 usually of the order of the average oxygen - oxygen bond distance ( 2.8   ) , as exemplified by numerous experimental studies .",
    "this investigation has been performed along two thermodynamic paths : at fixed pressure ( p=0 ) and changing temperature , and at fixed temperature ( t@xmath8 2000 k ) and changing pressure .",
    "we have shown that @xmath50 calculated from the simulated diffusion and viscosity was indeed of the order of a few angstroems , but only in the high viscosity rgime ( here 100 poise ) .",
    "it underscores the fact that the eyring relationship should hold only for deeply supercooled liquids as it fails for liquidus temperatures .",
    "finally , we have attempted to relate the obtained anomalies in viscosity with structural changes of the melt . with growing pressure ,",
    "the population of higher coordinated silicon ( si@xmath92 , si@xmath93 ) increases in a similar fashion in the ns2 and morb liquid which rules out the possibility of a direct relationship between e.g. coordination increase and viscosity minimum .",
    "moreover , in the ns2 liquid configurational entropies have been calculated and their behavior with pressure does not follow at all the trend obtained for the viscosity .",
    "more subtle structural and thermodynamic changes are clearly at play and one does not recover for ns2 the reported correlation between configurational entropy and diffusivity maxima found by goel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in the mgo - sio@xmath0 system .    our attempts to find out a quantitative link between pressure - induced structural rearrangement and viscosity anomalies is rather deceptive .",
    "although some correlations between diffusivity , viscosity and excess entropy certainly do exist and are sometimes emphasized in the literature , their effectiveness depends strongly on the melt composition , a fact which makes risky a clear conclusion . on the other hand , a recent theoretical analysis by schmelzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) seems to be promising . in this",
    "study the pressure dependence of the viscosity is analyzed from a thermodynamical point of view .",
    "the working equation expresses the derivative of the viscosity with respect to the pressure under the following form , @xmath108    where @xmath109 is an order parameter ( e.g. the degree of polymerization given by bo/(bo+nbo ) where bo and nbo are the numbers of bridging and nonbridging oxygen , respectively ) , @xmath110 is the compressibility and @xmath111 the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "if the order parameter is invariant with pressure ( so d@xmath109/dp=0 ) then d@xmath47/dp is governed by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) which expresses a free volume effect ( @xmath47 only varies with the total volume of the melt ) . but as @xmath110 is negative in a liquid at equilibrium , and @xmath112 is positive ( the viscosity decreases when the temperature increases ) , the variation of @xmath47 with p will be positive or negative according to the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath111 . if the latter one is negative then the viscosity will tend to decrease in increasing pressure and if @xmath111 becomes positive after a further compression then the viscosity will go to a minimum value before to increase . as shown by schmelzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) this behavior is encountered with the viscosity of liquid water .",
    "however the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) is not sufficient to reproduce all the magnitude of the viscosity minimum and the contribution of structural changes induced by the pressure has to be accounted for ( via the second term in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) ) . in the case of silicate melts it is well documented that the viscosity increases when the degree of polymerization of the melt increases ( so d@xmath47/d@xmath1130 ) wheras for a given melt its degree of polymerization decreases when pressure increases ( so d@xmath109/dp@xmath690 )",
    ". therefore the second term of eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) is generally negative . for ns2 and morb",
    "we have checked that @xmath111 is positive at liquid temperature and over a large pressure range which implies that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) is positive for these two compositions . as our md results for ns2",
    "lead to a decrease of the viscosity between 0 and @xmath84gpa , this suggests that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) overbalances the first term . for morb",
    "the viscosity is found virtually constant in the 0 - 4  gpa range so the two terms nearly compensate each other in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) . at high pressures",
    "( e.g. above 10 or 20  gpa ) the two melts are more and more depolymerized and d@xmath109/dp becomes small because the degree of depolymerization does not evolve very much with the pressure due to melt densification .",
    "so the free volume effect ( first term ) is the dominant contribution to eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) at high compression rates and the viscosity of the two melts increases steadily in the high pressure range .",
    "in summary it appears that eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) is very useful to decipher the complex behavior exhibited by the viscosity of silicate melts as function of pressure . to be more quantitative and predictive",

    "<S> we present results for transport properties ( diffusion and viscosity ) using computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> focus is made on a densified binary sodium disilicate 2sio@xmath0-na@xmath0o ( ns2 ) liquid and on multicomponent magmatic liquids ( morb , basalt ) . in the ns2 liquid , results show that a certain number of anomalies appear when the system is densified : the usual diffusivity maxima / minima is found for the network - forming ions ( si , o ) whereas the sodium atom displays three distinct rgimes for diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> some of these features can be correlated with the obtained viscosity anomaly under pressure , the latter being be fairly well reproduced from the simulated diffusion constant . in model magmas ( morb liquid ) , we find a plateau followed by a continuous increase of the viscosity with pressure . </S>",
    "<S> finally , having computed both diffusion and viscosity independently , we can discuss the validity of the eyring equation for viscosity which relates diffusion and viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that it can be considered as valid in melts with a high viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> on the overall , these results highlight the difficulty of establishing a firm relationship between dynamics , structure and thermodynamics in complex liquids . </S>"
