    "the overall strategy for the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] is similar to that of rdl , ruciski and szemerdi in  @xcite , which in turn is typical for proving sharp results . indeed , we split the argument into ` extremal ' and ` non - extremal ' cases , and use the absorbing method developed by rdl , ruciski and szemerdi  @xcite in the non - extremal case .",
    "however , our non - extremal case is somewhat different from @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath74 case and study the structure of an auxiliary graph @xmath75 , whose vertices are all @xmath76-subsets of @xmath5 , and two @xmath76-sets @xmath77 are joined by an edge if and only if @xmath78 . furthermore , we use the hypergraph removal lemma ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and a structural result of keevash and sudakov  @xcite .",
