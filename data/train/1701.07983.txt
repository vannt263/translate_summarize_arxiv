    "we consider a two - time - scale systems of jump - diffusion stochastic differential equation in form of @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the drift functions @xmath3 the diffusion functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the vector of @xmath8-dimensional independent brownian motions on a complete stochastic base @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is a scalar simple poisson process with intensity @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a scalar simple poisson process with intensity @xmath13 .",
    "the positive parameter @xmath14 is small and describes the ratio of time scales between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "systems - with two time scale occur frequently in applications including chemical kinetics , signal processing , complex fluids and financial engineering .",
    "with the two separation of time scale , we can view the state variable of the system as being divided into two parts : the  slow \" variable @xmath15 and the  fast \" variable @xmath16 .",
    "it is often the case that we are interested only in the dynamics of slow component .",
    "then a simplified equation , which is independent of fast variable and possesses the essential features of the system , is highly desirable .",
    "such a simplified equation is often constructed by averaging procedure as in @xcite for deterministic ordinary differential equations , as well as the further development @xcite for stochastic differential equations with continuous gaussian processes . as far as averaging for stochastic dynamical systems in infinite dimensional space",
    "is concerned , it is worthwhile to quote the important work of @xcite and also the work of @xcite .    in order to derive the averaging dynamics of the system -",
    ", we introduce the fast motion equation with a frozen slow component @xmath17 in form of @xmath18 whose solution is denoted by @xmath19 . under suitable conditions on @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", @xmath19 induces a unique invariant measure @xmath22 on @xmath23 , which is ergodic and ensures the averaged equation : @xmath24 where the averaging nonlinear is defined by setting @xmath25    in @xcite , it is shown that under the above conditions the slow motion @xmath15 converges strongly to the solution @xmath26 of the above averaged equation with jumps .",
    "the order of convergence @xmath27 in strong sense was provided in @xcite . to the best knowledge of the authors",
    ", the existing literature does not address the weak order in averaging principle for jump diffusion stochastic differential systems .",
    "in fact , it is fair to say that the weak convergence in stochastic averaging theory of systems driven by jump noise is not yet fully developed , even though recent years have witnessed some strong approximation results @xcite .    in the present paper , we are interested in the rate of weak convergence of the averaging dynamics to the true solution of slow motion @xmath15 .",
    "namely , we will determine the order , with respect to timescale parameter @xmath14 , of weak deviation between original solution of slow equation and the solution of the corresponding averaged equation .",
    "the main technique we adapted is to finding an expansion with respect to @xmath14 of the solutions of the kolmogorov equations associated with the jump diffusion system .",
    "the solvability of the poisson equation associated with the generator of frozen equation provides an expression for the coefficients of the expansion . as a result",
    ", the boundedness for the coefficients of expansion can be proved by smoothing effect of the corresponding transition semigroups in the space of bounded and uniformly continuous functions , where some regular conditions is needed on drift and diffusion term . our result show that the weak convergence rate to be @xmath0 even when there are jump components in the system , which is the main novelty of this work .",
    "we would like to stress that asymptotic method was first applied by brhier @xcite to an averaging result for stochastic reaction - diffusion equations in the case of gaussian noise of additive type was included only in the fast motion .",
    "however , the extension of this argument is not straightforward .",
    "the method used in the proof of weak order in @xcite is strictly related to the differentiability in time of averaging process .",
    "therefore , once the noise is introduced in the slow equation , difficulties will arise and the procedure becomes more complicated .",
    "our result in this paper bridges such a gap , in which the slow and the fast motions are both perturbed by noise with jumps .    the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to notation , assumptions and summarize preliminary results .",
    "the ergodicity of fast process and the averaging dynamics of system with jumps is introduced in section 3",
    ". then the main result of this article , which is derived via the asymptotic expansions and uniform error estimates , is presented in section 4 . in the final section ,",
    "we state and prove technical lemmas to which we appeal in the preceding section .    throughout",
