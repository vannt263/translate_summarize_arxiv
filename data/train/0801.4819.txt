    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , discovered in 1982@xcite , is a quintessentially strongly correlated quantum phenomenon where electrons in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system condense into a strongly interacting incompressible quantum fluid ground state@xcite with fractionally charged quasiparticle excitations which obey anyonic@xcite , rather than ordinary fermionic or bosonic , quantum statistics .",
    "the fqhe occurs at low temperatures in clean ( high mobility ) 2d semiconductor structures under the influence of a strong external magnetic field applied normal to the 2d plane of confinement of the electron layer .",
    "the subject has been studied extensively during the last 25 years , and reviews@xcite can be found in the literature .    in this article",
    "we provide a detailed numerical theoretical study of _ the orbital landau level _ ( ll ) dependence of the fqhe , emphasizing the relative importance of the _ quasi_-2d layer width , i.e. , the  finite - thickness effect \" , of the electron system transverse to the plane of confinement in the lowest three lls . in the non - interacting 2d system , taken here to be confined in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane with the magnetic field @xmath2 along the @xmath3-direction which is also the direction of confinement with a typical layer width of @xmath4 ( finite @xmath4 corresponds to the realistic quasi-2d system studied in",
    "the laboratory and @xmath5 corresponds to the strictly 2d idealized system often studied theoretically for convenience ) , the application of the external magnetic field leads to the landau quantization of electronic energy levels given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the orbital ll index and @xmath8 is the cyclotron frequency defining the equidistant energy level separation ( i.e. , the simple harmonic oscillator spectrum ) between the 2d lls .",
    "each ll has a macroscopic degeneracy given by @xmath9 per unit area where @xmath10 is the magnetic length ( which is used as the unit of length throughout ) .",
    "for a given 2d electron density of @xmath11 ( per unit area ) , one has a ll filling factor @xmath12 indicating the filling of the macroscopically degenerate lls in the 2d electron system .",
    "if @xmath13 , only the lowest ( orbital ) landau level ( lll ) , by convention denoted as @xmath14 , is fractionally occupied by electrons .",
    "our discussion , so far , has neglected electron spin which is equivalent to assuming the 2d system to be spin polarized ( by a sufficiently strong @xmath2 field , for example ) . including spin degeneracy in the picture introduces",
    "a factor of two since each orbital ll state ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) can be filled with both up and down spins . incorporating spin in this `` trivial '' manner ( i.e. , assuming each orbital ll to be occupied sequentially by spin up and down electrons )",
    ", we get that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and so on , correspond , respectively , to spin up - down orbital lls @xmath14 ( lll ) , @xmath19 ( the second landau level , sll ) , @xmath20 ( the third landau level , tll ) .",
    "our goal in this work is to theoretically investigate the fqhe in @xmath210 , 1 , and 2 and provide a critical _ comparative _ study of the fqhe in the lll , sll , and tll , emphasizing the key role played by the quasi-2d layer thickness parameter @xmath4 ( or more precisely the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 ) in determining the relative strength , stability , or importance of various fqh states in different orbital lls .",
    "we consider only completely spin - polarized ( i.e. , spinless ) fqh states in our calculations since the primary fractional states 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/5 are universally thought to be spin - polarized .",
    "the motivation of our work stems from the experimental observation that fqh states are ubiquitous in the lll ( about 70 distinct fqh states have been experimentally observed@xcite in the @xmath14 lll with @xmath16 ) , fairly rare in the sll ( less than 10 fqh states have been observed@xcite in the @xmath19 sll with @xmath17 , and these are much `` weaker '' than the corresponding lll fqh states in the sense that the observation of the sll fqhe requires much lower temperatures and much higher sample mobilities than in the corresponding ll situation ) , and essentially non - existent in the tll ( no robust @xmath20 , with @xmath18 , tll fqh state has so far been convincingly observed experimentally@xcite ) .",
    "we establish definitively , in this work , that even a _ qualitative _ understanding of the higher ll fqhe ( i.e. , for @xmath23 ) must necessarily include the finite width effect ( in the @xmath3-direction ) of the quasi-2d electron layer .",
    "we point out that the _ quantitative _ role of the layer width in the fqhe ( even in the lll ) has long been theoretically known@xcite .",
    "what we show in the current work , through the detailed comparison of theoretical numerical results in the @xmath24 lls obtained on an equal footing within the same model and approximation scheme , is that the higher ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) ll fqhe has fundamentally different qualitative dependence on the quasi-2d layer width parameter @xmath22 compared with the lll ( @xmath14 ) case . _ in particular , we find that a finite value of @xmath22 is essential in establishing the fqhe in higher lls whereas in the lll , finite @xmath22 only serves to quantitatively weaken the fqhe ! _",
    "the fqh states weaken ( strengthen ) in @xmath210 ( 1 ) lls as @xmath22 increases from the strictly 2d @xmath5 limit . in the tll ( @xmath20 ) , we do not find a stable fqhe at all , although our limited numerical results show similar trends in @xmath19 and @xmath20 lls .    the driving stimulus for studying",
    "the fqhe physics in the @xmath23 orbital lls is , of course , to shed light on the enigmatic @xmath26 fqhe , originally observed@xcite experimentally in 1987 and subsequently confirmed and further studied experimentally repeatedly@xcite over the last two decades .",
    "the great fundamental significance of the 5/2 fqhe can not be overstated . with the obvious exceptions of the original discoveries of the ( integer ) quantum hall effect itself@xcite and the subsequent 1/3 fqhe@xcite",
    ", the 5/2 fqhe may arguably be the next most important experimental discovery in the field .",
    "it is the _ only _ known ( so far ) exception ( for a single 2d layer system ) to the famous `` odd denominator '' rule for the fqhe , i.e. , the fqhe occurs at an odd denominator filling factor @xmath27 with @xmath28 an odd integer ( and @xmath29 either even or odd ) with a concomitant quantization of the hall conductance into a fractionally quantized hall conductivity @xmath30 and a zero ( or a deep minimum ) in the longitudinal conductivity @xmath31 ( and also in the longitudinal resistivity @xmath32^{-2}$ ] ) .",
    "all other ( i.e. , except for the 5/2 state in the sll ) observed fqhe states ( e.g. , @xmath33 in the lll ; @xmath34 in the sll ) strictly obey the odd denominator rule , but the @xmath26 state , with its well defined quantized hall conductance @xmath35 , stands in stark contrast to the odd denominator rule .",
    "we emphasize that the even denominator nature of the 5/2 fqhe is not only a curious anomaly , it challenges our understanding of the fqhe , as developed@xcite in the laughlin @xmath36 ( with @xmath28 an odd integer ) wavefunction and further developed in the jain composite fermion theory based wavefunctions@xcite for the @xmath27 type fqh states ( still with @xmath28 odd ) .",
    "the odd integer restriction of the filling factor denominator @xmath28 in the `` standard '' ( i.e. , laughlin - jain ) fqhe model is inescapable since it arises from the pauli exclusion principle for the electrons .",
    "any even - denominator fqhe must thus fall outside the standard laughlin - jain fqhe paradigm , and must somehow correspond to the condensation of bosons ( which do not obey pauli principle and therefore allow for even denominator fqhe ) in the @xmath26 incompressible fqh liquid .",
    "as an aside , it is worthwhile to mention that the 5/2 state is the only observed even - denominator fqhe , as emphasized above , only for _ single - layer _ 2d systems . in bilayer",
    "( or more generally , multilayer ) 2d systems , where experiments are carried out in two parallel 2d layers separated by a barrier ( i.e. , a double quantum well structure ) , even - denominator ( e.g. , @xmath37 , 1/4 ) fqh states have been observed  @xcite rather routinely . these bilayer fqh states",
    "are theoretically well - understood  @xcite to be strong - coupling paired laughlin states , which were postulated by halperin  @xcite some time ago .",
    "for example , the observed @xmath37 bilayer fqh state  @xcite has been shown  @xcite to be the halperin 331 state  @xcite , where tightly bound pairs of electrons condense into a bosonic laughlin state which is allowed to describe even - denominator fractions since the pauli principle does not apply to bosons .",
    "such strongly paired halperin even - denominator states are abelian states , similar to ordinary laughlin fqh states , in contrast to the moore - read non - abelian pfaffian even - denominator state  @xcite",
    "( see below ) which is thought to describe the weakly paired bcs state underlying the 5/2 single - layer even - denominator fqh state .",
    "we also mention here that no single - layer ( as opposed to bilayer ) @xmath37 fqhe has even been observed experimentally although we know of no fundamental reason ruling out such paired ( either strong - coupling or weak - coupling ) lll states .",
    "the leading theoretical candidate for the @xmath26 ( and its electron - hole counterpart at @xmath38 ) fqh state is the so - called `` pfaffian '' wavefunction@xcite of moore and read ( mr ) , which has been extensively studied over the last 17 years@xcite .",
    "in fact , there is no other proposed viable candidate ground state wavefunction for the observed 5/2 fqh state , and as such , a consensus has emerged that the moore - read pfaffian wavefunction is the likely description for the enigmatic even - denominator 5/2 fqhe . in spite of this consensus ,",
    "arising primarily out of a lack of any other viable alternative , there has been a minority viewpoint@xcite questioning the validity of the mr pfaffian in describing the 5/2 fqh ground state .",
    "in addition , a nagging issue of substantial importance is why there is an incompressible fqh state at half filling in the sll ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , but not at @xmath37 in the lll ( or for that matter , at half filling in the tll , i.e. @xmath40 ) since the pfaffian wavefunction carries no ll index label and is presumably an allowed variational description for the half - filled ll in any orbital level @xmath15 .",
    "important early work@xcite showed that the pfaffian wavefunction is a rather fragile description of the @xmath26 fqh state , and slight variations in the effective interaction between the carriers , as , for example , could arise from the finite layer width or from changing the orbital ll index could , in principle , affect the validity of the pfaffian wavefunction as a suitable description of the @xmath26 ground state .",
    "the `` mundane '' details of the dependence on the effective electron - electron interaction , rather than any deep fundamental principle , is , in fact , the reason for the sll 5/2 state to be an incompressible fqhe state whereas the corresponding lll 1/2 state is a compressible fermi liquid state .",
    "thus , the orbital ll and the finite layer thickness effects ( and also perhaps the inter - landau level coupling , an effect we uncritically ignore in this work ) on the effective electron - electron interaction are the key in determining the relative stability of various incompressible fqh states in different orbital lls .    in this work",
    ", we concentrate on three primary fqh states at filling factors 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/5 in three orbital lls @xmath24 , and theoretically investigate the relative stability of the incompressible quantized hall states at these fillings by calculating , as a function of the finite width parameter , the ground state wavefunction overlap between the _ exact _",
    "( numerically exactly diagonalized ) few - particle ground state wavefunction with the corresponding candidate variational wavefunction ( i.e. , laughlin for @xmath411/3 , 1/5 and mr pfaffian for @xmath37 ) for the incompressible fqh state . a high ( low ) overlap provides a strong hint that the corresponding realistic fqhe state is ( is _ not _ ) described by the corresponding variational state ( i.e. , laughlin for 1/3 , 1/5 and moore - read for 1/2 ) in the appropriate orbital ll .",
    "such exact diagonalization studies of small systems have been the main theoretical tool in learning about the nature of incompressible fqh states ever since the original discovery of the fqhe . in particular , the universal acceptance of the celebrated laughlin wavefunction as the appropriate description for the observed 1/3 fqh state in the lll is based almost entirely on the remarkably large ( essentially unity ) overlap between the analytical laughlin wavefunction and the exact small - system numerical wavefunction .",
    "similarly , the jain composite fermion theory based variational wavefunctions are thought to be excellent descriptions for the non - primary ( i.e. , @xmath42with @xmath43 and @xmath29 an integer  such as @xmath44 , 3/7 , 4/9 , etc . ) lll fqh states because of the good overlap between the composite fermion wavefunctions and exact numerical wavefunctions for small systems .",
    "even the mr pfaffian wavefunction is accepted to be the reasonable description for the experimental sll 1/2 state ( i.e. , at @xmath39 ) based simply on the observation , made originally by morf@xcite and followed up in other subsequent theoretical publications@xcite , that the pfaffian has good , albeit _ not _ spectacular , overlap ( @xmath450.8 - 0.9 for the strict 2d system ) with the exact small - system numerical wavefunction .",
    "conversely , alternative possibilities for the 5/2 fqhe state , such as the halperin 331 state  @xcite or the haldane - rezayi spin - singlet hollow - core  @xcite state , are ruled out  @xcite theoretically essentially entirely on the basis of very poor calculated overlap of these candidate states with exact small system numerical wavefunctions .",
    "another measure of the stability  besides the wavefunction overlap  that applies to the mr pfaffian state , in particular , is the appearance of the threefold topological degeneracy in the torus geometry that is a signature of the pfaffian state .",
    "this degeneracy is a direct signature of the non - abelian nature of the state ( and therefore would not arise if the state is abelian such as the halperin 331 state ) .",
    "the existence of this degeneracy for a physical interaction , i.e. , a modified coulomb interaction , has not been earlier reported in the literature .",
    "our finding of the appropriate mr degeneracy in the 5/2 numerical state precisely where the overlap is maximal is an important advance in theoretical understanding .",
    "we choose the laughlin ( for 1/3 and 1/5 ) and the pfaffian ( for 1/2 ) as our candidate variational ansatz because these are the _ only _ proposed incompressible fqh states at these primary fractional fillings .",
    "our work will , therefore , miss out on discovering any _ other _ possible ground state wavefunctions ( i.e. , other than laughlin for 1/3 and 1/5 and moore - read for 1/2 ) describing the experimental fqh state since we restrict our overlap calculations entirely to the laughlin or moore - read candidate states .",
    "this restriction is , however , not a serious drawback of our work since no other candidate wavefunctions exist in the literature for the fqh states of our interest .",
    "another incentive for our work comes from the fact that existing numerical work@xcite , much of it carried out in the idealized 2d limit , concludes that the 1/3 fqh state in the sll ( i.e. , the @xmath46 state or its electron - hole counterpart @xmath47 state ) is unlikely to be a simple laughlin state ( although in ref .",
    "the deviation from the laughlin wavefunction stems from residual quasiparticle interactions ) since the sll small - system exact diagonalization studies give only modest wavefunction overlap between the laughlin wavefunction and the exact numerical ground state in the sll . as mentioned above , for the 5/2 fqh state",
    ", the calculated overlap@xcite between the mr pfaffian and the exact diagonalization finite system wavefunction is also quite modest , much below unity , in the idealized 2d limit .",
    "our results would shed light on whether the finite - thickness , or width , of the quasi-2d layer enhances the overlap between the laughlin ( or moore - read ) state and the exact wavefunction so that the landau level dependent stability of the incompressible fqhe can be discussed in terms of a systematic tuning of the hamiltonian through the variation in the electron - electron interaction caused by changing the layer width parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we find that indeed a finite 2d layer width , i.e. , a true _ quasi_-2d system , is necessary for stabilizing the fqhe in the sll , at least within the restricted wavefunction space ( i.e. , laughlin and moore - read ) we investigate .",
    "we note that increasing @xmath22 from zero ( i.e. , the strict 2d ideal limit ) is equivalent to softening the interaction .",
    "one rather direct consequence of the quasi-2d finite - thickness effect on the fqhe is the _",
    "orbital _ coupling of an in - plane ( i.e. , parallel to the 2d layer ) applied magnetic field , in addition to the quantizing perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "having both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields is , of course , equivalent to having a tilted magnetic field , which is often used in 2d physics to study spin polarization effects  the idea being that the parallel component of the magnetic field couples only to the electron spin through the modification of the zeeman energy .",
    "this is certainly true in the idealized strictly 2d limit where a magnetic field in the 2d plane has _ no _ coupling to the orbital 2d dynamics of the electrons , but does couple to the electron spin . in a quasi-2d system , however , the situation is more complex since an in - plane field could , in principle , couple to the quasi-2d orbital dynamics of the electrons through the finite - thickness of the electron layer .",
    "one effect of the parallel field would , for example , be to squeeze the electron layer in the third direction , reducing its effective quasi-2d layer width .",
    "we consider such magneto - orbital coupling effects due to a parallel applied field in our work within the context of our ll - dependent finite - thickness studies , using a parabolic or simple harmonic confinement model .    a compelling and timely reason for the detailed investigation of higher ll fqhe is the recent interest in using the @xmath26 ( and possibly @xmath48 , recently observed by xia , et al in ref .  , and",
    "@xmath49 ) fqh states for fault - tolerant topological quantum computation  @xcite using the non - abelian quasiparticles associated with the pfaffian state .",
    "since the non - abelian nature of the quasiparticle excitations is crucially tied to the specific form of the mr pfaffian wavefunction , it is important that we know whether the observed 5/2 state is really the moore - read state or not .",
    "recently , serious questions have been raised  @xcite about whether the pfaffian is the appropriate description for the 5/2 state .",
    "our work , investigating the detailed nature of the incompressibility as a function of the quasi-2d layer width parameter in higher lls , thus is timely and necessary for further progress in the subject of topological quantum computation .",
    "there have also been several recent experimental investigations of the sll fqhe motivated by topological quantum computation considerations  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - hamil ] we introduce the essential hamiltonians we are studying , namely , the electron - electron interaction hamiltonian and ones that give either the laughlin or pfaffian states as zero - energy ground states . in section  [ sec - ft ]",
    "we describe the various models used to characterize the quasi-2d nature of the experimental quantum confinement , i.e. the `` finite - thickness '' models for various physical systems .",
    "the @xmath50- and @xmath51-functions ( defined below ) are then considered in section  [ fg - funcs ] as a first attempt to understand the effective electron - electron interaction due to the quasi-2d nature of the system .",
    "overlaps between the exactly diagonalized system for the `` realistic '' quasi-2d system and the laughlin ( fillings 1/3 and 1/5 ) or pfaffian ( filling 1/2 ) wavefunction as a function of the quasi-2d layer width are reported in section  [ overlaps1 ] .",

    "[ sec - topo ] .",
    "the effect of an in - plane magnetic field _ and _ the quasi-2d nature of the system are considered in section  [ sec - ip ] . in section  [ contour - sec ]",
    "we discuss connections of our overlap results to previous work and , in particular , whether or not the physics of the fqhe is adequately captured by the first few pseudopotentials .",
    "the finite thickness effects on the excitation gaps are also briefly discussed in section  [ sec - gap ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section  [ conc ] with some additional discussions .",
    "a short letter reporting some of our results has recently appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we consider spin polarized electrons entirely confined ( i.e. , no inter - ll coupling ) to a landau level of index @xmath14 ( lll ) , @xmath52 ( sll ) , and @xmath53 ( tll ) interacting through a pair potential @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the distance between two electrons ( distance is measured in units of magnetic length @xmath56 ) .",
    "since the electrons are confined to a single ll the kinetic energy is a constant , therefore , the hamiltonian for @xmath57 electrons is taken to be the interaction hamiltonian @xmath58    haldane  @xcite showed how this hamiltonian can be parameterized by the relative angular momentum @xmath59 between two electrons , through an expansion in the `` pseudopotential '' functions @xmath60 , which serve as a complete set of basis functions due to angular momentum conservation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an operator that projects onto the states of relative angular momentum @xmath63 . since we are considering spin polarized fermions only odd pseudopotentials are relevant .",
    "the haldane pseudopotentials @xmath60 for electrons confined to a ll with index @xmath64 , in the planar geometry ( as opposed to the spherical geometry ) , are written as @xmath65 ^ 2 l_m(k^2)e^{-k^2}v(k ) \\label{hald - pp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are laguerre polynomials , and @xmath67 is the fourier transform of the interaction potential @xmath68 . to define our fourier transform convention we write @xmath69 this parameterization allows all the calculations to be done entirely within the hilbert space of the lowest landau level , i.e. , the information about higher lls is completely contained within the @xmath60 .",

    "figure  [ vms - coulomb ] displays the first six pseudopotentials as a function of @xmath59 for the lll , the sll , and the tll .",
    "although the differences between the pseudopotentials in different lls are small quantitatively , the qualitative changes in the system behavior can be severe , as discussed below .",
    "the main qualitative difference in the pseudopotentials @xmath60 among the three lls is that @xmath75 , but @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "there is no known two - body interaction hamiltonian which has the pfaffian state as the ground eigenstate , so we should think of the pfaffian as a variational ansatz for our two - body interaction hamiltonians .",

    "finite thickness changes all the @xmath288 s but we are only showing the path traced out in the @xmath285-@xmath287 or @xmath285-@xmath298 or @xmath287-@xmath298 pseudopotential space of the contour plot .",
    "two main observations can be made in the parameters space of @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath292 .",
    "first , there are always regimes where the overlap is above 0.99 . that this occurs in the @xmath290 space",
    "is not particularly surprising considering the previous work of rezayi - haldane  @xcite ( although this is shown here for the first time in the spherical geometry ) .",
    "however , the other two contour plots in the @xmath291 and @xmath292 spaces go against the conventional wisdom . in particular , fig .",
    "[ contour - v3v5 ] shows that a large overlap with the pfaffian can be obtained by leaving @xmath285 constant and varying @xmath287 and @xmath298 only .",
    "hence , it is clear that the first two pseudopotentials do not dominate the physics of the 5/2 fqhe .",
    "the second observation that can be gleaned is that , since the values of _ all _ the pseudopotentials change upon including finite thickness effects , one can not parameterize finite thickness corrections in terms of only two pseudopotentials , be they the first and third , first and fifth , third and fifth , or any other combinations of two . this effect is clearly shown in the right panel of each contour plot where the path of the overlap , as a function of finite width , in the @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath292 plane , respectively , does not coincide with a high overlap region shown in the contour plot when _ only _ changing two pseudopotentials .",
    "note that the squares of the finite thickness overlap results are shaded according to the color contour plot on the left panel ( as well as being more clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ overlaps-12 ] ) .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that the investigation of the overlap as a function of changes ( or ratios ) between two pseudopotentials does not elucidate the physics of the 5/2 state and produces ambiguous results .",
    "in particular , in the inset of fig.5 of rezayi - haldane  @xcite the path of the finite thickness is plotted in the @xmath290 plane and shown to cross a boundary between a striped state and a paired fqhe state . however , from the above considerations , one can not conclude that the effects of finite thickness drive the system across boundaries in this way .",
    "specifically , finite thickness corrections involve variations in _ all _ the pseudopotentials from the ideal coulomb point , and tuning one or even a few pseudopotentials does not , under any circumstances , mimic the finite thickness effect .",
    "tuning one or two pseudopotentials around the coulomb point in order to study the stability of the 5/2 fqhe state with respect to the pfaffian is , therefore , somewhat misleading in our opinion , particularly since , unlike the lll laughlin states , there is no theoretical two - body hamiltonian for which the pfaffian is an exact ground state .",
    "the fqhe transport activation gap can be readily measured experimentally and is an extremely relevant quantity that characterizes the incompressibility of a fqh state . in this section",
    "we discuss the effects of finite thickness on the excitation gaps for the fqhe at @xmath281 and 5/2 .",
    "usually the experimental activation gap and the theoretical excitation gap are considered to be the same although this may not be necessarily true in the presence of disorder .",
    "it is , however , well - accepted that larger fqhe gaps imply stronger fqh states associated with larger fqhe excitation energies .    for finite size systems",
    "there are a few ways to calculate the gap and we only consider the gap in the spherical geometry . the gap is considered to be the energy of a well separated quasiparticle - quasihole pair where the initial ground state is incompressible",
    "hence , one only considers the excitation gap if the ground state of the @xmath57 particle system at flux @xmath144 is a uniform state with total angular momentum @xmath149 .",
    "if this is the case then the excitation gap can be calculated as the energy of a quasiparticle @xmath299 and a quasihole @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the ground state energy of a system of @xmath57 electrons at flux @xmath144hence , the quasihole state has @xmath302 while the quasiparticle has @xmath303 . with these energies",
    "the gap is given as @xmath304 .",
    "note that this definition involves only calculations of ground state energies albeit at different flux values .",
    "another way to find the gap is to calculate the energy of the @xmath57 electron system at flux @xmath144 as a function of angular momentum @xmath143 .",
    "the ground state ( again only if the state is uniform and thus incompressible ) will have @xmath149 , and a branch of low energy excited states at different @xmath305 .",
    "the gap is then given as the energy in the long wavelength limit which corresponds to the lowest energy excitation with @xmath306 for the state at @xmath281 and @xmath307 for the , presumably , paired state at @xmath26 . in other words , @xmath308 where @xmath309 ( @xmath310 ) for filling factor 7/3 ( 5/2 ) .",
    "this definition involves obtaining the low - energy spectra of the system at a given @xmath144 .",
    "this is the method we use in this work to investigate the gap .",
    "the reason is that , as discussed by morf  @xcite and in ref .",
    ", the first method , described above , leads to some ambiguity .",
    "this is because for @xmath26 and @xmath294 electrons the quasiparticle state is aliased to a fqhe state with filling factor @xmath311 in the sll .",
    "thus , what is being assumed as the quasiparticle energy from the 5/2 fqh state may in fact be a 2/3 filled incompressible fqh state . since we are also not calculating the gap in the thermodynamic limit , it is not particularly important which method we use since we are only interested in broad qualitative features .",
    "see refs .   and   for more thorough numerical investigations of the energy gaps in the fqhe .",
    "we emphasize that our results are only qualitative and should not be compared quantitatively with experimental activation gaps .    in figs .",
    "[ gap-52 ] and  [ gap-73 ] we plot the calculated gap for @xmath26 and 7/3 for the sq model for systems with @xmath294 and 6 electrons , respectively .",
    "the left panel shows the gap versus the width @xmath102 and the right panel shows the gap versus @xmath103 , both in units of @xmath56 .",
    "the solid line is the gap @xmath312 in units of @xmath313 , and we see that for both filling factors the gap ( in units of @xmath313 ) decreases with increasing width ( in units of @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the scale of the energy itself is being reduced as the coulomb energy is suppressed below @xmath313 in the presence of finite thickness , e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ vms ] where the pseudopotentials themselves are shown to decrease with increasing width .",
    "in fact , this introduces a subtle point when considering the theoretical energy gap including finite thickness effects . for every value of @xmath102",
    "we are , essentially , considering a different hamiltonian , so it is not quite appropriate to think of the gap as a function of the well width .",
    "this is most clear when one considers that the energy scale itself is changing with @xmath102 . to readily incorporate the effect of a varying energy scale with varying @xmath102 we should rescale the gap energy .",
    "the dashed lines in the left ( right ) panels of figs .",
    "[ gap-52 ] and  [ gap-73 ] show the gap in units of @xmath314 ( @xmath315 ) . in these units",
    "the gap is seen to increase with increasing width , i.e. , in reduced energy units , the excitation gap is enhanced with increasing width .",
    "we note that two alternative , and not necessarily equivalent , signatures exist for the theoretical characterization of the stability or the strength or the robustness of fqh incompressible states .",
    "these are ( 1 ) the overlap between the ground state finite - size numerical wavefunction and a candidate incompressible state , and , ( 2 ) the fqh excitation gap calculated directly numerically .",
    "the relationship between these two signatures of incompressibility is not obvious at all , and both definitions have their problems . the definition of the excitation gap is ambiguous ( particularly due to the aliasing problem ) since the two ways of defining it , as discussed above ( using the ground state energy at different @xmath144 and the excitation spectra at the same @xmath144 ) , are inequivalent . also , a finite size system always has discrete energy levels , and thus always has a gap .",
    "in addition , the excitation energy @xmath312 , being an energy , is by definition _ not _ dimensionless , and therefore is somewhat problematic as a signature for the ground state compressibility .",
    "( for reasons discussed above , we believe that the widespread practice of expressing @xmath312 in units of @xmath313 , the so - called coulomb energy , is arbitrary , and @xmath316 may not necessarily be a faithful representation of the stability of ground state incompressibility , particularly in situations , e.g. , 5/2 state , where finite quasi-2d width is essential for the existence of the fqhe . ) on the other hand , the signature of the overlap with a candidate analytical incompressible state ( i.e. , a variational ansatz such as the laughlin or the mr wavefunction ) has several intrinsic problems : ( 1 ) such an analysis is necessarily limited by the constraint of the variational ansatz , i.e. , if a different ( unknown ) incompressible state describes the ground state better , the overlap calculation would miss that ; ( 2 ) finite - size effects inherent in small system calculations , where a large overlap may turn out to be a misleading finite - size artifact ; ( 3 ) the competition with nearby compressible states is not captured .",
    "it is our contention that when one investigates the fqhe theoretically at some filling factor @xmath157 it is most illuminating to first determine the nature of the state responsible for the fqhe .",
    "this is usually done via an overlap calculation with some trial wavefunction ( laughlin , composite fermion , mr pfaffian , etc . ) such as was done in sec .",
    "[ overlaps1 ] .",
    "once a satisfying identification is made for the fqh ground state using the wavefunction overlap signature then experimentally relevant quantities , such as the excitation gap , can be calculated and compared with experiment .",
    "in fact , this is essentially the historical record of events following the discovery of the @xmath80 fqhe and subsequent explanation by laughlin .",
    "this is also the strategy we have followed in the current work .",
    "in this work , we investigate the relative stability of the fqhe at the most important primary filling factors @xmath411/2 , 1/3 , and 1/5 in the three lowest orbital landau levels @xmath14 ( lll ) , 1 ( sll ) , and 2 ( tll ) by calculating , as a function of the quasi-2d layer width parameter , the wavefunction overlap between the directly diagonalized exact many - body wavefunction ( for small spherical systems ) with the corresponding candidate theoretical ansatz for incompressible states , namely , the laughlin wavefunction for @xmath80 and 1/5 and the mr pfaffian wavefunction for @xmath37 .",
    "rather surprisingly , we find the layer thickness parameter , often neglected in theoretical studies of the fqhe mostly carried out in the idealized zero - thickness strict 2d limit , to be a key parameter in stabilizing the incompressible states in the sll . in particular , we find that the sll states at @xmath46 and @xmath317 have larger exact overlap with the corresponding theoretical incompressible states for finite values of the layer thickness parameter @xmath102 ; typically , the overlap is maximum ( of the order of unity , in fact ) for @xmath3184 - 5 in the sll whereas in the lll the overlap decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath216 , i.e. , the incompressibility is the strongest at @xmath203 ( note that the width parameter @xmath319 is the `` normalized '' width parameter , and @xmath296 only for the square - well confinement potential ) .",
    "furthermore , we also find that finite width is essential to the observation of the threefold degenerate ground state signature of the mr pfaffian state in the torus geometry .",
    "in particular , the expected threefold non - abelian topological degeneracy for @xmath26 only shows up on the torus for @xmath320-@xmath321 , where the corresponding overlap with the mr wavefunction is optimal . in the tll ,",
    "the overlap is always ( i.e. , for any @xmath216 ) very small , indicating the essentially generic absence of incompressible fqh states in @xmath322 orbital lls .",
    "our finding of the `` absence '' ( i.e. , small overlap ) of the laughlin @xmath80 state in the @xmath203 limit in the sll is consistent with earlier theoretical work carried out in the ideal @xmath203 limit  @xcite .",
    "the experimental fqhe observations  @xcite at @xmath281 and @xmath323 occur , of course , at finite values of @xmath216 , and the experimental values of @xmath216 in the real samples is @xmath3182 - 5 , which is in agreement with our theoretical finding .",
    "our work indicates that tuning the quasi-2d width parameter significantly ( either far above or below the optimal value where the overlap is maximum ) should destroy incompressibility at @xmath281 ( or @xmath323 ) .    the most important motivation for studying the sll fqhe is to understand the nature of the enigmatic 5/2 fqh state , the only even - denominator fqh state ever observed in single - layer 2d systems",
    "what does our work imply for the stability of the anomalous fqhe at half - filling ?",
    "we briefly discuss below the qualitative answer to this question .",
    "our work clearly shows the importance of the finite quasi-2d layer width in producing the incompressible fqh state at @xmath26 , assuming the state to be described by the mr pfaffian wavefunction which is the only available spin - polarized candidate wavefunction for the 5/2 state .",
    "consistent with earlier theoretical work in the literature  @xcite , we find the overlap between the exact ( small - system ) many - body wavefunction at @xmath26 to have a modest overlap ( @xmath450.8 - 0.9 ) with the pfaffian wavefunction , which increases monotonically to a large overlap of almost unity as @xmath216 increases . for larger @xmath216",
    ", the overlap decreases again .",
    "thus the behavior of the 5/2 state as a function of finite width is similar to the @xmath324 laughlin state  both are most stable at a finite layer width in contrast to the lll laughlin states at 1/3 and 1/5 , which are most stable ( i.e. , maximum overlap @xmath325 ) in the strict 2d ( @xmath326 ) limit .",
    "the behavior of the lll 1/2 state is interesting in this context .",
    "the overlap with the pfaffian here shows a very slight increase as a function of @xmath216 before decreasing again similarly to the sll 5/2 state except that the pfaffian overlap never approaches unity for the lll 1/2 state , indicating that an incompressible @xmath37 fqh state , at least one that is well - described by the mr pfaffian , is unlikely to occur in the lll .",
    "we emphasize that there is no compelling fundamental reason for the lll 1/2 state not manifesting a @xmath37 fqhe , it is merely absent in the reasonable parameter space of the coulomb interaction for realistic experimental systems .",
    "it is conceivable that a clever tuning of the interaction hamiltonian far from the strict 2d coulomb point will stabilize a lll @xmath37 fqhe corresponding to the mr pfaffian state .",
    "the @xmath113 state in the sll ( i.e. , @xmath327 ) is very similar to the lll fqh states in its dependence on the layer width . the overlap with the laughlin state decreases monotonically with increasing width parameter , implying that both the lll and sll 1/5 fqhe would be the strongest in the strict 2d ideal limit for zero layer thickness , similar to the situation for the @xmath80 lll state .",
    "our work indicates that , in principle , wavefunction engineering should be possible to enhance the fqhe at @xmath26 and 7/3 in the sll by increasing the quasi-2d width parameter @xmath216 . a trivial way of enhancing @xmath216 is , of course , to decrease @xmath56 ( at fixed @xmath102 ) by increasing the magnetic field . since increasing the magnetic field @xmath2 increases the interaction energy @xmath328 ,",
    "it is obvious that this would strengthen the fqhe trivially ( the energy gap scales as @xmath329 thus increasing the gap ) . but increasing magnetic field while keeping @xmath157 fixed requires a proportional increase in the carrier density which is problematic ( and may lead to the occupancy of the second subband , reducing the sample mobility substantially ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that @xmath102 should also be increased to produce enhanced stabilization of the sll fqhe .",
    "the fact that different models of quasi-2d confinement , e.g. , heterostructure ( fang - howard ) , square - well , parabolic quantum confinement , and the zhang - das sarma model , all give very similar qualitative and quantitative variation of our calculated overlap with the width parameter indicates that our qualitative conclusion is model independent , and applies to all quasi-2d physical systems where the fqhe is experimentally studied .    as a direct consequence of the layer width dependence of the fqhe found in this work",
    ", we also consider the experimentally important situation  @xcite of the effect of an in - plane magnetic field , @xmath265 , applied parallel to the quasi-2d layer on the fqhe . assuming the system to be completely spin - polarized , as we do throughout this work , and neglecting all disorder effects ( i.e. , ignoring for the moment that @xmath265 could cause additional scattering  @xcite by inducing coupling between in - plane and transverse dynamics ) , the only effect of @xmath265 is to modify the quasi-2d layer width @xmath102 by shrinking it to @xmath330 .",
    "this in - plane magnetic field induced modification of the quasi-2d layer width arises from the magneto - orbital coupling between in - plane and transverse electron dynamics in a finite - width system , which is strictly absent in the ideal 2d limit where , in the absence of spin ( i.e. , for a completely spin - polarized system ) , there can be no coupling between the in - plane and the transverse motion .",
    "we show that in a quasi-2d system , the in - plane field @xmath265 could destabilize the sll 5/2 pfaffian state by decreasing the effective layer width through the reduction of the overlap between the exact wavefunction and the pfaffian wavefunction .",
    "this follows naturally from our finding that in the sll , the reduction of the quasi-2d layer width always reduces the overlap of the 5/2 state and since @xmath265 reduces the effective value of the layer width it would naturally suppress the overlap at @xmath26 .",
    "the same is also true for @xmath281 , but _ not _ for @xmath162 in the sll or for @xmath411/3 or 1/5 in the lll since the latter three fqh states are the most robust ( i.e. , maximum overlap ) at the smallest value of @xmath102 .",
    "we therefore predict that , to the extent the 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/5 fqh states are completely spin - polarized , the application of a parallel magnetic field is likely to weaken the @xmath415/2 and 7/3 fqh states and strengthen the @xmath4111/5 , 1/3 , and 1/5 fqh states .",
    "of course , the physical effects neglected in our approximation ( e.g. , spin , landau level coupling , disorder ) could play important roles in actual experiments , but we suggest careful experiments in an applied in - plane field to validate ( or falsify ) our prediction of the weakening ( strengthening ) of the 5/2 , 7/3 ( 11/5 ) fqhe in the sll .",
    "we mention that the quantitative effect of the in - plane field depends strongly on @xmath331 and @xmath332 where @xmath333 and @xmath56 and @xmath102 are the 2d magnetic length and the @xmath334 value of the width , respectively .",
    "since @xmath331 and @xmath332 both should be not too large for the orbital influence of the in - plane field to be observable , it may not be easy to observe the predicted effect in the lll ( or even for the 11/5 sll ) since the typical `` @xmath56 '' is rather small for these cases .    before concluding we summarize the large number of approximations we have made in our theory : ( 1 ) we have assumed a spin - polarized system throughout , and",
    "therefore if spin is playing an important dynamical role in any of the fractional states we study , then our results would not be particularly useful in understanding the corresponding experimental observations .",
    "( 2 ) we have neglected the landau level coupling throughout our work , and it is possible that the ll coupling plays a role in the sll fqhe  @xcite . ( 3 ) we have neglected all disorder effects  in particular , the application of the in - plane parallel field may introduce additional `` disorder '' by opening new channels of scattering ( e.g. , intersubband scattering ) through the coupling of the in - plane and transverse dynamics .",
    "this will then serve to further weaken the 5/2 and 7/3 fqhe in the presence of the in - plane field .",
    "we expect such scattering effects to be very weak in the @xmath335 and @xmath336 regime of experimental interest .",
    "( 4 ) we have uncritically assumed that the `` strength '' of the incompressibility at a given filling factor ( or equivalently , the robustness of the fqhe at a given fraction ) is determined by the calculated overlap between the exactly diagonalized numerical wavefunction for small system sizes and the corresponding candidate theoretically postulated fqh state , i.e. , the laughlin wavefunction for @xmath337 ( in _ all _ lls ) and the mr pfaffian wavefunction for @xmath37 ( in _ all _ lls ) .",
    "( 5 ) related to the last point , our work will completely fail if the actual state describing the fqhe at a particular fraction is qualitatively different from our assumed candidate wavefunctions .",
    "for example , one can not , as a matter of principle , rule out the possibility , unlikely as it may seem , that the observed @xmath26 fqh state is the mr pfaffian state for finite @xmath3184 - 5 , as we find , which continuously and adiabatically goes over to some other unknown incompressible state at lower values of @xmath216 .",
    "such a continuous crossover implies that the observed 5/2 fqhe will remain strong and robust for all values of @xmath102 , but our calculated overlap with just the pfaffian decreases as @xmath216 decreases .",
    "we believe such a scenario to be extremely unlikely , particularly since there are no other proposed wavefunctions for 5/2 , but we can not rule this out on purely theoretical grounds .",
    "( the same also applies for the 7/3 state where , if anything , such a scenario of two distinct states , laughlin for layer @xmath216 and `` something else '' for smaller @xmath216 , seems even more unlikely . )",
    "( 6 ) we have used approximate models for considering the finite layer width in the quasi-2d system .",
    "however , the fact that four distinct models of quasi-2d systems produce essentially identical results and conclusions indicate that our results should have qualitative and semi - quantitative validity in real samples .",
    "also , earlier theoretical work  @xcite indicates that more sophisticated models of quasi-2d confinement do not lead to appreciable changes in the fqhe numerical results compared with the relatively simple models used in our work .",
    "( 7 ) we have utilized the standard spherical geometry for our finite size diagonalization using rather modest system sizes ( number of electrons between 5 and 10 depending on the filling factor ) .",
    "we believe that the small system size of our exact diagonalization study is not a problem since we are not attempting any quantitative estimates of the excitation gap ( or other experimental quantities ) , but are interested in the qualitative dependence of the overlap as a function of the layer width in different lls .",
    "one reason for our use of relatively modest system size is , of course , computational ease ( since we are producing a very large amount of numerical data : four different models of confinement , and three different lls , for three different fqh states , i.e. , 36 sets of diagonalization done as a function of the width parameter @xmath102 ! ) .",
    "yet a second important reason for our choice of system sizes is to avoid the well - known `` aliasing '' problem on the sphere where two distinct fractions occur together exactly at the same parameter values .",
    "we have only chosen system sizes where the aliasing issue does not arise .",
    "the fact that we study three different orbital lls on an equal footing to compare the relative qualitative stability of the 1/3 , 1/5 and 1/2 states gives us confidence in our numerically obtained trends ( as a function of @xmath102 ) and conclusions , if not the precise numbers .",
    "finally , we emphasize an important qualitative finding of our work .",
    "we find that , in contrast to the laughlin states ( e.g. , @xmath80 ) in the lll where increasing the first pseudopotential @xmath150 compared with the coulomb value necessarily strengthens the fqhe in a theoretically and physically meaningful manner , no such simple pseudopotential adjustments ( either a single pseudopotential , e.g. , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 or arbitrary combinations of them , e.g. , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 ) make sense for studying the fqhe stability in higher ( sll or tll ) orbital landau levels .",
    "this is because of the theoretical fact that the @xmath182 laughlin state becomes and _ exact _ lll eigenstate of the effective two - body hamiltonian @xmath181 ( see eq .",
    "[ laugh - h ] ) where all pseudopotentials @xmath341 are taken to be zero , e.g. , the laughlin 1/3 state is just an exact lll eigenstate of the coulomb interaction if @xmath342 .",
    "this mathematical simplicity provides an adiabatic connection between the laughlin state and the exact @xmath80 fqh state even in the realistic system as long as @xmath150 is _ not _ too `` small '' .",
    "this mathematical simplicity is , however , completely lost in higher orbital lls where the exact state can not simply be written down in this manner . in particular",
    ", the @xmath26 even - denominator state in the sll , if it is indeed the moore - read pfaffian state , is _ not _ an eigenstate of any ( even a completely unrealistic ) two - body hamiltonian . as such",
    ", trying to understand the nature of the 5/2 state by varying the few lower pseudopotentials ( e.g. , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , etc . ) around the coulomb point is not mathematically ( or physically ) well - motivated since no two - body hamiltonian exists with the mr state as its exact ground state .",
    "we have therefore adopted the physically motivated approach in this work by working directly with the realistic hamiltonian including the quasi-2d finite thickness effects ( instead of using unrealistic arbitrary variations in the pseudopotentials ) .",
    "varying the finite quasi-2d layer thickness involves changes in _ all _ the pseudopotentials which can not be mimicked by varying any one or two pseudopotentials only .",
    "we find that this physical approach leads to a rather unexpected finding : while in the lll , finite quasi-2d thickness always weakens the fqhe , in the sll , the finite thickness may actually stabilize the fqhe , for example , at @xmath26 and 7/3 filling factor .    in summary , we have theoretically considered the effect of orbital dynamics on the stability of the primary fqh states at 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/5 filling factors by calculating the wavefunction overlap ( and the topological degeneracy expected for the mr pfaffian state ) as a function of the quasi-2d layer width ( @xmath102 ) in @xmath14 ( lll ) , 1 ( sll ) , and 2 ( tll ) orbital lls , finding that the fqhe does not occur in the tll ( for any value of the quasi-2d width parameter ) , is the most robust at @xmath203 in the lll and for the 11/5 state in the sll , and is the most robust at @xmath3184 - 5 in the sll for the 5/2 and 7/3 state .",

    "<S> , we show the appearance of the characteristic threefold topological degeneracy expected for the pfaffian state . </S>",
    "<S> this signature is enhanced by nonzero thickness corroborating our findings from overlap calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our results have ramifications for _ wavefunction engineering _ , opening the possibility of creating an optimal experimental system where the 5/2 fqhe state is more likely described by the moore - read pfaffian state with obvious applications in the burgeoning field of fault - tolerant topological quantum computing . </S>"
