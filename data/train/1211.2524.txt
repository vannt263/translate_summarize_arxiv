    "mn - ga ordered alloys with tetragonal distortion , which are primarily used in spintronics applications , are known to possess high magnetic anisotropy ; ( _ k_@xmath9 ) @xcite this property of mn - ga alloys is essential ro the retention of stored data in spintronics - based memory devices with nanometer - scale elements . in addition , materials with high spin polarization@xcite and small gilbert damping constant ( @xmath10)@xcite are also particularly attractive for realizing spin - transfer - torque ( stt)-type magnetoresistive random access memory ( mram).@xcite the primary issue to be addressed in mram applications is to reduce the critical current ( _ i_@xmath11 ) required to cause stt - induced magnetization switching . the current _",
    "i_@xmath11 is proportional to the damping constant @xmath10 and the saturation magnetization ( _ m_@xmath12 ) of the free layer present in the magnetic tunnel junctions of the mram,@xcite and thus magnetic material with small _ m_@xmath12 value is important as well . _",

    "therefore , we investigated structural , magnetic and transport properties of mn - co - ga films in this study .",
    "all the films were prepared by using an ultra - high - vacuum magnetron sputtering system .",
    "the stacking structure of the samples was follows : mgo(100 ) substrate / mn - co - ga ( 100 nm)/mgo(2 nm)/al(2 nm ) .",
    "the mn - co - ga layer was deposited via a co - sputtering technique from a mn - ga alloy target and an elemental co target .",
    "the substrate was heated to 500@xmath16c during deposition . in this study , primarily focused on the co content dependences of structural , magnetic , and electric properties , and thus , the film compositions under investigations were mn@xmath17ga@xmath18 , mn@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 , mn@xmath0co@xmath19ga@xmath8 , mn@xmath6co@xmath7ga@xmath8 , mn@xmath20co@xmath21ga@xmath22 , and mn@xmath23co@xmath8ga@xmath24 ; the co content in the films was varied from 0 to 1.2 .",
    "the film compositions were determined by using inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) mass spectroscopy for mn@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 , mn@xmath0co@xmath19ga@xmath8 , and mn@xmath23co@xmath8ga@xmath24 .",
    "the compositions of the other films were estimated via the ratio of the sputtering power used for each of the targets .",
    "the structural and magnetic properties of the films were investigated by using an x - ray diffractometer ( xrd ) and a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) , respectively .",

    "the structural transition point of the film samples depending on the co content is consistent with that for bulk ones even though the present mn - ga composition used in our study ( mn@xmath17ga@xmath18 ) was different from the bulk one ( mn@xmath33ga@xmath24 ) , which implies that band dispersion is not very sensitive to the _ off - stoichiometry _ of the mn - co - ga alloys ; further tetragonal distortion occurs due to electronic instabilities corresponding to a band - type jahn - teller effect.@xcite     ( color online ) ( a ) lattice constants ( _ a_- and _ c_-axis ) and ( b ) _ c_/_a _ ratio as a function of co content , _",

    "the @xmath36 exhibited minimum value around the boundary between the tetragonal and cubic structures . on the other hand , the value of _ k_@xmath3 and _ h_@xmath37 did not widely differ for the samples with tetragonal structures .",
    "it is noteworthy that the magnetic moment ( @xmath36 ) of the mn@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 film was as small as 0.55@xmath44 ( @xmath45190 emu/@xmath4 ) at a large _ k_@xmath3 value of 9.2 merg/@xmath4 . in this case , @xmath36 was reduced to less than half of that for the film without co content , while a large _ k_@xmath3 close to 10 merg/@xmath4 was still maintained .",

    "the line serves as a visual guide .",
    "]    subsequently , the electrical resistivity ( @xmath46 ) of the mn - co - ga films was investigated ; the co - content dependence of resistivity is shown in fig . [ r ] .",
    "the @xmath46 value of mn@xmath17ga@xmath18 was of the same order as that of mn - ga films with different composition ratio.@xcite with increasing co content , @xmath46 correspondingly increased , and a maximum value of 490 @xmath5 cm was obtained for the mn@xmath6co@xmath7ga@xmath8 film . as the co content increased beyond 0.6 , the @xmath46 slightly decreased ; however it was still larger than that of pure mn@xmath17ga@xmath18 .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the co content dependence of @xmath46 for the mn - co - ga films .",
    "the dependence could be extrinsic ; films for co content of around 0.5 , the smoothness and continuity of the film become poor ; for e.g. , the roughness and peak - to - valley values of the mn@xmath6co@xmath7ga@xmath8 film were about 10 nm and 100 nm , respectively .",
    "these values were about 10 times larger than the corresponding value for the mn@xmath17ga@xmath18 film .",
    "thus , increased electron scattering due to the presence of discontinuities in the film might be one reason for the observed @xmath46 behavior .",
    "the other possibility is that the @xmath46 behavior is intrinsic to the chemical nature of the film .",
    "et al . _ have recently hypothesized that the chemical disordering of mn@xmath14ga alloy by mn - co substitution can cause localization of the minority - spin channel around the fermi level.@xcite they speculated that the electrical conductivity reduces because of the reduced mobility of electrons . according to their calculation , the localization is not sufficiently strong for the mn@xmath14ga and mn@xmath47coga cases , while the electrons are strongly localized in both tetragonal and cubic mn@xmath48co@xmath19ga compounds . in our study , the films with higher resistivity exhibit chemically disordered regions , and thus , such a localization can also be considered as the cause for the observed co content dependence of @xmath46 .",
    "epitaxially grown mn - co - ga tetragonal or cubic heusler compound thin films were successfully fabricated , and their structural , magnetic , and electrical transport properties were investigated .",
    "the dependences of lattice parameters and saturation magnetization on co content in the films were similar to those reported for bulk mn@xmath39co@xmath40ga compounds .",
    "a minimum saturation magnetization of 0.55@xmath44 ( @xmath45190 emu/@xmath4 ) was obtained for the mn@xmath0co@xmath1ga@xmath2 film at a large _ k_@xmath3 value of 9.2 merg/@xmath4 ; this magnetization value is acceptable in the light of future stt - mram applications .",
    "the resistivity of the mn - co - ga films was larger than that for pure mn - ga .",
    "the observed higher resistivity subsequent to co substitution might originate due to reduced electron mobility because of the presence of localized electron states around the fermi level ( intrinsic factor ) as well as due to increase in surface discontinuities of the film ( extrinsic factor ) .",
