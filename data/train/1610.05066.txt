    "<S> population dynamics is constrained by the environment , which needs to obey certain conditions to support population growth . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a standard model for the evolution of a single species population density , that includes reproduction , competition for resources and spatial spreading , while subject to an external harmful effect . </S>",
    "<S> the habitat is spatially heterogeneous , there existing a refuge where the population can be protected . </S>",
    "<S> temporal variability is introduced by the intermittent character of the refuge . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario can apply to a wide range of situations , from a lab setting where bacteria can be protected by a blinking mask from ultraviolet radiation , to large scale ecosystems , like a marine reserve where there can be seasonal fishing prohibitions . using analytical and numerical tools </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the total population as a function of the size and characteristic time scales of the refuge . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain expressions for the minimal size required for population survival , in the slow and fast time scale limits . </S>"
