    "atomic negative ions are representative of weakly - bound ( typically having binding energies one order of magnitude smaller than the neutral atoms or positive ions ) fragile quantum systems . due to the weak central field experienced by its outer valence electron , correlation is dominant and can no longer be treated as a small perturbation to the independent particle picture .",
    "thus faithful estimation of binding energies , fine structure or excitation energies of negative ions pose considerable challenges to theoreticians and experimentalists .",
    "for example , _ very good _ precision on total energy is necessary to obtain _ modest _ values of the electron affinity .",
    "an impressive amount of theoretical as well as experimental works have been reported in the literature ( see for example , @xcite for review ) during the past three decades and interest in this area continues to grow further .",
    "our focus is on the ground and excited states of negative ions of two most extensively studied systems ( after possibly h@xmath6 and he@xmath6 ) from alkali and alkaline - earth groups , _ viz . , _",
    "li , be . ever since the three long - lived bound states of li@xmath6 were reported through configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations @xcite , significant attention has been paid on their characterization and understanding .",
    "these three are respectively : the ground state [ he]2s@xmath0 @xmath1s@xmath2 and two core - excited high - spin metastable bound states , 1s2s2p@xmath0 @xmath3p@xmath2 , 1s2p@xmath4 @xmath3s@xmath5 , each lying below the corresponding 1s2s2p @xmath7p and 1s2p@xmath0 @xmath7p parent states of li . thereafter a host of calculations including multiconfiguration hartree - fock ( mchf ) @xcite , multiconfiguration interaction @xcite as well as the recent saddle - point @xcite , variational monte carlo ( vmc ) @xcite , and other methods have been employed to determine the upper bound , relativistic and nonrelativistic energy , transition wavelength , oscillator strength , lifetime , fine structure , hyperfine parameter , etc . , of these states . in general , these findings show good agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to li@xmath6 ground state , addition of a 2p electron to the ground state of be 1s@xmath02s@xmath0 yields an unbound be@xmath6 [ he]2s@xmath02p @xmath0p@xmath5 ground state ; however , three metastable states [ he]2s2p@xmath0 @xmath7p@xmath2 , [ he]2p@xmath4 @xmath7s@xmath5 and 1s2s2p@xmath4 @xmath8s@xmath5 were predicted , of which the first two have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations include a variety of methods , e.g. , superposition of configurations @xcite , ci @xcite , state - specific theory @xcite , mchf @xcite , full core plus correlation @xcite , rayleigh - ritz variation method @xcite , vmc @xcite , etc . , among others .",
    "in the last four decades , density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite has emerged as one of the most powerful and promising tools for electronic structure and dynamical studies of many - electron atoms , molecules , solids .",
    "while it enjoyed remarkable success for the ground states , same for excited states came much later .",
    "in the last decade , a work - function - based dft prescription has been shown to be fairly successful for _ general _ atomic excited states ( see for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this proposed the use of a nonvariational local work - function - based exchange potential @xcite , which is computationally advantageous compared to the nonlocal hf potential .",
    "usually , the gradient and laplacian - included correlation functional of lee - yang - parr ( lyp ) @xcite was employed in conjunction .",
    "recently this was extended for higher excitations through a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) implementation which allowed to solve the resultant radial ks equation in a non - uniform , optimal spatial grid accurately efficiently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this enabled us to study , for the first time , within the framework of dft , a broad range of important physical processes in atomic excited states such as multiple excitations , valence as well as core excitations , satellite states , high - lying rydberg states etc . however with the exception of 8 triply excited states of he@xmath6 @xcite , all of these works dealt with either neutral atom and cations .",
    "the current work aims at investigating the spectra of two most important and widely studied case of negative ions through the above dft method , with an objective to assess and judge the performance of this simple single - determinantal approach in the context of excited states of negative ions . in other words",
    "can a density - based approach as ours , produce satisfactory and physically meaningful results for these intricate excited states ; and if so how good do they perform in comparison to the traditional wave function - based methodologies , which are prevalent for their studies ? to answer these questions , we investigate the term energies , radial densities , transition wavelengths as well as expectation values of some position operators for 4 states of li@xmath6 , _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath1s@xmath2 , 1s2s2p@xmath0 @xmath3p@xmath2 , 1s2p@xmath4 @xmath3s@xmath5 , 1s2s2p3p @xmath3p@xmath2 , and 3 states of be@xmath6 , _ viz . , _ [ he]2s2p@xmath0 @xmath7p@xmath2 , [ he]2p@xmath4 @xmath7s@xmath5 and 1s2s2p@xmath4 @xmath8s@xmath5 .",
    "comparison with available theoretical and experimental results are made , wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section ii gives basic elements of the formalism as well as its numerical implementation , section iii makes a discussion on the results while we end with a few concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "the methodology as well as the numerical solution of the desired radial kohn - sham ( ks ) equation through gps discretization scheme has been presented before [ 23,24,27 - 31 ] ; hence not repeated .",
    "only essentials details are given . unless otherwise mentioned , atomic units employed throughout the article .",
    "our interest is in the following single - particle nonrelativistic ks equation , @xmath11 \\psi_i ( { \\mathrm { \\mathbf { r } } } ) = \\varepsilon_i \\psi_i ( { \\mathrm { \\mathbf { r}}})\\ ] ] where three terms in the left - hand side signify respectively the kinetic , electrostatic and exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy contributions . @xmath12",
    "contains the nuclear - attraction and classical internuclear coulomb repulsion as , @xmath13 where z corresponds to the nuclear charge .",
    "the local nonvariational exchange potential relates to the work required to move an electron against the electric field @xmath14 arising out of its own fermi - hole charge distribution , @xmath15 , and given by the line integral @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 for well - defined potentials , work done must be path - independent ( irrotational ) , which is rigorously satisfied for spherically symmetric systems .",
    "this potential can be calculated accurately as the fermi hole is known exactly in terms of the single - particle orbitals .",
    "working within the central - field approximation , @xmath18 , employing a suitable correlation functional ( here we use lyp potential , @xcite ) , solution of the ks equation produces a self - consistent set of orbitals , which gives the electron density as , @xmath19    the radial ks equation is solved accurately and efficiently by means of the gps method , which has shown remarkable success for structure and dynamics of coulombic singular systems such as atoms , molecules as well as other difficult and stronger singularities such as the spiked harmonic oscillators , hulthen and yukawa potentials etc . @xcite-@xcite . in most of these cases",
    ", this has either outperformed the best results published so far for those systems or offered results of comparable accuracy to the best calculations .",
    "this is achieved through the following steps : ( i ) approximate a function by an nth order polynomial ( we use legendre ) @xmath20 in such a way that the approximation is _ exact _ at collocation points @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 ( ii ) a transformation @xmath23 employed to map the semi - infinite domain @xmath24 $ ] onto the finite domain @xmath25 $ ] ( iii ) introducing an algebraic nonlinear mapping @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , followed by a ( iv ) symmetrization procedure .",
    "finally this leads to a _",
    "eigenvalue problem which can be easily diagonalized efficiently by using standard available libraries ( like nag ) to generate accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , for _ both _ low as well as higher levels .",
    "another notable feature is that this nonlinear optimal discretization maintains similar accuracy at _ both _ smaller and larger distances with significantly smaller number of points ( all calculations done with 250 radial points ) , than those needed in usual finite - difference or finite element methods but at the same time promises faster convergence .",
    "a convergence criterion of 10@xmath28 and 10@xmath29 a.u . was imposed for the potential and energy to obtain all the results presented here . by performing a series of test calculations , a consistent set of gps parameters",
    "were chosen ( @xmath30=25 , n=250 , @xmath31 a.u . ) which produced `` stable '' converged results .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] calculated total energies of ground and excited states of li@xmath6 , be@xmath6 along with the literature data .",
    "numbers in the parentheses denote absolute per cent deviations .",
    "see text for details . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "a density - based formalism was employed for the _ first _ time to calculate the state energies , radial density as well as selected density moments of three excited states of li@xmath6 and be@xmath6 in addition to the ground state of the former .",
    "a work - function - based exchange potential plus the nonlinear lyp correlation potential was used , while the resulting ks equation was numerically solved by an optimal , nonuniform , spatial gps discretization scheme accurately .",
    "additionally two transition wavelengths of li@xmath6 , be@xmath6 were computed .",
    "comparison with the existing theoretical as well as experimental data were made .",
    "for all practical purposes our x - only results are of hf quality and with correlation included , they produce excellent agreement with the literature data .",
    "the observed absolute per cent deviation in the term energies between our xc calculations and the correlated results in the literature remains within 0.007 - 0.171% only , and is mostly attributable to our current inadequate knowledge of the delicate correlation effects in these strongly - correlated systems , besides the fact that the presently employed lyp potential was designed primarily for the ground states .",
    "construction of the _ exact _ many - body correlation functional has been one of the most forefront areas of dft ever since its rejuvenation in the works of kohn - sham in 1964 and unfortunately still remains one of the most important unresolved issues in dft .",
    "however , even though its _ exact _ form remains elusive , many accurate forms have been proposed over the decades suitable for different processes in atoms , molecules , solids .",
    "note that this is a single - determinantal approach and is far more simpler to implement compared to the benchmark sophisticated and elaborate ci or multiconfiguration type formalisms within the traditional wave function based methodologies ; yet as our results indicate , this can lead to quite good - quality results , which of course is the appeal and usefulness of dft - based methods . at this stage , we note that , success of such a relatively simpler method on the present and previous atomic excited states done before , e.g. , in @xcite , may encourage one to explore its validity and applicability for other physical and chemical systems such as molecules .",
    "while this could lead to an attractive and direct route towards molecular excited states , as discussed earlier , ( see for example , @xcite and references therein ) , a straightforward extension is difficult ; as it relies on the tacit assumption of spherical symmetry in the density , which is not the case for molecules . finally ,",
    "while the lyp correlation potential employed has provided rather excellent results for the present inherently correlated systems and in past studies , nevertheless it is unclear whether the non - dynamical correlation contribution is described by lyp properly or for these states such contributions are small .",
    "no definitive answer is possible and more detailed and sophisticated studies would be required for this . in conclusion , we have proposed an accurate and reliable method for the excited states of negative atoms within the framework of dft .",
