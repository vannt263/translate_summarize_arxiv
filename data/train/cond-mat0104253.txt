    "the recent discovery of superconductivity with high @xmath7@xcite in mgb@xmath0 has initiated large activity in experimental as well as theoretical studies .",
    "nb@xmath8ge is long been the record holder of the highest @xmath7 among the intermetallic superconductors .",
    "the recently found ypd@xmath0b@xmath0c touches the same @xmath7 as nb@xmath8ge .",
    "the work of bednorz and mller@xcite in 1986 on the basis of copper oxides started the discovery of a rapidly increasing number of high-@xmath7 superconductors , among which the current record is held by hgba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 with @xmath7@xmath10 164k under pressure.@xcite during the past decade , remarkable progress in basic research and technological applications has been made on the high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductors .",
    "however the complex crystal structures in combination with the multicomponent nature of the materials involved hinder the full understanding of microscopic origin of high-@xmath7 superconductivity .",
    "hence it may be beneficial to study the properties of a simple compound like mgb@xmath0 in detail , which does not only have high @xmath7 , but also takes a simple crystal structure with @xmath11 electrons ( involved in the superconducting process ) that are easy to handle theoretically .    in cuprates",
    "it is now generally believed that the conductivity takes place in the cuo@xmath0 planes which , therefore , are essential to the high-@xmath7 superconductors . the observation of superconductivity with high @xmath7 in mgb@xmath0 releases the question of whether superconductivity with even higher @xmath7 can be found in intermetallics which do not comprise the characteristic cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "several properties of mgb@xmath0 appear closely related to high @xmath7 superconducting cuprates : a low electron density of states , a layered structural character and the presence of rather light atoms ( like oxygen in cuprates ) facilitate high phonon frequencies .",
    "further , although the electronic structure of this material has three - dimensional character , the b - b @xmath12 bands derived from b @xmath13 electrons ( believed to be important for the superconductivity ) reflect two - dimensional character . like the cuprates , mgb@xmath0 appears to exhibit hole conductivity , as evidenced from theoretical considerations@xcite and experimental hall coefficient measurement.@xcite another interesting aspect of the mgb@xmath0 structure is that it has negatively charged honeycomb - shaped b planes which are reminicent of highly negatively charged cu - o planes in the high-@xmath7 cuprates .",
    "it is often believed that the @xmath14 electrons play an important role for the superconducting behaviour of intermetallic compounds .",
    "so the experimental search for new superconductors has to a large extent been focussed on transition metal compounds .",
    "the back - ground for this is that transition metal compounds usually possess large density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( one of the ingredients required for high @xmath7 ) than the main - group metal ( @xmath11 ) compounds .",
    "the bcs superconductors usually possess larger dos at the fermi level ( @xmath2 ) and the high @xmath7 in conventional superconductors is related to the large @xmath15 values as well as the strong coupling of selected phonon modes to the electronic system .",
    "further , relatively high t@xmath16 in superconducting intermetallics are believed to be coupled to a van hove - like peak at @xmath2 in the dos curve , as predicted by various bandstructure calculations and indicated experimentally for ni - site substituted rare - earth nickel borocarbides.@xcite however in mgb@xmath0 there is no such peak - like feature at the vicinity of @xmath2 in the dos profile and hence one must search for some other origin of the superconductivity .",
    "mgb@xmath0 is a @xmath11 metal and hence its value of @xmath15 is small compared with that of superconducting transition metal compounds .",
    "further , the presence of light borons in mgb@xmath0 similar to oxygens in high-@xmath7 cuprates , indicates that some exotic mechanism is involved in the superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical studies@xcite show that the quasi two - dimensional b @xmath12 bands are strongly coupled with the @xmath17 phonon modes which would be consistent with the bcs mechanism .",
    "the experimentally observed isotope effect@xcite in mgb@xmath0 also indicates phonon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "but , as discussed by baskaran,@xcite the absence of hebel - slichter peak in the nmr relaxation,@xcite a temperature dependent peak around 17mev in the energy resolved neutron scattering,@xcite first order metal - to - metal transition on al or c substitution,@xcite apparently anomalous temperature dependences of the hall coefficient@xcite and london penetration depth@xcite and the need of small @xmath18 value to explain the experimentally observed high @xmath7 by the bcs theory@xcite indicate that the mechanism differs significantly from that of the bcs theory .    the discovery of new classes of quaternary intermetallic superconductors ; the borocarbide@xcite and the boronitride@xcite series , with relatively high @xmath7 ( up to 23 k for ypd@xmath0b@xmath0c@xcite ) has encouraged the search for superconductivity in materials possessing light atoms such as b , c , n , h etc . superconductivity with the t@xmath16 ranging 2@xmath194 k has been observed for ternary transition metal diborides ( yre@xmath0b@xmath0,lub@xmath0c@xmath0 , yb@xmath0c@xmath0)@xcite and it is also observed in magnetic rare - earth ( re ) rhodium borides ( rerh@xmath6b@xmath6@xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the layer - structure compounds @xmath20-zrncl and @xmath20-hfncl have been found to be superconducting upon li intercalation with @xmath7 = 12.5 and 25.5 k , respectively.@xcite another group of materials ( maximum @xmath7 = 9.97k reported@xcite for y@xmath0c@xmath0i@xmath0 ) is re carbide halide superconductors with c@xmath19c pairs located in octahedrally coordinated voids of close - packed re atoms .",
    "the recent discovery of superconductivity@xcite at @xmath2114k in the alb@xmath0-type phase of casi@xmath0 ( the highest @xmath7 ever obtained among the silicides ) indicates that the alb@xmath0-type structure may be favorable for superconductivity .",
    "there are several mechanisms proposed for high @xmath7 superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 and the like .",
    "one is based on band structure findings,@xcite which suggests that the superconducting state results from strong electron - phonon interaction and high phonon frequency associated with the light boron atom .",
    "this is supported by the recent observation of relatively large boron isotope effect on @xmath7.@xcite a recent high - pressure study@xcite shows that @xmath7 decreases with pressure at a rate of @xmath191.11k / gpa which is consistent with the bcs framework .",
    "it has been widely speculated that the low mass of boron is conducive for the occurrence of high phonon frequencies and consequently for high @xmath7 .",
    "another mechanism is called the `` universal '' by hirsch@xcite , and this conjectures that the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 ( similar to that in cuprate superconductors ) is driven by the pairing of the heavily dressed holes in bands that are almost full to gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb repulsion .",
    "a positive pressure effect on @xmath7 has also been predicted by hirsch when the pressure reduces the interatomic b@xmath19b distance .",
    "an and pickett@xcite maintain that the b @xmath12 bands are playing an important role in the superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 , and that the b in - plane @xmath17 phonon mode is strongly coupled to this band .",
    "contradictory to the above viewpoint , baskaran@xcite concluded from the resonance valence bond ( rvb ) theory that the two dimensional @xmath12 bands do not play a crucial role in establishing high @xmath7 superconductivity and @xmath22 band might interfere with superconductivity .",
    "mgb@xmath0 possesses a hexagonal crystal structure and hence one can expect anisotropy in the physical properties of this material . despite the strongly anisotropic layered hexagonal structure ,",
    "its electronic properties indicate three dimensionality and the calculated fermi velocity in the plane and perpendicular to the plane are almost the same .",
    "the theory for hole superconductivity@xcite suggests that a decrease in the b - b interatomic distance should increase @xmath7 .",
    "the rvb theory@xcite suggests that a increase in chemical pressure along the @xmath23 axis should decrease @xmath7 and ultimately convert the material to a normal metallic state . in order to test these possiblities",
    "it is important to know the anisotropy in mechanical properties . from high - pressure total energy studies",
    "loa and syassen@xcite concluded that mgb@xmath0 has isotropic compressibility . from a high - resolution x - ray powder diffraction high - pressure study along with the density functional calculation vogt _ et al._@xcite concluded that mgb@xmath0 possesses nearly isotropic mechanical behavior . from isothermal compressibility measurements by synchrotron x - ray diffraction prassides@xcite concluded that mgb@xmath0 is a stiff tightly - packed incompressible solid with only moderate bonding anisotropy between inter- and intralayer directions .",
    "however , jorgensen _ et al._@xcite found unusually large anisotropy in thermal expansion and compressibility from the neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "so , it is interesting to calculate the single - crystal elastic constants of mgb@xmath0 to identify the exact nature of the anisotropy .",
    "several attempts have been made to enhance @xmath7 by substitution of such as al,@xcite be,@xcite , zn@xcite and li,@xcite for mg and c@xcite for b but no practical progress has hitherto been obtained . moreover ,",
    "the role of mg and b site substitution on the electronic structure of mgb@xmath0 has been studied theoretically.@xcite so , it is interesting to search for compounds with an electronic structure similar to that of mgb@xmath0 . a systematic investigation of this and related materials is a way to learn the mechanism of superconductivity in this novel material and to identify materials with high t@xmath16 .",
    "knowledge of electronic structure , dos , debye temperature and related properties are important for assessing the mechanism and nature of superconductivity . in a search for superconducting diborides , beb@xmath0 is a promising candidate since the lighter be may help to provide larger phonon frequencies and hence increase @xmath7 . if the electron per atom ratio is important for the superconductivity in this class one should also consider cab@xmath0 and srb@xmath0 as interesting candidates . if it is the combination of mg and b which brings the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , one has to consider mgb@xmath6 also .",
    "if the number of electrons in the b layers is a key for superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , related layer - structured materials such as libc , mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 should be paid attention . for these reasons",
    "we have made detailed electronic structure studies for the above mentioned compounds .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the structural aspects and the computational details about the calculations of the electronic structure , optical spectra and the elastic constants",
    "are given in in sec.[sec : details ] .",
    "in sec.[sec : resdis ] we have analyzed the bonding behavior of mgb@xmath0 using the orbital and site projected dos , crystal orbital overlap hamiltonian population ( cohp ) , charge density analysis etc .",
    "the electronic band structure of mgb@xmath0 is calculated and compared with that of closely related systems and also analyzed the possible connection between the electronic structure and the superconductivity .",
    "the elastic and the optical anisotropy of this material are calculated and compared with available experimental results .",
    "finally we summarize the important findings of the present study in sec.[sec : con ] .",

    "the structure of mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 ( fig.[fig : str]b ) contains graphite - like but slightly puckered boron - carbon layers whose charge is counter - balanced by mg@xmath27 cations .",

    "the average b - b distance in the pentagonal pyramid is 1.787 . whenever possible we have used the experimental lattice paramenters for our calculation ,",

    "self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath34ry / cell .",
    "this corresponds to a convergence of the charge below 10@xmath35 electrons / atom . for beb@xmath0 , cab@xmath0 and srb@xmath0",
    "we have made the structural optimization with the similar procedure .      to calculate the electronic ground state properties of mgb@xmath6 , mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 and libc we used the tb - lmto method of andersen.@xcite the von barth - hedin parameterization",

    "we can therefore apply small strains to the equilibrium lattice , then determine the resulting change in the total energy , and from this information deduce the elastic constants .",
    "the elastic constants are identified as proportional to the second - order coefficient in a polynomial fit of the total energy as a function of the distortion parameter @xmath48.@xcite we determine linear combinations of the elastic constants by straining the lattice vectors @xmath49 according to the relation @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is a matrix containing the components of the distorted lattice vectors and @xmath52 the symmetric distortion matrix , which contains the strain components .",
    "we shall consider only small lattice distortions in order to remain within the elastic limit of the crystal . in the following",
    "we shall briefly list the relevant formulas used to obtain the elastic constants for hexagonal crystals .",
    "the internal energy of a crystal under strain , @xmath48 , can be taylor expanded in powers of the strain tensor with respect to the initial internal energy of the unstrained crystal in the following way , @xmath53 the volume of the unstrained system is denoted v@xmath54 , e(v@xmath54,0 ) being the corresponding total energy . in the equation above , @xmath55 is an element in the stress tensor .",
    "since we have five independent elastic constants , we need five different strains to determine them .",
    "the five distortions used in the present investigation are described below .",

    "hence , the hexagonal symmetry is preserved but volume is changed . the energy change associated with this strain can be written as @xmath67\\ ] ] the elastic constant @xmath68 can be directly obtained from the above relation . by solving the linear equations given above we have obtained all the five elastic constants . from pressure dependent lattice parameter measurements",
    "it is easy to obtain the bulk modulus along the crystallographic axes . also to quantify the mechanical anisotropy of mgb@xmath0",
    "it is important to calculate the bulk modulus along the axes . for hexagonal crystals the bulk modulus along @xmath24 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath70 )",
    "are defined as @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 the calculated bulk modulus along the crystallographic axes obtained from these relations are compared with the experimental results in sec.[sec : resdis ] .",
    "the calculated electronic band structure of mgb@xmath0 is given in fig.[fig : bnd1 ] .",
    "the interesting feature of this band structure is that a doubly degenerate , nearly flat , bands are present just above the @xmath2 in the @xmath75a direction in fig.[fig : bnd1 ] and cut the @xmath2 along the k@xmath76 direction .",
    "these bands give rise to nearly cylindrical , hole - like fermi surfaces around the @xmath3 point,@xcite indicating that the transport properties are dominated by the hole carriers in the plane where b atoms exist .",
    "these bands are incompletely filled bonding @xmath12 bands with predominantly boron @xmath13 character .",
    "the @xmath42 bands ( they are mainly in the unoccupied state and having finite contribution along m-@xmath3 direction at the vb in fig.[fig : bnd1 ] ) are derived from the intralayer @xmath77 bonding orbitals which also have interlayer couplings between adjacent atomic orbitals in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "our earlier study@xcite on superconducting la@xmath8x ( x = al , ga , in , tl ) compounds show that the presence of a flat band in the vicinity of @xmath2 gives large @xmath7 ( for la@xmath8 in addition of carbon gives a stable la@xmath8inc compound for which @xmath2 is brought to the pseudogap and results in a non - superconducting state . )",
    "the flat band feature is also present in the recently discovered superconducting yni@xmath0b@xmath0c compound . as a working hypothesis , we believe that this flat - band feature plays an important role for the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth to recall that the calculated@xcite electron - phonon interaction strength also shows a large value in the @xmath3-a direction where the flat - band feature is seen .",
    "moreover , zone boundary phonon calculations show that this band feature is very sensitive to the @xmath17 mode ( b - bond stretching ) .",
    "we observed that the top of this flat - band feature is around 0.54ev above @xmath2 .",
    "our calculations show that addition of around 0.32 electron to mgb@xmath78 will bring @xmath2 to the top of this energy band ( assuming rigid band filling ) .",
    "thus , if electrons are responsible for the superconductivity one can expect enhancement of @xmath1 on electron doping .",
    "et al._@xcite have reported the role of electron doping on the superconductivity in mg@xmath79al@xmath80b@xmath0 phase for which it is found that the @xmath7 drops smoothly up to @xmath81 = 0.1 and beyond @xmath81 = 0.25 the superconductivity is completely destroyed .",
    "this indicates that holes are responsible for the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 an observation consistent with hall effect measurements.@xcite the electron per atom ratio for tib@xmath0 is similar to that for mgb@xmath0 and hence it seems worthwhile to make comparison between these phases .",
    "the electronic structure of tib@xmath0@xcite shows that @xmath2 is located in a pseudogap on the dos curve and hence the estimated electron - phonon coupling constant is much smaller than for superconducting materials .",
    "this observation is consistent with the experimental findings in the sense that no superconductivity is detected for tib@xmath0 even below 1k.@xcite    the role of mg on the band structure of mgb@xmath0 can be elucidated by completely removing the mg atoms from the lattice and repeating the calculations for a hypothetical structure with only b atoms ( note : using the lattice parameters for mgb@xmath0 ) .",
    "the calculated electronic structure for b network alone is given in fig.[fig : bnd1 ] along with that of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the striking difference between the two cases is in the position of the flat band in the @xmath3-a direction .",
    "this flat band feature for the b network alone is strongly two dimensional ( viz . very little dispersion along @xmath3-a ) .",
    "this is ca .",
    "1.8ev above @xmath2 owing to the lower number of electrons in the b network compared with mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the b - b @xmath12 bonds are primarily responsible for the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly the bands are not deformed appreciably when we remove mg from mgb@xmath0 indicating that the electrons from mg atoms mainly give a shift in @xmath2 almost like rigid - band filling .",
    "this view point is confirmed also from the density of states study ( see fig.,[fig : pdos ] ) which shows that the topology of the dos profile with and without mg atoms in mgb@xmath0 are almost the same . but",
    "a shift in dos is observed when mg is removed from mgb@xmath0 .",
    "beb@xmath0 could be expected to have a high @xmath7 owing to the lighter be atoms which may provide larger phonon frequencies while maintaining a similar electronic structure to that of mgb@xmath0 . even though beb@xmath0 is isoelectronic with mgb@xmath0",
    ", the recent experimental study@xcite did not reveal any sign of superconductivity down to 5k .",
    "this negative finding makes it interesting to investigate the electronic structure of beb@xmath0 in detail .",
    "the lattice constants for beb@xmath0 obtained@xcite by averaging experimental data for the actual unit cell have been inferred to be @xmath24 = 2.94 and @xmath23 = 2.87  .",
    "there are no experimental lattice parameters available for beb@xmath0 with the alb@xmath0-type structure and hence we have made structural optimization using the fplapw method .",
    "table[table : bulk ] shows that @xmath24 is reduced only by about 1.6% , whereas @xmath23 is by about 8% when mg is replaced by be .",
    "the anisotropic changes of the lattice parameters can be understood from the anisotropic bonding situation in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "it looks as if the strong b ( @xmath82 ) @xmath12 bonds within the planes prevent more appreciable changes in @xmath24 whereas the weaker @xmath77 bonds along with the relatively weak ionic bonding between be and b bring about a larger change in the @xmath23 .",
    "consistent with the earlier calculation@xcite our calculated value of dos at @xmath2 for beb@xmath0 is smaller than that of mgb@xmath0 .",

    "the dos curves of beb@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 are indeed very similar as expected due to their isoelectronic and postulated isostructural nature .",
    "as mentioned above the dos features could lead one to a higher t@xmath16 for beb@xmath0 than for mgb@xmath0 ( the molecular weight of beb@xmath0 is lower than that of mgb@xmath0 ) .",
    "hirish predicted@xcite that the charge transfer from be to b in beb@xmath0 is less than that from mg to b in mgb@xmath0 and that @xmath2 is below the regime where superconductivity occurs .",
    "a closer inspection of the band structure ( see fig.[fig : bnd2 ] indicates that the key energy band , which we believe to be responsible for superconductivity , is broader in beb@xmath0 than in mgb@xmath0 and it is also located well above @xmath2 .",
    "hence the calculation suggests that even if one stabilizes beb@xmath0 in the alb@xmath0-type structure one can not expect superconductivity .",
    "our conclusion is consistent with the experimental observation in the sense that a recent study@xcite shows paramagnetic behavior down to 5k .",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that ca doping should lead to an overall increase in dos , and also provide an additional contribution to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we have therefore calculated dos ( using the optimized structural parameters ) for cab@xmath0 which shows ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) sharp features like those found in transition metal phases resulting from enhancement in volume compared with mgb@xmath0 .",
    "also , the calculated dos at @xmath2 is larger than that of mgb@xmath0 indicating a possibility for superconductivity .",
    "the larger volume compared with beb@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 along with the weak b - b interaction make the bulk modulus for this material become smaller .",

    "the flat band feature present in the k - m and @xmath3-a directions of the bz just below @xmath2 around @xmath190.23 ev ( see fig.[fig : bnd3 ] ) suggests that libc may be tuned to become superconducting upon hole doping .",
    "the calculated total dos ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) for mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 shows a finite number of electrons at @xmath2 ( which has the same number of valence electrons per non - metal atom as mgb@xmath0 ) and predicts metallic behavior .",

    "the most interesting aspect of fig.[fig : bnd3 ] is that there is flat band present in the vicinity of @xmath2 ( around the t@xmath19y direction ) similar to that in mgb@xmath0 and superconducting transition metal borocarbides ( e , g , yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , luni@xmath0b@xmath0c ) .",

    "earlier studies@xcite show that @xmath20-zrncl is a semiconductor with a band gap of @xmath103ev that upon li intercalation ( the electron donor element ) becomes superconducting with @xmath7 = 13k.@xcite this similarity is present for mgb@xmath0 also , that the electron donation from mg to b@xmath0 leads to superconductivity .",
    "ledbetter@xcite points out that the superconducting transition temperature in high @xmath7 cuprates increases with increasing debye temperature ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the high @xmath7 in mgb@xmath0 may be associated with the large @xmath86 in this material and this criterion would place mgb@xmath0 with high t@xmath16 cuprates .    in conventional superconductors , t@xmath16 increases with decreasing @xmath86 ,",
    "i.e. with lattice softening.@xcite the calculated @xmath86 for mgb@xmath0 from the elastic constants is 1016k which is found to be much higher value than in phonon mediated superconducting materials .",

    "therefore , experimental temperature dependent phonon spectra for mgb@xmath0 is required to establish whether softening of particular phonon modes is responsible for its large t@xmath16 .    the bcs theory and",

    "selected phonon modes may be strongly coupled to the electronic system and influence the magnitude of @xmath7 to a greater extent than average phonon modes . in consisitent with",
    "the above view point the lattice dynamical calculations@xcite reveal that the in - plane boron phonons near the zone - center are highly anharmanic with significant non - linear contribution to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "if such a situation occurs , the softening of certain phonons in combination with the light mass of the constituents may lower the phonon contribution ( @xmath94 ) and in turn enhance the electron - phonon coupling constant and hence @xmath7 .",

    "for example , the experimental electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements on tisi@xmath0 gave @xmath86 = 560 - 664k , whereas elastic constants measurements gave @xmath86 = 700k ( that is in close agreement with @xmath86 = 722k obtained from our theoretical elastic constant calculations@xcite ) .",
    "so , one can expect good agreement when comparing our @xmath86 with that obtained from elastic constants measurement .",
    "optical properties studies are of fundamental importance , since these involve not only the occupied and unoccupied parts of the electronic structure but also carries information on the character of the bands . in order to elucidate the anisotropy in the optical properties of mgb@xmath0 the calculated imaginary parts of dielectric tensor for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are shown in fig.[fig : optic ] . the important feature conveyed by the interband transition shown in fig.[fig : optic ] is that there is negligible contribution to @xmath135 in @xmath45 below 3.8ev .",
    "the interesting aspect for mgb@xmath0 is that even though the interband contribution to the optical spectra is highly anisotropic the calculated intraband contribution show nearly isotropic behavior .",
    "this originates from the close values of the calculated plasma frequencies ; 7.13 and 6.72ev for in - plane and perpendicular to the plane , respectively .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with @xmath136= 7.02ev and @xmath137= 6.68ev obtained by full - potential lmto calculation.@xcite .",
    "the intraband contribution to the optical dielectric tensor have been calculated similar to our earlier study.@xcite the calculated @xmath135 spectra which include both inter- and intraband contributions are shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig : optic ] . from these @xmath135 spectra one can derive all linear optical properties",
    ". unfortunately , there are no experimental spectra available for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the present study shows a common origin between the superconductivity in rare earth transition metal borocarbides and mgb@xmath0 that there is a flat band present in the vicinity of fermi level and also the b atoms are primarily involved in electron - phonon coupling in these materials .",
    "owing to the lack of single crystals the anisotropy in physical properties of mgb@xmath0 are not studied experimentally .",
    "we predicted large anisotropies in the optical and mechanical properties . from detailed electronic structure studies",
    "we have arrived at the following conclusions .",
    "the bonding behavior in mgb@xmath0 has been explained by analyses of site , angular momentum and orbital projected density of states as well as charge density and crystal overlap hamiltonian population .",
    "these analyses establish a mixed bonding behavior with ionic bonding between mg and b , covalent bonding between b atoms and metallic bonding between mg and mg like that in @xmath11 metals .",
    "we identified a large anisotropy in the mechanical properties of mgb@xmath0 from our calculated elastic constants , consistent with the anisotropy in the bonding behavior and high pressure neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "consequently , pressure can influence the bands in different directions of the bz in an unusually different manner and hence the physical properties .",
    "two degenerate flat bands have been identified near @xmath2 in the @xmath3-a direction of bz .",
    "these degenerate b @xmath13 bands are considered as the key in the realization of the high temperature superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the role of mg in mgb@xmath0 is to donate electrons to b atoms and hence to shift @xmath138 such that it lies very closer to the flat band , the feature which we believe important for superconductivity .",
    "we found similarity in the electronic structures of mgb@xmath0 libc and mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 .",
    "therefore superconductivity is expected in mgb@xmath0c@xmath0 and hole doped libc . on the other hand",
    "the electronic structure of beb@xmath0 , cab@xmath0 , srb@xmath0 and mgb@xmath6 suggest a low probability for superconductivity .",
    "+ 6 . because of the nearly flat bands in the vicinity of @xmath2 ( which will introduce temperature depending electronic screening of the phonon - mode frequencies ) , we expect temperature - dependent phonon - mode softening or large anisotropy in the phonon modes .",
    "the calculated boron nmr frequency is found to be in very good agreement with the experimental studies .",
    "as our calculated debye temperature for mgb@xmath0 is much larger than for other superconducting intermetallics , we believe that selected phonon modes can be strongly coupled to the electronic system and thus influence the magnitude of @xmath7 to a greater extent than the average phonon correlations may indicate .",
    "if the rigid band - filling approximation works and also the electrons are responsible for superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , our calculation suggests that a doping of 0.32 electrons will enhance @xmath7 .",
    "however , the experimental observation of reduction in @xmath7 by electron doping in mgb@xmath0 indicate that the holes are responsible for superconductivity .",
