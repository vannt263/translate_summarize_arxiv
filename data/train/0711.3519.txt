    "exciton @xcite is a bound pair between an electron and a hole in a crystal , which interact through coulomb attraction between them .",
    "when an electron from the valence band is excited into the conduction band , the missing electron in the valence band leaves a hole with opposite electric charge .",
    "the exciton results from the binding of the electron with its hole . as a result",
    "the exciton has slightly less energy than the unbound electron and hole .",
    "it has an important role to play in the fine structure of the absorption edge in semiconductor .",
    "it has been seen that as the photon energy goes above the band gap energy of the semiconductor , the absorption coefficient shows spikes due to the formation of exciton @xcite .",
    "this is an important study no doubt , because it explores the band structure and the character of the one electron states of the semiconductor .",
    "the properties of a semiconductor are mostly determined by the electronic states which lie just below and just above the forbidden gap .",
    "an appreciable amount of studies have been made to explore the band structure of semiconductors by examining direct and indirect optical absorption in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "this absorption may arise due to the transition between the states of the same side of the forbidden gap or across the forbidden gap .",
    "there have been a lot of studies in this field both theoretically and experimentally , see for example @xcite .",
    "since the constituents of exciton are electrically charged , the magnetic fields have certain effects on the energy spectra of the exciton and it in turn affects the fine structure of the absorption .",
    "the magnetic fields have a zeeman like effect on the energy spectra of an exciton , which has been investigated by studying optical absorption in many substances , for example , in @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "magneto - optic effect in strained and unstrained @xmath5 have been performed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a theoretical study of the effect of magnetic field on the absorption edge in solid has been done , neglecting the coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole .",
    "it is shown that a series of peaks may form due to the transition between the sub - bands , which originate due to the splitting of electron energy states in the solid by the magnetic field . instead of forming peaks , in some cases a series of steps",
    "are formed due to magnetic field .",
    "but coulomb interaction certainly has effect @xcite on the absorption in solids .",
    "it is therefore required to consider coulomb interaction and magnetic field simultaneously in the study of absorption @xcite . in general",
    "this problem is hard to tackle analytically for any magnetic field .",
    "but for large magnetic field an approximation scheme @xcite can be used to handle the situation and can be checked experimentally for some substances like @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc . according to this approximation scheme , which is valid in large magnetic field",
    ", the coulomb term should only affect the dynamics of the exciton in the direction of the applied magnetic field and it is therefore possible to reduce the time independent three dimensional schrdinger equation into one dimensional eigenvalue equation in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb interaction shows that the the absorption peaks in each magnetic sub - band transition is moved towards the lowest exciton line .",
    "the other effects are the reduction of intensity of the continuous absorption and to smooth out the peaks near the absorption edge .",
    "the peaks are the exciton peaks instead of the magneto - optic peaks .",
    "it is expected that the analytical theory of absorption in solids @xcite will not be able to exactly explore the true nature of the band structure due to the approximation used in the calculation . in this article",
    ", we therefore try to incorporate some short range interactions into the boundary condition , imposed on the domain of the system so that the results based on the approximate model agrees with the experiments as much as possible .",
    "this nontrivial boundary condition will in general change the energy spectrum of the system and it will depend on a parameter , called self - adjoint extension parameter .",
    "the fine structure of the optical absorption edge in a crystal due to exciton essentially depends on the energy spectrum of the exciton .",
    "it is therefore expected to change if the spectrum changes . to get a consistent boundary condition and the domain , so that the hamiltonian remains self - adjoint ,",
    "we perform a self - adjoint extension ( sae ) of the one dimensional hamiltonian in the direction of the magnetic field by using von neumann s method @xcite .",
    "self - adjointness of a hamiltonian is essential , because otherwise the hamiltonian would generate complex eigenvalues and the time evolution of the states will not be unitary .",
    "sae has received lot of interests in recent years and is now being used extensively in different branches of physics , to explore the nontrivial quantum behavior of different systems @xcite .",
    "the present article has been organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss about the exciton in a magnetic field background and write an effective radial eigenvalue equation following @xcite , which we need to quantize using nontrivial boundary condition .",
    "the method of self - adjoint extensions ( sae ) is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , which is essential to get nontrivial boundary condition for the effective hamiltonian @xmath7 so that the hamiltonian is self - adjoint .",
    "the bound state and scattering state solutions are discussed in sec .",
    "iv and v respectively .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion in sec vi .",
    "we consider dynamics of electron and hole pair with effective masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath10 . in a magnetic field background",
    "@xmath11 the time independent schrdinger equation for the system is given by @xcite @xmath12\\psi= e\\psi\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are magnetic vector potentials at electron and hole positions respectively .",
    "considering the fact that the states of interest in optical transitions are only those in which @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are electron and hole wave vectors respectively ) , lamb @xcite simplified the above equation by changing the variables to the center of mass coordinate @xmath18 and relative position @xmath19 and using the substitution @xmath20 $ ]    @xmath21u(\\boldsymbol{r})= eu(\\boldsymbol{r})\\,,\\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the reduced mass @xmath23 of the electron - hole system .",
    "the presence of coulomb interaction spoils the separability of ( [ ham ] ) in any co - ordinates .",
    "so it is difficult to solve the equation in any coordinate system .",
    "it can however be reduced in an one dimensional eigenvalue equation in large magnetic field limit .",
    "note that the magnetic field affects the motion of a charged particle in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . in our case",
    "we take the magnetic field in @xmath24 direction .",
    "so , in @xmath24 direction the charged particle motion will be a free particle motion in absence of coulomb force .",
    "but in presence of coulomb force the free motion in @xmath24 direction will be modified according to ref . @xcite .",
    "the potential along @xmath24 direction will now be the average coulomb potential over the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane at each point in @xmath24 axis @xcite . from now on , we take @xmath25 , for the simplicity of calculations . in these units ,",
    "the one dimensional differential equation is of the form @xcite @xmath26\\chi(|z|)\\\\ & = & e_{|z|}\\chi(|z|)\\ , , \\label{1dhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constant parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) and its values will depend on the eigenfunctions on the perpendicular @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "we thus lead to a one dimensional differential eigenvalue problem which depends on the modulus of cartesian co - ordinate @xmath24 due to the reflection symmetry on the @xmath24 axis .",
    "the inner product is now defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the measure . in order to find the bound state eigenvalue and corresponding eigenfunction of ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] )",
    ", we need to consider a physically meaningful boundary condition .",
    "we want to find out this boundary condition by von neumann s method of self - adjoint extension ( sae ) .",
    "before going into the actual hamiltonian @xmath7 of ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) , it is essential to discuss about the general properties and method of self - adjoint extensions of an operator @xmath31 defined over the elements of a hilbert space @xmath32",
    ". let us consider @xmath33 as the domain of @xmath31 such that the operator @xmath31 becomes symmetric in that domain .",
    "the operator @xmath31 is said to be symmetric ( or hermitian ) if it satisfies the condition @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the inner product defined over the hilbert space . given the operator @xmath31 and the inner product @xmath36 , one can calculate the adjoint operator @xmath37 from the green s formula @xcite .",
    "this adjoint operator @xmath37 should have a domain @xmath38 , which can be obtained from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "now , if the operator is self - adjoint then @xmath42 and for non self - adjoint case @xmath43 . for non self - adjoint operators we need to find out self - adjoint extensions , because according to stone s theorem @xcite self - adjointness of an operator is necessary in order to guarantee unitary evolution .",
    "we follow von neumann s method for finding self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian , if there is any .",
    "according to this method , we first need to find out the solutions of the equation @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 are called deficiency space solutions , because the numbers @xmath46 are a measure by which a non self - adjoint operator is away from self - adjointness , where @xmath46 denotes the number of @xmath45 solutions . for @xmath47 , the operator @xmath37 is self - adjoint . for @xmath48 , the operator",
    "@xmath37 is not self - adjoint , but admits self - adjoint extensions characterized by @xmath49 parameters of @xmath50 .",
    "finally , for @xmath51 , the operator @xmath37 is not self - adjoint and ca nt be made self - adjoint .",
    "the self - adjoint extension of the operator @xmath37 is given by the domain @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "as a function of the parameter @xmath54 . this type of plot is previously obtained in ref .",
    "this discussion and the properties of the function can be found in @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we now come to the discussion of the hamiltonian ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) , for which we seek a self - adjoint domain .",
    "we construct an initial domain @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are absolutely continuous and @xmath58 .",
    "it is implied that @xmath56 and @xmath59 are square - integrable functions , i.e. , belong to the hilbert space .",
    "note that @xmath60 is so restricted that the hamiltonian @xmath7 becomes symmetric in this domain .",
    "the adjoint hamiltonian @xmath61 has the same differential form ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) , but the domain is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are absolutely continuous .",
    "the two domains are seen to be different , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "so we need to find out the deficiency space solutions ( square integrable ) , which are in our case the solutions of the differential equations @xmath64 .",
    "these are @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the whittaker s function @xcite .",
    "the square integrability of ( [ def ] ) can be easily checked from the asymptotic and short distance behavior .",
    "note however that the potential at @xmath69 is always finite so there is no problem of short distance square - integrability but the short distance behavior will help to get the spectrum for the problem .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is given by @xmath70 which goes to zero asymptotically , i.e. , @xmath71 . in order to get short distance behavior",
    "we need to express the whittaker s function in terms of kummer function as @xmath72\\ , , \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the kummer function @xcite .",
    "the short distance behavior can now be evaluated as @xmath74\\,,\\label{sdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    since in our case @xmath77 ,",
    "@xmath7 is not self - adjoint but it admits self - adjoint extensions , characterized by a parameter @xmath2 and the domain over which the hamiltonian @xmath78 is self - adjoint is given by @xmath79 where @xmath55 .",
    "now we can solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) and find out eigenvalue using the extended domain ( [ sdomain ] ) .",
    "the eigenfunction of ( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) apart from normalization is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 has already been defined .",
    "the eigenvalue of ( [ eigenfunction ] ) can be found by looking at the short distance behavior of ( [ sdomain ] ) and ( [ eigenfunction ] ) and equating the coefficients of equal powers of @xmath83 . for general value of the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath2 ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation is found to be @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigenvalue ] ) is a 1-parameter family of equation .",
    "it is to be noted that the equation of the form ( [ eigenvalue ] ) is discussed in detail in ref . @xcite and",
    "the reason we get similar equation here is that the nature of the boundary condition obtained from the short distance behavior of the special functions are similar in both cases .",
    "each value of the parameter @xmath2 correspond to a different quantization for the system .",
    "a plot of @xmath87 as a function of @xmath54 can be found in fig .",
    "1 . the intersection of the horizontal line with the curves between consecutive vertical lines gives the value of alpha , in other words value of the energy @xmath88 .",
    "it is in general hard to solve ( [ eigenvalue ] ) analytically .",
    "but in certain limits it can be evaluated exactly .",
    "for example , when the r.h.s of ( [ eigenvalue ] ) is zero , the eigenvalue is @xmath89 where @xmath90 . when the r.h.s is infinity , the eigenvalue @xmath88 becomes @xmath91 in between zero and infinity the eigenvalue can be obtained from fig .",
    "1 . let us now consider the infinite magnetic field limit , @xmath92 . in this limit @xmath93 and from ( [ eigen1 ] )",
    "we get @xmath94 note that for @xmath92 , we get the same energy eigenvalue ( [ eigen3 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eigen2 ] ) , but this time @xmath95 .",
    "we now move to the discussion of scattering state solutions",
    ". the eigenvalue equation for scattering states will be the same eq .",
    "( [ 1dhamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath88 is now positive .",
    "the scattering state solution is of the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are undetermined coefficients .",
    "one can now determine the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 by looking at the short distance behavior of ( [ sdomain ] ) and ( [ scattering_state ] ) and equating the same powers of @xmath83 , which will now depend upon the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath2 .",
    "note that the scattering state solution ( [ scattering_state ] ) does not belong to the domain ( [ sdomain ] ) for the simple reason that the scattering state solutions are not normalizable and thus does not belong to the hilbert space .",
    "but there is no problem for the scattering states to be square integrable at short distance and thus it may belong to the domain ( [ sdomain ] ) as far as the short distance behavior is concerned ( see @xcite for detail discussion with an example ) it is also possible to calculate the @xmath102-matrix and phase shift from this scattering state solution .",
    "the knowledge of quantum mechanical behavior of exciton in a magnetic field background is essential for the study of absorption in semiconductors as has been shown in ref .",
    "since the time independent schrdinger equation for the exciton can not be exactly solved , an approximation scheme is generally used @xcite in order to solve the system analytically . in order to overcome the shortcomings of the approximation scheme and to guarantee unitary evolution of the system we obtain a 1-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of the effective one dimensional eigenvalue equation .",
    "we obtain bound state and scattering state solutions , which in general depend on the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the direct optical absorption coefficients @xmath3 depend upon the bound and scattering state solutions which are dependent on the boundary conditions characterized by the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath2 can be used to fine tune the optical absorption coefficient @xmath3 to match with the experimental data .",
