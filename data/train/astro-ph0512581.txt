    "figure  [ f2.eps]_b _ also shows an edge - on view , exhibiting a polarization pattern different from figure  [ f2.eps]_a_ ; the polarization vector is oriented along the projected disk surface because the radial component of the magnetic field in the hourglass structure contributes @xmath45 there . in @xmath58",
    "au , the polarization vector is still perpendicular to the disk , similar to figure  [ f2.eps]_a_. figure  [ f2.eps]_c _ shows the change in the direction of the mean magnetic field ; the outflow , whose direction is indicated by the thick line , is aligned with the central polarization vector .",
    "magnetic field strength can be estimated from the polarization maps of figure  [ f1.eps ] using the method of @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the mean density , estimated by averaging the surface density over the map , @xmath61 denotes the rms gas velocity , assumed as the velocity component parallel to the line of sight superposed as @xmath62 , and @xmath63 denotes the standard deviation to the mean orientation angle of the polarization vector .",

    "the prediction of the chandrasekhar - fermi formula should be corrected by a factor of @xmath66 for model mf45 and @xmath67 for model wf45 , as shown in table  [ table : pol ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also report such an overestimated field strength in application of the chandrasekhar - fermi formula , and obtain a correction factor of @xmath68 , which is consistent with our case .",
    "@xcite discuss the deviation from the prediction of the chandrasekhar - fermi formula as being attributable to deviation from the linear theory , which is assumed by @xcite .",
    "the large values of @xmath63 shown in table  [ table : pol ] indicate that the alfvn wave is nonlinear with large amplitude in our models .",
    "moreover , it is noteworthy that model wf45 exhibits larger @xmath63 than model mf45 , indicating that the correction is more significant for a cloud with weaker magnetic field .",
    "activity of an outflow may be discussed in terms of alignment of the outflow with the magnetic field .",
    "the cloud core with stronger magnetic field exhibits a faster outflow as shown in figure 18 of mt04 , and the outflow tends to be aligned with the polarization vector .",
    "this indicates that the fast outflow is observed parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "according to the observations toward cttss , @xcite suggest a similar tendency in spite of the different evolutionary stage from that considered here : cttss without bright and extended outflows have a tendency to be perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the outflows are extended up to only @xmath69  au in the mhd simulation data used here , while the outflows observed by molecular line emission are extended up to a 1000  au scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , the outflows presented here have considerably slower velocity than that observed around young stars .",
    "therefore the cloud cores presented here are restricted to the very early evolutionary stage compared with the observed cloud cores .",
    "this restriction arises in response to computational cost for solving the launch mechanism of the outflow near the protostar . in further stages",
    ", the magnetic field hardly seems to affect the direction of the outflow on the scale of 1000  au , because the outflow is accelerated at @xmath70  au at a speed comparable to the alfvn velocity at this radius , and the magnetic field strength of the envelope decreases rapidly , proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the protostar may be decoupled from the magnetic field of the envelope as a result of efficient ambipolar diffusion @xcite in further stages .",
    "the directions of the outflow will be fixed during the main accretion phase of the protostar .",
