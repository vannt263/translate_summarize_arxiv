    "ab dorads is a k0 dwarf , originally discovered as a bright x - ray source by and subsequently observed by rosat @xcite and _",
    "beppo_sax @xcite .",
    "its photometric variability is believed to be due to starspots ( , ) and this , combined with its brightness ( @xmath0 ) and rapid rotation ( p=0514 ) have made it an attractive candidate for doppler imaging ( , , , , , , ) . from observations of the lithium line at 6708 , suggested it was a post - t tauri star . according to hipparcos data it is 14.94@xmath10.12 pc away .",
    "inferred an age of @xmath22 - 3x10@xmath3 year and its common - proper - motion companion , the m dwarf rst 137b .",
    "ab dor is of interest for a variety of reasons .",
    "the most important , for the purposes of this paper , is that zeeman doppler images have been obtained in 3 consecutive years : 1995 dec 7 - 13@xcite ; 1996 dec 23 - 29@xcite ; and 1998 jan 10 - 15 .",
    "these studies reveal that the radial field has at least 12 regions of opposite polarities at intermediate to high latitude , which are approximately regularly spaced in longitude together with a unidirectional ring of azimuthal field at 70 - 80indicating an underlying large - scale toroidal field @xcite .    ab dor exhibits flaring x - ray emission ( , ) and there is indirect evidence from radio observations at 3,6,13 and 20 cm that the radio emission is highly directive and suggests synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the star is surrounded by a system of circumstellar prominences which can be observed as absorption transients in optically thick low - excitation lines e.g.  h balmer , caii and mgii when the prominences cross the line of sight ( , , ) .",
    "these prominences are trapped by the stellar magnetic field at , or beyond , the point of centrifugal balance .",
    "their presence demonstrates that the corona is highly structured even as far out as 3 - 5@xmath4 @xcite .    despite the rapid rotation",
    ", the differential rotation has been measured by cross - correlation of zeeman doppler images secured a few days apart to be close to solar , with the equator lapping the poles in @xmath2110@xmath5 ( _ cf . _",
    "120@xmath5 in the solar case ) @xcite . on longer timescales ,",
    "however , have shown that the spot distribution of the similar young rapid rotator he 699 becomes uncorrelated after 30 days .",
    "the purpose this paper is to investigate the effect of diffusion and differential rotation on the evolution of ab dorads s magnetic field .",
    "we aim to find out whether shearing at the edge of a unipolar cap can produce the observed ring of unidirectional azimuthal field .",
    "we also seek to determine the lifetimes of surface magnetic features subject to diffusion and differential rotation .",
    "we are using a code originally developed by to study the formation of filament channels on the sun .",
    "it can also be used to study the field of ab dorads because we have high - resolution magnetic maps ( 29 at the equator ) and the differential rotation is similar to the solar value .",
    "the code takes the observed surface radial component of the field and calculates a potential field from this , and then evolves the calculated magnetic field due to the effects of differential rotation and diffusion .",
    "have demonstrated that for latitudes below about 60the field is well - represented by a potential approximation .",
    "we anticipate that departures from a potential field caused by the shearing effect of the differential rotation will appear at high latitudes near the edge of the unipolar cap . by fitting the stokes v profiles with both potential @xcite and non - potential @xcite field models , it is possible to show that any currents are concentrated close to the pole .      if we assume that the field is potential , then we can write * b * in terms of a flux function @xmath6 , with @xmath7 which in spherical co - ordinates gives @xmath8    @xmath9 and @xmath10 here @xmath6 satisfies laplace s equation @xmath11 which can be expressed as @xmath12 a separable solution for @xmath6 can be found @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the associated legendre functions and @xmath15 we chose to truncate the series at @xmath16 , corresponding to the maximum resolution of the reconstructed field images .",
    "we clearly need two boundary conditions to determine @xmath6 .",
    "we chose to specify as one boundary condition that at some distance from the star ( the _ source surface _ , @xmath17 ) , the field is radial and so @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this mimics the stellar wind .    since most stellar prominences form at around the corotation radius ( 2.7@xmath4 )",
    ", we know that a significant fraction of the field is closed at that radius . hence we choose @xmath19 .",
    "we then have @xmath20 equivalent to @xmath21 as a second boundary condition we impose the radial field at the surface to be the observed radial field .",
    "we can then express the magnetic field in terms of the two - dimensional fourier coefficients @xmath22 , where @xmath23 so @xmath24 the function @xmath25 is derived from a fast fourier transform performed latitude - by - latitude on the observed radial field @xmath26 .",
    "once the field is evolved due to diffusion and differential rotation , it is not necessarily potential , although it can still be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics .",
    "the field components are then expressed in terms of the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29\\ ] ] is the radial component of the current and @xmath30\\ ] ] is the 2-dimensional divergence .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      for comparison , we can look at the field evolution over a much shorter period of time .",
    "this has the advantage that we can compare our results with the observed evolution of the field during a single observing run .",
    "here we use data from the 1996 run , in which we secured two sets of magnetic maps , separated by 5 nights ( fig .",
    "[ field96 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to determine whether the observed magnetic elements retain their identities over a period of 5 nights in the presence of diffusion and differential rotation .",
    "we began by investigating the effect of varying the diffusivity .",
    "we evolved the 1996 dec 23/25 field forward in time using various values of the diffusion coefficient . in each case",
    "we cross - correlated the resulting radial field map with the observed radial field for dec 29 ( fig [ compare ] ) .",
    "we ensured that the cross - correlation only involved those longitudes that were well - observed , _ viz . _ 18 - 180@xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation function was computed for each of a set of latitudes between 0 and 80 in the visible hemisphere , and the amplitude of the strongest peak in the ccf at each latitude is plotted in fig .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "it can be seen that the five - day span of these observations is too short for differences in the value chosen for diffusivity to have much effect .",
    "we also considered the case where the field was allowed to evolve under the influence of diffusion only , i.e. with the differential rotation switched off .",
    "we found that over the 5-day span of the 1996 december observations , the influence of the differential rotation was negligible ( fig .",
    "[ nocompare ] ) .    from these",
    "we see that altering the value of the diffusion and removing the differential rotation have little effect on the cross - correlation over 5 nights .",
    "we would need observations over a longer timescale , say a month , to be able to look for meaningful results .",
    "demonstrated that the high - latitude azimuthal band of field was not reproduced by modelling the field as potential . here",
    "we investigate whether the differential rotation could produce this band by taking the 1998 radial field map and adding in a cap of unipolar radial field extending from the pole to latitude 80 , well within the dark polar spot seen in the stellar surface - brightness map .",
    "an identical cap of opposite polarity was added to the unobservable hemisphere to conserve flux .",
    "we emphasize that the polarity and strength of the dark polar cap can not be determined directly from the observations , since the low surface brightness and strong foreshortening suppress the zeeman signal from this part of the star .",
    "for each of a range of plausible polar field strengths and polarities we evolved the field forward in time for 5 days , then compared the mean value of @xmath31 at each latitude with the observed value .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ negcap98 ] that a high - latitude azimuthal band of negative polarity is produced when we shear the image at the observed differential rotation rate with a polar cap having @xmath32 and vice versa .",
    "the results confirm that the observed differential rotation is capable of producing a high - latitude negative azimuthal band , as is seen in the observations from all three observing seasons ( fig .",
    "[ torcompare ] ) .",
    "this predicts that the magnetic polarity of the dark polar region was predominantly negative in all three seasons .",
    "the latitude of the maximum in @xmath31 occurs at the edge of the imposed unipolar cap in fig .",
    "[ negcap98 ] .",
    "the azimuthal field is localised here because most field lines originating in the north polar cap are connected to high northern latitudes just outside the cap .",
    "the direction of these field lines depends strongly upon the distribution of radial field at mid to high latitudes . changing the strength of the polar cap has little effect on field lines at low latitude",
    "this corresponds to our result that @xmath33 varies little at low latitude as the strength of the cap is altered ( as seen in fig [ negcap98 ] ) .",
    "the observed azimuthal band plotted in fig .",
    "[ torcompare ] is more diffuse than the model , having a broader peak between latitudes 65and 80 in all three seasons data .",
    "this corresponds roughly to the edge of the dark polar region , which extends to latitude 70or so .",
    "the breadth of the peak suggests a more gradual fall - off in the polar field than we imposed on the model . the apparent decrease in field strength at latitudes above 70can",
    "probably be ascribed to suppression of the zeeman signal within the dark polar region .",
    "the strength of the azimuthal field after only 5 nights is substantially less than that observed .",
    "this is not surprising , since the timescale on which shear can generate an azimuthal field with a strength comparable to the radial and meridional field will be of order the equator - pole lap time of 110 days .",
    "the diffusion time for length scales comparable to the size of the individual magnetic regions in the images is also of this order .",
    "once an equilibrium is established between diffusion and differential rotation , we would expect the azimuthal field strength to be an order of magnitude greater than that produced after 5 days , in agreement with the observations . on a 100-day timescale",
    ", however , we expect the picture to be complicated further by the emergence of new flux , making a direct comparison with the observations problematic .",
    "we have modelled the evolution of the magnetic field of ab dorads due to the effects of differential rotation and diffusion .",
    "we use as a starting point the zeeman doppler images obtained on three consecutive years and assume that the field is initially potential , but evolves away from this state as a function of time",
    ".    over a timescale of 20 to 30 days we have determined , as a function of time , the cross - correlation of our model radial magnetic field with the observed radial component on the first night .",
    "we find that over one month , the cross - correlation function decays by about 10% .",
    "observations of he699 by show however that cross - correlating the observed spot distributions over this timescale gives much more rapid decrease of the cross - correlation function .",
    "this result suggests that the evolution of ab dorads s surface magnetic field is not governed solely by diffusion and differential rotation .",
    "we conclude that these results are more likely to be due to the effects of flux emergence changing the spot distribution than the effects of diffusion or differential rotation .",
    "this result is independent of the assumed degree of field diffusion .",
    "we have compared the effects of values of @xmath34 ranging from 250 to 450 km@xmath35s@xmath36 and found the results to be qualitatively the same .",
    "the presence of some diffusion is of course necessary ( and we have confirmed that the magnetic energy grows monotonically with time in the absence of diffusion ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath34 seems however to have little effect on the five - day timescale of a typical observing run .",
    "since diffusion has little effect on the flux distribution , the differential rotation acts simply to advect the field .",
    "consequently , although at each latitude the peak of the cross - correlation function may be at a different longitude @xcite , its actual value is virtually unchanged by the effects of differential rotation .",
    "we have also compared the radial and azimuthal magnetic fields generated by our model over 5 nights with those obtained from zeeman doppler images on 1996 dec 23/25 and 29 , and found the agreement to be excellent .",
    "the evolution of the azimuthal field is of particular interest with regard to the band of high latitude unidirectional azimuthal field seen in the zeeman - doppler images .",
    "we have investigated whether the shearing effect of the differential rotation is sufficient to generate this band of field .",
    "the polarity of this band depends upon the sign of the radial field in the polar cap , whereas its strength depends on the competition between shear and diffusion .",
    "since the diffusion timescale for resolvable features is comparable to the winding time , we expect the azimuthal field to attain a strength comparable to the radial and meridional field near the boundary of the polar cap , as is indeed observed .",
    "our results suggest that the differential rotation could play a major part in the creation and preservation of a high latitude azimuthal band .",
