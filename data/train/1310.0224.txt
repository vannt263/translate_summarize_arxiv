    "the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) is a multi - wavelength survey designed to search for both x - ray sources and their optical counterparts in the direction towards and in the milky way bulge .",
    "the gbs covers a pair of @xmath8 areas centered @xmath9 above and below the galactic plane .",
    "these regions are chosen to avoid the high optical extinction and crowding found in the mid - plane .",
    "the full survey area has been observed in x - rays with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory to a 0.5 - 10 kev flux upper limit of @xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 .",
    "the gbs area has been also imaged in optical bands with the ctio 4-m blanco telescope to typical upper limits of @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "a total of 1640 unique x - ray sources have been found ( jonker et al .",
    "2011 ; jonker et al .  in prep .",
    ") , providing a large sample to fulfill the two main goals of this project . in what follows we briefly describe these goals , while the specific details concerning the gbs can be found in jonker et al .",
    "the first gbs goal involves measuring masses of neutron stars and black holes in eclipsing x - ray binaries in order to constrain the neutron star equation of state and black hole formation models .",
    "this requires us to identify new x - ray binaries with optical counterparts suitable for dynamical studies .",
    "these studies will allow one to measure the masses of compact objects , with unprecedented accuracy in the case of eclipsing systems . to facilitate achieving this objective , the limiting sensitivity for the x - ray imaging",
    "was selected to maximize the number of detected quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) with respect to new cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the expectation is to detect in x - rays more than 200 qlmxbs with 120 of them having detectable counterparts in the gbs optical images . in comparison , the current number of known lmxbs in the galaxy exceeds 170 ( see e.g.  zel et al .",
    "2010 ) . more than half of them are persistently x - ray bright , making them usually unsuitable for dynamical studies due to the lack of spectral features from the donor star in their optical spectra . in contrast , the photosphere from the donor star is expected to contribute significantly to the optical spectra of qlmxbs . nowadays",
    "the census of lmxbs grows each year by a few with the discovery of transient lmxbs during unpredictable x - ray outbursts .",
    "once in quiescence , optical counterparts are detected for sources not affected by severe reddening and/or crowding issues .",
    "the gbs instead represents a systematic effort to identify a large sample of new qlmxbs with optical counterparts suitable for further follow - up .",
    "a sample consisting of systems that have not undergone a recent outburst will allow us to establish if there exist selection effects that arise from the current sample of persistent objects and transients that have suffered outbursts in the past few decades .",
    "the second gbs objective is to investigate binary formation and evolution scenarios , including the study of kicks during the supernova event that produces the compact primary in an lmxb .",
    "the method employed to achieve this goal involves comparing the observed number of sources per source class with the number of sources predicted by binary population synthesis calculations .",
    "the calculations presented in jonker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predicted a total of 1648 x - ray sources in the gbs area .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the 1640 sources detected in x - rays . to allow detailed comparisons , multiwavelength and variability studies are in progress to identify and characterize counterparts to the gbs sources .",

    "2012a , maccarone et al .",
    "2012a , rojas et al . 2012 )    in order to identify the optical counterparts we are acquiring spectra for the candidate counterparts found within the error circle for the precise _ chandra _ x - ray position .",
    "large aperture telescopes are being used to target qlmxbs which are expected to be faint as they suffer from reddenening and are located at kiloparsec distances .",
    "for instance the unreddened apparent magnitude and colours of a ( donor ) star at a distance of 8 kpc are @xmath14 for f0 dwarfs and @xmath15 for m2 dwarfs .",
    "taking into account reddening the predicted apparent magnitudes for active lmxbs in the gbs area is @xmath16 , while qlmxbs are expected to have @xmath17 ( jonker et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on twenty - three gbs objects that we have selected as new accreting binaries on the basis of our results obtained from spectroscopy with the vlt and magellan telescopes .",
    "we begin by describing in section 2 the spectroscopic and photometric observations . in section 3",
    "we explain how the data were processed . in section 4",
    "we present and discuss the results for the twenty - three sources .",
    "accurate coordinates , finding charts , optical light curves from the blanco 4 m telescope and spectra of medium resolution ( @xmath18  ) and relatively large wavelength coverage are provided for each object .",
    "finally , in section 5 we consider how to overcome the selection bias toward emission line objects that single epoch spectroscopic surveys will suffer from . in this paper",
    "we will follow the designation to the sources introduced in jonker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : cx @xmath19 where @xmath19 is the source number in the count rate sorted gbs catalogue .",
    "vimos ( le fvre et al . , 2003 ) is a 4-channel imager and multi - object spectrograph mounted on the nasmyth focus of the 8.2-m eso unit 3 very large telescope at paranal , chile .",
    "each channel ( a.k.a .",
    "quadrant ) covers a field of view of about @xmath20 arcmin@xmath21 .",
    "the four quadrants are separated by approximately 2 arcmin wide gaps .",
    "the current vimos detectors are @xmath22 pixels eev ccds that provide a 0.205 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "prior to august 2011 vimos was equipped with eev ccds of same format as the new detector , but with both lower sensitivity and strong fringing in the red .",
    "the gbs sources cx73 and cx772 were observed using the old ccds .    during the observations vimos",
    "was operated in multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode . in this mode",
    "laser - cut slit masks are inserted at the entrance focal plane permitting spectroscopy of optical counterpart candidates to several gbs sources in a single exposure .",
    "the slit masks are prepared using the vimos mask preparation software ( vmmps ) tool ( see bottini et al .",
    "vmmps uses pre - images of the fields as reference frames to define the slit and secure objects well - centered at the slit positions after telescope acquisition of the field .",
    "all slits were designed with a 1.0 arcsec width .",
    "their length and location were determined per gbs source to include more than one optical counterpart candidates if possible , to secure areas for sky subtraction during the data reduction and/or to avoid strong saturation of bright sources .",
    "thus the identified counterparts were not necessarily centered on their slits .",
    "we selected the medium resolution ( mr ) grism that yields a 2.5  / pixel dispersion and a wavelength coverage of @xmath23  .",
    "the exact coverage depends on the location of the small slit with respect to the ccd boundaries as some part of the dispersed spectrum may fall off the chip .",
    "the gg475 order - sorting filter was used to avoid overlap between the first and second grating orders when observing bright sources .",
    "the use of 1.0 arcsec width slits provided a spectral resolution of about 10   fwhm corresponding to 460 km s@xmath7 at h@xmath4 and 350 km s@xmath7 at 8600  .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained in service mode under programs 085.d-0441(a ) and 087.d-0596(a ) .",
    "one hour observing blocks ( obs ) were executed per pointing , consisting of acquisition imaging , two spectroscopic integrations of 875 s , three flat - field exposures and a helium - argon lamp exposure for wavelength calibration .",
    "the standard data reduction steps were performed with the eso - vimos pipeline ( izzo et al .",
    "these include bias subtraction , bad - pixel correction , wavelength calibration and removal of the instrumental response .",
    "the typical root mean square ( rms ) for the wavelength calibration fit was @xmath24 pixels .",
    "the pipeline averages the two spectra and extracts automatically the objects found in each slit .",
    "the pipeline data products were examined to identify any problems with the extraction of the spectra .",
    "this examination showed that the output spectra for isolated objects were satisfactory in terms of extraction quality .",
    "this was not the case for partially resolved sources where the choice of the aperture size for the object , sky subtraction regions and tracing become critical steps during the extraction process .",
    "thus we extracted interactively with the iraf kpnoslit package all reduced 2-d frames that contain both stellar and sky spectra ( pipeline files with product code ssem ) .",
    "for partially resolved sources in crowded fields , the object and sky apertures were sized to maximize the number of pixels contributing to the object and sky , respectively , and to minimize the contribution from any field star / s .",
    "checks for the stability of the wavelength calibration were made for each object looking at the strongest atmospheric emission lines present in the spectra .",
    "we made use of the [ oi ] @xmath25 line and/or the oh emission at @xmath26    ( osterbrock et al .",
    "1996,1997 ) .",
    "in this way we estimate that the median amplitude of the radial velocity error is @xmath27 km s@xmath7 .",
    "zero point corrections were applied only to the spectra of the sources cx70 and cx377 which showed radial velocity offsets in the [ oi ] and oh emission lines wavelengths well above the distribution of the internal radial velocity error .    in a few cases the observing conditions were not good during the ob execution and the ob",
    "was repeated later under the weather conditions requested for the program .",
    "spectra of an optical counterpart extracted from different obs were combined if they were acquired close in time and if there were no significant changes in the spectra between observations .",
    "a log of the vimos observations is presented in table 1 in which identification numbers for the gbs sources , pre - imaging obs and spectroscopic obs are given . the observing date and the quadrant where the object was detected",
    "are also provided .",
    "the gbs sources cx44 and cx1011 were observed with imacs ( bigelow & dressler 2003 ) which is mounted on the 6.5-m baade - magellan telescope at las campanas observatory . both objects were observed on the night of 15 may 2011 ut with imacs operated in short - camera mode . in this mode the spectra are dispersed along the long axis of two of the eight @xmath28 pixels e2v ccds with 0.20 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "we used a 300 line mm@xmath7 grism centered at 6700    yielding a dispersion of 1.15    pixel@xmath7 ( ccd no .",
    "3 ) and 1.31    pixel@xmath7 ( ccd no .",
    "8) in the spectral intervals @xmath29 and @xmath30  , respectively .",
    "together with a 1.0 arcsec wide slit , the instrumental setup achieved a spectral resolution of @xmath31    fwhm corresponding to 230 km s@xmath7 at h@xmath4 and 175 km s@xmath7 at 8600  .",
    "a single spectrum was acquired per source with an integration time of 1200 and 900 s for cx44 and cx1011 , respectively .",
    "the flux standards feige 56 , feige 57 and ltt 3864 were also observed in order to correct for the instrumental response .",
    "the imacs frames were bias and flat - field corrected with standard iraf routines .",
    "the spectra were extracted from each ccd frame with the iraf kpnoslit package .",
    "the pixel - to - wavelength calibration was derived from cubic spline fits to henear arc lines .",
    "the rms deviation of the fit was @xmath32  .",
    "the sky [ oi ] @xmath25 line and the oh emission blend at 7316.3   show that the accuracy of the wavelength calibration of the spectra from both ccds is @xmath33   .",
    "we acquired time - resolved photometry from 12 to 18 july 2010 with the mosaic - ii instrument mounted on the blanco 4-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "multiple 120s exposures of 45 overlapping fields were taken to cover a nine square degree area in the sloan @xmath34-band containing the gbs x - ray sources reported in jonker et al .",
    "the order in which the fields were visited was randomized to minimize aliasing caused by regular sampling .",
    "typical seeing conditions during the observations were around 1 arcsec .",
    "the last column of table 1 provides the number of frames containing a detection of the optical counterpart to a gbs source .",
    "no photometric data are available for cx522 as the source is unresolved from a bright field star in the mosaic - ii data .",
    "the data were reduced via the noao mosaic pipeline which searches and corrects for instrumental artifacts in the image such as cross talk between ccds .",
    "the pipeline applies bias and flat field corrections , and adds a world coordinate system for each image based on usno - b1 stars in the field .",
    "an estimate of the photometric zero - point of the images is also made by comparing the instrumental magnitude of the field star to their usno b1.0 apparent magnitudes .",
    "a detailed explanation of the data reduction procedures can be found in chapter 2 of the noao data handbook ( shaw 2009 ) .",
    "given the uncertain reddening towards the gbs sources and thereby uncertain intrinsic colours , the classification of optical counterparts in this paper was based on the identification of spectral lines and not on the optical continuum measurements .",
    "thus the reduced spectra were normalized by fitting cubic splines to the continuum after masking emission lines , telluric bands and instrumental artifacts .",
    "relevant spectral features were identified and studied .",
    "these include late , early or white dwarf type photospheric lines , emission lines and diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) .",
    "the normalized spectra of the accreting binaries discussed in this paper are presented in fig .",
    "1 to 3 . for the sake of identification ,",
    "the rest wavelengths for the following lines are marked in all figures : h@xmath35 , he i @xmath36 , h@xmath4 and he i @xmath37 ( left panels ) . in the right panels",
    "the markers correspond to the na i doublet @xmath38 , ca ii @xmath39 , p16 , ca ii @xmath40 , p15 , p14 , ca ii @xmath41 , and p13/12/11/10/9 and 8 ( here , p@xmath42 stands for the paschen @xmath43 transition ) .",
    "strong features were examined manually with the _ splot _ task in iraf obtaining their radial velocity ( rv ) , fwhm and equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "the two first parameters were measured by fitting the line profiles with a gaussian function , whereas the ew was measured by means of the _ splot _ keystroke @xmath44 .",
    "table 2 reports the values for the strongest emission lines except for lines which do not have a well - defined profile due to noise and/or telluric contamination problems .",
    "their uncertainties were estimated by looking at the scatter in the values when selecting different wavelength intervals to set the local continuum level .",
    "finally note that all radial velocities provided in the work are heliocentric ones .",
    "coordinates for the optical counterparts to the twenty - three gbs sources discussed in the present work are provided in table 2 . except for cx44",
    ", they were obtained from the vimos pre - images after performing an astrometric calibration that delivered a position accurate to rms @xmath45 arcsec . the position for the optical counterpart to cx44",
    "was derived from mosaic - ii images ( see sec 2.3 ) .",
    "finding charts 20 arcsec @xmath46 20 arcsec wide are shown in the appendix .",
    "observers requiring wider charts can find in table 1 the necessary details to retrieve from the eso archive the pre - images for the target of interest .",
    "photometry was performed using the image subtraction package isis ( alard & lupton 1998 , alard 2000 ) .",
    "isis uses a reference image which is convolved with a kernel in an effort to match a subsequent image of the same field .",
    "this subsequent image is then subtracted from the convolved reference image .",
    "stars which do not vary in magnitude should subtract cleanly , such that the subtracted image is clear of non - variable objects .",
    "therefore , any residual flux is due to an inherent change in brightness of a source .",
    "isis performs psf photometry on the subtracted images .",
    "the model of the psf used in each image is build by convolving the psf model in the reference image with the kernel solution .    in order to save computation time ,",
    "@xmath47 cutouts of the full mosaic - ii images around the position of each x - ray source were taken for processing .",
    "the resulting isis images were examined by eye to identify variable objects near or at the x - ray positions of the gbs sources .",
    "light curves were then built for these variables and lomb - scargle periodograms were used to search for periodicities if enough data points were available .",
    "ellipsoidal modulation is expected in close binaries , in particular in accreting binaries in which the donor star dominates the light curve .",
    "we took into account that this type of photometric variability has two maxima and minima in a single orbital cycle and checked periods twice as long as prominent peaks on a periodogram .",
    "we also consider both aliases and harmonics , as higher harmonics can sometimes appear at a higher power than the fundamental frequency .    at present",
    ", we lack an absolute calibration for these @xmath34- band mosaic - ii data .",
    "all apparent magnitudes cited in this paper are a pipeline calibration product ( see sec 2.3 ) .",
    "they are to be considered rough estimates and thereby used with caution until secondary standards are established for the mosaic - ii fields .",
    "the pipeline zero - point calibration carries an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 mag .",
    "all counterparts were selected for showing ( at least ) h@xmath4 in emission above the continuum . a key motivation of the present work is to report the secure and likely accreting binaries found in this sample and describe the selection criteria used for their identification .",
    "we will report on additional candidate counterparts to x - ray sources that showed no h@xmath4 emission line in their spectrum elsewhere ( see e.g. hynes et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "typically , accreting binaries with hydrogen - rich mass donor stars are unambiguously identified by the presence of broad hydrogen and helium emission lines formed in the gas being accreted .",
    "emission from this gas and/or from a white dwarf primary ( in the case of cvs ) produces a characteristic excess in the optical continuum at blue wavelengths .",
    "we have based the identification of accreting binaries on the detection of strong ( ew@xmath48  , see below ) h@xmath4 in emission , the doppler - broadening of the hydrogen line profiles or the detection of hei @xmath49 emission in the case of observing weak and narrow hydrogen lines . a search for carbon , nitrogen and oxygen emission lines",
    "was also performed .",
    "emission from these heavy elements in a spectrum lacking hydrogen lines is observational evidence for a carbon - oxygen white dwarf donor in an ultra - compact x - ray binary ( see e.g. werner et al .",
    "2006 , nelemans et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "none were found so far in our sample .",
    "chromospherically active binaries and stars can be distinguished from qlmxbs and low - accretion rate cvs by the presence of h@xmath4 emission that does not exceed 15 - 18    in ew .",
    "this limit is observed in m - type stars ( mohanty & basri 2003 , covey et al .",
    "2008 ) and post - common envelope binaries ( bleach et al .",
    "2002 ) , but does not account for the possibility of finding larger ews during a flare event . in active stars line broadening of the h@xmath4 profile can be well above the rotational broadening measured in the photospheric lines and reach up to 9   (= 400 km s@xmath7 ) fwhm in extremely active objects ( see e.g. walter & basri 1982 , torres et al .",
    "the lack of helium in emission above the continuum is also a common characteristic of chromospherically active sources . out of a flare , he i emission above the continuum has been found in a few very active objects ( see bleach et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) . from bleach et al .",
    "one can establish that when present in emission , the he i @xmath50 lines do not exceed 3   in ew .",
    "the he i to h@xmath4 line ratios are @xmath51 even during flares .    pre - main sequence stars that host a circumstellar disc ( classic t tauri stars ) may show permitted lines in emission and mimic the optical and x - ray characteristics of reddened cvs and qlmxbs at a low accretion rate state .",
    "for instance , they can reach x - ray luminosities of up to 10@xmath52 erg s@xmath7 ( telleschi et al . 2007 ) , a value typically observed in quiescent black hole lmxbs , and their optical spectra can exhibit broad hydrogen lines that can appear asymmetric or double - peaked and have ews of hundreds of    ( e.g. reipurth et al . 1996 , hamann & persson 1992 , barrado et al . 2005 ) .",
    "helium lines are often present in the optical spectrum .",
    "fortunately , this young class of objects can be identified on the basis of their association with star formation regions .      through the analysis of the vimos and imacs spectroscopy we have found optical counterparts to 54 gbs sources .",
    "of the 52 optical counterparts with an h@xmath4 emission line found in the data , 29 of them are likely chromospherically active objects as they show narrow ( unresolved ) h@xmath4 emission with ew @xmath53    and a continuum clearly marked by absorption features from a late - type star or binary components . using the simbad database we have not found known star forming regions , star clusters , ob associations or hii regions within one arcmin radius of any of the twenty - three remaining sources . applying the aforementioned ew limit of 18  ,",
    "fifteen of the 23 sources are classified as accreting binaries .",
    "six of the remaining eight objects ( cx70 , cx73 , cx93 , cx137 , cx377 and cx1011 ) have h@xmath4 profiles with fwhm ranging @xmath54  . when subtracting in quadrature the instrumental width , they correspond to intrinsic broadenings of @xmath55   ( @xmath56 km s@xmath57 .",
    "such values are above the 9   maximum broadening observed in chromospherically active sources .",
    "this indicates that the line profiles in these sources are broadened due to the motion of emitting material in an accretion flow or wind .",
    "finally , the gbs sources cx154 and cx781 qualify as likely accreting binaries on the basis of the presence of hei @xmath49 in emission with a hei / h@xmath4 ratio above the value expected from lines powered by chromospheric activity .",
    "thus , we conclude that all twenty - three sources are most likely accreting binaries .    of the 23 gbs sources , five ( cx44 , cx93 , cx137 , cx154 , cx377 and cx1004 )",
    "show , besides the h@xmath4 emission from the accretion disc clear evidence of photospheric absorption lines from the donor star . on the other hand , the spectra of cx28 , cx63 , cx70 , cx128 , cx142 , cx207 , cx522 , cx784 and cx1011 lack absorption features from such a donor . in these nine systems emission from the accreted gas",
    "is the dominant contribution to the total optical light .",
    "the other eight objects require other or more observations to establish with certainty the accretion state and the presence of the donor star in the optical spectrum .",
    "the measured emission line properties provide not only a method to discern accreting binaries from other classes of objects , but also encode a wealth of information on binary parameters such as the system inclination , orbital period , compact object nature or mass accretion rate ( see e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "in particular the centroid of the line profiles originating in a disc with gas in keplerian motion will be shifted by the systemic and primary s radial velocities at the time of the observation : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the orbital phase , @xmath60 the radial velocity semi - amplitudes of the primary and @xmath61 is the systemic radial velocity .",
    "additional velocities incurred by the gas motion in the accretion disc may be present as well . furthermore , the line broadening scales with the mass of the compact object , the system inclination and the orbital period as @xmath62 . in this regard , the low intrinsic fwhm of the h@xmath4 line in cx44 ( @xmath63 km s@xmath7 ) suggests a moderate to low inclination for this system and thereby a low l@xmath60 . thus the large radial velocity offset in the emission lines ( @xmath64 km s@xmath7 ) likely reflect a high @xmath61 given that the rv component due to the motion of the primary is expected to be low . on this basis",
    ", cx44 is a good candidate for an lmxb that experienced a natal kick - cvs in general have low @xmath61 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1996 , ak et al .",
    "the line profiles in cx207 and cx1004 have also significant radial velocity offsets and exhibit the highest line broadening in the sample ( fwhm @xmath65 km s@xmath7 ) in favor of a high inclination for both binaries ( both sources are discussed below ) .",
    "however , caution must be taken with this interpretation of the line properties as departures for the simplistic picture of a keplerian disc are expected and can be dominating the observed @xmath66 fwhm .",
    "for instance , complexities in the line profile morphology can result from tidal effects on the disc ( foulkes et al .",
    "2004 ) and winds that will cause asymmetric profiles .",
    "also , emission originating in regions of the binary system other than the disc can contribute or even dominate the line profile shape and variability .",
    "for instance , this is the case in high - magnetic cvs ( known as polars ) where the magnetic field of the white dwarf prevents the formation of an accretion disc .",
    "emission lines in these systems can originate from the accretion stream that is directed towards the white dwarf s magnetic poles and from the ( irradiated ) donor star . as discussed below",
    ", a high - magnetic cv is the favoured scenario to explain the emission line properties in cx207 .",
    "in what follows , we discuss the spectroscopy and photometry of the twenty - three accreting binaries .",
    "we describe remarkable features and provide a characterization of the gbs source on their basis .",
    "when useful we will employ the absolute magnitudes and colors of stars as given in allen s astrophysical quantities ( cox 2000 ) and apply the transformation equations between johnson - cousins and sdss magnitude derived by jester et al .",

    "<S> we are undertaking a survey to characterize the x - ray sources found with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory in a strip of fields at @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) targets x - ray emitting binaries in the bulge with the primary purpose of finding quiescent x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the aims of this survey are to quantify dynamically the mass of compact objects in these x - ray binaries in order to constrain the neutron star equation of state and to test black hole formation models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , using the survey number counts of various sources we aim to test models for binary formation and evolution . here , we present the identification of optical counterparts to twenty - three gbs x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> we report their accurate coordinates and medium resolution optical spectra acquired at the very large telescope and magellan . </S>",
    "<S> all sources are classified as accreting binaries according to their emission line characteristics . to distinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop and explain criteria based on h@xmath4 and hei @xmath5 emission line properties available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic properties and photometric variability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the source is given where possible . among the twenty - three systems , at least nine of them show an accretion - dominated optical spectrum ( cx28 , cx63 , cx70 , cx128 , cx142 , cx207 , cx522 , cx794 cx1011 ) and another six show photospheric lines from a late - type donor star in addition to accretion disc emission ( cx44 , cx93 , cx137 , cx154 , cx377 and cx1004 ) indicating that they are probably accreting binaries in quiescence or in a low accretion rate state . </S>",
    "<S> two sources are confirmed to be eclipsing : cx207 and cx794 . </S>",
    "<S> cx207 shows a broad asymmetric h@xmath4 profile blue - shifted by @xmath6 km s@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> such line profile characteristics are consistent with a magnetic ( polar ) cataclysmic variable . </S>",
    "<S> cx794 is an eclipsing nova - like cataclysmic variable in the period gap . </S>",
    "<S> time - resolved photometry and the large broadening of the h@xmath4 emission lines in cx446 ( 2100 km s@xmath7 full - width at half maximum ; fwhm ) suggest that this is also an eclipsing or high - inclination accreting binary . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the low - accretion rate source cx1004 shows a double - peaked h@xmath4 profile with a fwhm of 2100 km s@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this supports a high inclination or even eclipsing system . </S>",
    "<S> whether the compact object is a white dwarf in an eclipsing cataclysmic variable or a black hole primary in a high - inclination low - mass x - ray binary remains to be established .    </S>",
    "<S> techniques : spectroscopic , photometric , radial velocities ; binaries : close ; accretion , accretion discs ; black hole physics ; stars : neutron ; x  rays : binaries </S>"
