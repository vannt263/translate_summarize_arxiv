    "a first - order electroweak phase transition may explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "indeed , such a phase transition would provide all the sakharov conditions , namely , baryon number violation , @xmath0 and @xmath1 violation , and a departure from thermal equilibrium . for a quantitatively successful electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb )",
    "an extension of the standard model ( sm ) is needed , such that there is enough @xmath1 violation as well as a sufficiently strong first - order phase transition . in the standard mechanism for ewb ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , the departure from equilibrium acts in two different ways . on the one hand ,",
    "the expansion of bubbles of the broken - symmetry phase builds up non - equilibrium particle densities in front of the bubble walls .",
    "these densities are asymmetric for left handed particles and their antiparticles due to @xmath1 violating interactions with the wall .",
    "this asymmetry is transported to the unbroken - symmetry phase , where it biases the weak sphaleron processes which violate baryon number .",
    "the generated baryon asymmetry reenters the broken - symmetry phase . as a result",
    ", the bubble walls leave behind a net baryon number density . on the other hand , before this baryon number density recovers the equilibrium , the baryon number violating processes should be turned off .",
    "otherwise the generated bau would be washed out .",
    "such a suppression of the sphaleron processes indeed occurs inside the bubble , as long as the higgs background field @xmath2 in the broken - symmetry phase satisfies the well known condition @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 plays the role of an order parameter , and the condition ( [ washout ] ) expresses the baryogenesis requirement of a strongly first - order phase transition .",
    "although for a higgs mass as large as @xmath6 the electroweak phase transition is a smooth crossover , many extensions of the sm give strongly first - order phase transitions .",
    "most investigations of ewb concentrate in the value of the order parameter @xmath5 and the sources of cp violation for specific models .",
    "since the computation of the velocity @xmath7 of bubble walls is too involved , a specific value is often assumed ( typically @xmath8 ) to obtain a result for the bau . however , the generated bau has also an important dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , for very small velocities thermal equilibrium is restored and a small baryon asymmetry is generated . on the other hand , if the wall velocity is too large the diffusion of left - handed density perturbations is not efficient , and the resulting baryon number density is again small . in other words ,",
    "a departure from equilibrium is needed , but such a departure should not be too strong . as a consequence ,",
    "the generated baryon asymmetry has a maximum for a certain wall velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 depends on the time scales associated to particle diffusion and baryon number violation , and is in general in the range @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a sizeable bau is more easily obtained if @xmath7 is close to @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , any model which gives supersonic velocities is in conflict with the standard ewb mechanism @xcite .",
    "subsonic wall velocities are possible due to the friction with the plasma , which generally causes the walls to reach a terminal velocity .",
    "this velocity is given by the balance between the driving force , which depends on the pressure in the two phases , and the friction force , which depends on the microscopic interactions of the bubble wall with plasma particles .",
    "the driving force is very sensitive to hydrodynamics . as a consequence of non - linear hydrodynamics , there are different kinds of stationary solutions for the propagation of the wall @xcite .",
    "the solutions which can be realized in a cosmological phase transition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are _ weak deflagrations _",
    ", which are subsonic , _ jouguet deflagrations _ , which are supersonic , and _ jouguet or weak detonations _ , which are supersonic too",
    "hence , the case of interest for baryogenesis is that of weak deflagrations .",
    "it is well known that the stationary propagation of a weak deflagration front may be unstable @xcite . for the case of a relativistic equation of state",
    ", the stability of deflagrations was first studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the result was that deflagrations are always unstable under perturbations above a certain wavelength .",
    "this analysis was improved in ref .",
    "the main improvement was to take into account the dependence of the stationary velocity on the temperature .",
    "the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the deflagration is stable for wall velocities above a certain critical value @xmath13 .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite agree with such a stabilization . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results of @xcite were improved by taking into account temperature fluctuations on both sides of the wall , as well as the fact that the reheating due to the release of latent heat depends on the wall velocity .",
    "for small amounts of supercooling , the results of ref .  @xcite agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability analysis was applied to the electroweak phase transition for the minimal standard model with unrealistic values of the higgs mass , which gives a strong enough phase transition for ewb . for higgs masses higher than @xmath14 ,",
    "the critical velocity below which deflagrations are unstable was found to be @xmath15 .",
    "this result was compared with the wall velocity calculations @xcite , which gave @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that the electroweak deflagration is stable .",
    "however , both @xmath9 and @xmath13 depend on the model and should be recalculated for each extension of the sm .",
    "the calculation of @xmath9 is more involved than that of @xmath13 and depends on more details of the model .",
    "indeed , the value of the critical velocity depends only on thermodynamical parameters which can be derived from the free energy density .",
    "in contrast , the actual value of the stationary velocity depends ( besides thermodynamics and hydrodynamics ) on the friction of the wall with the plasma .",
    "the computation of the friction force involves considering boltzmann equations for the out - of - equilibrium particle densities in front of the wall . for the sm , a thorough calculation ( including reheating effects ) @xcite gave wall velocities in the range @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "a similar calculation for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite gave smaller velocities , @xmath19 , due to the larger particle content of this model ( essentially , due to the contribution of top squarks ) .",
    "to our knowledge , these two results constitute the only detailed microphysics calculations for specific models .",
    "the reason for this is the difficulty of computing the collision terms for the boltzmann equations . in spite of this",
    ", many investigations of the friction were performed . in particular , a study of the overdamped evolution of gauge fields @xcite showed that infrared boson excitations generally increase the friction and , consequently , cause smaller wall velocities than previous studies . in particular ,",
    "for the sm the estimated wall velocity was @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper we shall investigate the possible instability of the electroweak wall velocity for several extensions of the sm .",
    "the main motivation for this is the fact that the deflagration instability may affect the baryogenesis scenario . indeed ,",
    "notice that the value of @xmath13 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite lies within the optimal range for ewb .",
    "moreover , given the general uncertainties and large errors in the estimations of @xmath9 , the value of @xmath13 , which is much easier to calculate , provides a lower bound for @xmath9 which may be important to constrain baryogenesis .",
    "it is worth mentioning also that an instability of the stationary wall propagation may have several cosmological consequences , such as the generation of magnetic fields @xcite or gravitational waves @xcite .",

    "the electroweak phase transition is just a smooth crossover . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we shall consider several extensions of the sm for which the electroweak phase transition is first - order .    for a first - order phase transition , there is a range of temperatures around @xmath28 for which the effective potential has two minima separated by a barrier . for @xmath29 the symmetric minimum",

    "the energy density and pressure for each phase are obtained from the free energy density through @xmath38 , where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to the temperature .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs via the nucleation and expansion of bubbles .",
    "as we shall see , the relevant parameters for our calculation will be the latent heat @xmath39 defined as @xmath40 , the enthalpy density before the phase transition , @xmath41 , and the nucleation temperature @xmath42 .",
    "the latter is the temperature at which bubbles effectively begin to nucleate .",

    "the bubble walls quickly reach a terminal velocity due to the friction with the plasma .",
    "we shall concentrate in such a case . from the time a bubble nucleates to the time their walls collide with other bubbles , the temperature of the plasma varies due to the adiabatic expansion of the universe and due to the release of latent heat . as a consequence ,",
    "the wall velocity will vary too .",
    "we shall use @xmath44 as a representative value for the temperature of the phase transition .",
    "the motion of a bubble wall can be derived from the equation for the higgs field in the plasma ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath45with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are the @xmath26-dependent particle masses , @xmath48 are the deviations of particle densities from equilibrium , and the sum runs over all particle species .",
    "the last term gives the friction with the plasma . in order to transform eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) into an equation for the bubble wall , the general procedure is to use some approximation or ansatz for the field profile ( which is static in the reference frame of the wall ) and integrate across the wall . since the deviations @xmath48 depend on the wall velocity , the last term in ( [ eqphi ] ) gives the friction force @xmath49 , while the second term gives the driving force @xmath50",
    "thus , the steady state velocity of a bubble wall is given by the force balance @xmath51 ( for a more detailed explanation , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the driving force is relatively easy to calculate . in particular ,",
    "if the temperature remains constant across the wall , we have @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the friction is proportional to the departure of the plasma particles from their equilibrium distributions .",
    "this departure from equilibrium depends not only on the interaction of the particles with the higgs field at the wall , but also on the interactions of plasma particles away from the wall .",
    "thus , the calculation involves solving a system of boltzmann equations for the population densities of the relevant species .",
    "the boltzmann equations include collision terms which must be computed by calculating the scattering rates for all the relevant processes .",
    "such a calculation is often referred to as the _ microphysics _ calculation .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the microphysics calculation is very difficult . in particular ,",
    "the computation of the collision terms was carried out only for a couple of models and in the non - relativistic ( nr ) case @xcite .",
    "the result is a friction force of the form @xmath53 .",

    "the ultra - relativistic ( ur ) limit has also been considered @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this limit is even simpler than the nr case .",
    "the result is that the friction saturates for @xmath55 , i.e. , the friction force reaches a velocity - independent value @xmath56 .",
    "intermediate cases are much more difficult to treat . in a recent treatment @xcite ,",
    "the friction was considered beyond the small wall velocity regime .",
    "however , the deviations from equilibrium were still considered to be small .",

    "@xcite does not match the ur results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to overcome the difficulties of the microphysics calculation ,",

    "if we ignore hydrodynamics , this approach gives a friction force of the form @xmath59 in the nr limit , where the coefficient @xmath60 is a free parameter coming from the phenomenological damping term .",
    "hence , setting @xmath60 to the value @xmath54 from the microphysics calculation gives the correct friction force in this limit .",
    "this phenomenological model extrapolates the nr behavior @xmath61 to a force of the form @xmath62 for relativistic velocities , where @xmath63 is the velocity of the fluid relative to the wall ( which will vary across the wall , see below ) .",
    "however , this simple model does not give the friction saturation in the ur limit . in order to reproduce the saturating behavior , in ref .",
    "@xcite a phenomenological model which gives a friction force of the form @xmath64 was considered .",

    "there is a characteristic scale in the problem ( see @xcite for details ) , which is given by @xmath338 , where @xmath205 is the surface tension and @xmath50 is the driving force .",
    "thus , the deflagration wall is unstable for wavelengths @xmath129 which are higher than a critical value @xmath339 .",
    "the instabilities develop once the bubble reaches a size @xmath340 .",
    "the quantity @xmath341 is generally of the order of the initial bubble size .",
    "in contrast , the final bubble size @xmath342 is in general much higher than @xmath341 . as a consequence",
    ", there will be instabilities in the range @xmath343 .",
    "to be more precise , in the limit of small supercooling , small latent heat , and small velocity we have @xmath344 $ ] . therefore ,",
    "unless @xmath9 is very close to @xmath13 , we have @xmath345 .",
    "although @xmath346 may be quite small and , hence , @xmath347 may be a few orders of magnitude larger than @xmath341 , the final bubble size @xmath342 will still be many orders of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath342 is related to the cosmological time @xmath348 ( where @xmath280 is the hubble rate ) , while @xmath341 is given by thermodynamical variables .",
    "roughly , we have @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the planck mass . for the electroweak phase transition we have @xmath351 .",
    "hence , the instabilities generally begin to grow when bubbles are still very small . on the other hand ,",
    "the instabilities need time to develop .",
    "the growth rate @xmath95 in the linear regime is proportional to @xmath352 and to @xmath353 .",
    "a simple dynamical analysis shows that ( in the approximation @xmath354 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 ) the instabilities become important when the bubble size reaches the value @xmath357^{-2}d$ ] @xcite .",
    "again , even though @xmath110 may be quite small we will have @xmath358 unless @xmath9 is extremely close to @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the instabilities become important very early in the development of the phase transition .",
    "as already discussed , the instability of the deflagration may spoil the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis if the wall accelerates and reaches supersonic velocities .",
    "in fact , the linear stability analysis breaks down as the perturbations grow .",
    "therefore , @xmath95 only indicates the initial acceleration rate of the unstable wall .",
    "it is in principle possible that nonlinear effects stabilize the propagation of the phase transition front .",
    "in such a case , one may expect that the wall reaches a new stationary regime , perhaps with a higher velocity .",
    "notice , however , that this new regime will not correspond to a stable weak deflagration , unless the conditions which determine @xmath7 change .",
    "all other known stationary solutions ( namely , jouguet deflagrations and weak detonations ) are supersonic .",
    "there are ( at least ) two possible alternatives to this situation .",
    "since the instabilities corrugate the wall , the growth of the bubble may be of dendritic type @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics in this case may differ significantly from the case of planar ( or spherical ) walls , and there may be new stationary propagation modes .",
    "another possibility is that , by the time the instabilities begin to become noticeable , the shock fronts coming from other bubbles already hit the wall .",
    "this may happen for small enough @xmath9 , since the shock velocity is supersonic .",
    "in such a case , the plasma outside the bubble will be reheated from the initial temperature @xmath120 to a higher temperature @xmath359 .",
    "this reheating will tend to decrease both @xmath9 and @xmath13 , but the overall effect may be stabilizing . indeed , the release of latent heat may reheat the plasma up to @xmath28 .",
    "in such a case the phase transition necessarily slows down @xcite .",
    "the effects of such a reheating on electroweak baryogenesis have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "leaving aside these possibilities , the critical velocity sets a lower bound for the velocity of stationary phase transition fronts .",
    "this lower bound for the wall velocity may be used to constrain models of ewb in two ways . on the one hand , if the wall velocity for a given model is calculated and turns out to be below @xmath13 , then in principle the wall will accelerate to velocities which are too high for ewb .",
    "this would rule out this model as a baryogenesis scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "since an accurate calculation of @xmath9 is too difficult and model - dependent , using the value of @xmath13 as a lower bound may be useful .",
    "this lower bound may constrain the baryogenesis mechanism if @xmath13 turns out to be too large .",
    "interestingly , besides the potentially negative consequences for baryogenesis , the instability of slow walls may give rise to new cosmological consequences for weak phase transitions .",
    "indeed , the instabilities lead to acceleration of the walls , anisotropic growth of bubbles and turbulence of the plasma",
    ". these effects may give origin to magnetic fields @xcite or gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it is known that the stationary motion of phase transition fronts may be unstable for subsonic velocities .",
    "specifically , the deflagration front is hydrodynamically unstable below a critical velocity @xmath13 . in order to discuss the implications of this fact for the electroweak phase transition , we have computed both the wall velocity and the critical velocity for several extensions of the standard model .",
    "we have considered a significant variety of models and a wide range of parameters , including those which are favorable for baryogenesis .",
    "the general result is that the deflagration tends to be unstable for very weak or very strong phase transitions , while for phase transitions with an order parameter @xmath360 the deflagrations are generally stable . in general , for any model there is a range of parameters for which we have stable deflagrations .",
    "the stability condition @xmath249 constitutes in principle a restriction for electroweak baryogenesis ( assuming that , if it is not fulfilled , the wall will accelerate to supersonic velocities ) .",
    "this condition , combined with that of avoiding the washout of the generated bau ( i.e. , @xmath361 ) , the requirement of enough cp violation , and experimental bounds , may restrict significantly some models .",
    "we remark that , even if we have a subsonic wall with @xmath362 , a departure of the wall velocity from the range @xmath363 , where the bau has its maximum , may also prevent a quantitatively successful ewb . in all the models we considered we found a region of parameter space",
    "for which the deflagration is stable and the above conditions for @xmath247 and @xmath7 are fulfilled .",
    "we stress that the friction is very model - dependent , and current calculations have large errors which propagate to the wall velocity . for velocities close to the speed of sound",
    ", such @xmath271 factors may determine whether the wall propagates as a deflagration or a detonation .",
    "similarly , for wall velocities close to the critical value , @xmath271 variations of the friction will determine the stability or instability of the deflagration .",
    "the calculation of the critical velocity is not easy either .",
    "we have used the analytic results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were obtained using several approximations , such as the bag eos and the assumption of planar walls .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath13 is less dependent on details of the specific model ( i.e. , it depends only on thermodynamical parameters ) . in the appendix",
    "we give a simple fit for @xmath13 as a function of the parameters @xmath364 and @xmath111 .",
    "we also remark that we have used for our calculations a simple phenomenological model for the friction force .",
    "we have argued that this approximation should be good at least for the case of small wall velocities which are required for baryogenesis .",
    "the actual value of @xmath13 is possibly higher than our result .",
    "hence , our calculation gives only a conservative lower bound for the velocity of a stable deflagration .",

    "<S> the subsonic expansion of bubbles in a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition is a convenient scenario for electroweak baryogenesis . for most extensions of the standard model , stationary subsonic solutions ( i.e. , deflagrations ) exist for the propagation of phase transition fronts . </S>",
    "<S> however , deflagrations are known to be hydrodynamically unstable for wall velocities below a certain critical value . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate this critical velocity for several extensions of the standard model and compare with an estimation of the wall velocity . in general </S>",
    "<S> , we find a region in parameter space which gives stable deflagrations as well as favorable conditions for electroweak baryogenesis . </S>"
