    "before applying a diagnostic test in clinical settings , a rigorous statistical assessment of its performance in discriminating the disease status from the non - disease status is necessary . for a continuous - scale test @xmath0 , the diagnosis is dependent upon whether the test result is above or below a specified cut point @xmath1 assuming , without loss of generality , that higher test values indicate a higher likelihood of disease , a result is called positive if its value exceeds the cut point , and negative otherwise . a positive test indicates presence of the disease .    at a fixed cut point @xmath2",
    ", the accuracy of the test can be evaluated by its true positive rate ( tpr ) and its true negative rate ( tnr ) , which are defined as the probabilities that the test correctly identifies the diseaded and non - diseaded subjects , respectively .",
    "the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve is the plot of tpr versus 1-tnr by varying the cut point @xmath2 . usually , the roc curve is monotone and lies in the upper triangle of the unit square , which consist of three vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the shape of roc curve allows to evaluate the ability of the test .",
    "for example , a roc curve equal to a straight line joining points @xmath5 and @xmath4 represents a diagnostic tests which is the random guess .",
    "a commonly used summary measure that aggregates performance information across the range of possible cut points is the area under roc curve ( auc ) .",
    "reasonable values of auc range from 0.5 , suggesting that the test is no better than chance alone , to 1.0 , which indicates a perfect test .    clearly , the roc curve and the auc of a test under assessment are unknown and the statistical evaluation of the test requires suitable inferential procedures .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite as general references . in principle ,",
    "knowledge of the true disease status of the subjects under study is obtained by the most accurate available test , called gold standard ( gs ) test . in practice",
    ", there may be many drawbacks to implement the gs test , which can be too expensive , or too invasive , or both for regular use .",
    "thus , often only a subset of patients undergoes disease verification and the decision to send a patient to verification typically depends on the test result and other patient characteristic .",
    "statistical evaluations based only on data from subjects with verified disease status are typically biased .",
    "this bias is known as verification bias .    in the last fifteen years",
    ", various methods have been developed to deal with the verification bias problem , most of which assume that the true disease status , if missing , is missing at random ( mar , @xcite ) . among the others , we cite the papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in particular , @xcite proposed four types of partially parametric estimators of tpr and tnr , i.e. , full imputation ( fi ) , mean score imputation ( msi ) , inverse probability weighting ( ipw ) and semiparametric efficient ( spe ) estimators .",
    "in some medical studies , however , the disease status often involves more than two categories ; for example , alzheimer s dementia can be classified into three categories ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in such situations , quantities used to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test are the true class fractions ( tcf s ) . these are well defined as a generalization of tpr and tnr . in a three  class",
    "diagnostic problem , given a pair of cut points @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , subjects are classified into class 1 if @xmath8 ; class 2 if @xmath9 ; and class 3 otherwise .",
    "the true class fractions of the test @xmath0 at @xmath6 are defined as @xmath10 the plot of ( tcf@xmath11 , tcf@xmath12 , tcf@xmath13 ) by varying the pair @xmath6 produces the roc surface of @xmath0 in the unit cube . @xcite and @xcite mentioned that a roc surface is well defined as a generalization of the roc curve .",
    "indeed , the projection of roc surface to the plane defined by tcf@xmath12 versus tcf@xmath11 yields the roc curve between classes 1 and 2 .",
    "similarly , on projecting the roc surface to the plane defined by the axes tcf@xmath12 and tcf@xmath13 , the roc curve between classes 2 and 3 is produced ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the roc surface will be the triangular plane with vertices @xmath14 , and @xmath15 if all of three tcf s are equal for every pair @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", we say that the diagnostic test is the random guess , again . in practice ,",
    "one can imagine that the graph of roc surface lies in the unit cube and above the plane of the triangle with three vertices @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "a summary of the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test under consideration is the volume under the roc surface ( vus ) which can be seen as a generalization of the auc .",
    "reasonable values of vus vary from 1/6 to 1 , ranging from bad to perfect diagnostic tests .",
    "@xcite and @xcite gave some interesting results about roc surface analysis in absence of verification bias .",
    "in particular , the authors formularized the roc surface by a functional form and proposed a nonparametric approach for vus estimation . again without verification bias , parametric estimation of vus is supplied in the work of @xcite , where the assumption of normality distribution was used , whereas @xcite tackled the nonparametric and semi - parametric estimation of the roc surface .",
    "@xcite proposed a regression approach to roc surface , and in @xcite a kernel smoothing based approach for estimation of vus is employed .",
    "the issue of correcting for the verification bias in roc surface analysis is very scarcely considered in the statistical literature . until now",
    ", only @xcite discussed about the issue .",
    "the authors proposed maximum likelihood estimates for roc surface and vus .",
    "however , these results only concern ordinal diagnostic tests .",
    "this motivated us to develop bias - corrected methods for continuous diagnostic tests with three  class disease status .    in this paper",
    ", we propose several verification bias - corrected estimators of tcf@xmath11 , tcf@xmath12 and tcf@xmath13 for continuous diagnostic tests .",
    "the proposed estimators are the extension of fi , msi , ipw and spe estimators for the roc curves in @xcite .",
    "the new estimators allow to obtain bias - corrected roc surfaces .",
    "corresponding estimators of the vus are also presented .",
    "consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established under the mar assumption .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the estimators of roc curves discussed in @xcite .",
    "the proposed extension , giving bias - corrected estimators of the roc surface and of vus , is presented in section 3 , along with the relevant asymptotic results . in section 4 ,",
    "some simulation results are produced and two applications of the methods are contained in section 5 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we review the approaches presented in @xcite for bias  corrected roc analysis in two  class problems .",
    "let us consider a study with @xmath16 subjects , for whom the result of a continuous test @xmath0 is available .",
    "the patient s true condition ( or disease status ) , @xmath17 , is defined by a gs test .",
    "@xmath17 is a binary variable , that is @xmath18 if the subject is healthy and @xmath19 in case of disease .",
    "further , let @xmath20 be a binary verification status of a patient , such that @xmath21 if he / she is underwent the gs test , and @xmath22 otherwise . in practice",
    ", some information , other than the test results , can be obtained for each patient .",
    "let @xmath23 be a covariate vector for a patient , that may be associated with both @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "for the sake of reader s convenience , without loss of generality , in what follows we will consider @xmath23 to be univariate .",
    "we assume that the verification status @xmath20 and the response @xmath17 are mutually independent given the test result @xmath0 and covariate @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 or , equivalently , @xmath25 .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the mar assumption .",
    "let fpr = 1-tnr .",
    "when all subjects are verified by gs , we have a full ( or complete ) data set . for a given cut point @xmath2 , tpr and fpr",
    "are @xmath26 then , one can employ the empirical estimators @xmath27 and @xmath28 to obtain the nonparametric estimators of tpr and fpr @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the indicator function .",
    "if not all patients have their disease status verified , the nonparametric estimators ( [ npfull ] ) can not be computed .",
    "if one computes the nave estimators , i.e. , estimators ( [ npfull ] ) based only on verified subjects , typically gets estimates that are biased and inconsistent .",
    "@xcite proposed four partially parametric estimators to assess continuous diagnostic ( or screening ) tests under the mar assumption .",
    "in particular , fi estimators of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath33 here , the estimates @xmath34 of @xmath35 are obtained by using some suitable parametric model ( e.g. , logistic regression model ) computed from verified subjects .",
    "msi estimators only imputes the disease status for subjects who did not undergo the gs , resulting to be @xmath36 ipw method weights each verified subject by the inverse of the conditional verification probability @xmath37 ( i.e. the probability that the subject is selected for verification ) .",
    "therefore , the estimators are @xmath38 again , the estimates @xmath39 need to be obtained by using parametric regression models such as logistic or probit models .",
    "finally , spe estimators are defined as : @xmath40 alonzo and pepe @xcite showed that spe estimators are doubly robust because they are consistent if either the @xmath41 s or the @xmath42 s are consistently estimated .",
    "however , it is worth noting that spe estimates may not be range - respecting , i.e. , they could fall outside the interval @xmath43 .",
    "this happens because the quantities @xmath44 or @xmath45 can be negative .    for each of the above methods ,",
    "an estimated bias - corrected roc curve can be obtained by plotting @xmath46 versus @xmath47 for all cut points @xmath2 .",
