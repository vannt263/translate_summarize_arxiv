    "self - assembled semiconductor quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) , a system composed of at least two closely - spaced quantum dots ( qds ) , have attracted broad attention for both studies of fundamental physics and development of next - generation optoelectronic devices.@xcite .",

    "consequently , electrons participating in the pl emission must be optically generated .",
    "under moderate excitation laser intensity , the number of electrons occupied a single lqdm during the pl emission should be no more than one . therefore , pl lines that show up at negative bias are assigned to either neutral exciton ( @xmath5 ) or positive trion ( @xmath3 ) states . due to the anisotropic self - assembly growth mechanism of the lqdms sample ,",
    "it is unlikely that the energy difference between two neighboring qds would consistently be 0.4 to 0.5 mev .",
    "this suggests that the two consistently observed pair of pl lines separated by 0.5 mev should not be assigned to two separate qds .    to support the assignment that the high energy pl is from neutral exciton emission and the low energy pl line is from positive trion emission , we look at the electric field and laser power dependence of the intensities of these lines .",

    "line @xmath2 and @xmath4 both have low intensity until a certain voltage and then gain intensity abruptly .",
    "the intensity of pl emission from @xmath5 and @xmath3 depends on the efficiency of two processes .",
    "first , the @xmath3 configuration is more likely to form at low bias , when it is relatively easy for an optically generated electron to tunnel out of the lqdm , leaving behind an excess optically - generated hole , thereby increasing the probability that the @xmath3 will form .",

    "compared with holes , electrons have a smaller effective mass and are able to tunnel out of qds more rapidly .",
    "the formation of the @xmath3 necessarily requires two photons .",
    "one photon generates an electron hole pair from which the electron tunnels out , leaving a hole behind .",
    "the second photon generates an additional electron hole pair , allowing recombination of an electron hole pair in the presence of the additional hole .",
    "consequently , formation of the @xmath3 state requires more photons than formation of @xmath5 state .",
    "the superliner laser power dependence of intensities of lines @xmath3/@xmath3 , relative to @xmath5 , indicates that these pl line should be assigned to the positive trion states .",
    "this laser power dependence allows us to assign line @xmath2 to emission involving neutral excitons .",
    "the end result of the analysis based on the data shown in fig .",
    "[ positivef](c ) and ( d ) allows us to conclude that line @xmath2 and line @xmath4 are both from the recombination of neutral excitons ( x0 ) while line @xmath3 and @xmath3 are the pl recombination with a spectator hole ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we believe that @xmath4 is weaker than @xmath2 because it is energetically favorable for the electron to relax to the lower energy ( right ) qd .",
    "the red shift of @xmath3 relative to @xmath5 differs from the case of single qds@xcite and vqdms@xcite , where blue shifts of the @xmath3 state are typically observed .",
    "this red shift is one of the distinct pl properties of lqdms that has been predicted by both pseudopotential@xcite and effective mass@xcite modeling . in the @xmath6 initial state",
    ", one electron - hole pair sits in the right qd and the remaining hole in the left qd . if the qds have very different energies , tunnel coupling is negligible and the electron - hole pair only feels the nearby hole as a static electric field .",
    "this reduces the exciton binding energy leading to a coulomb - induced red shift .",
    "if the qd energies are similar enough , the electron may tunnel between the two qds .",
    "this leads to an additional tunnelling - induced red shift of the @xmath6 emission.@xcite in order to determine whether the red shift of @xmath6 in fig .  [ positivef](a ) is due to coulomb coupling or to tunnel coupling , further information is needed .",
    "the presence of a splitting between @xmath6 and @xmath7 lines gives us a hint that can be interpreted from comparison with theoretical calculations in order to definitely assign these states to specific charge configurations .",
    "the lqdm pl spectra are computed as a function of charge configurations using the model and material parameters described in ref .  .",
    "we take a typical distance between qd centers of @xmath8 nm , and parabolic confinement frequencies of @xmath9 mev and @xmath10 mev , consistent with the experimental qd sizes and the energy splitting between @xmath11 and @xmath12 lines .",
    "since the hole is more confined than the electron , we assume the characteristic lengths to be related by @xmath13 .",
    "the energy gap is taken so as to fit the energy of the @xmath2 line .",
    "the resulting pl spectrum for @xmath6 is plotted in figure  [ positivef](e ) .    to clearly indicate the charge configurations",
    ", we use the notation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ) indicates the number of electrons in the left ( right ) qd .",
    "similarly for holes .",
    "for example @xmath17 describes a lqdm with one electron in the right qd and one hole in each qd .    as shown in figure  [ positivef](e ) , there are two peaks that originate in pl emission from the initial state @xmath17 .",
    "the presence of one hole in each qd breaks the coulomb attraction that binds the electron to a single qd and electron tunneling leads to the formation of a delocalized electron state .",
    "the delocalized electron can recombine with both holes , in either the left or right qd , and emit pl at slightly different energies .",
    "compared with the direct recombination involving only electron and hole in the right qd , the indirect @xmath3 recombination exhibit significant lower intensity because relatively small probability of tunneling of electron .",
    "this allows us to assign x+ to the direct recombination of ( 01,11 ) and x+ to the indirect recombination .",
    "the modeling result is also in good quantitative agreement with the data in fig .",
    "[ positivef](a ) .",
    "to explain the relative intensities of multiple @xmath5 and @xmath3 pl lines , we consider the dynamics of charge relaxation within the lqdm . normally , when an e - h pair is optically excited , the electrons relax first and the hole follows , with coulomb interactions driving the hole toward the same qd . the electron and hole can relax into either qd , but it is energetically favorable for them to relax into the lower energy ( right ) qd . by measuring the energy difference between the two @xmath5 pl lines shown in figure  [ positivef](a ) and figure  [ lqdm1f](a ) , we learn that the @xmath3 state of lqdm 1 is 1.6 mev below the @xmath5 , which is relatively small .",
    "this nearly - degenerate structure enables the optically or electrically injected electrons to relax to both left and right dots when no charges occupy the lqdm . for applied voltage below v1 ,",
    "@xmath5 pl emission from both the left and right qds are observed because the electron can relax into either qd and the hole will follow the electron into the same qd .",
    "electron - hole pairs relax more often into the low energy qd ( right ) , therefore , we see @xmath18 has stronger pl intensities than @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , if the optically - excited electron tunnels out of the qds and leaves the hole behind , it is energetically favorable for the hole to relax to the bigger qd ( right ) , which has a lower energy confined state .",
    "although the hole tunneling is slower than electron tunneling , the hole lifetime is limited by tunneling escape from the lqdm , not radiative recombination , and thus there is significant opportunity for the hole to relax .",
    "the presence of this hole in the right qd drives the electron to localize into the right qd .",
    "consequently , we do not see emission from a positive trion state in which the electron is predominantly located in the left qd ( includes @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the optically excited hole will relax into the left qd because of hole - hole repulsion and serve as a spectator charge of the pl emission @xmath22 as a direct recombination . as is discussed previously , the interdot tunneling of the single electron allows weak indirect recombination and emitted pl signal marked as @xmath23 .",
    "we observe emission involving both positive trion and neutral excitons in the bias region to the left of v1 because the ccd integrates over multiple optical excitation and emission cycles that randomly contain both @xmath3 and @xmath5 events .",
    "the relative probability of these events is influenced by the laser power density as described above .",
    "as the applied voltage moves the confined states of the qds past the fermi level , additional electrons tunnel into the lqdm .",
    "this leads to a sequence of charging events and discrete shifts in the energies of ground state pl emission , as shown in figure 3a . in order to understand the mechanism and consequences of this charging sequence in lqdms",
    ", we systemically study the ground state spectra of lqdm 1 , as a function of increasing applied voltage , by compare the experimental pl signatures with the theoretical modeling results . the charge configuration for almost all pl lines in fig .  [ lqdm1f](a )",
    "are assigned and indicated by the inset labels .",
    "we now justify and explain these assignments .",
    "the first observation is that there are four values of the applied voltage ( v1 through v4 at which discrete shifts in the pl spectra occur .",
    "these shifts occur as the increasing vertical bias moves confined energy states .",
    "the increasing of the vertical bias drives the conduction band across the fermi level and electrically injects electrons one by one as is shown in fig .",
    "[ lqdm1f](b ) .",
    "the first group of pl lines , appearing for voltages above v1 , are assigned to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and@xmath27 , all of which have two electrons and one hole . in each of these configurations",
    "at least one electron is in the right qd . the second , optically generated , electron can relax into either the left or right qd .",
    "the hole , which typically relaxes more slowly , can also relax into either qd .",
    "we do not observe any lines assigned to @xmath28 because coulomb attraction makes it unlikely that the hole will relax into a qd with no electrons .",
    "the pl emission of @xmath29 can only happen when both the electrically - injected electron and optically - generated electron - hole pair occupy the left qd . because the conduction level of the left qd is a little higher than the right one",
    ", the electrically - generated electron can be injected into the left qd only at voltages slightly higher than v1 .    at the same time that the @xmath24 pl lines appear at v1 ,",
    "the @xmath3 pl line @xmath17 disappears .",
    "this occurs because electrical charging of the lqdm with a single electron makes it impossible for a single optically - generated hole to remain in the lqdm . for voltages larger than v1 , the pl line @xmath19 gains significant optical intensity",
    "this occurs because the probability that an electron relaxes to the higher energy ( left ) qd increases in the absence of a single hole in the right qd . both neutral exciton states are observed at voltages above v1 , despite the expectation that the lqdm should be charged with an excess electron .",
    "this is because the relaxation of the optically - generated electron into the lqdm can be blocked by both coulomb and the pauli interactions with the electron / s already occupying the lqdm .",
    "this relaxation blockade can force the electron to remain , temporarily , in a higher energy confined state from which tunneling out of the lqdm is more probable .",
    "it is therefore possible to observe pl emission of both charge states near the charging point .",
    "similar processes lead to overlap of emission from other total charge states.@xcite .    fig .",
    "[ lqdm1f](c ) compares experimental ( dotted lines ) and theoretical ( solid and dashed lines ) pl energies for different excitonic complexes .",
    "the dashed lines in @xmath3 column represent the pl emissions that are energetically unfavorable , as is discussed in last section .",
    "good agreement is found for @xmath6 and @xmath30 , as well as for @xmath31 complexes containing all charges within the same qd .",
    "however , for @xmath31 with one electron in each qd in initial states , the theory predicts that @xmath25 and @xmath26 emission energies are blue and red shifted with respect to the corresponding @xmath30 levels .",
    "this is because of the participation of electrons inter - dot tunnel coupling in the final state@xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the experiment only a slight red shift of both lines is observed , similar to what is seen in vqdms pl when spectator electrons are placed in neighbor qds .",
    "this result lead us to suspect that the electron tunnel coupling in lqdm 1 may be suppressed for @xmath24 states .",
    "this suppression may be related to the different nature of repulsive coulomb interactions between electron - electron and hole - hole .",
    "the basin structure in between the qd pair could also influence the tunneling strength.@xcite the simulations also predict the inverted energy of @xmath27 and @xmath29 emissions as a result of the inter - dot tunneling of the electron in the final state @xcite .",
    "our experimental techniques do not allow us to confirm this assignment , but it seems consistent with the fact that former shows up at smaller bias than the latter in fig .",

    "as the applied voltage increases beyond v1 , second electron can tunnel into the lqdm .",
    "for lqdm 1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ lqdm1f](b ) , the confined conduction band energy levels of the two qds are similar in energy and it is energetically favorable for the second electron to go into the left qd .",
    "although the left qd energy state is at somewhat higher energy than the state of the right qd , this spatial configuration reduces the energy penalty of on - site electron - electron coulomb repulsion if both electrons are in the right qd . as a result of the electrical injection of a second electron , new pl lines appear for voltages above v2 .",

    "three lines and a hint of the fourth line are visible , corresponding to the combination of two initial states and two final states of @xmath35 emission .",
    "the small energy separation between each line suggests the perturbation from electron tunnel coupling and the auger process in between two neighbor qds . as the applied voltage increase beyond v4 , the ground state of the lqdm",

    "the observation of energy shifts computationally predicted to arise from electron tunneling provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of tunnel - coupling for @xmath6 ( and possibly @xmath31 ) in this system .",

    "in a nearly - degenerate lqdm , a single electron is able to tunnel between two neighboring qds when there is one hole in each qd . however , in a non - degenerate lqdm , electron tunneling is significantly suppressed and it is impossible for electrons in the right qd to recombine with the hole in the left qd .",

    "the presence of electrons in both qds makes it possible for the hole to relax into either qd .    at v3 , the electrical injection of the third electron causes a 0.8 mev red shift for the @xmath35 pl emission . again , a pl doublet is observed , corresponding to the relaxation of the hole into the left or right qd . the intensities of @xmath32 and @xmath35 pl lines are substantially reduced compared to @xmath24 pl lines .",
    "we observe significant variation between lqdms in the pl intensities of highly charged states .",
    "we tentatively assign this variation to changes in electron tunneling escape rates from higher energy states , but further work to analyze this effect is necessary .",
    "we analyze the pl emission of lqdms as they are controllably charged with electrons in a vertical electric field geometry .",
    "using laser intensity and electric field dependent measurements , along with an analysis of relaxation dynamics , we assign the observed pl emission to specific charge configurations .",
    "the observed energies are found to be in good quantitative agreement with calculations .",
    "the results reveal that changes in the relative energy of the two qds comprising the lqdm can have substantial impact on the resulting pl spectral maps .",
    "our investigation of an lqdm with nearly - degenerate energy levels , in conjunction with computational analysis , demonstrates the existence of inter - dot tunneling of electrons .",
    "for the non - degenerate lqdm , the evidence of inter - dot tunneling is not observed in zero lateral bias . future work will focus on applying lateral electric field to simultaneously control the degeneracy of lqdms .",
