    "it is generally accepted that the evolutionary status of young stellar objects ( ysos ) is characterised by the shape of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . during the early phases of star formation",
    "the emitted sed has the shape of a cold , few tens of k , blackbody modified by the emissivity of the dust .",
    "the central object , even when already formed , is not visible at any wavelength since the surrounding dust envelope completely obscures the inner region .",
    "as the evolution goes on , the optical depth of the dust decreases making the central object optically visible until its spectrum looks like that of a normal star with an infrared excess due to the residual circumstellar material .",
    "it is then clear that the characterisation of the evolutionary status of ysos is better done by observing the dust emission rather than the stellar radiation which is only visible during the late phases of star formation .",
    "iso , the infrared space observatory @xcite , has opened a new observing window covering the near to far infrared wavelengths up to @xmath3 m , where the dust emission peaks .",
    "it is then natural to use iso data to derive the evolutionary status of ysos . to this aim",
    "we introduce a two colour diagram defined between 60 and 170@xmath4 m which exploits almost all the spectral coverage of the long wavelength spectrometer , lws @xcite . already with iras data two colour diagrams",
    "have been used to infer the evolutionary phase of ysos , ( e.g. @xcite , or @xcite ) , however , the lws extends the fir ( far infrared ) spectral coverage of iras by a factor @xmath5 in the region where the peaks of emission of blackbodies with temperatures in the range @xmath6k fall , typical of ysos in the early phases of their evolution .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have indeed already shown that such a diagram allows to identify the evolutionary status of ysos .",
    "while in the previous work a small sample of objects was used , we have now completed the analysis of the whole sample of ysos observed by the lws as part of the core program dedicated to the study of the star formation .    with respect to previous evolutionary diagnostic tools , like the spectral index @xmath7 @xcite , the bolometric temperature ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 diagram @xcite",
    ", our method can be applied to ysos in all evolutionary phases ( class  0 , i and ii objects ) , and does not require the knowledge of either @xmath10 , or the complete sed .    in section  2 we present the sample , and the data analysis is briefly reported ; in section  3 the two colour diagram is shown and discussed ; the conclusions are summarised in section  4 .",
    "our sample consists of 61 ysos for which an lws full range grating spectrum , @xmath11 m with a resolution @xmath12 , was obtained .",
    "it corresponds to almost all the observations carried out with the lws as part of the iso - lws core programme on star formation , excluding a few sources whose spectra are too noisy to derive reliable photometric data .",
    "we have decided to include for this paper only the sample of our guaranteed time , to have a homogeneous set of data taken with the same observational procedure and comparable integration times .",
    "our original sample , to which the 61 objects discussed here belong , was selected on the basis of the knowledge of the instrument ( spatial and spectral resolution , sensitivity ) and on the spectral characteristics of the known sources , at the time of the definition of the observing programmes ( around 1995 ) .",
    "the raw data have been processed with version  8 of the off - line pipeline and analysed with the isap package . after removing bad points , the scans were averaged .",
    "the strong source correction , which takes into account the non - linearity of the detectors at high fluxes ( @xcite , @xcite ) , was applied to the data if it was necessary .",
    "the lws spectra are affected by instrumental effects ( fringes , memory effects , bad flat field and dark current removal , see @xcite ) which might potentially influence the shape of the spectrum .",
    "such effects can be , at least partially , corrected by using specific routines ( lia , the lws interactive analysis ) .",
    "however it has been verified @xcite that for the majority of our objects , the fluxes are not considerably changed by applying these routines . in the end , we adopted the fluxes computed without any correction .    for some objects , one or more off - source positions have been observed to estimate the background emission . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we compared the colours before and after removing the background and we found that , again in a statistical sense , the subtraction does not alter our results .",
    "moreover , in star forming regions the presence of a diffuse , not homogeneous , cloud emission makes it difficult to define the background level .",
    "in addition , when the instrument does not have enough spatial resolution , the confusion due to other sources in the beam can make even the meaning of background dubious . for these reasons we did not subtract the background from the on - source spectra .",
    "the large spread of the colours in our diagram is , likely , the consequence of this choice , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "the colour @xmath13 $ ] is defined as : @xmath14=\\log\\frac{f_j}{f_i}\\ ] ] @xmath15 being the flux densities in jy , averaged over a certain band , at the wavelengths @xmath16 . in the case of photometric data",
    "@xmath17 is the effective wavelength of the adopted band .",
    "dealing with spectra the choice of the wavelength is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "a natural choice is to measure the flux at @xmath18 m and @xmath19 m , which allows a comparison with iras data . as a third wavelength we adopted @xmath20 m",
    ": this choice was first motivated by the instrumental characteristics of the lws ( as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "it then turned out that these three wavelengths are close to the effective wavelengths of the broadband filters of pacs @xcite , a far infrared camera for imaging and spectroscopy which is part of the payload of the future esa cornerstone mission the herschel space observatory .",
    "in such a way it will be possible to use our two colour diagram with pacs data .    for the bandwidths",
    "there is no obvious choice . at first sight",
    "a good solution could be to simulate the spectral response of the iras bands , as the isap package allows .",
    "there are , however , at least two reasons for not following this approach .",
    "the first one is that this choice is not applicable to the third band since iras did not observe at @xmath20 m .",
    "secondly , future space missions will enlarge the number of known ysos , so it is important that our tool does not depend on the photometric bands adopted in previous observations .",
    "so , we simply averaged the spectra over 1@xmath4 m around the three wavelengths , and verified that our conclusion are not altered when data derived with a completely different instrument , in particular with iras , are used .",
    "this topic will be addressed in the next section .",
    "the uncertainty of the lws fluxes can be as low as 10% for on - axis , not too bright nor too faint , point sources .",
    "these conditions are seldom met for our sources , so we adopted a more conservative error of 30% , which turns into an error on each colour of 0.26 .",
    "in table  [ tab : table ] we report , for each object : its name ; the identifier in the iras point source catalogue , if present ; the lws and , if available , the iras colour @xmath21 $ ] ; the lws @xmath22 $ ] colour . the membership of each source to a class has been assessed by looking at the literature .    the [ 60100 ] vs. [ 100170 ] diagram is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . for comparison we reported the colours , computed following the same procedure outlined before , of a blackbody at various temperatures ( marked by crosses and connected by the solid line ) ranging from 25  k ( top right ) to 90  k ( bottom left ) .",
    "the fu orionis sources are reported in the figure but not considered in the following discussion since their colours are likely influenced by the outbursts of their disc which represent transient phenomena in the process of star formation .",
    "the sources do not strictly follow the blackbody line , but there is a clear trend of increasing colour temperature @xmath23 with the age of the sources : class 0 objects have @xmath24k , class i have @xmath25k and for class ii @xmath26k .",
    "bright class i show the highest temperatures with @xmath27k .",
    "this trend can be qualitatively explained by considering that at these wavelengths @xmath23 depends only on the temperature stratification of the circumstellar matter . in the first stage of the evolution",
    "we can see only the outer region of the envelope at cold temperatures .",
    "the optical depth of the envelope decreases with the age so that we can look deeper into the inner , and warmer , regions of the envelope and , consequently , @xmath23 increases .",
    "the remaining of this section is organised as follows : first we discuss separately each class and argue that the presence of outlyers , evident in the diagram , can be tentatively explained , in many cases , as due to background contamination .",
    "for such reason we can not average all the colours for each class because this procedure assumes that the dispersion of the points is caused only by random fluctuactions .",
    "instead , we preferred to compute the median which is less sensitive than the mean to the outlyers .",
    "then , in section  3.4 , we test our result with a different data set , using iras fluxes , to verify that we did not introduce any bias in the data analysis , at least for the @xmath21 $ ] colour .",
    "finally , the medians are reported in figure  [ fig2 ] along with their root mean square ( rms ) errors , and their position with respect to the blackbody colours is discussed in section  3.5",
    ".      class 0 sources appear well clustered in the upper right region of the diagram with @xmath21\\ga 0.45 $ ] and @xmath22\\ga 0.08 $ ] , except four objects discussed below .",
    "the median colours are : @xmath21=0.53\\pm 0.23 $ ] and @xmath22=0.19\\pm 0.18 $ ] .",
    "iras  181480440 ( number 7 in figure  [ fig1 ] ) has a smaller @xmath22 $ ] colour and falls closer to class  i sources .",
    "it is reported as a class  0 in the compilation by @xcite but @xcite argue that this source is already in a transition state between class  0 and i. from our diagram we suggest that iras  18148 would be better classified as class  i.    the two sources fir  3 and fir  5 in ngc  2024 ( numbers 2 and 3 in the figure ) have blue colours , similar to those of bright class  i ( @xmath28 ) . from the analysis of the same spectra used in our work , @xcite have shown that in ngc  2024 the emission lines are mainly produced by the extended cloud in which the sources are embedded .",
    "since the hii region associated with ngc  2024 has a luminosity of @xmath29 @xcite , while for fir  5 @xcite estimate @xmath30 , from the position of the sources in our diagram we suggest that the observed continua are dominated by the diffuse pdr more than by the objects themselves .",
    "the source iras 2 in ngc 1333 ( labelled 5 in the plot ) falls close to class  ii objects .",
    "the iras colour found by @xcite and reported in table  [ tab : table ] is redder than ours and puts the source closer to other class  0 .",
    "the fluxes were measured with the chopped photometric channel of iras which provided a higher angular resolution than that specific to the iras survey , but it is worth noting that the colour directly measured by iras is 0.35 , not very different from our value of 0.30 .",
    "it is then likely that the colour we found is strongly affected by the low spatial resolution of the lws rather than depending on intrinsic characteristics of the source .      without considering the two fu ori sources",
    ", we find for class  i objects the following median colours : @xmath21=0.280\\pm 0.075 $ ] and @xmath22=0.09\\pm 0.10 $ ] .",
    "the large scatter in the @xmath22 $ ] colour is due to the position of l  1206 ( source number 4 ) close to the class  ii objects , and to a little `` cluster '' of three sources with @xmath22>0.2 $ ] : for irs 43 and 44 ( numbers 12 and 11 in the figure ) the large @xmath22 $ ] colour is due to the diffuse emission in the @xmath31  oph complex in which they are embedded .",
    "in fact , the subtraction of the background moves their colours into the class  i region .",
    "objects having a total luminosity @xmath32 have been considered as a distinct group ( bright class  i ) , since such a high luminosity is usually associated with very massive hot young stars whose fir colours are expected to be different from those of lower luminosity class  i sources .",
    "in fact , with the exception of ngc  281w ( number 6 ) , they have @xmath33<0.2 $ ] and @xmath22<-0.1 $ ] , and fall close to the blackbody line with colour temperatures @xmath34k .",
    "the median colours are @xmath21=0.02\\pm 0.16 $ ] and @xmath22=-0.130\\pm 0.083 $ ] .",
    "the colours of ngc  281w , whose total luminosity is @xmath35 @xcite , are the reddest of this group and are in strong disagreement with those of the other objects .",
    "we do not have any explanation for such a position .",
    "this group is divided into low mass stars , @xmath36 , called t  tauri after their prototype , and intermediate mass stars , @xmath37 , called herbig ae / be stars ( or haebe ) .",
    "this division reflects physical and observational differences between them , but in our diagram they occupy the same region so , to increase the statistical significance of our work , we will discuss them together .",
    "all the class  ii objects , with the exception of mwc  297 , iras 13547 , t  cra and sr 9 , cluster in a well defined region of the plot .",
    "the median colours of all sources , except the fu ori , are @xmath21=0.11\\pm 0.14 $ ] and @xmath22=-0.03\\pm 0.12 $ ] , with a colour temperature @xmath26k .    for sr  9 ( number 10 in the figure )",
    "the fluxes in the on - source position are equal to those in two observed off - source positions so that we conclude that the continuum emission of this t  tauri star is completely dominated by the intense diffuse background of the @xmath31  oph region , in which sr  9 is embedded , with colours in agreement with those of class  0 sources ( see table  [ tab : table ] ) .",
    "its @xmath22 $ ] colour is similar to that of irs 43 and 44 which also lie in the same region ( see the previous discussion ) .",
    "the anomalous position of the haebe star mwc  297 , in the bottom left corner and labelled with 1 , is compatible with the finding of @xcite that it could be in a more evolved stage and already on the main sequence . in the opposite corner ,",
    "iras  13547 ( number 8) and t  cra ( 10 ) have colours compatible with class  0 sources : even if their membership to haebe is doubtful , the former being defined as `` potential candidate '' and the latter reported among `` other early type emission line stars with ir excess '' in the compilation of haebe by @xcite , these sources are optically visible and they can not belong to the group of class  0 .",
    "the only conclusion that we can draw from our diagram is that the fir emission is either produced by a diffuse background , for t  cra see the fir maps of @xcite , or by a close cold companion .",
    "as we already pointed out , it is important that the result of our work , i.e. that the @xmath21 $ ] vs. @xmath22 $ ] diagram is able to separate ysos belonging to different evolutionary stages , is independent of the instrument used and on the adopted photometric bands . further , since we neglected instrumental effects , did not take into account the background contamination , defined two colours chosing three arbitrary wavelengths and averaging the fluxes over three arbitrary bandwidths , the reader could wonder about the reproducibility of our finding with different instrument / sample / data analysis .    to address some of these points we compared the median of the @xmath21 $ ] colours we found , with the medians derived using the iras fluxes , when available in literature .",
    "these two sets of data have in common only the effective wavelengths : bandwidths and data acquisition / reduction are completely different . as in our original sample , we did not consider fu orionis objects .",
    "the two sets of medians are reported in table  [ comp ] .",
    "l.@@xmath38l.@@xmath38l + & & + class 0 & 0.53 & 0.23 & 0.53 & 0.16 + class  i & 0.280&0.075&0.385&0.078 + bright class  i&0.02 & 0.16 & 0.13 & 0.16 + class  ii & 0.11 & 0.14 & 0.12 & 0.20 +    for bright class  i the number of sources with iras data is too small to draw any conclusion . for class 0 and",
    "ii the agreement between the two sets of data is excellent . only for class",
    "i is the difference larger than 1 rms . from our point of view",
    ", however , the difference between 0.280 and 0.385 does not make a big difference in the conclusion that class  i sources occupy a specific region of the diagram .",
    "what this difference means is just that we can not specify with great accuracy what the median @xmath21 $ ] colour is .",
    "the median colours are reported in figure  [ fig2 ] . in this figure we also plotted , as in figure  [ fig1 ] , the colours of a single blackbody at different temperatures ( solid line ) . in order to clarify why the ysos have colours under this curve",
    "we also plotted the colours of a blackbody modified by an emissivity law @xmath39 which better approximates the emission properties of the dust , the main emitter in the fir .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the case @xmath40 , typical of interstellar dust , while the dotted line @xmath41 , is more representative of the dust in the star forming regions .",
    "it is clear from the figure , that no positive @xmath42 can account for the positions of the median values .",
    "another possible explanation is related to the confusion of the sources inside the lws beam .",
    "it is not possible to model this effect since we should know , object by object , the physical properties and the spatial distribution of the sources around the observed position .",
    "however , we can at least check if this hypothesis moves the colours in the region of the plot where their medians lie , by simply summing the fluxes of two blackbodies . in this case",
    "there are three free parameters : the two temperatures and the ratio of their radii . as an example",
    ", we have plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] , the dotted - dashed line , the colours obtained for the temperatures 25 and 90k , with a ratio varying from 0 to @xmath43 ( the cross symbol marks the case corresponding to the radius of the colder body 10 times larger than the radius of the warmer one ) . as can be seen the sum moves the colours in the wanted direction .",
    "the effects of a finite optical depth of the circumstellar envelope , while they can not be accounted for by a sum of blackbodies , should however be in qualitative agreement with the previous model , so that we can expect also for isolated objects a displacement from the blackbody colours as observed in our plot .",
    "the @xmath21 $ ] vs. @xmath22 $ ] two colour diagram has been presented for a sample of ysos observed with the lws instrument on - board iso .",
    "each class of ysos occupies different regions of the diagram with bluer colours corresponding to older classes .",
    "the median values of the colours are : +    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      + the relative position of the different classes is related to the physical properties of the circumstellar matter and is not an artefact of our data analysis .",
    "this has been tested , for the [ 60 - 100 ] colour , through a comparison with iras data which also show this segregation effect .",
    "it is not possible to make such test for the other colour .",
    "however it is very unlikely that the class separation is due to a bias either in the sample selection or in the data analysis .",
    "the change of the colours is a genuine evolutionary effect : in the younger objects we can only observe the outer , and colder , regions of the dusty envelope .",
    "the median colours are systematically under the curve of the blackbody colours , and the values we found are probably biased by the combination of both the background contamination and the confusion of the observed sources in the lws beam .",
    "the low spatial resolution of the instrument is indeed the main limitation of our result .    in this respect",
    "this work will be greatly improved by future space missions which will observe with a higher spatial resolution .",
    "for instance , the multiband photometric surveys of the fir camera pacs at @xmath4460 , 100 and 170@xmath4 m , will be able to make the census of each different evolutionary class of protostellar and pre - main sequence objects in the most important star forming molecular clouds .    in spite of the present limitation ,",
    "we conclude that this two colour diagram offers a powerful and simple tool for the evolutionary classification of ysos .",
    "the advantage over other methods is that follow up at other wavelengths to identify the evolutionary status will not be needed . as an example , even if we stress that with the lws data our diagram works mainly as a statistical tool , with only three fluxes , and no other photometric measurement , it is possible to assign the evolutionary class to the source iras 18148@xmath20440 : class  i , in agreement with @xcite , rather than class  0 source @xcite .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "the iso spectral analysis package ( isap ) is a joint development by the lws and sws instrument teams and data centres .",
    "contributing institutes are cesr , ias , ipac , mpe , ral and sron .",
