    "to model disease propagation , it is necessary to define the corresponding social network connecting any two individuals in the world .",
    "the expected properties of such a network should be both the clustering ( which excludes models of disorder like the random graphs @xcite ) , and to allow a connection between any two individuals within a finite number of steps ( which excludes the regular networks with only nearest neighbor connections ) . indeed , for the latter feature milgram showed in @xmath0 that the average number of steps connecting any two individuals is six ( called also six degrees of separation ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior led recently watts and strogatz to propose the model of small world network ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "they considered a low dimensional network with periodic boundary conditions for convenience ( a ring for example ) where they rewired some bonds with a probability @xmath2 to a new site randomly chosen from the network . for small values of @xmath2",
    "this still corresponds to a regular network but with few long range connections called short - cuts ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a more recent work on the @xmath1 was proposed by newman and watts @xcite where the number @xmath4  of nearest neighbors ( @xmath5 ) is conserved but instead of rewiring , they added an average density @xmath2 of new bonds from each site @xmath6 to other nodes randomly chosen ( except its nearest neighbors ) .",
    "a review of these models and their application to various fields and particularly epidemics can be found in the references @xcite . in these networks",
    "the percolation threshold was extensively investigated and its dependence to the @xmath5 and @xmath3 was found to satisfy the following equation @xcite @xmath7    this threshold corresponds in epidemics to the smallest concentration of susceptibles leading to the outbreak @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical behavior of percolative @xmath1 networks is different from that of regular systems @xcite . in particular , at the percolation threshold , there is no diverging cluster for the @xmath1 because a @xmath3 between the two ends of the system has a finite probability to occur for any non - vanishing number of these bonds . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic length scale in such networks ( which corresponds to the correlation length in regular lattices ) behaves as @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the euclidean dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "it is then obvious that this characteristic length does not diverge at the percolation threshold for such networks .",
    "therefore , a further investigation of the cluster statistics around this _ new _ percolation threshold for such networks and the phase transition seems to be necessary .",
    "let us now consider the application of this model to epidemics which seems to be one of its main aims . from the large amount of works using @xmath1 , there is no direct comparison with the existing data may be due to the complexity of the diseases features ( incubation and latent periods , birth and death rates etc . ) .",
    "furthermore , the parameters used ( mainly @xmath2 ) are very small and do not simulate the real connections between individuals .",
    "they use also commonly average values of the @xmath5 and the @xmath3 while these quantities strongly fluctuate in the real live ( the number of contacts , friends , family members etc . varies from @xmath10 to few tens ) which can influence sensitively the results on the density of susceptibles at the percolation threshold ( epidemic outbreak ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is impossible in practice to measure the density of susceptibles systematically ( it needs an extensive serological investigation in the epidemic phase ) .",
    "generally , for large population samples epidemiologists measure the evolution with time of the number of cases for a given disease .",
    "it is then necessary to study the dynamical behavior of the propagation of the disease and relate it to the density of susceptibles .",
    "there are only few works which examined ( only qualitatively ) the dynamical behavior of the disease on social networks @xcite .",
    "the aim of these works was to show how the density of infected behaves in the endemic and epidemic phases .    in this article",
    ", we use a site percolation on a @xmath1 with parameters ( @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) representing a sample of school age children to study the effect of the fluctuations of @xmath5 and @xmath3 on the percolation threshold .",
    "furthermore , in order to propose a formula for determining the serology of the sample from the rate of increase of the number of cases , we investigate also extensively the dynamical behavior of an infectious disease as well as its effect on the density of susceptibles below and above the percolation threshold .",
    "a new _ super - diffusion _ is found above the percolation threshold when the cluster is initially infected by one or a small number of infectious sites and its characteristic time dependence on the density of susceptibles is determined .",
    "we examined also the case where the infection probability of the @xmath5 is different from that of @xmath3 , showing a double diffusion with two characteristic times .",
    "in the next section we describe the model and then present the results on the statistics of the clusters and the percolation threshold .",
    "the results on the dynamical behavior of the disease are presented in section 4 .",
    "we consider the one dimensional @xmath1 described by newman and watts @xcite but @xmath2 represents the total number of @xmath3 generated for each site uniformly from all the other sites of the network . in the case",
    "where @xmath4 and @xmath2 are not fixed they are generated randomly within a normal distribution centered at their average values with fluctuations @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the coordination number is the total number of bonds to a given site ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we study in this network a site percolation problem @xcite by assuming each susceptible site @xmath14 ( occupied ) contracts the disease if it is connected with an ill site @xmath6 ( occupied also ) .",
    "the occupied sites ( susceptibles ) are randomly generated with a concentration @xmath15 while the empty sites correspond to refracted individuals . for @xmath4 and @xmath2",
    "fixed , the percolation threshold @xmath16 is related to @xmath17 and @xmath2 by eq.(1 ) @xcite .",
    "this threshold corresponds to a transition from the endemic phase below @xmath16 to the epidemic one above this point @xcite . in @xmath1 networks",
    ", @xmath16 is the minimum concentration of occupied sites above which the average largest cluster size @xmath18 of the occupied sites becomes power - law increasing with the concentration ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , while it diverges in a regular network @xcite ( note here that the exponent @xmath20 is positive ) . by analogy with the regular lattices @xcite",
    ", we will check the universality of the exponent @xmath20 .",
    "we are interested in the application of such a model to a childhood disease like measles . in such diseases epidemiological investigations on school age children can be easily controlled and provide data with a minimum bias .",
    "we choose parameter values corresponding to such a disease by taking @xmath21 to be the average number of brothers , sisters and neighbors , while @xmath22 represents the average number of children one can meet at the school .",
    "these parameters should correspond to a topology closer to that encountered in a real social network . regarding the dynamical study",
    ", we assume the major contribution to the epidemics provided by the largest cluster .",
    "we restrict ourselves then to this cluster and start the infection with one or few infectious sites at time @xmath10 .",
    "these sites will infect all the connected sites in the next step ( after a time @xmath23 ) , which themselves infect their connected sites after @xmath24 and so on .",
    "we assume the latent and incubation periods smaller than @xmath23 which is taken in the rest of this paper as a unit time .",
    "the number of infected sites in each step is averaged by varying the initial infectious site position through the whole cluster .",
    "in this section , we realize @xmath25 configurations of the network described in the previous section with a size fixed at @xmath26 sites . we examine the effects of @xmath2 and its fluctuations on the average cluster sizes , @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we investigate the cluster size distribution around @xmath16 in order to determine the main contribution to the propagation of the disease .    in figure 1a",
    "we show the variation of the cluster size with the concentration of occupied sites for three different cases : @xmath27 ( fixed values ) and for @xmath4 and @xmath2 randomly generated with a normal distribution centered at @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , with a fluctuation of @xmath28 et @xmath30 respectively .",
    "we see clearly from this figure that in all cases the cluster sizes vary as a power law of ( @xmath31 ) above @xmath16 . for fixed @xmath17 and @xmath2",
    "the value of @xmath32 is in a good agreement with the analytical predictions of newman et al .",
    "@xcite ( eq .",
    "however , in the case of fluctuations of @xmath4 and @xmath2 , this threshold decreases sensitively ( about @xmath33 in the case shown in fig.1a ) as the fluctuations increase .",
    "therefore , the average values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 are not sufficient to characterize an epidemic outbreak .",
    "the @xmath3 fluctuations @xmath12 decrease @xmath16 as a power law with an exponent @xmath34 ( as shown in figure 1b ) , indicating a sensitive participation of the larger values of @xmath2 to built the largest cluster .",
    "therefore , the percolation threshold behaves as @xmath35    from this behavior , we can estimate the percolation threshold in a real sample of school age children to be in the range @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "now let us restrict ourselves to the case of fixed @xmath21 and @xmath38 in order to examine the statistical behavior of the clusters around @xmath16 ( without loss of generality , these values are chosen only because @xmath16 is large enough to enable sufficient cluster statistics for such a sample size ) .",
    "we found that the cluster size fluctuations are maximum at this threshold ( see fig.2a ) implying a divergence of this quantity at @xmath16 which seems to be a signature of a phase transition .",
    "the cluster size distribution ( see figure 2b ) confirms this divergence since it decreases exponentially below @xmath16 while it is power - law decreasing at this threshold ( this power law behavior is in agreement with the results of castellano et al .",
    "@xcite on other systems ) .",
    "indeed , at @xmath16 this corresponds to a lvy distribution @xcite with an exponent of @xmath39 indicating the divergence of all its moments .",
    "we notice here that only the higher sizes ( rare events ) contribute to the outbreak at @xmath16 ( as expected in such distributions ) . above @xmath16",
    "the small size clusters are _ absorbed _ by the largest one and we have again an exponentially decreasing distribution for small clusters while there is only one very large cluster ( not shown in fig.2b ) .",
    "since the cluster size does not diverge at @xmath16 , it is obvious that @xmath20 is not universal ( because it is not a critical exponent ) , but it is interesting to know how it depends on @xmath2 in such lattices . in figure 2c , the exponent @xmath20 seems to vary only linearly for larger values of @xmath2 but with a very small slope ( about @xmath40 @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is difficult to predict its behavior for very small values of @xmath2 because in this case the network tends to a regular one and the cluster size becomes very large so that the sample sizes taken here do not allow us to measure this exponent accurately .",
    "however , even if the parameters chosen in this model are close to those of a real social network , it seems impossible for epidemiologists to check these results .",
    "indeed , as explained below , they can not measure the density of susceptibles , except if they investigate systematically the serology of a sufficiently large sample of school age children ( e.,e.g .",
    "for a city sample ) .",
    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath16 should be checked for measurable quantities . in the case of disease propagation , the time dependence of the number of cases can be directly measured by epidemiological techniques .",
    "we will investigate this dynamical behavior in the following section .",
    "in this section we restrict ourselves to the fixed values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively ) to simulate a sample of school age children . from the results of fig.2b",
    ", we assume that the main growing effect of the infection comes from the largest cluster and estimate the propagation time of the epidemics only from this cluster .",
    "we determine the evolution with time of the number of cases for both phases endemic ( @xmath42 ) and epidemic ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "as found in figure 2a the cluster size at @xmath16 strongly fluctuates and therefore , the time behavior of the number of cases also fluctuates .",
    "the variation of the number of cases with time is shown in figure 3a for three cases ( just below @xmath16 , at @xmath16 and above @xmath16 ) with only one initial infectious site . in both cases ,",
    "the number of cases increases up to a maximum and then decrease because the number of susceptibles decreases . in the endemic phase ,",
    "the number of connections between occupied sites in the cluster is mostly @xmath44 and does not allow a significant increase of the number of cases ( the behavior in this case is under estimated since all the clusters should contribute to this increase ) . for susceptible densities around @xmath16 this situation persists for a long time and the number of cases increases linearly with time showing a normal diffusion of the disease . in the epidemic phase",
    "the increase becomes exponential indicating a new kind of _ super - diffusion _",
    "@xcite of the disease , due mainly to the increasing number of connections in the cluster ( as shown in figure 3b ) .",
    "this exponential growth is also observed for @xmath45 models @xcite where the rate is proportional to the basic reproduction rate @xmath46 which correponds in our case to the average number of connections in the cluster .",
    "we have also performed a monte - carlo simulation to the measles propagation in a more realistic sample ( births , deaths , incubation and latent periods etc . ) where the average infections is @xmath28 for each infectious individual and found also an exponential growth of the infected cases @xcite .",
    "therefore , this exponential growth does not seem to depend on the topology of the sample but the rate is sensitive to the geometry of the network .",
    "note in the present work that in the case of more than one initial infectious site ( see figure 3c ) the exponential growth behavior does not change but the growing rate fluctuates due to the fluctuating number of connections .",
    "the average rate of the exponential growth @xmath47 ( corresponding to the characteristic time of the epidemics ) is shown in figure 4 to increases as @xmath48 above @xmath16 while the period of this epidemic behavior decreases . from this figure",
    "we can conclude that when the characteristic time decreases below @xmath49 ( or @xmath47 increases above @xmath50 ) , the epidemic behavior takes place .",
    "this behavior seems to have a direct application in epidemiology since it provides a method for the estimation of the serological situation ( density of susceptibles ) from the characteristic time which is easily measurable .",
    "therefore , this result stimulates a proposal for a serological examination for a given childhood disease in a sample of age school children , but during an epidemic period to compare a realistic behavior with that obtained in this paper .",
    "now let us examine the case of adding different infection probabilities to this system .",
    "we consider that a site @xmath6 infects another site @xmath14 with a probability @xmath51 if @xmath14 is a neighbor of @xmath6 and @xmath52 if it is a short cut .",
    "the motivation of this investigation is that a susceptible child has a different probability to be infected by his brothers ( or sisters ) than by the other children meeting him at the school .",
    "we see clearly a double diffusion behavior in figure 5 ( for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , where the number of infected starts growing exponentially up to the characteristic time ( @xmath55 ) , then it increases as a power law up to a new characteristic time from which it grows again exponentially with the same rate .",
    "the slow diffusion is due to the small contact probability for the neighbors ( @xmath53 ) and has been observed in other fields @xcite .",
    "this slow diffusion appears very short because the number of @xmath5 is very small ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate this double diffusion for larger @xmath4 ( which is the case of animal diseases ) .",
    "we have investigated in this article the statistics of the cluster sizes in a one dimensional @xmath1 by taking into account the @xmath5 and @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "we found that these fluctuations decrease @xmath16 as a power law with a small exponent leading to a new expression for the percolation threshold .",
    "we found also that cluster size fluctuations is the quantity governing the phase transition in such a network . on the other hand , in order to apply our results to the measured quantities in epidemiology , we have studied the dynamics of the disease propagation in such clusters .",
    "we found in epidemic phases a _ super - diffusive _ with an exponentially growing number of infected sites , while at @xmath16 this number increases as a power law .",
    "the growing characteristic time is larger than @xmath49 in the endemic situation and decreases linearly with @xmath48 in the epidemic phase .",
    "this result provides a way to estimate the density of susceptibles in the epidemic phase .",
    "we propose then a serological investigation in epidemic situations to check this behavior .",
    "finally , we examined the case where the infection probability is very small in the @xmath5 compared to the @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamical behavior of infected cases shows a double diffusion with two characteristic times , and a power - law increase ( deceleration ) between them .",
    "we think that this effect is useful for samples with large @xmath5 and shows a way to stop the propagation of the epidemic for other diseases .",
