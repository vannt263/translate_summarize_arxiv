    "using @xmath6 collision data the lhcb collaboration  @xcite has reported the discovery of two narrow states , observed in the @xmath7 spectrum , with masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these states are interpreted as the orbitally - excited @xmath10 and @xmath11 bottom baryon resonances , with spin ",
    "parity @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the limits on the natural widths of these states are @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "these results reported by the lhcb collaboration are in good agreement with an old prediction by capstick and isgur  @xcite .",
    "their relativistic quark model predicts @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the masses of the lightest orbitally - excited states .",
    "however , the same model yields a mass of the ground state @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) which is about @xmath20 smaller than the measured value  @xcite . at the same time",
    "some other existing quark - models predictions @xcite differ by few tenths of mev from the lhcb experimental ones .",
    "we adopt a different approach and describe these states as dynamically generated resonances obtained within a unitarized baryon - meson coupled - channel scheme .",
    "the unitarization in coupled - channels has proven to be very successful in describing some of the existing experimental data .",
    "thus , there have been different successful studies based on the chiral perturbation theory amplitudes for scattering of @xmath21 octet goldstone bosons off baryons of the @xmath22 nucleon octet in the charmless sector ( e.g.  @xcite ) . unitarized coupled - channel methods",
    "have been further extended to the baryon - meson sector with charm degrees of freedom in several ways . in some works ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite a bare baryon - meson interaction is used , saturated with the @xmath23-channel exchange of vector mesons between pseudoscalar mesons and baryons .",
    "some other works @xcite are based on the jlich meson - exchange model and those in @xcite make use of the hidden gauge formalism , and the same approach has been extended to the bottom sector in @xcite .",
    "an extended weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction implementing heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) is applied in @xcite for the charm sector , while in @xcite it was also used for bottom - flavored baryon states . in this talk , we review some of the results of @xcite .",
    "we use hadronic degrees of freedom in a unitarized baryon - meson coupled - channel calculation .",
    "we rely on a tree - level interaction that embodies the approximate pattern of chiral symmetry , when goldstone bosons are involved , and hqss when heavy hadrons are present .",
    "moreover , it enjoys spin - flavor symmetry in the light ( @xmath24 ) flavor sector @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach previously applied for charm systems in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we consider baryon resonances with one bottom quark ( @xmath25 ) , in particular @xmath5 states with strangeness , isospin and spin - parity @xmath26 quantum numbers , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath3 with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "baryon - meson pairs with the same @xmath32 quantum numbers span the coupled - channel space .",
    "we study @xmath33-wave tree - level amplitudes between two coupled channels @xmath34 , which are given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the system ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the c.m .",
    "energy and mass of the baryon in the channel @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 is the decay constant of the meson in the @xmath39-channel .",
    "the masses of the baryons and the mesons and the meson decay constants used in this work can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 come from the underlying spin - flavor extended wt structure of the couplings of our model @xcite .",
    "the various exact symmetries referred above ( chiral , spin - flavor and hqss ) apply only to the coefficients @xmath41 , while physical masses and decay meson constants are used throughout when solving the coupled - channel equations .",
    "further , we solve the bethe - salpeter equation in the complex plane , which provides the @xmath42-matrix as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix containing the two particle propagator for each channel .",
    "the two particle propagator diverges logarithmically , thus the loop is renormalized by a subtraction constant ( see @xcite for discussion about the use of this method ) such that @xmath45 . to fix the subtraction point @xmath46 we consider all sectors with a common @xmath47 and different @xmath48 and all the corresponding channels .",
    "then @xmath46 is taken as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the masses of the meson and the baryon producing the lowest threshold for a given @xmath47 sector .",
    "the dynamically - generated baryon resonances are obtained as poles of the scattering amplitudes in each of the @xmath32 sectors .",
    "the poles of the scattering amplitude on the first riemann sheet that appear on the real axis below the threshold are interpreted as bound states , and those found on the second riemann sheet below the real axis and above threshold are identified with resonances .",
    "the position @xmath52 of the pole on the complex energy plane    @xmath53 provides the mass ( @xmath54 ) and the width ( @xmath55 ) of the resonance , and the couplings to the different baryon - meson channels are obtained from the residues of the scattering amplitude around the pole .",
    "our model generates four @xmath5 resonances .",
    "three lowest lying @xmath5 states have masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "as one can expect , the situation in the @xmath59 channel keeps a close parallelism with that of the @xmath60 resonance in the charm sector  @xcite . for both heavy flavors",
    "the structure obtained mimics the well - known two - pole pattern of the @xmath61 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , we find that the state at @xmath62 strongly couples to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 channels , with a negligible @xmath65 coupling , while the @xmath66 mev state has a sizable coupling to this latter channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath13 state at @xmath58 is generated mainly by the ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "this state is the bottom counterpart of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 resonances .    in order to achieve a better agreement with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states reported by the lhcb collaboration ,",
    "we have slightly changed the value of the subtraction point in this sector , namely we have set the baryon - meson loop to be zero at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath71 given by @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "we find two poles above the @xmath74 threshold , with masses @xmath75 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath76 ( @xmath13 ) , which admit a natural identification with the two @xmath5 resonances observed in  @xcite .",
    "their masses lie below all two - body channels thresholds considered in our calculations .",
    "the lowest in mass @xmath12 @xmath5 resonance is located at 5797.6  mev , and decays radiatively to @xmath77 .",
    "the other spin-1/2 baryon resonance in this sector has a mass of @xmath78 , which is above the @xmath79 threshold , but with less than 0.5  mev width due to small coupling .",
    "we find that the states @xmath1 and @xmath80 are hqss partners .",
    "these two states would be part of a * @xmath81 * irreducible representation ( irrep ) of su(3 ) , embedded in a * 15 * irrep of su(6 ) ( this was checked using the adiabatic symmetry breaking described in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the light quark structure of these two states is the same , and the coupling of the @xmath82-quark spin with the spin of the light degrees of freedom yields @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath1 and @xmath80 states form an approximate degenerate doublet .",
    "as it was already mentioned in the introduction , different quark models @xcite have also conjectured the existence of one or more excited @xmath85 and @xmath86 states .",
    "the early work of capstick and isgur @xcite generated the first two excited @xmath85 and @xmath86 states with masses that are particularly in very good agreement with the ones observed by the lhcb collaboration , but the ground state @xmath87 mass in this scheme is below the experimental one .",
    "our model reproduces the experimental @xmath1 and @xmath2 with an alternative explanation of their nature as molecular states .      in this work we found three @xmath3 and one @xmath88 , which belong to the same su(3)@xmath4hqss multiplets of the @xmath5 and @xmath89 states introduced in the previous subsection . for the subtraction point in this sector",
    "we use @xmath90 . we find a @xmath91 spin-1/2 state , which does not have possible hadronic decays , and thus its main decay mode is @xmath92 .",
    "further we find @xmath93 @xmath12 and @xmath94 @xmath13 , both with negligible width , which lie above the @xmath95 threshold .",
    "the fourth resonance we find in this sector is @xmath96 with a small width of 0.3  mev and two possible strong decay modes @xmath95 and @xmath97 .",
    "we find that @xmath98 and @xmath91 belong to the same irreducible representation , and similarly the @xmath99 and @xmath96 states . also , the pair @xmath93 and @xmath100 , in the * 15 * irrep of su(6 ) , form the hqss doublet related by su(3 ) to the doublet formed by the @xmath101 and @xmath102 states .",
    "none of these beauty - flavored states have been seen experimentally yet .",
    "schemes based on quark models @xcite predict @xmath103 and @xmath104 states with similar masses to our estimates , though there exist some differences between the various predictions .",
    "we have analyzed odd - parity baryons with one bottom quark by means of a unitarized baryon - meson coupled - channel model which implements heavy - quark spin symmetry . in our model",
    "pseudoscalar and vector heavy mesons are treated on an equal footing .",
    "we rely on a relatively simple tree - level interaction already used in the charm sector @xcite .",
    "this interaction has the virtue of embodying the approximate patterns of chiral symmetry , when goldstone bosons are involved , and hqss when heavy hadrons are present .",
    "the experimental states @xmath10 and @xmath11 reported by the lhcb collaboration are obtained as dynamically generated baryon - meson molecular states . within our scheme ,",
    "these states are identified as hqss partners , which naturally explains their approximate mass degeneracy .",
    "other @xmath5 states coming from the same attractive su(6 ) @xmath4 hqss representations are also analyzed .",
    "mass and decay mode predictions are also obtained for @xmath103 and @xmath104 resonances , which belong to the same su(3 ) multiplets as the @xmath85 and @xmath86 states , and the related underlying symmetry structure is analyzed .",
