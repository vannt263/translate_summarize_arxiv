    "are very close in the two cases , yet the downstream region is thinner ( by @xmath212% ) in the focused configuration .",
    "this can be explained by the curvature of the laser - plasma interface [ fig .",
    "[ fig : nh50_a060](a ) ] , which allows the ions and electrons of the downstream to leak off the @xmath209 axis . to ensure a stable front shock over a duration @xmath213 , the laser spot size , @xmath214 , should be larger than @xmath215 , otherwise , the downstream will be significantly distorted by the gaussian piston , which may hamper the shock propagation . in the case of a @xmath216m - focal spot ,",
    "the shock should be stable up to @xmath217 .",
    "the drop in the downstream density observed at @xmath218 ( corresponding to effective interaction time of @xmath219 ) supports qualitatively this estimate .",
    "note that making use of a super - gaussian laser profile may yield a more stable shock front .",
    "in contrast to the currently explored experimental setup @xcite which requires @xmath220kj - class laser facilities , we have found that only @xmath221kj of intense - enough laser pulses should be able to drive weibel - mediated shocks , which confirms the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "their formation proceeds as follows .",
    "rapidly after the start of the irradiation , an electrostatic shock forms and propagates . at later times , because the hot electrons have typical energy comparable to that of the ions ( in the piston frame ) , they are able to trigger a strong magnetic turbulence in the shock front region . the critical role of the return - current electrons in driving the weibel - filamentation instability has been shown , making use of a multi - waterbag decomposition scheme . unlike the usual framework @xcite , the ion heating and isotropization result from an electron - driven instability ( rather than ion - driven ) , at least over the relatively short time - scales considered in our simulation . during shock propagation on longer time - scales ,",
    "the ions could play a significant role in triggering the upstream instability .",
    "we have also shown that shock formation is accessible to a broad enough focused laser wave .",
    "however , the shock is found to decay away over time scales @xmath222    several points have yet to be clarified to ensure the experimental feasibility of weibel - mediated laser - induced collisionless shocks .",
    "the influence of collisions , ionization , radiative losses as well as 3d effects could be important .",
    "one of the most critical issue is linked to the diagnostics of such experiments .",
    "a major drawback of such shocks is that they develop in dense plasmas over very short space ( @xmath223 m ) and time scales ( @xmath31fs ) , which greatly complicates their experimental characterization unless one disposes of an intense , short - duration x - ray probe as provided by a free - electron - laser @xcite .",
