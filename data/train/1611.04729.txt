    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are characterized by strong temporal flux variability , which can provide valuable information on the complex physical processes of accretion and plasma outflows of agns ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a number of studies have found that various types of agns , from seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) to quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and radio bright agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , show ubiquitous aperiodic variability across various wavebands .",
    "the temporal power spectra or periodograms ( see @xcite for an exhaustive review of time series analysis )  i.e. , the square moduli of the fourier transforms  of lightcurves have been employed to quantify the statistical properties of agn variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in many cases ,",
    "their power spectra globally follow power laws @xmath1 with @xmath4 , corresponding to _ _ red noise _ _ ; in astronomy however , `` red noise '' is conventionally used for any @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "we adopt the astronomical nomenclature in this paper . ]",
    "we note that , in time series theory , the term `` noise '' generically refers to random intrinsic variations in brightness ( i.e. , not to measurement errors or instrumental noise ) .",
    "even though the fact that agn lightcurves show red noise power spectra was discovered almost 40 years ago @xcite and many studies have confirmed since then that this is a generic property of agns , it is still unclear why different agns show different characteristic variability patterns .",
    "especially interesting have been sources that show a break in their power spectra , resulting in different slopes ( @xmath2 ) below and above a certain frequency ( the _ break frequency _ ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such behaviour is often seen in optical and/or x - ray variability of seyfert galaxies , quasars , and even galactic black holes ( gbhs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the break frequencies for both gbhs and agns show an anti - correlation with the black hole mass @xcite and are also related to the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the presence of break frequencies in the power spectra indicates that there is a characteristic timescale that governs the variability .",
    "candidate timescales are the light crossing timescale , the orbital timescale , the disk thermal timescale , and the disk viscous timescale ( see e.g. , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these timescales are functions of the size of emitting regions such as accretion disks and hot coronae .",
    "thus , it makes sense that they scale with the black hole mass because each length scale is proportional to the schwarzschild radius , though the actual underlying relations must involve geometry and other physical properties of the emitting system .",
    "compared to the optical / x - ray variability of agns , the understanding of radio variability of agns is poor .",
    "the variability mechanism of _ _ radio bright _ _ agns is quite different from that of radio faint , optical and/or x - ray bright agns .",
    "they emit strong non - thermal emission that is usually thought to originate from relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "characteristic variability patterns are seen , especially flares or outbursts in the lightcurves ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which have been associated with shocks in jets ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "blazars , a subset of agns that comprises most of the radio bright agns show violent flux variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this special property of blazars is arguably related to relativistic jets ( almost ) aligned with the line of sight ( e.g. , @xcite ) , implying that relativistic doppler boosting plays an important role .",
    "accordingly , a number of physical parameters and various mechanisms are involved in generating the complicated variability of radio bright agns at radio wavelengths .",
    "additional difficulties arise from limited sampling of lightcurves of agns and statistical analyses that do not consider the red - noise properties intrinsic to agn lightcurves .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , monte carlo simulations of red - noise lightcurves are essential to reveal the intrinsic statistical properties of agn lightcurves that are usually masked by uneven , finite sampling . despite the importance ( a ) of the effects of limited sampling or windowing ( e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite ) , which are often described as _ red - noise leak _ and _ aliasing _ , ( b ) of using goodness - of - fit tests correctly @xcite , and ( c ) of deriving the statistical significance of supposed quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) signals in red noise power spectra @xcite , multiple studies of agn radio variability focused on apparent characteristic variability timescales while using the incorrect assumption of constant ( as function of @xmath5 ) significance levels in power spectra , which is only valid when @xmath2 is close to 0 ( @xcite , but , see @xcite for recent progress ) . in line with this",
    ", the characteristic timescales derived from using structure functions ( sfs ; @xcite ) have been interpreted as physical variability timescales of agns @xcite . however , as argued by @xcite , this approach is probably misleading ; in their study , peaks or breaks appeared in the sfs for all their simulated lightcurves even though there was no intrinsic characteristic timescale .",
    "artificial signals appeared at timescales close to the length of the timeseries .",
    "the signals observed by @xcite typically correspond to timescales smaller than @xmath6 of the length of the timeseries , leaving the possibility that they are indeed physical .",
    "given the substantial uncertainties in previous timeseries studies , alternative ways to extract variability timescales from lightcurves or power spectra need to be explored .",

uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , also referred to as continuous time first - order autoregressive process , or a mixture of several ou processes have been suggested to model the observed lightcurves and power spectra of quasars at optical @xcite , of seyferts and a gbh at x - rays @xcite , and of blazars at @xmath76-rays @xcite .",
    "the ou process describes a time series as a superposition of exponentially decaying outbursts occuring at random times and with random amplitudes .",
    "a mixture of ou processes is a linear superposition of ou processes , which has been introduced for a better description of agn lightcurves .",
    "these models were motivated by the `` perturbation '' class of astrophysical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) which suggests that the propagation of random accretion rate perturbations through the accretion flow is responsible for the observed variability of agns and gbhs .",
    "one advantage of these models is that they fit models to lightcurves instead of power spectra , which significantly reduces windowing effects .",
    "another advantage is that they use maximum - likelihood or bayesian techniques to utilize all the information contained in the data .",
    "the tight correlation between timescales and black hole masses seen in @xcite suggests that those models accurately extract the relevant timescales from lightcurves .",
    "however , the emission mechanisms of radio bright and radio faint agns are different ; the former is dominated by synchrotron radiation from relativistic jets , while the latter is dominated by radiation from geometrically thin accretion disks and/or hot coronae .",
    "if the same model is applied to systems with different radiation mechanisms are involved , one needs to explain why and how they can share the same statistical properties ( this is partially discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we will see that almost all ( 39 out 43 ) of our sources do not show indications for a break frequency in their power spectra , which might indicate that they have very long characteristic timescales  if at all .",
    "thus , we make use of monte carlo simulations of red noise lightcurves instead of the ou process in this study , following up on our success in unveiling the intrinsic statistical properties of four radio bright agns @xcite .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sect2 ] , we describe our data and sample . in section  [ sect3 ] , we explain how we obtain the statistical properties of our sources and relate them with other physical parameters such as the accretion rate in section  [ sect4 ] . in section  [ sect5 ] ,",

    "we exploited the agn monitoring database of the 26-meter university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ; see @xcite for technical details ) for our study . for a statistical analysis we selected all lightcurves",

    "section  [ sect3 ] ) .",
    "the number of data points before binning and flagging was 448 on average .",
    "this criterion ensured that at least one data point is available every @xmath02 months on average .",
    "for many sources , only one or two of the three umrao bands ( 4.8 , 8 , and 14.5 ghz ) satisfied this criterion .",
    "our selection left us with a sample of 43 sources ( 20 sources were available at 4.8 ghz , 38 at 8 ghz , 36 at 14.5 ghz ) .",

    "we binned our lightcurves in time to reduce any bias from uneven sampling and flagged outliers that were obvious at visual inspection .",
    "we used a bin size of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the total observing time and @xmath81 is the number of data points .",
    "binning of lightcurves can change the form of the corresponding power spectra because binning removes power at frequencies higher than the frequency at which binning is performed ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , this effect does not affect our results since the highest sampling frequency in the power spectra , @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is the number of data points after binning ) is always smaller than @xmath82 ( @xmath85 in our case ) .",
    "accordingly , our approach does not reduce the power at high sampling frequencies but reduces the maximum sampling frequency .",
    "the fraction of flagged data is less than 1% in most cases , and flagging does not alter the results significantly .",
    "we employed the normalized scargle periodogram for obtaining power spectra from unevenly sampled lightcurves @xcite .",
    "we used the fast algorithm devised by @xcite for computing periodograms .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of red - noise lightcurves using the algorithm of @xcite as we did already in @xcite .",
    "we summarize the main steps of the simulation process below .",
    "+    _ simulated power spectra . _",
    "artificial lightcurves can be computed by simulating complex spectra using the algorithm of @xcite and fourier transforming these spectra .",
    "we began with artificial lightcurves that covered a tenfold longer timeline than the observed ones and cut out segments of appropriate length ; this procedure reproduces the effects of red - noise leak @xcite . even after binning , the observed",
    "lightcurves still show gaps , and thus suffer from uneven sampling , because data gaps can be much longer than the length of one bin .",
    "therefore , we mapped the sampling pattern of the observed lightcurves into the simulated ones to take the effects of aliasing into account .",
    "we noted the importance of this process already in @xcite .",
    "we added gaussian noise to each lightcurve ; for each data point , we used the observational measurement error , multiplied by the ratio of the standard deviations of the simulated and the observed lightcurves .",
    "we note that our simulation process does not use interpolation of data .    _ model fitting .",
    "_ for any given lightcurve , we simulated 5000 power spectra for a range of @xmath2 from 1 to 3 ( from 1 to 4 for 0316 + 413 ) in steps of 0.1 . at this stage , using a weighted least - squares ` goodness - of - fit ' test is not possible because red - noise power spectra follow a non - gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , we binned both the observed and the simulated power spectra logarithmically by a factor of 1.6 in frequency , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we include at least two data points into each bin . to obtain the best - fit models of the observed power spectra , we calculated the standard goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath86 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_{\\overline{\\log p_s(f_i ) } } } ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the @xmath88th value of the binned logarithmic periodogram of the observed lightcurve , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the average and the variance of the power spectra of the simulated lightcurves , respectively .",
    "theoretically , covariance of power spectrum bins should be taken into account in addition to the variance . in principle , the spectral power at different bins is uncorrelated when using the sampling frequencies prescribed for a scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "actually however , the observed power spectra are affected by a convolution of the true spectra with a bias function , the ` fejer kernel ' @xcite , which comes from complex red - noise leak and aliasing and introduces correlations between the spectral power values at different sampling frequencies . in our work",
    ", this effect is already accounted for in our monte - carlo simulations  which justifies using the variance instead of the full variance - covariance matrix .",
    "we determined the @xmath2 value ( @xmath91 ) for which @xmath92 is minimized ( @xmath93 ) and obtained the errors of @xmath91 from the boundaries of the interval in @xmath2 where @xmath92 becomes @xmath94 .",
    "since our simulation is limited to a resolution of 0.1 in @xmath2 , we added an additional binning error of 0.05 in squares .",
    "we note that @xcite obtained the best - fit model power spectra of their _ monitor of all sky x - ray image _ ( maxi ) lightcurves of mrk 421 using this method .",
    "we illustrate the typical behavior of @xmath95 as function of @xmath2 for three sources in figure  [ chi ] ; these three sources are representative of sources showing fast , moderate , and slow flux variability , respectively .",

    "_ we determined a @xmath96 ( 99.7% ) significance level for each sampling frequency from the set of 5000 simulated periodograms with @xmath91 as we did in @xcite .",
    "a spectral power that exceeds the significance level at a certain sampling frequency might indicate the presence of a ( quasi-)periodic signal . in figure  [ pd ] , we show the observed power spectra , the expected distributions resulting from averaging over 5000 simulated power spectra with @xmath91 , and the significance levels of the three sources presented in figure  [ chi ] .",
    "the variability of a lightcurve can also be quantified via its fractal dimension ( see e.g. , @xcite for an exhaustive review ) .",
    "basically , this quantity describes how much a given plane  flux density vs. time in our case  is filled by the graph of a given function .",
    "if small ( large ) scale fluctuations dominate , corresponding to smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath2 in periodograms , the lightcurve fills a larger ( smaller ) fraction of the flux  time plane .",
    "the fractal dimension has been used to estimate the strength of spatial clustering of gas or stars and the effects of projection onto the sky plane ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we specifically used the box - counting dimension defined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of cells of ( dimensionless ) size @xmath99 occupied by the lightcurve . in practice , @xmath99 is limited by the sampling of the lightcurve . for each lightcurve ,",
    "we normalized the time axis to the interval from 0 to 1 and the flux density to zero mean and unity standard deviation .",
    "we divided the normalized time axis into @xmath100 sections with binsize @xmath99 and the normalized flux axis into @xmath100 sections of size @xmath101 ( because the flux densities happen to lie in the range of @xmath102 to @xmath103 for all lightcurves ) . in figure",
    "[ fig_fractal ] , we show the normalized lightcurves and corresponding filled grid cells for the three sources presented in figure  [ chi ] .",
    "radio lightcurves of radio bright agns ( mostly blazars ) are characterized by multiple flaring events .",
    "many studies have described flares either as exponentially rising and decaying ( e.g. , @xcite ) or gaussian ( e.g. , @xcite ) outbursts of radiation . as already noted by @xcite , the decomposition ( or deconvolution ) of lightcurves into several flares ( specifically , the one - dimensional clean method ) do not work well at observing frequencies below 22 ghz where the overlap of individual flares is very strong because of the rather long evolutionary timescales of the outbursts .",
    "thus , we divided the lightcurves of our sources into several pieces by visual inspection and fitted a single gaussian function to each piece .",
    "we note that this process is different from the aforementioned deconvolution because we only analysed discrete ( non - overlapping ) segments of the lightcurves . in this case",
    ", the _ amplitude _ of the model flares can be substantially overestimated .",
    "however , our primary aim is to obtain the _ duration _ of the flares , for which our procedure is sufficient . in figure",

    "this result indicates that such patterns are introduced by the sampling of the lightcurves , not by source - intrinsic variability .",
    "accordingly , interpreting any local peak in a power spectrum as an indication for quasi - periodic oscillations requires careful modelling of the power spectrum in order to prevent false positives .",

    "we find a strong anti - correlation with correlation coefficients ( pearson and spearman rank ) around @xmath135 .",
    "at least qualitatively , this seems rather obvious because a larger fractal dimension means that a light curve fills more grid cells .",
    "this in turn implies a more strongly fluctuating lightcurve which comes with a smaller value of @xmath2 . even though , we present here for the first time the quantitative relation between @xmath2 and @xmath134 , @xmath136 this relation holds over a wide range of @xmath2 values from @xmath01 to @xmath03 within errors with no notable dependency on observing frequency .",

    "this result implies that the longer the overall duration of the flares of radio bright agns , the steeper the power spectra .",
    "technically , such behavior is straightforward to understand : if a source shows flares with long duration , its lightcurve is dominated by long - term variability , which leads to steeper power spectra . however , the duration of flares is arguably related to fundamental physical processes in the agn ( like shocks in jets ) , and thus to various physical parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in turn",
    ", this indicates that @xmath2 can be used to derive some physical parameters of agns ( to be specified below ) .",
    "else than agn variability at high observing frequencies ( especially x - rays ) , radio variability has not received much attention because of the difficulties in quantifying the properties of the variability .",
    "the power spectra of agns at radio wavelengths usually show featureless simple power - law noise as seen in figure  [ pd ] but no characteristic break frequencies as found in x - rays . from the relation between @xmath2 and the median duration of flares , we conclude that the slope of the power spectra represents the variability timescales of radio bright agns .",
    "this implies that measurements of @xmath2 are able to reveal the complex accretion and jet physics of agns .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ deconv ] shows that the data points at large @xmath132 tend to lie above the best fit line .",
    "this is mainly because the number of flares becomes very small ( three to five ) for sources with large flare durations , thus making the use of the median problematic .",
    "in addition , the approach used in section  [ ssect_fit ] makes a strong assumption , namely that all lightcurves can be described as sequences of flares with gaussian profiles  an assumption that may or may not be generally valid .    in order to arrive at a more robust estimate , we focus on the parameter @xmath109 , the width of the distribution of the derivatives of a lightcurve obtained in section  [ ssect_der ] , instead of @xmath132 in the following .",
    "the parameter @xmath109 is inversely proportional to the effective variability timescale of a given lightcurve .",
    "it uses all data in a lightcurve , making its use statistically more rigorous than using the median duration of flares .",
    "in addition , the ( statistical ) errors of @xmath109 are known .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ deconv ] , @xmath138 and @xmath139 indeed show a strong anti - correlation .",
    "the scatter around the best - fit line in that figure and the fact that the two quantities do not show a one - to - one relation demonstrate the limited accuracy of the median duration of flares as a proxy for an effective variability timescale . indeed",
    ", @xmath109 does contain information on flaring activity , especially the duration of flares : if the variability is dominated by flares with longer duration , this will lead to smaller @xmath109 regardless of our choice of models for fitting the lightcurves ( compare figure  [ fig_fit ] and  [ diff ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath138 .",
    "a linear regression returns @xmath140 ( see the left panel of figure  [ b_diff ] ) .",
    "we employed the fitexy estimator @xcite for a linear fit to data with errors on both axes .",
    "we checked whether the observed relation between @xmath2 and @xmath141 also appears in simulated data using red - noise only lightcurves .",
    "we generated 100 artificial lightcurves using the method of @xcite with @xmath2 ranging from 1 to 2.8 .",
    "the simulated lightcurves were sampled at equal intervals .",
    "we added gaussian noise amounting to 2% of the standard deviation of a given lightcurve to take the effect of measurement noise into consideration .",
    "we obtained @xmath109 from the distribution of the derivatives of the normalized simulated lightcurves as we did for the observed lightcurves .",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath142 for the simulated data is shown in the right panel of figure  [ b_diff ] .",
    "overall , the data points are described well by a power - law function , the slope is ( within @xmath1432@xmath104 ) consistent with the observed one .",
    "we note that the value of the constant term is arbitrary because the unit of time is arbitrary .",
    "the consistency between observed and simulated @xmath144 relations indicates that the observed relation is actually a generic feature of red noise lightcurves .",
    "one might ask if this conclusion is consistent with the presence of distinct flares in the radio lightcurves of agns  flares are deterministic , whereas red - noise time series are stochastic by nature . when a flare begins , the flux density increases during the compton and synchrotron stages ( see e.g. , @xcite ) but decays eventually .",
    "accordingly , we have to conclude that the aperiodic occurrence of flares makes an agn lightcurve a red - noise time series .",
    "the duration of flares changes with time and flares occur at random times , leading to frequent superposition of flares ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig_fit ] ) .",
    "this behaviour might originate from underlying physical processes such as a long - term , red - noise like variability of accretion rate and/or particle injection rate into jets that is physically correlated over a time comparable to the observation period . in this case",
    ", we expect to find power spectra with a single slope over a large range of sampling frequencies .",
    "however , as we will see below , a few sources show a flattening of their power spectra at low sampling frequencies ; this implies that the timescales over which an emission process is correlated can be shorter than the observation period , roughly on the order of the typical duration of flares .",
    "we will discuss the possible origin of featureless red - noise power spectra in more detail in section  [ ssect_br ] .",
    "the reason why different radio bright agns show different variability patterns , specifically different @xmath2 , is not well - studied . in the case of radio - quiet , optical / x - ray bright agns and gbhs",
    ", a well - known scaling relation between the timescales that correspond to the break frequencies in their power spectra and the black hole mass indicates that their variability timescales are determined by the size of the emitting region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this size would be proportional to the schwarzschild radius which in turn scales linearly with the black hole mass .",
    "however , it is not clear if a similar scaling relation also holds for radio bright agns .",
    "radio bright agns emit their flux from relativistic jets instead of accretion disks , and emit synchrotron radiation instead of thermal radiation .",
    "therefore , one first needs to find a physical mechanism that determines the duration of radio flares .",
    "as noted in section  [ ssect_fit ] , our lightcurves can be described as sequences of gaussian  and thus symmetric in time  flux peaks .",
    "time - symmetric flares from blazars have been observed at multiple observing frequencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite for radio , @xcite for optical and @xmath76-ray , and @xcite for @xmath76-ray observations ) .",
    "the symmetry in time has been interpreted as the result of rise and decay timescales being determined by the crossing time of radiation ( or particles ) through the emission region .",
    "@xcite showed that the radiative cooling time is shorter than the cooling timescale of adiabatic expansion for almost all jet components in their vlbi blazar sample .",
    "therefore , one may expect the duration of flares to be given by the sizes of emission regions .    in most cases , radio flares of agns",
    "are associated with the inner regions of jets ( often identified with compact vlbi cores ) . especially , there is growing evidence for interaction of moving jets with ( probably ) stationary cores , leading to strong flares at high energies ( from optical to @xmath76-rays ) and , likewise , at cm / mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the cm / mm flares show much broader flare widths and time delays relative to the high energy flares , likely due to relatively long cooling timescales and high optical depths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the core is a conical , standing shock ( commonly assumed to be a recollimation shock , see e.g. , @xcite ) , then the duration of flares would be determined by the crossing time of jet material through the shock .",
    "the core might actually consist of multiple stationary shocks ; stationary knots in addition to the cores have been discovered by vlbi for many , usually nearby , sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this scenario , higher rates of matter injection into agn jets would lead to longer flare durations , or variability timescales , if the particle densities and bulk velocities of inner jets are similar across our sample .",
    "these assumptions are supported by observations of the particle densities in the jets of several blazars @xcite and the fact that the location of standing shocks is expected to be at the end of the acceleration and collimation zone of the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of matter injection into the jet , @xmath145 , would ( largely ) determine variability timescales in radio bright agns . in a given time interval",
    "an agn with higher @xmath145 would show , say , one major flare while those with smaller @xmath145 would show multiple minor flares .",
    "recent theoretical studies actually show that the rate of electron injection into jets can play an important role in determining the slope of power spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the jet power @xmath146 and the accretion power of blazars of the form @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the accretion rate .",
    "the jet power @xmath146 is given by the kinetic energy per time , i.e. , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the lorentz factor . since",
    "our sources are luminous blazars and usually show superluminal proper motions , their lorentz factors are located in a rather narrow range ( cf .",
    "thus , we have @xmath151 .",
    "evidence for the proportionality between @xmath145 and @xmath148 has been provided by @xcite who discovered that significant dips in the x - ray light curves of the radio galaxies 3c 111 and 3c 120 are followed by ejections of new superluminal jet components .",
    "this indicates that x - ray emitting matter in hot coronae and/or the innermost accretion disks is ejected in a jet outflows . combining the various arguments",
    ", we examined if radio bright agns indeed show a scaling relation between the variability timescales and the accretion rates .    when comparing the observed variability timescales with other parameters we need to correct for the effects of doppler boosting .",
    "the observed variability timescale is decreased relative to the intrinsic one , @xmath152 , by the doppler factor @xmath153 , where @xmath150 is the lorentz factor , @xmath2 is the jet speed in units of speed of light , and @xmath154 is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight . if cosmological redshift is non - negligible , the total doppler factor is @xmath155 .",
    "if we assume that the variability timescales of our sources scale with the accretion rate to a power @xmath156 , i.e. , @xmath157 , then we find from the relation @xmath158 ( see section  [ ssect_bt ] ) @xmath159    the doppler factor is difficult to measure directly because the two parameters involved , intrinsic jet speed and viewing angle , are hard to disentangle in many cases .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite obtained the doppler factors of many of our sources .",
    "they decomposed their lightcurves obtained at 22 and 37 ghz into exponentially rising and decaying flares .",
    "they assumed that the brightness temperature derived from the flux variability differs from the radiating particle ",
    "magnetic field energy equipartition temperature by the doppler factor ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite obtained the doppler factors for some of our sources assuming that the observed variability timescales differ from the light crossing time across the emitting region because of doppler boosting affecting observed jet components . for 1101 + 384 and 1652 + 398 ,",
    "we took the values from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we note that the doppler factor of 1101 + 384 measured by @xcite is somewhat different from that of @xcite .",
    "however , we adopted the argument of the former that different doppler factors for radio and high energy photons are necessary for this source .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite who obtained @xmath160 for 1652 + 398 , depending on their models for the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "this result is consistent with that of @xcite and we adopted their value , @xmath161 .",
    "we note , however , that this value could be biased because it was derived from modelling the spectral energy distribution of higher energy photons , which might originate from a different emission region . in total",
    ", we were able to retrieve the doppler factors for 39 out of 43 sources ; the values are shown in table  [ information ] .",
    "where doppler factors from both @xcite and @xcite were available , we first took the average of all values of the latter because they provided individual doppler factors for each jet component of a given source .",
    "then , we took the average of the doppler factor of @xcite and the averaged one of @xcite .",
    "we used the standard deviation of the logarithms of the doppler factors of @xcite as the error of @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath163 , for each source .",
    "variations in the values for different jet components might originate from intrinsic variability of the doppler factors and/or measurement errors . for some sources , only the values of @xcite were available ; in those cases , we assigned the average @xmath163 from sources for which we could actually estimate the error ( @xmath164 dex ) as `` typical '' error .",
    "we note that this value is consistent with an independent estimate of the mean uncertainty of variability doppler factors , which is @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "the disk luminosity , in units of eddington luminosity , is an indicator of accretion rate because the normalized accretion rate is given by @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the radiative efficiency of accretion .",
    "according to the standard , geometrically thin accretion disk theory @xcite , @xmath167 depends on the location of the innermost stable orbit of the disk and thus on the spin of the black hole .",
    "@xcite showed that jet launching and acceleration must be extremely efficient for blazars to explain the excess of jet power over accretion power .",
    "this requires almost maximally rotating black holes ( see also e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our sources likely have @xmath167 values close to the limiting case @xmath168 chosen by @xcite . in summary",
    ", we compared the intrinsic variability timescales ( doppler - corrected ) with the accretion power , @xmath169 , where the accretion rate is derived from the disk luminosity assuming @xmath170 , in the left panel of figure  [ fig_bh ] .",
    "we note that we rearranged equation  [ eq5 ] in order to avoid displaying large errors along one axis .    despite some scatter , we find a strong correlation .",
    "we note that the correlation coefficients become significantly larger when we exclude the fsrq 1928 + 738 from the calculation which is arguably an outlier .",
    "we suspect that the doppler factor of this source is systematically underestimated ( @xmath171 ) , even though it shows quite fast superluminal motion with a maximum jet speed of 8.16 times the speed of light without showing any indication of counter jet emission @xcite . the spearman rank correlation coefficient  which is less sensitive to outliers  shows that the positive correlation between @xmath172 and @xmath173 is statistically significant , with the false alarm probability @xmath174 being about 0.01% .",
    "we performed a linear regression using the errors on both axes with the fitexy estimator ( section  [ ssect_bt ] ) and obtained a slope of @xmath175 .",
    "this value translates into @xmath176 according to equation  [ eq5 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath177 is close to one , especially when ( the value given in the bracket ) 1928 + 738 is excluded ; this indicates a good agreement of model and data over five orders of magnitude in accretion power . in the right panel of figure  [ fig_bh ] , we binned the data in the left panel logarithmically in accretion power with a binsize of 0.5 dex and the best fit line from the un - binned data is shown together .",
    "we investigated possible differences in the scaling relation for the two classes of radio bright agns , i.e. , blos and fsrqs .",
    "we divided our sources into those with disk luminosities above and those with disk luminosities below 1% of the eddington luminosity , which corresponds to fsrqs and blos , respectively .",
    "this approach is based on @xcite who showed that using the ratio of disk or blr luminosity and eddington luminosity is more adequate to distinguish fsrqs and blos compared to the classical one using the equivalent width of emission lines .",
    "the value of @xmath178 is known to divide different accretion regimes of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the same parameter can also be used to distinguish fr 1 and fr 2 radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we counted fr i galaxies , in our case 3c 84 , as blos and the fr ii galaxy 3c 111 and 3c 120 as fsrq ( see table  [ table_bh ] ) .",
    "this is in accord with , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who suggested that fr i and fr ii radio galaxies are the parent populations of blos and fsrqs respectively .",
    "however , as seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig_bh ] , we do not see any indication of difference in the scaling relation between different classes of radio bright agns , although the small number of blos and the fact that all blos in our sample are among the most radio - loud objects prevent us from drawing strong conclusions .",
    "the fact that all our sources share the same scaling relation regardless of their source types implies that the variability timescales of radio bright agns are determined by a relatively simple physical process  only weakly ( if at all ) dependent on jet powers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , radiative cooling mechanisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and possible differences in the geometry of magnetic field lines pervading in jets ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the clear relation between variability timescales of agns at radio wavelengths and accretion rates measured at optical wavelengths comes as a surprise : this behavior indicates that the radio variability of radio - bright agns is governed by the accretion process .",
    "however , the rather shallow ( @xmath179 ) slope in the scaling relation is hard to explain in the frame of a simple conical jet scenario .",
    "if ( a ) flares arise when a conical jet flow passes through a standing shock and ( b ) jet opening angles do not vary substantially among different agns , one arrives at a simple relation between the accretion rate and the length of the jet along the jet direction , @xmath180 , namely : @xmath181 . here",
    "@xmath108 is a rest - frame time interval ( which is different from the observer frame interval by a factor @xmath182 ) and @xmath183 is the mass density of the jet . if the jet is in a steady state , we can expect @xmath184 which leads to a linear proportionality between @xmath148 and @xmath180  thus the intrinsic variability timescale is proportional to the accretion rate .",
    "however , the slope we find , 0.25 , is quite different from the one expected from this simple scenario .",
    "this might be the result of complicated jet geometries , such as localized emission regions ( often referred to as `` blobs '' ) , or quasi - spherical emission regions , which have succeeded in explaining the broadband variable emission of blazar jets ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", one would expect a proportionality @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the size of the blobs , if ( a ) there is no density gradient in the blobs and ( b ) the density does not vary substantially from source to source .",
    "in addition , recollimation of jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , strong superposition of multiple flares arise in different shock regions and possible time delays at cm wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and shock - shock interactions in jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) might play an important role . the possible effect of superposition of multiple flares might be investigated by using high - frequency data ( mm / sub - mm wavelengths ) .",
    "in addition , dedicated numerical simulations would be helpful to investigate the complicated coupling behavior between mass accretion rate and jet structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    as illustrated in figure  [ fig_bh2 ] , we checked if the intrinsic variability timescale is related to eddington ratio and black hole mass . in the left panel ,",
    "the scaling with black hole mass shows a large scatter , with correlation coefficients of @xmath187 , indicating a moderate correlation .",
    "this correlation is probably a consequence of the correlation seen in figure  [ fig_bh ] because ( i ) all the fsrqs ( except the outlier 1928 + 738 ) follow the relation with @xmath188 due to their eddington ratio being concentrated around @xmath189 ( see figure  [ fig_mdot ] ) and ( ii ) the blos lie systematically below the fsrqs with similar black hole masses , which indicates their low accretion rates lead to low variability timescales . in the right panel , we see a correlation of time scale and eddington ratio with correlation coefficients as high as 0.7 when excluding 1928 + 738 .",
    "this , too , is probably a corollary of the @xmath2@xmath148 relation because our sources span only @xmath190 dex in black hole mass ( as can be seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig_bh ] ) and more than four orders of magnitude in accretion rate .",
    "a simple power - law model explains the observed power spectra of most of our sources successfully without any indication for statistically significant qpo signals . however , there are four sources out of which each shows significant excess spectral power simultaneously at two or three observing frequencies and at similar sampling frequencies : 0235 + 164 , 0430 + 052 , 1156 + 295 , and 2251 + 158 .",
    "this excess power might indicate the presence of qpos .",
    "we show the power spectra , the best - fit power - law models , and the corresponding @xmath96 significance levels in figure  [ fig_qpo ] .    actually , the candidate qpo signals are located at rather low sampling frequencies and the power spectra appear to flatten below those frequencies . thus , we tested if the periodograms can be ( or have to be ) modeled as broken power - laws with break frequencies @xmath191 .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations as we did in section  [ ssect_lc ] but this time with broken power - law models .",
    "we assumed that @xmath2 becomes zero below the break frequency .",
    "we computed sets of models with break frequencies ranging from @xmath00.05 to @xmath00.7  yr@xmath110 and power - law indices @xmath2 ( above the break frequencies ) ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 .",
    "we obtained 1000 artificial lightcurves for each combination of @xmath191 and @xmath2 .",
    "after mapping the observed sampling pattern into the artificial lightcurves , we obtained the binned logarithmic power spectra and took the average of them for each bin .",
    "then , we calculated @xmath92 using equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "we show the @xmath92 contours for 0235 + 164 at 8.0 ghz ",
    "@xmath192 , corresponding to 68% , 90% , and 99% significance levels , respectively ",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) , as function of @xmath2 and @xmath191 in figure  [ fig_2dchi ] .",
    "we obtained the values and the unmarginalized @xmath193 errors of the best - fit @xmath2 and @xmath191 .",
    "the best - fit broken power - law periodograms for the four sources in question are shown in figure  [ fig_bp ] . within errors ,",
    "the periodograms are completely described by the models .",
    "we note that the @xmath194 values are reduced significantly when changing from simple to broken power - law models : from 3.03 , 1.44 , 2.21 , and 2.51 to 0.77 , 0.48 , 0.69 , and 1.22 for 0235 + 164 , 0430 + 052 , 1156 + 295 , and 2251 + 158 , respectively .",
    "we note that the best - fit values for @xmath2 in the broken power - law models tend to be very high , up to the simulation limit of 4.0 .",
    "the formal errors of these values are large , ranging from 0.3 to about 1.2  meaning that @xmath2 is not well constrained .",
    "thus , using the broken power - law results for other analyses , e.g. , the scaling relations of variability timescale with black hole mass , would lead to highly uncertain results .",
    "we suspect that our assumption of flat power spectra below the break frequencies results in the high power spectral indices we observe .",
    "our primary interest was to investigate whether there is indication for broken power - law periodograms at least for a few sources . for most of our targets , the two models ",
    "simple vs. broken power - law  are not distinguishable within errors .",
    "therefore , we stick to the best - fit values of @xmath2 obtained with the simple power - law models throughout this paper .    as noted already in section  [ ssect_bt ] , the origin of the featureless red - noise power spectra of agn ( mostly blazars ) radio lightcurves is not understood .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of broken power - law periodograms typically seen in the x - ray and optical lightcurves of non - blazars ( i.e. , seyferts and quasars ) .",
    "one possibility is that the emission is correlated over very long timescales ",
    "comparable to the observation time covered by umrao database , @xmath195 years .",
    "if the radio emission of agns is directly linked to the accretion flows , the spatial correlation of accretion flows ( see e.g. , @xcite ) for radio - bright agns is much stronger than for nonblazars .",
    "however , many of our sources , especially the fsrqs , are active at optical bands as well ; they should have accretion disks which are similar to x - ray / optical bright nonblazars .",
    "an alternative scenario involves the special feature of blazars lightcurves : the flares . even if the power spectra of accretion flows or matter injection flows into jets have break frequencies at relatively high sampling frequencies , the break frequencies can move toward low sampling frequencies if the duration of the flares is long enough to cause substantial overlap of individual emission events .",
    "such overlap effectively increases the timescales for flux variations , resulting in higher spectral power at lower sampling frequencies .",
    "the location of the break frequencies would depend on the degree of superposition .    to test this scenario , we employed a simple simulation of lightcurves .",
    "we generated 100 artificial lightcurves @xmath196 , each composed of multiple exponential flares , according to @xmath197 , \\quad \\rm{for\\ t < t_0\\ and } \\\\ & = f_{\\rm max}\\exp[-(t - t_0)/t_d ] , \\quad \\rm{for\\ t > t_0 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is the peak amplitude of the flare , @xmath199 is the time , @xmath200 is the time of the peak , and @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the rise and decay timescales , respectively @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that agn radio lightcurves can indeed be decomposed into exponential flux peaks whenever the overlap between flares is not too strong ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for each lightcurve",
    ", we initially generated 20 flares that span 20 units ( that can be identified with years ) in time .",
    "from this , we took the half of the data points located in the middle of each lightcurves to avoid having lightcurves that converge to zero at the beginning and at the end . as a result",
    ", we have 10 artificial flares that span 10 units on average for each lightcurve . for each flare",
    ", we used @xmath198 uniformly randomly distributed from 0.5 to 1.5 units to randomize the amplitudes of flares , @xmath200 from @xmath203 to @xmath204 units for the @xmath100th flare to make aperiodic variability , and @xmath205 from 0.5 to 1.5 , multiplied by a characteristic timescale @xmath206 .",
    "this timescale controls the degree of overlap of flares .",
    "we varied @xmath206 from @xmath207 to @xmath208 units and obtained the average of the periodograms for each @xmath206 value . this averaged periodogram we fitted with a broken power - law model with three parameters : the power - law index @xmath2 above the break frequency @xmath191 ( the slope below @xmath191 being zero ) , and a constant offset for taking into account aliasing .",
    "one realization of a lightcurve , the corresponding power spectrum , the averaged power spectrum , and the best - fit broken power - law model for each of three different values of @xmath206 are shown in figure  [ fig_shot ] .",
    "when @xmath206 is small compared to the average separation between two flares ( i.e. , one unit ) there is almost no overlap between flares ; the break frequency appears at sampling frequencies well above one frequency unit .",
    "as @xmath206 increases , it becomes more difficult to disentangle individual flares and the break frequency moves toward lower sampling frequencies  as expected .",
    "we obtained the break frequencies of the simulated power spectra as function of @xmath209 .",
    "we found a power - law relation , @xmath210 .",
    "we scaled the errors on @xmath191 such that @xmath211 for the best - fit model .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_break ] , the break frequency decreases with increasing @xmath209 and , at @xmath212 , converges to a value located close to the lowest sampling frequency .",
    "accordingly , periodograms from lightcurves that show extensive overlap of flares appear as simple power - laws  as is indeed the case for most of our target agns .",
    "it is now possible to check the degree of agreement between the observed break frequencies as function @xmath209 and the simulation results . on the one hand ,",
    "the break frequencies found in 0430 + 052 and 2251 + 158 are very small , @xmath00.2yr@xmath110 , meaning that a wide range of @xmath209 is consistent with the observed value for @xmath191 ( see also figures [ fig_qpo ] and [ fig_bp ] ) . 0235 + 164 and 1156 + 295 , on the other hand , show relatively large break frequencies , @xmath00.5yr@xmath110 and @xmath00.4yr@xmath110 , respectively .",
    "we took the median duration and the median separation of the flares we obtained in section  [ ssect_fit ] ( for each source and each observing frequency ) and calculated the observational values for @xmath209 .",
    "since we used gaussian flares in our lightcurve fitting but exponential flares in the simulations , we multiplied the observed @xmath209 by @xmath213 to compare the _ e_-folding timescales of observed and simulated flares ; these values are denoted @xmath214 in table  [ table_shot ] .",
    "we inserted the observed break frequencies into the theoretical @xmath191@xmath215 power - law relation and obtained the theoretical ratio @xmath216 .",
    "the difference between @xmath217 and @xmath216 is on the order of 10% typically and reaches 31% at most ( see table  [ table_shot ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observation of red - noise periodograms for most of our target sources is consistent with being due to strong temporal overlap of flares . the main reason for this might be the relatively long variability timescales of agns at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "we show the lightcurves of 0235 + 164 , for which the break in the periodogram is quite prominent , in figure  [ fig_0235 ] .",
    "the duration of the individual flares is short compared to their typical separation ; indeed , it seems that there is no substantial overlap between the flares  which is consistent with our scenario .",

    "@xcite concluded that the slope of x - ray periodograms ( below the high - frequency break ) of 10 seyfert galaxies does not correlate with black hole mass .",
    "this indicates that , for seyferts , factors such as the amplitude of the driving noise field are more important than black hole mass in determining the structure of flux variability . the noise field is arguably related to the viscous , thermal , and radiative response of accretion disks to perturbations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , radio variability of agns is governed by the crossing time of radiation and/or disturbances through the emission region .",
    "this also explains the quite low break frequencies observed in agn radio periodograms . in optical and x - ray power spectra of nonblazars , break frequencies are found at timescales of less than a few years @xcite .",
    "blazars usually show symmetric flares across multiple wavelengths  see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for 22 and 37 ghz data respectively , @xcite for optical and @xmath76-rays , and @xcite for @xmath76-rays . as the observing frequency increases ,",
    "the rise and decay times of flares become shorter ( e.g. , @xcite ) due to the shorter cooling times of higher energy particles ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", we may expect ( 1 ) smaller power spectral indices @xmath2 and ( 2 ) observations of broken power - law periodograms at higher frequencies .",
    "@xcite showed that the power spectra of six radio bright agns at millimeter wavelengths have @xmath218 , which is much smaller than the values we find in this work .",
    "however , windowing effects ( especially red - noise leak and aliasing ) were not taken into consideration then , making it hard to conclude on the general behavior of mm - radio periodograms .",
    "several recent studies concluded that the power spectra of many radio bright agns are quite steep ( @xmath219 ) at 15 ghz ( from the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) 40 m monitoring program ; @xcite ) as well as at 37 ghz ( from the metshovi agn monitoring program ; @xcite ) .",
    "this behaviour differs from our expectation in that ( i ) the ovro result seems to disagree with our result even though the observing frequency is very similar and ( ii ) the 37 ghz power spectra appear to be steeper than ours even though the observing frequency is higher .",
    "we present a comparison in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "although the errors of @xcite are too large for a quantitative one - to - one comparison , the average @xmath2 from the ovro observations ( weighted mean @xmath220 ) seem to be larger than that from the metshovi observations ( @xmath221 ) , which is in agreement with our expectation .",
    "however , the systematic difference between these studies and our work ( @xmath222 ) needs to be investigated .",
    "there are important differences in the methodology for estimating @xmath2 between the various works .",
    "the ovro and metshovi studies employed linear interpolation of lightcurves ( whenever there is a gap in the data ) after binning and convolved the resulting lightcurves with a hanning sampling window function , which reduces red - noise leak @xcite .",
    "interpolation leads to a suppression of power at high sampling frequencies because it correlates adjacent data points , thus resulting in an artificial steepening of power spectra .",
    "our work did not use interpolation of data .",
    "we employed the scargle periodogram which can be applied to unevenly sampled lightcurves @xcite . in case of uneven sampling ,",
    "the periodogram suffers from red noise leak and aliasing , leading to characteristic distortions as shown in @xcite . however , our simulated power spectra are distorted in the same way because we mapped the sampling patterns of the observed lightcurves into the simulated ones ( cf . ,",
    "figure  [ ex ] and the bottom right panel of figure  [ pd ] ) .",
    "we also note that uncertainties in the _ absolute _ values of @xmath2 do not affect our results , as long as the _ relative _",
    "( i.e. , source - to - source ) differences in @xmath2 are preserved  as demonstrated by the correlation between @xmath2 and fractal dimension of a lightcurve ( figure  [ fig_tfrac ] ) .",
    "a more detailed dedicated investigation will be necessary in the future for making an informed choice from among the various approaches .",
    "in the @xmath76 ray regime , @xcite found periodogram slopes of @xmath223 and @xmath224 averaged over nine fsrqs and six blos , respectively .",
    "these values are compatible to the values which we find in this work , whereas we would actually expect smaller values of @xmath2 in the high - energy regime .",
    "we note however that averaging power spectra of different sources is likely to lead to spurious results  as noted in section  [ ssect_beta ] , even for sources of the same agn type @xmath2 covers a wide range of values ( from @xmath01 to @xmath03 ) .",

    "lightcurves than those used in @xcite ( 4 years vs. 11 months ) and modeled them in the time domain based on the assumption of a mixed ou process . for their sample of 13 blazars",
    ", they obtained @xmath225 .",
    "they also found low - frequency breaks for two sources , 3c  66a and pks  2155 .",
    "@xcite found slopes around 0.85 for the hard x - ray lightcurves of three blazars and a broken power - law periodogram for 3c 273 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the above results are in agreement with our scenario of @xmath2 becoming smaller , and broken power - law periodograms becoming more prominent , at higher observing frequencies .",
    "contrary to this trend , @xcite found slopes up to 2.3 for a few blazars at optical wavelengths .",
    "we also note that , when comparing radio , optical , and high - energy emission , we are looking at radiation from different physical emission mechanisms and/or different emission regions .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the variability of blazars at optical and @xmath76 ray wavelengths is correlated , while the presence of a correlation between radio and optical bands is unclear .",
    "accordingly , a comparison of radio and optical lightcurves may be of questionable value , while a comparison between optical and x - rays/@xmath76-ray lightcurves is more straightforward .",
    "we studied long - term ( 2532 years ) , high - quality radio lightcurves of 43 radio bright agns  27 fsrqs , 13 blos , and 3 radio galaxies  at 4.8 , 8 , and 14.5ghz .",

    "the power spectra of 39 out of 43 sources are in agreement with simple power - law periodograms without any indication for ( quasi-)periodic signals .",
    "power spectral indices range from @xmath01 to @xmath03 .",
    "we find a strong anti - correlation between the power spectral index and the fractal dimension of the lightcurves , thus quantifying the one - to - one relation between the geometry of lightcurves and the slopes of periodograms as @xmath226 , where @xmath2 is the power spectral index and @xmath134 is the fractal dimension .",

    "1156 + 295 , and 2251 + 158  we find that broken power - law models provide significantly better fits to the observed periodograms than simple power - law models . from random realizations of lightcurves composed of sequences of exponential flares ,",
    "we obtain a theoretical power - law relation between break frequency @xmath191 and scaled duration of flares @xmath215 .",
    "we find that , within errors , our observed values for @xmath191 and @xmath215 agree with the theoretical relation .",
    "we conclude that the periodograms of agn lightcurves follow broken power - laws intrinsically .",
    "the strong overlap of subsequent flares in cm - radio lightcurves leads to correlation of the observed flux over long timescales and thus to red - noise power spectra ( simple power - law periodograms ) .",

    "<S> the power spectra of 39 ( out of 43 ) sources are in good agreement with the models , yielding a range in power spectral index ( @xmath2 ) from @xmath01 to @xmath03 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit a gaussian function to each flare in a given lightcurve to obtain the flare duration . </S>",
    "<S> we discover a correlation between @xmath2 and the median duration of the flares . </S>",
    "<S> we use the derivative of a lightcurve to obtain a characteristic variability timescale which does not depend on the assumed functional form of the flares , incomplete fitting , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , once the effects of relativistic doppler boosting are corrected for , the variability timescales of our sources are proportional to the accretion rate to the power of @xmath3 over five orders of magnitude in accretion rate , regardless of source type . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that modelling the periodograms of four of our sources requires the assumption of broken powerlaw spectra . from simulating lightcurves as superpositions of exponential flares </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that strong overlap of flares leads to featureless simple power - law periodograms of agns at radio wavelengths in most cases . </S>"
