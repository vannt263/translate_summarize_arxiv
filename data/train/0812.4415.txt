    "the objective of the na61/shine ion program is to search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter and to study the properties of the onset of deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "this goal will be pursued by an experimental investigation of nucleus - nucleus , proton - proton and proton - lead integrations at at the cern sps .",
    "na61/shine intends to carry out  for the first time in the history of nucleus - nucleus collisions  a comprehensive scan in two dimensional parameter space : the size of the colliding nuclei versus the interaction energy  @xcite . the project has the potential for an important discovery  the experimental observation of the critical point of strongly interacting matter . on top of",
    "that it guarantees precision measurements crucial for the understanding of the properties of the onset of deconfinement .",
    "the synergy of the na61/shine physics program  @xcite on physics of strongly interacting matter with cosmic - ray and neutrino programs , as well as the use of the existing accelerator chain and detectors offers the unique opportunity to reach the physics goals in an efficient and cost effective way .",
    "na61/shine plans to perform the necessary measurements using the upgraded na49 apparatus  @xcite .",
    "the most essential upgrades are the increase of data taking and event rate by a factor of 10 and the construction of a projectile spectator detector which will improve the accuracy of determination of the number of projectile spectators by a factor of about 20 .    the na49 apparatus at the cern  sps served during the last 10 years as a very reliable , large acceptance hadron spectrometer and delivered experimental data of high precision over the full range of sps beams ( from proton to lead )  @xcite and energies ( from 20@xmath35  gev to 158@xmath35  gev )  @xcite .",
    "among the most important results from this study is the observation  @xcite of narrow structures in the energy dependence of hadron production in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "these structures are found at the low cern sps energies ( 30@xmath3580@xmath35  gev ) and they are consistent with the predictions  @xcite for the onset of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the questions raised by this observation serve as an important motivation for new measurements with nuclear beams proposed in the sps energy range at the cern  sps and also envisaged at bnl  rhic  @xcite , fair  sis-300  @xcite as well as nica  mpd  @xcite .",
    "these programs are to a large extent complementary .",
    "however , specific questions addressed in the na61/shine proposal can be best studied by na61/shine at the cern sps .",
    "[ na61-setup ]    the na61/shine experiment uses a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern - sps for the study of the hadronic final states produced in interactions of various beam particles ( @xmath36 , p , c , s and in ) with a variety of fixed targets at the sps energies .",
    "the layout of the na61/shine set - up is shown in fig .",
    "[ na61-setup ] .",
    "the main components of the current detector were constructed and used by the na49 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the main tracking devices are four large volume time projection chambers ( tpcs in fig .  [ na61-setup ] ) , which are capable of detecting up to 70% of all charged particles created in the studied reactions . two of them , the vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , are located in the magnetic field of two super - conducting dipole magnets ( maximum bending power of 9  tm ) and two others ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically with respect to the beam line .",
    "one additional small tpc , the so - called gap tpc ( gtpc ) , is installed on the beam axis between the vertex tpcs .",
    "the setup is supplemented by time of flight detector arrays two of which ( tof - l / r ) were inherited from na49 and can provide a time measurement resolution of @xmath37  ps .    in a 2007 pilot run",
    "data for the t2k neutrino experiment on p+c interactions at 31  gev / c were recorded  @xcite . for this run a new forward time of flight detector ( tof - f )",
    "was constructed in order to extend in these low - multiplicity events the acceptance for pion and kaon identification to low momenta ( @xmath38  gev / c ) .",
    "the tof - f wall is installed downstream of tpc - l and mtpc - r ( see fig .  [ na61-setup ] ) , closing the gap between the tof - r and tof - l walls .",
    "furthermore , one super - module of the projectile spectator detector ( psd ) was installed downstream of tof - f and tested  @xcite .",
    "the required energy resolution @xmath39 was reached .",
    "a major step forward in the detector performance , i.e. the tpc readout and daq upgrade , was achieved for the 2008 run . during the run",
    "the upgrade was tested .",
    "it results in an increase of the data rate by a factor of about 10 compared to the na49 rate .",
    "the 2008 run was cut short due to the lhc incident .",
    "compatibility with the i - lhc schedule requires the use of _ secondary _ ion beams for the na61/shine ion program .",
    "feasibility studies are in progress and first results indicate that the secondary ion beam properties are sufficient to reach the physics goals of na61/shine .",
    "the na61/shine data taking plan is presented in table  [ beam2 ] .",
    "the data taking program starts with @xmath40 and @xmath41 beams for the t2k and cosmic ray experiments .",
    "three energy scans with the secondary ion beams are planned with nuclei of mass numbers of @xmath42 10 , 30 and 100 . in addition , energy scans of p+p and p+pb collisions will be performed .",

    "[ comp ]    the exciting and rich physics which can be studied in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the cern sps energies motivates groups from bnl , jinr and fair to propose experimental studies which will complement the cern sps program .",
    "two fixed target programs ( cern sps  @xcite and fair sis-300  @xcite ) and two programs with ion colliders ( bnl rhic  @xcite and jinr nica  @xcite ) are foreseen .",
    "the basic parameters of the future programs are summarized in fig .",
    "the sps and rhic energy range covers energies from below up to well above the energy of the onset of deconfinement ( @xmath4430@xmath35  gev in the fixed target mode ) .",
    "thus these machines are well suited for the study of the properties of the onset of deconfinement and the search for the critical point .",
    "the top energies of nica and sis-300 are just above the energy of the onset of deconfinement .",
    "the physics at these machines will thus focus on the study of the properties of dense confined matter close to the transition to the qgp .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phase_acc ] which shows the coverage of the new programs in the baryon chemical potential together with the existing data and physics benchmarks in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "* measurements of identified hadron spectra in a broad rapidity range , which in particular , allow to obtain the mean hadron multiplicities in full phase - space , * measurements of the total number of the projectile spectator nucleons including free nucleons and nucleons in nuclear fragments , * high event rate in the full sps energy range including the lowest energies , * high flexibility in selecting the nuclear mass number ( thanks to the secondary ion beam option ) and energy ( thanks to the sps features ) of the projectile ions .",
    "the importance of the physics questions addressed by the sps and rhic programs requires two independent , partly complementary measurements .",
    "thus , both planned experimental programs should be performed .",
