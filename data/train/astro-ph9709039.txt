    "a number of astronomical objects ( extragalactic radio sources , supernova remnants , solar flares ) emit radiation with non - thermal spectra .",
    "these emissions are often connected with the existence of a hot turbulent magnetized plasma providing conditions for particle acceleration by mhd turbulence .",
    "it was first shown by hall & sturrock ( 1967 ) and by kulsrud & ferrari ( 1971 ) that charged particles can be accelerated by mhd turbulence having wavelengths long compared to the particle gyration radius .",
    "for example , the importance of a fermi - like acceleration mechanism was considered for extragalactic radio sources ( burn 1975 ; de young 1976 ; blandford & rees 1978 ; achterberg 1979 ; eilek 1979 ) .",
    "stochastic acceleration by plasma turbulence is often suggested as the acceleration mechanism for energetic particles during impulsive solar flares ( see , e.g. miller & ramaty 1987 ; steincker & miller 1992 ; hamilton & petrosian 1992 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that weak ( @xmath2 ) mhd waves can simultaneously energize ions by cascading shear alfvn waves ( miller & roberts 1995 ; miller & reames 1996 ) as well as electrons by the accompanying cascading fast - mode waves through a process known as a transit - time acceleration ( miller et al .",
    "the mhd waves are attractive candidates because they can be produced by either large - scale restructuring of the magnetic field , which presumably occurs during the flare energy release phase , or by a shear in the plasma bulk velocity ( roberts et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is likely to be found in regions of reconnection - driven plasma outflows ( see , e.g. , larosa & moore 1993 , forbes 1996 ) .",
    "the interaction between the waves and particles is determined primarily by delta functions , @xmath3 , which select those waves from a spectrum which are resonant with a given particle . at such interactions",
    "energies vary in a diffusive way , and over a long timescale a net energy gain results in the process of stochastic acceleration . for @xmath4 ,",
    "a particle resonates with those waves that are seen at an integral multiple of a gyrofrequency and for @xmath5 at zero frequency .",
    "then , a particle feels a net force which is not averaged out by the phase mixing ( stix 1962 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath5 provides magnetic analogy to landau damping and is associated with a first - order change in @xmath6 .",
    "this type of coupling is not observed in the case of alfvn waves but becomes important for the magnetosonic waves containing compressive components of @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction between the particle magnetic momentum and the parallel gradient of the magnetic field is called transit - time damping ( cf . discussions by lee & vlk 1975 , achterberg 1981 , miller et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "recently , schlickeiser & miller ( 1998 ) presented a quasi - linear derivation of cosmic ray transport coefficients in the presence of mhd waves , including isotropic fast - mode turbulence .",
    "for the isotropic kolmogorov turbulence they demonstrated that the fokker - planck coefficients depend both on the transit - time damping and the gyro - resonance interactions . for cosmic ray particles with @xmath8 and for vanishing turbulence cross helicity the momentum diffusion coefficient in the fast - mode turbulence",
    "is mainly determined by the transit - time damping contribution , leading to a more efficient stochastic acceleration in comparison to the process in the presence of pure alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath1 in the presence of finite amplitude ( @xmath9 , here we denote @xmath10 ) magnetosonic and alfvn waves .",
    "the influence of wave anisotropy and of the wave spectrum slope on @xmath1 is considered . in the next section",
    "we discuss the conditions essential for fast - mode wave damping in the plasma .",
    "we show that the low-@xmath0 plasma can provide conditions with the main damping process being the cosmic ray particles acceleration .",
    "then , in section  3 , we summarize the results of quasi - linear analytic derivations of the momentum diffusion coefficient to provide a reference for our numerical modelling .",
    "the performed monte carlo simulations involving derivations of particles trajectories in the space filled with finite amplitude fast - mode and alfvn waves are described in section  4 .",
    "anisotropic wave distributions are modeled by choosing their wave vectors from cones directed along the mean magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "for our simulations we adopt fast - mode or alfvn mode turbulence with the flat- ( @xmath12 ) or the kolmogorov ( @xmath13 ) spectrum within the finite wave vector range ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  5 .",
    "we confirm a substantial increase of @xmath1 for the fast - mode waves in comparison to the alfvn waves of the same amplitude if the nearly perpendicular ( @xmath16 ) waves are present .",
    "fast mode waves can effectively accelerate  particles , if other dissipation processes are negligible small .",
    "we will demonstrate here that in gases with low plasma - beta , @xmath18 , this requirement is fulfilled .    the equilibrium intensity of plasma waves results from the competition of wave generation and wave damping processes .",
    "the kinetic equation for a 3-dimensional spectral density @xmath19 , which denotes the wave energy density per unit volume of wavenumber space of the wave mode @xmath20 , is given by the usual conservation equation    @xmath21    where the flux    @xmath22    is expressed as a diffusive term with the diffusion coefficient in wavenumber space    @xmath23    and the spectral energy transfer time scale @xmath24 .",
    "this approach , to describe the evolution of turbulence by a diffusion of energy in wavenumber space , was pioneered by leith ( 1967 ) in hydrodynamics , and subsequently introduced to magnetohydrodynamics by zhou & matthaeus ( 1990 ) .",
    "it provides a simple framework to take into account - at least approximately - turbulence evolution in space physics applications .",
    "zhou & matthaeus ( 1990 ) present a general transport equation for the wave spectral density in the case of isotropic turbulence , which includes terms for spatial convection and propagation , nonlinear transfer of energy across the wavenumber spectrum , and a source and sink of wave energy .    for isotropic turbulence one obtains for the associated one - dimensional spectral density @xmath25 the simplified diffusion equation    @xmath26 - \\ ; \\gamma _ iw_i+\\ ; s_i(k)\\quad , \\eqno ( 2.4)\\ ] ]    where we included terms for the damping or growth of waves ( @xmath27 ) and a wave energy injection and/or sink term @xmath28",
    ".    the spectral energy transfer time scale ( or the wavenumber diffusion coefficient ( 2.3 ) ) depends upon the cascade phenomenology . in the kolmogorov treatment the spectral energy transfer time at a particular wavelength @xmath29 is the eddy turnover time @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the velocity fluctuation due to the wave . in the so - called kraichnan treatment",
    "the transfer time is longer by a factor @xmath32 .",
    "both phenomenologies are further discussed in zhou & matthaeus ( 1990 ) and yield    @xmath33    where @xmath34 denotes the energy density of the ordered magnetic field . substituting these transfer time scales into eq . ( 2.4 ) , and assuming a steady state with no damping , we obtain @xmath35 , where @xmath13 for the kolmogorov case and @xmath36 for the kraichnan phenomenology .",
    "the diffusion equation ( 2.4 ) in either case is nonlinear .    besides the generation of turbulence by kinetic cosmic ray streaming instabilities ( e.g. tademaru 1969 ) , wave cascading from low to high wavenumbers is very often an important way of producing broadband wave spectra .",
    "one possibility , discussed e.g. in the context of solar flares ( miller & roberts 1995 ) , is that long - wavelength turbulence results from the rearrangement of large - scale magnetic fields and/or a shear flow instability , so that it is reasonable to assume the deposition of wave energy peaked at long wavelength , probably comparable to the physical size of the system , as the primary energy release . cascading as described by the nonlinear diffusion term in eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) will then transfer this spectral energy to higher wavenumbers , where the waves will be able to resonate with progressively lower energy  particles , until they eventually interact with the charged particles in the tail of the background thermal distribution .    according to ginzburg ( 1970 ) the damping rate of fast magnetosonic waves propagating at an angle @xmath37 with respect to the ordered magnetic field in a thermal electron - proton background plasma",
    "is given by    @xmath38    where    @xmath39 \\eqno ( 2.7)\\ ] ]    depends on the plasma beta of the background plasma    @xmath40    the function @xmath41 exhibits an almost perfect `` flip - flop '' behaviour with constant values @xmath42 and @xmath43 below and above @xmath44 .",
    "the other relevant wave damping process is the transit - time damping acceleration of isotropically distributed cosmic rays . according to achterberg ( 1981 ) the corresponding damping rate",
    "is given by    @xmath45 ^ 2\\ , { u_p\\over   u_b}\\quad , \\eqno ( 2.9)\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the energy densities of the background magnetic field and the cosmic ray particles , respectively .",
    "for small wave intensities we can neglect the cascading of waves , so that according to eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) the equilibrium fast - mode intensity is simply given by    @xmath48    calculating following achterberg ( 1981 ) the ratio of the two damping rates ,    @xmath49^{-2}\\ , { c\\over \\pi   ^{1/2}v_a}\\ , \\beta^{1/2}f(\\beta , \\theta ) \\quad , \\eqno ( 2.11)\\ ] ]    we find that this ratio is independent of wavenumber @xmath50 , and for small plasma beta @xmath51 almost independent from the propagation angle @xmath37 since @xmath52 . the ratio is well approximated by    @xmath53    values of @xmath54 indicate that the fast - mode wave energy is damped by accelerating cosmic ray particles .",
    "the condition @xmath54 translates into a condition for the plasma beta    @xmath55    where @xmath56k ) denotes the plasma temperature in units of 10@xmath57k . in the case of equipartition between magnetic field and cosmic rays ,",
    "@xmath58 we find values of @xmath59 less unity if @xmath60 . in conclusion , in a low @xmath17-plasma the fast - mode waves are predominantly dissipated by accelerating cosmic rays by transit - time damping .",
    "the inclusion of wave cascading does not qualitatively modify this conclusion as the numerical solutions of miller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) indicate .",
    "the quasi - linear theory treats the effect of the weakly perturbed magnetic field as perturbations of orbits of particles moving in the average background field .",
    "schlickeiser ( 1989 ) considers quasilinear transport and acceleration parameters for cosmic ray particles interacting resonantly with the alfvn waves propagating along the average magnetic field .",
    "the transport equation can be derived from the fokker - planck equation by a well - known approximate scheme ( jokipii 1966 , hasselmann & wibberenz 1968 ) which is commonly referred to as the diffusion - convection equation for the pitch - angle averaged phase space density .",
    "the electromagnetic fields generated by mhd waves enter into the equation through the lorentz force term . for fast ( @xmath8 ) cosmic ray particles , a vanishing cross helicity state of the alfvn waves and the power - law turbulence spectrum with @xmath61 ,    @xmath62    the momentum diffusion coefficient    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    and",

    "a considered form of @xmath72 admits the pitch angle scattering by transit - time damping of super - alfvnic particles with pitch - angles contained in the range @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . in the interval @xmath76 , where no transit - time damping occurs , the gyroresonance interactions provide a small but finite contribution to the particle scattering rate . as a result the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath1",

    "the approach applied in the present paper for modelling the particle momentum diffusion is based on numerical monte carlo simulations .",
    "the general procedure is quite simple : test particles are injected at random positions into a turbulent magnetized plasma and their trajectories are followed by integration of particle equations of motion . due to the presence of waves , particles move diffusively in configuration and momentum space . by averaging over a large number of trajectories",
    "one derives the diffusion coefficients for turbulent wave fields . in the simulations we consider relativistic particles with @xmath8 and use dimensionless units ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) : @xmath80 for magnetic field perturbations , @xmath81 for time , @xmath82 for wave vectors and @xmath83 for the momentum diffusion coefficient .",
    "below , in all our simulations we adopt @xmath84 and we consider mono - energetic particles with velocity @xmath85 .",
    "this particular choice allows us to compare the effects of different types of turbulence on the particle momentum diffusion coefficient and , due to the large @xmath86 , to evaluate the role of wave anisotropy in the transit - time damping interactions .      in the modelling",
    "we consider a superposition of 384 mhd waves propagating oblique to the average magnetic field @xmath87 .",
    "the wave propagation angle with respect to @xmath11 is randomly chosen from a uniform distribution within a cone ( ` wave - cone ' ) along the mean field .",
    "for a given simulation two symmetric cones are considered centered along @xmath11 , with the opening angle @xmath88 , directed parallel and anti - parallel to the mean field direction . the same number of waves is selected from each cone in order to model the symmetric wave field",
    ". related to the i - th wave , the magnetic field fluctuation vector @xmath89 is given in the form :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is a constant vector selected for a given wave .",
    "the electric field fluctuation related to a particular wave is given as @xmath92 .",
    "for alfvn waves ( ` a ' ) we use the dispersion relation    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the alfvn velocity in the field @xmath95 .",
    "the wave magnetic field polarization is defined by the formula    @xmath96    in a low-@xmath0 plasma the fast - mode magnetosonic waves ( ` m ' ) propagate with the alfvn velocity and the respective relations are :    @xmath97    @xmath98    one should be aware of the fact that the considered turbulence model is unrealistic at large @xmath99 and the present results can not be considered as the exact quantitative ones . in particular , in the presence of a finite amplitude turbulence the magnetic field pressure is larger than the mean field pressure and the wave phase velocities can be greater than @xmath100 assumed here .      in our simulations",
    "we consider the power - law turbulence spectrum in the wave vector range ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the irregular component of the magnetic field , obtained from the energy density defined in equation ( 3.1 ) , can be written as    @xmath101    where @xmath102 ( @xmath103 corresponds to the considered longest ( shortest ) wavelength , respectively , and @xmath104 is the wave spectral index .",
    "in the present simulations we consider the flat spectrum with @xmath12 and the kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath13 . we included the flat spectrum because of our earlier simulations ( michalek & ostrowski 1996 ) , where the alfvn waves with @xmath12 were considered .",
    "it provides also a convenient limiting reference for comparison of results for different wave spectra flatter than the kolmogorov one ( e.g. the kraichnan spectrum or the perturbations spectra at wavelengths longer than the ones characteristic for the inertial range of the mhd cascade ) . on the other hand",
    "such a turbulence spectrum is very convenient for numerical simulations due to presence of a substantial power in short waves . for the flat spectrum",
    "the wave vectors are drawn in a random way from the respective ranges : @xmath105 for ` short ' waves , @xmath106 for ` medium ' waves and @xmath107 for ` long ' waves .",
    "the respective wave amplitudes @xmath108 are drawn in a random manner so as to keep constant    @xmath109    where @xmath99 is a model parameter , and , separately in all mentioned wave - vector ranges    @xmath110    thus the wave energy is uniformly distributed over the considered wave - vector ranges . as a second , more realistic turbulence model we consider one involving the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "the observed spectra in interplanetary space often have such a form ( e.g. jokipii 1971 ) and this case is most often discussed in the literature . here",
    "all 384 wave vectors are drawn in a random manner from the whole considered range ( @xmath111 ) , but the amplitudes @xmath112 are fitted according to the kolmogorov distribution ( eq . 4.6 with @xmath13 ) and scaled to keep the formula ( 4.7 ) valid .",
    "in such turbulence most of energy is carried by long waves .    in the discussion below",
    "we will consider four different turbulence fields labeled as follows : + i.  alfvn waves with the flat spectrum - af , + ii .",
    "alfvn waves with the kolmogorov spectrum - ak , + iii .",
    "fast - mode waves with the flat spectrum - mf , + iv .",
    "fast - mode waves with the kolmogorov spectrum - mk .",
    "in the present numerical simulations we consider a number of physical situations  turbulence models with finite wave amplitudes and a changing degree of wave anisotropy  not described by analytic means .",
    "the results are illustrated in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "first , the simulated momentum diffusion coefficients , @xmath1 , for the alfvn and the magnetosonic turbulence are presented in fig .  1 . : in the upper panels variation of @xmath1 versus the perturbation amplitude @xmath99 for the alfvn turbulence and in the middle panels for the fast - mode turbulence . to enable comparison these results",
    "are superimposed in bottom panels .",
    "the derived momentum diffusion coefficients are given for different wave - cone opening angles .",
    "the models with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 represent degenerated one - dimensional , anisotropic and isotropic wave vector distributions , respectively . for clarity ,",
    "only the results for the mentioned three values are presented , but we also performed simulations for other intermediate wave cone openings : @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the results of these simulations are consistent with the ones described below .    at fig .  1",
    ", in all cases a systematic increase of @xmath1 with @xmath99 can be observed .",
    "usually , it follows the quasi - linear relation @xmath118 , except for the magnetosonic waves with @xmath119 , where the increase rate seems to be smaller at least at large amplitudes , where it is roughly @xmath120 .    for the alfvn wave turbulence",
    "an increase of the wave - cone opening angle @xmath121 providing waves with smaller phase velocities leads to decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the trend is independent of the considered turbulence amplitude and the considered spectrum . in the case of",
    "fast - mode waves a more complicated relation is observed . for the flat turbulence spectrum a small increase of the angle @xmath121 does not lead to a significant variation of @xmath1 , and",
    "the change is to smaller values of @xmath1 , like for the alfvn waves .",
    "only the appearance of waves with wave vectors nearly perpendicular to the mean magnetic field changes this trend leading to an increase of @xmath1 ( by a factor of three for @xmath119 in comparison to @xmath113 at @xmath122 ) .",
    "for the kolmogorov turbulence the wave cone opening - angle increase in the mk model is always followed by an increase of @xmath1 ( in our simulations small values of @xmath121 , between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , were not considered ) and again it reaches the maximum in the presence of perpendicular waves .    in order to explain this non - monotonic behavior one can refer to the quasi - linear derivations of schlickeiser & miller ( 1998 ) .",
    "for @xmath5 the resonance condition for the transit - time damping may be written as @xmath125 and , with the dispersion relation ( 4.4 ) , @xmath126 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath127 particles can effciently interact with waves at a wide range of @xmath128 only if the waves with @xmath129 are present .",
    "this fact can explain the effective transit - time damping interactions for magnetosonic waves with isotropic distribution .",
    "then , the observed @xmath1 increase results mainly from the presence of a small fraction of waves propagating quasi - perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "one should note that our simulations were performed for relativistic particles with @xmath130 , where the effect is quite pronounced .    in order to verify this behaviour in more detail we considered interaction of such relativistic particles with waves propagating in narrow pitch angle ranges with respect to the mean magnetic field",
    ": we performed simulations for wave vector inclinations selected from the angular ranges ( @xmath131 ) around the cones with @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that only the presence of waves with wave vectors perpendicular to the mean magnetic field leads to a significant increase of @xmath1 . for these waves the transit - time damping resonance provides the wave - particle coupling , while the waves propagating nearly parallel to the average magnetic field contribute preferentially due to the gyroresonance .",
    "of course , our reference to the calculations involving various resonances is only approximate , as in the presence of high amplitude waves the quasi - linear delta form of interaction changes into the ` broadened resonance ' , as discussed by karimabadi et al .",
    "the simulation errors can be evaluated from comparison at fig - s  1,2 of the ` m ' and ` a ' results for @xmath113 , which should coincide .",
    "we considered the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath1 in the presence of oblique alfvn and magnetosonic waves with a wide range of amplitudes , from medium , up to non - linear ones .",
    "the influence of the degree of wave anisotropy and the waves spectral index was also studied . as expected , in all cases a systematic increase of @xmath1 with the wave amplitude is observed .",
    "we confirm a substantial increase of @xmath1 for the fast - mode waves in comparison to the alfvn waves of the same amplitude , if nearly perpendicular fast - mode waves are present .",
    "the effect is caused by the transit - time damping interactions which occur in the presence of magnetosonic waves containing a compressive component of @xmath135 .",
    "for the isotropic fast - mode kolmogorov turbulence ( cf .",
    "eq - s 3.2,4 ) @xmath1 is expected to be on a factor of @xmath136 , multiplied by a term depending on the index @xmath104 , larger than the one for alfvn waves propagating parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "the ratio of these values is about three in our simulations for small @xmath99 , which confirms ( within the simulation errors ) the quasi - linear result . in simulations for the isotropic kolmogorov spectra @xmath137",
    "is roughly constant for a wide range of waves amplitudes . for the isotropic mk and mf models",
    "one observes that the transit - time damping scattering weakens with an increasing @xmath99 .",
    "for these models , @xmath138 , when some particles can become timely trapped between the compressive waves and the acceleration due to the transit - time damping becomes less efficient .",
    "fast - mode waves can effectively accelerate cosmic ray particles if other dissipation processes heating the plasma are negligibly small . in section  2",
    "we demonstrated that for a low beta - plasma , @xmath139 , the fast - mode waves can be predominantly dissipated by accelerating cosmic rays through the transit - time damping mechanism .",
    "in addition , the momentum diffusion enhancement due to presence of fast - mode waves could also work effectively in a volume with the turbulence generation force acting .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of a strong shock , where the conditions with @xmath140 can occur ( cf .",
    "drury 1983 ) , or in a region of magnetic field reconnection the required fast - mode perpendicular waves are expected to be effectively created .",
    "one should remember that the waves phase velocities are expected to be larger in realistic turbulence than @xmath100 assumed here .",
    "therefore our results for large @xmath99 should rather be considered as the lower limits for @xmath1 .",
