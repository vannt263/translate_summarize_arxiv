    "because the crsf detection strongly depends on the continuum spectrum , the accuracy of the detector response matrix is very important in the study .",
    "however , as reported in goldwurm et al .",
    "2003 , the response matrix of the isgri detector is under development . to make the spectrum fitting using the response matrix distributed by integral science data center  ( isdc ) , a large systematic error , about 10% , is required .",
