    "the collapse of a wave function is an undeniable feature of individual quantum mechanical systems .",
    "however , the collapse of a state along a @xmath0 = constant surface of an arbitrary coordinate system is unbelievable , inasmuch as nature does not recognize a surface that is so obviously constructed by humans . for this reason , a foundation theory must provide for the collapse of a wave along an invariant surface that is independent of coordinate representations .",
    "the collapse of a wave is not just invariant , it is trans - representational ; that is , it is independent of any choice of basis states .",
    "furthermore , it will collapse along the surface of the backward time cone that is here called a _ conic _ surface .",
    "this is the hellwig and kraus state reduction @xcite that has been widely dismissed as being causally problematic @xcite .",
    "the supposed paradox can not be resolved by relativity and quantum mechanics alone because a foundation theory is also required .",
    "this will govern the collapse and impose constraints that establish an unambiguous temporal and causal order between reductions .",
    "when that is done , it is shown below that a ` later ' collapse can not causally penetrate the backward time cone of a ` former ' collapse . and",
    "since a collapse occurs against a background of countless widely disbursed prior collapses , the spatial - temporal extent of any collapse in minkowski space is limited .",
    "one consequence of a hellwig - kraus reduction is that the newly collapsed state must also be the initial state of the next phase of evolution .",
    "so initial states as well as collapsed states are conically defined .",
    "therefore the most natural quantum mechanical state is a function mapped onto the conic surface of the backward time cone of an event in space - time .",
    "it is shown that the dynamic principle projects these functions forward to successor conic states whose vertices lie along a specified world line .",
    "claims regarding a hellwig - kraus causal ambiguity are usually advanced by referring to non - local correlations . consider a pair of particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are created by a decay to become correlated in the spin zero state .",
    "@xmath3 the first particle moves to the left in fig .  1 and the second particle moves to the right .",
    "initially they both have an uncertain spin direction as indicated by the double vertical arrow along each path in that figure .",
    "imagine that the first particle is measured to have spin - up at an event * a * in fig .  1",
    ", causing a hellwig - kraus state reduction . in that case",
    "@xmath2 will go spin - down when it intercepts the backward light cone of event * a * at event * b*. if @xmath2 is measured later at event * b * it will of course record spin - down .",
    "the result is the state @xmath4 .",
    "capital bold face letters indicate events that ` cause ' state reduction like measurements ; and lower case bold face letters identify events that are not vertices of reduction sites .",
    "event * b * also results in a state reduction .",
    "the effect of * b * on @xmath1 might conceivably be the same as the effect of * a * on @xmath2 , where @xmath1 goes spin - up the moment it intercepts the backward light cone of event * b * at event * a * as shown in .",
    "so when @xmath1 is later measured at * a * it will record spin - up .",
    "the final results are then the same as those shown in , but this possibility leads to an odd circularity that is characteristic of a causal loop : * a * causes * b * causes * b * , and * b * causes * a * causes * a*.        these two particles are shown to follow straight lines even though they are waves spreading out over the indicated paths .",
    "this does not matter because the rules developed here are not concerned with paths .",
    "we are concerned only with the location of reduction events like * a * and * b * and their associated conic states .",
    "the straight lines in these figures may be thought of as having heuristic value only .",
    "the _ qrules _ are three rules given in another paper that govern the collapse of a wave function @xcite . these rules generate _ qrule equations _ that are of the form    @xmath5    where @xmath0 is _ conic time _ as opposed to conventional _",
    "lorentz time_. the lorentz time at an event * x * is defined over a horizontal plane that passes through * x * , whereas conic time is defined over the conic surface with its vertex at * x*.    it is shown in appendix i how a conventional lorentz wave function @xmath6 with its origin at * x * can be mapped into a conic wave function @xmath7 with its vertex at * x * , where * r * represents a variable that is defined ( in appendix i ) on the conic surface in 3 + 1 space .",
    "we say that the conic wave function @xmath7 mirrors the lorentz wave function @xmath6 in a flat minkowki space .",
    "the qrule component @xmath8 is then given by the square modulus of @xmath7 with its * r * variable integrated out , making a qrule component a function of @xmath0 only .",
    "it is also shown in that a conic dynamic principle that mirrors the standard dynamic principle will project the conic function @xmath7 into successor vertices along the indicated world line .",
    "a qrule equation is always given by a capital @xmath9 as a function of the components @xmath8 or @xmath10 may be expressed differently .",
    "for instance , the component @xmath8 consisting of an atom @xmath11 and a molecule @xmath12 can be written .",
    "each component in a qrule equation is ` complete ' in that it implicitly contains all the particles in the universe ( ref.3 ) .",
    "the plus sign in a qrule equation always indicates a _ discontinuous _ quantum jump that is also _",
    "the particle pair @xmath1 and @xmath2 in eq .  1 is assumed to be created at an event * 0 * that results from of a decay that begins at a prior conic time @xmath13 along some preferred world line . if the pair is created by the decay of a composite particle @xmath14 , the corresponding qrule equation is given by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 s in this equation are the _ qrule values _ of the designated particles .",
    "they represent the square modulus of the conic function of each particle with its independent variables integrated out . in particular , the component @xmath17 is the qrule value of the zero spin wave function @xmath18 in eq .  1 .",
    "the fact that the first particle goes to the left ( in fig .  1 ) and",
    "the second particle goes to the right is a distinction that is lost to this component  because it has been integrated out along with the spin distinction .",
    "in addition , the component @xmath19 in eq .  2 is the qrule value of the composite particle that produces the decay particles .",
    "both of these are trans - representational components that are derived from wave functions on conic surfaces in minkowski space , where @xmath0 is the conic time referring to these surfaces .",
    "their evolution is governed by the dynamic principle operating on the underlying wave function .",
    "each component is multiplied by an environmental term representing the rest of the universe , thereby satisfying the requirement that it is ` complete ' .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 in these equations does not affect the outcome as will be demonstrated .    the second component in eq .  2",
    "is underlined , meaning that it is a _",
    "ready _ component .",
    "ready components are not empirically real , so the component @xmath17 in eq",
    ".  2 refers to particles that do not yet exist at time @xmath0 in that equation .",
    "the non - underlined component @xmath19 is called a _ realized _ component .",
    "it does exist at time @xmath0 in that equation .",
    "the second component @xmath17 is zero at time @xmath13 and increases in time as probability current flows to it from the first component @xmath19 in eq .",
    "the gap between them represented by the + sign is the decay interaction that is discontinuous and irreversible .",
    "the qrules tell us that the probability current gives the probability per unit time that the second component will experience a stochastic hit .",
    "only ready components can be stochastically chosen according to the qrules .",
    "if a hit occurs at a time @xmath20 ( the time of event * 0 * ) , then the rules tell us that there will be a collapse of to @xmath21 where the first component in eq .",
    "2 goes to zero . the wave function associated with eq .",
    "3 is also mapped onto backward time - cone surfaces  in this case on vertices of the successors of event * 0 * , where the time variable is the conic time referring to these vertices .",
    "equations 2 and 3 reflect the fact that the collapse of a wave function in quantum mechanics is a trans - representational affair .",
    "the dynamic principle directs the evolution of a qrule equation , but the qrules govern the stochastic process that interrupts its continuous flow .",
    "the foundation theory of ghirardi et .",
    "al . incorporates a collapse directly into the dynamic principle @xcite , but that theory is not trans - representational .",
    "when the spin - measuring devices @xmath22 and @xmath23 of particle @xmath1 and @xmath2 are later introduced , eq .  3 becomes the qrule equation @xmath24p_2(\\downarrow)\\otimes m_2(t )   \\\\   & + & \\underline{p}_1(\\uparrow)[p_2(\\downarrow)m_2]\\otimes m_1(t )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ \\underline{p}_1(\\downarrow)m_1]p_2(\\uparrow)\\otimes m_2(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\underline{p}_1(\\downarrow)[p_2(\\uparrow)m_2]\\otimes m_1(t ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both measuring devices are on standby in the first component of eq .  4 , and the four ` ready ' components ( on the right ) are zero at @xmath20 . in the ready component of the first row",
    "the first particle engages the spin - measuring device @xmath22 ( in square brackets ) , and in the second row the second particle engages @xmath23 .",
    "the third and fourth rows are similar except that they provide for the reverse spin measurements .",
    "probability current begins to flow from the first component to the ready components in the first and third rows when the first particle interacts with the measuring device @xmath22 sometime after @xmath20 .",
    "current will begin to flow to the ready components in the second and fourth rows when the second particle interacts with @xmath23 .",
    "so all four ready components are exposed to the possibility of a stochastic hit .",
    "figure 3a is a graphic description of .",
    "the gray area in that figure represents the minkowski region of interaction where the ready components in eq .",
    "4 become non - zero ( i.e. , where the particle interacts with the detector ) .",
    "neither one of the world lines in fig .",
    "3a defines the time @xmath0 in eq .",
    "that time specifies the chosen orientation ( i.e. , the chosen lorentz observer ) in the minkowski space . since the probability of any one of these ready states being stochastically chosen is independent of the choice of _ t _ , eq .",
    "4 is invariant under _",
    "t_. if another @xmath0 is chosen , then the world lines in fig .",
    "3 will be rotated to the left or to the right ( as with a lorentz transformation ) , but the orientation of the conic surfaces will be unchanged . the graphic relationships in fig .",
    "3 will be unchanged , except event simultaneity .",
    "suppose the first row in eq .",
    "4 is stochastically chosen at a time @xmath25 .",
    "the system is then reduced to @xmath26p_2(\\downarrow)\\otimes m_2(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the time of the stochastic hit at event * a * that appears along the world line of @xmath1 ( see fig .  3b representing eq .  5 ) .",
    "it is again understood that the wave functions representing @xmath27 , and @xmath23 in this figure are spread out over the conic surface of the vertex of event * a * in fig .",
    "3b . equation 5 not only represents event * a * , it also represents the cut - off event * b * that is simultaneous with * a * in conic time .",
    "we make no assumption as to the world lines of the measuring devices .",
    "further evolution carries the resulting conic state forward following event * a * until @xmath2 interacts with @xmath23 .",
    "a new ready state then emerges giving @xmath28p_2({\\downarrow})\\otimes m_2(t )     \\\\   & + & [ \\underline{p}_1({\\uparrow})m_1][p_2({\\downarrow})m_2](t ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is graphically represented in fig .",
    "3c in which the shaded area is the region of the new interaction that gives rise to the ready component in the second row of eq .",
    "6 when @xmath2 encounters @xmath23 .    the evolution of the second particle after event * b * in fig .",
    "3c repeats part of the evolution that has already occurred in fig .  3a .",
    "the latter part of this evolution involves the interaction @xmath29 $ ] between the second particle and its measuring device .",
    "this part is not empirically significant because its repetition consists in its appearance in both ` ready ' components of both eqs .",
    "4 . an interaction repetition like this would occur even if the time in eqs .",
    "4 referred to lorentz time , so it is not a characteristic of a hellwig - kraus reduction .",
    "it is a feature of _ any _ correlated state reduction .",
    "however , the free particle part of the repetition certainly does involve the realized component in eqs .  4 ,",
    "so it does ( in principle ) have empirical significance .",
    "it is also characteristic of a hellwig - kraus collapse .",
    "but this free particle part is not really measurable because it exists independent of a measurement interaction .",
    "let a second state reduction occur at event * b * at time @xmath30 , giving the final result @xmath31[p_2(\\downarrow)m_2](t)\\ ] ] equation 7 appears in fig .",
    "since the qrules are trans - representational they give us an objective account of what happens .",
    "equation 4 causally precedes eq .  5 , and that causally precedes eq .  6 , and that causally precedes eq .  7 .",
    "causal priority is established by the _ formal _",
    "priority among these equations .",
    "a collapse equation comes into existence only when its predecessor disappears .",
    "we state the corollary .",
    "* corollary : * _ the evolution of a qrule equation can not affect the evolution of a previously ` collapsed ' qrule equation  since the latter no longer exists . _",
    "this means that the evolution described in eq .",
    "6 can have no influence on the evolution described in eq .  4 ;",
    "for when eq .",
    "6 is actively evolving , eq .",
    "4 _ no longer exists_. therefore , event * b * can not influence event * a*. this is indicated in fig .",
    "3d where the backward time cone of event * b * is not allowed to ` penetrate ' the backward time cone of event * a*.        it is the qrules that govern the causal order of reduction , not relativity or standard quantum mechanics , and these rules are perfectly clear concerning priority .",
    "this is shown graphically in the minkowski space of fig .",
    "the more darkly shaded area ( below * a * in fig .",
    "4 ) indicates the region of minkowski space that evolves according to eq .  4 ; and the more lightly shaded area ( below * b * ) indicates the region that evolves according to eq .  6 , where the lighter area can have no influence on the darker area because the latter is causally prior . the reductions in fig .",
    "4 go to infinity on the left and on the right as expected of a hellwig - kraus collapse .",
    "however , the event * b * collapse is limited in that it can not penetrate the event * a * reduction . this will generally be the case .",
    "the universe is full of prior reductions that can not be penetrated by either events * a * or * b * ; and as a result , both reductions will be limited in the space - time extent of their influence .",
    "this is not just true of correlated reductions , but will also be true of independent reductions ( see appendix ii ) .",
    "following event * b * , the measuring device @xmath22 ( that now includes particle @xmath1 ) evolves _ independent _ of the measuring device @xmath23 ( that now includes @xmath2 ) .",
    "these two systems can be described along two different conic world lines designated @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath32 begins with the vertex at event * a * , and a conic time @xmath33 begins with the vertex at event * b*. it is not necessary to introduce these dual times , but doing so helps to emphasize the spatial separation as well as the independence of the two systems .",
    "the underlying conic function is then of the form @xmath34 which comes about by using two different origins ( on the horizontal @xmath35-axis ) to describe two widely separated systems . as a result ,",
    "a single cone spreading over two systems of this kind is replaced by an envelope that drapes over both  like the lightly shaded area over events * a * and * b * in fig.4 . the qrule equation following event * b * is then written @xmath36[p_2(\\downarrow)m_1(t_2 ) + \\underline{i}_2(t_2)]\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is an interaction that is located in some part of the lightly shaded envelope above event * a * in fig .",
    "4 , and @xmath38 is another interaction that is located in the lightly shaded envelope above event * b*. we simplify the equation by dropping the time dependence in each component @xmath39[p_2(\\downarrow)m_1 + \\underline{i}_2]\\ ] ] where subscript-1 states are understood to be on the @xmath32 conic surface , and subscript-2 states are understood to be on the @xmath33 conic surface .",
    "equation 8 might not seem entirely correct according to the qrules .",
    "the recipient state @xmath40 in each bracket of the equation does not appear to be a complete component ; and if that were true , it would not be a ready component .",
    "however , the equation can be written in the form @xmath41 + \\underline{i}_1[p_2(\\downarrow)m_2 + \\underline{i}_2]\\ ] ] the brackets in this equation have a square modulus that is constant in time , so the current from the first component comes solely from @xmath42 and goes exclusively to @xmath43 .",
    "since both components are clearly complete , the first must be a realized component and the second is a ready component . both _",
    "i _ s in eq .",
    "8 can be understood in this way .",
    "we therefore keep the form of eq .",
    "it can be generalized to any number of independent systems in a way that satisfies the qrules .    in 2 + 1 space the mountaintops in fig .  4",
    "do not appear in front or in back of one another .",
    "rather , they are superimposed on one another like mountains on a flat terrain .",
    "a new peak will not penetrate an old peak on that terrain because the above corollary holds for all completed state reductions  including independent as well as correlated reductions as will be shown in appendix ii .",
    "these mountaintops all build on top of one another without penetration .",
    "it is important to understand how eq .  4 and fig .  3",
    "play out relative to a lorentz frame in which event * a * occurs ( causally ) before event * b * but appears to follow in lorentz time .",
    "figure 5a is identical with fig.3a where the regions of measurement interaction for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indicated by the darkened world lines .",
    "figure 5b looks at the same interactions relative to a lorentz frame in which the second particle is at rest .",
    "this is called the ` primed ' frame .",
    "equation 4 has the same form relative to the primed frame as it does relative to the unprimed frame .",
    "the difference is only in the way that current flows from the realized component to the four ready components . in the unprimed frame ( fig .",
    "5a ) current flows simultaneously into all four components for as long as it takes for a stochastic hit on the first component ( in our example ) . in the primed frame ( fig .",
    "5b ) current begins to flow into the second particle _ before _",
    "it begins to flow into the first particle  in lorentz time .",
    "however , this current will run out without the second particle being stochastically chosen , while current continues to flow into the first particle . as a result ,",
    "the first particle is the first to be stochastically chosen at event * a * ( in fig .",
    "5c ) , thereby cutting off the second particle at , which is again _ simultaneous _ with event * a * in conic time .",
    "the second particle is subsequently revived at a time that allows it to again interact with the measuring device @xmath23 , thereby allowing it to be stochastically chosen at event * b * ( fig .",
    "5d ) _ after _ event * a * in conic time ",
    "although it is _ before _ in lorentz time .",
    "the second particle does not exactly repeat its prior history .",
    "the first time that it interacts with the measuring device it is not stochastically chosen , but the second time ( following event * b * ) it is stochastically chosen . the first time the probability of a hit on event * b * is 0.25 , the second time it is 1.0 .",
    "this repetition has no empirical significance because both interactions appear inside ready components . in general ,",
    "stochastic interactions are not empirically real in qrule theory .",
    "stochastic hits are empirically real .    figures 3 and 5 represent two different lorentz observers , where the causal and the temporal order of events are the same in both frames . only in lorentz time",
    "does there appear to be some disagreement between the causal and temporal orders .",
    "we attribute this to fact that lorentz time is given along artificiality defined horizontal planar surfaces .",
    "the structure in figs .  3 and 5 should be the same for any foundational theory that is viewed in an invariant way .",
    "if the theory in question provides for the collapse of a wave like eq .  1 , and if the collapse travels backward over a conic surface in a way that destroys the possibility of any further influence on itself , then it should produce the same minkowki architecture that appears in .",
    "for any such theory , in any lorentz frame , the measurement interaction of the second particle will run its course without result ( in our example ) allowing to be chosen first .",
    "the resulting collapse will re - start the second particle at an event like * b * in fig .",
    "3b that is conically _ simultaneous _ with * a * , so event * b * will occur _ after _ event * a * in conic time . as in our qrule analysis",
    ", it is the reduction theory that governs the casual order , not relativity or standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the result will be the succession of mountain peaks like those shown in fig .  4 , where a peak in background occurs causally and temporally _ after _ a peak in foreground , and where both are limited in space and time by other reductions .",
    "a paradoxical causal loop seems to appear when the collapse of a quantum mechanical wave function is viewed as a hellwig - kraus reduction in minkowski space .",
    "this paradox can not be removed by special relativity and/or standard quantum mechanics alone , but requires the constraints imposed by a suitable foundation theory governing the collapse . in this paper",
    "the qrule foundation theory is used to resolve this causal difficulty .",
    "we define conic time @xmath0 over the surface of a backward time cone of some event * x*. a quantum mechanical wave function @xmath44 is also mapped onto that surface .",
    "this function is used instead of the usual quantum mechanical wave function @xmath45 that is defined on a horizontal surface going through * x*.    a hellwig - kraus reduction describes two correlated space - like reduction ev - ents * a * and * b * , and it is found that the qrules establish a definite causal priority between them .",
    "there is no _ causal loop _ or temporal ambiguity between these two events when the qrules govern the collapse .",
    "the causal and conic temporal orders of events * a * and * b * are the _ same_. the resulting landscape in minkowski space is shown in fig .  4 , where each mountaintop in that figure is a separate reduction .",
    "the peak in the background of fig .  4 will occur causally and temporally _ after _ the peak in the foreground .",
    "the background reduction can not ` penetrate ' or causally influence the interior of the foreground reduction , as shown in the figure .",
    "any reduction will take place against a background of countless prior reductions that can not be penetrated , thereby limiting its range in space and time .",
    "this will be true even if the reduction is independent ( i.e. , not a correlation ) as is shown in appendix ii .",
    "it is my belief that the structure of fig",
    ".  4 will be similar for any foundation theory that is viewed in an invariant way , so long as the theory requires that a collapse destroys the possibility of any further influence on itself  as do the qrules .",
    "the dynamic principle is understood to influence the temporal development of a qrule component through the underlying function @xmath46 .",
    "this function is defined in this paper and evolves in time as described in appendix i. however , the qrules govern state reduction and therefore interrupt the dynamic process under the right conditions .",
    "more will be said in a subsequent paper about the relationship between the dynamic principle , the qrule equations , and the architecture of state reduction in minkowski space .",
    "a particle is initially located at @xmath20 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 in fig .",
