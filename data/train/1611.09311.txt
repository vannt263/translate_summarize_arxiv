    "the two most widely used families of non - relativistic nuclear energy density functionals ( edfs ) are based on the skyrme  @xcite and gogny  @xcite functional generators .",
    "the main difference between them is that the skyrme - type generators are built as sums of contact terms with nonlocal gradient corrections , whereas the gogny - type ones are built as sums of local finite - range gaussians . in gogny and most skyrme parametrizations , to conveniently reproduce properties of homogeneous nuclear matter , a two - body density - dependent generator is usually used , most often with a fractional power of the density .",
    "unfortunately , such an approach leads to non - analytic properties of beyond - mean - field edf in the complex plane  @xcite , compromises symmetry - restoration procedures  @xcite , and introduces self - interaction contributions in the particle - vibration coupling vertex  @xcite .",
    "thus , to gain progress in the development of a consistent description of atomic nucleus , there clearly appears a need to build edfs that are free from the above spuriousities .",
    "such functionals can be obtained by defining their potential parts as hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) expectation values of genuine pseudopotential operators .",
    "in fact , this was the original idea of skyrme who first introduced the name pseudopotential in this context  @xcite . without density - dependent terms and taking all exchange and pairing terms into account",
    ", this gives edfs for which the pauli principle is strictly obeyed and removes all spurious contributions .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , also here we call such pseudopotentials edf generators .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have already fully developed the formalism that uses contact and regularized higher - order pseudopotentials to generate the most general terms in the edf compatible with symmetries .",
    "there were several recent attempts to use such edfs , like the development of the skyrme  inspired family of functionals slymr which include 3- and 4-body terms  @xcite , our previous parametrization of the regularized finite - range pseudopotential reg2  @xcite , or functional vlyb , which implemented higher - order contact terms  @xcite .",
    "however none of the previous attempts managed to reproduce both bulk and pairing properties of finite nuclei , while ensuring at the same time stability of homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "the aim of this article is thus to present a further step in the construction of a predictive pseudopotential - based edf .",
    "we present an adjustment of a parametrization of the regularized finite - range higher - order local and density - independent pseudopotential , which achieves an acceptable qualitative description both in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels without leading to infinite - matter instabilities . with the limitation of the current implementation being only purely two - body and local",
    ", a sufficiently high value of the infinite - matter effective mass could not be obtained . however , reasonably good results obtained for bulk and pairing properties of finite nuclei demonstrate proof - of - principle feasibility of such program .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : regpp ] we briefly recall the form of the pseudopotential and present the corresponding edf terms in particle - hole and particle - particle channels . the numerical implementation of the mean - field equations in the new hfb spherical solver @xmath1 is briefly discussed in section  [ sec : finres ] . the strategy used to adjust the parameters is given in section  [ sec : fit ] . in section  [ sec : res ] we discuss statistical errors of the resulting parameters and observables , and present selected results for infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we recall the cartesian form of the regularized pseudopotential as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we derived the corresponding edf both in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels up to n@xmath2lo , whereas below we show them up to nlo .",

    "eigenvalues of the hessian matrix are indicative of how well the penalty function is constrained in those directions of the parameter space that are given by its eigenvectors . from the gap between the second and third eigenvalue it clearly appears that , irrespective of the order at which the pseudopotential is built , two such directions are well constrained . beyond this second eigenvalue , the eigenvalues decrease in a fairly regular manner , and it is not possible to unambiguously define a dividing point between relevant and irrelevant eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the directions given by the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix mix all the terms of the pseudopotential , so that no coupling constant ( for the parametrization we have adopted ) can be removed or frozen to get rid of a specific small eigenvalue .    ) , average neutron pairing gaps ( @xmath148 ) , and proton rms radii ( @xmath149 ) calculated for the spherical nucleus @xmath124sn as a functions of the number of smallest eigenvalues kept in the spectrum of the covariance matrix .",

    "its average value , calculated for a vector of derivatives of a given observable with respect to the parameters of the model , is called propagated error of the observable . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reg - propagated ] , we show such propagated errors determined for several observables in @xmath124sn and @xmath152er as functions of the number of largest eigenvalues kept in the spectrum of the hessian matrix .    we see that for the two considered nuclei , the propagated errors are qualitatively similar when going from nlo to n@xmath0lo",
    ". errors of the total binding energies are generally small , of the order of 0.1  % , and do not show any significant dependence on the number of kept eigenvalues . for @xmath124sn ,",
    "the errors of the average neutron pairing gaps are similarly small and almost flat .",
    "this means that these observables , which were included in the definition of the penalty function , section  [ sec : penalty ] , are insensitive to the unconstrained directions in the parameter space .",
    "similarly , flatness of the propagated errors of the binding energy of @xmath152er , which was not included in the penalty function , indicates that adding this one observable to the penalty function would not help in better constraining the model parameters .",
    "the propagated errors of the proton rms radii are only about 0.01  % in the extreme case when only one eigenvalue is kept , and for five or more eigenvalues they reach what is approximately a plateau of 0.20.4  % .",
    "this means that directions in the parameter space that are associated with about five largest eigenvalues are meaningful , and should be included in the covariance matrix .",
    "moreover , for @xmath152er , the propagated errors of radii increase significantly when the last eigenvalue ( nlo ) , or three last eigenvalues ( n@xmath0lo ) , are taken into account .",
    "this means that the current penalty function , which does not carry information concerning the structural properties of deformed nuclei , would be enriched by incorporating such information in future parameter adjustments .",
    "this conclusion is substantiated by the propagated errors of quadrupole moments , which increase from 0.1  % to even 100  % .",
    "the main , and striking , difference between the results obtained for @xmath124sn and @xmath152er concerns the average pairing gaps .",
    "as we already said , in @xmath124sn , the propagated errors of the neutron gap are small and almost flat . however , in @xmath152er , one sees a clear gradual increase of errors of pairing gaps with the number of kept eigenvalues .",
    "these large propagated errors are likely associated with the sensitivity of gaps to deformation .",
    "indeed , changes of coupling constants induce changes of shape of the @xmath152er ground state , and thus changes of its single - particle spectrum .",
    "this , in turn , can significantly modify the average pairing gaps and lead to large calculated propagated errors .",
    "altogether , we conclude that adding to the penalty function data on spectroscopic properties of deformed nuclei may be more interesting from the point of view of constraining the model parameters than adding those related to their bulk properties like masses or radii .",
    "for the following part of this article , to calculate the propagated errors , we chose to keep five largest eigenvalues of the hessian matrices .",
    "this choice is based on the observation that beyond this point , several propagated errors , like those of radii , stop changing in a significant way .",
    "the corresponding covariance matrices are provided in the supplemental material  [ url ] . in table",
    "[ tab : cc ] we show statistical errors of the coupling constants , which are equal to square roots of diagonal elements of the covariance matrices  @xcite .",
    "note that in table  [ tab : cc ] we show unrounded values of the coupling constants , with several more digits beyond the statistically significant ones .",
    "nevertheless , performing calculations with properly rounded values does change results , and significantly increases values of the penalty functions that move away from their minima .",
    "these changes are , of course , within bounds of propagated errors and thus are statistically insignificant , however , they also spoil smooth behaviour of observables and parameters as functions of the regularization range @xmath96 . therefore ,",
    "in all calculations we recommend using the unrounded values of the coupling constants .",
    "note also , that errors of parameters serve to illustrate the overall uncertainty of parameters only , whereas proper propagated errors of observables must be obtained by using the full covariance matrices .",

    "apart from the two open shell nuclei , the agreement of the calculated binding energies with the experimental data is compatible with the calculated propagated errors .",
    "larger deviations are obtained for the two outliers , @xmath124sn and @xmath153pb , which can most probably be related to the low effective mass and the resulting unrealistically small density of single - particle states .",
    "results obtained for both pseudopotentials are fairly similar , and we do not see any significant improvement when going from nlo to n@xmath0lo .",

    "these calculations were performed using finite harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "therefore , the results carry some trivial offset with respect to how the parameters were adjusted ; nevertheless , the same basis was used for all three sets of calculations , and thus the relative energies are fully meaningful .",

    "neutron gaps obtained for the pseudopotentials are fairly large , and almost for all nuclei considered here exceed those given by d1s .",
    "the primary goal of this preliminary study was to check if the form of the pseudopotential we develop allows us to generate interaction that is enough attractive in the particle - particle channel to lead to significant gaps .",
    "[ fig : reg - deltan ] shows that this goal was achieved .",
    "however , we also obtained proton gaps that often collapse in the deformed minima .",
    "this latter unwanted feature may once again be due to the low effective mass and too small density of single - particle energies .",
    "in this article , we considered a local finite - range pseudopotential with a gaussian regulator and derived its contributions to the particle - hole and particle - particle energies and to mean - field equations up to n@xmath0lo .",
    "when supplemented with a zero - range two - body force acting in the particle - hole channel , it allowed us to build the first nuclear energy density functional that correctly describes paired finite nuclei without using density - dependent terms .    to adjust the coupling constants of the pseudopotential , we defined a penalty function that constrained properties of selected spherical nuclei along with those of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "its behaviour near the minimum allowed us to evaluate statistical errors of coupling constants and propagated errors of observables , including those for selected deformed nuclei . in this way , we were able to determine well and poorly constrained directions in the parameters space .",
    "we consider the present parameterization to be an initial step towards a more definite solutions only . at present , the pseudopotential considered here gives low values of the effective mass , and consequently low densities of single - particle states in finite nuclei .",
    "in future implementations , we plan to correct for this by introducing three - body ( or four - body ) terms , eventually supplemented by velocity - dependent terms  @xcite .",
    "our approach would then correspond to an extension of the interaction proposed by onishi and negele  @xcite , who showed that it may have encouraging results for mean - field calculations .",
