    "an attested deviation to the early kolmogorov s turbulence theory is the fact that dissipation is intermittent , in space and time : the fraction of the volume and the timescale over which dissipation is active decreases with spatial scales @xcite . while the turbulent velocity follows a gaussian distribution , intermittency makes its increments over a distance @xmath23 to depart from a gaussian : tails show up because large increments are more numerous than in a gaussian distribution .",
    "this non - gaussianity is more pronounced when decreasing @xmath23 . as a consequence of intermittency , the velocity shear ( @xmath24 ) reaches large values at small scale , that manifest themselves as bursts of viscous dissipation ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the fluid velocity ) .",
    "these violent events are associated to the non - gaussian tails of the distribution of the velocity shear .",
    "interstellar turbulence can only be partially probed : we measure the gas velocity projected along the line of sight ( los ) and the position projected in the plane of the sky ( pos ) .",
    "all observables are los integrals : they result from a complex combination of radiative transfer in lines , chemistry , density and velocity structures of the gas . @xcite",
    "have shown that in the case of optically thin lines , the increments of line centroid velocities ( cvis ) measured between two different los trace a quantity related to the los average of the pos projection of the velocity shears .",
    "it is therefore possible , from the cvis statistics computed in a map of spectra , to approach that of the velocity shear , and find the subset of space where the departures from a gaussian distribution occur .",
