    "non - markovian processes occurring in open quantum systems have become an active research topic during recent years  @xcite .",
    "the rapid pace of research and the lack of a unique , widely accepted definition of quantum non - markovianity are evidenced by the large number of quantum non - markovianity measures and witnesses presented in the literature .",
    "these are based , for example , on the divisibility of the dynamical map  @xcite , distinguishability of quantum states  @xcite , quantum fisher information  @xcite , quantum mutual information  @xcite , volume of dynamically accessible states  @xcite , nonunitality of the dynamical map  @xcite , quantum channel capacity  @xcite , @xmath1-divisibility  @xcite , and the quantum regression theorem  @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used non - markovianity measures appear to be those based on the divisibility  @xcite and distinguishability  @xcite . in some special cases",
    "these give the same criterion for non - markovianity , but it is known that in general the divisibility measure provides a more sensitive probe of non - markovian dynamics than the distinguishability measure  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the distinguishability measure requires an optimization over pairs of initial states .",
    "although this optimization can be simplified by choosing the initial pairs to be orthogonal states on the boundary of the state space  @xcite , it nevertheless is a time - consuming task that includes the possibility of not finding the optimal ( or even close to optimal ) initial state pair .",
    "the calculation of the divisibility measure , on the other hand , does not require any optimization procedure .",
    "if the master equation is known , the value of the divisibility measure of an @xmath0-level system can be given in terms of the eigenvalues of an @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the eigenvalues is fast even for a rather large @xmath0 , but their analytical calculation is in general impossible if the system has more than two levels .    in this paper , we address these issues by deriving an upper bound for the distinguishability - based measure of a two - level system and a lower bound for the divisibility - based measure of an @xmath0-level system . the upper bound can be calculated without the need to optimize over intial state pairs .",
    "moreover , for some master equations the actual value of the distinguishability measure reaches the upper bound .",
    "the lower bound for the divisibility measure , on the other hand , can be obtained analytically regardless of the dimension of the system and provides a sufficient condition for the dynamical map to be nondivisible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_me ] , we present the general form of the master equation of a two - level system and and introduce the canonical form of the master equation of an @xmath0-level system . in sec .",
    "[ sec_trace ] , we define the distinguishability - based non - markovianity measure , derive an upper bound for it in the two - level case , and prove that for certain master equations the exact value of the measure equals the upper bound . in sec .",
    "[ sec_divisibility ] , we introduce the divisibility - based non - markovianity measure and obtain a lower bound for it . in the case of a two - level system , the lower bound highlights the importance of the so - called drift vector in making the dynamics non - markovian .",
    "we give examples of applications of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec_examples ] , concentrating on the spin  boson model .",
    "we show that in this system the differences between the two measures can be attributed to the drift vector .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in sec .  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "we first consider the differential equation governing the time evolution of a two - level system .",

    "as @xmath24 is a basis of @xmath25 , @xmath26 is uniquely determined by defining its action on these matrices .",
    "using eq .  , we find that @xmath27 for the map @xmath26 to describe physically well - defined time evolution , it has to be trace preserving and completely positive ( cp ) . from eqs .   and",

    "we assume that the master equation is such that @xmath26 is also cp for any @xmath28 . in the example including numerical studies on the spin  boson model we check for the complete positivity of @xmath26 explicitly .",
