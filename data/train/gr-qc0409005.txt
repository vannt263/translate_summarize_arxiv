    "alternative gravity theories in higher dimensions have been attracting considerable attention , particularly the einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) theory , which emerges as the low energy limit of string theory .",
    "the egb lagrangian is a linear combination of euler densities continued from lower dimensions .",
    "it gives equations involving up to second order derivatives of the metric , and has the same degrees of freedom as ordinary einstein theory .",
    "a particular choice of the coefficients in front of the euler densities gives theories where the local lorentz symmetry is enlarged to a local @xmath5 symmetry @xcite .",
    "interesting solutions to the egb equations , many of them relevant to the development of the @xmath6 correspondence @xcite , include a variety of black holes in asymptotically euclidean or @xmath5 spacetimes .",
    "these solutions could be found mostly because they are highly symmetric . analyzing their linear stability",
    ", however , confronts us with the high complexity of the egb equations , since the perturbative terms break the simplifying symmetries of the background metric . in this letter",
    "we report on the stability of spherically symmetric , static solutions of the quadratic egb theory .",
    "these are preliminary results of ongoing work on the stability of egb black holes with arbitrary einstein manifolds as horizons @xcite",

    "these are the first in a tower @xmath12 of tensors of order @xmath13 in @xmath14 constructed by lovelock @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the most general rank two , divergence free symmetric tensor that can be constructed out of the metric and its first two derivatives in a spacetime of dimension @xmath15 , is a linear combination of the @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "+ here we consider the spherically symmetric case , a spacetime of dimension @xmath18 with metric @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the line element of the unit @xmath21dimensional sphere @xmath22 .",
    "we use indices @xmath23 and a bar for tensors and operators on @xmath22 , whereas @xmath24 are generic indices .",
    "the nonzero components of the riemann tensor of the metric ( [ bh ] ) are @xmath25 inserting ( [ rie ] ) in ( [ lovelock ] ) we find that ( [ bh ] ) solves the egb equation if @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfies @xcite @xmath28 we consider _ tensor _ perturbations around ( [ bh ] ) @xmath29 which are those satisfying @xmath30 unless @xmath31 .",
    "tensor perturbations are believed to be the only potentially unstable modes in ordinary einstein theory @xcite .",
    "we choose the gauge where @xmath32 is transverse traceless .",
    "this is easily seen to imply that the restriction of @xmath32 to the sphere is transverse traceless , and so can be expanded using a basis of eigentensors of the laplacian @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , a negative eigenvalue ( @xmath49 signals the possibility of an instability that requires also consideration of the normalization of the corresponding eigenfunctions ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) .    the explicit form of the potential @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 and the parameters of the theory is rather lengthy .",

    "we analyze briefly the case @xmath56 for general @xmath57 , and also the @xmath58 and @xmath59 btz black holes @xcite .",

    "is positive definite in all cases , while , a long computation shows that the first and third terms are also positive definite for @xmath69 , for @xmath70 and all @xmath71 , so all these cases are stable under tensor perturbations .",
    "the @xmath59 case is exceptional .",
    "here we notice that , since @xmath72 is bounded in @xmath73 , with @xmath74 for @xmath75 , a sufficient condition for the existence of a bound state of negative energy is @xcite , @xmath76 this can be written as an integral over @xmath51 , @xmath77 the second term on the right in ( [ v1 ] ) , divided by @xmath78 , is positive , while the third , divided by @xmath60 , is a total derivative in @xmath51 , and gives a vanishing contribution on account of its behaviour for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as is easily seen from ( [ k ] ) .",
    "the `` dangerous '' contribution comes then from @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath82 contains the ( positive ) factor @xmath83 , which can be arbitrarily large for spherical horizons , while the other terms in ( [ v1 ] ) are independent of @xmath84 , the condition , @xmath85 implies that ( [ coso1 ] ) will be satisfied for a sufficiently large @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath86 has dimension @xmath87 and that for @xmath59 , @xmath88 has dimension @xmath89 .",

    "figure 1.a shows the potential corresponding to a small @xmath88 case where ( [ coso1 ] ) holds , whereas figure 1.b shows the potential of a large @xmath88 solution .",
    "this is positive definite and therefore does not allow bound states .",
    "+ in closing this section we remark that , in space time dimensions @xmath104 and @xmath105 , egb black holes with a cosmological constant contain as particular cases the corresponding btz black holes @xcite . in the notation of this letter and that of @xcite we have , @xmath106    interestingly , we find that all @xmath104 solutions are stable , while _ all _ solutions are unstable for @xmath105 .",

    "@xmath59 we found the unexpected result that the egb black holes are stable only for sufficiently large mass .",
