    "the physics of josephson junctions arrays ( jja ) has been a subject of significant interest in the last ten years @xcite . a large number of studies , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite have been devoted to them .",
    "initially , part of the interest in jja came from their close relation to one of the most extensively studied theoretical spin models , i.e. the classical 2-d xy model for which jja give a concrete experimental realization .",
    "in non - dissipative jja the two main contributions to the energy are the josephson coupling between superconducting islands due to cooper pair tunneling , and the electrostatic energy arising from local deviations from charge neutrality . in the initial experimental studies ,",
    "the size of the islands was large enough so that the charging energy contributions were very small , thus making the arrays behavior effectively semi - classical .",
    "recent advances in submicron technology have made it possible to fabricate relatively large arrays of ultrasmall superconducting islands separated by insulating barriers .",
    "these islands can have areas of the order of a few @xmath10 , with self capacitances @xmath11 ff , and nearest neighbors mutual capacitance @xmath12 ff @xcite .",
    "note that the mutual capacitance can be at least two orders of magnitude larger than the self capacitance .",
    "therefore , these arrays have charging energy contributions , @xmath13 , large enough so that quantum fluctuation effects are of paramount importance . in the delft @xcite and harvard @xcite experiments ,",
    "the island sizes were kept constant , while varying the normal state junction resistance , which in turn changes the josephson coupling energy , @xmath0 .",
    "this allows one to obtain arrays with values of the quantum parameter @xmath14 in the range [ 0.134.55 ] @xcite , or values as high as 33 @xcite . in this equation",
    "we have used the definition of charging energy , @xmath15 the experimental systems can be modeled by a quantum generalization of the classical xy model , because the phase of the order parameter associated with each one of the islands is canonically conjugate to its excess cooper pair number .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath16 determines the relevance of the quantum fluctuations . for small @xmath16 the quantum fluctuations of the phases are small and",
    "the system is well modeled by a renormalized classical 2-d xy model .",
    "the nature of the phase transition in the classical 2-d xy model is well understood , whereas in its quantum mechanical generalization there still are unsettled issues .",
    "one of the most notorious of these is the possibility of having a low temperature instability of the superconducting state .",
    "a possible reentrant transition was originally found within a mean field theory treatment of the self - capacitive xy model @xcite .",
    "an explicit two - dimensional study of the self - capacitative xy model , within a wkb renormalization group ( wkb - rg ) analysis also found evidence of a low temperature reentrant instability , triggered by a quantum fluctuation induced proliferation of vortices @xcite .",
    "recently , kim and choi have studied the quantum induced fluctuations in these arrays , using a variational method @xcite .",
    "they found that there is a range of values of the ratio of charging to josephson energy , for which there is a low temperature reentrance from a superconducting to a normal state .",
    "similar results had been obtained by simanek , also using a variational calculation , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a non - perturbative quantum monte carlo study of the self - capacitive model found a low temperature transition , but between two superconducting states @xcite . the fully frustrated version of this model was also studied by quantum qmc and it yielded a larger jump discontinuity in the superfluid density as compared to the one in zero field as well as the critical temperature one order of magnitude higher @xcite . a more recent analysis of the wkb - rg analysis has shown that , to lowest order in the quantum fluctuations , it must have the same critical temperature for a quantum induced phase transition ( quit ) @xcite . a recent qmc study of the fully frustrated self - capacitive model by mikalopas et al .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the unusually large jump in the superfluid density is dominated by metastability effects due to the particular nature of the excitations in the frustrated model .",
    "this result is in agreement then with the reanalysis of the rg equations .",
    "however , this study was carried out at relatively high temperatures and the question about the existence of a quit , both in the frustrated and unfrustrated cases remains open .",
    "we deal extensively with the later question here .",
    "other studies find within mft that to have reentrance it is necessary to include off - diagonal capacitances @xcite , while others do not agree with this finding @xcite .",
    "the search for a reentrant type transition is encouraged by some evidence of low temperature instabilities found experimentally in arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , ultrathin amorphous films @xcite , a multiphase high-@xmath17 system @xcite , and in granular superconductors @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies have been carried out using the self - capacitive model and different kinds of mft or self consistent harmonic approximations ( scha)@xcite . as already mentioned , these studies do not agree among each other on some of the properties of the phase diagram , in particular about the possible existence of a low temperature instability of the superconducting state .",
    "no study has been carried out that closely represents the experimental systems where both the self and mutual capacitances are explicitly included .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consider a model that is expected to represent the characteristics of the delft experiments .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on calculating the phase diagram using different theoretical tools",
    ".    one of the main results of this paper is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01-phase - diagram ] which shows the @xmath16 vs. @xmath18 phase diagram for an array with @xmath19 both for the unfrustrated ( @xmath20 ) and fully frustrated ( @xmath21 ) cases .",
    "the left hand side of this diagram shows the superconducting to normal phase boundary ( s  n ) as data points with error bars joined by a continuous line .",
    "these data points were calculated using a qmc method , to be described later in the paper .",
    "we also show ( as squares ) the experimental results taken from refs .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath20 at small values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the theoretical and experimental results agree quantitatively quite well with each other and with the semiclassical wkb - rg approximation . on the other hand",
    ", they only qualitatively agree for the @xmath21 case and on the superconducting to insulating phase boundary . the normal to insulating transition line",
    "is shown to the right of the phase diagram .",
    "the latter is just a tentative boundary since our numerical calculations were not reliable enough to give the definitive location of this line , as also happens in experiments .",
    "the error bars in the calculated points used to draw the n - i line represent a crude estimation of the region where the inverse dielectric constant is different from zero .",
    "however , the issue of convergence of the calculation to the path integral limit is not resolved by these error bars . as we will explain in the main body of the paper we found further evidence for a low temperature instability of the superconducting state in our numerical calculations .",
    "we found that this instability depends strongly on the magnitude of @xmath16 and the finite size of the imaginary time axis in the qmc calculations .",
    "the latter finding sets strict constraints on some of the reentrant type behavior found in previous theoretical studies .",
    "other studies have found reentrance very close to the superconducting to insulating transition @xcite .",
    "this possibility is harder to study from our monte carlo calculations .",
    "the physical content of the phase diagram is generally understood in terms of the interplay between the josephson and charging energies . for small @xmath16 and high temperature the spectrum of excitations",
    "is dominated by thermally excited vortices , which drive the superconducting to normal transition as the temperature increases , while the charging energy contributes with weak quantum fluctuations of the phases .",
    "the latter produces , after averaging over the quantum fluctuations , an effective classical action with a renormalized josephson coupling that lowers the critical temperature @xcite .    for large @xmath16 and low temperatures the charging energy dominates .",
    "the excitations in this limit are due to the thermally assisted cooper pair tunneling that produces charged polarized islands . at low temperatures , there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the electrostatic coulomb blockade so that the cooper pairs are localized and the array is insulating . as the temperature increases , the electric dipole excitations can unbind , driving an insulating to conducting transition ( i  c ) . in the limit @xmath22",
    ", it was suggested that the i - c transition could be of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , for in this case the interaction between charges is essentially logarithmic @xcite .",
    "however , for the experimental samples it has been shown that rather than a true phase transition what is measured appears to be a crossover between an insulating to conducting phase , characterized by thermally activated processes @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the reason for the crossover is the short screening length present in the samples ( @xmath23 lattice sites ) .",
    "both experimental groups @xcite find that a simple energetic argument gives an explanation for the activation energy found in the experiments .",
    "furthermore , the nature of this crossover may be linked to thermal as well as to dynamical effects .",
    "as we shall see , theoretically the i - n phase is hard to study in detail .    for large values of @xmath16",
    "the model can be approximated by a 2-d lattice coulomb gas , where a perturbative expansion can be carried out using @xmath0 as a small parameter .",
    "this type of calculation was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "the analysis lead to a 2-d coulomb gas with a renormalized coupling constant . here",
    "we will extend this calculation to obtain a more accurate estimation of the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "we do this because we are interested in seeing if it is possible to have a quit instability in the low temperature insulating phase .",
    "this possibility is suggested by the dual symmetry of the effective action between charges and vortices found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the fact that the @xmath16 perturbative expansion shows a low temperature quit instability in the superconducting phase .",
    "we find that the results of a first order expansion in @xmath25 does not present this type of low temperature instability .    among the most interesting regions of the phase diagram",
    "is when the josephson and charging energies are comparable . for this nonperturbative case , using a path integral formulation and the villain approximation @xcite , an effective action for logarithmically interacting charges and vortices was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case where @xmath24 .",
    "the action of the two coulomb gases shows an almost dual symmetry , so that at an intermediate value of @xmath16 , both the s",
    " n and the i ",
    "c transitions converge to a single point as @xmath26 .",
    "a similar picture was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using a short range electrostatic interaction and a mean field renormalization group calculation . a nonperturbative calculation is needed to determine the actual shape of the phase diagram in this region .",
    "we further discuss this point in the main body of the paper .",
    "it has been argued that at @xmath27 the self - capacitive model is in the same universality class as the 3-d xy model @xcite , where the ratio @xmath28 would play the role of temperature .",
    "this analogy would result in a transition at some finite value of @xmath29 from a superconducting to an insulating phase . moreover",
    ", there should be a marked signature in the nature of the correlation functions when crossing over from a 2-d xy model at high temperatures to a 3-d xy model as @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath30 , the correlation functions decay algebraically in the critical region , with a temperature dependent exponent . at t=0 and @xmath31",
    "there is a single critical point at @xmath32 , so that the correlations decay exponentially above and below @xmath33 , and algebraically at @xmath32 .",
    "the question is then , how do we go from algebraic to exponential correlations as t changes ?",
    "this can only happen by having a change of analyticity in the correlations , thus the possibility of having a quit in the self - capacitive model .",
    "the situation is different in the mutual - capacitance dominated limit , of experimental interest .",
    "when @xmath34 the model is equivalent to having two interacting lattice coulomb lattice gas models .",
    "the general critical properties of this case are not fully understood at present .",
    "a further complication arises when @xmath35 is small but non - zero .",
    "the map to a higher dimensional known model does not work in this case , and the problem has to be studied on its own right . because of the essential differences between the self - capacitive and the mutual - capacitance dominated models one can not just take results from one case and apply them to the other .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to explicitly study the mutual capacitance dominated model , but with nonzero @xmath35 .",
    "a brief report on some of the results of this paper has appeared elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : model ] we define the model studied and derive the path integral formulation of the partition function used in our calculations . in section [ sec : wkb - rg ] we present a derivation of the path integral used in the semiclassical analysis , in the limit where the josephson energy dominates .",
    "we carry out a wkb expansion up to first order in @xmath16 , finding an effective classical action where the charging energy contributions are taken into account as a renormalization of the josephson coupling . in section [ subsec : rg ] we find general renormalization group ( rg ) equations from which we obtain the phase diagram for small @xmath16 . in section [ sec : insulating - normal ] we study the large @xmath16 limit , in which the charging energy is dominant over the josephson energy .",

    "if the coherence length of the cooper pairs is larger than the size of the islands , we can assume that the phase of the order parameter is constant in each island .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the order parameter is expected to have small fluctuations about an electrically neutral island and can then be taken as constant trough the array .",

    "<S> we present results from an extensive analytic and numerical study of a two - dimensional model of a square array of ultrasmall josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we include the ultrasmall self and mutual capacitances of the junctions , for the same parameter ranges as those produced in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the model hamiltonian studied includes the josephson , @xmath0 , as well as the charging , @xmath1 , energies between superconducting islands . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding quantum partition function is expressed in different calculationally convenient ways within its path - integral representation . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is analytically studied using a wkb renormalization group ( wkb - rg ) plus a self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) analysis , together with non - perturbative quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> most of the results presented here pertain to the superconductor to normal ( s - n ) region , although some results for the insulating to normal ( i - n ) region are also included . </S>",
    "<S> we find very good agreement between the wkb - rg and qmc results when compared to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> to fit the data , we only used the experimentally determined capacitances as fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the wkb - rg analysis in the s - n region predicts a low temperature instability i.e. a quantum induced transition ( quit ) . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully analyze the possible existence of the quit via the qmc simulations and carry out a finite size analysis of @xmath2 as a function of the magnitude of imaginary time axis @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for some relatively large values of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , the @xmath6 limit does appear to give a _ non - zero _ @xmath2 , while for @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the scha to analytically understand the @xmath3 dependence of the qmc results with good agreement between them . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also carried out a wkb - rg analysis in the i - n region and found no evidence of a low temperature quit , up to lowest order in @xmath9 . </S>"
