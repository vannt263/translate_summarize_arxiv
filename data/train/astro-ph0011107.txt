    "the problem of the maximum possible mass of neutron stars has a long history .",
    "baade and zwicky in 1934 proposed a star composed of densely packed neutrons as the final state resulting from the supernova process @xcite .",
    "oppenheimer and volkoff in 1939 demonstrated a star composed of noninteracting neutrons is supported against gravitational collapse to a black hole by the fermi degeneracy pressure only for stellar masses up to 0.72 solar masses ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the first pulsar in 1967 and the realization pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars triggered substantial theoretical work towards understanding the structure of neutron stars .",
    "pulsar masses can be measured from observations of doppler shifts of periodic emissions from neutron stars in binary systems .",
    "some 20 radio pulsar masses have been accurately determined so far , with most masses clustering around 1.4 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is well beyond the value of 0.72 @xmath0 computed for noninteracting neutrons , so the short - range repulsion of the strong nuclear force must make a substantial contribution to the pressure supporting neutron stars against gravitational collapse .",
    "there is also evidence for neutron stars with substantially larger masses than the radio pulsars due to accretion of matter from a binary companion .",
    "the mass of the x - ray pulsar in the vela x-1 binary has been estimated to be 1.9 @xmath0 @xcite , and the x - ray burster cygnus x-2 has been determined to be 1.8 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic oscillations in the x - ray emissions from neutron stars accreting matter from low mass companions have been argued to imply a mass of up to 2.3 @xmath0 for the neutron stars in these systems @xcite .",
    "an accurate theoretical determination of the maximum possible mass of neutron stars is of practical interest for identifying as a black hole any compact object with a larger mass .",
    "the maximum mass value remains uncertain because the equation of state of neutron star matter is not well understood at the high density values found in neutron star interiors .",
    "modern methods develop the equation of state by fitting experimental nucleon - nucleon scattering data and properties of light nuclei to two and three - body interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "confidence in the results of these methods is high near normal nuclear density ( energy density = 152 mev/@xmath1 = 2.7 x 10@xmath2 g/@xmath3 , baryon density = 0.16 @xmath4 ) because , at low density , experimental verification is possible with existing facilities .",
    "the validity of extrapolating the experimentally verified low density equation of state to high density , or as an alternative theoretically modeling the physical processes thought to occur at high density , is uncertain because of the lack of high density laboratory data .",
    "the sources of the uncertainties in the high density equation of state are incomplete knowledge of the three - nucleon interactions , the contributions of mesonic and other baryonic besides nucleonic degrees of freedom , and a possible quark deconfinement transition @xcite .    in light of these uncertainties in the exact form of the high density equation of state",
    ", several authors have derived an upper limit on the maximum neutron star mass using only general restrictions on the equation of state .",
    "oppenheimer and volkoff suggested @xcite , and rhoades and ruffini rigorously proved @xcite , the maximum mass of a stable neutron star results when the stiffest equation of state compatible with thermodynamic stability and causality is used .",
    "rhoades and ruffini derived an upper limit on the maximum neutron star mass of 3.2 @xmath0 by using the experimentally verified harrison - wheeler equation of state @xcite up to 1.7 times normal nuclear energy density , and the stiffest equation of state compatible with causality at high density .",
    "they defined a casual equation of state to be one having an adiabatic sound speed less than the speed of light , so they took the most incompressible equation of state to have the sound speed equal to light speed .",
    "kalogera and baym @xcite updated the result of rhoades and ruffini , using an equation of state developed by wiringa , fiks , and fabrocini @xcite up to twice normal nuclear energy density .",
    "they derived an upper mass limit of 2.9 @xmath0 using the same maximally incompressible equation of state as rhoades and ruffini above twice normal nuclear energy density .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply insights from relativistic kinetic theory to the problem of the maximum possible mass of neutron stars .",
    "kinetic theory used to model viscosity and heat conduction shows requiring the sound speed to be less than the speed of light is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality .",
    "the equation of state must satisfy a set of constraining conditions for the fluid to have stable equilibrium states with perturbations from equilbrium that propagate causally via a system of hyperbolic equations @xcite .",
    "if any one of these constraints is violated , there will be at least one fluid mode with a superluminal propagation speed .",
    "in particular , it is possible for the fluid to be acausal in a transverse mode or a different longitudinal mode even though the sound speed is below light speed .",
    "these constraints generally fix the stiffest possible equation of state to have an adiabatic sound speed significantly less than the speed of light .",
    "the main result of the present paper is application of these constraints to neutron star matter at high density softens the maximally incompressible equation of state and reduces the maximum neutron star mass significantly below the value found using a high density equation of state having the adiabatic sound speed equal to the speed of light . in the next section",
    "the thermodynamic constraint conditions from relativistic kinetic theory are reviewed .",
    "then the maximally incompressible equation of state of neutron star matter is developed from these constraint conditions .",
    "finally , neutron star models are constructed using this stiffest possible equation of state at high density , and the resulting maximum neutron star mass is determined .",
    "gravitational units having @xmath5 are used .",
    "the influences of dissipation in the form of bulk and shear viscosity and thermal conductivity in neutron star matter are modeled here using relativistic kinetic theory based on the grad method of moments @xcite as developed by israel and stewart @xcite .",

    "as was noted by kalogera and baym @xcite , once nuclear physics advances to where the experimentally based equation of state is verified up to four times normal nuclear density , the maximum neutron star mass problem will be solved .",
    "the principal finding of this paper is stability and causality constraints resulting from applying kinetic theory to thermal and viscous dissipative processes in neutron star matter yields a softer maximally incompressible equation of state , and a lower maximum mass of neutron stars , than for the sound speed equal to light speed maximally incompressible equation of state .",
    "the reduction in the maximum mass averages from 2.93 @xmath0 down to 2.64 @xmath0 for the three low density equations of state considered if the low density equation of state is regarded as experimentally verified up to twice normal nuclear energy density .",
    "the softening of the maximally incompressible equation of state is a generic prediction of kinetic theory , but the specific value of the resulting maximum neutron star mass derived here rests upon the accuracy of approximating the relaxation times and viscous - thermal couplings with their noninteracting degenerate fermi gas forms , and the overall validity of dissipative relativistic kinetic theory for strongly interacting nuclear matter at high density .",
    "future data from the relativistic heavy ion collider holds promise for experimental testing of the applicability of the kinetic theory approach to modeling high density nuclear matter .",
    "only static neutron star mass models have been constructed in this paper .",
    "rotation can support larger mass stars against collapse , but only for stars rotating rapidly enough to be nearly shedding mass from the equator is the maximum mass value significantly changed from its nonrotating value . for these rapidly rotating stars",
    "the increase in the maximum mass is at most approximately 20% over the static value when undergoing uniform rotation @xcite .",
    "differential rotation is strongly damped @xcite .",
    "the remnant of binary neutron star coalescence may undergo a short period of dynamically stable differential rotation , and thus briefly support a much larger mass neutron star remnant against prompt black hole collapse than is possible for a static or uniformly rotating star @xcite .",
