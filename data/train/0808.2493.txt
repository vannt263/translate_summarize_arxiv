    "observational constraints on galaxy density profiles and shapes can be used to study a great variety of problems , from basic cosmology to the connections between dark matter and baryons .",
    "for example , the spherically - averaged form of the dark matter halo density profile , and the distribution of halo shapes , both depend on cosmological parameters to the extent that those parameters affect the process of structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and on the physics of galaxy formation to the extent that baryons modify the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while there is still some disagreement in the literature about the theoretical predictions , even among those papers cited above , one key result is that there is considerable scatter in both the density profiles and shapes of dark matter halos , which presumably reflects different formation histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several observational tools have been used to constrain the density profiles and shapes of galaxies , at different length and mass scales , and redshifts .",
    "the main tools we consider are gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics .",
    "x - ray data are also useful for understanding the density profiles and shapes of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters , but are beyond the scope of our investigation .",
    "gravitational lensing is the deflection of light from distant sources by the gravitational fields of intervening lens galaxies .",
    "strong lensing occurs in the central regions of galaxies ( and clusters ) where the light bending is extreme enough to produce multiple images of a background source .",
    "it can be used to study the mass distributions of individual galaxies on projected scales of typically several kpc ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "weak lensing is a complementary phenomenon in which the deflection of light slightly distorts the shapes of background sources without creating multiple images ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "weak lensing probes galaxy mass distributions on scales from tens of kpc out to about 10 mpc , but only yields constraints on ensemble averages , since currently weak lensing by galaxies can only be detected by stacking many lens galaxies . while galaxy clusters can by studied on an individual basis using weak lensing , our focus is on galaxies .",
    "high - quality ( two - dimensional ) data on the kinematics of stars as well as gas in the inner parts ( a few to ten kpc ) of galaxies are now readily available , thanks in particular to strong progress in integral - field spectroscopy in the last decade .",
    "kinematics in the outer parts of late - type galaxies can often be observed from the presence of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the outer parts of early - type galaxies",
    ", however , cold gas is scarce ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we are left with discrete kinematic tracers such as planetary nebulae and globular cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) out to tens of kpc .",
    "current and upcoming wide and deep photometric surveys will reveal a vast number of strong lensing events ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and will also allow for extensive , complementary weak lensing analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , there is a rapid increase in the availability of two - dimensional kinematics of galaxies nearby ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and even at high(er ) redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these data sets , individually as well as combined , may provide strong constraints on galaxy density profiles and shapes , but the analyses involved are subject to selection and modelling biases .",
    "if we want to use strong lensing and kinematics to make robust tests of cosmological predictions , we need to answer two questions : can strong lensing and kinematic analyses yield accurate constraints on galaxy density profiles ?",
    "are the galaxies in which we can make the measurements ( especially in the case of strong lensing ) representative of all galaxies ?",
    "we refer to these two concerns as _ modelling biases _ and _ selection biases _ , respectively",
    ".    the question of selection bias is particularly important given the diversity in the galaxy population .",
    "it is well known that strong lensing favours early - type over late - type galaxies , and massive galaxies over dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but even within the population of massive early - type galaxies , to what extent does strong lensing favour galaxies whose dark matter halos have inner slopes that are steeper than average , or concentrations that are higher than average ?",
    "also , to what extent does strong lensing favour galaxies with particular shapes and/or orientations with respect to the line - of - sight ? to phrase these questions formally , consider some parameter @xmath0 describing the galaxy density profile or shape ( e.g. , the inner slope of the dark matter density profile ) .",
    "we need to understand how the distribution @xmath1 among strong lens galaxies compares to the underlying distribution @xmath2 for all galaxies .",
    "any analysis that includes strong lensing with some other technique used to study the same systems will suffer from strong lensing - related selection biases , since we never get to choose which systems will be a strong lens .",
    "selection biases are critical when we want to interpret constraints on lens galaxy density profiles and/or shapes from strong lensing , possibly in combination with kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in comparison with predictions from cosmological models .    on the other hand",
    ", modelling biases may occur because of ( often unavoidable ) assumptions made when analysing gravitational lensing and/or kinematic data because of the finite number of constraints available from the data .",
    "since galaxies are in general non - spherical , we can only correctly interpret the observations if we know the viewing direction , and even then the deprojection might not be unique ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , strong lensing is subject to the so - called mass - sheet degeneracy : part of the deflection and magnification of the light from the background source can be due to mass along the line - of - sight that is not associated with the lens galaxy itself .",
    "in addition , the constraints from strong lensing on the galaxy density are typically limited in radius to around the einstein radius , and even then , without secure , unaffected measurements of the flux of the lensing images , the density profile is difficult to recover .",
    "kinematics can be obtained over a larger radial extent , but in particular stellar kinematics suffer from the so - called mass - anisotropy degeneracy : a change in the measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion can be due to a change in total mass , but may also be the result of velocity anisotropy .    in a series of papers , we are developing a pipeline for using realistic galaxy models to simulate strong lensing and kinematic data , and assess how both selection and modelling biases affect typical strong lensing and kinematic analyses .",
    "in this first paper , we present the simulation pipeline for point - source lensing .",
    "we focus on strong lensing of quasars by early - type , central galaxies at different mass scales , using two - component mass profiles ( dark matter plus stellar component ) that are consistent with existing photometry and stacked weak lensing data from sdss @xcite , @xmath3-body , and hydrodynamic simulations . in @xcite ( @xcite ,",
    "hereafter paper  ii ) , we use this pipeline to study selection biases in strong lensing surveys . in future work",
    "we will address modelling biases in strong lensing and kinematics ( both when studied separately and when combined ) .",
    "our overall goal is to determine how strong lensing , kinematics , and possibly other probes ( weak lensing , and x - ray data for cluster mass scales ) can be used to obtain robust , unbiased constraints on galaxy density profiles and shapes .    to make our presentation coherent , and to clarify our notation and terminology , we first review the analytic treatment of ellipsoidal mass distributions with different profiles and shapes ( section  [ s : profiles - shapes ] ) , and the basic theory of strong lensing ( section  [ s : stronglensing ] ) .",
    "we then describe our simulation pipeline for point - source lensing in depth . in section  [ s : galmodels ] we present our choices for the masses , profiles , and shapes of the galaxy models . in section  [ s : lensingcalc ]",
    "we discuss the numerical methods we use for lensing calculations , including numerous tests .",
    "a summary of the simulation pipeline , and some implications for strong lensing analyses are given in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe our treatment of galaxy density profiles and shapes .",
    "while our approach is fairly conventional , it is important to present it carefully to clarify our notation and terminology , collect useful technical results , and provide a firm foundation for the work in this series of papers .",
    "this section focuses on the formal framework ; the specific galaxy models used in our simulations are discussed in section  [ s : galmodels ] .",

    "subscripts `` dm '' and `` @xmath20 '' are used to indicate whether a quantity describes the dark matter or stellar component of the galaxy model .",
    "any gas component that has not cooled to form stars  which is expected to be subdominant relative to the stellar component for early type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  is implicitly included in the component that we label dark matter .",
    "we consider mass density distributions @xmath21 that are constant on ellipsoids @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the major semi - axis length @xmath15 is a scale parameter , whereas the intermediate - over - major ( @xmath24 ) and minor - over - major ( @xmath25 ) axis ratios determine the shape . in the oblate or prolate axisymmetric limit",

    "it is most easily seen by exchanging @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( @xmath39 ) , so that the @xmath8-axis is again the symmetry axis ( instead of the @xmath0-axis ) . ] but for a triaxial galaxy model the @xmath33-axis is misaligned by an angle @xmath40 $ ] such that ( cf .",

    "we consider two families of density profiles , motivated by both observations and simulations of galaxies .",
    "historically , there has been considerable interest in cusped density profiles that have a shallower power - law at small radii and a steeper power - law at large radii , with a smooth transition in between .",
    "this family includes the @xcite profile that is commonly used to model the stellar components of early - type galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges , along with ( generalised ) nfw @xcite profiles often used to describe the dark matter profiles of simulated galaxies .",
    "an alternative , observationally motivated family of models is obtained by deprojecting the @xcite profile that is known to give a good fit to the surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges .",
    "there have been claims that deprojected srsic profiles actually provide a better fit to simulated dark matter halos than ( generalised ) nfw profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the mass range for these observations is about a factor two above our higher mass model .",

    "the caustics bound regions with different numbers of images ( see section  [ ss : resolution ] for examples ) .",
    "if the lens is circularly symmetric , the deflection is radial and has amplitude @xmath124 the outer or `` tangential '' critical curve corresponds to the ring image that would be produced by a source at the origin .",
    "the radius of this ring is the einstein radius @xmath125 , which is given mathematically by the solution of the equation @xmath126 .",

    "by contrast , the inner or `` radial '' critical curve has radius @xmath128 given by the solution of @xmath129 .    if the lens is non - circular , the conditions for the critical curves and caustics are more complicated , but we can still retain some concepts from the circular case .",
    "in particular , we can say that the outer / tangential critical curve is principally determined by the enclosed mass , whereas the inner / radial critical curve is determined by the slope of the deflection curve . when we map the critical curves in the lens plane to the caustics in the source plane , the arrangement of curves is inverted : the outer critical curve corresponds to the inner caustic ; while the inner critical curve corresponds to the outer caustic . ) .",
    "however , this situation is unusual , and it does not substantially alter the present discussion . ] since the outer caustic bounds the multiply - imaged region , it determines the total lensing cross - section .",
    "this means the cross - section is sensitive to the surface mass density ( in particular its logarithmic slope ) at small radii in the lens plane , which will be important to bear in mind when interpreting our results .    while a non - circular lens has non - circular critical curves , it is still occasionally useful to characterise the scale for strong lensing with a single einstein radius .",
    "we generalise the definition of the einstein radius to a non - circular lens by using the monopole deflection , or the deflection angle produced by the monopole moment of the lens galaxy , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the average convergence within radius @xmath13 , and @xmath132 are polar coordinates on the sky .",
    "the einstein radius is then given by @xmath133 , or equivalently @xmath134 .",
    "this is the definition that emerges naturally from models of non - spherical lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it matches the conventional definition in the circular case .",
    "it is instructive to think of lensing in terms of fermat s principle and say that lensed images form at stationary points of the arrival time surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the arrival time is a 2d function of angles on the sky , there are three types of stationary points : minima , maxima , and saddle points .",

    "the eigenvalues are both positive for a minimum , both negative for a maximum , and mixed for a saddle point .",
    "since our galaxies have central surface densities shallower than @xmath136 , the lensing `` odd image theorem '' applies : the total number of images must be odd , and the number of minimum , maximum , and saddle point images must satisfy the following relation @xcite : @xmath137 in practice , images at maxima are rarely observed because they form near the centres of lens galaxies and are highly demagnified ; the only secure observation of a maximum image in a galaxy - scale lens required a deep and dedicated search @xcite .",
    "we do compute maxima because they are useful in checking our numerical methods ( see section  [ ss : imgconfig ] ) , but we focus our analysis on minimum and saddle point images because they constitute the bulk of lensing astrophysics .",
    "the redshifts of the lens ( @xmath138 and source ( @xmath139 ) play an important role in determining what region of a galaxy is relevant for strong lensing . roughly speaking , strong",

    "we adopt fiducial redshifts of @xmath146 for the lens and @xmath147 for the source .",

    "our results apply equally well to any other combination of lens and source redshifts that yield @xmath149 .",
    "the reason is that if we fix the galaxy density profile and vary @xmath145 and @xmath139 so as to keep @xmath110 fixed , the strong lensing region will always have the same physical scale and hence the same relation to the density profile . if we instead vary @xmath145 and @xmath139 in a way that increases @xmath110 , that will tend to push the lensed images to smaller radii and hence make the stellar component somewhat more dominant .",
    "conversely , varying the redshifts in a way that lowers @xmath110 will tend to make the dark matter component more significant .",
    "we examine the effect of varying @xmath145 and @xmath139 on our results explicitly in subsequent papers .",
    "we note that the lens redshift also affects strong lensing in the conversion from physical to angular scales .",
    "even if the physical size of the lensing region stays fixed as we vary the source and lens redshifts , the angular separation between the lensed images will vary with @xmath145 .",
    "this may lead to _ observational _ selection effects : for example , resolution - limited surveys may miss lenses for which @xmath145 is high and the images can not be resolved , while spectroscopic surveys may miss lenses for which @xmath145 is low and the images fall outside the spectroscopic slit or fiber . however , our focus in this work is on _ physical _ selection biases in strong lensing , which means that we consider the lens and source redshifts only in terms of how they affect @xmath110 .",
    "our choice @xmath147 for the source redshift is typical of quasar lenses in the castles sample , but our choice @xmath146 places the lens galaxy on average at a smaller distance .",
    "the latter is , however , closer to the typical lens redshift in the slacs sample of galaxy / galaxy strong lenses @xcite , but those lenses are explicitly selected to have source redshifts @xmath150 @xcite . as a result , our fiducial value of @xmath110 is typically between that of castles and slacs lenses .",

    "* ) , and at smaller radii in the slacs sample ( @xmath153 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the statistics of the slacs survey are much more involved than the statistics of quasar lens surveys , because slacs lenses have extended rather than point - like sources , and the survey relies on fiber spectra from sdss .",
    "slacs lens statistics have recently been examined by @xcite , and we do not consider them explicitly in the current work .",
    "in this section we construct the galaxy models used in our simulations .",
    "we seek models with a variety of density profiles and shapes that not only are realistic but also sample the range of systematic effects in strong lensing . to that end",

    "we refer to lens models computed this way as map - based lens models , and we use them for our cusped models . with the map - based approach , since the convergence is not analytic .",
    "we opt to handle all the cusped models in the same way for uniformity . ]",
    "there are four important technical details to consider in the fourier analysis .",
    "the first issue is avoiding `` edge effects '' that may arise because we are using a rectangular box with an elliptical density map , and because ffts naturally impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we embed the @xmath109-map in a grid at least twice as large as the desired box in each direction ( and then round up to the next power of two , as required for ffts ) . we take advantage of the fact that our density models have circular or elliptical symmetry , and we know ( from newton s third law ) that the gravitational force inside an elliptical shell due to that shell is zero .",
    "we can therefore set the density to zero outside of a reference ellipse that is larger than the region where we wish to study lensing , without affecting the lensing deflections or magnifications ( or differential time delays , although we do not study those ) .",
    "specifically , if the box side length is @xmath346 , and the angle of the projected mass distribution relative to the @xmath9 axis is @xmath44 ( see also section  [ ss : ellipsoidalshapes ] and equation  [ eq : misalignment_psi ] in particular ) , we first define the axes of the projected mass distribution @xmath347 and then set @xmath109 to zero when @xmath348 the second issue arises because equation   is ill - behaved at @xmath349 .",
    "we avoid this problem by setting all fourier transforms to zero at @xmath349 . since @xmath350 , putting @xmath351 amounts to requiring that the total mass in the fft box vanish . that , in turn , means the code effectively adds a negative , uniform mass sheet to offset the positive mass in our model @xmath109-map .",
    "we can compensate by explicitly inserting a positive mass sheet to compensate for the effective negative mass sheet .",
    "we have carefully tested this approach to verify that it yields accurate lensing calculations ( see section  [ ss : validation ] ) .    as a third issue",
    ", we need to make sure our results are not affected by the resolution of the grid on which we compute @xmath109 .",
    "finally , we must necessarily work in a finite box , and we need to check that our results are not affected by the size of the box .",
    "we examine the latter two issues carefully below in sections  [ ss : resolution ] and  [ ss : boxsize ] , respectively .",
    "the gravlens  software features a general `` tiling '' algorithm to solve the lens equation and find the images of a given source ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we can check the recovered images using general considerations from lens theory .",
    "first , we classify the images as minima , maxima , and saddle points as discussed in connection with equation   in section  [ ss : lenstheory ] .",
    "we can then categorise the image configuration as follows :    * a 2-image lens has one minimum and one saddle point ( plus one maximum that we do not analyse ) . *",
    "a 3-image lens has two minima and one saddle point . *",
    "a 4-image lens has two minima and two saddle points ( plus one maximum that we do not analyse ) .",
    "note that all three cases satisfy the image number relation in equation  .",
    "recall from section  [ ss : lenstheory ] that we find but do not analyse maximum images because they are rarely observed and do not play a major role in most strong lensing applications .    according to lens theory ,",
    "these are the only viable multiply - imaged configurations that can be produced by an isolated galaxy whose central surface density is shallower than @xmath352 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , any set of recovered images that does not fall into one of these three categories must represent a numerical error .",
    "in general , the error rate in gravlens  is very low .",
    "the few errors that do occur arise from two causes , which are related to the tiling algorithm .",
    "first , when the source lies very close to the caustic , two of the images can lie so close together ( straddling the critical curve ) that they are difficult for the tiling algorithm to resolve .",
    "second , the tiling algorithm has adaptive resolution , which is valuable but presents certain challenges in regions where the resolution changes ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases checking",
    "the image configuration identifies the rare errors .",
    "there is one error that can slip past this check : if the code fails to find one saddle point of a 4-image lens , it will misclassify the system as a 3-image lens .",
    "we shall see below ( section  [ ss : projangle ] ) that this error does occur , but at a low rate that does not corrupt our results at a significant level",
    ".      our initial focus will be on understanding intrinsic selection biases in strong lensing surveys ( see paper ii ) .",
    "we therefore study lensing cross - sections with the idea that any physical effect that enhances the cross - section will be more likely to appear in lens samples , while any effect that reduces the cross - section will be disfavoured .",
    "historically , most lenses found in systematic surveys had point - like images ( quasars or radio sources ) . that is changing with the advent of surveys like slacs @xcite , but the statistics of galaxy / galaxy strong lensing are much more complicated than the statistics of point source lensing @xcite , so we currently focus on the point source case .    at the most basic level ,",
    "the lensing cross - section is just the area of the source plane that leads to multiple imaging .",
    "we call this the total cross - section ( @xmath353 ) , and subdivide it into the cross - sections for the regions that produce 2 , 3 , or 4 images ( @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 ) . in real surveys , we also need to account for the fact that brighter lensed images are easier to observe ; this `` magnification bias '' effect is discussed in section  [ ss : magbias ] .",
    "the cross - sections have dimensions of area on the sky , so the natural unit is arcsec@xmath357 .",
    "we compute the cross - sections using monte carlo techniques .",
    "we place a source at a random position behind the lens , and solve the lens equation numerically to find all the images of this mock lens .",
    "we repeat this process many times , tabulate the number of mock 2-image , 3-image , and 4-image lenses , and use the input number density of sources to compute the associated cross - sections .",
    "we find that using 5000 sources provides a good balance between run time and statistical uncertainties .",
    "the most obvious approach is to distribute sources randomly and uniformly in the smallest circle enclosing the lensing caustics in the source plane .",
    "however , this approach yields poor sampling of high - magnification systems that are rare but important , especially for magnification bias ( see section  [ ss : magbias ] ) . for an alternate approach , @xcite pointed out that picking positions randomly and uniformly in the _ image _ plane , and then mapping them to the source plane , yields a set of source positions that are random but weighted by the total magnification of all images ( see fig .",
    "[ f : mockfig ] ) .",
    "we must account for the magnification weighting in order to compute the cross - section and magnification bias properly , but that is a straightforward task . compared with uniform source sampling , magnification - weighted source sampling is no more complicated in concept or algorithm , and yields superior results for monte carlo calculations of lensing cross - sections and magnification bias .",
    "we determine the statistical errors on the cross - sections using bootstrap resampling .",
    "we create 500 resampled sets of mock lenses , and use the variance among them as the statistical uncertainty .",
    "all of this analysis ( including bootstrap resampling ) can be done with the gravlens  routine ` mockcsec ` ( new in version 1.99k ) .",
    "most lensing surveys have a flux limit that influences the statistical distribution of lenses .",
    "the fact that brighter images are easier to observe leads to a lensing `` magnification bias '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we account for this fact by computing not just the lensing cross - section itself , but the combination of cross - section and magnification bias , which we call the biased cross - section .",
    "consider a survey in which the number of sources brighter than flux @xmath358 is @xmath359 , while the survey flux limit is @xmath360 .",
    "the survey is sensitive to systems in which the intrinsic flux @xmath358 and the lensing magnification @xmath361 combine such that @xmath362 .",
    "thus , the total number of lenses found in the survey has the form of an integral over the source plane , @xmath363 this number is divided by the total number of sources to obtain the lensing probability , leading to the following definition for the biased cross - section @xcite : @xmath364 the subscript @xmath66 indicates that we can compute the biased cross - section for lenses with @xmath66 images by restricting the integral to the appropriate region in the source plane ( cf .",
    "[ f : mockfig ] ) .",
    "( note that we do not distinguish between the symbols for unbiased and biased cross - sections , because we have tried to be explicit in the subsequent text about which we are using . )",
    "the cross - section can be combined with the number density of sources to obtain the observed number of lens systems .    while magnification bias depends explicitly on the flux limit of a survey , it depends implicitly on the resolution as well . for a survey that detects lenses but does not resolve the images ( assuming they are resolved in follow - up observations ) ,",
    "the initial detection depends on the combined flux of all images , so it is the total magnification that enters equation  . for a survey that can resolve the images at the outset",

    "the individual mass components we use have axis ratios that are constant as a function of radius .",

    "<S> studies of strong gravitational lensing in current and upcoming wide and deep photometric surveys , and of stellar kinematics from ( integral - field ) spectroscopy at increasing redshifts , promise to provide valuable constraints on galaxy density profiles and shapes . however , both methods are affected by various selection and modelling biases , whch we aim to investigate in a consistent way . in this first paper in a series we develop a flexible but efficient pipeline to simulate lensing by realistic galaxy models . these galaxy models have separate stellar and dark matter components , each with a range of density profiles and shapes representative of early - type , central galaxies without significant contributions from other nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we use fourier methods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surface density distributions , and monte carlo methods to compute lensing statistics such as point - source lensing cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> incorporating a variety of magnification bias modes lets us examine different survey limitations in image resolution and flux . </S>",
    "<S> we rigorously test the numerical methods for systematic errors and sensitivity to basic assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the minimum number of viewing angles that must be sampled in order to recover accurate orientation - averaged lensing quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for a range of non - isothermal stellar and dark matter density profiles typical of elliptical galaxies , the combined density profile and corresponding lensing properties are surprisingly close to isothermal around the einstein radius . </S>",
    "<S> the converse implication is that constraints from strong lensing and/or stellar kinematics , which are indeed consistent with isothermal models near the einstein radius , can not trivially be extrapolated to smaller and larger radii </S>",
