    ". layers with other elements in the carbon group have been studied to produce counterparts to graphene , such as silicene , germanene or stanene@xcite .",
    "graphene is flat because there is _",

    "other layered nanostructures isoelectronic to graphene are obtained either combining iii - v group elements , such as in hexagonal boron nitride@xcite .",
    "2d materials research is recently widen to other new materials based on phosphorus , whose isoelectronic counterparts are a central issue nowadays@xcite .",
    "black phosphorus is formed by single layers mediated by van der waals interaction , so that analogously to graphene , few layers are isolated to form phosphorene @xcite .",
    "phosphorene has a two dimensional honeycomb puckered structure where each atom is bonded to three neighbors .",
    "it displays a direct band gap , tunable attending to the number of layers and the stacking@xcite .",
    "more and more systems are being proposed and deeply analyzed to obtain 2d materials with improved stability and new properties@xcite ; one of the hottest topic nowadays focuses on phosphorene isoelectronics compounds .",
    "there are two different approaches to obtain phosphorene isoelectronic compounds , by taking elements of the group v or by mixing elements of the groups iv - vi also called group iv monochalcogenides@xcite .",
    "the phosphorene isoelectronic compounds of the group v are nitrogene , phosphorene , arsenene@xcite and antimonene@xcite , and their binary compounds@xcite .",
    "they are currently undergoing characterization , for instance , by studying doping@xcite , point defects@xcite , and oxygen contamination@xcite .",
    "the group iv monochalcogenides includes a combination of light elements , such as in silicon monosulfide monolayers and thin films@xcite , and a combination of heavy ( ge , sn ) and light ( o , s ) atoms @xcite , such as in silicon telluride@xcite and germanium monosulfide@xcite monolayers , which exhibit strain - tunable indirect band gap .",
    "nevertheless , none of the today proposed phosphorene isoelectronic compounds is based on carbon .",
    "in fact , the layered carbon compounds , such as carbon nitride@xcite and carbon phosphide@xcite , are not isoelectronic to phosphorene .",
    "our aim is to design new layered nanostructures isoelectronic to black phosphorus , but still composed of carbon .",
    "we present here for the first time stable carbon monosulfide nanostructures covering chains , monolayers , and thin films .",
    "we have performed phonon and molecular dynamics calculations to ensure the stability of those structures at room temperature .",
    "the carbon monosulfide nanostructures vary from metallics in thin films to semiconductors in chains and most monolayers .",
    "the chains and thin films are more stable than the monolayers because sulfur atoms have two bonds instead of three ( or four ) for the monolayers @xcite . the large variety of nanostructures that we explored with either metallic or semiconductor character makes this material an interesting compound for several applications based on electronic transport within semiconductors devices .",
    "we use the siesta ( spanish initiative for electronic simulations with thousands of atoms ) package to carry out density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for carbon monosulfide nanostructures . for the exchange and correlation potentials we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the form of perdew - burke - ernzenhof@xcite .",
    "we fully relax atomic positions and unit cells until forces are below 0.006 ev /  .",
    "the used unit cells have large vectors about 24.5   in the perpendicular direction to the layers in order to avoid interaction with images .",
    "an electronic temperature of 25 mev and a meshcutoff of 250 ry are used .",
    "the sampling of the brillouin zone has a fine grid of 20@xmath420@xmath41 k points .",
    "the atomic cores are described by nonlocal norm - conserving troullier - martins@xcite pseudopotentials factorized in the kleynman - bylander form .",
    "orbitals are developed in basis sets on each atom , and the basis size is double zeta plus polarization orbitals .",
    "details on the used pseudopotentials and basis were described previously @xcite . anyhow our main results",
    "are checked by repeating calculations with the vasp code using the projected augmented wave method ( paw ) and within the pbe formalism for the exchange and correlation @xcite , and the quantum espresso method with equivalent parameters@xcite .",
    "we estimate the van der waals contribution to the total energy for a two dimensional array with well separated chains using the implementation within the vasp code@xcite of the vdw - df@xcite functional .",
    "last but not least , we even confirm the stability of such highly stable obtained structures by carrying out molecular dynamics calculations within the siesta code using the nose thermostat at room temperature .",
    "we employed a nose mass@xcite of 10 ry fs@xmath5 , and a time step of 1 fs .",
    "we have chosen 3000 as final time step and the relaxation time to reach target temperature was 2500 fs .",
    "phonon dispersion curves are obtained using the quantum espresso code , with details included in the supplemental information .",
    "we study three different types of carbon monosulfide nanostructures , monolayers , thin films , and chains arrays , following the order from lower to higher stability .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations show that thin films are not stable at room temperature .",
    "comments and analysis of thin film structures are therefore presented in the supplemental information , together with further information on monolayers and chains .",
    "we explore a wide variety of structures for carbon monosulfide monolayers .",
    "we next present the geometry and electronic structure of the four most stable structures , and finally consider the ground state in more detail .",
    "figure [ estructuras ] shows four monolayers of carbon monosulfide after structural relaxation including their relative energies .",
    "the most stable @xmath6 monolayer presents a similar structure to that of a single layer of black phosphorus .",
    "this structure has also been reported recently for group iv monochalcogenides@xcite , and group v semiconductors such as phosphorous - nitrogen or arsenic - nitrogen @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with vasp method yield energy differences slightly larger , although the stability order is the same .",
    "second in energy we find the @xmath7 monolayer that is a regular structure composed of squares looked from above .",
    "a side view reveals two different heights for sulfur atoms .",
    "next there is a similar structure , the @xmath8 structure , with all the carbon atoms shifted towards one side producing long and short distances with the sulfur atoms .",
    "when the distortion is maximized the @xmath6 structure is reached .",
    "the @xmath8 layer seems an intermediate structure between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 monolayers , so that the three monolayer monosulfide - carbon structures seems related , to be discussed at length in next section [ sec : strain ] .",
    "phonon dispersions , shown in supplemental information , indicate that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 structures are really stable , and the @xmath8 structure is unstable because there are negative frequencies .",
    "furthermore , molecular dynamics simulations show that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 structures are stable even at room temperature .",
    "last we find the @xmath9 structure which from a top view it displays a hexagonal pattern , and in a side view it has a buckled structure , reported for other phosphorene isoelectronic compounds@xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 structure is similar to that of blue phosphorene@xcite .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves show that the carbon monosulfide @xmath9 phase is unstable .        to gain insight on the electronic structure of the carbon monosulfide monolayers we consider the band structures shown in fig .",
    "[ bandas ] . on the one hand ,",
    "three of the monolayers , labeled as @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 0.97 , 0.77 and 1.64 ev , respectively . for the @xmath6 and @xmath8 layers ,",
    "the minimum of the conduction band is located at the gamma point . for the @xmath6 case ,",
    "the highest occupied valence band is well separated from lower valence bands with a pseudogap of 2 ev .",
    "the @xmath8 structure has still a pseudogap opening in the valence band , although the value is reduced to 0.5 ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 structure is metallic .",
    "the bands of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 structures appear similar because they share common structural features as commented above . for the @xmath9 monolayer",
    "the bands are degenerated throughout the brillouin zone due to the lattice symmetry .",
    "most of the features of the bands are the same for the @xmath6 and @xmath8 cases ; for instance there are two occupied bands just below the fermi energy , extended along all brillouin zone , and well separated from the deeper states . however , the band structure of the @xmath7 case differs because one of the two occupied bands close to the fermi energy becomes broad and metallized , going down to deep energies following a parabolic shape .",
    "the two occupied narrow bands for the @xmath6 and @xmath8 cases are localized within a interval of 2 ev , while the bands for the @xmath7 case become broad expanding over more than 6 ev .",
    "we find two unoccupied conduction bands that mirror the behavior of two nearest valence bands with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "there are even bands for the @xmath7 structure crossing the fermi energy , resulting in a conducting monolayer .",
    "we furthermore study the charge transfer between carbon and sulfur atoms using the mulliken scheme .",
    "the charge values are 0.81 , 0.92 , 0.65 and 0.66 electrons for the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 monolayers , respectively .",
    "we find that the charge transfer of almost one electron in some cases is large and goes from carbon to sulfur atoms .",
    "this result is surprising because carbon and sulfur have almost the same pauling electronegativity .",
    "it seems that the larger size of sulfur atoms with respect to carbon atoms must be taken into account in order to explain the charge gain by sulfur atoms .",
    "we focus on the ground state monolayer given by the @xmath6 structure .",
    "each carbon atom is bonded to three sulfur atoms and vice versa .",
    "there are two bonds of 1.82   and one of 1.90   .",
    "the angles between the bonds from a carbon atom are 113@xmath10 in two cases and 103@xmath10 in the other .",
    "it seems that carbon atoms present a sp@xmath3-like hybridization .",
    "we discuss on the relative contribution between carbon and sulfur atoms to discuss stability .",
    "the projected density of states is shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha](a ) .",
    "the total states projected on sulfur contribute more than those on carbon because sulfur has a larger number of electrons than carbon .",
    "nevertheless , the occupied peak close to the fermi energy has a larger carbon contribution than sulfur .",
    "this particular peak is related to the isolated valence band , discussed above when commenting fig .",
    "[ bandas ] .",
    "the density of states ( ldos ) in real space within the energy range of 2 ev is included in panel ( b ) .",
    "most of the states are localized around carbon atoms with orbital lobes suggesting a large @xmath11-type contribution .",
    "the peak ldos globally looks like a dangling bond of the @xmath12 hybridization .",
    "however , the wave function for the highest occupied orbital in @xmath13 point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha]c , reveals a @xmath14-like orbital over the carbon atoms , to be held responsible for the broadening of a band close to fermi energy upon distortions .",
    "the projected sulfur ldos shown in fig . [ alpha](a ) has a non negligible @xmath15 contribution , especially for the highest energy occupied peak .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 hybridization on sulfur atoms seems crucial to describe the valence band close to the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "we then compare carbon - sulfur and silicon - sulfur @xcite compounds , both being isoelectronic to phosphorene , in the @xmath6 structure .",
    "there are two well differentiated roles depending of the atom size , as shown in the @xmath6 structure of fig .",
    "[ estructuras ] .",
    "the smaller atom , either carbon for cs or sulfur for sis , is the inner one , and the larger atom is the outer one .",
    "the electronic structure produces similar trends taking into account that the inner atom contributes with @xmath14 orbitals to the highest occupied orbital at the @xmath13 point .",
    "figure [ alpha](c ) shows a @xmath17-type orbital for carbon atoms in carbon - sulfur compounds . the main contribution to",
    "the frontier orbitals in silicon - sulfur compound comes from the @xmath14 orbitals in sulfur@xcite .",
    "these bands for the outer atom project on a hybridized dangling bond .",
    "it has @xmath18 hybridization for sulfur in cs , as shown by the projected density of states in fig .",
    "[ alpha](a ) , and it has @xmath16-like hybridization for the frontier orbitals of silicon in sis @xcite . it is noteworthy that sulfur atoms can adopt the two roles depending on the counterpart element involved in the isoelectronic compound to phosphorene .          we try to shed light over the striking metallization of the @xmath7 monolayer .",
    "a distortion of the @xmath6 atomic positions could end in the @xmath7 structure , so that the monolayer could undergo a semiconductor - metal transition driven by a strain field .",
    "the @xmath7 structure is isotropic and similar to a rippled square lattice .",
    "sulfur atoms show @xmath16 hybridization as denoted by the projected density - of- states , similarly to the @xmath6 structure .",
    "a detailed analysis of the localized density of states shows that the fermi energy states are @xmath11-type on carbon , which could be seen as a square lattice of @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "details on the geometry and the projected and localized density - of - states of the @xmath7 phase are found in the supplemental information .",
    "we follow the transition between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 monolayers by changing aspect ratio , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ strain](a ) . to this aim",
    "we modify the unit cell shape step - by - step and transform the square cell into a rectangular one .",
    "the unit cell following the transformation is characterized by the aspect ratio between length and width , which is 1 for the @xmath7 phase and  1.4 for the @xmath6 phase . for each calculation",
    "the unit cell remains fixed and the inner atomic positions are relaxed .",
    "we expected that the @xmath7 monolayer changing aspect ratio would transform into the @xmath6 monolayer by relaxing the inner atomic positions .",
    "however , we find that the inner atomic structure is retained when deforming the unit cell , and the energy increases continuously with the aspect ratio , as shown in fig .",
    "[ strain](b ) .",
    "we also find a similar behavior when deforming the @xmath6 monolayer .",
    "the two curves of energy versus aspect ratio cross at a point with a barrier of about 0.2 ev between the monolayers , a fact sufficient to confirm the stability for the @xmath7 structure . the energy of the @xmath8 monolayer , included in fig .",
    "[ strain](b ) , is very close to the crossing point , which supports the idea of @xmath8 being a metastable phase between @xmath6 and @xmath7 monolayers .",
    "figure [ strain](c ) sketches a possible energy profile following this picture .",
    "we find other kind of structures for carbon monosulfide with chains arrays .",
    "the previously studied @xmath19 sis monolayer@xcite is fully relaxed by substituting silicon with carbon atoms . a layer with chains of carbon monosulfide",
    "is then stabilized by more than half electronvolt per atom when compared to the most stable @xmath6 monolayer .",
    "we obtained two different chains arrays with hexagonal and pentagonal motifs .",
    "the _ hexa _",
    "chains are more stable than the _ penta _ chains by more than 0.25 ev per atom , so we focus on the _ hexa _ chains below .",
    "the _ penta _",
    "chains are commented in the supplemental information .",
    "the structure with hexa - motif chains , shown in fig .",
    "[ chains](a ) , is 0.766 ev per atom more stable than the ground state @xmath6 monolayer , which results in a large rise of stability .",
    "the distance between the closest atoms from two different chains is larger than 3.7   , which means that interaction between adjacent chains is mediated by dispersion forces .",
    "thus , the bonds between chains are much weaker than those established within a single chain .",
    "we investigate in more detail the bonds between atoms in the chains . the top view in fig .",
    "[ chains ] ( a ) shows that due to kinks , the _ hexa _ chains combines long and short stretches .",
    "the kinked chains are more stable by an 70 mev per atom than the straight chains .",
    "we check the structural stability of this structure with chains using molecular dynamics simulation for a single chain at room temperature .",
    "carbon atoms form covalent bonds with sulfur atoms .",
    "each carbon atom is bonded to two sulfur atoms with two bond lengths of about 1.82   and to another carbon atom with a bond length of 1.38   .",
    "the short bond length between carbon atoms indicates the existence of a double bond with a @xmath20 bond and a @xmath21 bond . the @xmath21 bond is spatially shown by the highest occupied molecular orbital at the @xmath13 point in fig .",
    "[ chains](b ) , formed by two @xmath11-type orbitals from each pair of carbon atoms .",
    "concerning the angles between the three bonds , there are two different carbon atoms depending on whether they are in a short stretch or in a long stretch ; however , for all the cases the angles are close to 120@xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the three bonds are planar and form angles close to 120@xmath10 is assigned to a @xmath0 hybridization .",
    "the remaining @xmath14 orbital is used to form the double @xmath21 bond with the neighboring carbon atom .",
    "focusing now on the sulfur atoms , each atom establishes two bonds with carbon .",
    "the chain adopts a zigzag pattern with two consecutive sulfur atoms in kinks followed by other in a straight stretch .",
    "the two types of sulfur atoms seem to have the same hybridization .",
    "they contribute with @xmath11-orbitals to the highest occupied orbital at the @xmath13 point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chains](b ) . however , the kinks effect is to tilt the @xmath14 orbitals by an angle @xmath22 of approximately 25@xmath10 , as presented in fig . [ chains](b ) .",
    "the analysis of the projected density of states for the _ hexa _ chains array , attached in the supplemental information , shows that close to the fermi energy there are mainly @xmath11-type contributions , in contrast to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 monolayers .",
    "the charge reorganization under the mulliken scheme results in a net transfer of approximately 0.6 electrons from each carbon atom towards the sulfur atoms .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ chains](c ) along two directions , parallel and perpendicular to the chains .",
    "we find that the _ hexa _ chains array is semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.03 ev at the @xmath13 point , a fact that could be interesting for electronic applications .",
    "finally , we comment on the stability order between the different layered nanostructures of carbon monosulfide we have studied this far .",
    "we find chains , thin films and monolayers in order of increasing energy .",
    "the energy is explained by hybridization and the numbers of bonds for carbon and sulfur atoms in each structure , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ resumen ] .",
    "the @xmath6 monolayer , taken as reference , presents a @xmath12 hybridization for carbon atoms with three bonds and a dangling bond , and a @xmath16 hybridization for sulfur atoms with three bonds .",
    "the thin films have lower energies per atom because the carbon atoms establish a fourth bond and the sulfur atoms lost a bond .",
    "note that sulfur atoms prefer to establish two bonds to fulfill the octet rule@xcite .",
    "the thin films are unstable at room temperature in molecular simulations .",
    "last but not least , the _ hexa _ chains array improves energy and stability with respect to thin films . the gain in stability for chains is ascribed to the carbon preference for the @xmath0 hybridization with two single bonds and a double bond over the fourfold coordination of the @xmath12 hybridization in thin films .    in summary , we present brand new stable nanostructures for carbon monosulfide , which include stable chains arrays and monolayers . on the one hand , the chains arrays , which are more stable than monolayers , present hexagonal and pentagonal patterns with carbon and sulfur atoms displaying @xmath0 hybridizations .",
    "these results pave the way so that this type of nanostructures with carbon monosulfide chains can be synthesized as freestanding chains , but probably better grown supported on some substrates as chains arrays . on the other hand , the monolayers show @xmath12 and @xmath16 hybridizations for carbon and sulfur atoms , respectively .",
    "the ground state @xmath6 monolayer has the structure of a single layer of black phosphorus with an indirect band gap of approximately 1 ev .",
    "we find that strain can induce a transition between the most stable @xmath6 and @xmath7 monolayers .",
    "because the @xmath6 monolayer is semiconductor and the @xmath7 monolayer is metallic , the @xmath6 to @xmath7 transition could just allow to control conductivity by applying strain , an effect that looks promising for the design of new electronic devices .",

    "we further study the striking metallization of the @xmath7 monolayer . a distortion of the @xmath6 atomic positions could end in the @xmath7 structure , meaning that by engineering with a strain field the monolayer could undergo a semiconductor - metal transition .",

    "the presence of pentagons motivates the structure name .",
    "the distances between carbon and sulfur atoms between chains are larger than 3.5   .",
    "therefore , there are few atoms interacting through dispersion forces , which means that van der waals contribution would be lower than for the _ hexa _ motif . focusing on a single _ penta _ chain , there are two remarkable facts that explain the loss of stability with respect to the _ hexa _ chains .",
    "first , the _ penta _ motif is similar to the _ hexa _ motif with a carbon - carbon double bond rotated 90@xmath10 , so that instead of having two hexagons we have the two less stable pentagons .",
    "the double bonds are preserved with typical bond lengths between carbon atoms of 1.39   in most of the cases , and 1.45   close to a terrace .",

    "it seems that having arrays with chains formed by carbon molecules separated by sulfur atoms is crucial for having high stability with respect to monolayers .",
    "carbon group elements form buckled monolayers , such as in silicene and germanene , because @xmath12 hybridization is favored rather than @xmath0 hybridization .",
    "silicon nanostructures are expected to gain energy when higher silicon coordination is allowed , as reported for silicon monosulfide thin films@xcite .",
    "we study carbon monosulfide following the silicon monosulfide thin films structures .",
    "we find that there is a large energy gain with respect to the @xmath6 monolayer because a fourth bond is achieved for the carbon having @xmath12 hybridization . on the one hand , the most stable monolayer do not exhibit a purely carbon @xmath0 hybridization , but it has a strong @xmath12 character with a dangling bond . on the other hand ,",
    "sulfur prefers to have two bonds instead of three in order to fulfill the octet rule@xcite . consequently the energy per atom increases notably with respect to monolayers because the carbon dangling bond is passivated and a sulfur bond is lost .",

    "the coordination number , number of bonds , and distances are very similar for both structures .",
    "the difference between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 structures is the slight distortion around sulfur atoms , which requires considering a large unit cell .",

    "the sulfur angle between the two c - s bonds is 99@xmath10 .",
    "carbon atoms bind to two carbon atoms located at 1.71   and two sulfur atoms at 1.86   .",
    "the angles between bonds established by carbon atoms are all close to 109.5@xmath10 , the typical angle for an @xmath12 hybridization as for methane .",
    "the description for the @xmath28 case reveals almost identical findings .",
    "the band structures of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 structures are presented in fig .",
    "[ thinfilm ] .",
    "the electronic structure of these structures look similar as expected .",
    "however , the structural distortion of @xmath27 is splitting the degenerate bands of @xmath28 .",
    "the conduction bands close to the fermi energy expand within a broad range of more than 4 ev .",
    "we find that there is no band gap , which means the carbon monosulfide thin films are metallic .",
    "the states are metallic in the band crossing the fermi energy around the @xmath13 point and in the @xmath29 direction , regions to be held responsible for electronic conduction .    the projected density of states of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 structures shown in fig .",
    "[ thinfilm ] for both cases are similar , as expected . for carbon",
    "we distinguish three zones : an interval [ -15,-10 ] ev with @xmath30 hybridization , an interval [ -10,-4 ] with almost all the p - type contribution , and an interval [ -4,0 ] where the contribution from carbon is very small compared to that of sulfur . for sulfur there is large s - type contribution very deep in energy for the interval [ -15,-11 ] , and p - type contribution is largely predominant in energies around the fermi level . in fact , the sulfur p - type states near the fermi energy are mostly responsible for conduction .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations show that the two proposed thin films @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not stable at room temperature .",
    "the structures break into separated parts , showing preference for chain - like geometries in agreement with our results given above .",
    "the absence of a band gap for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 structures could be related to the low stability of carbon monosulfide thin films .",
    "we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations using the nose - hoover thermostat in order to study the stability of the carbon monosulfide chains , thin films , and monolayers at room temperature .",
    "we show the results for the two most stable monolayers @xmath6 and @xmath7 and for the _ hexa _ chains arrays , which are found to be stable at room temperature , in fig .",
