    "recent proper motion studies of infrared - luminous stars in the galactic center ( gc ) ( @xcite ) have convincingly demonstrated the existence of a compact @xmath20 dark mass in the dynamical center of the gc , which is located within @xmath21 of the radio source @xmath0 ( @xcite ) ( @xmath22pc at 8kpc ) .",
    "lower bounds on the compactness of this mass concentration , together with dynamical considerations , argue against the possibility of a massive cluster , and point towards a super - massive black hole as the likely alternative ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion has important implications for basic issues such as the prevalence of massive black holes in the nuclei of normal galaxies , and the nature of the accretion mechanism that makes @xmath0 so much fainter than typical active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wardle & yusef - zadeh ( 1992 ) considered several gravitational lensing effects that could be induced by a massive black hole in the gc .",
    "in particular , wardle & yusef - zadeh pointed out that gravitational lensing would occasionally lead to the amplification and splitting of the stellar images of stars which happen to move behind the black hole , and that such events would typically last from months to years , depending on the distance of such stars from the black hole .",
    "wardle & yusef - zadeh also estimated that an optical depth of order unity for such events requires an observed central surface density @xmath23 stars arcsec@xmath24 , and that this in turn would require an angular resolution of @xmath25 to individually separate the lensed images from the crowded background of faint stars .",
    "however , the photometric sensitivities and spatial resolutions required for such observations are far beyond current observational capabilities .",
    "presently , the deepest near - infrared @xmath1-band ( 2.2 @xmath2 m ) images of the central arcsec reach down to @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we will show , at this limiting magnitude the expected central surface density is @xmath27 stars arcsec@xmath24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the highest spatial resolutions obtained so far are the diffraction limited resolutions of @xmath28 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath29 ( @xcite ) achieved in the proper motion surveys .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a different possibility , namely _ microlensing _ amplification of faint stars by the central black hole .",
    "such events occur when the amplified but _ unresolved _ images of faint stars rise above the detection threshold and then fade again as such stars move behind the black hole close to the line - of - sight to @xmath0 .",
    "we present a quantitative study of such microlensing events , and we compute in detail the microlensing rates as functions of the event durations , for a wide range of assumed detection thresholds . in addition , we also consider the possible amplification of sources which lie above the detection thresholds , and we re - examine the limit in which the two lensed images can actually be resolved .",
    "our study is motivated by several recent developments .",
    "deep infrared star counts in the inner gc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and infrared and optical star counts in baade s window ( @xcite ; @xcite ) now make it possible to reliably model the infrared stellar luminosity function in the vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "the on - going proper motion monitoring campaigns of the inner few arcsec of the gc record both the positions and fluxes of individual stars in the field at a sampling rate of 12 observing runs per year . as a by - product",
    ", these measurements can be used to search for microlensing events , albeit at a low sampling rate .",
    "such events would appear as time varying sources very close to @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore intriguing that one or two variable ir sources may have already been detected close to , or coincident with , the position of @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these sources may have brightened to @xmath30 before fading from view , and appear to have varied on a timescale of @xmath16 yr .",
    "as we will argue , this behavior is consistent with the expected behavior of bright long - duration microlensing events .",
    "however , we will also argue that the probability that a single such event could have been detected during the course of the recent proper - motion monitoring campaigns is small ( @xmath17 )",
    ". the detection probabilities will increase considerably as the observational sensitivities improve ( e.g. with the advent of adaptive optics ) , and if @xmath0 is monitored more frequently than has been done so far .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ s : rate ] we set up the formalism required for our computations .",
    "some of the more technical aspects are discussed in the appendix . in  [ s : gc ] we discuss our treatment of the stellar densities , velocity fields , and @xmath1-band luminosity functions , which enter into the computation of the lensing rates .",
    "we present our results in  [ s : results ] , where we provide computations of the lensing rates as functions of the event durations for a wide range of assumed detection thresholds . in  [ s : discuss ] we present a discussion and summary .",
    "the effective size of a gravitational lens at the lens plane is set by the einstein radius , @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gravitational constant , @xmath34 is the speed of light , @xmath35 is the lens mass ( here the black hole mass ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the observer  lens and lens  source distances , respectively ( see e.g. review by bartelmann & narayan 1998 ) . we assume , as will be justified below , that @xmath38 , and define @xmath39 and @xmath40pc .",
    "the effective size of the lens at the source plane is @xmath41 .",
    "the angular size of the einstein radius , @xmath42 , is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the sun s galactocentric distance ( @xcite ) .    in our study",
    "we assume that any ir - extinction associated with an accretion disk or an ` atmosphere ' near the event horizon is negligible .",
    "we begin by showing that in our problem the stars can be treated as point sources and that the linear approximation ( small light - bending angle approximation ) holds .",
    "first , when @xmath45 , a star can be approximated as a point source as long as its radius , @xmath46 , is much smaller than @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the required amplification to observe the lensed source above the detection threshold ( see  [ s : mlrate ] ) . as we show below (",
    " [ s : plklf ] ) , the faintest stars that contribute significantly to the lensing are low - mass stars with @xmath49 cm , which require amplification factors of @xmath50 .",
    "brighter stars require progressively smaller amplification factors , down to @xmath51 , which for detection thresholds @xmath52 correspond to stars with @xmath53 cm . assuming a mean stellar mass of @xmath54 , a central mass density of @xmath55pc@xmath56 in the gc ( @xcite ) implies a mean stellar separation of @xmath57pc . even at such a small distance from the black hole , @xmath58 cm , so that the condition @xmath59 is generally satisfied for all relevant stars in the system .",
    "we thus conclude that the point source approximation holds over the entire range of interest .",
    "second , the linear approximation holds as long as the einstein radius is much larger than the schwarzschild radius of the black hole , @xmath60 , @xmath61 which even for @xmath62 is as high as @xmath63 .",
    "a point lens produces two images , one within and one outside the einstein radius .",
    "the angular separation between the two images is @xmath64 and their mean angular offset from the optical axis is @xmath65 , where @xmath65 is the angular separation between the unlensed source and the lens . as will be shown in ",
    "[ s : gc ] , @xmath66 for amplification above present - day detection thresholds in the gc , so that @xmath67 .    three angular scales in the problem",
    "determine the way the lensing will appear to the observer : the einstein angle @xmath68 , the fwhm angular resolution of the observations , @xmath69 , and the mean projected angular separation between the observed stars , @xmath70 , where @xmath11 is the detection threshold .",
    "the lensed images have to be detected against the background of a very dense stellar system .",
    "this background will be low as long as as the central surface density of observed stars , @xmath71 , is small enough so that @xmath72 .",
    "thus , for a given detection threshold , an angular resolution of at least @xmath73 is required to detect the lensed star .",
    "lower resolutions correspond to the regime of ` pixel lensing ' ( @xcite ) , which we do not consider here .    when @xmath74 , the two images will not be resolved is required to resolve the two microlensed images .",
    "the exact value of the minimal separation probably lies in the range @xmath69 to @xmath75 , and depends on the details of the procedure for faint source separation in the crowded inner @xmath76 of the gc .",
    "] , and the lensed source will appear as a _ microlensing _ event . for a given angular resolution , there is a maximal lens  source distance @xmath77 for microlensing , @xmath78 more distant stars will have @xmath79 and their two images will be separately resolved .",
    "the unresolved images of a faint star at @xmath80 close to the line of sight will appear as a ` new source ' at the position of @xmath0 , to within the observational resolution .",
    "the total source amplification , @xmath48 , is related to @xmath81 by ( @xcite ) @xmath82 and for small @xmath81 , @xmath83 .",
    "the maximal amplification along the star s trajectory is reached when its projected position is closest to the lens .",
    "a star of stellar type @xmath84 and an absolute @xmath1 magnitude @xmath85 , which is observed on a line of sight with an extinction coefficient @xmath86 and distance modulus @xmath87 , will be detected above the flux threshold @xmath11 if it is amplified by at least @xmath88 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximal impact parameter of @xmath89 . as the minimal required amplification approaches 1",
    ", @xmath90 diverges .",
    "this , and the fact that in practice the threshold is not sharply defined , leads us to introduce a cutoff at @xmath91 , which implies a minimal amplification of @xmath92 .",
    "the basic quantity that is required for predicting the lensing properties is the differential lensing rate as function of stellar type , event duration , amplification , and source distance from the black hole .",
    "we derive an explicit expression for the differential lensing rate in the appendix . here",
    "it is instructive to discuss the relations between these properties by considering the simpler case of the total lensing rate , regardless of the event duration .",
    "the total integrated rate for microlensing amplification of background stars above the detection threshold is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the inner radius of the central stellar cluster , @xmath95 the maximal radius for producing unresolved lensed images , @xmath96 is the transverse 2d stellar velocity averaged over the velocity distribution function , and @xmath97 is the total number density of stars . here and below , the notation @xmath98 designates the average of the bracketed quantity over the stellar types with @xmath99 , weighted by their fraction in the stellar population , @xmath100 , where it is assumed that @xmath100 does not depend on @xmath101 .",
    "the properties of the stellar population enter the integrated rate only through the mean impact parameter @xmath102 , which for @xmath103 is simply @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the observed ( dust extinguished ) stellar @xmath1-band flux and @xmath106 is the detection threshold flux corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "we characterize the microlensing time - scale for stars of type @xmath84 as the average time they spend _ above the detection threshold _",
    ", @xmath107 where a @xmath108 factor comes from averaging over all impact parameters with @xmath109 .",
    "the lensing rate , amplification and event duration are inter - related . for @xmath110 , the _",
    "median _ value of the distribution of maximal amplifications is simply @xmath111 .",
    "note , however , that the _ mean _ maximal amplification , @xmath112 , diverges logarithmically .",
    "generally , a fraction @xmath113 of the events will have a maximal amplification of @xmath114 or more ( i.e. a peak magnitude above the threshold of @xmath115 or less ) .",
    "the rate of such events is smaller , @xmath116 the time - scale of events amplified by a factor of @xmath117 above the threshold is somewhat longer than the average time - scale ( eq .  [ e : t0 ] ) , since they must cross closer to the line of sight , @xmath118 which approaches @xmath119 for large amplifications .",
    "conversely , for a given @xmath120 and @xmath89 , even a small increase in @xmath121 is associated with a considerable increase in the maximal amplification .",
    "when @xmath79 at @xmath122 , the two images can be resolved . as we show in  [ s : results ] , @xmath77 is already quite small for present - day angular resolutions , and will become smaller still as the resolution improves .",
    "this implies that there may be a non - negligible contribution to the lensing rate from regions beyond @xmath77 .",
    "we therefore have to consider also the case of resolved images .    for @xmath123",
    ", the two images will appear at an offset of @xmath124 from @xmath0 , on opposite sides of it .",
    "the amplifications of the individual images are related by @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which for the high amplifications that are requires in the gc can be approximated as @xmath127 .",
    "the formalism used for calculating the lensing of unresolved images can therefore be applied in this case simply by raising the effective detection threshold by a factor of two ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "this makes resolved images harder to detect , but on the other hand , if both images are observed , the identification of the event as lensing is much more certain .",
    "the formalism for describing unresolved and resolved lensing of stars from below the detection threshold can be also extended to cases where the microlensed source is an observed bright , @xmath129 star . at the current detection threshold ,",
    "the observed central surface density is @xmath130 arcsec@xmath24 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for such a small number of stars , whose orbits can be tracked individually , a statistical treatment is not very useful .",
    "however , our calculations indicate that a ten - fold improvement in the detection threshold will yield an observed central surface density of at least @xmath131 arcsec@xmath24 ( eq .  [ e : dp ] ) .",
    "for such a large sample , a statistical treatment is more meaningful .",
    "we therefore present below , for completeness , results for microlensing amplification of stars fainter than the detection threshold ( ` faint - star lensing ' ) as well as for stars brighter than the detection threshold ( ` bright - star lensing ' ) . for bright - star microlensing",
    "we assume that the effective minimum magnification factor for detection is @xmath92 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "three basic quantities enter into the computation of the microlensing rate : the stellar number density distribution , the stellar velocity field , and the @xmath1-band luminosity function ( klf ) .",
    "the stellar population in the central @xmath132 pc appears to consist of a mixture of old bulge stars , and ` central cluster ' stars which may have been produced in various star - formation episodes during the lifetime of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for recent star formation in the gc has been provided by krabbe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who found a concentration of luminous early - type stars within a few arcsec of @xmath0 , implying a recent ( @xmath133 yr ) starburst in which @xmath134 stars were formed .",
    "additional young stellar systems , the ` arches ' and ` quintuplet ' clusters also exist close the gc and contain large numbers of massive stars ( @xcite )",
    ". a further indication of on - going star - formation in the gc is the fact that the klf in the central cluster extends to more luminous stars than the klf of the galactic bulge as observed via baade s window ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "serabyn & morris ( 1996 ) suggested that continuous star formation in the central cluster is maintained by molecular clouds in the gc , and that the @xmath135 radial light profile of the central cluster reflects the distribution of the star - forming molecular clouds .    in our analysis",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the discrete young clusters in the gc can be modeled by a volume averaged and smoothly distributed stellar population . in particular , we do not consider here lensing events that might be associated with the innermost stellar cusp , which has been identified by eckart & genzel ( 1997 ) and ghez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the immediate vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "an over - density of stars above the smoothed distribution very near the black hole may contribute to very short duration microlensing events .",
    "however , the total stellar mass and luminosity function of the stars that are associated with this ` @xmath0 cusp ' are poorly constrained at the present time , so that computations of the lensing rates require more extensive modeling and analysis .",
    "we will present such computations elsewhere .    because the lensing time - scales increase with distance , long duration events , which are relevant for low sampling rates of the current proper motion studies , tend to be associated with more distant stars .",
    "we therefore consider both stars in the central star - forming cluster , as well as more distant old - population bulge stars in our analysis .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the stellar densities , velocities and klfs of these two components .",

    "kent ( 1992 ) proposed that both the rotation curve and the surface brightness along the major axis of the galactic bulge in the mid - plane of the galaxy at @xmath147kpc can be described as a superposition of bulge and disk components with a mass - to - light ratio , where the solar monochromatic luminosity at @xmath148 m is @xmath149ergs@xmath7@xmath2m@xmath7 . note that genzel et al .",

    "[ f : dqdr ] and [ f : cumr ] .",
    "first , it is evident that the cumulative rate @xmath294 approaches its asymptotic value at @xmath295pc , and that short lensing events due to stars near the black hole dominate the total rate .",

    "the run of the differential rate for long events , @xmath297 , with distance illustrates that the inner regions hardly contribute any long events .",
    "second , unresolved lensing of sub - threshold stars have the shortest timescales .",
    "this is because such events are due mainly to stars close to the black hole where the velocities are high and the lensing cross sections are small .",
    "unresolved lensing of stars which lie above the threshold , for which the cross sections are larger , have somewhat longer timescales , and resolved events , which are due to stars at larger distances from the black hole , are longer still .",
    "third , the rates for resolved lensing are about an order of magnitude smaller than those for unresolved lensing events .",

    "we can now use figs .",
    "[ f : cumr ] and [ f : dk ] and eq .",
    "[ e : p ] to estimate the detection probability and typical amplification of a lensing event in this experiment .",
    "the rate of unresolved and long events which amplify sub - threshold stars is @xmath304yr@xmath7 , with a resulting detection probability @xmath305 .",
    "the median amplifications of such events is @xmath306 above the detection threshold .",
    "the probability for detecting a short amplification of sub - threshold stars is @xmath307 .",
    "the probabilities for detecting unresolved events involving above threshold stars is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the probabilities for detecting long resolved events are an order of magnitude smaller , and the probabilities for detecting short resolved events are negligible in this experiment .",
    "thus , we find that the behavior of the variable source ( or sources ) at @xmath0 , i.e. a brightening of a previously undetected source to @xmath308@xmath15 above the threshold with an event duration of @xmath16 yr , is the typical behavior that would be expected for a microlensing event .",
    "however , we also find that the a - posteriori probability for detecting such an event is only @xmath17 .",
    "the probability for detecting a lensing event can be increased considerably by carrying out more sensitive observations at higher sampling rates .",
    "for example , 10 years of monthly observations with a detection threshold of @xmath309 will require a resolution of @xmath310 , which is already available ( @xcite ) , and will increase the total detection probability of long lensing events to @xmath311 .",
    "these estimates are uncertain by a factor of few due to uncertainties in the stellar density distribution , the @xmath1 luminosity function and the extinction .",
    "in the past several years , very high resolution , very deep ir observations of the gc have regularly monitored stellar motions within few arcsec of the radio source @xmath0 .",
    "the primary objective of these efforts is to dynamically weigh the central dark mass and set lower bounds on its compactness . as a by product",
    ", these observations can detect and record the light curves of faint time - varying sources in the inner gc over timescales of years .",
    "these proper motion studies have recently revealed the possible presence of one or two variable @xmath1-band sources very close to , or coincident with , the position of @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first issue to resolve , when considering results from such technologically challenging observations , is whether these sources are real , or merely artifacts of the complex procedures for obtaining deep diffraction limited images in the crowded gc .",
    "assuming that such a source is indeed real , and that it is not simply a variable star that happens to lie very near to the line of sight to @xmath0 , there are two interesting possibilities to consider , both directly linked to the existence of a super - massive compact object in the gc .",
    "a time variable ir source , coincident with @xmath0 , may be the ir counterpart of the radio source , with the ir flare resulting from fluctuations in the accretion process , which has up to now eluded detection in any band other than the radio ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the new source is a faint star in the dense stellar cluster in the gc , which is microlensed by the black hole .",
    "such amplification events would appear as time varying sources very close to the position of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that a detection of microlensing could provide an independent probe of the compactness of the central dark mass .",
    "the innermost observed stars in the gc set an upper limit on the size of the dark mass , @xmath312 , where @xmath60 is the schwarzschild radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "microlensing has the potential , given a well sampled light curve , to improve on the dynamical limit , since for typical values of the lens  source distance , @xmath313 ( see eq .",
    "[ e : rsch ] ) .",
    "if the central mass is not a black hole , but rather an extended object , then the microlensing light curve will deviate from that of a point - mass lens when @xmath314 . because the innermost observed stars already constrain @xmath315 , only lensed stars in the inner few pc have a small enough @xmath42 to probe possible structure in the dark mass distribution ( eq .  [ e : oe ] ) .",
    "therefore , the question whether there is a significant chance to detect such events is related to the yet unresolved question of whether there is a strongly peaked stellar cusp in the innermost gc . we will discuss these issues elsewhere .    in this paper we investigated the possibility of microlensing amplification of faint stars in the dense stellar cluster in the gc by the super - massive black hole , which is thought to coincide with the radio source @xmath0 .",
    "we calculated in detail the rates , durations and amplifications of such events , and considered separately the cases of unresolved and resolved images and of intrinsically faint and bright sources .",
    "we presented our results in a general way that can be used to estimate the detection probabilities of microlensing for a wide range of observing strategies .    the background stellar surface density increases with the detection threshold @xmath11 .",
    "this determines the observational angular resolution required to detect a microlensing event , and fixes the maximal distance behind the black hole for which the two lensed images of a star will appear unresolved .",
    "this maximal distance occurs before the integrated lensing rate reaches its asymptotic value , even for present - day detection thresholds .",
    "we therefore considered two manifestations of the lensing : unresolved microlensing of stars near the black hole , and resolved lensing of stars farther away .",
    "we find that short lensing events , due to stars close to the black hole , dominate the total lensing rate .",
    "this reflects the fact that the high stellar density and velocities near the black hole more than compensate for the smaller lensing cross - sections there .",
    "for this reason , and because unresolved images are on average twice as bright as the resolved images , unresolved microlensing dominates the lensing rate .",
    "we have also considered the lensing amplification of bright observed stars .",
    "the contribution of this type of microlensing to the total rate becomes progressively more important as the detection threshold decreases , and at low sampling rates , which are primarily sensitive to longer events .",
    "we find that low sampling rates significantly bias the detection towards high amplitude events .",
    "our predicted lensing rates are small , but not so small as to be negligible .",
    "in particular , longer , deeper proper motion monitoring done at higher rates , e.g. 10 years of monthly monitoring with @xmath309 , may have a significant chance of detecting such an event .    finally , could either of the variable sources reported by genzel et al . ( 1997 ) ( source s12 ) and by ghez et al . ( 1998 ) ( source s3 ) be the amplified microlensed image of a faint star ?",
    "the lack of evidence for related variability in the radio and x - rays , as would be expected in some accretion scenarios if the @xmath1-flare were due to fluctuations in the accretion process , argues against the possibility that the new source is the ir counterpart of @xmath0 .",
    "another possibility is that the new sources are variable stars , which are below the detection limit in their low state .",
    "long period variable stars ( lpvs ) , which are probably luminous mira variables , are observed in the gc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "typical amplitude variations of @xmath316@xmath317 are observed over @xmath318@xmath319 yr , although in some cases the variations are as large as @xmath320 .",
    "haller & rieke ( 1989 ) find 12 lpvs in a 4.5 arcmin@xmath321 survey of the gc ( not including the central @xmath322 ) down to @xmath323 ( @xmath324 ) . of these ,",
    "only one exhibited high amplitude variations ( @xmath245 in 4 months ) . at @xmath325 ,",
    "the new variable @xmath1 source is much fainter than the lpvs observed in this survey .",
    "if it is an intrinsically bright lpv , it must be lie on a highly extinguished line of sight . using the observed surface density of @xmath326 , @xmath327 lpvs , it is possible to make a rough estimate of the probability for finding such a star within @xmath328 of @xmath0 . even after taking into account a factor @xmath329 difference in the surface mass density between the dynamical center and the survey area at @xmath330 from the center ,",
    "the probability is only @xmath331 .",
    "this of course does not rule out the possibility of an intrinsically faint but highly variable star . in any case , if the new source is a variable star , future observations should detect continued variability from this source .",
    "we can also argue statistically against the possibility that these flares are due to microlensing of a star by another star in the gc , which happens to be close to the line - of - sight to @xmath0 . because @xmath332 , the typical lensing timescale by a star will be of the order of @xmath318 hr , @xmath333 times shorter than that of lensing by the black hole ( eqs .",
    "[ e : re ] and [ e : rate ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that the total rate of lensing of a star by a star within an angle @xmath21 of the line - of - sight to @xmath0 is @xmath334 yr@xmath7 for @xmath265 , which is 100 time smaller than the rate of lensing by the black hole .",
    "our analysis has shown that the behavior of the variable @xmath1-band source ( or sources ) at @xmath0 , in particular a brightening of a previously undetected source to @xmath335@xmath15 above the threshold , on a timescale of @xmath16 yr , is the typical behavior that would be expected for a microlensing event .",
    "however , we also estimate that the probability that such an event could have been observed during the course of the proper motion studies that have been carried out thus far is only @xmath336 . while this probability is small , it is not so small as to rule out this possibility entirely .",

    "<S> we investigate microlensing amplification of faint stars in the dense stellar cluster in the galactic center by the super - massive black hole , which is thought to coincide with the radio source @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such amplification events would appear very close to the position of @xmath0 , and could be observed , in principle , during the monitoring of stellar proper motions in the galactic center .    </S>",
    "<S> we use observations of the near - infrared @xmath1-band ( 2.2@xmath2 m ) luminosity function in the galactic center and in baade s window , as well as stellar population synthesis computations , to construct empirical and theoretical @xmath1 luminosity function models for the inner 300pc of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> these , together with the observed dynamical properties of the central cluster and inner bulge , are used to compute the rates of microlensing events which amplify stars with different intrinsic luminosities above specified detection thresholds .    </S>",
    "<S> we present computations of the lensing rates as functions of the event durations , which range from several weeks to a few years , for detection thresholds ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that events with durations shorter than a few months dominate the lensing rate because of the very high stellar densities and velocities very near the black hole , where the effective lens size is small . </S>",
    "<S> for the current detection limit of @xmath5 , the total microlensing rate is @xmath6 yr@xmath7 . the rate of events with durations @xmath8 yr is @xmath9 yr@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the median value of the peak amplification for short events is @xmath10 above the detection threshold , and is only weakly dependent on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> long events are rarer , and are associated with more distant stars , stars at the low velocity tail of the velocity distribution , or stars that cross closer to the line - of - sight to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the median peak amplifications of long events are larger and attain values @xmath12 above the threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> recent proper motion studies of stars in the galactic center have revealed the possible presence of one or two variable @xmath1-band sources very close to , or coincident with , the position of @xmath0 ( eckart & genzel 1996 ; genzel et al . 1997 ; ghez et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these sources may have attained peak brightnesses of @xmath13 , about @xmath14@xmath15 above the observational detection limits , and appear to have varied on a timescale of @xmath16 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with long - duration microlensing amplification of faint stars by the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> however , we estimate that the probability that a single such an event could have been detected during the course of the recent proper motion monitoring campaigns is @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> . a ten - fold improvement in the detection limit and @xmath18yr of monthly monitoring could increase the total detection probability to @xmath19 . </S>"
