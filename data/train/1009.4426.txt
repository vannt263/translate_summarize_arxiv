    "quantum computing is an emerging discipline in which information is stored and processed by employing a quantum system . in spite of many proposals for potentially scalable quantum computers @xcite , most physical realizations so far accommodate qubits on the order of ten , at most .",
    "one of the obstacles against scalability in the previous proposals is the absence of controllable interaction between an arbitrary pair of qubits .",
    "nmr realization of a quantum computer employs nuclei in a molecule as qubits , whose inter - qubit coupling is difficult to control @xcite ( see , however , @xcite for a controllable spin - spin coupling and @xcite for a fullerene - based esr quantum computer ) .",
    "many pulses had to be applied to eliminate unwanted interactions in the demonstration of the shor s algorithm with an nmr quantum computer @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to propose a new design of a neutral atom quantum computer with an on - demand interaction , which is potentially scalable up to a large number of qubits within currently available technology .",
    "neutral atoms are believed to be robust against decoherence , another obstacle against a physical realization of a working quantum computer , since they are electrically neutral .",
    "each atom is trapped by a near field fresnel diffraction light , abbreviated as nffd light hereafter , which is produced by letting the trap laser light pass through an aperture with a diameter comparable to the wavelength of the laser .",
    "apertures are arranged in a two - dimensional regular lattice , for example .",
    "nevertheless , the arrangement can be designed freely as will be shown later .",
    "each lattice site is equipped with its own gate control laser beam so that individual single - qubit gate operations can be applied on many qubits individually and simultaneously .",
    "a controlled two - qubit gate operation between an arbitrary pair of qubits is made possible by selectively leaving two atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice and making particular two - qubit states collide by conveying them with a pair of hyperfine state - dependent optical lattice potentials .",
    "the corresponding two - qubit subspace acquires a dynamical phase , which is controllable by adjusting the collision time .",
    "the qubits are sent back to their initial positions after entanglement is established by this state - selective collision @xcite .",
    "technology required for physical implementation of the proposed quantum computer has already been developed in the areas of cold atom trap , near field optical scanning microscope ( snom ) , nanolithography , and quantum optics , among others , and we believe there should be no obstacles against its physical realization .",
    "we outline the design of a neutral atom quantum computer proposed by mandel _",
    "_ in the next section .",
    "we point out problems inherent in their design",
    ". individual atom trap by making use of nffd light is introduced in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to 1- and 2-qubit gate implementations .",
    "we propose alternative designs of a neutral atom quantum computer , which works under the same principle in section v. summary and discussions are given in section vi .",
    "suppose an atom is put in a laser beam with an oscillating electric field @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the laser frequency .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath1 is close to some transition frequency @xmath2 between two states @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the atom .",
    "the interaction between the electric field and the dipole moment of the atom introduces an interaction hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dipole moment operator of the atom .",
    "this interaction introduces an effective potential of the form @xmath7 for an atom in the ground state , which is called the ac stark shift . here",
    "@xmath8 , while @xmath9 is the detuning .",
    "we have ignored the small natural line width of the excited state . in case @xmath10 ( blue - detuned laser )",
    ", @xmath11 is positive and a region with large @xmath11 works as a repulsive potential .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath12 ( red - detuned laser ) , @xmath11 is negative and a region with large @xmath13 works as an attractive potential .",
    "we use these facts extensively in the following proposals .",
    "it is possible to confine neutral atoms by introducing a set of counter propagating laser beams with the same frequency and amplitude along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "these beams produce a standing wave potential of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wave number of the laser .",
    "it is possible to confine atoms three - dimensionally by adding two sets of counterpropagating beams along the @xmath17- and the @xmath18-axes , which results in @xmath19 where we put the wave numbers of the six lasers are identical for simplicity .",
    "note that the lattice constant is always @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the wavelength of the laser .",
    "mandel _ et al .",
    "_ trapped atoms in such an optical potential.@xcite they used the rabi oscillation to implement one - qubit gates , in which a microwave ( mw ) field is applied . naturally , all the atoms are under mw irradiation and selective one - qubit gate operation is impossible .",
    "they have chosen qubit basis vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be in harmony with the one - qubit gate operation making use of the rabi oscillation .    for two - qubit gate operations , they introduced time - dependent polarization in the counterpropagating laser beams as @xmath24 these counterpropagating laser beams produce an optical potential of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denotes counterclockwise ( clockwise ) circular polarization .",
    "note that the first component ( @xmath28 ) moves along the @xmath14-axis as @xmath29 is increased , while the second component ( @xmath30 ) moves along the @xmath31-axis under this change . @xcite    the component @xmath26 introduces transitions between fine structures ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the transitions from @xmath35 to @xmath36 are red - detuned , while the transition from @xmath35 to @xmath37 is blue - detuned if @xmath1 is chosen between the transition frequencies of @xmath38 and @xmath32 . then by adjusting @xmath1 properly ,",
    "it is possible to cancel the attractive potential and the repulsive potential associated with these transitions .",
    "the net contribution of the @xmath26 laser beam in this case is an attractive potential for an atom in the state @xmath39 .",
    "we denote this potential as @xmath40 in the following .",
    "similarly , the @xmath27 component introduces a net attractive potential @xmath41 , through the transition @xmath42 on an atom in the state @xmath43 .",
    "mandel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite took advantage of these state dependent potentials to implement a two - qubit gate .",
    "the potentials acting on @xmath44 and @xmath45 are evaluated as @xmath46 by applying the walsh - hadamard gate on @xmath47 , one generates a tensor product state @xmath48 then by decreasing the phase @xmath29 , the state @xmath49 moves with dominating @xmath50 toward @xmath51-direction , while @xmath45 moves with @xmath52 toward @xmath31-direction .",
    "thus it is possible to make @xmath53 and @xmath54 collide between the two lattice points .",
    "if they are kept in the common potential well during @xmath55 , the subspace @xmath56 obtains a dynamical phase @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the on - site repulsive potential in the potential well .",
    "after these two components spent @xmath55 in the potential well , they are brought back to the initial lattice point by reversing @xmath29 , which results in the two - qubit gate operation @xmath59 near field fresnel diffraction trap -----------------------------------    we show in the present section that atoms are trapped in an array of nffd traps , each of which traps a single atom .",
    "an nffd light is produced if a plane wave is incident to a screen with an aperture of the radius @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio @xmath61 is called the fresnel number .",
    "let us concentrate on a single neutral atom qubit . to make our analysis concrete , we take an alkali metal atom @xmath62rb as an example .",
    "we take qubit basis vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 , to be consistent with single - qubit operations , which involve well - established two - photon raman transitions @xcite .",
    "bandi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to trap an atom with a microtrap employing nffd light .",
    "the trap potential is evaluated by applying the rayleigh - sommerfeld formula as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the amplitude of the incoming plane wave , @xmath16 , its wave number , the detuning @xmath69 is negative ( red - detuned ) , and the plane wave is incident to a screen from the @xmath70-axis .",
    "the integral is over the aperture region @xmath71 .",
    "figure 1 shows the nffd trap potential , which is obtained by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : rs ] ) numerically .",
    "it is found that the distance between the local minimum of the potential and the aperture changes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 as the aperture radius changes from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "thus the position of the local potential minimum may be controllable by controlling the aperture radius , which may be possible within current technology .    , ( b ) @xmath76 , and ( c ) @xmath75 , where @xmath77 is the aperture radius and @xmath21 the wavelength of the incoming laser beam .",
    "the right panel is the contour plot while the left panel shows the potential profile along the @xmath18-axis.,width=302 ]        [ fig : concept ]    figure 2 shows an array of optical traps , arranged in a regular 2-d lattice .",
    "it is clear by construction that we have freedom in the choice of the lattice constant and the lattice shape .",
    "we may even arrange the traps in an irregular form if necessary .",
    "this is a remarkable new feature , which a conventional optical lattice can not provide with .",
    "an optical lattice is always regular , whose lattice constant is on the order of the wavelength of the laser beams .    attached to each atom is an optical fiber , though which two laser beams are fed , one is for atom trapping while the other is to control the hyperfine qubit states of the atom",
    ". it is required to turn on and off the trap laser individually , which is required to implement a selective two - qubit gate as will be shown later .",
    "the gate control laser is also controllable so that one - qubit gates may be applied on many qubits simultaneously and independently .",
    "for a quantum system to be a candidate of a general purpose quantum computer , it is necessary for the system to be able to implement a universal set of quantum gates , that is , the set of one qubit gates and almost any two - qubit gate @xcite .",
    "now we explain how these gates are realized in our proposal .",
    "let us assume , for definiteness , the trap potential is strong enough so that inter - atomic interaction is switched off .",
    "along with the nffd trap light , there is a gate control laser beam propagating through the fiber , which is depicted in a green broken line in fig .  2 .",
    "one - qubit gate is implemented by making use of the two - photon raman transition @xcite .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath78 be the energy eigenvalues of the states @xmath49 and @xmath79 , respectively , and let @xmath80 be the energy eigenvalue of an auxiliary excited state @xmath81 necessary for the raman transition .",
    "suppose a laser beam with the frequency @xmath1 has been applied to the atom .",
    "let @xmath82 be the detuning and @xmath83 be the rabi oscillation frequency between the state @xmath84 and @xmath4 .",
    "then , under the assumptions @xmath85 , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath86 where @xmath87 note that @xmath88 generates all the elements of su(2 ) since there are two @xmath89 generators @xmath90 in the hamiltonian and their coefficients are controllable .",
    "one - qubit gate implementations with the two - photon raman transitions have been already demonstrated @xcite .",
    "although a two - qubit gate operation has been already experimentally demonstrated @xcite , a selective gate operation is yet to be realized .",
    "we propose to use a one - dimensional optical lattice or a set of optical lattices to selectively apply a two - qubit gate in the aforementioned setting .",
    "a one - dimensional optical lattice is made of a pair of counterpropagating laser beams with the same linear polarization , in which the basis states @xmath91 and @xmath92 are subject to the same trap potential .",
    "alternatively , hyperfine - state - senstive trap potentials may be introduced if two counterpropagating laser beams with tilted polarizations , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , are superposed .",
    "this results in @xmath95 where @xmath96 denote two circular polarizations .",
    "the electric field results in the stark shifts @xmath97 and detailed analysis of optical transitions shows that the effective potentials acting on @xmath49 and @xmath45 are @xmath98 respectively , where use has been made of the following decompositions @xmath99 it is important to note that @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) moves right ( left ) if @xmath29 is increased , which implies that the components @xmath49 and @xmath45 move in opposite directions as @xmath29 is changed .",
    "suppose a one - dimensional optical lattice , with the potential depth considerably shallower than that of the individual trap potential , is always superposed with the trap potentials .",
    "it is assumed that the lattice constant of the trap potential array is an integral multiple of the optical lattice period and the bottom of the trap potential sits in one of the bottoms of the optical lattice .",
    "the atom is in the motional ground state of the combined potential in an idle time .",
    "two qubit - gate operation is implemented with six steps . to simplify our exposition",
    ", we assume the trap array is a square lattice and two atoms , on which the gate acts , are aligned along one of the primitive lattice vectors .",
    "more general cases will be treated later .",

    "( a ) steps 1 and 2 . the left and the right atoms",
    "are acted by the walsh - hadamard gate in advance so that each of them is in the superposition of @xmath49 ( white semicircle ) and @xmath45 ( black semicircle ) .",
    "there nffd trap potentials are turned off adiabatically .",
    "the red contours depict the optical lattice potential along the @xmath14-axis while the black coutours show the individual nffd potential .",

    "( b ) step 3 .",
    "the screen supporting the nffd traps is moved away from the optical lattice after traps of the two atoms are turned off .",

    "( c ) step 4 .",
    "two atoms in the superposition of @xmath49 and @xmath45 are left in the optical lattice .",
    "now the polarizations of the counterpropagating laser beams are tilted by @xmath102 so that the @xmath49 and @xmath45 components move in the opposite directions , which results in the collision of @xmath49 of one atom and @xmath45 of the other . if these components are kept together for a duration @xmath55 , the component obtains a dynamical phase @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the interaction strength of the two components .",
    "( d ) steps 5 and 6 . the screen is put back to the initial position and the nffd traps of the two atoms are turned on subsequently.,width=283 ]    1 .",
    "the hadamard gate acts on each of the two qubits taking part in the gate operation by manipulating the control laser beams , which results in the superpostion of @xmath103 , 2 .",
    "the trap potentials of the two qubits are turned off adiabatically so that the resulting motional states remain in the local ground states in the optical lattice .",
    "then the trap potential array is shifted away from the optical lattice .",
    "the motional state of a qubit , which does not take part in the gate operation , ends up with the ground state of the shifted trap potential provided that the shift is adiabatically done .",
    "now only the two qubits to be operated by the gate remain in the optical lattice .",
    "polarizations @xmath29 of the counterpropagating laser beams are controlled so that @xmath49 of one qubit collides with @xmath45 of the other qubit",
    ". then the vector @xmath104 obtains an extra dynamical phase factor @xmath105 , where @xmath58 is the energy shift due to the collision while @xmath55 is the time during which the two states are in contact @xcite .",
    "the components @xmath104 are put back to their initial positions in the optical lattice by reversing the change in @xmath29 .",
    "6 .   then the screen is put back to its initial position so that the trap potentials overlap again with the optical lattice .",
    "subsequently , the trap potentials of the two qubits , which were temporarily switched off , are turned on again .",
    "one - qubit gates may be applied on the two qubits if necessary .    in case the two atoms are in a general position , not necessarily along a primitive lattice vector",
    ", we may introduce two orthogonal optical lattices as shown in fig .",
    "4 . then the selected atomic states @xmath49 of one atom and @xmath45 of the other meet at the intersection of the two optical lattices to acquire the extra dynamical phase .",
    "it should be noted that two - qubit gate operations may be applied simultaneously and independently on many pairs of qubits .    , width=264 ]    figure  4  ( b ) employs a radial array of nffd traps .",
    "the radial center is the position where interaction of qubit states takes place . in the radial construction ,",
    "however , simultaneous application of two - qubit gates on many pairs of qubits is difficult .",
    "there are several variations of the current proposal . instead of leaving two atoms in the optical lattice and withdraw the rest of the atoms , we may initialize the register so that no atoms are present in the optical lattice .",
    "then a pair of atoms are sent to the optical lattice by enlarging the size of the aperture as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] , in which we indicate a double - layer construction .",
    "we may double the number of qubits and , at the same time , reduce the execution time with this implementation .",
