    "star formation is a very active area of research both observationally and theoretically , with many unanswered questions .",
    "one such area is binary and multiple systems .",
    "they are very common and their formation involves both disk fragmentation and accretion .",
    "binaries are particularly important for a number of reasons .",
    "they result in redistribution of angular momentum during formation and have an important effect on the distribution of masses , the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "furthermore , stars on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) are at their minimum radius , and hence as they evolve and expand , some binary stars will diverge in their evolution from single stars if they become large enough to undergo roche lobe overflow . for the most massive stars ( o stars )",
    "it has recently been estimated that more than 70% will exchange mass through this process ( sana et al . 2012 ) , and a third of those will merge .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the predictions for post - main sequence evolution .",
    "it is important to determine what fraction of less massive b stars meets this fate .",
    "furthermore , high mass stars are destined to become compact objects . some of those in binary systems will ultimately provide a zoo of exotic end - stage objects : symbiotic stars , novae , cataclysmic variable stars , supernovae .",
    "for all these reasons , we need to determine the properties of the population of binaries in order to link these stages together .",
    "( in this paper we will use `` binaries '' as short hand for binaries or higher order multiple systems . indeed , in many contexts the tightest subsystem in a multiple functions as a binary . )    in order to untangle and understand all these processes , binary properties are needed as a function of stellar mass , binary mass ratio , and separation . because star formation covers many decades of separation ( with very different properties of the `` raw material '' ) from the beginning of the collapse to the zams ,",
    "it is probable that binary properties also differ depending on , for instance , the separation .",
    "we begin by summarizing what is known about binary properties of stars with different masses .    * solar mass stars : * binary properties of low mass stars are reasonably well known , notably through the seminal study of duquennoy and mayor ( 1991 ) . the combination of coravel velocities ( below ) with visual binary results and common proper motion pairs produced a distribution of binary periods which has become the cornerstone of the discussion of binary systems .",
    "the recent study of raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) expanded the results considerably , and tokovinin ( 2014 ) added further discussion of hierarchical multiples .    *",
    "o stars : * properties of massive and intermediate mass stars ( o and b ) stars are less well determined .",
    "they are rarer , and hence typically more distant .",
    "their spectral lines are broad , and hence velocities can not be as precisely determined as for cooler stars .",
    "finally , particularly for the most massive stars ( o stars ) the interpretation is complicated by high rotation and continuous mass loss .",
    "o star binary properties have been discussed by sana et al .",

    "* b stars : * b stars provide a valuable step in tracing the progression of binary properties from low mass to high mass , and largely avoid the complications of mass loss in interpretation .",
    "radial velocity studies of b stars date back many years .",
    "wolff ( 1978 ) found that approximately 24% of late b stars are binaries with periods @xmath6 100 days and mass ratios m@xmath7/m@xmath8 @xmath9 0.1 .",
    "abt , and coworkers ( e.g. abt , gomez , and levy [ 1987 ] ) combined radial velocities with visual binaries and common proper motion stars for b stars and discussed the implications on star formation .",
    "similar work was done by levato et al .",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "binary studies of b stars have been enhanced greatly by interferometry and high resolution imaging techniques .",
    "for instance , using speckle interferometry , mason et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that 64% of the b stars in their ob star sample had companions with @xmath10 v @xmath6 3 mag between 0.03  and 5  separation .",
    "however , many stars were included on the target list because they already showed some indication of being binary ( mason 2014 , private communication ) , so the sample is not unbiased .",
    "intermediate mass stars binaries in sco ob2 were studied by kouwenhoven et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who found a binary fraction of @xmath970% .",
    "shatsky and tokovinin ( 2002 ) made an adaptive optics survey of the b stars in sco ob2 , identifying essentially all companions with separations between 45 and 900 au .",
    "they found a companion star fraction of 0.20 @xmath11 0.04 per decade of separation .    *",
    "a stars : * binary properties of a stars ( only slightly less massive than b stars ) are discussed by de rosa et al .",
    "they find a different distribution of mass ratios for separations smaller and larger than 125 au ( a period of 570 years ) .",
    "they find 44% of their volume limited sample is binary or multiple .",
    "stellar multiplicity over all masses and separations was recently summarized by duchene and krauss ( 2013 ) , who find an increasing multiplicity fraction with increasing mass .",
    "* cepheids * : studies to identify and characterize binary cepheids have been numerous , particularly in the effort to measure masses to provide information to resolve `` the cepheid mass problem '' .",
    "cepheids , which began on the main sequence as b stars , provide several ways to improve our knowledge of binary properties of intermediate mass stars .",
    "it is the aim of the present study to use cepheid velocities to contribute to our understanding of binary properties of intermediate and massive stars .",
    "a variety of techniques have been used to determine the distributions of periods and mass ratios of cepheids .",
    "two recent summaries are provided by szabados and by evans et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "we have undertaken three related studies to determine the properties of intermediate mass stars , in particular cepheids , and their progenitor b stars .",
    "this is both to determine whether the consequences of binarity are as severe as for o stars , and also because some binary properties can be particularly well determined making use of the characteristics of these stars . in this study",
    "we focus on a property of cepheids which sets them apart from their main sequence counterparts , namely their sharp spectral lines and accurate velocities .",
    "this classic approach to binary studies lets us probe both systems with periods longer than a few days and also systems with low mass secondaries . in the second approach ,",
    "we use x - ray studies of late b stars to determine the fraction which have low mass companions ( evans et al .",
    "late b stars themselves do not in general produce x - rays , but companions later than mid - f spectral type are copious x - ray producers at the young age of the system . thus low mass companions can be identified through x - ray observations of late b stars in a cluster .",
    "third , we have made a survey with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) to determine the properties of resolved companions of cepheids ( evans , et al .",
    "this study demonstrates another contribution cepheids can make to the understanding of binaries .",
    "since many companions dominate in the satellite ultraviolet , the mass of the secondary , and hence the mass ratio , can be determined from an uncontaminated spectrum .",
    "ultimately , this combination of techniques will enable us to provide a much improved description of the binary properties of these intermediate mass stars .",
    "there is one feature of cepheids , however , which makes their binary properties more difficult to interpret ( or possibly will help us get a handle on another aspect of binarity ) . since cepheids are post red - giant branch stars , short period binary systems have undergone interactions , presumably resulting in mergers in a number of cases .",
    "indeed , the shortest period system in the milky way containing a cepheid has an orbital period of a year ( sugars and evans 1996 ) .",
    "an additional complication to the interpretation is that multiple systems may undergo dynamical evolution until they reach a stable hierarchical state .",
    "a component ( typically the smallest ) may be ejected from the system in the process .",
    "the advent of correlation spectrometers vastly increased the quantity of accurate radial velocities available for cepheids .",
    "the coravel instrument at the geneva observatory ( baranne et al .",
    "1979 ) observed a large number of cepheids for studies of galactic structure and to obtain cepheid distances via a variant of the baade wesselink technique .",
    "the accuracy of the velocities is typically less than 1  km  s@xmath1 in the magnitude range of the stars in this study .",
    "a similar instrument was built at moscow university ( tokovinin 1987 ) . between these instruments",
    "( including an extension to the southern hemisphere ) , a large number of cepheids has been observed since 1978 .",
    "a major purpose of these observations was to discover binaries which can then be used to measure cepheid masses .",
    "while radial velocity spectrometers have produced a huge amount of velocity data for cepheids , the data have never been analyzed to determine the fraction of stars which show no orbital motion over the more than three decades they cover .",
    "that is the goal of this project , crav ( * c*epheid * ra*dial * v*elocities ) .",
    "many cepheids have been identified as binary systems .",
    "however , the binary frequency is only obtained if we know how many single stars are also included in the sample .",
    "the main aim of this project is to examine the sample of stars for orbital motion , or in its absence , to produce a well characterized sample of stars without orbital motion .",
    "we have deliberately limited the data examined to observations with a typical accuracy of 1 km s@xmath1 per observation and studies which included many cepheids to allow cross - checks on the accuracy . in this first paper , we include data from 1978 to 2000 of `` northern stars '' down to -20.9@xmath12 ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we plan two subsequent papers on southern stars and observations since 2000 . as discussed in the detection limits section , with this sample",
    ", we will detect almost all binaries with orbital periods of 1 to 20 years down to mass ratios q = m@xmath7/ m@xmath8 = 0.1 ( where m@xmath8 is @xmath13 m@xmath7 ) , that is companions as cool as k stars .",
    "we begin with the 38 stars in table 2 which meet these criteria , omitting stars known to be binary . to complete the analysis",
    ", we examine all stars brighter than 9@xmath14 magnitude ( table 6 , 62 stars ) , ultimately omitting stars deemed to have too little information .",
    "the purpose of crav is to investigate the annual mean systemic velocities of cepheids with accurate velocities .",
    "the observed cepheid velocity , of course , is a combination of the systemic velocity of the star and the pulsation velocity curve . to correct for the pulsation velocity , we use a fourier representation of the curve with up to 20 terms .",
    "the velocity curves have to be aligned over decades by means of a pulsation period .",
    "both these steps will be discussed in sections below .",
    "finally , cross - checking the results of the annual means between studies identifies and removes small systematic differences .",
    "the accuracy with which a cepheid velocity can be measured ( 1 km s@xmath1 ) is easily the highest for high and intermediate mass stars .",
    "while this accuracy in the annual means does not come close to the highest accuracy possible today ( e.g. anderson 2014 ) , the long sequence of data at this level is valuable .",
    "the details of the sample which is available at this level of accuracy are discussed in this section .",
    "the moscow velocities ( gorynya et al . 1992 , 1996 , 1998 , referred to as gorynya et al .",
    "below ) are a large dataset for which many stars are covered annually in the 1990 s .",
    "for this reason , we are defining our `` northern sample '' to be stars with dec @xmath9 -20@xmath15.9 , the region they covered .",
    "for the most southern stars in the sample , data from a few studies have been deferred to the next paper ( southern stars ) so that we can assess the zeropoints of the whole study .",

    "some stars in these groups have period fluctuations on longer timescales than the 20 years discussed here , so a single period was adequate to phase the data . since it is desirable to have binary information on both high mass ( long period stars ) and overtone pulsators , in some cases we have adopted a more complicated approach",

    "however , there may be some systems in the list of single stars ( table  [ mult.stat ] ) which began life as a short period binary , but have now merged , thus moving from the binary list to the single list .",
    "the obvious and simplest result of this is to increase the number of currently single stars and decrease the binary fraction .",
    "we have stressed that cepheids provide a well characterized sample to investigate the properties of spectroscopic binaries , specifically , in the period range of one to 20 years .",
    "in addition to providing the binary frequency , this group has another valuable property .",
    "because the primary ( cepheid ) has evolved to become a cool supergiant , hot companions can be observed directly in the ultraviolet .",

    "a few stars require extra comments .",
    "mu cep , mw cyg , vz cyg , and fn vel were not observed by iue because they are fainter than the survey limit , so they lack mass ratio information , and are listed at the bottom of table 8 .",
    "the mass ratio data concentrates on orbital periods of 30 years or less because that includes the most of the known orbits , and also corresponds reasonably well to the period range which the present radial velocity data are sensitive to .",
    "however , aw per with a slightly longer orbital period is included .",
    "we also made an exception and included w sgr , even though the mass of the hottest companion ( col 2 ) is actually of a resolved companion , not the companion of the spectroscopic orbit ( evans et al .",
    "this means the mass ratio is actually an upper limit to the ratio of the spectroscopic system .",
    "figure 7 shows the distribution of the mass ratios for the cepheid systems .",
    "the q data from table 8 were divided into bins of 0.2 for q @xmath9 0.4 . for smaller q values ( both observed values and upper limits ) ,",

    "the location of the data for the lowest q value is shifted slightly for clarity .",
    "poisson errors are shown .",
    "although the sample is fairly small , it is clear that there is no preference for equal mass companions in the cepheid sample .",
    "we stress that this sample contains systems with periods longer than a year , so this says nothing about studies of shorter period systems which have been found in some studies to show a preference for equal mass companions . creating a single bin for stars with",
    "q @xmath6 0.4 may disguise a rise in frequency for small q values . if even half of the 6 stars which have only an upper limit belong to the 0.2 to 0.4 bin , the number in that bin rises to 7 , larger than the 0.4 to 0.6 bin .",
    "even with a simpler division into two bins , 00.5 and 0.5  1.0 because of small number statistics , the result still favors small q systems .",
    "the two bins have 14 and 6 systems , respectively .",
    "in addition , from the detection analysis ( fig .",
    "4 ) , any undiscovered binaries are likely to be in the 0.0 to 0.2 bin .",
    "nevertheless , the mass ratio distribution is relatively flat , and similar to that found by sana and evans ( 2011 ) for more massive o stars over the whole range of periods they studied .",
    "as we get more and more information about binary / multiple systems , we can investigate the finer detail of the properties .",
    "we have used the data of raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to create a comparison with solar mass stars .",
    "specifically , we have used their figure 17 ( the spectroscopic binaries shown as + ) to create a distribution of mass ratios for the period range 1 year to 30 years .",

    "7 between 5@xmath38 cepheids and solar mass stars , it may be that the apparent differences are the result of asking the wrong question .",
    "for instance , the companions are also drawn from very different populations ( typically 3 @xmath38 vs 0.5 @xmath38 ) . from the fig .",
    "17 in raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) it is clear that the distribution of q changes from short period systems ( large q ) to longer period ones ( spread in q to smaller values ) . in this sense",
    ", the distribution of q for solar mass stars would be more similar for the group of longer period stars .",
    "a brief comparison with the previous distribution of mass ratios for cepheids ( evans 1995 ) is in order .",
    "the current distribution of q is flatter for two reasons .",
    "first , accumulating evidence favors somewhat smaller cepheid masses .",
    "second , a realization of the large number of triple systems makes the derivation of lower limits more questionable .",
    "one further point should be mentioned in discussing the binary fraction of cepheids .",
    "in addition to the alteration in the binary systems when a post - main sequence short period binary undergoes roche lobe overflow , there may be mass loss during the cepheid phase itself .",
    "see , for example the summary in neilson et al .",
    "while mass loss at this phase is not as dramatic as in massive main sequence stars , it could affect both the mass ratios and the orbits .",
    "in addition , comparison with main sequence progenitors will be altered .",
    "resolution of these questions awaits further information on mass - loss at the cepheid phase .",
    "we have examined velocity data for cepheids to determine the binary / multiple fraction .",
    "the velocity data have a typical accuracy of 1 km  s@xmath1 per observation , and were obtained over a period of 20 years . after correcting the observed velocities for the pulsation velocity , annual means",
    "were formed .",
    "we have assessed our detection limits and found a high probability of recognizing binary systems with mass ratios as small as 0.1 and periods as long as 20 years .",
    "further data extending the time series will increase the the period / separation range .",
    "a binary fraction was formed by combining this sample with cepheids known to be members of binary / multiple systems .",
    "the binary fraction appears to decease at fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , we take this to be an indication of undiscovered binaries at fainter magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the most reliable binary fraction of 29 @xmath11 8% ( 20 @xmath11 6% per decade of orbital period ) comes from the sample of the 40 brightest stars , which has the most complete information . the range of separations that the cepheids sample probes is approximately 2 to 20 au , which is poorly studied for other massive stars . comparing",
    "the binary fraction in this limited period / separation range with the other recent determinations of binary frequency confirms that the high accuracy velocities of the cepheids results in a higher binary frequency .",
    "the distribution of the mass ratio q is also examined from spectral information about the companions in the ultraviolet , and found to be flat as a function of q.    future work is planned to extend the time span in the northern hemisphere , and also to make a similar analysis of cepheids in the southern hemisphere .",

    "<S> comparison of this fraction in this period range ( 1 - 20 years ) implies a large fraction for the full period range . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable in that the high accuracy velocities are sensitive to the longer periods and smaller orbital velocity amplitudes in the period range sampled here . </S>",
    "<S> thus the cepheid velocity sample provides a sensitive detection in the period range between short period spectroscopic binaries and resolved companions . </S>",
