    "a recent experiment of hill _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that measured electrical and thermal conductivities of the optimally doped copper oxide superconductor pr@xmath7ce@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( pcco ) in its normal state found striking deviations from the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law .",
    "the electron - doped pcco compound with @xmath10 near the optimal @xmath11 doping is the analog of the hole doped material la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath12 ( lsco ) , which is also optimally doped at approximately @xmath13 with a maximum @xmath14 .",
    "lower @xmath15 in pcco makes it particularly convenient from a technical point of view since an external magnetic field is necessary to destroy superconductivity to study its low temperature transport properties in the normal state .",
    "while for lsco the upper critical field is @xmath16 , in the optimally doped pcco the superconductivity is already destroyed at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the choice of overdoped compounds that can be driven into the normal state by a relatively small magnetic field @xmath18 is wider and the hole overdoped system tl@xmath19ba@xmath19cuo@xmath20 ( tl-2201 ) with @xmath21 was studied very recently by proust _ et al .",
    "they verified that in the overdoped tl-2201 wf law holds perfectly .",
    "the wf law is one of the basic properties of a fermi liquid , reflecting the fact that the ability of a quasiparticle to transport heat is the same as its ability to transport charge , provided it can not lose energy through collisions .",
    "the wf law states that the ratio of the heat conductivity @xmath22 to the electrical conductivity @xmath23 of a metal is a universal constant : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is electron charge , and @xmath27 is sommerfeld s value for the lorenz ratio @xmath28 . to be more precise , one should also specify the temperature range where the wf law holds . strictly speaking this law",
    "is proven only in the limit @xmath2 and for a small concentration of impurities @xcite . in a less strict sense",
    "it is often implied that the wf law is valid for @xmath29 , where @xmath3 is chemical potential . in this case",
    "one can provide some qualitative arguments @xcite that if the scattering from impurities does not strongly depend on the energy the wf will still be valid .",
    "moreover , for @xmath29 and elastic electron scattering these arguments can also be extended to the case of a strong ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) quantizing magnetic field @xcite , where @xmath32 is the distance between landau levels and @xmath33 is the impurity scattering rate .",
    "thus , if these conditions are fulfilled , any violation of the wf law would indicate that there is a breakdown of the picture based on the fermi liquid theory .",
    "one of the possible theoretical interpretations of the wf law breakdown is that the quasiparticle fractionalizes into separate spin and charge .",
    "this separation can be investigated using various models and approaches , so here we mention only the most recent studies done in the context of the wf law violation in cuprates . specifically , the wf law violation has been studied for a large-@xmath34 limit of the @xmath35 model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "another examination of the wf law was done by yang and nayak ( yn ) @xcite and also by kim and carbotte ( kc ) @xcite within the phenomenological @xmath0-density - wave ( ddw ) picture .    the ddw scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the assumption that the pseudogap phenomenon @xcite in high-@xmath15 cuprates is the result of the development of another order parameter called the ddw order @xcite that has @xmath0-wave symmetry : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spin index , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the lattice constant . in comparison to the @xmath0-wave superconducting order the ddw order parameter appears to be rather exotic because it breaks the time reversal , translation by one lattice spacing and rotation by @xmath41 symmetries , but respects any combination of two of these .",
    "the underlying reason for this breaking is that there are countercirculating currents in the ddw ground state .",
    "the schematic phase diagram for the ddw pseudogap scenario is shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] . for a hole doping larger than the critical value @xmath42 @xcite ,",
    "the ddw order is presumed to disappear , whereas for the underdoped system ddw order coexists with @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( @xmath0sc ) .",
    "one of the unusual features of the ddw state is that for a half - filled system the chemical potential of the nodal quasiparticles participating in the electrical and thermal transport can be small or even zero , i.e. , @xmath43 , which violates the usual conditions of the wf law validity .",
    "indeed , exactly in the limit @xmath44 the wf law is strongly violated in the extremely clean limit @xcite .",
    "there is no wf law violation in the @xmath45 limit for finite @xmath3 and/or @xmath33 @xcite . for finite temperatures the wf violation depends on the impurity scattering @xcite : in the born limit ( for a constant impurity scattering rate ) there is no change in the wf law , but in the unitary limit for the frequency dependent scattering rate the wf law is violated , but only for @xmath46 smaller that the ddw gap . when @xmath3 is increased sufficiently , the lorenz number becomes approximately equal to its conventional value and its temperature dependence is small .    while in general the validity of the ddw pseudogap scenario is still questionable , it is important to scrutinize all its theoretical consequences .",
    "one of the opportunities is to study possible wf law violations using the ddw model , so that these results can be compared with the experimental results of refs .",
    "although this investigation to a large extent had already been done by yn @xcite and kc @xcite , both these papers do not consider _ the presence of the external magnetic field _ which is an essential ingredient of the experiments @xcite . indeed , in these experiments the ddw state appears in the magnetic field in the underdoped regime at low @xmath5 when the superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "in this paper we study the wf law for the ddw model _ including _ the external magnetic field for a constant impurity scattering rate , paying special attention to the regime @xmath47 where the violation of the wf law is expected . although there are some formal similarities between the ddw and @xmath0-wave superconducting states , the present problem is much simpler because there are no vortices and no superflows surrounding them in the ddw state .",
    "the @xmath48 symmetry in the ddw state also remains unbroken , so that the electromagnetic field enters into the effective low - energy theory in the same way as in qed@xmath49 .",
    "thus we avoid the famous problem of _ dirac landau - level mixing _ ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we begin by presenting in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] the model ddw hamiltonian and rewriting it using two - component spinors .",
    "since there is a discrepancy between the expressions for the electrical current used by yn @xcite and kc @xcite , we also derive the electrical current operator and show that in the nodal approximation it reduces to the current of ref .",

    "[ fig:15 ] that such a behavior of @xmath382 is due to the _ presence _ of the magnetic field .",
    "this confirms our claim that to interpret theoretically the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite one should take into account the influence of the external field .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) we have obtained analytical expressions for electrical conductivity ( [ sigma.final2 ] ) and thermal conductivity ( [ thermal.conductivity.general.final3 ] ) in the ddw state in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "\\(2 ) we have established a correspondence between the expression for the electrical conductivity ( [ sigma.like.langer ] ) in the ddw state written in terms of the generalized velocity @xmath196 , eq .",
    "( [ velocity.general ] ) , and the dc conductivity derived by langer @xcite in the bubble approximation with the vertex ( [ lambda.langer ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) we have shown that in the ddw system in the presence of impurities the wf law holds in @xmath2 limit for an arbitrary field @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "this is checked within the bubble approximation , i.e. , not including the impurity vertex .",
    "the influence of the impurity vertex on the properties of the ddw state in zero field at half - filling can be considered using the heuristical arguments of durst and lee @xcite for @xmath0sc state . since in the @xmath0sc state the thermal ( and spin ) currents are proportional to the group velocity , they can relax through either intranode scattering or scattering between nodes . as a result",
    ", the different types of scattering play nearly the same role and therefore vertex corrections do not contribute to the thermal ( and spin ) conductivity .",
    "this is not the case of the electrical current in the @xmath0sc state , because it depends only on the fermi velocity .",
    "thus , the electrical current can relax more effectively via scattering from node to node than it can via scattering within a single node .",
    "this difference is taken into account by considering vertex corrections which modify the bare bubble expression for the electrical conductivity .",
    "since the electrical current in the ddw state is also proportional to the group velocity , the corresponding impurity vertex should not contribute to the electrical conductivity .",
    "moreover , the thermal current in the ddw state is also proportional to the group velocity , so that one can rely on the same arguments about the impurity vertex as for the @xmath0sc case .",
    "thus we do not expect that in the ddw state the impurity vertex can be a source of the wf violation at @xmath2 .",
    "these observations should be confirmed by detailed calculations of the impurity vertex corrections , which , however , are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "\\(4 ) for finite temperatures @xmath4 , the wf law violation is possible and in zero field the thermal conductivity dominates over the electrical conductivity , i.e. , @xmath389 .",
    "\\(5 ) for @xmath4 in the nonzero field the wf law violation becomes even stronger than in zero field and depending on the temperature both regimes @xmath390 and @xmath389 are possible .",
    "\\(6 ) for @xmath391 there is no wf violation even in the presence of magnetic field .",
