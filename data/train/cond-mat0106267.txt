    "the prediction of the yield stress for electrorheological ( er ) fluids is the main concern in theoretical investigations of er fluids .",
    "early studies failed to derive the experimental yield stress data @xcite because these studies were almost based on a point - dipole approximation @xcite .",
    "the point - dipole approximation is routinely adopted in computer simulation because it is simple and easy to use . since many - body and multipolar interactions between particles have been neglected , the strength of er effects predicted by this model is of an order lower than the experimental results .",
    "hence , substantial effort has been made to sort out more accurate models .",
    "klingenberg and coworkers developed empirical force expression from numerical solution of laplace s equation @xcite .",
    "davis used the finite - element method @xcite .",
    "clercx and bossis developed a full multipolar treatment to account for multipolar polarizability of spheres up to 1,000 multipolar orders @xcite .",
    "yu and coworkers developed an integral equation method which avoids the match of complicated boundary conditions on each interface of the particles and is applicable to nonspherical particles and multimedia @xcite .",
    "although the above methods are accurate , they are relatively complicated to use in dynamic simulation of er fluids .",
    "alternative models have been developed to circumvent the problem : the coupled - dipole model @xcite and the dipole - induced - dipole model @xcite , which take care of mutual polarization effects when the particles approach and finally touch .",
    "the did model accounts for multipolar interactions partially and is simple to use in computer simulation of er fluids @xcite .",
    "as an illustration , we employed the did model to simulate the athermal aggregation of particles in er fluids both in uniaxial and rotating fields .",
    "we find that the aggregation time is significantly reduced . in the next section , we review the multiple image method and establish the dipole - induced dipole ( did ) model . in section iii , we apply the did model to the computer simulation of er fluids in a uniaxial field . in section iv , we extend the simulation to athermal aggregation in rotating fields .",
    "discussion on our results will be given .",
    "here we briefly review the multiple images method @xcite and extend the method slightly to handle different dielectric constants . consider a pair of dielectric spheres , of radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 , dielectric constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the spheres are embedded in a host medium of dielectric constant @xmath5 . upon the application of an electric field",
    "@xmath6 , the induced dipole moment inside the spheres are respectively given by ( si units ) : @xmath7where the dipolar factors @xmath8 are given by : @xmath9 from the multiple image method @xcite , the total dipole moment inside sphere @xmath0 is : @xmath10 , \\label{trans - a - dielectric } \\\\",

    "similar expressions for the total dipole moment inside sphere @xmath1 can be obtained by interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 satisfies : @xmath16 in ref.@xcite , we checked the validity of these expressions by comparing with the integral equation method .",
    "we showed that these expression are valid at high contrast .",
    "our improved expressions will be shown to be good at low contrast as well ( see below ) .",
    "the force between the spheres is given by @xcite : @xmath17 for monodisperse er fluids ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , klingenberg defined an empirical force expression @xcite : @xmath21being normalized to the point - dipole force @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( all tending to unity at large separations ) are three force functions being determined from the numerical solution of laplace s equation .",
    "the klingenberg s force functions can be shown to relate to our multiple image moments as follow ( here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath25 ) : @xmath26where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the reduced multiple image moments of each sphere .",
    "we computed the numerical values of these force functions separately by the approximant of table i of the second reference of ref.@xcite and by eq.([klingen ] ) .    in fig.1",
    ", we plot the multiple image results and the klingenberg s empirical expressions . we show results for the perfectly conducting limit ( @xmath29 ) only . for convenience , we define the reduced separation @xmath30 . for reduced separation @xmath31 ,",
    "simple analytic expressions were adopted by klingenberg . as evident from fig.1 , the agreement with the multiple image results is impressive at large reduced separation @xmath32 , for all three empirical force functions . however , significant deviations occur for @xmath33 , especially for @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "alternative empirical expressions were adopted by klingenberg . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the agreement is impressive , although there are deviations for the other two functions . from the comparison",
    ", we would say that reasonable agreements have been obtained .",
    "thus , we are confident that the multiple image expressions give reliable results .",
    "the analytic multiple image results can be used to compare among the various models according to how many terms are retained in the multiple image expressions : ( a ) point - dipole ( pd ) model : @xmath37 term only , ( b ) dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) model : @xmath37 to @xmath38 terms only , and ( c ) multipole - induced - dipole ( mid ) model : @xmath37 to @xmath39 terms .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we examine the case of different size but equal dielectric constant ( @xmath19 ) only . here",
    "we focus on the case @xmath18 and study the effect of different dielectric constants . in fig.2",
    ", we plot the interparticle force in the longitudinal field case against the reduced separation @xmath40 between the spheres for ( a ) @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and ( b ) @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and various @xmath45 ratios . at low contrast",
    ", the did model almost coincides with the mid results .",
    "in contrast , the pd model exhibits significant deviations .",
    "it is evident that the did model generally gives better results than pd for all polydispersity .",
    "the multiple image expressions [ eqs.(3)(4 ) ] allows us to calculate the correction factor defined as the ratio between the did and pd forces : @xmath46where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the point - dipole forces for the transverse , longitudinal and @xmath50 cases respectively .",
    "these correction factors can be readily calculated in computer simulation of polydisperse er fluids .",
    "the results show that the did force deviates significantly from the pd force at high contrast when @xmath13 and @xmath14 approach unity . the dipole induced interaction will generally decrease ( increase ) the magnitude of the transverse ( longitudinal ) interparticle force with respect to the point - dipole limit .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of two equal spheres of radius @xmath0 , initially at rest and at a separation @xmath51 .",
    "an electric field is applied along the line joining the centers of the sphere .",
    "the equation of motion is given by : @xmath52where @xmath53 is the displacement of one sphere from the center of mass .",
    "the separation between the two spheres is thus @xmath54 and the initial condition is @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "eq.(11 ) is a dimensionless equation .",
    "we have chosen the following natural scales to define the dimensionless variables : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the field strength , @xmath59 is the masss , @xmath60 is the coefficient of viscosity . using typical parameters , we find @xmath61 is of the order milliseconds .",
    "we have followed klingenberg @xcite to ignore the inertial effect , captured by the parameter @xmath62 . @xmath63",
    "the neglect of @xmath62 can be justified as follows . for values common to er suspension : @xmath64 pa s , @xmath65 kg , @xmath66 m @xmath67 , the inertial term @xmath62 is of the order @xmath68 .",
    "we also neglect the thermal motion of the particles which is a valid assumption at high fields .",
    "we should remark that the initial separation @xmath51 is related to the volume fraction @xmath69 , defined as the ratio of the volume of the sphere to that of the cube which contains the sphere @xcite , i.e. @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for the pd approximation , eq.(11 ) admits an analytic solution : @xmath72^{1/5}.\\]]we integrate the equation of motion by the 4th order runge - kutta algorithm , with time steps @xmath73 and 0.001 for small and large volume fractions respectively . in fig.3(a ) , we plot the displacement @xmath74 versus time graph for the pd case and find excellent agreement between analytic and numerical results .    for the did model",
    ", we have to integrate the equation of motion numerically . in fig.4 , we plot the displacement @xmath74 versus time graph for the aggregation of two spheres in uniaxial fields . at small volume fractions ,",
    "i.e. , when the initial separation is large , the time for aggregation is large and the did results deviate slightly from the pd results . however , at large volume fractions , the did results are significantly smaller than the pd calculations .",
    "the effect becomes even more pronounced at large @xmath13 .    in fig.5(a ) , we plot the ratio of aggregation time of the did to pd cases .",
    "the results showed clearly that the aggregation time has been significantly reduced when mutual polarization effects are considered .",
    "the reduction in aggregation time becomes even pronounced for small initial separations .",
    "recently , martin and coworkers @xcite demonstrated athermal aggregation with the rotating field . when a rotating field is applied in the @xmath75-@xmath76 plane at a sufficiently high frequency that particles do not move much in one period",
    ", an average attractive dipolar interaction is created .",
    "the result of this is the formation of plates in the @xmath75-@xmath76 plane .",
    "consider a rotating field applied in the @xmath75-@xmath76 plane : @xmath77 .",
    "the dimensionless equation of motion for the two sphere case becomes : @xmath78where @xmath79 is the displacement of one sphere from the center of mass . for large @xmath80",
    ", we may safely neglect the @xmath76 component of the motion . in the pd approximation , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", we find the analytic result : @xmath83^{1/5}.\\]]the separation between the two spheres is just @xmath84 , with the initial separation @xmath55 at @xmath56 . in the rotating field case",
    ", we also integrate the equation of motion by the 4th order runge - kutta algorithm , but with @xmath85 and @xmath86 as the time steps .",
    "note that @xmath87 should be the largest time step which can be used because we must at least go through a cycle consisting of the transverse and longitudinal field cases .",
    "the oscillating effect of a rotating field is less observable when the time step is smaller than this maximum value .    in fig.3(b )",
    ", we plot the displacement versus time graph for the pd case in rotating field and find an excellent agreement between analytic and numerical results .",
    "it is evident that the aggregation time is 4 times of that of the uniaxial field case .",
    "in fact , eq.(14 ) reduces to eq.(12 ) as @xmath88 .",
    "at large @xmath80 , eq.(14 ) becomes : @xmath89^{1/5}.\\ ] ] that is , in the pd approximation , the time average force becomes 1/4 of that of the uniaxial field case .",
    "it is because the two dipole moments spend equal times in the transverse and longitudinal orientations , while @xmath90 in the pd case , leading to an overall attractive force that is 1/4 of the force of the uniaxial field case .",
    "when the multiple image force is included , we expect that the magnitude of @xmath91 increases while that of @xmath92 decreases and we expect an even larger attractive force when the spheres approach . in this case",
    ", the aggregation time must be reduced even more significantly .    in fig.5(b ) , we plot the ratio of aggregation time of the did to pd cases for @xmath29 and several @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath93 curve is just for the uniaxial field case .",
    "the results showed clearly that the aggregation time has been significantly reduced when mutual polarization effects are considered .",
    "the reduction in aggregation time becomes even pronounced for small initial separations .",
    "it is observed that fluctuations exist when the initial separation between the spheres is 2.4@xmath0 or less .",
    "it is because the motion is sensitive to the initial orientation of the dipoles when the spheres are too close .",
    "similarly , we consider the aggregations of 3 and 4 equal spheres , arranged in a chain , an equilateral triangle and a square . for a chain of 3 spheres in a rotating field ,",
    "the central sphere does not move , while the two spheres at both ends move towards the central sphere . for 3 spheres in an equilateral triangle",
    ", the center of mass ( cm ) will not move while each sphere moves towards the cm , subject to the force of the other two spheres .",
    "the same situation occurs for 4 spheres in a square , in which each sphere moves towards the cm , subject to the force of the other 3 spheres .    in the pd approximation , we report the analytic results as follows . for 3 spheres in a chain , @xmath94^{1/5}.\\]]for 3 spheres in an equilateral triangle , @xmath95^{1/5}.\\]]for 4 spheres in a square , @xmath96^{1/5}.\\]]in each of the above cases , @xmath75 is the distance of one sphere from the center of mass . in the case of 3 spheres in a chain ,",
    "the separation between the spheres is same as @xmath97 . in the case of 3 spheres in an equilateral triangle , the separation between spheres is @xmath98 . in the case of 4 spheres in a square",
    ", the separation between spheres is @xmath99 .",
    "again , we integrate the equation of motion by the 4th order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "we find excellent agreements between the analytic and numerical results ( not shown here ) .",
    "it has been found that the displacement in the @xmath76-direction is about 0.5% for @xmath100 and a larger @xmath80 has been used in the simulation . on the other hand , it is time consuming for simulations with @xmath101 .",
    "it is evident from the displacement - time graph that the results are correct . in fig.6 ,",
    "the oscillation amplitude is reduced when the rotating frequency increases in the simulation .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption made in our analytic expressions . in fig.7",
    ", it is observed that fluctuations exist when the initial separation between the spheres is 2.4@xmath0 or less in all three graphs .",
    "again , it is because the motion is sensitive to the orientation of the dipoles when the spheres are close . from the simulation ,",
    "the reduction effects become even pronounced for the rotating electric field case than the uniaxial field case .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in this work",
    ", we studied the aggregation time for several particles .",
    "we should also examine the morphology of aggregation , due to multiple image forces . in this connection",
    ", we can also examine the structural transformation by applying the uniaxial and rotating fields simultaneously @xcite .",
    "we have done simulation in the monodisperse case .",
    "real er fluids must be polydisperse in nature : the suspending particles can have various sizes or different permittivities .",
    "polydisperse electrorheological ( er ) fluids have attracted considerable interest recently because the size distribution and dielectric properties of the suspending particles can have significant impact on the er response @xcite . we should extend the simulation to polydisperse case by using the did model .    in summary",
    ", we have used the multiple image to compute the interparticle force for a polydisperse electrorheological fluid .",
    "we apply the formalism to a pair of spheres of different dielectric constants and calculate the force as a function of the separation .",
    "the results show that the point - dipole approximation is oversimplified .",
    "it errs considerably because many - body and multipolar interactions are ignored .",
    "the dipole - induced - dipole model accounts for multipolar interactions partially and yields overall satisfactory results in computer simulation of er fluids while it is easy to use .",
