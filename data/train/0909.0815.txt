    "@xcite measured the time - dependent current through a quantum point contact when a pulse generator is coupled to the input lead .",
    "the output signal was measured for different amplitudes and rise times of the pulse .",
    "the decay of the output current was roughly exponential and it was suggested that such a device could be used as a microwave circuit element . in another recent experiment lai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed transient current measurements for a ge quantum dot when trapezoidal voltage pulses were applied to one electrode .",
    "the transient current mimics the pulse shape and the extracted time - dependent occupation number in the system follows an accumulation / depletion cycle .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "the transient currents have been calculated by various methods .",
    "@xcite combined the keldysh formalism and the density functional theory to study the response of a nanostructure to a time - dependent bias between the leads . in the partitioning approach",
    "the transient currents induced through a few - level quantum dot by a modulation of the contacts between the leads and the sample was calculated in ref . and",
    "a scattering theory of the time - dependent magnetotransport in a long quantum wire was proposed in ref .. these studies were essentially focused on understanding the transient regime and the onset of the steady - state .",
    "therefore the time - dependent driving used in the calculations did not describe pulsed signals , but rather an initial switching stage followed by a constant , time - independent value .",
    "in particular sudden coupling or smooth coupling lead to qualitatively different output signals . another problem considered in the time - dependent transport calculations",
    "is the quantum pumping .",
    "@xcite in this case one obtains averaged currents through an unbiased system which is perturbed by _ two _ time - dependent potentials oscillating out - of - phase .    in this work",
    "we discuss transport calculations for a mesoscopic sample driven out of equilibrium by both a constant bias applied between the leads and a fast oscillating signal applied at the contact between the lead and the sample . if the signal has a rectangular shape the setup is in some sense similar to the pump - and - probe configuration used in the transient spectroscopy experiments of fujisawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the time - dependent signal was applied on the sample and the main aim was to extract the spin relaxation time by pushing _",
    "one _ excited state into the transport window during the pulse .",
    "here we discuss the transient response of the system from a different angle : if a sequence of rectangular pulses that modulate the coupling to the left lead is viewed as an input signal then one can study the propagation of this signal trough the system and the corresponding current in the right ( i.e.output ) lead .",
    "our problem is therefore closer to the experiments by naser _",
    "_ @xcite and lai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite besides the very ambitious goal of assembling quantum dot structures in complex mesoscopic circuits operating like quantum gates we believe there is another important motivation for such a study .",
    "the transient response of the sample to the modulation of the contact is a consequence of the internal electron dynamics which depends crucially on the electronic states participating in transport .",
    "the point is that by changing the bias applied on the system one selects different states in the transport window and then the output current may carry important informations about the electron dynamics in the sample .",
    "even if the level structure of the sample may be known from other type of measurements , the tunneling rates associated to each quantum state or the propagation properties of the orbitals are not easily understood .",
    "we aim at describing the following transport experiment through a mesoscopic structure : the contact between the sample and the left lead opens and closes periodically by applying rectangular pulses on the metallic gates that define the contact region . at the same time",
    "the contact between the sample and the right lead gradually opens .",
    "then each time the left contact closes the electrons in the sample can only escape into the right lead .",
    "these relaxation processes of various states in the sample depend mainly on the corresponding tunneling rates which in turn are given by the coupling of the states to the output contact . in real samples",
    "the states that participate in transport have different tunneling coefficients and therefore it is not obvious that the relaxation current follows a simple exponential decay . we show that the transient response of the sample is in general more complex . sometimes the output current may look exponential , but often may also carry a fine structure reflecting the presence of several quantum states propagating through the sample and various relaxation processes corresponding to transitions between these states and the right lead .    a recent attempt to describe rectangular pulses in quantum dots",
    "was made by oh",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite their sample model was a two - level quantum dot and for transport calculations they used rate equations with time - dependent tunneling coefficients . instead , our calculations are done using the generalized non - markovian master equation ( gme ) approach presented in one of our recent works .",
    "@xcite we take into account the geometry of the system and its spectral properties which determine the tunneling coefficients and therefore the currents driven by the external bias .",
    "the application of the gme method to quantum transport received attention in the last years in the context of transient currents , measurement theory or full - counting statistics or coherent control of transport ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "the content of the paper is organized as follows : the formalism is briefly explained in section ii , the numerical simulations are reported in section iii , and the main conclusions are included in section iv .",
    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonian of the system , the underlying notations , and we summarize the main equations derived in our previous work ref .. we consider a mesoscopic system which is coupled to two leads at @xmath0 and described by the following second - quantized hamiltonian ( @xmath1 denotes hermitian conjugation ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are creation and destruction operators for electrons with momentum @xmath7 and energy @xmath8 in the lead @xmath9 , and with energy @xmath10 in the sample , respectively .",

    "the third term is the tunneling hamiltonian and contains the time - dependent switching functions @xmath13 and the coupling matrix elements @xmath14 associated to each pair of states @xmath15 from the leads and the sample .",
    "the pulses applied at the contact region between the left lead and the sample are simulated by the function @xmath16 which by construction has a rectangular shape .",
    "although our formalism could also be implemented for a continuous model ( see ref . ) here we use a lattice model for which the matrix elements are given by ( see ref . ( ) ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coupling strength between the lead @xmath9 and the sample , @xmath19 is the site of the lead @xmath9 which couples to the contact site @xmath20 in the sample .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the sample @xmath21 and the corresponding energies @xmath10 are numerically computed while those in the leads , @xmath22 and @xmath8 are known analytically : @xmath23 @xmath24 being the hopping constant on leads .",
    "we emphasize that even in this simple lattice model the coupling matrix elements introduced in eq.([tqn ] ) depend both on the energy and of the localization of the sample states .",
    "a similar model for the transfer hamiltonian was proposed by maddox _",
    "@xcite    the statistical operator of the open quantum system is denoted by @xmath25 and solves the liouville equation : @xmath26 $ ] , with the initial condition @xmath27 .",
    "this means that before the coupling the sample is described by the statistical operator @xmath28 defined just below , and the leads are characterized by equilibrium distributions @xmath29 with different chemical potentials @xmath30 .",
    "the many - body states of the system are described by the sequence of occupation numbers of the single - particle states @xmath31 for the isolated system .",

    "similarly , @xmath54 is selected such that all states with higher energy are permanently empty .",
    "consequently the states outside this energy window do not contribute to the current .",
    "based on this picture we conclude that it is sufficient to compute an effective reduced density matrix by taking into account only those many - body configurations resulting from the single particle states within the active window . also for the simplicity of notation we shall specify in the many - body states only the occupation numbers of the single - particle states within the active window .",
    "of course , the validity of this truncation should be checked in the numerical simulations by gradually enlarging the active window @xmath50 $ ] until the calculated currents become stable .",

    "but it is also possible that this electron remains in the sample , while another electron , from another state , say the 4th , tunnels back into the left lead ; escaping into the left lead from the 4th state is more likely than in the right lead because the chemical potential @xmath98 is much closer to @xmath100 ( @xmath116 ) than @xmath95 .",
    "repeated tunneling from highest state of the sample towards different leads and back into the sample lead to the charging of the lower states at the expense of the higher ones .",
    "consequently the output currents associated to the lower states 1 and 2 are increasing , see fig.5(a ) , whereas the output current @xmath120 decreases .",
    "note also that the net input current @xmath123 is smaller than @xmath121 and @xmath122 because there are more electrons tunneling out from the level @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast , when the pulse is turned off , the charge on the 4th level leaves the sample only via the output lead and therefore @xmath120 increase as shown in fig.5(a ) . on the other hand",
    "the tunneling processes from the left lead to the lowest levels are switched off and so @xmath118 and @xmath119 decrease on the relaxation interval .    for comparison",

    "for the two - level configuration the partial occupation numbers display similar charging / relaxation shapes .",

    "@xmath111 ps,@xmath151 and @xmath114.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for completeness we give in figs.8(a)-(c ) the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix , known as `` coherences '' , which are related to the transitions between different states .",
    "for example @xmath152 ( fig.8(a ) ) describes the process in which electrons can tunnel from the 4th state into the leads and then back to the sample on the 1st state .",
    "we see that the real and imaginary parts of the coherences have oscillations and change sign",
    ". moreover , the oscillations are more complex if the matrix element implies single particle states separated by other energy levels .",
    "indeed , by comparing @xmath153 and @xmath154 we see that the latter displays two minima and two maxima in the charging time interval , while @xmath153 has only one minimum .",
    "this feature suggests again that electrons make transitions via intermediate single - particle states as follows : initial state @xmath155 intermediate state @xmath155 leads @xmath155 final state .",
    "we have checked that coherences between states with only one intermediate state in between ( e.g.  @xmath156 ) have only one maximum and one minimum .",
    "another remark is that the oscillations of @xmath157 have a higher amplitude than the other two coherences , which is consistent to the fact that the two configurations @xmath131 and @xmath158 are the most probable ones in the stationary regime .",
    "fig.8(c ) shows that the 3rd level is very weakly coupled to the level below , which is expected since that state is poorly coupled to the leads . by increasing the pulse width the number of oscillations during the pulse generally increases as more and more transitions may occur .",
    "also , two - particle configurations will develop , while the probability of the single - particle states decrease ( not shown ) .",
    "it should be mentioned here that in the non - markovian approach the coherences also contribute to the currents because they are coupled to the diagonal elements of @xmath159 .",
    "we continue with similar results for a different sample , a narrow 40 nm @xmath160 160 nm quantum wire described by a @xmath161 sites lattice .",
    "the system has now 100 eigenstates and it is connected to two three - channel leads on both narrow sides .",
    "for simplicity we consider uncoupled channels , which means the electrons can not jump between the channels .",
    "the chemical potentials of the leads are @xmath151 and @xmath162 ; they cover three states now , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( or @xmath166 respectively ) which we also consider as the active window .",
    "the coupling of these states to the leads is much stronger than in the previous case .",
    "fig.9(a ) shows the input / output characteristics for a pulse of length @xmath167 ps .",
    "we see that the total currents become equal in the second half of the pulse .",
    "this means that the stationary state is practically reached before the left contact is switched off .",
    "after that the output current is delayed with respect to the input current .",
    "this delay corresponds to the propagation of electrons along the sample .",
    "we have checked this by estimating the time needed by one electron having the energy @xmath168 to travel along the wire ; we obtain that the traveling time is around 2 ps which agrees with the numerical results .",
    "the input current has a sharp transient maximum as the left contact opens , but this behavior is not transferred to the output current which is rather flat .",
    "again the relaxation input current has a step after a fast decay .",
    "the occupation numbers of the three states within the bias window are shown in fig.9(b ) and explain the origin of the step .",
    "the two higher states depopulate quite fast in the first half of the relaxation interval , but at some point their depletion suddenly slows down .",
    "this suggests that the relaxation rates are governed by time - dependent tunneling rates depending on the coupling to the leads , but also on the occupation number of the states .",
    "remark that the bias window becomes empty before another pulse rises up .",
    "the rise time of the pulse can be varied in experiments ( see ref . ) . in our model",
    "the rise time depends on the smoothness parameter @xmath83 used to create the pulses . in fig.9(c ) we show the total input and output currents for a pulse with a larger rise time corresponding to @xmath150 .",
    "the transient maxima in the input current softens and so does the additional shoulder in the relaxation current .",
    "note however that during the pulse the output current takes the same value ( around 60 pa ) and it is still delayed w.r.t.to the input current .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the coulomb interaction which is neglected here .",
    "the numerical results show that the occupation number of the levels within the active window is quite low for the rather large samples considered ( see e.g. figs.6(a ) and ( b ) ) . in this case one",
    "expects that the coulomb interaction between electrons located in the active states causes very small changes in the transient currents . on the other hand",
    ", the coulomb repulsion generated by the inactive states which are fully occupied could be important , leading at least to a hartree shift of the active levels .",
    "however , the relaxation processes and the modulation of the output current should be qualitatively similar .",
    "we have analyzed the transient response of a two - dimensional nanosystem to a sequence of periodic rectangular pulses which modulate the contact to the source lead . by solving the generalized non - markovian master equation for the reduced density matrix we have been able to discuss the dependence of the input / output characteristics on the pulse length for two specific systems : a rather large quantum dot and a narrow quantum wire .",
    "we have considered a pump - and - probe setup in which the contact to the left lead opens and closes periodically while the right lead is always connected to the system . when the contact is switched off",
    "the drain current reflects the relaxation processes in the sample .",
    "we have discussed these processes by analyzing the single - particle currents , the diagonal , and off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix . at a low temperature",
    "the phonon effects could be neglected and the main relaxation processes are back - and - forth tunnelings to and from the leads .    in both cases ( the dot and the wire ) we have found that the pulse length can be adjusted such that the shape of the pulse can be reproduced by the output signal . by increasing the chemical potential of the source lead the current profile in the output lead develops additional oscillations related to the relaxation of the higher energy states included in the bias window . in the case of a narrow quantum wire a delay of the output current with respect to the input signal has been obtained .",
    "this study was partly motivated by the recent experiments of naser _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and lai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite although those experiments were done with larger and longer pulses our results qualitatively agree with the reported features of the transient response .",
    "in particular the time - dependent occupation number clearly show a charging / relaxation behavior as in the work of lai _ et al . _",
