    "in various physical applications including those in nuclear physics and high energy physics [ 1,2 ] , one of the interesting problems is to obtain exact solutions of the relativistic equations like klein - gordon and dirac equations for mixed vector and scalar potential .",
    "the klein - gordon and dirac wave equations are frequently used to describe the particle dynamics in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the klein - gordon equation has also been used to understand the motion of a spin-@xmath1 particle in large class of potentials . in recent years",
    ", much efforts have been paid to solve these relativistic wave equations for various potentials by using different methods .",
    "these relativistic equations contain two objects : the four - vector linear momentum operator and the scalar rest mass .",
    "they allow us to introduce two types of potential coupling , which are the four - vector potential ( v ) and the space - time scalar potential ( s ) .",
    "recently , many authors have worked on solving these equations with physical potentials including morse potential [ 3 ] , hulthen potential [ 4 ] , woods - saxon potential [ 5 ] , psch - teller potential [ 6 ] , reflectionless - type potential [ 7 ] , pseudoharmonic oscillator [ 8 ] , ring - shaped harmonic oscillator [ 9 ] , @xmath2 potential [ 10 ] , five - parameter exponential potential [ 11 ] , rosen - morse potential [ 12 ] , and generalized symmetrical double - well potential [ 13 ] , etc .",
    "it is remarkable that in most works in this area , the scalar and vector potentials are almost taken to be equal ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) [ 2,14 ] .",
    "however , in some few other cases , it is considered the case where the scalar potential is greater than the vector potential ( in order to guarantee the existence of klein - gordon bound states ) ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) [ 15 - 19 ] .",
    "nonetheless , such physical potentials are very few .",
    "the bound - state solutions for the last case is obtained for the exponential potential for the @xmath5-wave klein - gordon equation when the scalar potential is greater than the vector potential [ 15 ] .",
    "the study of exact solutions of the nonrelativistic equation for a class of non - central potentials with a vector potential and a non - central scalar potential is of considerable interest in quantum chemistry [ 20 - 22 ] . in recent years",
    ", numerous studies [ 23 ] have been made in analyzing the bound states of an electron in a coulomb field with simultaneous presence of aharanov - bohm ( ab ) [ 24 ] field , and/or a magnetic dirac monopole [ 25 ] , and aharanov - bohm plus oscillator ( abo ) systems . in most of these works ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by means of seperation of variables in spherical or other orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems .",
    "the path integral for particles moving in non - central potentials is evaluated to derive the energy spectrum of this system analytically [ 26 ] .",
    "in addition , the idea of susy and shape invariance is also used to obtain exact solutions of such non - central but seperable potentials [ 27,28 ] .",
    "very recently , the conventional nikiforov - uvarov ( nu ) method [ 29 ] has been used to give a clear recipe of how to obtain an explicit exact bound - states solutions for the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials for a class of non - central potentials [ 30 ] .",
    "another type of noncentral potentials is the ring - shaped kratzer potential , which is a combination of a coulomb potential plus an inverse square potential plus a noncentral angular part [ 31,32 ] .",
    "the kratzer potential has been used to describe the vibrational - rotational motion of isolated diatomic molecules [ 33 ] and has a mixed - energy spectrum containing both bound and scattering states with bound - states have been widely used in molecular spectroscopy [ 34 ] .",
    "the ring - shaped kratzer potential consists of radial and angular - dependent potentials and is useful in studying ring - shaped molecules [ 22 ] . in taking the relativistic effects into account for spin-@xmath1 particle in the presence of a class of noncentral potentials , yasuk _",
    "et al _ [ 35 ] applied the nu method to solve the klein - gordon equation for the noncentral coulombic ring - shaped potential [ 21 ] for the case @xmath6 further , berkdemir [ 36 ] also used the same method to solve the klein - gordon equation for the kratzer - type potential .",
    "recently , chen and dong [ 37 ] proposed a new ring - shaped potential and obtained the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the coulomb potential plus this new ring - shaped potential which has possible applications to ring - shaped organic molecules like cyclic polyenes and benzene .",
    "this type of potential used by chen and dong [ 37 ] appears to be very similar to the potential used by yasuk _",
    "et al _ [ 35 ] .",
    "moreover , cheng and dai [ 38 ] , proposed a new potential consisting from the modified kratzer s potential [ 33 ] plus the new proposed ring - shaped potential in [ 37 ] .",
    "they have presented the energy eigenvalues for this proposed exactly - solvable non - central potential in three dimensional @xmath7i.e . , @xmath8-schrdinger equation by means of the nu method .",
    "the two quantum systems solved by refs [ 37,38 ] are closely relevant to each other as they deal with a coulombic field interaction except for a slight change in the angular momentum barrier acts as a repulsive core which is for any arbitrary angular momentum @xmath9 prevents collapse of the system in any dimensional space due to the slight perturbation to the original angular momentum barrier .",
    "very recently , we have also applied the nu method to solve the schrdinger equation in any arbitrary @xmath0-dimension to this new modified kratzer - type potential [ 39,40 ] .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to consider the relativistic effects for the spin-@xmath1 particle in our recent works [ 39,40 ] .",
    "so we want to present a systematic recipe to solving the @xmath0-dimensional klein - gordon equation for the kratzer plus the new ring - shaped potential proposed in [ 38 ] using the simple nu method .",
    "this method is based on solving the klein - gordon equation by reducing it to a generalized hypergeometric equation .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ tkg ] , we shall present the klein - gordon equation in spherical coordinates for spin-@xmath1 particle in the presence of equal scalar and vector noncentral kratzer plus the new ring - shaped potential and we also separate it into radial and angular parts .",
    "section [ num ] is devoted to a brief description of the nu method . in section [ es ] , we present the exact solutions to the radial and angular parts of the klein - gordon equation in @xmath0-dimensions . finally , the relevant conclusions are given in section [ c ] .",
    "in relativistic quantum mechanics , we usually use the klein - gordon equation for describing a scalar particle , i.e. , the spin-@xmath1 particle dynamics .",
    "the discussion of the relativistic behavior of spin - zero particles requires understanding the single particle spectrum and the exact solutions to the klein gordon equation which are constructed by using the four - vector potential @xmath10 @xmath11 and the scalar potential @xmath12 . in order to simplify the solution of the klein - gordon equation",
    ", the four - vector potential can be written as @xmath13 the first component of the four - vector potential is represented by a vector potential @xmath14 i.e. , @xmath15 in this case , the motion of a relativistic spin-@xmath1 particle in a potential is described by the klein - gordon equation with the potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 [ 1]@xmath18 for the case @xmath19 there exist bound - state ( real ) solutions for a relativistic spin - zero particle [ 15 - 19 ] . on the other hand , for @xmath20 the klein - gordon equation reduces to a schrdinger - like equation and thereby the bound - state solutions are easily obtained by using the well - known methods developed in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics [ 2 ] .",
    "the klein - gordon equation describing a scalar particle ( spin-@xmath1 particle ) with scalar @xmath21 and vector @xmath22 potentials is given by [ 2,14 ]    @xmath23 ^{2}+\\left [ \\mu + s(r,\\theta , \\varphi ) /2\\right ] ^{2}\\right\\ } \\psi ( r,\\theta , \\varphi ) = 0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the relativistic energy , momentum operator and rest mass of the particle , respectively .",
    "the potential terms are scaled in ( 1 ) by alhaidari _",
    "et al _ [ 14 ] so that in the nonrelativistic limit the interaction potential becomes @xmath26    in this work , we consider the equal scalar and vector potentials case , that is , @xmath27 with the recently proposed general non - central potential taken in the form of the kratzer plus ring - shaped potential [ 38 - 40 ] : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 is positive real constant with @xmath33 is the dissociation energy and @xmath34 is the equilibrium internuclear distance [ 33 ] . the potentials in eq .",

    "equations ( 6)-(8 ) have the same functional form as eqs ( 10)-(12 ) .",
    "therefore , the solution of the klein - gordon equation can be reduced to the solution of the schrdinger equation with the appropriate choice of parameters :  @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58    the solution of eq .",

    "the nu method is based on reducing the second - order differential equation to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type [ 29 ] . in this sense , the schrdinger equation , after employing an appropriate coordinate transformation @xmath61 transforms to the following form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are polynomials , at most of second - degree , and @xmath65 is a first - degree polynomial . using a wave function , @xmath66 of  the simple ansatz :    @xmath67    reduces ( 14 ) into an equation of a hypergeometric type    @xmath68    where    @xmath69    @xmath70    and @xmath71 is a parameter defined as @xmath72 the polynomial @xmath73 with the parameter @xmath5 and prime factors show the differentials at first degree be negative .",
