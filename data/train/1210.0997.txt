    "hexagonal ferrites were intensely studied for permanent magnets and microwave absorber applications . the former related to their easy axis anisotropy configuration ( e.g. in m - ferrites ) , the latter to an easy plane one ( e.g. in y - ferrites ) @xcite . moreover , w - type ferrites undergo spin reorientation transitions ( srt ) between states of different anisotropy on varying temperature @xcite and applied magnetic field @xcite . in spite of the lesser magnitude of the anisotropy - driven magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , with respect to other materials where entropy change is associated with a change in the spontaneous magnetisation , these transitions show unique properties due to the vectorial nature of anisotropy related phenomena . the entropy change associated with srt can be actually achieved by changing the direction of the applied magnetic field ( i.e. by a rotating field ) instead of changing its amplitude .",
    "another relevant advantage of ferrites , with respect to other alloys @xcite , is that they contain no critical rare - earth elements .",
    "the structure of the * w * ferrites is built up by mixing the unit cells of the magnetoplumbite * m * , with chemical composition bafe@xmath11o@xmath12 , and that of the spinel * s * , me@xmath13fe@xmath14o@xmath15 .",
    "a detailed description of this structure can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the possibility to tune the srt temperature by changing the proportion between the co and zn substitutions @xcite and its structural origin have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the system undergoes a srt transition from a low temperature easy plane ( ep ) configuration to an high temperature easy axis ( ea ) at a temperature @xmath16 that increases with co concentration @xmath17 . for the @xmath18 composition that we investigate here , the transition takes place at about @xmath19 k .",
    "as the magnetic field induced srt requires the presence of a well - defined orientation of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , the effect can be detected both in single crystal , and in aligned polycrystalline samples . in this paper",
    "we shall limit our study to single crystal , where the entropy change is expected to be greater .",
    "comparison with polycrystalline textured samples will be presented elsewhere .",
    "single crystals of composition baco@xmath1zn@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 have been grown using a flux method @xcite .",
    "the starting mixture was prepared from baco@xmath20 , coo , zno , fe@xmath13o@xmath20 and na@xmath13co@xmath20 powders .",
    "the charge was packed into a platinum crucible and heated up to 1350 @xmath21c .",
    "the melt was homogenized at this temperature for 24 h , slowly cooled down to 1000 @xmath21c at 3 @xmath21c / h and more rapidly to room temperature .",
    "crystal structures were examined by panalytical xpert pro x - ray diffractometer ( xrd ) in co - k@xmath22 radiation with xcelerator detector for rapid data acquisition .",
    "we performed measurements on a sample of mass @xmath23 mg and of lateral size of a few millimetres . due to the shape of the sample we estimated the demagnetising factors parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis to be respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "isothermal entropy change has been measured using a home - made calorimetric set - up with thin film peltier cells ( micropelt mpg d751 ) as heat flux sensors , working in the temperature range @xmath26 k by using an oxford microstat he cryostat with liquid nitrogen ( a similar set - up working around room temperature is described in @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field is generated by an electromagnet ( up to @xmath27 t maximum ) .",
    "the measurements are performed by keeping the temperature stable to the desired value , and meanwhile by measuring the heat flux @xmath28 during application and removal of the magnetic field ( up to @xmath29 t ) at a rate of @xmath30 ts@xmath31 .",
    "after correction of the measured heat flux for dynamic effects due to the heat transfer in the peltier cell @xcite and an eventual offset due to non ideal isothermal conditions , the magnetic field induced entropy change is deduced by integrating @xmath28 over time .",
    "the result of the integration is represented versus the applied field @xmath32 . in fig.[fig : s_hpar ] and fig.[fig : s_hperp ] the entropy change , measured by applying the magnetic field respectively parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis , are shown in a range of temperatures spanning from @xmath33 k to @xmath34 k. in both cases we observe two different classes of @xmath35 curves .",
    "the first is linear , @xmath36 , with negative slope @xmath37 .",
    "the second is composed by two regimes : a quadratic one with @xmath38 , from @xmath39 up to a field value that we shall call @xmath40 ; a linear one with @xmath41 , when @xmath42",
    ". the purely linear behaviour is observed in the temperature range where the field is directed along the zero - field equilibrium configuration of the sample .",
    "the double regime is observed at temperatures where the field is applied perpendicular to the equilibrium state and therefore a field driven srt , whose maximum entropy change is @xmath43 , takes place . from fig .",
    "[ eq : spar ] and [ eq : sperp ] we see that @xmath43 is positive under application of @xmath32 parallel to @xmath5 for temperatures below about @xmath9 k. this corresponds to a transition from a low entropy ep configuration toward a high entropy ea one . on",
    "the contrary @xmath43 is negative when @xmath32 is[multiblock footnote omitted ] perpendicular to @xmath5 and the temperature is above @xmath9 k. this corresponds to a transition from ea ( high entropy ) to ep ( low entropy ) . in the main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsk ] the entropy change @xmath43 ( i.e. the entropy change measured at a certain temperature under application of a saturating magnetic field after subtraction of the @xmath44 term ) is plotted against temperature when the applied field is parallel ( triangles ) and perpendicular ( circles ) to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the difference between the two curves , @xmath45 ( continuous line ) is plotted too.the presence of an intermediate temperature range , between @xmath9 k and @xmath10 k , where @xmath43 depends on temperature is apparent .",
    "the absence of detectable latent heat anomaly in dsc scans suggests that this intermediate region should be rather associated with the presence of an easy cone intermediate phase than with the phase coexistence region of a first order transition .",
    "the maximum entropy change at the reorientation is @xmath46 jkg@xmath31k@xmath31 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsk ] shows an effective anisotropy field @xmath47 , plotted against temperature , obtained from @xmath48 after subtraction of the demagnetising field . we shall discuss the meaning of this anisotropy in the following section .     measured at different fixed temperatures by applying and removing a field of @xmath29 t parallel to the @xmath5 axis . ]     measured at different fixed temperatures by applying and removing a field of @xmath29 t perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis . ]     in saturating parallel ( green triangles ) and perpendicular ( red circles ) fields and difference between the two curves ( continuous line ) .",
    "inset : equivalent anisotropy as deduced from the measured @xmath49 ( green triangles ) and @xmath50 ( red squares ) as a function of temperature ]",
    "the system free energy with anisotropy term developed till the third order writes :      where @xmath52 is the angle between the magnetisation @xmath53 and the @xmath5 axis , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the components of @xmath56 respectively parallel and perpendicular to @xmath5 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the anisotropy constants , and @xmath60 is a term depending on temperature only .",
    "the entropy of the system under a saturating field directed along the @xmath5 axis ( @xmath61 ) is :          now , whatever the initial state @xmath65 ( i.e. the @xmath66 entropy at a fixed temperature ) from which the @xmath35 measurements are performed , @xmath65 will be nothing but a function of @xmath67 .",
    "so under saturating applied field ( i.e. when @xmath68 ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spar ] ) and ( [ eq : sperp ] ) we can deduce that @xmath69 . by fitting the linear part in the field region where @xmath68 we obtain @xmath70 am@xmath31 , in good agreement with values from the literature @xcite . using the @xmath71 value and eq .",
    "( [ eq : spar ] ) and ( [ eq : sperp ] ) we can subtract from @xmath72 the contribution of paraprocesses and plot the srt contribution to the entropy change @xmath43 in parallel and perpendicular @xmath32 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spar ] ) and ( [ eq : sperp ] ) their difference is @xmath73 . from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsk ] we find that @xmath74 with a slight negative slope .    now , let us discuss the fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 , representing the @xmath32 value where @xmath35 pass from the quadratic regime to the linear one . during a uniform rotation of the magnetization driven by @xmath32 , the system reaches saturation when the applied field overcomes both the demagnetising and the anisotropy field .",
    "therefore , for a rotation from the easy plane towards the @xmath5 axis ( i.e. the parallel field case ) we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 , whereas when magnetisation rotates from the @xmath5 axis to the plane , @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "it is worth recalling that , in the case where @xmath81 , the quadratic expression @xmath82 for @xmath83 can be deduced rigorously from expression ( [ eq : gl ] ) @xcite .",
    "when @xmath58 and @xmath59 can not be neglected , stable zero - field easy - cone configuration may exist , and a simple expression for @xmath35 ( when @xmath83 ) can be hardly worked out . notwithstanding",
    "this limitation our measured @xmath35 curves actually show a quadratic and a linear regime as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : s_hpar ] and [ fig : s_hperp ] .",
    "so we must just keep in mind that identification of @xmath48 is theoretically founded near room temperature , whereas it represents just a phenomenological fitting procedure for lower temperatures . from @xmath48 , by subtracting the demagnetising field , we can calculate the value of @xmath84 and @xmath85 and therefore we can respectively work out two anisotropies : @xmath86 ( red circles in the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : dsk ] ) and @xmath57 ( green triangles in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsk ] ) . as higher order anisotropy constants",
    "are expected to vanish at room temperature , from the value of @xmath87 at @xmath6 k we can directly estimate @xmath88 jm@xmath8 , in good agreement with the literature @xcite . by fitting @xmath89 and @xmath90 together with a linear function",
    "we obtain : @xmath91 jkg@xmath31 .",
    "this result is rather intriguing as , from magnetic measurements , it is generally argued that at low temperature higher order anisotropy constants should not be negligible @xcite .",
    "however , values and sign of the anisotropy constants deduced from magnetic and torque measurements are often conflicting @xcite .",
    "indeed , the calorimetric measurement we present here , can be rather well described by using just one equivalent anisotropy constant that changes its sign at @xmath19 k , inside the temperature interval where the srt takes place .",
    "discrepancies between the values of @xmath92 deduced from @xmath76 ( red circles ) and from @xmath75 ( green triangles ) are apparent around @xmath9 k. moreover , the slope of @xmath47 is constant , @xmath93 jkg@xmath31k@xmath31 , whereas from @xmath94 we found that @xmath95 presents a slight negative slope .",
    "this can be ascribed as due to the contribution of higher order constant .",
    "further investigation on this issue will be focused on temperature dependence of magnetisation curves and on more detailed theoretical calculations .    concluding : we presented a detailed experimental investigation on srt associated entropy change in w - type hexaferrite covering a wide temperature range .",
    "the data , the first in our knowledge obtained by direct calorimetry , allow to identify : the temperature interval where the transition takes place , the maximum entropy change associated with srt , and can be described using a single anisotropy constant @xmath92 model where @xmath92 changes sign at the transition temperature . further investigation will be devoted to the role of higher anisotropy constants .      1 j. smit and h.p .",
