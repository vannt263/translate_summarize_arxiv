    "asca discovered a broad and skewed emission line feature around 57 kev in the spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 for the first time ( tanaka et al .",
    "the iron line is emitted as a part of the reflection spectrum from the accretion disk , irradiated by a primary continuum of the central engine .",
    "fabian et al . ( 1989 ) suggested that the iron line due to disk reflection is in general broadened and skewed by the doppler effects and gravitational redshift if the line is emitted in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "in fact , the iron line profile observed with asca is well explained with such a `` disk - line '' model ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "meanwhile , fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported significant _",
    "invariability _ in the iron line energy band of mcg 6 - 30 - 15 in xmm - newton and asca observations , respectively .",
    "inoue and matsumoto ( 2003 ) pointed out that the absorbed spectrum due to photoionized warm absorbers mimics the shape of the strongly red - shifted iron line , and that variation of the warm absorbers may explain such invariability in the iron line region . on the other hand , miniutti and fabian ( 2004 ) proposed that the observed invariability of the iron line may be explained if the disk reflection and line photon production takes place very close to the black hole , such that the apparent invariability of the iron line is due to general relativistic light - bending effects .",
    "in fact , miniutti et al . (",
    "2007 ) claim that the strong reflection , the broad iron line and invariability of the iron line observed with suzaku may be explained with the light - bending model , and suggest that the innermost disk radius extends down to about as low as two gravitational radii .",
    "meanwhile , niedwiecki & ycki ( 2008 ) independently re - examined the light - bending model and concluded that it is indeed possible that a reflected component is very weakly variable compared to the primary emission , if a source is moving _ radially _ very close to the rotating black hole , while whether such a particular movement is plausible or not is another question .    on the other hand ,",
    "a similarly weakly variable , _ apparently broad _ fe line in ngc 4151 is most likely to be an artifact of incorrect modelling of the absorbers , and the spectrum is in fact dominated by a narrow emission line ( ogle et al .",
    "2000 ; de rosa et al .",
    "2007 ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "takahashi , inoue , and dotani ( 2002 ) confirmed , from a very long rxte monitoring data , an unambiguous evidence that the reverberation of the iron line emission takes place not in the vicinity of the central black hole but very far from the black hole ( @xmath1 cm ) .",
    "therefore , at least in ngc 4151 , most iron line photons are produced very far from the black hole and thus invariable on a timescale of @xmath2 sec . in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 too , young et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported a weak and narrow emission line at 6.4 kev , which indicates that some reflection does take place in a distant material , e.g. , the narrow - line region or the pc - scale torus .",
    "however , equivalent width of the narrow line in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath3 ev ) is much smaller than in ngc 4151 ( @xmath4 2 kev ; takahashi , inoue and dotani 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , invariability of the apparently broadened iron line feature in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 has yet to be explained .",
    "the question in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is thus whether the fe line is broad and its lack of variability is a result of the relativistic effect , or it is rather narrow , comes from a distant and extended medium , which would naturally smear the variability .",
    "the crucial element to address the problem is to model the underlying continuum spectrum and study its variation .",
    "the broad band continuum in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is complex , with strong modification from warm absorbers ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 , otani et al .",
    "1996 , lee et al .",
    "2001 , sako et al .  2003 ,",
    "turner et al .  2003 , turner et al.2004 , young et al .  2005 , miller et al .  2008 ) .",
    "moreover , the continuum spectral shape is variable , and the spectral variation is suggested to be driven mostly by variations of the complex warm absorbers ( miller et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this paper",
    "we attempt to comprehensively characterize the spectral variability of the source in a model independent manner as much as possible .",
    "we characterize spectral variations at different timescales , as well as at different source flux levels .",
    "we use suzaku data taken in jan 2006 ( total exposure time is 339 ksec ) for this purpose .",
    "suzaku s broad energy coverage ( 0.640 kev ) , excellent spectral resolution and a large effective area , make it an ideal instrument to study spectral variation of moderately bright agns such as mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "our goal is to find a reasonable spectral model of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 which is able to explain the observed spectral variation at various timescales with minimum numbers of parameters , and to study effects of warm absorbers .",
    "such a reasonable spectral model is very needed to disentangle the tough disk - line problem , since the broad iron line feature is affected by the choice of continuum spectral models .",
    "the suzaku satellite ( mitsuda et al . 2007 ) has observed mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath5 = 0.00775 ; fisher et al .",
    "1995 ) four times .",
    "the first observation was performed between august 1719 in 2005 for about 45 ksec . in 2006 january , the source was observed three times , between 914 ( 143 ksec exposure ) , 2326 ( 99 ksec ) , and 2730 ( 97 ksec ) . in this paper , we use the data taken in 2006 january .    for data reduction we used the headas 6.5 software package , provided by nasa / gsfc .",
    "the xis data were screened with xselect using the standard criterion ( koyama et al .",
    "the xis spectra and light - curves were extracted from circular regions of 3.82 arcmin radius centred on the source , while background products were extracted from the outer annulus region with a total area being equal to that of the source region .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure2.ps    we generated xis response matrices using the xisrmfgen software , which takes into account the time - variation of the energy response .",
    "as for generating ancillary response files ( arfs ) , we used xissimarfgen ( ishisaki et al .",
    "this tool calculates arfs through ray - tracing , and we selected the number of input photons as 400000 , with the `` estepfile '' parameter `` full '' .    after extracting the products for the back - illuminated ccd ( xis1 ) and for the three front - illuminated ccd xis detectors ( xis0 , xis2 , xis3 )",
    "separately , we found the xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 products are almost identical to each other .",
    "so we combined the xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 products in our analysis .",
    "we used the addascaspec to combine the xis spectra and responses .",
    "as for hxd / pin ( takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , instrumental background model is provided by the hxd instrument team in the form of simulated pin event files .",
    "these background event files do not contain the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) component , which we estimated separately using the pin response for flat emission distribution ( ae@xmath6hxd@xmath6pinflate1@xmath620080129.rsp ) assuming the cxb spectrum measured by heao-1 ( boldt 1987 ) .",
    "first , in this section , we study the time - average spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 to find a physically plausible spectral model .",
    "then , in the following sections , we will use the same spectral model to see which parameters are variable to explain the observed spectral variation ( sections [ sec : slicespectra ] and [ sec : brightfaint ] ) .",
    "the spectral model we adopt is the following ; ( 1 ) power - law with an exponential cut - off , ( 2 ) disk reflection component from neutral matter ( `` pexrav '' ; magdziarz @xmath0 zdziarski 1995 ) , ( 3 ) iron emission line , ( 4 ) two warm absorbers with different ionization states , and ( 5 ) neutral photoelectric absorption ( `` phabs '' ; balucinska - church @xmath0 mccammon 1992 ) .",
    "( 6 ) a narrow gaussian absorption line to account for the instrumental feature around the au m - edge .",
    "we use xstar version 2.1kn8 ( kallman et al .",
    "2004 ; see also the note in the end of the paper ) to model the warm absorbers , assuming the solar abundance and the photon index of the ionizing spectrum 2.0 .",
    "the temperature , pressure and density of the warm absorbers are assumed to be @xmath7 k , 0.03 dyne/@xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we made a grid model by running xstar for different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; the log @xmath10 values are from 0.1 to 5 ( erg cm s@xmath12 ) and @xmath11 values are from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the number of steps for log @xmath10 and @xmath11 are both 20 , thus our grid model has @xmath16 grid - points .",
    "all the fits were made with xspec v11 ( arnaud 1996 ) . in fig.@xmath17 , we show the fitting result for total average spectrum with a _ narrow _ emission line ( line width is fixed at @xmath18 ev ) , where reduced chisq is 1.51 ( @xmath19/d.o.f = 339.3/224 ) .",
    "the broadband 140 kev spectrum was fitted reasonably well , while there remain some residuals in the energy range of 57 kev ( within @xmath20 5 % ) for putatively broad iron emission line .",
    "note that the xstar warm absorber model includes the absorption lines , and in fact the observed fexxv and fexxvi absorption line features at 6.67 kev and 6.97 kev are successfully modeled .",
    "however , we found this spectral model fails to fit the data below 1 kev ; this issue is discussed separately in section [ below1kev ] .",

    "first , we make `` intensity - sliced energy spectra '' as follows :    \\1 ) create a light curve ( the average of xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) , with a bin - width of 128 sec in the 0.2  12 kev band . we found that the count rate varies from @xmath25 to @xmath26 cnts / sec .",

    "these intensity ranges are chosen so that the exposure times for individual intensity bins are approximately equal .",
    "\\3 ) from the eight intervals corresponding to the different source flux levels , we create eight intensity - sliced energy spectra ( the sum of xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) .",
    "second , to study spectral variations in various timescales , we extract `` bright spectra '' and `` faint spectra '' as follows :    \\1 ) divide the entire observation period into a series of the time - interval of which length is @xmath28 .",

    "thus , we have six `` bright spectra '' and six `` faint spectra '' corresponding to these timescales .",
    "note that there are data gaps within a single time interval , since suzaku has a low - earth orbit and the observation is intermittent every @xmath29 seconds or so .",
    "typical exposure is @xmath30 of the bin - size .",

    "in fact , figure [ data6 ] shows ratios of the bright spectra to the faint spectra for different time - intervals .",
    "it is obvious that the `` bright '' spectra are steeper than the `` dim '' spectra below @xmath3110 kev for all the time scales , and that the spectral difference becomes more significant with increasing timescales .",
    "we emphasize that the spectral variation we found here is _ model independent_.

    "namely , we found _ only two parameters are required _ to describe continuum spectral variations of the twelve data - sets , whereas all the other spectral parameters are constant ( iron line flux is slightly variable , which hardly affects the overall spectral shape ) .",

    "we found that we can fit all the twelve spectra with common photon index and the 0.706 kev edge optical depth , while only the power - law normalization and the optical depth of the 0.855 kev edge are variable ( fig .",

    "we found that optical depth of the o viii edge becomes deeper and shallower for the faint state and the bright state , respectively , as the variation timescale increases ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "@xmath34 ) .",
    "this result suggests that the ionization degree of the warm absorber is varying , since the oxygen is considered to be more highly ionized and the oviii edge depth becomes shallower , as the source brightens and the warm absorber gets more highly ionized .",

    "invariable ovii depth regardless of the flux variation , which was also observed with asca ( otani et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggests that the ovii edge originate from a rather extended area in the line of sight , so that the ovii edge depth does not respond to the flux variation instantaneously .",
    "the point here is that the spectral variation below 1.6 kev can be reproduced by sole variation of the photoionization as a natural consequence of the intrinsic flux changes , while the photon index is invariable .",

    "amplitude of the flux variation and the accompanying spectral change increases when the variation timescales become longer from 5 ksec to 200 ksec ( figure [ data345 ] ) .",

    "( 2007 ) advocates .",
    "difference is mainly due to the fact that we included warm absorbers , and used neutral refection without relativistic smearing .",
    "so that the constancy of the reflection component is explained by the light - bending model , all the disk reflection _ must _ take place within 3 @xmath43 , in which case the reflection normalization requires @xmath44 ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our result favors a smaller solid angle of the reflector .",
    "also , invariability of the neutral reflection component suggests that the reflection takes place far enough from the black hole , so that the intrinsic variation is smeared .",
