    "scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) measurements on highly correlated materials , such as the high temperature superconductors , are increasingly being analyzed @xcite in the hopes of inferring information concerning the character of the dominant interactions affecting the electron dynamics .",
    "however , it has long been known , as exemplified by a series of famous experiments  @xcite on simple metal surfaces , that the effects on the local density of states ( ldos ) of a change in the hamiltonian are highly _ non - local_. the interference patterns produced by quasiparticles scattering from an impurity cause ripples in the ldos to spread far and near .",
    "the possibility of such non - local effects make it a non - trivial issue how to best solve the inverse problem : given a set of high quality stm data , how does one work backwards to infer the character of the effective hamiltonian that produced the measured spectra ? in the present paper , we show that the low order moments of the ldos are determined entirely by the local form of the hamiltonian , and that they can therefore be simply analyzed to obtain an approximate solution to this inverse problem .    of particular interest to us are stm studies of the high temperature superconductor , ( bscco ) , which have revealed@xcite intriguing spatial inhomogeneities in the ldos , @xmath1 : for energies @xmath2 of order the superconducting gap , @xmath3 , there are order one variations in the ldos , although for @xmath4 , and again for @xmath5 there are only relatively small fractional variations in @xmath6 as a function of position , @xmath7 .",
    "the energy of the low energy peak in @xmath1 ( usually called the superconducting coherence peak ) varies substantially from one location to another , with a `` patch '' diameter of around 30@xmath8 .",
    "there have been at least two different interpretations of these results proposed : the first proposed interpretation  @xcite associates the local value of the peak in @xmath1 with the local magnitude of the gap parameter , @xmath9 , in a mean field hamiltonian . however , fang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that this interpretation can be quite misleading .",
    "they calculated the ldos of a metallic region ( with a local value of @xmath10 ) embedded in the background of a @xmath0-wave superconductor , with a bulk @xmath11 .",
    "unsurprisingly , they found that for a patch size comparable to the superconducting coherence length , the proximity effect causes the ldos in the metallic region to look like that of a uniform @xmath0-wave superconductor , with peaks at nonzero energy .",
    "( see also ref .  . )",
    "moments of the one particle spectral function can be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the hamiltonian and certain thermodynamic correlation functions , as has been recognized at least since the work of nolting _ et al . _",
    "nolting _ et al . _ and later authors , including oganesyan  @xcite , randeria _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and norman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed using a moment analysis to extract information from angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) data . while the moment analysis can be carried through at a fundamental level , _",
    "i.e. _ for schrodinger s equation , we are actually more interested in interpreting the results in terms of a low energy effective theory .",
    "we therefore begin by deriving expressions for the first and second moments of the ldos in the presence of disorder ( which was not considered by nolting _ et al _ ) , and for different assumptions concerning the structure of the effective hamiltonian .. ]    we define the moments of the ldos @xmath12 as @xmath13 ( note that an stm experiment does not actually measure the ldos due to the existence of unknown matrix elements .",
    "however , since we have normalized the moments as indicated , the effect of any energy independent matrix element cancels in @xmath14 . ) by definition , @xmath15 .",
    "expressions for the first and second moments in the two cases discussed here are derived in appendix a.    * case i : a quadratic ( mean - field ) effective hamiltonian : * in systems in which the relevant physics can be described in mean - field approximation , the low energy physics can be derived from an effective hamiltonian which is quadratic in the fermionic field operators ; this is the case in which the moment analysis is most powerful , as the moments depend only on the hamiltonian , and are independent of the associated thermodynamic correlations .",
    "needless to say , this approach neglects much of the strong correlation physics .",
    "we partially address this issue in case ii below .",
    "for now let us consider the most general mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath16 for which the moments are straightforwardly seen to be @xmath17 here the index @xmath7 labels the position and band index of a wannier function , as well as the spin - polarization , @xmath18 is the local value of the electro - chemical potential , @xmath19 is the hopping parameter from @xmath7 to @xmath20 , and @xmath9 is the superconducting gap parameter .",
    "* case ii : coupling to fluctuating fields : * in case i , we assumed that @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 were simply numbers .",
    "however , these parameters could have dramatically fluctuating pieces , which are either present due to phonon mediated deformations of the effective electronic hamiltonian or are generated ( via a hubbard - stratanovich transformation ) from an underlying interacting hamiltonian .",
    "as discussed at the end of appendix a , all the expressions in eq .   and",
    "are generalized in this case by replacing the left - hand side of each expression by its thermal expectation value ( signified by @xmath24 ) , so in eq .  , @xmath25 and in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , a fluctuating superconducting gap parameter with rms value @xmath28 ( above @xmath29 ) makes the same contribution to the second moment as a mean - field gap of magnitude @xmath28 ( in the superconducting state ) .",
    "henceforth , we will focus on case i , with the understanding that the effective parameters that enter the hamiltonian may inherit temperature and magnetic field dependences from the underlying thermodynamic state of the system .",
    "the integrals which define the moments , @xmath30 extend to infinite energies . not only does this make them unmeasurable quantities , even if we could measure them",
    ", we would not expect them to yield useful information .",
    "an effective hamiltonian provides a reasonable description of the complex microscopic problem , at best , over a finite range of `` low '' energies .",
    "given this , we need to consider the more complex issue of what information can be gleaned from the partial moments , in which the integrals are cutoff at a finite energy @xmath31 : @xmath32 note that @xmath33 .",
    "there is no simple general expression for the partial moments .",
    "however , there are circumstances in which important information can be obtained from them , anyway . in this sense ,",
    "the application of these ideas is analogous to the application of the @xmath34-sum rule to the analysis of optical conductivity data .",
    "for instance , were we interested in the temperature ( @xmath35 ) or the magnetic field ( @xmath36 ) dependence of the effective hamiltonian , we might look at the difference between the ldos at @xmath37 and @xmath38 and its value at non - zero @xmath35 or @xmath36 ; if , as is often the case , @xmath1 is essentially @xmath35 and @xmath36 independent above a characteristic energy , @xmath31 , then by analyzing the partial moments @xmath39 , we can obtain information about the induced _ changes _ in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "for the present purposes , we will focus on a different example , relevant to the analysis of the above mentioned stm data in bscco .",
    "suppose we are interested in obtaining information about the spatial variations of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "again , assuming that for a range of energies @xmath40 , @xmath1 is approximately @xmath7 independent , we can analyze the spatially varying part of the moments , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average of @xmath39 for all @xmath7 , in terms of the spatially varying pieces of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "an added advantage of this approach , as we shall shortly see , is that different terms in the effective hamiltonian produce changes in the moments on different energy scales .    *",
    "an explicit model : * to illustrate the various aspects of this approach , we will consider a specific model problem , which we design with the stm studies of bscco in mind .",
    "we suppose that the electronic structure is governed by a 2d effective hamiltonian , @xmath43 on a square lattice of the form given in eq .  , with parameters taken to be representative@xcite of the band structure and pairing symmetry of bscco .",
    "we consider the case in which there is an inhomogeneous `` patch '' of size @xmath44 embedded in an otherwise uniform infinite background .",
    "( while this choice of patch size is arbitrary , we were motivated by the experimental observation in bscco @xcite of apparent patches of size around 3 nm . ) for the spatially uniform piece of @xmath43 we define @xmath45 for @xmath7 and @xmath20 nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "( the band structure retains up to fifth nearest neighbor terms , with second nearest neighbor @xmath46 , and other hopping matrix elements smaller in magnitude by a factor of five or more . )",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath7 and @xmath20 nearest - neighbor sites with the signs chosen consistent with the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "we further take a representative value of @xmath49 .",
    "( in the case of bscco , @xmath50 ev and @xmath51ev . ) the band , which is not particle hole - symmetric , runs from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "inside the patch we will consider three different extreme cases : ( 1 ) inhomogeneous electro - chemical potential : @xmath54 for @xmath7 inside the patch , ( 2 ) inhomogeneous gap parameter with the @xmath55wave symmetry : @xmath56 for nearest neighbor @xmath57 inside the patch .",
    "3 ) inhomogeneous band structure : @xmath58 for nearest neighbor @xmath57 inside the patch .     due to",
    "the suppression of @xmath21 in a @xmath59 patch ( displayed region is 14 sites wide ) for several choices of @xmath31 .",
    "( the band runs from @xmath60 to @xmath53 . ) as we expect , when the cutoff is large , the second moment only knows about the local environment , and its value changes abruptly as @xmath7 crosses into the region of suppressed gap .",

    "we have evaluated these expressions numerically to compute the ldos .",
    "these are in turn integrated numerically to compute the partial moments .",
    "* locality of the partial moments : * fig .",
    "[ locality ] shows the response of @xmath63 to the inhomogeneity in the gap parameter for several choices of @xmath31 . in the present case ,",
    "we have taken @xmath64 , that is we have considered the case in which the pairing potential is absent inside the patch . for presentational clarity ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath65 , the renormalized difference between @xmath66 and the average value @xmath67 , which in this case is identical to the asymptotic value @xmath68 ) .",
    "hence @xmath69 approaches 0 when the position @xmath7 is far from the patch .",
    "both the ldos at fixed @xmath2 ( not shown ) and @xmath70 for @xmath71 exhibit complicated @xmath7 dependences , with induced spatial variability that extends far outside the patch .",
    "however , once @xmath72 is greater than a few times @xmath3 , even though @xmath31 is still substantially less than the bandwidth , @xmath61 approaches its asymptotic value rapidly .    from eq .",
    "it follows that , in the limit @xmath73 , @xmath74 . for non - infinite @xmath31",
    ", we can see that the partial moment is already approximately equal to the @xmath73 moment when @xmath75 ( _ i.e. _ , half the bandwidth ) and it overestimates the response of the moment by @xmath76 40% for @xmath77 ( _ i.e. _ , 1/5 of the bandwidth . )",
    "thus , qualitatively accurate information about the structure of the effective hamiltonian can be obtained even if the range of integration is restricted to as little as 1/5 of the bandwidth . specifically ,",
    "if one were to simply pretend that @xmath78 is approximately equal to @xmath79 , one would conclude that the gap parameter changes from its value inside the patch to its value outside the patch over an interface region of width equal to a couple of lattice constants ( as opposed to the actual one lattice constant ) and one would underestimate the magnitude of the variation of the gap parameter by 40% .",

    "the curves have all been normalized , as indicated , to be appropriate dimensionless measures of the variation .",
    "since the spectrum is bounded above , the moments achieve their asymptotic values once @xmath31 is in excess of the band edge , @xmath84 .",
    "the various kinks in the curves reflect the lower band edge .    in fig .",
    "[ omega1dependence ] we see that in the case of an inhomogeneous @xmath85 , the first moment has already reached 40% of its asymptotic value by the time @xmath31 is 1/20 of the bandwidth .",
    "the effect of the inhomogeneities in @xmath21 and @xmath23 goes to zero for @xmath31 in excess of the bandwidth as we expect from eq .. this happens very rapidly for the case of gap inhomogeneities , so even when @xmath31 is moderately small compared to the bandwidth , the first moment gives a reasonable measure of the inhomogeneity of the band structure parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    the most striking feature of fig .  [ omega2dependence ]",
    "is that for small @xmath31 , @xmath69 , becomes rapidly large ( even larger than its asymptotic value ) in the case of an inhomogeneous @xmath21 , but remains relatively small in the other two cases until @xmath31 is a substantial fraction of the bandwidth .",
    "( this is especially true for inhomogeneous @xmath22 . )",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath86 for @xmath31 a few times @xmath87 but still much less than the bandwidth gives a reasonable measure of the spatial variations of @xmath21 .",
