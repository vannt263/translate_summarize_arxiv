    "strongly - correlated one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi-1d systems can be simulated accurately using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , which is a set of algorithms operating on matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "real systems can usually not be isolated completely from their environment and experiments are hence necessarily done at finite ( nonzero ) temperatures . to allow for a direct investigation of experimental results or for theoretical investigations on the influence of temperature ,",
    "dmrg techniques have been generalized to describe thermal states .",
    "the historically first dmrg algorithm for finite temperatures is the quantum transfer - matrix renormalization group @xcite , which is however complicated by the non - hermiticity of the quantum transfer matrix and does not allow for a direct evaluation of non - local observables .",
    "a recent approach combines time - dependent dmrg @xcite with monte carlo to evaluate thermal observables by sampling over so - called minimally entangled typical thermal states @xcite and is also applicable for the study response functions @xcite .",
    "the arguably most successful method , which is at the focus of this paper , is based on a purification of the density matrix @xcite , i.e. , the representation through a pure state in an enlarged hilbert space . is called a purification of the density matrix @xmath2 on @xmath3 if @xmath4 . ] for numerical purposes , these are approximated very precisely in matrix product form , to obtain so - called matrix product purifications ( mpp ) @xcite .",
    "first applications to static phenomena @xcite showed the potential of the approach which is also known as the ancilla method .",
    "it has been extended for the computation of response functions @xcite and allows it also to work directly in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "the various applications comprise , for example , the phase diagrams of spin - ladder systems @xcite , thermometry for ultracold bosons in optical lattices @xcite , the drude weight in spin-@xmath0 and hubbard chains @xcite , as well as spectral properties of quantum magnets @xcite , bosonic systems @xcite , and spin - incoherent luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to compute an mpp of a grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we consider lattice systems ( 1d or quasi-1d ) , such that the hilbert space has tensor - product structure .",
    "the grand - canonical infinite - temperature state is then a tensor product of on - site identities and the corresponding mpp has bond dimension one .",
    "a subsequent imaginary - time evolution yields the mpp of the grand - canonical ensemble at finite temperatures .",
    "when a system features symmetries , these can be exploited to reduce computation costs substantially . for a conserved quantity @xmath5 , one can use that the imaginary - time evolution does not mix components with different @xmath5 quantum numbers .",
    "however , the grand - canonical ensemble contains of course contributions from all quantum number sectors such that the benefit of symmetries is reduced .",
    "this paper introduces and demonstrates efficient methods to compute mpps of canonical ensembles under utilization of symmetries .",
    "in particular , we give exact matrix product representations for canonical infinite - temperature states ( sect .  [",
    "sec : ce_beta0_exact ] ) , and discuss how they can be constructed alternatively by applying matrix product operators to vacuum - type states ( sect .",

    "[ sec : example ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , let us restrict our considerations to an abelian symmetry with a single conserved quantity @xmath7 such as the total number of particles or magnetization",
    ". however , everything generalizes in a very similar manner to the cases with multiple conserved quantities and non - abelian symmetries @xcite . for the latter one exploits that dependencies inside each multiplet are given by clebsh - gordan coefficients as exemplified by the wigner - eckart theorem .",

    "this is in agreement with the traditional interpretation of the mps tensors @xmath28 in the dmrg @xcite . from that point of view ,",
    "the tensors take the role of projectors from a reduced hilbert space of dimension @xmath29 with basis @xmath30 for the block of sites @xmath31 $ ] to another reduced @xmath16-dimensional hilbert space with basis @xmath32 for the same block , such that @xmath33_{a_i , b_i}|a_i{\\rangle}\\otimes|n_i{\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "the constraint then means that mixing of quantum numbers is prohibited in these projections .    for systems with multiple conserved quantities ,",
    "@xmath34 , the only difference to the above is that quantum number labels become vectors such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the explicit implementation of symmetries can reduce computation costs considerably .",
    "typical costly operations for matrix product states , e.g. , in a time - evolution or ground - state calculation , are singular value decompositions of the @xmath38-tensors like @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are isometric according to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values .",
    "the cost of such a singular value decomposition scales as @xmath45 with the onsite hilbert space dimension @xmath46 and the bond dimension @xmath47 .",
    "now , with the implementation of symmetries according to the quantum number constraint , the @xmath38-tensors assume a block structure with nonzero blocks corresponding to groups of states obeying eq .  .",
    "a singular value decomposition can then be done block by block .",
    "often , the total computation cost is then dominated by the biggest block , the dimensions of which can be much smaller than the total bond dimensions @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath53 if system and bath also interchange the quantity associated with @xmath7 . here , @xmath54 is the associated lagrange multiplier that fixes the expectation value of @xmath7 .",
    "two examples are that @xmath7 is the total magnetization @xmath55 and @xmath56 the magnetic field or that @xmath7 is the total particle number @xmath57 and @xmath56 the chemical potential .    in more complex cases with multiple conserved quantities",
    "@xmath58 , one can also consider ensembles like @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 is fixed to @xmath61 and the expectation value @xmath62 is fixed by the lagrange multiplier @xmath63 .",

    "the total number of electrons @xmath68 could be fixed , but , for example due to a transverse magnetic field , only the expectation value of the magnetization @xmath69 might be fixed by a magnetic field in @xmath70-direction . in passing",
