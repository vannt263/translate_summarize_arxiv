    "this , together with an extremely low interaction rate of less than 10 events per kilogram of absorber material and year of exposure requires very sensitive detectors , which allow the rejection of background events  @xcite .    in order to reject the background radiation , cresst - ii uses scintillating crystals as target material",

    "the energy deposited in a scintillating absorber crystal by a particle interaction excites both phonons and scintillation light .",
    "the relative amount of light depends on the nature of the detected particle . as wimps , in comparison to highly ionizing particles ,",
    "cause a relatively low light output , the optimization of detection of the scintillation light is of utmost importance .",
    "the scintillation light is absorbed by a silicon coated sapphire crystal , exciting phonons in the crystal lattice .",
    "each of the two crystals of a detector module , cawo@xmath0 and sapphire , is connected to a superconducting phase transition thermometer for measurement of the phonon signals .",
    "such a thermometer consists of a thin film of superconducting material ( tungsten ) which is deposited on the crystal .",
    "phonons are absorbed in the film and increase the temperature of its electron system .",
    "the film is thermally stabilized in its phase transition from the superconducting to normal conducting state , therefore its resistance is extremely sensitive to variations in temperature .",
    "phonons that are absorbed in the film increase the temperature of its electron system and thus its resistance .",
    "the change in resistance is read out by a sensitive squid circuit  @xcite .",
    "the upcoming eureca experiment is going to use particle detection and discrimination techniques developed and studied in the cresst - ii experiment  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the use of glued detectors is to produce the superconducting phase transition thermometers on small substrates that later on are glued onto the scintillating absorber crystals .",
    "this has several advantages :    light yield : : :    for the evaporation of a tungsten film , the scintillating absorber    crystal is heated up .",
    "heat , however , degrades the light output of the    scintillator  @xcite , resulting in a decreased particle discrimination    capability .",

    ", the gluing technique already allowed    the use of a znwo@xmath0 scintillating absorber crystal in    the current run  @xcite .",
    "mass production : : :    producing several thermometers at once on a single substrate increases    the overall speed of detector production .",
    "the substrate can be cut and    the thermometers then can be glued onto several absorber crystals . for    the upcoming experiment which aims at increasing the target mass ,",
    "many    more detector modules are needed than the 33 foreseen for cresst - ii .      for the investigation of glued detectors ,",
    "a proof - of - principle experiment was performed .",
    "this experiment was not shielded from background radiation . in order to cope with the relatively high count rates ,",
    "a setup smaller than the one used at gran sasso was chosen : instead of a cylindrical crystal of @xmath3{mm}$ ] height and @xmath3{mm}$ ] diameter , a cuboid of @xmath4{mm^{3}}$ ] , named c14 was used ( see fig . [",
    "fig : c14setup ] ) .    the experiment consisted of two parts : first",

    "a theoretical model  @xcite of the behaviour of a one - crystal - setup with a superconducting phase transition thermometer was extended in order to describe the more complex case of a glued detector .",
    "the detection of phonons works by the following principle : absorption of radiation in the scintillating absorber crystal creates high - frequency phonons that do not thermalize on the millisecond time scale .",
    "the phonons travel through the crystal ballistically before being collected in the thermometer . there",
    ", the phonon energy is transferred into the electron system of the superconducting phase transition thermometer , changing its electrical resistance by a measurable amount .",

    "@xmath18 the phonons enter the thermometer from the absorber crystal and leave through the thermal link .",
    "this raises the temperature of the thermometer by an amount of @xmath19 above its equilibrium temperature : @xmath20 by solving these two differential equations with the initial conditions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 one obtains a pulse consisting of two exponentials describing the temperature of the thermometer : @xmath23 the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 are considered as the decay time @xmath26 and the rise time @xmath27 of the pulse , respectively .",

    "this is due to a calibration effect : particles of the same energy create lower pulse heights if being absorbed in the glued - on absorber than if being absorbed in the thermometer carrier . therefore a certain energy band can not be measured via the glued - on absorber while measurement with the thermometer carrier is still possible .",
