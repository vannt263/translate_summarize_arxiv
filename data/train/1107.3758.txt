    "the galactic ob - associations offer a unique opportunity to study the influence of massive stars on the interstellar matter",
    ". a reconstruction of the star - formation history of many galactic fields should be possible once the spatial distribution of the young stars is reliably determined . despite the extensive efforts to improve and unify the distances to the young stellar groups in the milky way ( mw ) , discrepancies still remain in the published studies for a large number of fields .",
    "many of the present distance estimates are based to a large extent on preliminary distance calibrations , broad - band photometry , or absolute magnitudes ( @xmath3 ) obtained via spectral and luminosity type ( mk classification ) . on the other hand ,",

    "are based mainly on individual stellar distances and rarely on main - sequence fitting , applying @xmath0 photometry should lead to a significant improvement for many ob groups in the mw .",
    "our deriving of @xmath0 photometric distances utilizes the intrinsic colour calibrations of crawford @xcite and kilkenny & whittet @xcite and the luminosity calibration of balona & shobbrook @xcite and takes into account possible stellar emission and mis - classification @xcite .",
    "the expected errors for one star are about 12 % for luminosity classes iii - iv and about 18 - 20  % for luminosity classes i and ii .",
    "photometric @xmath0 distances derived in this way provide the same impression of the star - forming field s structure as the improved @xmath4 parallaxes ( cf .",

    "we present improved distance estimates for four galactic ob associations .",
    "lac ob1 ( lac  ob1b , @xcite ) is a nearby notable clustering of early - type stars near 10 lacertae that initially gained attention because of the expanding motion of its members .",
    "based on the derived @xmath0 photometric distances used in conjunction with the photometric diagrams we identify lac ob1 as a compact group of 12 low - reddened main - sequence stars located at a distance 520@xmath1 pc in the direction @xmath5 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the available radial velocity and proper motion measurements support the impression that this is a real group . for these 12 stars ,",
    "the recalculated @xmath4 parallaxes @xcite are in excellent agreement with the photometric @xmath0 parallaxes .",
    "the photometric distance of the o9v star 10  lac ( hd 214680 ) is estimated to be 715@xmath6 pc .",
    "although this estimate is considerably larger than the one based on @xmath4 , the agreement for this stars is better with the recomputed @xmath4 parallax @xcite which yields a distance of @xmath7 pc in comparison to the original @xmath4 estimate of @xmath8 pc .",

    "lodn 112 is identified as a poor , but compact cluster candidate .",
    "based on @xmath0 photometry we obtained true dm = 11.06@xmath120.12(s.e . ) and average color excess @xmath13 = 0.5@xmath120.03(s.e . )",
    "this corresponds to a distance of 1630@xmath1282 pc , which is significantly smaller than the presently adopted 2500 pc ( webda ) . in our @xmath0 sample there are several other early b stars located at that exact distance .",
    "the photometric distances and available proper motions allowed us to identify a group of about 10 early b stars that could represent a new ob association at coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 which appears to be connected to lodn 112 cluster candidate ( see a poster by kaltcheva & golev at this meeting for more details ) .",

    "another apparent concentration ( small black plus - symbols , six stars ) is found at @xmath25 , @xmath26 and an average distance of 3308@xmath27 pc .",
    "the significant spread in distance suggests that these are not physical groups .",
    "the third apparent grouping , marked with black dots ( 16 stars ) , is found at @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( this is car  1b of @xcite ) .",
    "these stars are well grouped at 2583@xmath30(s.e . )",
    "pc ( see @xcite for more details ) .",

    "the classical mon ob2 association , previously thought to be at 1.6 kpc , is represented by a relatively compact group at 1.26 kpc in the vicinity of ngc  2244 and a layer of massive stars between 1.5 and 3 kpc spread across the entire field .",

    "as already mentioned , a better understanding of the phenomena associated with the interaction between young massive stars and their surrounding ism in the fields of the galactic ob associations should be possible once their structure is reliably established . a multi - wavelength approach analyzing the distribution of the massive ob stars , ionized and neutral material , and that of the interstellar dust would allow us to better understand the different components of the ism and the interactions among them .",
