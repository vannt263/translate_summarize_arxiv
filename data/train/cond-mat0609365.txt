    "density functional theory ( dft ) has made it possible to calculate ground state properties of even very large systems efficiently and accurately . as the exact",
    "functional is unknown , practical applications of dft require an approximate exchange correlation energy , @xmath0$].@xcite of these , the local spin density approximation ( lda)@xcite has been successful despite its simplicity . the generalized gradient approximations ( ggas ) are an attempt to improve on the lda .",
    "it is possible to construct a gga free of empirical parameters , known as the perdew burke ernzerhof ( pbe)-gga , by demanding that the gga obeys certain fundamental constraints.@xcite numerical tests have shown that the pbe - gga gives total energy dependent properties in good agreement with experiment.@xcite consequently , the pbe - gga functional has been extremely influential , both for performing actual calculations and as a basis for functionals involving higher derivatives and exact exchange.@xcite    as both the density and the gradient can only be constant in the homogeneous electron gas limit , there can be no unique gga@xcite and the constraints of the pbe - gga are not sufficient to uniquely define the functional .",
    "the pbe functional form was based on a numerical gga@xcite where a model of the exchange correlation hole was constructed to satisfy known exact hole constraints .",
    "the constraints were satisfied using a sharp real space cutoff and a damping function , which were choices of the authors and different choices would lead to different functionals.@xcite this was recently demonstrated by wu and cohen ( wc),@xcite who used the gradient expansion for slowly varying densities@xcite to construct a gga with a functional form corresponding to a diffuse cutoff.@xcite the wc - gga damps the gradient enhancement , which results in improved equilibrium volumes for densely packed solids , but poorer exchange energies of atoms compared to the pbe.@xcite another modification of the pbe , the rpbe@xcite , chooses a functional form with a larger gradient enhancement , which generally leads to very good atomic exchange energies but poor equilibrium volumes of solids.@xcite the pbe , rpbe and wc functionals differ only in the functional form of the exchange energy enhancement and all satisfy the same conditions as the pbe .",
    "a different approach to has been to construct ggas as parameterized fits ( see kurth et al.@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "these semiempirical functionals are often precise for a certain set of compounds , but the parameters are rarely physically transparent and it is consequently not clear when they could fail . furthermore they generally violate the known exact conditions satisfied by the pbe - gga .",
    "this paper introduces a new functional form that brings the wc , pbe and rpbe exchange functionals onto a common ground and allows semiempirical functionals , that do not violate the constraints of the pbe - gga , to be constructed .",
    "the shape of the functional is controlled by one physically transparent parameter and in the construction of the functional it is ensured that the exact conditions of pbe are not violated .",
    "the ggas write the exchange energy density pr .",
    "particle as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lda exchange energy density pr .",
    "@xmath3 is the enhancement factor due to density gradients and is dependent on the reduced density gradient , @xmath4 .",
    "the pbe enhancement factor is given as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fxpbe ] ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are determined to ensure that the exchange gradient correction cancels that for pbe correlation as @xmath10 and to ensure that the local lieb - oxford bound is obeyed.@xcite the rpbe functional differs in the functional form f^rpbe_x(x)=1+(1-e^-x/ ) while the wc functional retains the functional form of pbe but introduces a complicated @xmath11.@xcite the enhancement factors of wc , pbe and rpbe are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : funcform ] .",
    "obviously the wc , pbe and prbe functionals satisfy the local lieb - oxford bound . by taylor expanding @xmath12 for @xmath13",
    "it is clear that all three exchange functionals have the correct first order expansion , @xmath14 , and thus obey the cancellation condition : @xmath15    the exchange enhancement , which will be named pbe@xmath16 , that will be presented here has the form @xmath17 where @xmath16 is a parameter .",
    "the taylor expansion @xmath18 shows that pbe@xmath16 satisfies the cancellation condition for all @xmath16 .",
    "the pbe and rpbe are then special cases of pbe@xmath19 and pbe@xmath20 respectively .",
    "the pbe@xmath16 functional is shown for two different @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig : funcform ] where it is seen how the size of the gradient enhancement can be controlled through the @xmath16 parameter .",
    "other attempts have been made at systematically varying the pbe functional form either by making an expansion of the enhancement coefficients@xcite or by varying the @xmath21 parameter.@xcite however , these functionals either violate the local lieb - oxford bound or can only ensure it through a fitting constraint .",
    "in the following , the influence of the parameter @xmath16 will be discussed .",
    "all calculation have been performed using the wien2k code.@xcite the basis sets and @xmath22-meshes have been converged and equations of states ( eoss ) have been found by fitting the stabilized jellium eos@xcite to the calculated total energies .",
    "the influence of the parameter @xmath16 can be illustrated by comparing the body centered cubic ( bcc ) phase of fe with the hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) .",
    "the example is well studied and it is known that lda wrongly predicts the non - magnetic fcc phase to be stable at zero pressure.@xcite eos parameters have been calculated for bcc and hcp iron using lda and pbe@xmath16 for three choices of @xmath16 , table  [ tab : feeos ] . using the eos parameters , bcc - hcp phase transition pressures of 14.0 , 16.4 and 18.3 gpa",
    "are predicted for pbe@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , in reasonable agreement with a recent experimental study which fixed the transition pressure between 14 and 16 gpa.@xcite    the iron example shows how the @xmath16 parameter can be interpreted .",
    "a small @xmath16 favors the close packed structure ( in the extreme case of the lda the hcp structure is predicted to be stable at ambient pressure ) while a large @xmath16 favors an open structure .",
    "this also illustrates the dangers of the most obvious use of the pbe@xmath16 functional : fitting @xmath16 for a certain problem . if one uses data set of densely packed structures and a small @xmath16 , one risks biasing the results towards the densely packed structures . if one uses a data set of open structures ( or in the extreme : atoms ) and",
    "obtain a large @xmath16 one risks biasing the results towards the open structures .",
    "often it is probably better to use the well tested pbe@xmath24 functional .",
    "however , varying @xmath16 will provide information on how sensitive the results obtained are too variations of the functional .",
    "such a philosophy was also recently proposed in a statistical study of the exchange enhancement.@xcite the pbe@xmath16 functional would probably better suited for this approach than the form actually used,@xcite which was similar to the mpbe.@xcite    .equation of state parameters for bcc and hcp iron . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          though often ignored in the construction of a functional , the resulting exchange - correlation potential is an important quantity in judging the quality of a functional.@xcite according to perdew and wang,@xcite the exchange potential of a gga can be calculated as v_x==_x [ eq : xcpotential1 ] where @xmath26 .",
    "the potential thus depends on both the first and second derivative of the enhancement form .",
    "one advantage of the pbe@xmath16 form compared to earlier attempts to vary the exchange enhancement is that its simpler form leads a smoother exchange potential .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : partder ] where the terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 from the pbe@xmath19 , the wc and the mpbe @xmath12 are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the wc terms , due to the complicated form of @xmath29 , have an oscillating behavior while the mpbe converges very slowly to zero .",
    "the slow convergence of the mpbe is particularly unpleasant as this term is multiplied by the @xmath30 , which diverges for large @xmath31 .",
    "though ggas in general do not have the correct @xmath32 asymptotic decay , the mpbe does not correct this problem , and the effects is an artifact of a poorly constructed functional form .",
    "a new functional form for ggas has been proposed , which can be systematically varied by the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "one could thereby obtain a functional that combines the virtues of semi - empirical ggas , high precision for a specific set of compounds , with the virtues of pbe , obeying the same exact constraints as the pbe . compared to other semi - empirical functionals",
    "it is an advantage that only one parameter is used and that the @xmath16 has clear interpretation , which can be used to check whether results are biased towards densely packed or open systems . one further advantage of the pbe@xmath16 is that the simple construction of the functional form leads to a smooth exchange potential .",
    "it is clear , that the limited amount of information in the gradient of the density makes it impossible to make a gga functional that works equally well for all cases . on higher rungs of the dft ladder,@xcite such as the meta - ggas , this could be possible .",
    "one way to include the extra information is make the @xmath33 dependent on more variables , as in the recently proposed tpss meta - gga.@xcite a different route could be to make @xmath16 be determined by the density and not be the same every where in space .",
    "one could e.g. use that for an exponentially decreasing density @xmath34 to identify regions where @xmath16 should be large .",
    "an other idea which does not involve higher derivatives was put forward by wu and cohen,@xcite who suggested making the exchange enhancement dependent directly on the density ( @xmath35 ) .",
