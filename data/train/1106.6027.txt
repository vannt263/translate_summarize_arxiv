    "the recent cosmic ray observations by pamela@xcite , atic@xcite and fermi@xcite have all reported an excess of positrons and electrons from @xmath6 gev up to @xmath7 tev .",
    "these anomalies have stimulated a lot of interests , especially these excesses may be attributed to the signals of dark matter annihilation in the galaxy . if these extra positrons / electrons are indeed from dm annihilation , it requires definite properties of dm .",
    "for example , dm should annihilate into lepton final states dominantly and should have a much larger annihilation cross section ( @xmath8@xmath9s@xmath10 ) than the natural value ( @xmath11@xmath9s@xmath10 ) at freeze out @xcite .",
    "the annihilation cross section at freeze out determines the dm relic density if dm is generated thermally at the early universe .    in general , the dm annihilation cross section @xmath12 depends on the averaged velocity of dm .",
    "for example , in the usual weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) scenario , @xmath13 can be expanded to a form of @xmath14 at the non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "if the annihilation process is s - wave dominant , @xmath13 is a constant . for the p - wave annihilation",
    ", @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the dm annihilation by p - wave is suppressed today than the decoupling time since the wimp usually has a velocity of @xmath16 at the freeze - out epoch and cools when universe expands .",
    "the dm velocity near the solar system is @xmath17 , much smaller than that at the decoupling epoch .",
    "however , as indicated by the pamela , atic and fermi data , we actually ask for a much larger annihilation cross section today to account for the excesses than that at the early universe .",
    "contrary to the analysis before for the p - wave annihilation we require an annihilation form @xmath13 depends on @xmath18 .",
    "this form leads to a large annihilation cross section today with low dm velocity and explains the cosmic positron anomaly and relic density simultaneously .",
    "some mechanisms are soon proposed to achieve this aim after these results published , such as the sommerfeld enhancement @xcite and the breit - wigner enhancement @xcite .    for the sommerfeld enhancement , a new light mediator with mass of o(gev )",
    "is introduced , and provide an enhancement factor of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is coupling constant between dm and mediator ) . for the breit - wigner enhancement , the dm annihilates via a narrow resonance , and an enhance factor of @xmath21^{-1}/o(10)$ ] can be obtained @xcite ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 are defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , where m is the mass of dm , m and @xmath26 are the mass and decay width of the resonance respectively ) .",
    "one can achieve correct enhancement factor @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the temperature of chemical decoupling ) by adjusting the parameters appropriately .",
    "it seems that the enhancement should not be important in the early universe when the velocity of dm is @xmath29 , and the enhancement factor is only @xmath30 .",
    "however , some recent studies showed that such effects are not negligible even at the freeze - out epoch @xcite , especially for the sommerfeld enhancement . the ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it may be difficult to achieve the required enhancement factor in the minimal sommerfeld models considering the effect at the early universe .    in this work",
    ", we will give a careful inspection on the breit - wigner mechanism at the dm freeze - out process .",
    "for the breit - wigner mechanism , the dm annihilation continues after the chemical decoupling until the dm velocity drops below the cut - off scale .",
    "therefore the relic density is determined by the cut - off scale related to @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite . in the work we will show another important factor in determining the relic density , _ i.e. _ the kinetic decoupling process @xcite .    after the chemical decoupling at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 represents the temperature of the universe which is defined as @xmath33 ) , the dm particle is still kept in kinetic equilibrium via the scattering with the hot bath .",
    "when such scattering is not efficient to keep dm in kinetic equilibrium , the dm momentum is red - shifted with the scale factor @xmath34 , which leads to a rapid decrease of dm temperature as @xmath35 rather than @xmath36 at the kinetic equilibrium epoch @xcite . therefore , after the kinetic decoupling @xmath13 increases quickly and then reduces the abundances of dm more efficiently . taking this effect into account we find the breit - wigner mechanism is hard to provide a self - consistent explanation for both the dm relic density and the positron anomaly today .",
