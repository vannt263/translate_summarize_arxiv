    "cassiopeia a ( cas a ) is the youngest galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) known and , with the exception of the sun , ranks as the strongest discrete radio source in the sky at @xmath20 mhz . at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "cas  a consists of a @xmath16 2@xmath21 radius broken shell of sn debris rich in o , s , si , ar , ca expanding at 4000  6000 km s@xmath17 . within this shell",
    "lie about two dozen knots of much slower moving , n - rich clumps of pre - sn , circumstellar mass loss material .",
    "outside of the shell , faint radio and x - ray emission extends to a radial distance of @xmath16 160@xmath22 where a faint , filamentary edge of x - ray emission marks the current location of the remnant s forward shock front . at an estimated distance of 3.4@xmath23 kpc @xcite",
    ", these angular dimensions correspond to main shell and outer shock front radii of 2 pc and 2.7 pc respectively .",
    "several dozen faint optical knots with velocities of 8000 to 15,000 km s@xmath17 have been detected outside some sections of the main shell , mainly in a northeastern `` jet '' of high speed ejecta @xcite .    the remnant s precise age is uncertain . from proper motion studies for @xmath24 100 of cas  a s optical knots during 1951  1980 , (",
    "* hereafter kvdb76 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vdbk83 ) determined an explosion date of 1658 @xmath25 for the remnant as a whole ( assuming no deceleration ) and a somewhat later date of 1671 for a few higher - velocity northeastern `` jet '' knots .",
    "the difference between these derived dates probably reflects a greater deceleration of bright main shell knots caused by their interaction with the remnant s reverse shock .",
    "there are no unambiguous historical observations of a bright nova or variable star in cassiopeia that might be associated with a late 17-th century supernova .",
    "however , on 1680 august 16 john flamsteed , the first astronomer royal , reported seeing a 5th  6th magnitude star he designated `` supra @xmath26 '' and later renamed 3 cassiopeiae in his 1725 _ historia coelestia _ star catalog @xcite .",
    "its proximity to cas a , together with the fact that he never observed this star again , raises the possibility that he sighted the cas a supernova in the summer of 1680 .",
    "the positional differences between cas a and the 3 cas position are , however , troublingly large .",
    "flamsteed s location for 3 cas is offset from cas a by @xmath27 in right ascension and @xmath28 in declination .",
    "although refraction and sextant corrections might decrease these residuals to @xmath16 6@xmath21 in both coordinates ( errors not unprecedented for flamsteed ) , the case for flamsteed s sighting of cas a is controversial @xcite .    without additional evidence ,",
    "the significance of flamsteed s observation might well remain inconclusive .",
    "however , the large proper motions of the remnant s ejecta knots ( @xmath29 = @xmath30 yr@xmath17 ) can be used to set limits on cas  a s age and thereby test the possible 1680 explosion date .",
    "an accurate measurement of cas a s age would in turn provide key information about deceleration of its high - speed knots and thus the phase of its evolutionary development .",
    "accurate proper motion measurements can also be used to improve determinations of the the remnant s center of expansion .",
    "kvdb76 determined the remnant s expansion center to within an error radius of about one arcsecond .",
    "no optical point source or extended emission is present at this location down to i @xmath24 24 mag @xcite .",
    "knowledge of cas a s precise expansion center has recently gained greater interest with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ discovery of an x - ray point source near the remnant s",
    "center @xcite . this object , which could be either a neutron star with magnetized polar caps or an accreting compact object @xcite , lies significantly offset from estimates for the remnant s center of expansion ( coe ) .",
    "point source coordinates derived from _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ data show a separation of @xmath31 from the kvdb76 and vdbk83 coe , and some @xmath32 from the coe inferred by @xcite using knot radial velocities .",
    "these offsets imply transverse velocities of @xmath33 km s@xmath17 and @xmath34 km s@xmath17 respectively , assuming d = 3.4 kpc and an age of 320 yr @xcite .    in this paper , we present proper motions of 17 outlying high - velocity ejecta knots discovered over the last decade [ see @xcite and references therein ] along with 21 selected main shell knots .",
    "many of these 40 knots can be seen on the earliest archival palomar 5  m pf plates , giving proper motion baselines of nearly five decades , or about 1/7th of the remnant s age .",
    "we use these proper motions to determine a more accurate position and date for the supernova .",
    "our observational material includes palomar 5  m prime focus ( pf ) plates dating back to 1951 , ccd images taken @xmath1 with the kpno 4  m and mdm 2.4  m telescopes , and a few 1999 _ hst _ wfpc2 images . table 1 lists information on the images that were used .",
    "although archival plates and modern ccd image data have , in many cases , substantially different spectral sensitivities , the angular scale of knot emission stratification or ionization structures lies well below all but the highest resolution _ hst _ data @xcite and thus does not pose a significant problem for the inter - comparison of knot positions from these different data sets .    to maximize the time base , we examined several dozen archival palomar 5  m pf plates beginning with r. minkowski in 1951 and ending with s. van den bergh in 1989 .",
    "most of these plates were unsuitable for this project because of poor image quality or weak knot detection , but four were selected for use .",
    "these included two plates taken on back - to - back nights in 1951 , a better and deeper 1958 image ( @xcite , their fig .",
    "1 ) , and a superb 1976 image @xcite .",
    "modern ccd interference and broadband filter images of all or portions of the cas a remnant obtained from november 1988 through october 1999 were also measured .",
    "several of these have been used in prior studies , and a few were taken expressly for this project . some high resolution 1999 epoch wfpc2 _ hst _",
    "images were also used for several outlying northern and jet knots .",
    "we selected for measurement a total of 38 ejecta knots that had measurable positions on the palomar 1976 and later images ( @xmath35 t = 23 yr ) .",
    "many were outer knots , together with some shell knots visible from 1958 through 1999 ( @xmath35 t = 41 yr ) . nearly a dozen knots , mostly among the outer ejecta , were detectable from 1951 through 1999 , a span of almost 48 years , which is about 15% of cas a s age .",
    "it is unlikely that suitable earlier images exist .",
    "the palomar 5  m was completed in 1948 , coincident with the discovery of cas a as a localized radio source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the remnant has brightened significantly over the last half - century @xcite , and the individual knots often have finite visibility lifetimes ( kvdb76 ) .",
    "these factors set a practical limit of @xmath36 yr for the time span over which the proper motion can be studied at this time .",
    "of the 38 knots selected , 21 were main shell features and 17 were outer , higher - velocity knots in the ne jet or elsewhere .",
    "figure 1 shows the location of the selected knots .",
    "table 2 cross - lists our designations with those of earlier studies where possible .",
    "our two main knot selection criteria were : ( 1 ) _ distinct appearance with an absence of significant morphological changes .",
    "_ we looked for knots which were compact with steady morphologies that allowed secure identification and centroiding .",
    "none of the knots was perfect but some , like the bright outer knot 15 , provided excellent positional measurements over the entire 48 yr time span surveyed .",
    "like most other outlying fast - moving knots , it has a relatively stable morphology ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", main shell knots can show substantial changes in appearance on images separated by just 5 to 10 yr .",
    "consequently , we included only the most distinct and persistent main - shell features .",
    "the number of main - shell features we used was therefore relatively small compared to prior studies ( kvdb76 and vdbk83 ) .",
    "( 2 ) _ time span of visibility . _",
    "the longer a knot is measurable , the greater weight it has for determining the remnant s expansion center .",
    "we therefore biased our knot selection toward knots with long visibility time spans ( @xmath37 20 yr ) .",
    "this resulted in a much smaller knot sample than the 102 measured by kvdb76 .",
    "their knots covered time spans ranging from @xmath38 yr , with 46% of their knots visible for less than 15 yr .",
    "we began by constructing a grid of reference stars .",
    "first , centroids for several hundred unsaturated stars were measured on the h@xmath2 and [ s  ii ] @xmath396716,6731 images taken with the mdm 1.3  m telescope in 1992 july , using the iraf incarnation of daophot @xcite .",
    "we then cross - identified these stars with the usno a2.0 catalogue @xcite and derived a 6-constant linear plate model , rejecting stars with large residuals . because the centroids in the ccd data have much better internal precision than the usno a2.0 coordinates , we transformed the ccd centroids to right ascension and declination using the plate model , and averaged the results from the h@xmath2 and [ s  ii ] exposures .",
    "this procedure yielded right ascensions and declinations approximately on the international coordinate reference system ( icrs ) of the usno a2.0 , but with much higher internal precision .",
    "the usno a2.0 is based on the original palomar observatory sky survey plates , which for this field are epoch 1954.6 , so the elimination of high - residual stars removes stars with appreciable proper motions , as well as blended images and other difficult cases . for the final step",
    ", the refined celestial coordinates were converted to tangent - plane coordinates , using the kvdb76 center of expansion as the tangent point .",
    "the final reference grid consisted of 141 stars with red magnitudes ( from the usno a2.0 ) from 15.2 to 19.1 covering an @xmath40 field .    because this reference star grid is fundamental to all our results , we checked it for various sources of error : ( 1 ) errors in the grid s _",
    "coordinate zero point _ which would affect comparisons with other results , ( 2 ) _ proper motion _ of the grid stars , and ( 3 ) _ radial distortions _ in the grid which could cause a systematic error in the age estimate .",
    "below , we consider each of these sources of error in turn .",
    "we performed two checks on the positional zero point of the reference star grid .",
    "first , we examined the twelve reference stars ( for epoch 1965 ) tabulated by kvdb76 .",
    "we measured these stars on all the images on which they appeared , used our reference star net to derive positions and proper motion as described below for the knots , and compared the results to those tabulated in kvdb76 .",
    "ten of the 12 kvdb76 reference stars had sufficient observations in our data .",
    "for these , our right ascensions were on average 485 mas larger than theirs , with an rms scatter of 67 mas , while our declinations were 448 mas smaller , with a scatter of 112 mas .",
    "second , during the preparation of this work , the tycho-2 astrometric catalogue became available @xcite .",
    "four tycho-2 stars appear on enough images to derive good positions for epoch j2000 , and for three stars the time base gives adequate proper motions . because the stars were highly saturated in nearly all our pictures , we estimated the star centers and their uncertainties by eye .",
    "our derived epoch 2000 positions for the four tycho stars are , on average @xmath41 mas east and @xmath42 mas south of the catalogue positions , well within the accuracy to which the usno a2.0 is expected to align with the icrs .    the tycho and usno catalogues are based on hipparcos observations , which should provide much more reliable all - sky positions than the catalogs available to kvdb76 .",
    "we conclude that our grid is in registration with the icrs to within @xmath43 at worst , and that kvdb may have suffered a barely significant zero - point error .      in deriving plate models",
    ", we did not adjust the positions of our grid stars for proper motions .",
    "we implicitly assumed that the proper motions of the grid stars were small .",
    "our grid stars are on average only a little brighter than the dozen @xmath44 mag reference stars used by kvdb76 .",
    "they remark that stars this faint should have intrinsic proper motions from the solar motion and galactic rotation of @xmath45 mas yr@xmath17 .",
    "it is therefore likely that our grid stars motions are similarly small .",
    "a systematic offset @xmath46 in proper motions can seriously affect the derived center for the snr , since it displaces the center by @xmath47 .",
    "for the three tycho-2 stars for which proper motions could be derived on our reference grid , the weighted averages of @xmath48 were @xmath49 mas yr@xmath17 in right ascension and @xmath50 mas yr@xmath17 in declination . therefore , there was no evidence for a significant motion with respect to the icrs .",
    "the comparison with the kvdb reference stars was a bit more complex .",
    "they explicitly derived proper motions for their reference stars , and found a 9 mas yr@xmath17 mean proper motion in declination .",
    "they decided this was spurious and later adjusted their derived cas a center to account for the drift in their reference grid .",
    "reducing 10 of their reference stars with respect to our grid gives mean differences @xmath51 of @xmath52 mas yr@xmath17 in right ascension and @xmath53 mas yr@xmath17 in declination .",
    "this is just as expected on the basis of their remarks .",
    "indeed , our procedure is logically similar to theirs , but less complex : we simply assumed the faint grid to be motionless _ ab initio _ , while they derived proper motions and corrected them at the end to achieve the same result .",
    "finally , we checked our grid stars individually against the reference grid , deriving proper motions for each star based on all the images on which it appeared .",
    "formally , this was flawed by the inclusion of the star itself in the plate models , but with our sample of 140 stars , the effect should be negligible .",
    "grid stars observed over the whole range of dates had typical estimated proper motion uncertainties of @xmath54 mas yr@xmath17 , and relatively few showed significant proper motions . in the fitting procedure used for the images ( described below ) , grid stars with large residuals were iteratively clipped out , so the few stars with significant proper motions did not affect our results .    from all these tests",
    ", we conservatively estimate the grid to be inertial to within @xmath55 mas yr@xmath17 .",
    "the procedure used to set up the reference grid is valid provided that distortions in the field of the mdm 1.3 m telescope are insignificant .",
    "this is likely to be the case .",
    "@xcite measured the field distortions of several southern telescopes , including the ctio 1.5 m which , like the mdm 1.3 m , is an f/7.5 ritchey - chretien reflector .",
    "if one equipped the ctio 1.5 m with a ccd having the same size as that used in deriving our reference grid , then their radial distortion term @xmath56 would contribute only 7 mas at the corners of the field of view .    nonetheless , we searched for field distortions in several different ways .",
    "( 1 ) in fitting the usno a2.0 stars , we did not see any trends in the residuals from the 6-constant plate model .",
    "the usno a2.0 typically has centroiding errors in the 250  500 mas range . in view of the number of stars used ,",
    "this alone limits systematic trends to @xmath57 mas .",
    "( 2 ) we examined archival ccd images of the globular cluster m13 taken with the mdm 1.3 m and the same camera as the cas a images .",
    "kyle cudworth kindly provided us with a list of star positions in m13 , which he estimated were accurate to @xmath58 mas for relative positions .",
    "a six - constant fit of the ccd centroids to those positions gave an rms residual of 70 mas , again showing no obvious systematic trends .",
    "when a more elaborate model was used , the residuals were not improved significantly .",
    "the scatter is somewhat larger than expected , but does not seem to indicate any field distortions .",
    "( 3 ) in 1999 october we obtained a set of short @xmath59-band ccd exposures of cas a with the mdm 2.4  m telescope , covering an @xmath40 field .",
    "a 6-constant fit to the 124 standard reference stars included in this image gave an rms residual of 60 mas , without any iteration ; iterative clipping of high residuals brought this down to 34 mas , with 110 stars remaining .",
    "again , a more elaborate fit did not result in significant improvement .    because the reference grid is based on exposures taken with the mdm 1.3 m ,",
    "this last test simply compares the two telescopes .",
    "however , in january 2000 we also performed an astrometric calibration of the 2.4  m by obtaining two sets of short - exposure 2.4  m images of a portion of the @xcite astrometric standard region e. in one set of images , we fitted 172 stars to a 6-constant plate model .",
    "this gave a 153 mas rms residual .",
    "iterative elimination of the largest residuals brought this down to 53 mas with 114 stars .",
    "similar results were found with the other set of images .",
    "the residual maps of the two sets of images did not show systematic distortions , but were highly correlated with each other .",
    "this suggests that most of the error arises from the catalogue positions , probably due to the ( necessary ) inclusion of many stars near the faint limit of the catalogue .    in summary",
    ", the tests we made did not show any geometric distortion in our reference grid .",
    "the results suggest that systematic distortions are smaller than @xmath60 mas and that the centering precision of the reference stars is conservatively @xmath36 mas .",
    "we scanned the four palomar pf plates ( table 1 ) on the yale astronomy department s pds microdensitometer .",
    "we used a @xmath61 scanning aperture and sampled every 12.656 @xmath29 m in a @xmath62 raster centered on the remnant , the long dimension being east - west .",
    "the plate scale was @xmath63 mm@xmath17 , yielding @xmath64 pixel@xmath17 .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to derive star centers on for the palomar plates .",
    "the palomar 5  m prime - focus camera used a corrector which produced substantial radial distortions .",
    "similar corrector distortions have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "plate coordinates of the distortion center , @xmath65 , enter the least - squares models in a non - linear fashion , so following @xcite and @xcite we estimated @xmath65 in a separate step .",
    "we first fit the reference stars with a simple 6-constant plate model of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the standard reference star coordinate , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the coordinates on the palomar plate .",
    "this fit gave root - mean - square ( rms ) residuals of @xmath70 mas , with maximum values @xmath71 mas .",
    "the distortion center @xmath65 could then easily be estimated from the residual maps .",
    "these were then used in a 16-constant model of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "this model is similar to that used by @xcite , but without magnitude terms . as expected , these fits were much better ; after a few of the highest - residual stars were rejected , rms residuals ranged from 71 mas ( p7252 ) to 133 mas ( p553b ) .",
    "fitting the ccd images was more straightforward .",
    "we centroided the reference stars with daofind and matched them to their standard star @xmath74 coordinates .",
    "for the ground - based ccd images , there were always @xmath75 stars matched .",
    "because distortions in the ccd images were expected to be relatively small , we used the 6-constant model described above , with any unruly stars omitted by iterative clipping .",
    "reduction of the few hst images was not as simple .",
    "first , the images from the four ccds of the wfpc2 were interpolated onto a single grid using the _ wmosaic _ task in the iraf stsdas package , which approximately corrects for field distortions .",
    "unfortunately , the wfpc2 field of view is so small that one of our fields had only six reference stars .",
    "to increase the number of reference stars we measured some fainter stars on the ` wide [ s  ii ] ' 2.4  m image from 1999 october , transformed these over to the standard grid and used them in the fit to the hst data . with these added stars ,",
    "each hst field had at least 14 reference stars .",
    "the rms scatter for the 6-constant models was 50 to 55 mas .",
    "@xcite quote an rms scatter of 10 mas in their fit to the wfpc2 field distortions .",
    "the larger scatter found here probably arises from the errors in the reference star positions .",
    "in particular , there was no pattern indicating that the zero - point offsets between the ccds were different from those assumed by _",
    "wmosaic_.      we tried several methods to measure positions of the selected 38 knots .",
    "this was a somewhat complicated problem , since many of the knots were resolved in our images .",
    "the dominant source of centering uncertainty resulted from structure in the knots , rather than photon or grain noise . in the end , we simply estimated the knot centers by eye using a cursor on an image display .",
    "we allowed our judgment to be informed by centroids from such tools as the imexamine task in iraf and ( for the photographic scans ) the centers from sextractor .",
    "the selected knots often had ` head - tail ' structures , in which case we estimated the center of the head .",
    "some of the shell knots were embedded in nebulosity . in such cases , we tried to center on the brightest part of the knot .",
    "our uncertainty estimates were also subjective , but we attempted to err on the conservative side .",
    "when we later fit straight - line trajectories to the knots , we found that the residuals were often smaller than one would expect on the basis of our estimated uncertainties , demonstrating that our estimates were indeed conservative .",
    "for the photographic images , our estimated errors were guided by lower bounds on the error based on the noise in the plate fog , the central brightness of the knot , and the knot s angular size .",
    "these bounds were calibrated with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "once @xmath76 coordinates were measured on all the images , they were transformed to the tangent - plane coordinate system using the solutions described earlier .",
    "the rms scatter in the plate solution was added in quadrature to each the knot s estimated uncertainty .",
    "if the rms scatter was less than 40 mas , it was set to 40 mas to account for systematics .",
    "transformed knot positions were automatically collated with the exposure epochs for the images , yielding a time series of positions for each knot .",
    "finally , each knot s trajectory was fitted with a straight line , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the weighted mean epoch of observation , and similarly for @xmath79 .",
    "uncertainties were propagated into the coefficients in a standard manner .",
    "table 3 gives the results of this procedure .",
    "figure 2a shows the trajectories of our selected knots extrapolated back to a.d .",
    "1600 , somewhat before the estimated explosion date .",
    "the dots are the individual knot measurements with the width of each line indicating its statistical weight .    because the knots may have decelerated by varying amounts , we estimated the center using only the knots lines of position , and did not apply any constraints arising from the time dependence ( i.e , forcing the knots to start at the same epoch ) .",
    "we constructed a trajectory for each knot and computed its positional uncertainty @xmath80 near the time of the explosion by propagating the estimated position and proper motion errors . because of the long time lever , the proper motion uncertainty dominated the errors in all cases . with this information",
    "we could compute , for any @xmath81 and @xmath79 , a likelihood function of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the perpendicular distance between @xmath84 and the knot s line of position .",
    "the @xmath84 which maximizes this is our estimate of the expansion center .",
    "this procedure gave @xmath85 mas and @xmath86 mas , referred to the kvdb76 center .",
    "this translates into @xmath2(j2000 ) = 23@xmath3 23@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7(j2000 ) = 58@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the center derived using only the outer knots nearly coincided with that derived from the selected shell knots .",
    "table 4 lists our main shell and outer knot centroids separately along with our final values for the whole sample .",
    "the errors given are purely statistical , based on the monte carlo calibration of the centering errors ( see below ) .",
    "because our expansion center differs from those of previous estimates ( see below ) , we estimated our measurement uncertainties in several ways .",
    "since we have computed a likelihood function , the likelihood - ratio test described by @xcite can be used to form confidence contours .",
    "such contours , however , assume that the positional errors we estimated by eye are truly one standard deviation .",
    "the resulting 95% confidence contour is an oval slightly elongated northwest - southeast , with a radius @xmath87 .",
    "figure 3 is a magnified view of the center region , showing the lines of position together with the 95% to 99.5% confidence contours from this procedure .",
    "we also used a monte carlo simulation of the proper motion measurements to check our uncertainties and to normalize our error estimates .",
    "we began by assuming that the explosion occurred at the observed maximum - likelihood position .",
    "then , taking each knot s present position as known and fixed ( because the proper motions dominate the errors ) , we computed an idealized proper motion for each knot , which extrapolated back exactly to the observed maximum - likelihood position .",
    "we next created 1000 artificial data sets by adding gaussian random noise to the idealized proper motions .",
    "for each artificial data set , we computed the maximum - likelihood center and its associated maximum @xmath88 .    in the first trials , the standard deviation used for the gaussian noise was simply the estimated proper motion uncertainty of each knot  in effect , we took our estimated position errors to be realistic . for nearly all the trials ,",
    "this choice led to maximum values of @xmath88 larger than observed , indicating that the errors in the proper motions were overestimated ( as expected since our error estimates were believed conservative ) .",
    "in the final monte carlo calculation , we multiplied the proper motion standard deviations by a global ` fudge factor ' @xmath89 .",
    "these simulated data sets yielded maximum values of @xmath90 very similar to that of the real data .",
    "the spread in the positions generated by this procedure should be a realistic indicator of the uncertainty in the centroid .",
    "the cloud of monte carlo positions is also shown in figure 3 and has standard deviations in @xmath81 and @xmath79 of 398 and 366 mas , respectively .",
    "half of the points lie within 448 mas of the mean position and 95% within 946 mas .",
    "this agrees well with the likelihood - ratio test described above once the scaling factor of 0.7 is taken into account and provides a cross - check on the likelihood - ratio procedure .    as an additional check",
    ", we divided our data into two samples  shell knots and outer knots .",
    "the outer knots gave @xmath91 mas , @xmath92 mas with half the monte carlo points within 508 mas of the mean ; the shell knots gave @xmath93 mas and @xmath94 mas , with half within 783 mas .",
    "the disagreements between these and the combined data are about as expected given the estimated statistical errors .    in a final statistical experiment we repeatedly selected half the knots at random found the maximum likelihood center of the subsample . for this we used the observed trajectories without adding artificial noise .",
    "the distribution of the centers produced by 1000 such trials was rather elongated east - west ( @xmath95 mas , @xmath96 mas ) , but did not extend toward a particular direction ( e.g. , the kvdb76 and vdbk83 center ) .",
    "this shows that our center determination is not thrown off by a few stray knots .",
    "previous center of expansion values from optical and radio data are listed in table 4 .",
    "the first accurate estimate of cas a s expansion point was made by @xcite using palomar 5  m pf plates of 27 `` fast - moving knots '' covering the time period 1951 through 1969 .",
    "@xcite later updated this to include a total of 102 knots covering the additional period @xmath97 .",
    "this study itself was supplemented by @xmath98 measurements of 46 especially long - lived knots by @xcite .",
    "the last two studies reached essentially the same central position estimate within measurement errors .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a significantly different expansion point based on a least - squares spherical fit to a plot of main shell knot radial velocities .",
    "this displaced center reflects radial velocity differences between back and front hemispheres and is thus unlikely to be an accurate measure of the remnant s expansion center .",
    "our estimated center lies only 3 arc seconds due north of the center derived by kvdb76 and vdbk83 , but this is well outside their @xmath99 estimated uncertainty .",
    "although our study includes far fewer knots ( 38 ) than they used , our results have smaller formal errors and the trajectories have a smaller dispersion . for comparison",
    "we show in figure 2b trajectories of the 102 knots measured in the kvdb76 study at the same scale as the trajectories in figure 2a .",
    "the larger spread in knot trajectories in the kvdb76 data largely reflects inclusion of fewer outlying knots and more main shell knots in their study .",
    "finally , we note that the two reported centers derived from radio measurements lie significantly ( @xmath2415@xmath22 ) east of the centers estimated from the optical knots . because the remnant s radio emission does not exhibit a smooth , globally - coherent radial expansion @xcite , we believe that radio - derived centers are less meaningful .      first - light _",
    "_ observations of cas  a revealed the presence of a point - like x - ray source near the center @xcite .",
    "the source was subsequently confirmed through inspection of archival _ rosat _ @xcite and _ einstein _ data @xcite .",
    "the x - ray source s position has been refined slightly using further _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "table 5 lists this refined _ chandra _ position , together with those estimated from investigations of _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ hri data .",
    "figure 4 shows the _ chandra _ position , and both kvdb76 s and our expansion centers superposed on an optical image of the central region .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray point source lies some @xmath13 south ( position angle @xmath16 354@xmath15 ) of our derived center of expansion for cas a. our new expansion center actually lies _ farther away _ from the _ chandra _ position than does the kvdb76 center .",
    "both the _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ observations , however , place the x - ray point source a few arc seconds farther to the west and north , thus closer to our expansion center . assuming a common origin for the ejecta knots and the point source , our center and the _ chandra _ position together imply a transverse velocity of @xmath16 330 km s@xmath17 at a distance of 3.4 kpc .",
    "this velocity is not unusual for a young pulsar , if this is indeed what it is @xcite .",
    "limits on the date of the cas a sn explosion bear on two questions .",
    "first , could flamsteed have seen it in a.d .",
    "second , how much have the knots decelerated over the last 300 yr ?",
    "the outer and shell knot trajectories give significantly different ages , in the sense expected if the shell knots have decelerated more than the outer knots due to their interaction with a reverse shock .",
    "this trend is clearly visible in figure 5 , which shows the times at which the individual knots are computed to have passed closest to the center ( assuming no deceleration ) ; we will refer to this quantity as the _ crossing time_. ( note : the center position used to compute the crossing times is derived from the whole data set .",
    "the knots move quickly enough that small variations in the placement of the center do not affect the trend . )    because of their smaller deceleration , the outer knots offer a better estimate of the date of the cas a supernova than ejecta in the bright shell . a straight average of the 17 outer knots crossing times yields an explosion date of @xmath100 , while the 21 main shell knots yield @xmath101 .",
    "on the face of it , the outer knot data indicate a date nine years earlier than flamsteed s 1680 sighting of 3 cas . however , a deceleration of only @xmath102 mas yr@xmath103 for the outer knots would change the date by @xmath104 years . in our best - observed knots",
    "the 1@xmath105 uncertainty in the deceleration approaches this value , but none of the knots show significant deceleration .",
    "there is also no trend for the fitted acceleration vectors to be pointed inward toward the center .",
    "thus we can neither directly detect nor disprove decelerations large enough to make flamsteed s a.d .",
    "1680 sighting coincide with the explosion .",
    "the dispersion in the knots crossing times also affects the case for flamsteed s 1680 sighting .",
    "as noted above , the mean crossing time is displaced from 1680 . if in addition the dispersion in crossing times were small , then in order for flamsteed to have seen the explosion the different knots would need to have suffered nearly identical decelerations .",
    "this would be unlikely given the typical inhomogeneity of the ism .",
    "however , figure 5 shows enough scatter in the crossing times that a flamsteed sighting remains plausible .",
    "if we assume for a moment that the explosion date really was 1680 and that the knots have decelerated uniformly ever since , we can then compute an implied deceleration for each knot .",
    "for the nine best shell knots ( those with formal 1-@xmath105 crossing time uncertainties less than 5 years ) , these implied decelerations range from 0.04 mas yr@xmath103 for knot 9 to 0.14 mas yr@xmath103 for knot 120 , with a mean of 0.10 mas yr@xmath17 . at 3.4 kpc",
    ", 0.10 mas yr@xmath17 corresponds to a transverse acceleration of only 1.6 km s@xmath17 yr@xmath17 or a velocity change of some 2  5% over the age of the remnant .",
    "detecting velocity changes @xmath106 km s@xmath17 yr@xmath17 in these faint , outer ejecta knots to test plausible explosion dates would be difficult , but perhaps not impossible .",
    "the sudden brightening of knot 19 along the remnant s western limb during the early 1970 s @xcite suggests it may be decelerating significantly at the present epoch . a direct measurements of a knot s present - day deceleration could , in principle , be used to explore the density of the interstellar or circumstellar medium around the remnant .",
    "but at present not enough is known about the knots masses , dimensions , and structure to draw reliable conclusions about their environment from their decelerations .      as a check on the center and explosion date estimates , we also estimated these quantities jointly . using the fitted knot trajectories , we stepped through a range of dates @xmath107 around the explosion . at each date , we computed the weighted mean position of the knots , and then computed @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the angular distance of knot @xmath110 from the mean center at date @xmath107 .",
    "the estimated explosion date is then @xmath111 , the date which minimizes @xmath112 .",
    "the weighted mean position of the knots at @xmath111 is an estimate of the explosion center .",
    "this procedure yielded @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the outer knots , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for the shell knots , and @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for the entire sample of knots .",
    "because the knots in our sample are distributed non - uniformly around the remnant s periphery , differences in date translate into differences in position in a complicated way .",
    "the likely differential deceleration of the knots therefore makes this estimate less reliable than the previous estimate , which is based on lines of position .",
    "nonetheless , the results are broadly similar  all the estimates put the best center significantly north of kvdb76 s center , and the shell knots show evidence of deceleration .",
    "our new proper motions of 21 main - shell and 17 higher - velocity , outer ejecta knots in cas a leads to improved estimates of the center of expansion and the age .",
    "we find the expansion center to be @xmath2(j2000 ) = 23@xmath3 23@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7(j2000 ) = 58@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 , with little difference between the centers derived using outer or main shell knots .",
    "this expansion point lies @xmath13 @xmath14 to the north of the recently recognized x - ray point source .",
    "if the point source originated in the explosion , the position offset implies a transverse velocity of @xmath16 330 km s@xmath17 at a distance of 3.4 kpc .",
    "using the outer knots , most of which are in front of the main blast wave , we estimate a date of explosion of 1671.3 @xmath180.9 assuming no deceleration .",
    "however , interaction with local csm / ism should decelerate the knots .",
    "if the velocities have declined by only a few percent over the age of the remnant , the remnant age would be consistent with a suspected sighting of the supernova by j. flamsteed in 1680 .",
    "the age derived from the main shell knots is greater by 9 yr than that derived from the outer knots , implying a greater deceleration of the main shell .",
