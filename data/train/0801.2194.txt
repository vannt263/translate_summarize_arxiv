    "in recent years a number of searches for high redshift supernovae ( sne ) have been conducted .",
    "although the primary purpose of most of these surveys is measurement of the cosmic expansion , these surveys also allowed measurements of the cosmic supernova rate density and its evolution @xcite .",
    "studying these data should provide us with important information not only for the cosmic star formation history ( csfh ) but also the still unknown progenitor of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "the progenitor of sne ia is believed to be a binary system including a white dwarf , and the sn ia rate density evolution is a convolution of the cosmic star formation history and the delay time distribution ( dtd ) from star formation to sn ia events .",
    "dtd depends on the progenitor models , and hence to constrain dtd observationally is a useful approach to reveal the sn ia progenitor ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; yungelson & livio 1998 , 2000 ; dahlen & fransson 1999 ; gilliland et al .",
    "1999 ; gal - yam & maoz 2004 ; strolger et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ; barris et al . 2004 ; oda & totani 2005 , hereafter ot05 ; strigari et al . 2005 ) .    however , it is not an easy task to actually extract useful constraints from the sn rate density evolution data .",
    "previous studies @xcite mainly concentrated on the determination of dtd , using the rate density evolution of sne ia . in such an analysis , sometimes csfh models are assumed based on the observational estimates from high-@xmath10 galaxy surveys .",
    "however , as argued by @xcite , the constraint on dtd models sensitively depends on the assumed csfh , and hence it is difficult to derive a robust constraint on dtd .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to perform a comprehensive likelihood analysis using all available sn rate density evolution data in the literature , to derive constraints on dtd and/or csfh .",
    "after the goods high-@xmath10 supernova survey @xcite , whose data was used in @xcite and @xcite , a number of observational estimates of sn rate density evolution have been published ( mostly for sne ia , but some data also for cc sne ) .",
    "our approach is to derive constraints only by using sn rate data , without using information of csfh from galaxy surveys .",
    "we will perform a simultaneous fit to both the sn ia and cc sn rate density evolution data , surveying parameters of the csfh model with a variety of dtd models .",
    "we will find that , though a strong constraint on dtd models can not be derived even from all the available data so far , we can set interesting constraints on csfh and evolution of mean dust extinction of cc sne , which can be compared with those inferred from galaxy surveys .",
    "although there are a number of observational estimates on csfh at a variety of redshifts from galaxy surveys , there is still a large uncertainty in the star formation rate ( sfr ) density estimated from galaxy observations , because of extinction , initial mass function , or extrapolation of luminosity functions to fainter magnitudes below the detection limits ( see hopkins 2004 and hopkins & beacom 2006 , and reference therein ) . therefore it is useful and important to derive constraints on csfh from sne independently of galaxy surveys .",
    "in contrast to sfr density estimates by galaxies , detectability of sne does not depend on the host galaxy brightness , and even intergalactic star formation activity can be probed by hostless sne .",
    "searches for @xmath11 sne are typically performed at wavelength around the @xmath12 and @xmath13 band roughly corresponding to the rest - frame visual bands , and hence the effect of extinction by dust is expected to be smaller than the csfh estimates based on the rest - frame uv emission of galaxies .",
    "it is not trivial that a unit mass of star formation always produces the same number of sne , but it could evolve with redshift or physical properties of galaxies . if a significant difference between csfh inferred from galaxy surveys and that from sn surveys is found , it might indicate that the relation between star formation and supernova production is not as simple as normally assumed .",
    "in addition to the available sn rate density data in the literature , we also utilize the photometric sample of sn candidates found in the past observations using subaru / sprime - cam .",
    "this subaru supernova survey ( sss ) sample includes 157 supernova candidates , 61 out of which have clear offsets from the centers of host galaxies and hence they are most likely sne .",
    "this data set is complementary to goods , snls and the ifa deep survey @xcite in terms of the combination of the survey area and depth ; the covered area of sss , @xmath14 deg@xmath15 , is wider than the goods , and the sss depth , @xmath16 , is deeper than the snls and the ifa deep survey . though no sn type or redshift information is available for the sss sample , we add this data set to our likelihood analysis to increase the statistics especially for cc sne .",
    "compared with sne ia , there are not many data of the rate density for cc sne .",
    "combined analysis of the sss counts including all sne and other data for sn ia rate density evolution should give some constraints on the cc sn rate density evolution and hence csfh .",
    "the following are the plan of this paper . in  [ sec : data ] and  [ sec : obs_res ] we describe the sss data set and analysis procedure of selecting sn candidates .",

    "the standard @xmath17cdm universe is assumed with the following values of the cosmological parameters : @xmath18 = 0.3 , @xmath19 = 0.7 , @xmath20/ ( 70 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 ) = 1 . all magnitudes are given in the ab magnitude system .",
    "the sss data set consists of the following three fields , named a2152 , ms1520.1 , and the spring field ( sf ) , whose positions on the sky are given in table [ table : fields ] .",
    "all images are taken with the subaru / suprime - cam @xcite having an effective field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath22 , with a time interval of about one month that is suitable for a high - z supernova search .",

    "about one month after the first imaging of this field ( 2003 may 5 ) , the field was imaged again during four consecutive nights ( june 14 ) .",
    "images were taken with @xmath25 and @xmath26 band filters and typical exposure time is a few hours for each filter per day , but we use only the @xmath26 band images for our supernova search .",
    "about 40 % of supernova candidates found in @xmath26 band data of this field were not detected on @xmath25 band images , while there is no sn candidate that was detected only in @xmath25 band .    _",
    "ms1520.1 field _ ",
    "a single fov of the suprime - cam was observed around the galaxy cluster ms1520.1 + 3002 at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "observations were performed on april 25 and may 20 in 2001 with the @xmath12 band filter .",
    "the exposure time is about one hour .",
    "it should be noted that the expected number of supernovae in the galaxy clusters in the ms 1520.1 and a2152 fields is too small to affect the conclusions of this paper ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2002 ; sharon et al .",
    "2007 ) , and hence the existence of these clusters is not taken into account in our theoretical modeling .    _ the spring field _",
    " there are four adjacent suprime - cam images of this field in @xmath12 band , which we call sf 1 - 4 .",
    "the first images were taken on march 19 , and the second and third ones were on april 9 and 11 , in 2002 .",
    "typical exposure time of each field is about one hour , but the observational conditions of sf2 and sf3 are better than those of sf1 and sf4 .",
    "this field and the ms1520.1 field were observed as a part of the supernova cosmology project .",
    "thus , the observation was designed to find high redshift sne ia for the cosmological purpose , and follow - up spectroscopic observations of some supernova candidates were performed . as a result ,",
    "three sne ( 2002fc , 2002fd and 2002fe ) are clearly identified to be sne ia , and another sn ( 2002ff ) is a possible candidate of sn ia .",
    "their redshifts are 0.88 , 0.278 , 1.086 , and 1.1 , respectively .",
    "( see iau circ .",
    "7971 for more details . )",
    "all of these are included in our sn candidates , but the information obtained with spectroscopic follow - up is not used , because the majority of the sne in the sss sample do not have spectroscopic information , and adding these spectroscopic information hardly affects the conclusions of this paper .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        now we have a robust sample of supernovae , i.e. , the 61 variable objects associated with host galaxies and their locations are off - center on the host galaxies ( @xmath28 pix and @xmath29 ) .",
    "because of these properties , the majority of them should be supernovae rather than agns .",
    "a possible contamination is chance superpositions of background agns in front of unrelated foreground galaxies ( gal - yam et al .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of such events as follows . from the statistics of a similar variable object search by morokuma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using the subaru xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) data set , about 40 agns are expected in the sss data .",
    "the surface area covered by galaxies with a similar magnitude to that of host galaxies in the sss is about 5% of the total survey area , and hence we expect a few random superpositions .",
    "this number is much smaller than the off - center supernova candidates , and hence this effect can be neglected .",
    "when variable objects are on the center of their host galaxies , we can not discriminate between the two possibilities of supernovae or agns .",
    "however , some of these objects show very faint variability flux compared with the total magnitude of the host galaxies , and these objects are most likely to be low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) with very low accretion rate as reported in @xcite , because supernovae are generally as bright as the brightest class of galaxies .",
    "in fact , we found no off - center sn candidates associated with galaxies brighter than @xmath30 .",
    "therefore we removed 15 variable objects that are located at the center of very bright galaxies ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the remaining 73 on - center variable objects are then called as `` on - center supernova candidates '' , though we can not exclude a contamination of agns in this sample . however ,",
    "if we assume that supernovae trace the light of the host galaxies , we can estimate the expected number of on - center supernovae from the number of off - center supernovae , by extrapolation of a surface brightness profile .",
    "we find that 32 and 129 on - center supernovae are expected for the exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles , respectively .",
    "the reality is likely between the two , and if we assume the srsic profile , we find that the expected number becomes the same as the observed number with the srsic s index of @xmath32 .",
    "these results indicate that at least about half of the on - center objects are supernovae ( corresponding to the exponential profile ) .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in the previous subsection , we expect about 40 agns in the sss from the statistics of the sxds variable object search ( morokuma et al .",
    "2007 ) , i.e. , about a half of the on - center candidates .",
    "the effect of agn contamination in the on - center sample will be examined when we will compare the theoretical model of supernova rate evolution to the observed data .      the variable objects without host galaxies",
    "should also be examined since supernovae may be included in them .",
    "first we notice that there are objects that are clearly much brighter than expected for supernovae . in the off - center supernova sample , there is no object brighter than @xmath33 in the variability magnitude .",
    "however , 10 objects in the no - host sample are brighter than this magnitude in spite of the no - detection of a host .",
    "these objects are most likely variable quasars or variable stars in our galaxy , and hence they are rejected from the supernova candidates .",
    "then , the remaining 23 objects are defined as the no - host supernova candidates without detectable host galaxies , and there is no marked difference between the variability magnitude distributions of this sample and the off - center supernovae .",
    "thus , although we can not exclude significant contamination from quasars and galactic variable stars , most of these are possibly supernovae with host galaxies that are fainter than the detection threshold ( @xmath34 ) or truly intergalactic supernovae . to examine the former possibility , we estimate @xmath35 , which is the fraction of supernovae in host galaxies that are detectable by sss .",
    "we assume that the supernova rate in a galaxy is proportional to the rest - frame @xmath36-band luminosity of a host galaxy .",
    "this is an assumption that should not be accurately correct ; cc sne are expected to trace galactic light in shorter wavelength such as rest - frame uv , and sne ia with a long delay time would trace longer wavelength light that is related to the stellar mass .",
    "however , our data set is limited about available band filters , and we make this assumption for the present data set",
    ".    then we can estimate @xmath35 by the @xmath36-band luminosity function of galaxies at a given @xmath10 and the sss detection limit for galaxies .",
    "we assume the following values and redshift evolution of the schechter parameters of the luminosity function : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , from the observations by @xcite .",
    "the k - correction between the observed band ( @xmath12 or @xmath39 ) and the rest - frame @xmath36 are calculated assuming the sbc galaxy template .",
    "the calculated correction factors in this way is @xmath40 0.90 , 0.79 and 0.72 for @xmath41 0.5 , 0.8 , and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "the typical redshifts of sne that should be detectable in sss is @xmath420.5 and 1.0 for cc sne and sne ia , respectively , and we detected 134 supernova candidates with detectable host galaxies .",
    "therefore , most or perhaps all of the 23 no - host candidates can be explained by those associated with galaxies under the detection limit . in other words , there is no evidence for a significant population of intergalactic supernova population .      as a result of the above selection procedures",
    ", we find 157 supernova candidates in total , including 73 on - center , 61 off - center , and 23 no - host candidates .",
    "images of representative objects of these classification are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] , as well as the images of those classified as non - sne objects .",
    "a summary of the results for each field is presented in table [ table : num_counts ] .",
    "the distribution of the variability magnitude of these supernova candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snhist ] , as well as the estimated detection efficiency .",
    "the behavior of the faint end of the distribution is in reasonable agreement with the detection efficiency estimate .",
    "no considerable field - to - field variation is found .",
    "( 160mm,70mm)figure4_low.eps    ( 160mm,70mm)./figure5.eps      in the following likelihood analysis including the sss data , we will present two cases of ( i ) using all of the on- and off - center sss samples and ( ii ) using only the off - center sss sample . in the former case , all on - center and off - center",
    "sn candidates are assumed to be the real supernovae . in the latter case ,",
    "the effect of the removal of central regions of host galaxies is corrected assuming that the supernova distribution obeys the exponential profile as calculated in  [ sec : on - center ] . for this correction",
    "we simply multiplied a factor of 0.65 to the theoretical prediction of the cosmic sn rate density , since the mean fraction of light in central regions of all host galaxies in the sss is 0.35 .",
    "as described in  [ sec : on - center ] , the exponential profile corresponds to assuming that about half of on - center candidates are the real supernovae .",
    "since the exponential profile is the least concentrated one among the various profiles assumed in the literature , the reality should be between the above two cases and hence we can check the systematic uncertainty about the agn contamination by this treatment .    we do not include the no - host supernova candidates in the following analysis , since we can not exclude the contamination by variable quasars or galactic variable stars in this sample .",
    "we have already shown in  [ sec : no - host - snc ] that the number of no - host candidates is similar to that expected by sne with host galaxies under the detection limit , and hence there is no evidence for a significant population of truly intergalactic supernovae .",
    "therefore , we only make a correction for sne that are classified as no - host because their host galaxies are fainter than the detection limit , by using the quantity @xmath35 calculated in  [ sec : no - host - snc ] .",

    ", we use the theoretical models constructed by @xcite for a wide variety of the progenitor models ( single or double degenerate , and others ) .",
