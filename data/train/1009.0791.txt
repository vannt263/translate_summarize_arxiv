    "in systems of interacting degrees of freedom , decreasing the thermal fluctuations often leads to the formation of ordered states .",
    "the traditional , and natural , measure of these fluctuations is the temperature @xmath0 itself , which then forms one axis of the associated phase diagrams .",
    "however entropy @xmath1 can also be used to quantify the amount of disorder .",
    "indeed , a phase diagram using @xmath1 as an axis naturally provides a somewhat different perspective on the topology of the ordered and disordered regions- since the entropy changes more rapidly where transitions occur , it magnifies these interesting portions of the phase diagram .",
    "recent experiments@xcite on trapped ultracold atoms in optical lattices have provided a further motivation for employing the entropy as one of the variables in describing phase diagrams.@xcite in these systems , the temperature and entropy of the atomic cloud are known prior to the adiabatic ramp - up of the optical lattice , but the precise change in temperature during this process is uncertain .",
    "thus the determination of the entropy values at which various phenomena occur , like local moment formation , magnetic ordering , and so forth , is important , supplementing the more typical discussion of the temperatures at which these phenomena occur .",
    "furthermore , since attaining low temperatures is crucial for the emulation of many - body ordering effects seen in solid state systems , a central question is whether @xmath0 rises or falls ( adiabatic heating or cooling ) as the optical lattice is established .",
    "this work examines the isentropic curves of two models of magnetic phase transitions .",
    "the two - dimensional blume - capel model ( bcm)@xcite is studied first , and its thermodynamics are computed both in mean field theory ( mft ) and with monte carlo ( mc ) methods . an itinerant ( quantum ) hamiltonian , the fermion hubbard model ( fhm ) is next examined within mft .",
    "the isentropes of the fhm are compared with recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite results at half - filling , a density at which qmc can be performed to low temperatures .",
    "the isentropes are also computed when the system is doped away from half - filling , a parameter regime where phases with long range order are inaccessible to qmc .",
    "the bcm and fhm form an interesting pair of models to compare , since both contain two energy scales , one which controls the density and the other which tunes the strength of spin - spin interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii presents both the bcm and the fhm , and the computational methods used .",
    "iii then details the isentropes of the bcm , while sec .",
    "iv focused on the fhm .",
    "v summarizes and further discusses the results .",
    "the blume - capel model@xcite is , @xmath2 the spins @xmath3 can take three values @xmath4 , where the value @xmath5 can be regarded as a ` vacancy ' .",
    "the first term in the energy represents a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath6 between near - neighbor spins .",
    "the second term provides an impurity chemical potential @xmath7 for the vacancies .",
    "when @xmath7 is large and negative , vacancies are suppressed , and the bcm maps onto the ising model . here",
    "we will consider a square lattice geometry .",
    "the presence of a three component spin gives rise to the possibility of first order transitions and tricritical behavior , as first emphasized in [ ] .",
    "part of the original motivation for the bcm was to provide a description of the tricritical phenomena induced by @xmath8he vacancies in superfluid @xmath9he.@xcite since its introduction , the bcm has been extensively studied,@xcite both in the form given in eq .",

    "we compared two different mc approaches for computing entropy in the bcm : thermodynamic integration and the wang - landau ( wl ) algorithm . with thermodynamic integration ,",
    "the entropy is computed by making multiple mc runs at different , fixed inverse temperatures @xmath16 and integrating , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the entropy and energy per site , respectively .",
    "equation [ eq : thermint ] is obtained by applying integration by parts@xcite to the standard relation of entropy to the specific heat : @xmath20 . for the bcm , @xmath21 , reflecting the three possible choices of spin . in most instances ,",
    "this approach produces better results , since it does not rely on the determination of specific heat @xmath22 , which is noisier than the energy @xmath23 .",
    "the wl algorithm is a flat - histogram mc method for calculating the density of states @xmath24 . in this method ,",
    "a random walk is performed in the energy space of the bcm , sampling @xmath25 with a probability proportional to @xmath26 and adjusting the distribution of @xmath24 until each energy ( e ) value has close to the same probability . ultimately , this process produces a flat histogram of occurrence for all energy states in the random walk .",
    "since the density of energy states that results is independent of temperature , we can compute the partition function @xmath27 for any temperature .",
    "consequently , we can determine the value for any thermodynamic variable of interest- in our case , the free energy and entropy- without performing multiple mc simulations at different @xmath16 .",
    "figures and analysis reported for bcm will be those from wl results on 16x16 lattices .",
    "the values obtained for the entropy with the two methods , however , were found to be equivalent to within a fraction of a percent .",

    ", this provides a central motivation for this paper .",
    "our mft approach is the usual one in which each term of the interaction is decoupled : @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting quadratic hamiltonians @xmath39 are diagonalized , and the expectation values @xmath40 recomputed .",
    "the process is iterated to self - consistency , a process which minimizes the free energy @xmath41 . to be somewhat more precise ,",
    "the mft calculation is actually performed in momentum space by making particular , simple , paramagnetic ( p ) , ferromagnetic ( f ) , and antiferromagnetic ( af ) _ ansatz _ for the real space expectation values @xmath42 .",
    "such a choice does not allow for more complex spatial patterns of charge and spin such as are present in striped phases.@xcite our results for the isentropic curves of the fhm will be obtained exclusively within mft .",
    "it is possible to obtain these curves using more exact approaches like qmc,@xcite but only in parameter regimes like half - filling where there is no sign problem.previous dynamical mean field theory work has also reported data for the isentropes on a cubic lattice.@xcite",
    "we begin our analysis of the isentropic curves by discussing the @xmath43 limit of a collection of independent spin-1 sites .",

[ eq : jeq0b ] , the isentropic condition , @xmath47 implies that @xmath48 , where the constant @xmath49 is obtained by solving the transcendental equation , @xmath50    we immediately see that the isentropic curves are straight lines @xmath51 . note that for values of @xmath52 greater than @xmath53 , there are two solutions for @xmath54 , one positive and one negative , representing positive and negative values of @xmath7 . in this single site limit ,",
    "values of @xmath7 less than zero will suppress all vacancies , preventing entropy values less than @xmath55 .    despite the simple nature of this calculation",

    "we see that in traveling along an isentrope of increasing @xmath7 from @xmath56 , the temperature @xmath0 decreases , since one moves along a line with @xmath57 . ultimately , one reaches @xmath58 where the sign of @xmath49 changes to positive , and further movement along the isentrope results in an increase in temperature .",
    "the interesting question is , of course , how the topology of the isentropes of the noninteracting systems is altered by interactions and , in particular by the strong collective effects which occur near the magnetic phase boundary .",
    "having discussed the @xmath43 limit , we now address the isentropic curves of the bcm treated within mft . solving the self - consistency eq  [ eq : selfconsist ] , we show the resulting isentropes in fig .  [",

    "the entropy decreases in this traversal of the pb to higher @xmath7 values at fixed @xmath0 due to the large reduction in the spin density @xmath13 .",

    "all three spin states are present with higher entropy .",
    "in contrast , at the second order boundary ( dashed green line in fig .  [",

    "as we will see shortly , the precise details of this behavior are peculiar to the mft and do not carry over to the exact ( mc ) solutions which incorporate short range correlations and fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless the general topology of the isentropes in mft agree with those of mc .",
    "the phase diagram of the bcm was determined by first using the wl density of states to compute thermodynamic variables , the free energy @xmath61 , entropy @xmath18 , specific heat @xmath22 , and magnetic susceptibility @xmath62 , for a fine grid of points in the ( @xmath7,@xmath0)-plane .",

    "however , at intermediate @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the isentropes are rounded , especially in the vicinity of the phase boundary .",
    "indeed , the boundary between adiabatic heating and cooling does not precisely follow the pb but instead occurs along a separate trajectory of somewhat larger impurity chemical potential .    as discussed in [",
    "] , the key qualitative feature of the isentropes is that they move out to higher @xmath0 as they leave either side of the phase boundary ( into the paramagnetic or ferromagnetic phases ) .",

    "the temperature must increase .",
    "if an experiment were performed in which @xmath7 were ramped , the lattice would cool as the phase boundary is approached from the ferromagnetic side , and heat as one moves away into the paramagnet .     or chemical potential @xmath7 rise .",

    "[ fig : bc_mc_entropy_bw ] , with the those for spin density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc_mc_spindensity ] , we see that as we traverse the first order phase boundary , the spin density changes more rapidly as the temperature @xmath0 approaches zero .",
    "in fact , this is consistent with clausius - clapeyron equation which relates the slope of the phase boundary with the change in entropy and spin density by , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 stand for entropy in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases respectively .",

    "closer to half - filling , magnetic phases arise , with antiferromagnetism af predominating immediately adjacent to @xmath77 and ferromagnetism f a bit farther away , at sufficiently large @xmath34 .",
    "the phase diagram is symmetric about @xmath77 , as a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry of the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice with near - neighbor hopping .",

    "as discussed earlier , the associated isentropes are parallel to the @xmath79 axis in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "they then bend to higher @xmath80 as @xmath79 increases in the antiferromagnet .",
    "this adiabatic heating is explained by the same reasoning as for the classical bcm case : the phase boundary represents a location of particularly high entropy , so that for @xmath1 to remain fixed as one leaves its vicinity the temperature must increase .",
    "the gross morphology for the isentropes found in fig .",
    "[ fig : isenn1.0 ] agrees well with exact qmc calculations@xcite which can be performed with no sign problem in this half - filled case .",
    "the qmc method , which is exact , of course captures the fact that there is no finite temperature phase transition in the square lattice fhm .",
    "the role of the phase boundary there is played by the temperature scale of the mean field charge gap , which is determined by the plateau in @xmath13 versus @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig : isenn0.8 ] shows the analogous phase boundaries and isentropes for @xmath81 . here the structure is much richer since there are three possible phases for this density , with the paramagnet first giving way to antiferromagnetic order as @xmath79 is increased , followed by a second transition to ferromagnetism . in this case the isentropes can bend either to higher or to lower @xmath0 as the af boundary is left with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath0 occurs at lower @xmath80 where the f boundary is more proximate to the af one .",

    "[ fig : n0.4t0.2mfmaf ] .",

    "an interesting feature of the p @xmath93 af phase boundary at @xmath81 is that the critical @xmath34 initially _ decreases _ as the temperature @xmath0 _ increases_. put another way , as @xmath0 is lowered for @xmath94 there is a p @xmath93 af ordering transition , but then there is a re - entrance to the p phase as @xmath0 is reduced further .",

    "in this paper , the isentropic curves of a classical system of magnetism , the blume - capel model , and of the quantum fermion hubbard hamiltonian , have been determined .",
    "in the case of the bcm , mean field theory and monte carlo ( wang - landau ) calculations give a qualitatively similar pictures in which adiabatic heating is observed as one moves away from the phase boundary , although the precise , quantitative location of the transition is , of course , different in the two methods .",
    "the behavior of the isentropes is made somewhat more complex by the presence of a tricritical point on the bcm phase boundary , so that there is a region at low @xmath0 and large vacancy fraction where the curves are discontinuous .",
    "for the fhm , we have presented only mft results , since the sign problem in general prevents quantum monte carlo simulations at low temperatures .",
    "the topology of the isentropes , like the phase diagram itself , is relatively simple at half - filling , consisting of lines parallel to the @xmath34 axis in the paramagnetic phase , and then trending upwards as the antiferromagnetic boundary is crossed .",
    "for this half - filled case , qmc is possible , and we have compared our mft results to those calculations .",

    "it is well known that mft predicts some qualitatively incorrect features of the fhm phase diagram , including , for example , the existence of a finite temperature nel transition",
    ". nevertheless , the rough morphology of the isentropes within mft and qmc are similar , with the role of the mft phase boundary played by the temperature of the charge gap , which is clearly seen to open at nonzero temperatures .",
    "this provides some assurance that the mft results will remain qualitatively accurate in the doped case , even in the absence of exact qmc results at low temperatures there .",
    "optical lattice experiments for bosons@xcite and fermions@xcite have reached temperatures ( @xmath97 in the bosonic case ) that provide strong evidence of the mott transition .",
