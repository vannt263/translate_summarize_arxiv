    "scattering of light by periodic metallic structures has been well studied for over a century in the context of diffraction gratings.@xcite the subject has recently received renewed attention@xcite with the prediction@xcite and experimental observation@xcite of interesting optical phenomena that result from the interaction between the geometrical resonance associated with light diffraction and the excitation of localized surface - plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles , which play the role of plasmonic nanoantennas.@xcite in addition to the interesting physics revealed in such systems , a number of applications have been proposed , including nanoscale energy transport,@xcite sensing,@xcite and modifying spontaneous emission,@xcite which rely on the improved quality factor resulting from the reduction in radiative damping of the array as compared to localized plasmons excited in isolated particles .",
    "recent advances in the control of the angular emission from quantum dots are also based on diffractive coupling of antenna elements.@xcite    two - dimensional arrays of nanoantennas can be produced with good fabrication control by techniques such as electron - beam lithography,@xcite contact printing,@xcite and colloidal chemistry.@xcite these samples are most commonly manufactured on a substrate of high refractive index compared to the upper medium ( typically air , or water for biosensing applications ) .",
    "it has been suggested from experimental data@xcite and theoretical modeling@xcite that such an asymmetric configuration is incompatible with the existence of delocalized surface modes , and therefore prevents the observation of efficient narrowing of the localized surface - plasmon lineshapes .",
    "this is in contrast to other studies of fluorescence in particle arrays.@xcite    here , we elucidate the conditions under which strong diffractive coupling may occur in the asymmetric configuration . in particular , we examine the reflectivity of gold nanoantenna arrays in close proximity to a substrate .",
    "a sharp transition is observed when varying the particle size above a certain threshold , leading to the sudden emergence of lattice resonances , and establishing a clear difference in the behavior of lithographically patterned nanoantenna arrays depending on the thickness of the metal layer .",
    "likewise , we find the refractive - index contrast and the array - substrate separation to be critical parameters .",
    "the system under study is schematically depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic]a .",
    "it consists of an infinite square array of gold spheres placed in water close to a glass substrate and illuminated under normal incidence . for the particle dimensions under consideration , the optical response of each individual sphere",
    "shows a characteristic dipole plasmon resonance , as shown in fig .",
    "1b for two different host materials .",
    "the interaction between the particles in the array leads to additional , sharper features that correlate with the diffracted orders of the lattice , as shown for some specific geometrical parameters in fig .",
    "in particular , for a homogeneous environment , the ` < 0,1 > ` diffraction feature occurs when the wavelength in the medium is close to the period , @xmath0 .",
    "this condition is obviously dependent on the refractive index @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1c , blue and green curves ) .",
    "strikingly , the diffraction feature disappears when the array is placed in an asymmetric environment , close to an interface ( fig .  1c , red curve ) .",
    "interestingly , the reflectance maximum associated with the dipolar plasmon shifts to the blue in this configuration as a result of interference between light scattered from the particles and the wave reflected at the planar interface ( the specularly reflected beam at the planar interface interferes with the beam scattered from the spheres , which undergoes large phase shifts as the wavelength sweeps across the plasmon resonance , thus distorting the lineshape , unlike what happens in non - specular reflectance , for which such interference is not present ) .",
    "we set out to explain the origin of the suppression of diffraction close to the interface .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "1c are obtained from rigorous multiple - scattering numerical solution of maxwell s equations,@xcite with the gold described by a tabulated measured dielectric function@xcite and the rest of the materials having wavelength - independent refractive index . however",
    ", this method of solution does not provide insight into the origin of the effect , which we explore next using a simple analytical model that allows us to determine the most relevant parameters involved in the phenomenon of inhibition of collective resonances in the arrays .",
    "a variety of semi - analytical and numerical techniques have been developed in this context.@xcite for the geometrical parameters under consideration , it is reasonable to represent the particles as induced point dipoles , for which we obtain the polarizability @xmath2 from the first mie coefficient.@xcite    in the array , the dipole moment @xmath3 at each particle site @xmath4 satisfies the self - consistent coupled - dipoles equation @xmath5 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the external electric field and the sum gives the field induced by other particles @xmath7 at the lattice position @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is a green tensor that yields the electric field produced by a dipole in the surrounding homogeneous medium of refractive - index @xmath10 and light wave vector @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the free - space wave vector .    when the wavelength in the medium @xmath13 is commensurate with the period of the array @xmath14 , scattering of the incident light by the array produces diffracted beams .",
    "only some of these beams are propagating , but the remaining evanescent waves play an important role . for wavelengths above the ` < 0,1 > ` threshold in the spectra of fig .",
    "1c , only the specular beam is propagating , but four additional beams @xmath15 become propagating at shorter wavelengths .",
    "these beams are evanescent above the offset wavelength for diffraction , but in the presence of a substrate they may undergo multiple reflections in the cavity formed between the array and the interface , thereby contributing to the reflectivity of the combined system . thus our approach is to model the inhomogeneous environment using a green tensor based upon the homogeneous environment and to add the effect of the substrate through ( multiple ) reflections from the substrate .    the influence of the substrate on the beams is further illustrated in fig .  2a , which presents dispersion diagrams in the form of reflectance as a function of the total and parallel light wave vectors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "it should be noted that diffraction originates in long - distance interaction between particles , which are polarized along the direction of the external field , @xmath25 .",
    "now , the dipolar field dies off faster than @xmath26 with the distance along @xmath25 , and therefore , the @xmath27 beams are not expected to play a significant role .",

    "multi - layered substrates can be straight - forwardly included in this analysis by introducing a suitable reflection coefficient . in particular , the case of substrates supporting surface modes may introduce new spectral features  @xcite ; this is however beyond the scope of our present study .",

    "first , the coefficients @xmath51 contain a factor of the form @xmath64 , which is responsible for the lattice resonance in a self - standing array near the diffraction edge .",
    "second , the reflectivity coefficient @xmath65 for the grazing diffractive orders has a factor @xmath66 , which diverges right at the diffraction edge .",
    "it is precisely the interplay between the divergent terms in the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r11 ] ) that is responsible for the cancellation of the diffractive coupling in an asymmetric configuration .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2c , in which we assess the accuracy of this model in describing the optical properties of an array of small gold spheres near a substrate .",
    "the reflectance predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : r11 ] ) ( broken curves ) is compared to a rigorous calculation based upon a multiple - scattering formalism described elsewhere@xcite ( solid curves ) .",
    "the results from the analytical model are nearly identical to those of the full calculation near the ` < 0,1 > ` diffraction edge , and both predict a featureless spectrum in that region .",
    "in contrast , a simplified version of the model accounting for only the specular beam [ dotted curve ; eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) reduces to a scalar equation for the zero - order beam ] shows a pronounced ` < 0,1 > ` feature .",
    "the conclusion is clear : diffracted beams cancel the long - range coupling between particles in the presence of a substrate .",
    "physically , this cancellation occurs because of the interference between the reflected grazing diffracted orders and the direct dipolar coupling in the superstrate medium .",
    "the accuracy of the three - beams model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : r11 ] ) is good near the ` < 0,1 > ` diffraction edge .",
    "however , at shorter wavelengths , and in particular around the ` < 1,1 > ` diffraction edge , both the zero - order beam ( dotted curve ) and three - beams model ( dashed curve ) predict a non - existent spectral peak .",
    "this feature disappears when more beams are incorporated into the analytical model .",
    "incidentally , we have also checked the validity of the dipolar approximation by including higher - order multipoles in the rigorous calculation ( up to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the results are nearly indistinguishable regardless the number of multipoles present in the full calculation , as expected for spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength .    in",

    "[ fig : distance ] we investigate the dependence of the reflectance on the distance between the array and the substrate .",
    "the figure clearly shows the transition between the absence of diffraction when the particles are touching the interface and the sharp diffraction peak obtained at large distances , corresponding to the limit of a homogeneous environment .",
    "as the array - substrate distance is reduced , this mode decreases in strength and begins to red shift for separations below 200 nm .",
    "eventually , the mode disappears and a new , weaker peak is observed at the diffraction condition for the _ substrate _ medium .        a similar transition occurs when the index of the substrate is made to match that of the superstrate . in fig .",
    "4a we show reflectance spectra for a range of index differences .",
    "as the index asymmetry is reduced , the mode strength increases dramatically after the asymmetry is below a threshold value .",
    "this is clearly observed in the evolution of the peak maximum with index contrast ( fig .",
    "the threshold for diffraction inhibition seems to depend on both the period of the array and the size of the particles . in general",
    ", this threshold occurs at larger contrast when the particles are bigger or the period smaller , and the transition is smoother for smaller period .",
    "actually , particles of larger size relative to the period deviate more from the ideal situation of small particles situated close to the interface , thus involving significant phase factors @xmath67 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ] that make the diffraction feature more robust against index contrast .",
    "a less intuitive result is that the array period does not substantially affect the maximum reflectance for a symmetric medium , although the fractional occupancy of the spheres is inversely proportional to the period squared .",
    "this mode is associated with diffraction , and the reflectivity of the system is therefore strongly affected by coherent multiple - scattering , so that a simple geometric scaling rule is no longer applicable . because spheres of increasing radius need to be placed further away from the substrate , the transition of fig .",
