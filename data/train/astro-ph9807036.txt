    "a sunspot penumbra seen in high resolution images reveals a small scale fine structure ( for a review , see muller @xcite ) . at a resolution better than @xmath0 , penumbral grains and radially elongated bright and dark filaments",
    "become visible .",
    "there is some observational evidence that bright filaments consist of a few penumbral grains which are radially aligned ( muller @xcite ; soltau @xcite ) .",
    "penumbral grains exhibit proper motions and migrate inwards , i.e. toward the umbra , with apparent velocities of 300500 m  s@xmath1 ( muller @xcite ) .",
    "muller describes penumbral grains as comet - like structures , having a bright coma and a somewhat dimmer tail , which is always directed radially outwards , i.e. away from sunspot center ( see also fig .  2 in tritschler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) .",
    "he states that penumbral grains have a diameter of @xmath2 . however , this value is close to the spatial resolution limit that was achieved in his observations .",
    "doerth & schmidt ( @xcite ) find on the basis of a statistical analysis of penumbral fine structure , that bright and dark filaments have to be smaller than @xmath3 . using the 1.5 m macmath telescope , stachnik et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find spatial scales of @xmath4 within the penumbra .",
    "these results rely on power spectra which were obtained using speckle interferometry .",
    "thus , since the spatial dimensions of bright and dark filaments are uncertain , it is impossible to assign reliable values for corrected photospheric intensities and effective temperatures of the penumbral fine structure .",
    "a still not fully understood penumbral phenomenon was discovered by evershed ( @xcite ) : photospheric absorption lines show a shift of the line core that turns out to be related to a line asymmetry when dark penumbral structures are observed ( beckers & schrter @xcite ; wiehr & degenhardt @xcite ) . in recent years evidence",
    "has accumulated that the evershed effect must be due to a magnetized plasma flow ( solanki et al .",
    "@xcite ) occurring in thin elevated horizontal channels containing outward flows ( rimmele @xcite ) .",
    "the observed asymmetry of the intensity profile can then be explained as the superposition of an unresolved doppler shifted component and an unshifted main component .",
    "here it is assumed that an individual flow channel can not be spatially resolved as suggested by many observers ( bumba @xcite ; holmes @xcite ; schrter @xcite ; stellmacher & wiehr @xcite ; wiehr @xcite ; balthasar et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the siphon flow mechanism has been proposed to explain the evershed effect by meyer & schmidt ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was studied numerically for stationary flux tubes , which arch from the inner penumbra to the outer penumbral boundary , by numerous authors ( e.g. , thomas @xcite ; degenhardt @xcite ; thomas & montesinos @xcite ) .",
    "hitherto , the stationary siphon flow model is the most broadly accepted explanation for the evershed effect . for these models",
    "it is essential to assume strong magnetic flux concentrations of opposite polarity near the outer edge of the penumbra that can create a gas pressure gradient along the arched flux tube in order to accelerate the plasma . here , we want to present for the first time a dynamical model in which the plasma is accelerated locally in the penumbra . in our model , the gas pressure gradient that accelerates the flow is naturally caused by the evolution of the flux tube .",
    "the subphotospheric structure of sunspot penumbrae can not be observed directly .",
    "it is deduced by means of numerical models for the overall structure of a spot ( see the review of jahn @xcite ) ; models with characteristics at the surface which are concurrent with observations yield some information about the spot s properties in deeper layers ( e.g. , jahn @xcite ; jahn & schmidt @xcite ) . both models and observations of the magnetic field strength and its inclination within the penumbra ( e.g. , beckers & schrter @xcite ; schmidt et al . @xcite ; title et al . @xcite ; lites et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that the penumbra can not be a surface phenomenon .",
    "instead , it has to be deep ( schmidt @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the averaged photospheric heat flux of the penumbra , @xmath5 , is significantly higher than the corresponding umbral heat flux , @xmath6 .",
    "jahn & schmidt ( @xcite , hereafter js ) proposed a concept of interchange convection of magnetic flux tubes to account for the surplus brightness of the penumbra .",
    "inspired by observations of bright and dark filaments they conjectured that the magnetic field within the penumbra consists of an ensemble of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "they surmised that inclined magnetic flux tubes evolve dynamically within the penumbra and are able to transport heat more efficiently than magnetoconvection in the umbra which contains an almost vertical magnetic field .",
    "the onset of interchange convection should depend on the slope of the magnetic field lines : imagine a perturbation acting on a bundle of magnetic field lines being in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "since the component of the buoyancy forces acting perpendicular to the tube increases as the flux tube becomes more horizontal , there may exist an angle for which buoyancy forces perpendicular to the tube resulting from a perturbation overcome restoring magnetic forces",
    ". then interchange convection of magnetic flux tubes sets in ( see also rucklidge et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    js constructed the tripartite model for a sunspot which describes self - consistently the three stratifications corresponding to the umbra , the penumbra , and the quiet sun .",
    "these three stratifications are in mechanical equilibrium , such that different gas pressures between the adjacent stratifications are balanced by the magnetic pressure .",
    "the corresponding magnetic fields are generated by two current sheets , namely the magnetopause , which separates the quiet sun and the penumbra , and the peripatopause , which separates the penumbra and the umbra .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows a schematic drawing of these current sheets .",
    "all the stratifications are in hydrostatic equilibrium and the heat transport ( with varying efficiency ) is described by means of the mixing length theory . it is assumed that the peripatopause thermally insulates the umbra , whereas heat exchange along the magnetopause is allowed in subphotospheric layers as long as the slope of the magnetopause relative to the vertical exceeds a critical angle of typically 30 , which corresponds to the bottom of the penumbra , @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "since the energy transport is more efficient in the quiet sun stratification than in the penumbra , the latter is heated .",
    "the rate of heating depends on the transmissivity of the magnetopause , which is a free parameter of the model .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitted heat is distributed instantaneously on horizontal planes in the penumbra model .",
    "consequently , as it is adopted for the umbra and the quiet sun , also the penumbral thermal stratification varies only with depth .",
    "thus , the surplus brightness of the penumbra in the model is due to a finite transmissivity of the magnetopause .",
    "the tripartite model of js has been successful in reproducing the observed magnetic flux of the spot , the observed radial variation of the mean magnetic field strength , the observed radii of sunspots , and the wilson depressions of umbra and penumbra .",
    "moreover , interchange convection naturally causes an inhomogeneous penumbra with features that are concurrent with many high resolution observations ( e.g. , schmidt et al . @xcite ; title et al .",
    "@xcite ; lites et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the present investigation was started in order to test quantitatively the concept of interchange convection .",
    "numerical investigation of the dynamics of the whole ensemble of magnetic flux tubes is not possible at present . as the natural first step",
    ", the discussion presented here is devoted to the evolution of a single magnetic flux tube , which is embedded in a tripartite sunspot .",
    "moreover , we assume the flux tube to be _",
    "thin_. the equations that govern the dynamics of a thin magnetic flux tube are described in the next section .",
    "we also describe there briefly the numerical realization of the model .",
    "3 describes the model set - up , i.e. the initial conditions and the boundary conditions , and the resulting evolution of a thin magnetic flux tube . in sect .",
    "4 , we compare the results of numerical simulations with the observed photospheric features of penumbrae , and argue that our model can reproduce the penumbral fine structure and the evershed effect . also , the concept of interchange convection is discussed on the basis of these new results . in the last section",
    "we summarize the results emphasizing the observational signatures that are suggested by our model .",
    "we start by writing down the full 3-dimensional system of equations for ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) ( see , e.g. , priest @xcite ) . in ideal mhd",
    ", the electrical conductivity is assumed to be infinite , leading to frozen - in - magnetic fields . using the substantial ( convective ) derivative ,    @xmath8    and cgs - units ,",
    "the equations for continuity , induction , equation of motion , entropy equation , divergence free magnetic field , and the equation of state read :    @xmath9    here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 have their usual meaning .",
    "@xmath16 denotes entropy per unit mass , @xmath17 the gas constant , @xmath18 the mean molecular weight .",
    "the second term on the right hand side ( rhs ) in eq .  ( [ state ] ) describes the radiation pressure , with @xmath19 being the stefan  boltzmann  constant , and @xmath20 the speed of light . by taking advantage of the _ thin flux tube approximation _",
    "( defouw @xcite ; spruit @xcite , @xcite ; ferriz mas & schssler @xcite ) this 3-dimensional problem can be reduced to a 1-dimensional problem .",
    "doing so , we closely follow the approach of moreno insertis ( @xcite , hereafter mi ) . furthermore , adopting the tripartite model of js as a background , we can describe the dynamics of a thin flux tube evolving in a 2-dimensional plane ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) .      in a thin magnetic flux tube",
    "physical variables vary only along the tube .",
    "thus , the tube constitutes a curve in a plane , and it is appropriate to use a lagrange representation . as the independent variable , we have chosen the integrated mass , @xmath23 , along the tube .",
    "the position of a mass element is specified by the vector : @xmath24 .",
    "then the velocity and tangent vectors are defined as follows :    @xmath25    note , that @xmath26 is identical with the substantial derivative , @xmath27 , of eq.([substantial_derivative ] ) .",
    "the arc length , d@xmath28 , of a mass element , d@xmath23 , is given by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "within the thin flux tube approximation , the magnetic field vector in the tube is always parallel to the tube ,    @xmath31    with the tangent unit vector , @xmath32 . the magnetic flux , @xmath33 , is conserved along the tube , i.e. ,    @xmath34    with @xmath35 being the cross section of the tube . with the help of eqs .

    "[ figure2 ] , and the curvature @xmath41 is defined as    @xmath42    then , using the condition of the instantaneous pressure equilibrium ( eq .",

    "we follow the work of mi ( see also caligari et al .",

    "it is appropriate to decompose the equation of motion into a component parallel to the tube , and a component perpendicular to the tube . for the parallel component , only the first two terms of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) are relevant .",
    "hence ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 denotes the angle between the vertical and the tangent vector , @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the perpendicular component is obtained by multiplying the final form of eq.([pro_senk ] ) with the normal unit vector @xmath51 :    @xmath52    equations ( [ walen ] ) , ( [ dvpara ] ) , and ( [ dvsenk ] ) determine the time evolution of the tangent vector @xmath53 and the velocity @xmath54 . here , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "are obtained by projecting the velocity component according to @xmath57 .",
    "these equations are identical to those derived by mi , except that our tube is embedded in a magnetic background .",
    "therefore , our perpendicular component of the equation of motion contains an additional force ( 3@xmath58 term on rhs of eq.([dvsenk ] ) ) , which results from the fact , that the gradient of the magnetic pressure in the background exerts a force on the tube . in the magneto - hydrostatic background itself",
    "this force is canceled by the magnetic curvature ( 2@xmath59 term on rhs of eq.([dvsenk ] ) ) .",
    "another subtle difference lies in eq.([pressure ] ) : in our case , the external pressure is given by the sum of the background gas pressure and the magnetic pressure of the background .",

    "the chemical composition is assumed according to stix ( @xcite ) : @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "approximately 100 km above the photosphere , a new equilibrium is found for the tube , in which the downward - acting buoyancy force is neutralized by the upward - acting gradient of the background magnetic pressure ( third term of rhs in eq.([dvsenk ] ) ) .",
    "simultaneously , the footpoint of the tube ( i.e. the intersection of the tube with the photosphere at @xmath134 ) , moves radially inwards toward the umbra .      a positive flow velocity along the tube develops as the tube rises .",
    "it reaches a maximum of 14 km  s@xmath1 at the outer edge of the penumbra at later stages of the evolution .",
    "the onset of this longitudinal flow results from an enhanced gas pressure gradient along the tube , which builds up locally at the place where the tube rises into the photosphere . in order to understand this phenomenon",
    ", one has to realize that the tube finds itself ( locally ) in a strongly superadiabatic environment characterized by a very small gas pressure scale height ( of the order of 100 km ) which is much smaller than the scale height of the magnetic pressure ( approximately 3000 km ) .",
    "note also , that below the photosphere the gas pressure dominates the magnetic pressure , i.e. @xmath158 .",
    "the tube stays in total ( gas + magnetic ) pressure equilibrium as it rises ( cf .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) ) and it must expand , because of the decreasing pressure in the background . since the decrease of the total background pressure is dominated by the gas pressure , the magnetic pressure , @xmath159 , inside the tube gets smaller than the background magnetic pressure , @xmath160 . in consequence ,",
    "the gas pressure inside , @xmath12 , must build up relative to the background gas pressure , @xmath136 .",
    "note , that the background gas pressure is constant horizontally within the penumbra .",
    "since the part of the tube lying above the photosphere does not rise , it becomes almost horizontal between the footpoint , at @xmath161 , and the outer edge of the penumbra , at @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath163 . near the outer edge of the penumbra the gas pressure inside the tube does not change , @xmath164 , whereas the gas pressure is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the footpoint , @xmath165 , since there the tube has risen through the strongly superadiabatic region .",
    "the resulting gas pressure gradient accelerates a horizontal outflow along the tube which is accompanied by an upflow in subphotospheric layers .",
    "this upflow is maintained by the superadiabatic background stratification .",
    "the gas pressure gradient in the horizontal part of the tube is sustained by radiative losses which decrease the internal energy ( and the gas pressure ) of the matter flowing along the tube .",
    "the migration of the footpoint is governed by three forces acting perpendicular to the tube ( the gradient of the background magnetic field can be neglected here ) .",
    "first , at the turning point , i.e. slightly above the footpoint , where the tube bends horizontally , magnetic curvature force is positive ( cf .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) and it decelerates the migration of the footpoint .",
    "second , the longitudinal flow exerts a centrifugal force at the turning point .",
    "the centrifugal force term stems from the advection term in eq .",
    "( [ substantial_derivative ] ) , @xmath166 :    @xmath167 the first term gives the inertia force along the tube , and the second term is the centrifugal force , which is the inertia force perpendicular to the tube .",
    "third , the buoyancy being a vertical force that acts perpendicular to the tube dominates the rise as long as the tube is highly inclined with respect to the vertical .",
    "as the time series shows , the inward migration of the footpoint ceases at @xmath168  s. here , the buoyancy becomes negligible , because of the almost vertical orientation of the subphotospheric part of the tube .",
    "thus , in later stages of the evolution , the perpendicular component of the equation of motion near the turning point is governed only by the centrifugal and the magnetic curvature forces .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the centrifugal force neutralizes the magnetic curvature force when the flow velocity equals the alfvn velocity .",
    "the time series shows a shock front that develops beyond the outer edge of the penumbra .",
    "it forms at @xmath169 mm after 1800  s and migrates outwards with a velocity of roughly 3 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "while it migrates outwards and upwards , the shock front accelerates and reaches @xmath1706 km  s@xmath1 at the outer ( upper ) boundary . based on simple physical arguments ,",
    "the mere existence of this shock wave can be explained as follows .",
    "assume you have a stationary flow upwards along the tube . due to continuity",
    ", the flow velocity , @xmath171 , would then increase according to @xmath172 , whereas the alfvn velocity @xmath173 scales as @xmath174 .",
    "now , @xmath10 decreases exponentially and , not so important , b decreases linearly with height .",
    "thus , @xmath171 being smaller than @xmath173 at some initial height , increases more rapidly than @xmath173 .",
    "at some point , @xmath171 has to become superalfvnic . in a magnetic flux tube",
    "the critical flow velocity along the tube is given by the tube speed , @xmath175 ( e.g. , ferriz mas @xcite ) , implying that a superalfvnic flow is supercritical at the same time . having a supercritical flow that collides with plasma which is at rest initially has to result in a shock front .",
    "as this shock - front accelerates the plasma , it migrates outwards and leaves the computational domain after 4200  s.    in the present contribution we do not make any attempt to realistically describe shock waves .",
    "but it is clear that the shock does not influence the dynamics happening near the penumbral photosphere for several reasons .",
    "first , the shock front is a _ consequence _ of the acceleration of plasma within the penumbra , rather than the cause of the longitudinal flow .",
    "second , the density decreases exponentially with height , and therefore the inertia within the photospheric penumbra is much to large to be affected by the dynamics happening hundreds of kilometers above the photosphere . and after all ,",
    "the flow velocity upstream of the shock is supercritical , i.e. , the penumbral photosphere does nt know about the shock front .",
    "the flow is decelerated within the shock and the gas pressure increases there .",
    "that leads to a local expansion of the tube at the shock front .",
    "such an expansion should be counteracted by magnetic tension forces inside the tube . however , within the thin flux tube approximation such forces are neglected and nothing prevents the tube from infinite expansion at the shock front .",
    "therefore , we have included the magnetic tension forces inside the tube fictitiously by changing the background pressure , @xmath76 : at the location of expansion we enhance the background pressure",
    ". the stronger the expansion , the larger the background pressure .      as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_surplus ] , plasma within the tube expands as it rises through the convection zone .",
    "thereby , the magnetic field strength , @xmath84 , decreases .",
    "the magnetic field strength of plasma reaching the footpoint is the smaller , the larger is the height difference it traveled through the convection zone .",
    "that implies , that @xmath92 at the footpoint decreases continuously , while the flow velocity stays constant in time at the footpoint .",
    "hence , at some point ( in our simulation at @xmath176  s ) the flow becomes superalfvnic and the centrifugal force exceeds the magnetic tension force at the turning point , i.e. the flow overshoots the turning point .",
    "due to radiative losses in the atmosphere , the plasma that overshoots gets denser and decelerates .",
    "the amplitude of the overshoot gradually increases in time as @xmath177 increases .",
    "once the flux tube dives back into the convectively unstable subphotospheric penumbra , anti - buoyancy drags the tube down , and magnetic tension is too weak to prevent the tube from sinking . fig .",
    "[ abbcrash]b shows a snapshot of the tube in the vicinity of the turning point after 9300 s. the inertia of the upflow at the footpoint prevents the turning point from sinking .",
    "the part of the tube that dives back beneath the photosphere sinks down . since the radii of curvature at the turning point ( @xmath178 mm ) and at @xmath179 mm become very small , the thin flux tube approximation is no longer valid .",
    "for that reason , we stop the simulation here .",
    "* proper motion of the footpoint .",

    "[ snapshot]b shows the optical thickness of the tube . here",
    ", the subphotospheric background is illustrated as an optically thick regime and the atmosphere as an optically thin regime .",
    "for better visibility the diameter of the tube in fig .",
    "[ snapshot ] has been magnified by a factor 6 .",
    "the arrows inside the tube indicate longitudinal flow velocities . just below the footpoint",
    "a velocity of 3 km  s@xmath1 is present , beyond the footpoint the velocity increases to 6 km  s@xmath1 , and at the outer part of the penumbra near @xmath185 mm the flow velocity reaches 13 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the footpoint of the flux tube can be identified with a bright penumbral grain , because the upflow along the tube brings hot plasma to the surface which appears bright against the darker background .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous section , the tube s footpoint migrates from the outer edge of the penumbra inward towards the umbra . in fig.[footpoint ] the data points ( plus signs ) are equally spaced in time ( @xmath180  s ) , illustrating that the footpoint starts off at @xmath182 km with a proper velocity exceeding 2 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "after 1200  s ( 4@xmath186 data point from the right ) the migration of the footpoint decelerates from 1.5 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath187 km  s@xmath1 at @xmath183 s. these values are consistent with the proper motion of penumbral grains observed by muller ( @xcite ) .    at the footpoint , the tube s temperature and gas pressure are higher than the corresponding background values .",
    "as the plasma flows along , the tube loses internal energy by radiation .",
    "thereby it cools and the gas pressure diminishes . at @xmath188 mm it reaches temperature equilibrium with the surroundings . as the gas pressure diminishes , the magnetic field strength increases according to eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) , and flux conservation , eq .",
    "( [ flux_conservation ] ) , implies that the tube s diameter decreases between the footpoint and the point of thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , our model is concurrent with observations from muller ( @xcite , b ) and tritschler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) which show that penumbral grains consist of a bright coma and a somewhat dimmer thinner tail which is radially elongated and points away from the umbra .",
    "our model suggests that bright filaments are the long tails of penumbral grains .",
    "however , for lower spatial resolution , a few radially aligned penumbral grains might also be visible and interpreted as one bright filament .",
    "we want to mention , that the length of the bright tail depends on the amount of magnetic flux of the tube : more magnetic flux implies a larger diameter and thus a larger optical depth , a longer radiative relaxation time ( see eq .",
    "( [ trad ] ) ) , and hence a longer bright tail .      in view of figs .",
    "[ snapshot]a and [ snapshot]b , one can see that the tube is optically thick as long as it is hotter than the surroundings .",
    "this is due to the temperature dependence of the h@xmath189 opacity which is the dominant opacity near the photosphere : @xmath190 .",
    "another important feature was already mentioned in sect .",
    "3.2.2 : the tube is elevated above the photosphere .",
    "that means that bright filaments are optically thick structures overlying a darker background and surrounded by an optically thin atmosphere .",
    "therefore , we propose that dark filaments might not exist _ per se_.",
    "they rather appear as a consequence of spacing between radially elongated bright filaments ( schlichenmaier et al .",
    "this is consistent with the statement of muller ( @xcite , @xcite ) that within the penumbra bright features _",
    "show up _ against a dark background .",
    "our model also offers a consistent explanation for the evershed effect : between the footpoint , at @xmath191  mm , and the outer edge of the penumbra , the matter inside the tube becomes gradually more transparent .",
    "the optical thickness of the tube decreases to @xmath192 ( see fig .",
    "[ snapshot]b ) and a line of sight that crosses the tube reaches optical depth @xmath134 in the photosphere of the model at @xmath157 km , i.e. below the tube . in other words , after the plasma has cooled reaching temperature equilibrium with the surroundings , the tube becomes transparent .",
    "the tube constitutes a flow channel that is elevated approximately 100 km above the photosphere and confines an outward flow reaching velocities up to @xmath193 km  s@xmath1 . in the following",
    "we discuss the influence of such a flow channel on the line profiles of photospheric absorption lines .",
    "generally speaking , a flow channel doppler - shifts a line profile that is formed inside the flow channel . in order to understand the line asymmetry which is a characteristic feature of the evershed effect , one should recall that the contribution function of the line core has its maximum higher up in the atmosphere than the contribution function of the line wing , as it is depicted for a typical photospheric absorption line in fig .",
    "[ lowflowchannel ] .",
    "since the flow channel might be substantially thinner than the width of the corresponding contribution function , only distinct parts of a line profile might be shifted .",
    "therefore , a line asymmetry would be caused naturally by a thin flow channel . a line asymmetry which is such that the line wing is more shifted than the line core ( see fig . 1b of degenhardt @xcite )",
    "can be explained by a flow channel that is sufficiently thin and is elevated only slightly above the photosphere ( schlichenmaier et al .",
    "@xcite ) : such a flow channel affects the contribution function of the line wing , but does not influence the contribution function of the line core which originates in still higher layers .    the diameter of the tube in our simulations is less than 50 km , depending on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this has to be taken into account , when shifted asymmetric line profiles are interpreted in order to deduce a flow velocity .",
    "wiehr ( @xcite ) deduces a flow velocity of @xmath194 5 km  s@xmath1 by assuming that the line asymmetry is caused by a spatially unresolved line satellite being caused by a flow channel .",
    "if one further takes into account , that a typical contribution function has a full width at half maximum of more than 100 km and that our simulated tube has a diameter of less than @xmath195 km , a local flow velocity exceeding 10 km  s@xmath1 may still be consistent with observation .",
    "in the preceding section we have demonstrated that the outward flow in the transparent cooler part of the tube can reproduce a line profile that is shifted and asymmetric .",
    "however , our model also predicts an outward flow in optically thick bright filaments .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , since it is observed that the evershed flow is correlated with dark filaments ( e.g. , beckers & schrter @xcite ; title et al .",
    "@xcite ; wiehr & degenhardt @xcite ) and that bright filaments are anti - correlated with the evershed flow ( shine et al .",
    "we explain this apparent contradiction by the fact that all these measurements were done using fei lines that have a low excitation potential of less than 4 ev .",
    "since these lines originate almost exclusively at atmospheric temperatures of , say , less than 6000 k , we expect that a hot , optically thick flow channel has a negligible contribution to the intensity profile of these lines .",
    "if anything , a hot flow channel would at most shift the line wing , where the line intensity is close to the continuum intensity .",
    "hence , a hot flow channel may not be detectable with absorption lines of low excitation potential .",
    "on the other hand , absorption lines which are sensitive to high temperatures , i.e. lines which have a higher excitation potential , are expected to originate mainly within a hot flow channel .",
    "hence , observing bright filaments , i.e. hot plasma , it is more appropriate to use a `` hot '' absorption line with a high excitation potential , such as the ci538.03 nm line .",
    "since this line has an excitation potential of 7.68 ev , its mere existence within the penumbra indicates that hot plasma is present .",
    "in fact , high resolution measurements in the ci538.03 nm line demonstrate the existence of this line within the penumbra and furthermore , they show line core shifts ( rimmele @xcite , stanchfield et al .",
    "@xcite ) . fig .",
    "5 in stanchfield et al . shows line core shifts corresponding to doppler velocities up to 2kms@xmath1 within the penumbra , being blue - shifted on the center side and red - shifted on the limb side .",
    "we take this observation as an indication for the existence of outward flows in bright filaments .",
    "finally , we want to mention that wiehr ( @xcite ) and balthasar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find indications for the existence of a non - zero velocity in bright filaments , if line profiles are interpreted in terms of a largely shifted line satellite that stems from dark filaments and a weakly shifted main component that stems from bright filaments .    in order to decide whether a line shift would be produced by the hot part of our model tube ,",
    "one has to compute synthetic line profiles .",
    "therefore the temperature gradient across the tube is needed , which forms when an optically thick , hot tube radiates in a cooler , optically thin atmosphere .",
    "thus , for computing synthetic line profiles , it is essential to treat the radiative transport for our model tube .    in summary , our model suggests that there are three different structures within a penumbra : a ) a bright component , in which the optically thick and hot flow may only be detectable using `` hot '' absorption lines , b ) a dark component , in which a flow channel of small optical thickness lies above the dark background , and c ) a dark component consisting of the dark background with no flux tube above it . in the last component",
    "one would see a dark filament with no evershed flow present , whereas in case b ) one would look at a dark filament which contains the flow . hence , the evershed signal is correlated with some but not all dark filaments .",
    "we have presented a numerical simulation of the time dependent dynamic evolution of a thin magnetic flux tube inside a sunspot penumbra .",
    "the results yield an extension of the studies reported by jahn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and schlichenmaier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here , we aim at a more detailed understanding of the physical structure of the penumbra .",
    "since our model seems to reproduce the observed small - scale structure of the penumbra , we take this as an indication that it supports the concept of interchange convection , on which our results are based .",
    "the model suggests :    1 .",
    "penumbral grains are the footpoints of inwards migrating flux tubes , in which the enhanced brightness is caused by a systematic upflow . at the footpoint an upflow of 3 km  s@xmath1",
    "is present .",
    "2 .   a bright filament , when interpreted as the dimmer and thinner tail of a penumbral grain , is the consequence of a hot plasma outflow that cools down during horizontal outward motion .",
    "bright filaments are hotter and optically thicker than the surroundings , and are elevated relative to the dark background . in bright filaments",
    "a plasma flow is present having a velocity of typically 6 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the dark background is partly eclipsed by bright filaments .",
    "hence , the appearance of dark filaments would be the result of spacing between bright filaments .",
    "the evershed flow occurs with velocities up to 13 km  s@xmath1 in optically thin ( @xmath196 ) and almost horizontal channels which are elevated some 100 km above the photosphere .    in our model , the magnetic flux tube and",
    "the corresponding plasma flow extends beyond the outer penumbral boundary . at the boundary ,",
    "the tube follows the magnetopause , which slowly gains height and reaches @xmath197 km at @xmath150 mm .",
    "there , the boundary condition allows for a steady outflow of mass .",
    "thus , our model does not describe magnetic flux tubes that dive back beneath the photosphere near the outer edge of the penumbra , as recently reported by westendorp plaza et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and stanchfield et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "modeling dynamical flux tubes that bend back down near the outer edge of the penumbra requires different upper and lower boundary conditions .",
    "instead , our model describes the part of the evershed flow which continues up into the canopy , as it was observed by solanki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we have only considered the rise of a tube that lies along the magnetopause initially . clearly , for an understanding of interchange convection , we need not only study different initial conditions , but also the dynamics of sinking magnetic flux tubes .",
    "if no sinking tubes were present , magnetic flux would be transported continuously from the outer to the inner part of the penumbra . in consequence ,",
    "the magnetic pressure would increase in the inner part of the penumbra .",
    "we surmise that at some point , the gradient of the magnetic pressure , @xmath198 , becomes large enough to suppress the further rise and to initiate the sinking of the flux tube .",
    "we want to stress that the acceleration process that causes the outward flow is related to the siphon flow mechanism ( meyer & schmidt @xcite ) , in the sense that a gas pressure gradient accelerates the plasma .",
    "however , in our model the pressure gradient is created locally within the penumbra : the flow is initiated by the rise of a magnetic flux tube and is driven by the superadiabatic background stratification . in the horizontal part of the tube ,",
    "radiative cooling sustains the gas pressure gradient that accelerates the plasma from 3 km  s@xmath1 near the footpoint up to 14 km  s@xmath1 near the outer edge of the penumbra . in result",
    ", our model does not require strong magnetic fields at the outer footpoint as in the classical siphon flow scenario .",
    "we find an acceleration mechanism that is caused naturally in a certain phase of the evolution of an emerging magnetic flux tube .    since our simulations yield upflows along subphotospheric flux tubes , it is tempting to speculate that the surplus brightness of the penumbra as compared to the umbra is caused by these upflows which constitute a convective heat transport .",
    "thus , one would suppose that penumbral grains and bright filaments which are fed by these upflows cause small fractions of the penumbra to be brighter than the umbra .",
