    "circumnuclear star formation is common in seyfert galaxies , but the relationship between the seyfert nucleus and the surrounding star formation is not well understood ( see filippenko 1992 ) , and both evolutionary and causal relationships have been suggested . for example , a nuclear starburst may develop into a massive star cluster or black hole ( norman & scoville 1988 ) , or conversely the energy output from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may trigger circumnuclear star formation ( sanders & bania 1976 ) .",
    "more recently , studies have indicated that star formation is occurring in and around the torus ( e.g. cid fernandes & terlevich 1992 ; davies 1997 ) that is thought to dictate the type of seyfert nucleus we observe .",
    "dust is a common feature of the circumnuclear environment of active galaxies . at optical wavelengths , it can obscure our view of the nucleus and hide any evidence of an agn . however , radio observations are not only unaffected by dust but also have the advantage of high spatial resolution , and can be important in understanding the role of the various processes in active galaxies .",
    "for example , starburst galaxies generally have diffuse radio morphologies dominated by synchrotron emission from cosmic rays accelerated by supernovae , while seyfert galaxies sometimes exhibit well  collimated radio jets and a compact nuclear radio source ( see review by condon 1992 ) .",
    "high - resolution radio synthesis images , with sub - arcsec resolution , have found compact sources at the nucleus , and extended emission consisting of radio jets , ouflows , diffuse emission , and discrete sources such as hii regions and snrs ( e.g. ulvestad & wilson 1984 ; kronberg 1985 ; antonucci & ulvestad 1988 ; carral , turner & ho 1990 ; condon 1991 ; forbes 1994 ; collison 1994 ; sandqvist 1995 ) .",
    "high spatial resolution , multi  frequency radio observations can also be used to test the idea of advection - dominated accretion flows around black holes . for such flows",
    "the radio emission depends strongly on the mass of the black hole and is characterised by an inverted radio spectrum ( yi & boughn 1997 ) .",
    "here we present 3 and 6 cm radio continuum images from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) of 6 such galaxies which show evidence for narrow high excitation optical forbidden lines , and are classified as seyfert 2s . in the case of ngc 1365",
    ", broad lines have also been detected from the nuclear region .",
    "all six galaxies show evidence for circumnuclear star formation , and several are barred .",
    "we discuss the radio morphologies of these galaxies and possible emission mechanisms , and we compare the radio data with that from other wavelengths to assess the relative contributions to the radio flux from star formation and the agn .",
    "the observations were carried out using the australia telescope compact array at 4.79 ghz ( 6 cm ) and 8.64 ghz ( 3 cm ) simultaneously .",
    "the observational parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "the same amplitude calibrator ( 1934638 ) was observed with each galaxy , with an assumed flux density of 5.83 jy at 6 cm and 2.84 jy at 3 cm .",
    "observations of the target galaxy and a phase calibrator were alternated throughout the observing run , with a total of about 10 hours spent on - source on each galaxy .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated and cleaned using the aips software package . the typical half  power beam ",
    "width ( hpbw ) of the final images are 2 arcsec at 6 cm and 1 arcsec at 3 cm .",
    "because these observations and their analysis were optimised for studying the nuclear region , they are relatively insensitive to extended emission . thus our images are primarily of the nuclear region , and we will therefore not show any smooth extended structure on scales of tens of arcsec .",
    "in figures 1 to 12 we show the 3 and 6 cm radio images for the six galaxies in our sample .",
    "these galaxies do not represent a complete sample in any sense , but rather were chosen as relatively well  known southern seyfert 2 galaxies that generally lacked high resolution radio maps .",
    "our radio data for the circinus galaxy have been presented elsewhere along with near  infrared line imaging ( davies 1997 ) , although we include it here for comparison purposes with the other galaxies .",
    "the images show a variety of radio morphologies which range from circinus , with a strong , compact nucleus , to ngc 1365 , with a extended region of discrete sources or hot - spots .",
    "the beam shape is shown in the lower left of each image .",
    "care is needed when interpreting these images , as ( a ) our observations are optimised for studying the nuclear region , and so our images will not correctly represent the extended diffuse emission from the disk of the galaxy , and ( b ) most of the galaxies have high inclinations so that confusion effects may play some role in the observed radio morphology .",
    "flux measurements in 2 arcsec and 6 arcsec diameter apertures for each galaxy are given in table 2 .",
    "we also list the 6 cm to 3 cm spectral index after smoothing the 3 cm image to match the 6 cm resolution .",
    "the spectral indices ( f @xmath0 ) range from flat ( @xmath1 @xmath2 0 ) to steep ( @xmath1 @xmath2 1 ) .",
    "the total 6 cm flux in table 2 is given both for our images and for the single  dish observations by wright ( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the difference between these indicates the amount of diffuse emission which is missing from our images .",
    "we also calculated the maximum brightness temperatures for each image ( both 3 and 6 cm ) and the maximum value is given for each source .",
    "in table 3 we list various derived quantities for the sample including hubble type , distance , inclination , 6 cm and [ feii ] line luminosities and the sn rate .",
    "the [ feii ] measurements are from moorwood & oliva ( 1988 ) in a 6 arcsec diameter aperture , except for the circinus galaxy in which we use a nuclear [ feii ] flux from davies ( 1997 ) .",
    "none of the [ feii ] fluxes have been corrected for extinction .",
    "the sn rate is calculated separately from both the 6 cm and [ feii ] line flux in the 6 arcsec aperture ( corresponding to @xmath2 500 pc at a typical distance of 20 mpc ) .",
    "the 6 cm sn rate is calculated assuming that all of the 6 cm flux is non  thermal emission from cosmic rays accelerated by snrs ( e.g. condon & yin 1990 ) .",
    "this may give an overestimate of the rate because it ignores any nuclear flux ( which may be significant ) and the contribution from thermal emission ( which is unlikely to be significant ) .",
    "for the [ feii ] sn rate we simply assume an average luminosity of 2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 over an adiabatic lifetime of 2 @xmath3 10@xmath6 yrs ( e.g. norris & forbes 1995 ) .",
    "for most galaxies the two methods give rates within a factor of two , the notable exception being ngc 4945 ( which is discussed further below ) .",
    "the radio spectral index of seyfert and starburst galaxies is determined by four mechanisms .",
    "cosmic rays within the galaxy are generated and re  accelerated by supernovae and supernova remnants , and then interact with the interstellar magnetic field to emit synchrotron emission .",
    "this synchrotron emission , with a typical spectral index of @xmath1 @xmath2 0.7 , is expected to dominate the radio power of starburst galaxies , and should appear as a diffuse component in radio images of these sources .",
    "relativistic particles ejected from the massive black hole at the nucleus of a galaxy may generate intense synchrotron emission , similar to that seen in radio  loud galaxies and quasars .",
    "the cores in these radio - loud objects typically have a flat  spectrum core , indicating synchrotron self  absorption , and steep  spectrum extended radio  lobes , suggesting cooling of high  energy electrons .",
    "however , synchrotron self ",
    "absorption is important only for brightness temperatures greater than 10@xmath7 k ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "most seyfert galaxies , on the other hand , are observed to have much lower brightness temperatures than this in the core , so that synchrotron self - absorption is not significant in these sources .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed core spectral indices , which are frequently in the region of 0.7 .",
    "when the radiative efficiency in the accretion disk is low , an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) may operate . the radio emission in these sources",
    "is dominated by synchrotron emission from a hot plasma , and the emission from such flows is predicted to give rise to inverted spectra with typical indices of + 0.4 ( yi & boughn 1997 ) . the adaf radio emission mechanism has only recently been proposed and should be regarded as untested at this stage .",
    "the data here are unlikely to provide a definitive test because of insufficient resolution , and all radio spectral indices measured here are negative .",
    "we will therefore not consider this mechanism further , except to note that this mechanism would be indicated by inverted - spectrum emission from a low - brightness - temperature core .",
    "no source here falls into this category .",
    "h ii regions in our galaxy generate free  free emission from hot electrons .",
    "most are optically thin , giving a flat spectrum , although some compact h ii regions become optically thick at centimetre wavelengths , giving a spectral index @xmath2 + 2 . however , the integrated flux of such regions is generally insignificant compared to the synchrotron emission of the host galaxy .",
    "\\5 . the radio emission from ultra",
    " luminous infrared galaxies is optically thick to free  free absorption , so that the typical synchrotron spectrum of these galaxies is flattened at low frequencies ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the combined result of these effects in seyfert and starburst galaxies is to produce a typical radio spectral index of 0.7 ( from the extended synchrotron emission ) with a flattening at low frequencies in some starburst sources because of free  free absorption .",
    "table 2 shows that the nuclear spectral indices of three of the galaxies ( ngc 1365 , ngc 6221 , ngc 7582 ) is 0.5 or steeper on both the 2 arcsec and the 6 arcsec scale , showing evidence for neither free  free nor synchrotron absorption . in the other three galaxies ,",
    "the cores have flatter spectra , but the brightness temperatures ( @xmath8 8300 k ) are too low for synchrotron self  absorption , indicating that free  free absorption is responsible for the flattening .    of course , we can not rule out the presence of a weak synchrotron self  absorbed core in the nucleus of any of these galaxies .",
    "however , comparison of the radio fluxes in a 2arcsec aperture with the flux in a 6arcsec aperture in table 2 shows that the luminosity of any such core is small compared to the surrounding emission .",
    "therefore any such core does not contribute significantly to the overall energy budget of the nuclear region of the galaxy , and is not responsible for the overall flat spectrum of the nuclear region ..",
    "this degree of free - free absorption flattening indicates either a high star formation rate ( condon 1991 ) or that we are viewing the agn through optically ",
    "thick narrow - line - region clouds ( roy 1994 ) .",
    "forbes & ward ( 1993 ) discovered that the 6 cm radio emission in the central regions of active galaxies is strongly correlated with the near  infrared [ feii ] 1.64@xmath9 m line emission .",
    "this relation exists over several orders of magnitude . with a larger sample , simpson ( 1996 )",
    "were able to show that seyfert and starburst galaxies follow slightly different radio[feii ] relations .",
    "for starburst galaxies the relation , with slope @xmath2 1 , can be reasonably explained by snrs which are responsible for both the non  thermal radio emission and the fast shocks that provide the [ feii ] excitation .",
    "however , the situation for seyfert galaxies ( which reveal a correlation slope of @xmath2 0.7 ) is less clear .",
    "simpson argued that photo - ionisation from the seyfert nucleus can cause this relationship , with a contribution from radio  jet induced shocks in some cases .    in fig .",
    "13 we show the [ feii]/6 cm ratio for our sample galaxies , compared with the seyfert and starburst relations of simpson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath10 dispersion of galaxies about the relations is @xmath2 @xmath11 . for the seyferts studied here",
    ", we find a large degree of star ",
    "formation activity compared to photo  ionisation from an agn , and so we might expect them to lie closer to the starburst relation than the seyfert one .",
    "this indeed appears to be the case for four galaxies , although one ( ngc 7582 ) is closer to the seyfert relation and ngc 4945 falls well away from either relation .",
    "the [ feii]/6 cm ratio of ngc 4945 is about a factor of 100 lower than typical active galaxies , and we discuss this further in section 3.4 below .",
    "we note however that given the dispersion in the relations , and the low luminosities ( @xmath8 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath5 ) of the galaxies studied here , this is not a sensitive test of the excitation mechanism .      normal spiral and starburst galaxies show a tight correlation between their radio and fir luminosity ( e.g. wunderlich et al .",
    "this correlation , which extends over five orders of magnitude , is true for both flux density and luminosity , and can not be accounted for by selection effects , or by a simple `` richness effect '' . while a detailed mechanism to explain this correlation has yet to be established",
    ", it is almost certainly the result of star formation , which generates both the synchrotron radio emission and the thermal fir emission .",
    "this is supported by the fact that all objects that are dominated by star formation ( hii galaxies , normal spirals , starburst galaxies ) do follow the correlation .",
    "on the other hand , sopp & alexander ( 1991 ) showed that radio  loud quasars and radio galaxies clearly do not follow the radio  fir correlation .",
    "thus whether or not a galaxy follows this correlation may be used as an indicator of the dominant radio luminosity source of the galaxy .",
    "norris ( 1988 ) and roy ( 1997 ) showed that seyfert galaxies , unlike radio  loud quasars , do roughly follow the radio  fir correlation , but with a looser fit than normal spirals and starbursts .",
    "this suggests that the bolometric luminosity of seyfert galaxies may be dominated by star formation .",
    "this is supported by off  nuclear optical and infrared observations of seyferts , which show the same line ratios and luminosities as starburst galaxies ( bransford et al .",
    "thus , although the nuclear optical spectra of seyfert galaxies are clearly dominated by an agn , in many cases the integrated radio emission and the fir emission are dominated not by the agn but by circumnuclear star formation .    the degree to which an individual galaxy follows this correlation is most conveniently expressed by the parameter q  the logarithm of the fir to radio ratio",
    ". the conventional definition of q follows that of helou ( 1985 ) , who define q in terms of the 1.49 ghz radio flux . for our purposes ,",
    "we adapt helou s definition to our observing frequency of 4.8 ghz by assuming a spectral index of 0.7 , and therefore define it as    q @xmath13 log[(fir/3.75 x 10@xmath14 hz)/(2.26 x s@xmath15(1 )    where fir @xmath13 1.26 x 10@xmath16(2.58s@xmath17+s@xmath18)(2 )    typical values of q from the iras bright galaxy sample are 2.34 for normal spirals , 2.21 for starburst galaxies , and less than 2 for radio  loud agns ( condon 1991 ) .",
    "all the galaxies studied here except ngc 4945 have q in the range 2.2 to 2.3 , which places them firmly in the middle of the radio  fir correlation , and suggests that most of their radio and fir luminosity is produced by star formation .",
    "we discuss the case of ngc 4945 ( q = 1.88 ) below .      here",
    "we discuss each galaxy in turn , starting with an extended discussion of ngc 4945 . to avoid repetition",
    ", we note that in every case other than ngc 4945 , the spectral index , radio  fir ratio , and [ feii]radio ratio are all consistent with star formation , rather than an agn , being the dominant source of radio emission .    *",
    "ngc 4945 * this infrared luminous galaxy is nearly edge  on and is located in a nearby loose group . although we list it as a barred galaxy in table 3 , there is a continuing debate about the reality of the bar ( e.g. harnett 1989 ) .",
    "koornneef ( 1993 ) described ngc 4945 as a post  starburst galaxy with no evidence for an agn .",
    "however moorwood & oliva ( 1994 ) have argued that the central regions do show signs of ongoing young star formation .",
    "evidence for a heavily obscured agn now come from the variable hard x  rays ( iwasawa 1993 ) , and the presence of a compact radio core in vlbi observations ( sadler 1995 ) .",
    "the galaxy contains a thick torus or ring with a radius of @xmath2 150 pc ( koornneef 1993 ; moorwood 1996 ) .",
    "harnett ( 1989 ) found that the radio emission has a strong central contribution with emission extended 10 arcmin perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "frequency observations have been carried out by elmouttie ( 1997 ) .",
    "they focused on the large scale structure using a beam size of @xmath2 25@xmath19 , and found that the spectral index steepens from the central region to the main disk of the galaxy .    furthermore , ngc 4945 is notable for the fact that it is one of the few galaxies ( along with circinus ) known to contain water megamasers .",
    "such megamasers have been cited in ngc 4258 ( miyoshi 1995 ) as the strongest evidence known for a massive black hole in an agn .",
    "preliminary vlbi imaging ( greenhill 1997 ) of the megamasers supports the model that they are in a keplerian disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "our radio image is dominated by strong nuclear emission , and emission extended along the disk of the galaxy .",
    "however there is also evidence of some filamentary structure perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "such extended emission may be associated with the outflowing superwind in this galaxy ( nakai 1989 ; lipari , tsvetanov & macchetto 1997 ) .",
    "the extended emission has a steeper spectral index ( @xmath20 ) than the radio nucleus , however we note that our data are less sensitive to extended emission ( particularly at 3 cm ) which makes the spectral index somewhat less certain .",
    "the nucleus has a relatively flat spectral index of @xmath1 = 0.3 .",
    "the brightness temperature in the central 2 arcsec of this source ( i.e. 7000 k ) is still far too low for synchrotron self  absorption , indicating that the star formation activity is particularly intense , to provide the necessary free  free absorption .",
    "the obscuration inferred from the x  ray data suggest that the extinction towards the agn could be as high as a@xmath21 @xmath2 2500 .",
    "we noted above ( in section 3.3 ) that the radio  fir ratio for this galaxy is unusually low ( i.e. q = 1.88 ) , which at first sight appears to suggest that an agn is responsible for much of the radio emission .",
    "however , this galaxy is so near that not all the fir flux was in the single iras aperture , and so the iras flux listed in the iras point source catalog may be an underestimate .",
    "rice ( 1988 ) have estimated the total fir flux by co  adding iras images and obtain a higher value for the fir fluxes , which raises the value of q to 2.1 , suggesting that the radio emission in this galaxy is again dominated by star formation rather than by an agn .",
    "an interesting property of ngc 4945 is that the ratio of the [ feii ] line luminosity to 6 cm radio emission is only 0.63 , which is almost a factor of 100 less than is typical for active galaxies ( see fig .",
    "we now consider a number of possible reasons for this .",
    "* the reduced ratio could be due to extinction ( by dust ) of the [ feii ] . however , moorwood & oliva ( 1994 ) estimate that the extinction in the [ feii ] line emitting zone is 1.8 mag or a factor of five , which is insufficient to produce the observed effect .",
    "* it could be because of nuclear radio emission from an agn which is not accompanied by [ feii ] line emission .",
    "we have shown above that the radio / fir ratio for the galaxy as a whole is consistent with star formation activity .",
    "however , the central 6 arcsec ( over which we measure the [ feii]/6 cm ratio ) contributes only 9% of the total radio flux , and we have no information on the radio / fir ratio in the nucleus , so the radio flux from the agn could be abnormally large . in this case , we would expect the [ feii]/6 cm ratio to approach the usual value as we increase the area over which we integrate the flux ( for both 6 cm and [ feii ] ) .",
    "however , moorwood & oliva ( 1994 ) quote a total [ feii ] flux over an emitting region of 18 @xmath3 21 arcsec to be 12 @xmath3 10@xmath16 erg s@xmath5 @xmath22 , or an observed log luminosity of 38.81 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the 6 cm radio luminosity over a similar area is 40.21 erg s@xmath5 , giving a [ feii]/6 cm ratio of 0.03 , which is even lower than the value in the nucleus , indicating that the [ feii]/6 cm ratio falls off with distance from the galaxy centre , and that the low value is not a consequence of nuclear radio emission .",
    "thus the abnormally low [ feii]/6 cm ratio in ngc 4945 of 0.63 is produced in the region surrounding the nucleus , where the radio emission ( with a spectral index of @xmath2 0.7 ) is due to snrs in the galaxy disk , the outflowing starburst superwind discussed above , or perhaps a radio jet .",
    "pure snrs produce ratios of about 500 i.e. well in excess of typical galaxy values , so this would tend to give an enhanced ratio . in a @xmath23 aperture , the superwind galaxies m82 and ngc 253 have [ feii]/6 cm ratios of 75 and 52 respectively , although the superwind itself in ngc 253 does not seem to produce significant [ feii ] line emission ( forbes 1993 ) . again",
    "such ratios are significantly higher than seen in ngc 4945 .",
    "the data for seyfert galaxies with clear radio jets are limited . for ngc 4151 and ngc 1068",
    "the measured ratios are 28 and 9 .",
    "this is closer to the ngc 4945 value but still a factor of at least 10 too high .",
    "we conclude that the abnormal [ feii]/6 cm ratio in ngc 4945 is due to either ( a ) a starburst superwind , which produces substantial radio emission but very little [ feii ] line flux ( due perhaps to an unknown excitation effect or low density in the wind ) , or ( b ) a radio jet which dominates the extended radio emission on the few  arcsec scale but which does not produce significant [ feii ] emission .",
    "* ngc 1365 * this is a well  studied barred galaxy .",
    "the central region reveals broad and narrow emission lines ( veron 1980 ) surrounded by a circumnuclear ring of star formation ( edmunds & pagel 1982 ; saikia 1994 ) . the star formation , combined with the obscuring effects of dust ,",

    "a high excitation outflow from the nucleus has been seen ( e.g. hjelm & lindblad 1996 ) .",

    "jorsater & lindblad ( 1995 ) observed it with the vla at 20 , 6 , and 2 cm .",
    "their radio images revealed a weak nucleus surrounded by a elongated @xmath2 8 @xmath3 20 arcsec ( a / b = 0.4 ) ring of hot - spots , or components .",

    "<S> we have produced radio maps , using the atca , of the central regions of six southern seyfert 2 galaxies ( ngc 1365 , 4945 , 6221 , 6810 , 7582 , and circinus ) with circumnuclear star formation , to estimate the relative contribution of star formation activity compared to activity from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radio morphologies range from extended diffuse structures to compact nuclear emission , with no evidence , even in the relatively compact sources , for synchrotron self  absorption . in each case </S>",
    "<S> the radio to far  infrared ( fir ) ratio has a value consistent with star formation , and in all but one case the radio to [ feii ] ratio is also consistent with star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive supernova rates and conclude that , despite the presence of a seyfert nucleus in these galaxies , the radio , fir , and [ feii ] line emission are dominated by processes associated with the circumnuclear star formation ( i.e. supernova remnants and h  ii regions ) rather than with the agn . </S>"
