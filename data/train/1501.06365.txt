    "in many applications , in particular in the pricing of financial securities , we are interested in the effective computation by monte carlo methods of the quantity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a diffusion process and @xmath2 a  given function .",
    "the monte carlo euler method consists of two steps .",
    "first , approximate the diffusion process @xmath3 by the euler scheme @xmath4 with time step @xmath5 . then approximate @xmath6 by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a sample of @xmath9 independent copies of @xmath10 .",
    "this approximation is affected , respectively , by a discretization error and a statistical error @xmath11 on one hand , talay and tubaro @xcite prove that if @xmath2 is sufficiently smooth , then @xmath12 with @xmath13 a given constant and in a more general context , kebaier @xcite proves that the rate of convergence of the discretization error @xmath14 can be @xmath15 for all values of @xmath16 $ ] ( see , e.g. , kloeden and platen @xcite for more details on discretization schemes ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistical error is controlled by the central limit theorem with order @xmath17 .",
    "further , the optimal choice of the sample size @xmath9 in the classical monte carlo method mainly depends on the order of the discretization error .",
    "more precisely , it turns out that for @xmath18 the optimal choice of @xmath9 is @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to a total complexity in the monte carlo method of order @xmath20 ( see duffie and glynn @xcite for related results ) .",
    "let us recall that the complexity of an algorithm is proportional to the maximum number of basic computations performed by this one .",
    "hence , expressing this complexity in terms of the discretization error @xmath14 , we get @xmath21 .    in order to improve the performance of this method ,",
    "kebaier introduced a two - level monte carlo method @xcite ( called the statistical romberg method ) reducing the complexity @xmath22 while maintaining the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "this method uses two euler schemes with time steps @xmath5 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and approximates @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a second euler scheme with time step @xmath23 and such that the brownian paths used for @xmath28 and @xmath29 has to be independent of the brownian paths used to simulate @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out that for a given discretization error @xmath31 ( @xmath16 $ ] ) , the optimal choice is obtained for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . with this choice ,",
    "the complexity of the statistical romberg method is of order @xmath35 , which is lower than the classical complexity in the monte carlo method .",
    "more recently , giles @xcite generalized the statistical romberg method of kebaier @xcite and proposed the multilevel monte carlo algorithm , in a similar approach to heinrich s multilevel method for parametric integration @xcite ( see also creutzig et  al .",

    "the multilevel monte carlo method uses information from a sequence of computations with decreasing step sizes and approximates the quantity @xmath36 by @xmath37 where the fine discretization step is equal to @xmath5 thereby @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , processes @xmath40 , @xmath41 , are independent copies of @xmath42 whose components denote the euler schemes with time steps @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath45 , the simulation of @xmath46 and @xmath47 has to be based on the same brownian path .",
    "concerning the first empirical mean , processes @xmath48 , @xmath49 , are independent copies of @xmath50 which denotes the euler scheme with time step  @xmath51 . here , it is important to point out that all these @xmath52 monte carlo estimators have to be based on different independent samples . due to the above independence assumption on the paths , the variance of the multilevel estimator is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "assuming that the diffusion coefficients of @xmath55 and the function @xmath56 are lipschitz continuous , then it is easy to check , using properties of the euler scheme that @xmath57 for some positive constant @xmath58 ( see proposition [ p1 ] for more details ) .",
    "giles @xcite uses this computation in order to find the optimal choice of the multilevel monte carlo parameters .",
    "more precisely , to obtain a desired root mean squared error ( rmse ) , say of order @xmath15 , for the multilevel estimator , giles @xcite uses the above computation on @xmath59 to minimize the total complexity of the algorithm .",
    "it turns out that the optimal choice is obtained for ( see theorem  3.1 of @xcite ) @xmath60 hence , for an error @xmath18 , this optimal choice leads to a complexity for the multilevel monte carlo euler method proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "interesting numerical tests , comparing three methods ( crude monte carlo , statistical romberg and the multilevel monte carlo ) , were processed in korn , korn and kroisandt @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on central limit theorems for the inferred error ; a question which has not been addressed in previous research .",
    "to do so , we use techniques adapted to this setting , based on a central limit theorem for triangular array ( see theorem [ lindeberg ] ) together with toeplitz lemma .",
    "it is worth to note that our approach improves techniques developed by kebaier @xcite in his study of the statistical romberg method ( see remark [ rem - keb ] for more details ) .",
    "hence , our main result is a lindeberg ",
    "feller central limit theorem for the multilevel monte carlo euler algorithm ( see theorem [ cltsr ] ) .",
    "further , this allows us to prove a berry  esseen - type bound on our central limit theorem .    in order to show this central limit theorem",
    ", we first prove a stable law convergence theorem , for the euler scheme error on two consecutive levels @xmath62  and  @xmath63 , of the type obtained in jacod and protter @xcite .",
    "indeed , we prove the following functional result ( see theorem [ th - acc ] ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the same limit process given in theorem 3.2 of jacod and protter @xcite .",
    "our result uses standard tools developed in their paper but it can not be deduced without a specific and laborious study .",
    "further , their result , namely @xmath66 is neither sufficient nor appropriate to prove our theorem [ cltsr ] , since the multilevel monte carlo euler method involves the error process @xmath67 rather than @xmath68 .",
    "thanks to theorem [ cltsr ] , we obtain a precise description for the choice of the parameters to run the multilevel monte carlo euler method . afterward , by a complexity analysis we obtain the optimal choice for the multilevel monte carlo euler method .",
    "it turns out that for a total error of order @xmath18 the optimal parameters are given by @xmath69 this leads us to a complexity proportional to @xmath70 which is the same order obtained by giles @xcite . by comparing relations ( [ gilesparam ] ) and ( [ bakparam ] )",
    ", we note that our optimal sequence of sample sizes @xmath71 does not depend on any given constant , since our approach is based on proving a central limit theorem and not on obtaining an upper bound for the variance of the algorithm .",
    "however , some numerical tests comparing the runtime with respect to the root mean square error , show that we are in line with the original work of giles @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the major advantage of our central limit theorem is that it fills the gap in the literature for the multilevel monte carlo euler method and allows to construct a more accurate confidence interval compared to the one obtained using chebyshev s inequality .",
