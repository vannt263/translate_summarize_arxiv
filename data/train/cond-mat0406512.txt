    "we get shot noise as the second cumulant , proper part of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) as the third one , etc .",
    "thus the current cumulants and moments are connected in a different way than e. g. those ones of conductivity .",
    "the moments @xmath10 themselves become usually either zero ( insulator ) or infinite ( metal ) in the large system limit , except criticality .",
    "but we will show , that both their ratios and appropriately chosen linear combinations will have non - trivial finite values .",
    "the limiting @xmath8 ratios have the pleasant property that they are independent of boundary conditions .",

    "q1d means quasi-1d systems , i. e. stripes of fixed , but large enough width and even much larger length .",
    "we continue in 2d and 3d with larger systems and statistics , and we add both @xmath32 and higher current moments @xmath33 . under simple assumptions on the distribution function of lyapunov exponents ,",
    "one gets the limiting values for @xmath8 both in diffusive and critical ( 3d ) regimes .",
    "we will also confirm the validity of nazarov s theory @xcite in diffusive case for higher moments and in @xmath32 ; for @xmath34 and @xmath35 it was already shown in @xcite and @xcite , though less precisely because of smaller system sizes and thus larger disturbing ballistic effects .",
    "there is a great amount of literature on shot noise , e. g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the poissonian value @xmath36 corresponds to the strongly localized ( insulating ) regime , the well known 1/3 suppression @xmath37 is typical for the metallic regime . if @xmath9 we get yet another value @xmath38 , which marks the mit .",
    "all higher moments will show qualitatively the same behaviour .    in recent paper @xcite",
    "even the fourth cumulant , or the combination @xmath39 was introduced .",
    "such quantities can be calculated in general .",
    "the aim of this work is to show that @xmath8 and special linear combinations of @xmath10 converge to universal values in the large system size limits ; to observe two non - trivial limiting @xmath8 values for @xmath9 ; to give them analytically ( except 4d criticality ) and to prove them numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in this intro and in section 2.1",
    "we recall some results from papers , treating higher current moments or cummulants , especially in metallic regime , and the first steps towards 3d criticality .",
    "then we add theoretical predictions for any normalized moment and cummulant at 3d mit . in the next section 2.2",
    "we briefly introduce nazarov s microscopic model , yielding even more information about the moments in metallic regime . in section 3",
    "we confirm virtually any given analytical formula for current moments and cummulants by numerical simulations ( except 1d and q1d ) .",
