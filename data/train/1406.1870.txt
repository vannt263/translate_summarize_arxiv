    "while south africa has been celebrated as having the most enabling constitution in the protection and advancement of african languages and has had a stable democracy for two decades , there is a glaring limitation in the investment in computational linguistics and human language technologies ( hlt ) .",
    "although the imperative in hlt exist , there has been a lack of coordination in the development of hlt in african languages and a total lack of commitment from government and related institutions to invest and advance hlts . however , the need for them is voiced ; e.g. , the `` national recordal system '' project by the national indigenous knowledge systems office ( nikso ) of the south african department of science and technology , and the university of kwazulu - natal , which recently made a ground - breaking introduction of mandatory isizulu module for all its students , and is driving the development of scientific terminology in isizulu .",
    "visible advances are those that have been made by large companies such as google and microsoft , which have seen the localization of the user interfaces of their software , and an error - full google translate english - isizulu . these and related endeavours require natural language generation and machine translation , and multilingualism in knowledge representation ( e.g. , @xcite ) with end - user and domain expert interfaces , which do not exist .",
    "multilingual systems are being developed elsewhere ( among many , @xcite ) , and there are larger projects , such as monnet ( http://www.monnet-project.eu ) for foundational aspects and organic.lingua ( http://www.organic-lingua.eu ) as applied project . as it appeared during our investigation , these advances are not immediately applicable with nguni languages . starting from the base and defining a grammar alike described in @xcite , is a rather daunting task , because the still important reference for linguistic work for isizulu and southern bantu languages are old and outdated @xcite and it will take many years to update . in the meantime , it is prudent to commence with the basics of nlg in such a way to serve linguists , computer scientists , and domain experts to show relevance . to this end",
    ", we take common language constructs of a practical logic language , such as the owl 2 el profile @xcite that is also used for the snomed ct medical terminology , as a starting point to focus on cnl and verbalizations of logical theories . concerning verbalizations for owl ontologies",
    ", it is already known that there are variations for verbalizations within english @xcite and good english - owl systems exist , notably ace @xcite and swat @xcite .",
    "the main results for logic - based conceptual models have been obtained also for monolingual english verbalizations @xcite , whereas limitations of the so - called template - based approach have been investigated for the multilingual setting @xcite .",
    "overall , this raises several questions : 1 ) what are the verbalization patterns for isizulu for the basic constructs ?",
    "2 ) what does that entail for an implementation of a verbalization ? 3 ) are there theoretical options one can choose from , like in other languages , and which ones are preferred among isizulu speakers",
    "? we devised the high - level patterns for verbalization of subsumption , disjointness , existential and universal quantification , and conjunction .",
    "the grammar rules for isizulu are complex to the extent that a template - based approach is not feasible for either of the constructs investigated .",
    "this is due to , mainly , the semantics of the noun that affects several other components in a sentence , and the highly agglutinative nature of isizulu .",
    "this also means existing multilingual and verbalization models and infrastructures can not be transposed and translated to the nguni languages .",
    "there are verbalization options , and we have conducted a survey to elicit both linguist and non - linguist preferences to inform algorithm development for a nlg - focussed grammar engine .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : zuluintro ] describes some basic aspects of isizulu and section  [ sec : main ] summarizes the results of the verbalization patterns .",
    "the user evaluation is presented in section  [ sec : eval ] .",
    "we discuss in section  [ sec : disc ] and conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "isizulu is the most populous language in south africa spoken as a first ( home ) language by about 23% of the over 50 million population .",
    "it has been documented for over a hundred and seventy years with the first booklet _ incwadi yokuqala yabafundayo _ having been produced in 1837 .",
    "it is a bantu language that belongs to the nguni sub - group of languages comprising of isixhosa , isindebele , siswati and isizulu .",
    "bantu languages have characteristically agglutinating morphology , which makes them rich and complex in their structure and one of the salient features of isizulu is the system of noun classes .",
    "each noun in isizulu belongs to a noun class .",
    "it is the noun class that controls the concordance of all words in a sentence whose structure is typically subject verb object ( svo ) , although variations are attested to exist .",
    "the isizulu noun class prefixes , based on meinhoff ( 1948 ) , are mostly coupled in terms of singular / plural , and the classes are listed in table  [ tab : nouns ] .    the noun comprises of two formatives , the prefix and the stem ; its structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : classtree ] . prefixes express number and indicate the class to which a particular noun belongs .",
    "a prefix can be characterized as full or incomplete .",
    "the full prefix has the augment ( pre - prefix ) followed by a prefix proper and an incomplete prefix only has the augment respectively illustrated as",
    "_ i_@xmath0 _ mi_@xmath1 _",
    "fula_@xmath2 ( _ imifula _ = rivers ) and _ o_@xmath0 _ gogo_@xmath2 ( _ ogogo _ = grandmothers ) .",
    "because of the agglutinating nature of isizulu , a number of prefixes are phonologically conditioned and yet others are homographs . as stated earlier , the morphology of the head noun in the subject position will then influence the agreement pattern as shown in following the example .",
    "amantombazana amadala adlala ibhola elimhlophe    * ama*-ntombazana * ama*-dala * a*-dlal - a bhola -mhlophe    * 6.*-girls big -play * 5.*-ball * rel-5*.-white    ` the big girls are playing with the white ball '    the abbreviations by convention refer , respectively , to subj = subject , rel = relative and 6./5 .",
    "= noun class 6 and 5 respectively .",
    "the complex agreement system presents interesting challenges in the development of computational technologies in isizulu .",
    "the understanding of the basic morphological structure of isizulu is crucial in the formulation of the technologies .        .zulu",
    "noun classes , with examples .",
    "the noun class prefix of classes 1 and 3 is conditioned by the morphology of the stem to which it attaches : _",
    "-mu- _ before monosyllabic stems and _ -m- _ for other stems .",
    "c : noun class , au : augment , pre : prefix , neg sc : negative subject concord , pron : pronomial . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : survey ]",
    "for languages with isolating morphology such as english , verbalization templates are known to be a good way to explore with developing a controlled natural language , or may even suffice for a use case scenario , whereas this approach breaks down for languages with richer ( agglutinating ) morphology @xcite .",
    "so far , we have not found a single case where a plain template without supporting encodings of the grammar suffices.the survey revealed some general preferences , such as the _ -dwa _ option cf _ -phi _ , and dislikes ( _ futhi_/_kanye _ ) , and a few notable differences in preference between linguists and non - linguists , such as the clear preference for the singular for subsumption and the unanimous preference for _",
    "-dwa _ among the linguists , and",
    "overall the linguists agreed more on their preference compared to the non - linguists .",
    "the latter may have to do also with dialect and which region the isizulu speaker is from .",
    "these results can already feed into the development of a verbalization tool , but it requires more research before committing to invest in something like the grammatical framework ( http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ ) .",
    "this paper highlights motivational use cases for further investigation that benefits both isizulu linguistics and ict and we will continue to extend the algorithms , add more , and implement them so that domain experts can contribute and easily access , among others , the indigenous knowledge management knowledge base and scientific terminologies in isizulu .    as an added benefit ,",
    "these results may also inform translation algorithms and tools .",
    "take , e.g. , google translate english - isizulu machine translation online and enter ` all giraffes eat some twig ' is translated as _ yonke izindlulamithi udle igatsha _",
    "( translation obtained 27 - 3 - 2014 ) : _ izindlulamithi _ is in noun class 10 , so it should be _ zonke _ instead of _ yonke _ , and it misses the quantifier .",
    "this can be correctly verbalised with the pattern described in section  [ sec : main ] . as an aside , and looking toward additional verbalization patterns : its _ udle _ (",
    "2nd or 3rd person singular , imperative ) is also incorrect , because the verb has to be conjugated for the noun class of the first noun , which is 3rd person plural non - human ( in casu , _ zidla _ ) .",
    "another aspect to investigate in detail is the living / non - living thing distinction , which we avoided for subsumption by using a syntax - based short - cut . this may , or may not , work for other verbalization patterns .",
    "last , there are other issues to consider for verbalizing in isizulu , such as multilingual ontologies and , possibly modifying the _ lemon _ model @xcite to cater for annotation with , at least , the noun class , and finding ways for semi - automated ontology translations to / from isizulu .",
    "verbalizing formally represented knowledge in isizulu requires a grammar engine even for the relatively basic language constructs , which are due to , mainly , the noun classes , the agglutinative nature of isizulu , and contextual knowledge about the position of the symbol in the axiom .",
    "the salient features peculiar to isizulu that pose a challenge are : i ) the system of noun classes , ii ) the system of complex agreement , iii ) phonological conditioned copulatives , and iv ) verb conjugation .",
    "we developed a set of possible verbalization patterns for simple subsumption , disjoint classes , quantification , and conjunction .",
    "the survey on verbalization pattern preference revealed a clear preference for the _ -dwa _ option , and more variation in preference by the non - linguists .",
    "algorithms have been developed for the verbalizations @xcite , which will be extended further for other larger axioms and verb conjugation , and implemented .",
    "it will also be useful to investigate comprehension of the generated sentences and the effect of dialect on preferences .",
