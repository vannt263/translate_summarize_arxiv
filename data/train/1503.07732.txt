    "as a typical first - order phase transition , crystallization from the metastable melt begins with a nucleation process .",
    "there are two order parameters which characterize the transition ( density and ` crystalline order ' ) .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ evident that both parameters undergo the same dynamics during the transition process .",
    "consequently , a `` density - first '' , a `` bond - order - first '' , and several more complex phase transition scenarios have been proposed and vividly discussed in the literature .",
    "+ in this article we investigate the role of density and order fluctuations prior to nucleation and in the environment of the growing nucleus . as a model system",
    "we use spherical particles that have repulsive interactions only .",
    "a hard sphere model is the starting point for many theoretical treatments of granular , fluid , glassy and crystalline systems , and may be sufficient without further refinement if excluded volume interactions are more significant than long - range forces .",
    "technological examples where a hard sphere model is sufficient within important regimes include the study of metal solidification ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the formation of colloidal crystals ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "crystallization in hard spheres has been studied extensively but retains many open questions , of which the nature of the initiating fluctuation is a particularly active concern .",
    "+ classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) assumes that the emerging nucleus and the surrounding fluid possess the properties of the respective bulk phases , i.e.  that the emerging nucleus already has the order and density of the bulk crystal and that the surrounding fluid is not affected by the growth of the nucleus .",
    "this picture is not immediately credible in real liquids and colloidal suspensions , where transport of material is relevant .",
    "a detailed consideration of the outcome of mass conservation and finite transport speeds in the fluid has been made for vapour - liquid nucleation by lutsko et al .",
    "@xcite , leading to an expectation of substantial early density changes on a lengthscale larger than the initial nucleus ( for the vapor - liquid nucleation of lennard - jones particles ) .",
    "early densification in fluid - solid transitions is not _ a priori _ expected to be as important as in vapour - liquid transitions , due to the smaller difference in densities of the two phases , however this phenomenon has been reported in computer simulations of hard sphere crystallisation by schilling et al .  in 2010",
    "@xcite as well as from experiment @xcite .",
    "+ a computational study by russo & tanaka @xcite has examined structure and density changes for a set of nucleating trajectories at a number density @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the diameter of a particle . augmenting these trajectories with fluctuation data drawn from the metastable liquid , they note a coupling of order and density , but state that `` the density increase is foreshadowed by the prestructuring of the nucleus '' , adopting a position which we will crudely summarise as ` order - first ' .",
    "+ tan et al .",
    "presented , from optical microscopy , two distinct nucleation pathways for their colloidal system .",
    "both pathways began with hexagonally - ordered precursors then developing into either bcc or fcc metastable structures .",
    "a three step process was described , with the final phase being either bulk bcc or rhcp depending on the radius of the particles .",
    "the presence of bulk bcc , and also the dependence on radius , indicate that forces other than excluded volume were important in these experiments , however they remain an interesting reference in that the authors state that the nucleation sites were not correlated with increased local density .",
    "in fact the authors claim that `` nucleation rarely starts from the densest regions '' @xcite , see also a comment on this work by grnsy & tth @xcite . another investigation using microscopy , by lu et al .",
    "@xcite , also found a decoupling of the density and the nucleation event , stating : `` nucleation events were observed that rarely start from the denser regions of colloidal samples '' .",
    "+ kawasaki & tanaka @xcite found medium range ordered precursors of sizes larger than the critical nucleus in simulations of hard spheres .",
    "the lifetime of these structures was estimated as `` a few times the relaxation time @xmath2 '' .",
    "it was stated that the ordering was not icosahedral but rather hcp with multiple defects .",
    "a similar observation was reported by schilling et al .",
    "@xcite where low symmetry clusters of considerable size spontaneously transformed into highly ordered crystals .",
    "the effect of ordered precursor structures on crystallization should be to reduce the surface tension , which would be consistent with experiments of gasser et al .",
    "@xcite finding strongly aspherical shapes for the critical or near critical nuclei .",
    "the most recent minireview @xcite states that fluid - solid nucleation is probably multistep in most cases , but that the specific steps expected to be relevant in a given system are to date unclear",
    ". + the overview of the current literature is confusing : is the now - common idea of hard sphere nucleation as a two step process physically useful ?",
    "are densification and ordering separable from each other , and if so does one in general come first ?",
    "the emergence of unclear and apparently contradictory statements creates a need to re - examine the onset of crystallization .",
    "it is not desirable to reduce nuanced expositions from the literature to blunt and simplified statements , however we must remark that the ` density first ' @xcite and ` order first ' @xcite positions can not both be right . the summarised claim in schilling et al .",
    "2010 @xcite is that of a two step mechanism , remarkable in that it arises without attractive forces : `` the metastable fluid relaxes the density first , by producing dense low symmetry clusters '' .",
    "the key claim from russo & tanaka 2012 @xcite ) is of the opposite two step mechanism `` the transition from liquid - like to crystal - like happens at constant density '' .",
    "kawasaki & tanaka argue in a separate work @xcite that the sequence in detail is _ liquid _",
    "@xmath3 _ hcp _ @xmath3 _ dense rhcp_. + to clarify the sequence of events we argue that , at least at low and medium overcompressions , the fluid does indeed possess correlations over medium lengthscales in hexagonal order however these are typically accompanied by synchronised density fluctuations of the same lengthscale : the initiating fluctuation is of medium range and of low amplitude in both density and order , and has the same pattern of radial decay in each parameter as for the normal quiescent fluctuations .",
    "our analysis shows a synchronised increase of density and hexagonal order leading up to nucleation , although we allow that elevated hexagonal order is probably the more useful ( less noisy ) of the two reaction coordinates as a predictor of nucleation events .",
    "+ a further issue which has been mentioned in relation to this subject is the existence of two distinct ordered phases in 2d systems of hard discs .",
    "the hard disc phase intermediate between the fluid and solid ( called the hexatic ) is distinct from the crystal in that is has long - range orientational order and short - range translational order @xcite .",
    "there is no known hexatic - like phase of bulk 3-spheres , however the possibility of some related unstable state manifesting along the nucleation pathway has generated a certain amount of excitement , therefore translational and orientational order are typically distinguished in the literature in case they should turn out to be meaningfully different to each other .",
    "+ we argue that to claim a separation of translational and orientational ordering in 3 dimensional hard spheres would require much stronger evidence than has yet been seen : well - defined and distinct scaling of orientational and translational order in the fluctuations prior to nucleation events would need to be shown , and this has not been observed .",
    "orientational order is conventionally defined with respect to the neighbourhood of a single particle via a decomposition of the orientational distribution of ` bonds ' ( displacement vectors between neighbouring particles ) into spherical harmonics ( @xmath4 etc . ) , while translational order is typically computed using reciprocal - space observables not directly comparable to the orientational analysis .",
    "we attempt to test this distinction here by comparing translational and orientational order as directly as possible , via a direct - space analysis of bond lengths which is more comparable to the spherical harmonic analysis of bond orientations conventionally used to report the orientational order .",
    "+ in this work we analyze new simulations at low volume fractions and using different dynamical schemes , and we also revisit the 2010 dataset .",
    "we show that local and also medium - range density changes take place simultaneously to the initial formation of ( weak ) translational and orientational order , presenting an order - with - density model which is distinct from the order - first mechanism preferred by russo & tanaka @xcite .",

    "@xcite that weakly ordered precursors to crystallization should or might be present , and find that hexagonal ordering manifests gradually and continuously in the fluid prior to the formation of the first definitively solid - like particles , without evidence of any intermediate state . +",
    "as outlined in the introduction , previous studies of simulation data have suggested an important role for dense precursors in the structure formation process of hard spheres @xcite .",
    "we revisit an extant dataset comprising independent runs of @xmath5 hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 at a number densities of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , corresponding to chemical potential differences in of about @xmath9 per particle .",
    "nucleation at these overcompressions was observable without the use of accelerated sampling algorithms .",
    "the time evolution was defined by mc simulation mimicking brownian diffusion , with particles undergoing independent displacements at a fixed attempt frequency and small random stepsize much less than @xmath1 . in order to extend the original datasets ,",
    "further runs were made , using event - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) at @xmath6 thus testing for effects arising from the choice of dynamical scheme , and also using md simulations accelerated by flat histogram pruned and enriched rosenbluth forward flux sampling ( flatperm - ffs ) at lower overcompressions ( tab .",
    "[ tab : runlist ] ) .",
    "+ the known sampling difficulties for ffs calculations in this system @xcite were ameliorated using the flat histogram pruned enriched rosenbluth ffs method ( flatperm - ffs ) @xcite which was added to the functionality of the ` freshs.org ` @xcite sampling system for the purpose of this calculation .",
    "flatperm - ffs was found to give significant improvement in convergence relative to direct ffs .",
    "flatperm - ffs is a path sampling technique applicable to stochastic dynamical systems subject to rare events , i.e.  bottlenecks in their dynamics such as crystal nucleation .",
    "the scheme operates by selectively branching multiple copies of trajectories which make progress with respect to a specific collective variable ( here the number of particles in the largest crystalline cluster ) .",
    "as the dynamics are stochastic , the branched trajectories diverge with a proportion of them making further forward progress in the reaction coordinate .",
    "the gist of the gain from using flatperm rather than direct ffs is that paths are selected for branching in a bayesian way that takes account of their histories .",

    "+ we assert that nucleation of hard sphere crystals at low to medium overcompression begins with a collective fluctuation of radius approximately @xmath46 , simultaneously manifested in the density and in the positional order .",
    "the radius of @xmath46 corrresponds to order 100 particles ( depending on the shape of the nascent dense ordered region ) , indicating fluctuations of a highly collective nature .",
    "the increase of density at the nucleation site is supplied by long - range collective mass transport , with the amplitude of both density and order falling off gradually over the characteristic distance . + we accept the current speculation that it is possible to advance a description of the hard sphere nucleation process as two - step , but only in the weak sense that it begins with an order / density fluctuation which initially strengthens more than it grows ( before starting to grow more than it strengthens ) .",
    "at least when away from the glassy regime , the changeover between these two ` steps ' is smooth and there is no sign of any qualitative changes in the type of order manifested .",
    "+ the most agreement that we can find with and across the recent literature is that nucleation is initiated with a diffuse entity of finite spatial extent : this model contrasts with the nave image of a sharply defined region of daughter phase expanding outwards from a point , and is a good candidate to eventually supply control and understanding of nucleation phenomena by matching the lengthscale and structure of experimental probes with those of the initial fluctuation .",
