    "at the 1996 workshop in geometric topology f. d. ancel @xcite posed the following questions :    let @xmath1 be the fox - artin arc in @xmath0 which is pictured in figure 1 .",
    "is @xmath2 indecomposable with respect to free products ?",
    "are there infinitely ( uncountably ? ) many wild arcs @xmath3 in @xmath0 such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are non - isomorphic for @xmath6 ?",
    "fox and artin @xcite proved that @xmath2 is non - trivial .",
    "( @xmath1 is actually the mirror image of their example 1.1 . ) at the workshop ancel remarked that an incorrect proof that it is indecomposable had been published by rosaniec @xcite .",
    "he also noted that an affirmative answer to question 1.1 would give an affirmative answer to the countable case of question 1.2 by concatenating finitely many copies of @xmath1 ; the resulting groups are free products of copies of @xmath2 and so would be non - isomorphic ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii , p. 27 ) .",
    "these examples would have a finite but unbounded number of wild points .",
    "in this paper we answer these two questions in the affirmative . in particular , regarding question 1.2 we construct an uncountable family of arcs @xmath3 such that the fundamental groups @xmath4 are non - isomorphic for distinct indices and also are indecomposable and non - trivial .",
    "moreover each arc is wild precisely at its endpoints .",
    "we remark that if the fundamental group of the complement of an arc in @xmath0 is non - trivial , then it is not finitely generated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.6 ) .",
    "ancel also posed the following question , to which one can of course add the question of indecomposability .",
    "as of this writing these questions remain open , but it seems likely that affirmative answers could be obtained by the methods of this paper .",
    "let @xmath7 be the wild arc in the solid torus @xmath8 pictured in figure 2 .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is a knotted embedding such that @xmath10 is not isomorphic to @xmath11 for @xmath6 .",
    "is @xmath12 not isomorphic to @xmath11 for @xmath6 ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a criterion for the fundamental group of a non - compact 3-manifold to be indecomposable and non - trivial . in section 3",
    "we prove that the exterior of the fox - artin arc satisfies this criterion . in section 4",
    "we prove a lemma about embeddings of torus knot groups in torus knot groups . in section 5",
    "we construct the uncountable family of arcs mentioned above and verify its properties .",

    "then there is an isomorphism @xmath24 such that the restriction of @xmath25 to @xmath16 is the identity of @xmath16 @xcite . but @xmath25 sends any conjugate of an element of @xmath15 to the trivial element of @xmath16 .    by the kurosh subgroup theorem @xcite",
    "any subgroup of @xmath13 is a free product of a free group and conjugates of subgroups of @xmath15 and of @xmath16 . since @xmath26 in indecomposable and non - infinite - cyclic we may thus assume that it is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly @xmath27 must be conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath15 or of @xmath16 .",

    "continuing in this fashion we get that each @xmath28 is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 can not be the union of the @xmath28 since the non - trivial elements of @xmath16 are excluded .",
