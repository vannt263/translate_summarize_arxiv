    "the presence of a supermassive compact object , presumably a black hole , at the center of the dwarf elliptical galaxy m32 has been suspected for some time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence consists of rapid rotation of the stars near the center of m32 and a central peak in the stellar velocity dispersions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent study ( @xcite , 1998 ) used data from the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) to infer the rotation and dispersion velocities with a spatial resolution of @xmath4 in the inner @xmath5 of m32 .",
    "the fos data revealed a sharper rise in the stellar velocity dispersions than had been observed from the ground ; however the velocity resolution of the fos is limited , making that instrument only marginally useful for the study of a low velocity dispersion system like m32 .",
    "in fact , van der marel et al . (",
    "1998 ) found large point - to - point variations in their velocity dispersion measurements , making the dynamical interpretation uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , the case for a supermassive black hole in m32 , of mass @xmath6 , was considerably strengthened .    here",
    "we present observations of m32 carried out using stis , the space telescope imaging spectrograph , on hst .",
    "our data were obtained as part of the stis investigation definition team s ( idt ) key program to observe the nuclei of a sample of @xmath7 nearby galaxies in the spectral region centered on the calcium triplet , @xmath8 .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that will present stellar - kinematical evidence from stis for the presence ( or absence ) of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "the stis data improve on earlier ground - based and fos data from m32 in several ways .",
    "the spatial resolution of stis is @xmath4 , or @xmath9 pc at the distance of m32 , similar to that of the single fos aperture ; however stis provides continuous spatial sampling along a slit .",
    "the spectral resolution of stis in the g750 m mode ( @xmath10 km / s ) is much greater than that of the fos making stis a more suitable instrument for observing m32 , whose velocity dispersion outside of the nucleus is only @xmath11 .",
    "we were able to obtain from the stis spectra not only the lowest - order moments of the stellar velocity distribution  the rotation velocity and velocity dispersion  but also the full line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) as a function of position along the major axis .    a number of modelling studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have made predictions about the observable signatures at hst resolution of a supermassive black hole in m32 .",
    "the black hole is expected to be associated with three kinematical features .",
    "( 1 ) the stellar rotation velocity should remain flat , or rise slightly , into the central resolution element .",
    "( 2 ) the stellar velocity dispersion should exhibit a sudden upturn at a distance of @xmath12 from the center , reaching a central value of @xmath13  or greater depending on the mass of the black hole .",
    "( 3 ) the distribution of line - of - sight stellar velocities in the resolution element centered on the black hole should be strongly non - gaussian , with extended , high - velocity wings .",
    "part of the predicted rise in the velocity dispersion near the center would be due to these wings ; part to blending of the rotation curve from the two sides of the galaxy ; and part to an intrinsic rise in the random velocities .",
    "we see all three signatures of the black hole in the stis data .",
    "the velocity dispersion spike is most impressive ; in terms of the usual parametrization @xmath14 ( the dispersion of the gaussian core of the losvd ) , the central measured value is @xmath1 , while the value of @xmath15 corrected for the non - gaussian wings of the losvd is considerably greater , at least @xmath16 , or @xmath17 times the value in the main body of m32 .",
    "a detailed description of the observations and the data reduction is given in  2 . in ",
    "3 we describe the methods used to extract the stellar losvds from the stis spectra .",
    "we carried out independent analyses based on two spectral deconvolution routines : the fcq algorithm of r. bender ( 1990 ) , which is a fourier method ; and the mpl routine of d. merritt ( 1997 ) , which is based on nonparametric function - estimation techniques .",
    "the two algorithms gave consistent results for the low - order velocity moments of m32 ( the mean and dispersion ) but there were systematic differences in the recovered values of @xmath18 , the parameter that measures symmetric deviations of the losvd from a gaussian .",
    "we argue that the @xmath18 values are consistent after taking into account the biases in the two methods ; if our analysis is correct , the true values of @xmath18 in m32 are significantly greater than zero both within the region where the black hole s force is dominant and at larger radii .",
    "a preliminary interpretation of the m32 kinematical data is presented in  4 , where we address two basic questions : have we resolved the central spike in the velocity dispersions ? and : is the shape of the central losvd consistent with what is expected for a nucleus containing a black hole ?",
    "we answer `` yes '' to both questions , although the resolution of the central spike may be marginal if the black hole mass is near the lower limit of the allowed range . in any case",
    ", m32 is the first galaxy for which the imprint of the black hole s gravitation on the stellar velocities has been observed with a resolution comparable to that of the gas - dynamical studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we show that both the velocity dispersion spike and the wings of the central losvd are consistent with the predictions of simple dynamical models containing black holes , with masses @xmath19 in the range @xmath20 .",
    "more accurate estimates of @xmath19 will be presented in paper ii where the full kinematical data set will be compared to three - integral axisymmetric models .",
    "we adopt a distance to m32 of @xmath21 mpc ; thus @xmath22 corresponds to 3.25 pc .",
    "m32 was observed on 1998 september 04 with stis in the long - slit mode with wavelength centered on the ca ii triplet feature near 8561 .",
    "stis is described by woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and its on - orbit performance by kimble et al . (",
    "the present data are part of a survey of the nuclei of nearby galaxies being conducted by the stis idt ( hst program i d : 7566 ) .",
    "the goal of the survey is to place stellar kinematical constraints on the masses of nuclear black holes .",
    "two orbits of data with a total integration time of 4,898 seconds were obtained .",
    "the hst spacecraft tracking was operated in fine lock with a reported jitter of no more than 3 mas rms or 11 mas peak - to - peak .",
    "the aperture was @xmath23 with a position angle of 163@xmath24 , coincident with the m32 isophotal major axis .",
    "the ccd data were read out in the unbinned mode .",
    "spatial sampling at the focal plane was at every @xmath25 , corresponding to a 2-pixel optical resolution of about @xmath26 fwhm .",
    "outside of @xmath27 , the data were binned spatially to enhance the signal .",
    "the spectral resolution was approximately 38 km s@xmath28 .",
    "m32 spectra were obtained in the cr - split mode to assist with cosmic ray ( cr ) identification and rejection .",
    "the location of the galaxy center in the image was moved by approximately 4.5 rows along the aperture between the two orbits to ensure that residual detector sensitivity variations , that may not be completely removed from the data during reduction , are not mistaken for weak features .",
    "this form of dithering also assists with the identification of hot pixels in the ccd which do not rectify well .",
    "a spectrum of the star hr 7615 was obtained with the same stis aperture earlier in the program ( figure [ fig_spectra ] ) .",
    "this bright , k0 iii giant was used as a template when inferring the losvd of the stars in m32 from the stis spectra .",
    "template spectra of a handful of other bright , cool stars of various spectral types were also obtained and used to test the sensitivity of the spectral deconvolution to template mismatch .",
    "a set of spectral images of hr 7615 were taken centered at @xmath29 and @xmath30 with respect to the centerline of the aperture ( i.e. offset along the dispersion direction ) .",
    "these data were added together using appropriate weights to match the aperture illumination profile of m32 .",
    "each of these spectral images has a slightly different shift in its velocity centroid and the combined image provides a more accurate template for determining the kinematics of an extended object such as a galaxy .",
    "internal wavelength calibration images ( `` wavecals '' ) as well as an internal continuum lamp image ( `` flat field '' ) were taken for calibration purposes .",
    "an image that has had all of the instrumental response removed is said be a rectified image .",
    "the contemporaneous flat field spectrum was obtained in the portion of the orbit where hr 7615 was behind the earth .",
    "the flat spectrum was taken through the @xmath31 aperture rather than through the long aperture since the former is superior for removing the pixel - to - pixel detector response of a stellar point source .",
    "a contemporaneous flat field was used to remove the internal fringing which is significant for wavelengths greater than 7500   and which changes over time ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the fringing is far more serious for low dispersion spectra especially for high s / n than it is for our data taken in medium dispersion .    cosmic rays ( crs ) account for approximately 20% of the total signal and contaminate approximately 5% of the pixels in a typical exposure .",
    "crs were identified and removed using the following procedure .",
    "the centroids in the cross - dispersion direction were determined for each rectified image and the images shifted so that the galaxy core appeared on the same row .",
    "crs were identified and removed by comparing the flux in a given pixel to the flux in the corresponding pixel in subsequent images . for each pixel",
    ", outlying values were rejected and excluded when the frames were averaged together .",
    "our data set for m32 included 4 raw images .",
    "most pixels were found to have 4 frames contributing to their average values , while fewer pixels had 3 or less frames .",
    "only 2 pixels within the central @xmath32 had contributions from no frames .",
    "those pixels were assigned values representing the average of their adjacent pixels .",
    "the m32 data were reduced using two separate approaches : 1 ) `` shift and add , '' and 2 ) `` frame by frame . ''",
    "the latter relies heavily on a standard software package called calstis at goddard space flight center .",
    "the `` shift and add '' method starts by removing the detector response using contemporaneous flat , bias , and dark calibration files .",
    "cr hits are then removed using the procedure described previously .",
    "the frames are averaged together and the resulting frame is remapped to place the spectra from a single location along the aperture onto a single row . as with most spectrographs",
    ", stis produces spectra with s - shaped and pincushion distortions as well as spectra that are not aligned exactly with a row .",
    "a cubic interpolation was used to remap the spectra for later analysis .",
    "the remapping is not perfect , with centroid errors of approximately 0.1 pixel rms .",
    "this level of accuracy was deemed adequate , although we are working to improve it .",
    "in addition , the remapping produces very minor ( @xmath33 ) residual moir ripples in the data , which can be minimized but not completely eliminated .",
    "further work is also underway to measure and correct for this residual affect .",
    "the strength of the `` shift and add '' technique is that it preserves photometric accuracy .",
    "however it has the disadvantage of introducing a subpixel image smearing since each frame is registered to the nearest integer pixel .",
    "the philosophy of the `` frame by frame '' method is to apply all calibration corrections ( including the remapping described above ) to a single frame before the resulting frames are added together .",
    "this approach has the advantage of preserving the highest spatial resolution .",
    "however , a substantial fraction of the pixels in each frame in this case are interpolated values , potentially sacrificing some photometric precision . as noted above , crs contaminate approximately 5% of the pixels in a 20 minute exposure .",
    "after remapping , as many as 20% of the pixels must be assigned a reduced weight for the final averaging since a single pixel often gets remapped partially into several pixels in the new image .",
    "+ fortunately , both approaches to the data reduction were found to give very similar results .",
    "while the `` frame by frame '' method produced a higher apparent s / n ratio than the `` shift and add '' method , the former method is more prone to the introduction of systematic error .",
    "we adopted the more conservative approach of accepting a somewhat higher variance rather than risk the introduction of a bias .",
    "we therefore adopted the `` shift and add '' spectra for the analysis of the losvds in the present study .",
    "figure 1 shows spectra at several positions along the aperture . as noted above ,",
    "we are continuing in our efforts to refine the data reduction techniques still further .",
    "an observed spectrum @xmath34 is the convolution of the line - of - sight velocity distribution @xmath35 of the stars within the aperture with the spectrum of a single star @xmath36 : @xmath37 the goal is to extract an estimate @xmath38 of the true stellar broadening function @xmath35 given @xmath34 and @xmath36 , both observed with the same instrument .",
    "for @xmath36 we adopt the template spectrum of figure [ fig_spectra ] .",
    "two independent deconvolution routines were used .",
    "the first algorithm , the `` fourier correlation quotient '' ( fcq ) method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , constructs an estimate of the broadening function using fourier techniques .",
    "the fcq routine differs from earlier fourier algorithms ( e.g. @xcite ) in that the deconvolution is based on the template - galaxy correlation function rather than on the spectra themselves .",
    "this approach is less sensitive to template mismatch ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second algorithm , `` maximum penalized likelihood '' ( mpl ) , finds @xmath38 as the solution to a penalized likelihood problem .",
    "the mpl estimate of @xmath35 is computed on a grid in @xmath39 in such a way as to optimize the fit of the convolved template to the galaxy spectrum , subject to a `` penalty '' that measures the lack of smoothness of @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both algorithms are nonparametric in the sense that no explicit constraints are placed on the functional form of @xmath38 .",
    "however they differ in two ways that are important for the current study .",
    "the fcq algorithm requires that the absorption lines in the template spectrum be narrow compared to the broadened lines of the galaxy spectrum , i.e. that the galaxy velocity dispersion be large compared to the instrumental resolution .",
    "the mpl routine works well even when the galaxy velocity dispersion is small , as long as both template and galaxy spectra are observed at the same spectral resolution , at least in the case that the template star and galaxy have the same intrinsic absorption line properties ( an assumption that will not be tested here ) .",
    "the two algorithms differ also in the way they deal with the amplification of noise that accompanies the deconvolution .",
    "the fcq routine uses a wiener filter to suppress high - frequency components of the template - galaxy correlation function @xmath40 .",
    "the degree of smoothing is determined by a factor , called here @xmath41 , which fixes the width of the gaussian function used to model the low - frequency , or signal , component of @xmath40 .",
    "the choice @xmath42 corresponds to `` optimal '' filtering and larger values produce less smoothing ; the fcq algorithm adopts a default value of @xmath42 but automatically increases @xmath41 ( to a maximum of 1.3 ) if the recovered losvd shows evidence of significantly non - gaussian wings . in the mpl algorithm ,",
    "the level of smoothing is determined by a factor @xmath43 that multiplies the smoothness penalty function .",
    "this penalty function defines any @xmath35 that is gaussian as `` smooth , '' regardless of its mean or dispersion , via silverman s ( 1982 ) prescription ; in the limit @xmath44 , the mpl estimate of @xmath35 is the gaussian function which is most consistent , in a maximum - likelihood sense , with the galaxy spectrum .",
    "there is no a priori way of computing the optimum value of @xmath43 in the mpl algorithm , a point that we return to below .",
    "the different effects of smoothing on the form of @xmath38 are illustrated in figure [ fig_compare ] , which shows estimates of the losvd in the central resolution element of m32 as computed by the two routines .",
    "both algorithms produce rapidly - fluctuating solutions when undersmoothed , a consequence of the amplification of noise that always accompanies deconvolution .",
    "the only significant difference in this regime is the non - negativity of the mpl estimates , a consequence of the logarithmic form of the penalty function ( @xcite ) . as the smoothing",
    "is increased , systematic differences begin to appear which are related to the different smoothing algorithms in the two codes .",
    "solutions obtained via mpl tend to be more robust with respect to the degree of smoothing , producing in the limit of large @xmath43 a gaussian fit",
    ". however figure [ fig_compare ] suggests that estimates of certain quantities , e.g. the wings of the losvd , might depend sensitively on the choice of smoothing level in either algorithm .",
    "once an estimate of @xmath35 has been obtained , various quantites related to the line - of - sight velocity distribution can be derived .",
    "the simplest of these are the mean and rms velocities , which we denote by @xmath45 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "as is well known , both quantities are difficult to estimate for numerically - recovered losvd s since they are sensitively dependent on the form of @xmath38 at large velocities where this function is most poorly determined .",
    "a standard alternative is to describe @xmath38 by a gram - charlier or gauss - hermite ( gh ) series , the product of a normalizing gaussian with a sum of hermite polynomials @xmath46 , both expressed in terms of @xmath47 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath14 take the place of @xmath45 and @xmath15 ; while their definitions are to an extent arbitrary , these parameters are typically determined by requiring the coefficients of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , called @xmath51 and @xmath52 , to be zero ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because @xmath48 and @xmath14 describe the gaussian core of the losvd , they are relatively insensitive to deviations of @xmath38 from gaussianity at high velocities .",
    "information about these deviations is contained in the higher - order coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath18 etc . ;",
    "@xmath53 measures asymmetries in @xmath35 and @xmath18 measures the strength of symmetric , non - gaussian wings .",
    "the fcq and mpl algorithms derive the gh parameters from @xmath38 in slightly different ways ; details are given in appendix a.    when applied to the stis m32 spectra , the two algorithms were found to give consistent results for the lowest moments of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath48 , @xmath14 and @xmath53 .",
    "however the estimates of @xmath18 differed significantly at positions outside of the central @xmath4 .",
    "the fcq algorithm gave @xmath54 at almost all positions ; negative values of @xmath18 imply an @xmath35 that falls off more sharply than a gaussian at large velocities .",
    "the mpl algorithm gave values for @xmath18 in the range @xmath55 , almost all positive , corresponding to losvd s with super - gaussian wings .",
    "positive values of @xmath18 are expected near a black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and are also characteristic of models with radially - anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "we discuss the origin of this discrepancy in appendix b. we believe that the primary reason for the systematic difference in @xmath56 values is the low velocity dispersion of m32 .",
    "when a galaxy s velocity dispersion is comparable to the dispersion of the template star spectrum ( @xmath57  in the case of hr7615 ) , the fcq algorithm has difficulty recovering the true losvd ( figures b2,3 ; @xcite ) . the @xmath38 s recovered by fcq in this regime are more sharply truncated than the true @xmath35 s , leading to systematically low estimates of @xmath56 . for values of @xmath14 and s",
    "/ n comparable to those of m32 at @xmath58 , figure b2 shows that the estimates of @xmath18 generated by fcq depend only weakly on the true @xmath18 , with a bias that approaches @xmath59 for a true @xmath18 of 0.1 .",
    "the mpl algorithm suffers much less from this bias ( figures b3 - 5 ) .",
    "bias in nonparametric function estimates can always be reduced by reducing the degree of smoothing ( e.g. @xcite ) , which in the case of the fcq algorithm means increasing @xmath41 .",
    "figure b5c suggests that increasing @xmath41 from its default value of @xmath60 to values of @xmath61 can reduce the bias in fcq estimates of @xmath18 by factors of @xmath62 or greater , even when @xmath14 is as large as @xmath63 .",
    "we carried out this experiment with the stis data ; the results are shown in figure [ fig_h4 ] .",
    "the average @xmath56 values recovered by fcq in m32 are indeed dependent on @xmath41 ; a change in @xmath41 from @xmath60 to @xmath64 has the effect of increasing @xmath65 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "the latter value is essentially identical to the mean value of @xmath56 recovered via mpl .",
    "we note that the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath41 could be due either to the suggested explanation , i.e. the need to include more frequency channels for dispersions close to the instrumental resolution , or alternatively to a mismatch between galaxy and template spectral properties in the wings of the lines which results in incorrect continuum subtraction",
    ". we will not explore the second possibility here but note again that the monte carlo experiments in appendix b suggest that values of @xmath41 of order 2 are appropriate even when there is no template mismatch .",
    "the values of @xmath56 recovered by mpl are also dependent on the value of the smoothing parameter @xmath43 but much less so ( cf . figure [ fig_compare ] ) , until @xmath43 is made so large that the losvd is forced into a gaussian shape .",
    "the monte carlo tests summarized in figure b5b suggest that the bias in @xmath56 as recovered by mpl is likely to be only of order @xmath68 , several times smaller than with fcq .",
    "we conclude that the values of @xmath56 recovered by the two algorithms are consistent once their different biases are taken into account and that the values returned by mpl are likely to be more accurate .",
    "henceforth we adopt the mpl estimates .",
    "the full set of gh parameters derived from the stis spectra and their @xmath69 confidence intervals are given in table 2 ( fcq ) and table 3 ( mpl ) .",
    "for radii @xmath70 from the center the data were sampled at full resolution(@xmath71 ) while at larger radii they were binned spatially .",
    "the sampling at small radii is fine enough that the data points are somewhat correlated ; this was done to ensure that no information concerning the steep radial gradients of the profiles was lost .",
    "figure [ fig_broad ] presents losvds computed via the mpl algorithm at positions separated by about @xmath72 along the slit .",
    "one expects these broadening functions to obey @xmath73 , since for a point - symmetric galaxy , the velocity distributions should reverse after passing from one side of the galaxy to the other . the losvds of fig .",
    "[ fig_broad ] show approximately the expected symmetry .",
    "the right - hand column of figure [ fig_broad ] plots mean broadening functions averaged over the two sides of the galaxy , @xmath74 $ ] ; the central losvd has been symmetrized about @xmath75 .",
    "these broadening functions show clear and consistent deviations from gaussian form , in two respects .",
    "first , the central losvd exhibits strong super - gaussian `` wings '' at high velocities .",
    "these wings are possibly present also in some of the off - center losvds although with lower amplitude .",
    "second , the off - center losvds are asymmetric , with tails extending toward velocities opposite in sign to the mean velocity at each radius .",
    "these asymmetric tails are similar to those exhibited by a rotating system superimposed on a slowly - rotating bulge .",
    "systematic problems in the spectral deconvolution , e.g. template mismatch or incorrect continuum subtraction , can easily produce features like the wings and tails seen in the broadening functions of figure [ fig_broad ] .",
    "such errors in most cases would be expected to produce features located at the _ same _ velocity on both sides of the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) and are therefore an unlikely explanation for the asymmetric tails seen in the off - center losvds .",
    "the strong wings seen in the central losvd might more plausibly be attributed to systematic errors .",
    "however we found that the wings in the central losvd were robust ; they appeared in both the mpl and fcq estimates of @xmath35 ( though less clearly in the latter ",
    "see figure [ fig_compare ] ) and were relatively unaffected by changes in the assumed continuum level or slope .",
    "we carried out mpl deconvolutions where the fit to the galaxy spectrum was restricted to the region around only one , or two , of the three calcium - triplet lines ; these losvds also exhibited strong wings .",
    "we also tried using one of the other available stis stellar templates ; again the wings were only slightly affected .",
    "( the adopted template , figure 1 , produced the best overall fit to the galaxy spectrum . ) finally , we show in  4.2 that the wings are consistent with those predicted by stars in the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole .",
    "figure [ fig_rotate ] shows the gauss - hermite parameter @xmath48 , a measure of the stellar rotation , in the inner arc second of m32 . also plotted",
    "are @xmath53 , the lowest , odd gh moment of the losvd , and the `` corrected '' rotation velocity , @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 is a closer approximation than @xmath48 to the true mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corrected rotation velocity is lower in absolute magnitude than @xmath78 due to the asymmetric wings of the losvd noted above .",
    "the stis rotation curve is consistent with earlier ground - based measurements ( figure [ fig_gb ] ) at radii @xmath79 but with a larger peak value , @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore the rotation curve remains flat or slightly rising into smaller radii than seen heretofore , before falling at @xmath80 due to the blending of light from the two sides of the galaxy .",
    "there is a suggestion of an east - west asymmetry in the rotation curve though the effect is probably not significant .",
    "the @xmath53 profile is approximately antisymmetric about the center of m32 , as expected in a relaxed galaxy .",
    "@xmath81 reaches a maximum value of @xmath82 at @xmath83 and appears to gradually decline at larger radii .",
    "this behavior is similar to that predicted in axisymmetric models ( e.g. figure 8 of @xcite ) where @xmath53 remains essentially constant at radii outside the seeing disk .",
    "the gauss - hermite parameter @xmath14 is shown in figure [ fig_dispersion ] .",
    "also plotted is @xmath18 , the lowest , even moment of the losvd , and the `` corrected '' velocity dispersion , @xmath84 ; @xmath85 is a closer approximation than @xmath14 to the true rms velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the velocity dispersion rises suddenly inside of @xmath0 , approximately the same radius at which the rotation curve begins to fall .",
    "this coincidence suggests that at least part of the rise in @xmath14 is due to averaging of the rotation velocity over the two sides of the galaxy near the center , which has the effect of converting a rotation into an apparent dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corrected velocity dispersion @xmath85 rises well above @xmath14 near the center due to the strong non - gaussian wings of the losvd .",
    "the central value of @xmath85 is @xmath86 km s@xmath28 ; this should probably be interpreted as a lower limit since @xmath18 is only sensitive to the inner parts of the wings .",
    "( we argue below , based on model fits , that the rms velocity in the central resolution element may be as high as @xmath87 . )",
    "the ground - based data ( figure [ fig_gb ] ) are consistent with the stis dispersions at radii @xmath79 but fail to resolve the continued rise in @xmath14 inside of @xmath5 .    dynamical models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) predict @xmath88 profiles similar to that in figure [ fig_dispersion ] when observed with hst resolution : a central maximum ; a rapid drop , to small or negative values , at @xmath89 ; and a nearly constant value at larger radii .",
    "the predicted drop at @xmath4 is due to blending of the light from the two sides of the galaxy , which broadens the low - velocity part of the losvd and lowers the observed @xmath18 .",
    "the predicted central value of @xmath18 depends strongly on the black hole mass and on the psf ; our value , @xmath90 , is larger than in the two studies just cited , but these studies were based on rather low assumed black hole masses , @xmath91 .",
    "the true black hole mass is probably greater ( @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath56 at larger radii is surprising .",
    "previous observational studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) have returned smaller estimates for @xmath18 in m32",
    ". however we believe that these earlier results are not inconsistent with ours giving the difficulties involved with estimating this parameter .",
    "the van der marel ( 1994a ) study was based on wht observations with a much lower spatial resolution than the stis data . at radii @xmath92 ,",
    "the value of @xmath56 recovered by those authors was strongly affected by the psf blending of the rotation curve discussed above , yielding negative values in the central aperture . outside of @xmath93 , van der marel et al .",

    "although we believe that all of these studies are consistent with our conclusion that @xmath18 is significantly positive throughout the nucleus of m32 , we are less willing to strongly endorse the precise @xmath56 values shown in figure [ fig_dispersion ] , due to the sensitive dependence of this parameter on the details of the spectral deconvolution algorithm , continuum subtraction , smoothing level , etc . in paper ii we will construct dynamical models based on a range of assumed @xmath18 profiles in order to test the dependence of the inferred black hole mass on this parameter .",

    "we would like to estimate the degree to which the velocity dispersion spike is a product of this blending , and the degree to which it is due to a real upturn in the stellar random velocities .",

    "such wings are a generic prediction of the black hole model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; they result from stars on high - velocity orbits within the black hole s sphere of influence .",

    "the rotation curve is best fit by a smaller mass ( @xmath163 ) and the velocity dispersions by a larger mass ( @xmath164 ) ; if we require the models only to fit the mean square velocities , the fit is essentially perfect within the inner arc second .",
    "the stis observations probably come close to resolving the central upturn in the stellar velocity dispersions , which is predicted to occur at a projected radius of @xmath4 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "smearing of the stellar rotation field probably accounts for only a small part of the observed upturn in the dispersions .",
    "we note that dehnen ( 1995 ) was able to improve the fit of his axisymmetric models to the m32 data then available by varying the ratio of rotational to non - ordered azimuthal motions , which in our models would correspond to varying @xmath155 with position .",
    "if our simple model for the internal dynamics of m32 is approximately correct , figures [ fig_contour ] and [ fig_three ] imply that the stis data can place strong constraints on the mass of the central black hole .",
    "however such a conclusion must await the results of the more complete modelling of paper ii .",
    "that study may yield tighter constraints on @xmath19 , due to the use of the full kinematical data set ; or weaker constraints , due to the increased flexibility of general , anisotropic models .",
