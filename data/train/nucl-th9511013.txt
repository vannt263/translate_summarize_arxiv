    "with the advent of cebaf there is renewed interest in measuring the photoproduction of vector mesons @xmath0 @xcite . in anticipation of such experiments , the general nature of spin observables for vector mesons",
    "has been studied@xcite using a helicity amplitude approach . in this paper , that study is extended by introducing electric and magnetic multipole amplitudes for the photoproduction of vector mesons .",
    "the multipoles include the final state orbital angular momentum and thus , near threshold , provide a natural truncation to relatively few multipoles .",
    "also , since resonances have definite @xmath1-values , the isolation of isobar dynamics occurs most naturally in a resonant multipole amplitude .",
    "expressions for the full array of spin observables in terms of these multipoles are derived .",
    "then , general rules for the angular dependence of these observables and their dependence on multipoles are discussed .",
    "we hope that such rules will be helpful in analyzing future experiments .",
    "the general structure of the scattering amplitude for the photoproduction of vector mesons is :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the three - momentum and helicity of the initial photon and final vector meson ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the initial and final nucleon spins quantized along the @xmath7-axis , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ kinemat ] ) .",
    "isospin factors are suppressed .",
    "the current tensor @xmath8 is defined in the pauli - spinor space of the initial and final baryon .",
    "one can express this current in terms of 12 generalized cgln amplitudes@xcite , and proceed to find an expansion of those amplitudes in terms of multipoles .",
    "reference @xcite gives the transformation matrices connecting helicity amplitudes to a set of gauge invariant covariant amplitudes for this reaction . in our paper",
    ", we follow a direct approach to relate helicity amplitudes to multipoles , without using cgln amplitudes as an intermediate step .",
    "the quantum numbers introduced in the multipole analysis are : the total angular momentum @xmath9 and its projection along the @xmath7-axis @xmath10 the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath11 of the final particles ; which refers to @xmath12 @xmath13 or @xmath14 mesons . here , @xmath15 is the vector meson - nucleon relative orbital angular momentum . ]",
    "the total angular momentum of the final vector particle @xmath16 and of the initial photon @xmath17 with respect to the nucleon ; and the multipole type of the photon @xmath18 here , @xmath19 denotes either electric @xmath20 or magnetic @xmath21 multipole type .    introducing complete sets of initial and final angular momentum states",
    ", the @xmath22 matrix element can be brought into the following form : @xmath23 in other words : @xmath24 where @xmath25 the multipole amplitude @xmath26 and the transformation operator @xmath27 are defined as    @xmath28    and @xmath29 note that @xmath26 is independent of @xmath30 as seen above , the quantum numbers describing the initial and final states are quite similar , which is natural since both contain a vector particle(@xmath31 or @xmath32 ) and a nucleon .",
    "the only asymmetry in the quantum numbers is the use of @xmath11 in the final state instead of photon multipole type @xmath18 labels . for purposes of truncating near threshold and identifying resonances , it is more convenient to keep the final state orbital angular momentum as a good quantum number .",
    "in addition , our definition is a natural generalization of the pseudoscalar meson case . ]",
    "coupling of angular momenta , which is implied by the use of parenthesis in the above expression , is pictured in figure  [ addit ] :    a plane wave photon state @xmath33 is characterized by its momentum @xmath34 and helicity @xmath35 a multipole photon state @xmath36 is characterized by its total angular momentum @xmath17 and its projection onto a fixed @xmath37 axis , @xmath38 and the multipole type @xmath18 the overlap of a photon plane wave state of definite helicity with a photon multipole state is given by :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is @xmath41 for electric(magnetic ) multipoles , respectively .",
    "( we follow the phase convention of ref  @xcite for the photon multipole state . ) using this expression , matrix elements of the transformation operator @xmath42 can be simplified as :    @xmath43    all angular momentum constraints are stored in the wigner @xmath44 s and in the three-@xmath45 symbols . in the above expression , @xmath46 is given by :    @xmath47      in order to express the multipole amplitudes in terms of the helicity amplitudes , we need to invert eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , an orthogonality relationship for the transformation operator @xmath42 is needed .",
    "the operator @xmath42 obeys the following orthogonality property :    @xmath48    using this property , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be inverted to yield the multipole amplitudes :    @xmath49    equations  ( [ ortho],[invert ] ) remain valid when @xmath50s(nucleon spin projections along the @xmath7-axis ) are replaced by the nucleon helicities @xmath51 s .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath42 in a nucleon helicity basis can be generated readily by wigner rotations of the initial and final nucleon states .",
    "such nucleon helicity - based projection operators can be used to relate the helicity and multipole amplitudes .",
    "the explicit expression is :    @xmath52    as a result , it is found that the multipole amplitudes are directly related to the partial wave helicity amplitudes @xmath53 by : @xmath54    although @xmath22 is labeled by five quantum numbers , @xmath17 is dictated by parity , once the other quantum numbers are specified .",
    "this property follows since the initial and final state parities are respectively @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is 0(1 ) for magnetic(electric ) multipoles , or from eq .",
    "( [ multipole ] ) it is seen that    @xmath58    this result guarantees that there are at most 12 nonzero multipole amplitudes for any @xmath59 for a given @xmath60 there may be at most two different @xmath16 s @xmath61 three different @xmath62 s @xmath63 two different @xmath17 s @xmath64 and two multipole types @xmath65 thus , the total number of possible multipole amplitudes is @xmath66 looking at the eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) , one sees that for each set of quantum numbers either @xmath67 or @xmath68 gives a nonzero multipole amplitude .",
    "therefore , one deduces that there are 12 complex multipole amplitudes for vector meson photoproduction . on the other hand , there are 24 complex helicity matrix elements",
    ". since they are interrelated by parity invariance , only 12 helicity amplitudes are linearly independent .",
    "+      we now define multipole amplitudes for vector meson photoproduction by generalizing the notation used for pseudoscalar meson production . as in the pseudoscalar meson case , the labels @xmath69 are used to denote electric and magnetic multipoles .",
    "but for vector meson photoproduction , an additional @xmath70 designation is used to indicate how the vector meson s orbital angular momentum is added to its spin .",
    "the generalization of the multipoles notation to the vector meson case is therefore :    @xmath71    where the lhs applies to the pseudoscalar meson case and the rhs to the vector meson production case .",
    "the superscript is stipulated by giving the sign of @xmath72(pseudoscalar meson ) or @xmath73(vector meson ) .",
    "thus if @xmath74 or @xmath75 , the superscript is @xmath76 also if @xmath77 the mutipole has a subscript label of @xmath78 or @xmath79 respectively .",

    "we list the multipole expansion of 4 tensor polarizations and 37 nonzero double spin observables using the @xmath149 truncation in appendices b and c. although there are 42 nonzero observables(cross section + 4 single spin + 37 double spin ) near threshold , only 5 of them are necessary to determine three multipole amplitudes with their relative phases .",
    "therefore , three multipole amplitudes and two phases can be completely determined by measuring the cross section , a single spin observable @xmath150 and three double spin observables .",
    "_ therefore , even very near threshold determination of the magnitudes of nonvanishing multipole amplitudes @xmath151 require measurements of at least one double spin observable .",
