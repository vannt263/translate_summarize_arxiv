    "strong rotation is present in many geophysical and astrophysical flows .",
    "its effect is considered to become important when the rossby number ( the ratio of the convective to the coriolis acceleration , or the ratio of the rotation period to the eddy turn over time ) is sufficiently small .",
    "the large scales of atmospheric and oceanic flows for example are affected by the rotation of the earth .",
    "the rossby number for mid - latitude synoptic scales in the atmosphere is @xmath0 @xcite . in the sun ,",
    "the typical rossby number in the convective zone is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reynolds number ( @xmath4 , the ratio of the convective to the viscous acceleration ) in these systems is also very large , and the flows are in a turbulent state .    besides rotation , stratification is also important in the atmosphere , the ocean , and other geophysical flows .",
    "many studies have considered solely the effect of rotation in a turbulent flow , as a first step to gain better understanding of the fluid dynamics of geophysical systems . for rapid rotation ( very small rossby numbers ) ,",
    "significant progress has been made by applying resonant wave theory @xcite and weak turbulence theory @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "the flow is considered as a superposition of inertial waves with a short period , and the evolution of the system for long times is derived considering the effect of resonant triad interactions .",
    "this explains successfully the observed enhanced transfer of energy from the small to the large scales @xcite , and sheds light on the mechanism that drives the flow to be quasi - two dimensional at large scales @xcite .",
    "energy in three dimensional modes is transferred by a subset of the resonant interactions to modes with smaller vertical wavenumber .",
    "spectral closures @xcite give similar results",
    ".    however , resonant wave theories are only valid when the rotation period is much shorter than the eddy turnover time at all scales . for large reynolds numbers ,",
    "small scales are excited with a characteristic timescale proportional to the eddy turnover time , that decreases as the scales become smaller . therefore the approximations made in such theories can break down at sufficiently small scales , provided that the reynolds number is large enough for these scales to be excited .",
    "how the results of resonant wave theory extend to the case of only moderate rossby numbers but very large reynolds numbers is still unclear .",
    "several phenomenological theories have been developed to consider the case with large @xmath4 ( see e.g. @xcite ) leading to different results for the scaling of the energy spectrum .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "the study of rotating turbulent flows is constrained by the computational cost of properly resolving the inertial waves and the resonant triadic interactions , together with the cost of resolving the small scale fluctuations when @xmath4 is large .",
    "inverse cascades were shown to develop and anisotropies to appear in low resolution ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 grid points ) simulations @xcite , either solving the equations of motion directly or using a subgrid model .",
    "small aspect ratio boxes were considered in @xcite allowing for an increase in resolution .",
    "simulations at higher resolution were done later by @xcite studying in particular the behavior of the shell - to - shell energy transfer .",
    "recently , simulations with large reynolds number and small rossby number were performed using @xmath7 grids and 8th - order hyperviscosity @xcite , thus confirming the dominant role of resonant triads for rapid rotation at large @xmath4 , although the results also suggest that resonant wave theories can be valid only for a finite interval of time .",
    "all these simulations also give different results for the scaling of the energy spectrum at scales larger than the forcing scale ; it was shown in @xcite , using a truncated model , that this can be the result of how all the relevant timescales are resolved .    here",
    "we study the effect of rotation in a turbulent flow in high resolution direct numerical simulations ( up to @xmath8 grid points ) .",
    "simulations at this resolution were also performed recently in @xcite ; in this case , energy was injected at the largest scale available and the focus was solely on the scaling of small - scale fluctuations , showing depletion of the energy cascade and reduced intermittency .",
    "our main objective , on the other hand , is to study the statistical properties of the fluctuations in flows with moderate rossby numbers ( down to @xmath0 ) but at reynolds numbers large enough to observe the beginning of a turbulent scaling at scales smaller than the energy injection scale . to this end , we use coherent forcing at intermediate scales , leaving enough room in the spectral space for an inverse cascade of energy to develop when the rossby number is small enough .",
    "we also use the largest value of the reynolds number allowed by our grid to observe a direct transfer of energy at small scales . after describing the simulations , we study its spectral behavior , the shell - to - shell energy transfer , scaling laws and intermittency , and finally the geometry of the structures in the flow .",
    "we solve numerically the equations for an incompressible rotating fluid with constant mass density , @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the velocity field , @xmath12 is the vorticity , @xmath13 is the total pressure ( modified by the centrifugal term ) divided by the mass density , and @xmath14 is the kinematic viscosity . here , @xmath15 is an external force that drives the turbulence , and we chose the rotation axis to be in the @xmath16 direction : @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the rotation frequency .",
    "the mechanical forcing @xmath15 is given by the taylor - green ( tg ) flow @xcite @xmath19 , \\label{eq : tg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the forcing amplitude .",
    "although the forcing injects energy directly only into the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components of the flow , in the absence of rotation ( @xmath23 ) the resulting flow is fully three - dimensional because of pressure gradients that excite the @xmath16 component of the velocity @xcite .",
    "the resulting flow has no net helicity , although locally regions with strong positive and negative helicity develop .",
    "it is also worth noting that this forcing injects zero energy in the @xmath24 modes , whose amplification observed in the strongly rotating cases is only due to a cascade process .",
    ".[table : runs]parameters used in the simulations .",
    "@xmath25 is the linear grid resolution , @xmath26 the wavenumber used in the forcing , @xmath14 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath18 the rotation rate , @xmath27 the maximum number of turnover times computed ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the reynolds , rossby and ekman numbers .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : exponent ] shows the scaling exponents @xmath30 up to order 6 computed in runs b1 , b2 , and b3 .",
    "the scaling exponents are defined as the exponents in @xmath31 in the inertial range associated to the direct cascade of energy ( i.e. , for @xmath32 ) .",
    "runs b1 and b2 behave as non - rotating turbulence , with kolmogorov scaling ( @xmath33 ) and intermittency corrections ( the prediction @xmath34 of kolmogorov , and the intermittency model of intermittency in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence of she and lvque @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponent ] as a reference ) .",
    "however , run b3 has a distinct behavior with @xmath35 .",
    "as time evolves in this run , and the energy piles up at @xmath1 , the second order scaling exponent slowly converges to this value .",
    "low order moments follow the curve @xmath36 , but high order moments deviate from the straight line .",
    "the level of intermittency in the flow in all these runs can be measured in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "this quantity , together with the integral scales of the flow ( based on the parallel and perpendicular energy spectra ) , the taylor scale , and the micro - rossby number ( based on the taylor scale of the flow ) , @xmath38 are given in table [ table : micro ] for the runs in set b at different times .",
    "grid points of run b2 .",
    "the top view shows the subvolume in the direction of the axis of rotation ; in the bottom view the red and blue arrows indicate respectively the @xmath21 and @xmath16 axis.,width=302 ]    it can be seen that at late times run b3 evolves towards an anisotropic state in the large scales , with @xmath39",
    ". however , at small scales the flow seems more isotropic and at late times ( @xmath40 ) in this run @xmath41 . the micro - rossby number in runs b1 , b2 , and b3 take different values in the range @xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath44 is , within error bars , approximately the same for all the runs . as a result , the intermittency in the direct cascade of energy seems to be independent of the rossby number @xmath45 and the micro - rossby number @xmath46 .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : histo01 ] shows the time evolution of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the longitudinal velocity increments in run b3 .",
    "increments in the direction perpendicular to @xmath47 were computed , and the increment was taken equal to three times the kolmogorov dissipation scale @xmath48 in each run .",
    "the velocity increments in each run were normalized by their corresponding root mean square deviation @xmath49 . in agreement with the level of intermitency observed in the scaling exponents ,",
    "the pdfs show exponential tails indicating a larger than gaussian probability of large gradients to occur in the small scales .",
    "the amplitude of the tails of the pdfs as a function of @xmath50 does not change significantly with time .",
    "moreover , the root mean square deviation @xmath49 of the velocity increments @xmath51 increases with time .",
    "so if the pdfs are plotted versus @xmath51 ( instead of versus @xmath50 ) , the pdfs actually become wider at later times .",
    "this effect can be understood considering that once the inverse cascade of energy sets in , the total energy in the flow as a function of time increases .",
    "grid points of run b2 .",
    "blue corresponds to positive helicity , and red to regions with negative helicity .",
    "only regions with @xmath52 are shown , indicating strong quenching of nonlinearities .",
    "viewing points are identical to fig .",
    "[ fig : w3d].,width=302 ]    the intermittency reported in the previous section in the scaling exponents and the pdfs of velocity increments indicates that even after the inverse cascade sets in , the flow develops strong velocity gradients in the small scales . in this section , we present visualizations of the flow and consider the structures that emerge .",
    "figure [ fig : w3d ] shows a three dimensional rendering of the vorticity intensity in half of the computational domain ( @xmath53 grid points ) at late times .",
    "the top view corresponds to the subvolume in the direction of the axis of rotation .",
    "only regions with strong vorticity are shown .",
    "note that the flow is anisotropic and quasi-2d , as it is clear from the top view . in the bottom view",
    ", the development in the flow of large scale column - like structures can be seen . however , the columns display small scale structures with thin vortex filaments . these filaments seem to be ordered according to the large scale pattern .",
    "the presence of regions with strong vorticity even when the rossby number is small enough for the inverse cascade of energy to develop can be expected from the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : exponent ] and [ fig : histo01 ] , linked to the intermittency of the flow .    the local relative helicity @xmath54 in the same subvolume",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h3d ] .",
    "unlike in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , regions of strong vorticity are not correlated with regions of strong relative helicity .",
    "the net helicity over the entire box averages to zero , and locally regions of positive and negative helicity seem to be more isotropic and homogeneous than the other quantities studied .",
    "note that the local relative helicity can be quite ubiquitously strong , indicative of a local quenching of nonlinear interactions .",
    "in this work , we presented results of the study of the turbulent scaling laws and energy transfer in direct numerical simulations of rotating flows in periodic domains .",
    "spatial resolutions of @xmath55 ( set a ) and of @xmath8 grid points ( set b ) were used , while moderate rossby numbers ( down to @xmath0 ) and large reynolds numbers ( up to @xmath56 ) were considered , with enough scale separation to observe both a direct and an inverse cascade of energy when the rotation was strong enough .",
    "runs in set a were started from a fluid at rest , while runs in set b were restarted from a previous state of homogeneous turbulence . in the former case , for @xmath0 , a long transient was found in which the energy dissipation is small , as well as the energy flux to smaller scales . during this transient",
    ", the energy spectrum has a wide but steep spectrum , and its slope monotonously increases as a function of time .",
    "after turbulence sets in and the inverse cascade of energy develops , the energy spectrum evolves towards a @xmath57 scaling at scales smaller than the forcing scale .",
    "this late time evolution is observed in both sets of runs .    at late times",
    ", the energy flux in runs a5 , a6 , and b3 indicates an inverse cascade of energy in @xmath58 at scales larger than the forcing scale , and a direct cascade of energy at smaller scales .",
    "the net flux to small scales decreases as the rossby number decreases , while the amplitude of the flux to large scales increases .",
    "no inverse cascade is observed in @xmath59 .",
    "these cascades were confirmed by the study of the shell - to - shell energy transfer . the direct transfer of energy at scales smaller than the forcing is local ,",
    "although in the runs with small rossby number the transfer in @xmath58 is significantly slowed down . in this direction , the energy is transfered between shells @xmath60 and @xmath61 with small steps given by @xmath62 . as a result ,",
    "the direct transfer of energy in @xmath58 at small scales is mediated by interactions with the largest scale in the system , the energy containing eddies with @xmath1 .",
    "the timescale associated to the direct cascade in @xmath58 then increases , and its flux reduces . in @xmath59",
    "the transfer is direct at all scales , and a larger component than in the case of non - rotating turbulence is due to interactions with the forcing scale .",
    "these results are in good agreement with phenomenological derivations of the energy spectrum in rotating turbulence that consider a slow down in the energy transfer rate because of interactions between waves and eddies @xcite .",
    "the non - local interactions also lead to the development of anisotropies in the flow @xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade of energy that develops at scales larger than the forcing scale in runs a5 , a6 , and b3 is non - local , in the sense that the transfer of energy associated to this cascade takes place between disparate shells in fourier space . at late times , the inverse transfer superposes with a ( smaller in amplitude ) direct local transfer of energy .",
    "this small direct transfer of energy at large scales is the result of a reflection at @xmath63 , when the peak of energy reaches the largest scale in the box .",
    "consequently , the late time evolution of simulations of rotating turbulence may depend on the boundary conditions used , a property already observed in simulations of two dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "the study of structure functions in the direct cascade range shows that the second order scaling exponent for increments perpendicular to the rotation in runs with small @xmath45 is @xmath35 , in agreement with the energy spectrum .",
    "low order moments follow the curve @xmath36 but high order moments deviate from this law , an indication of intermittency .",
    "the level of intermittency in the direct cascade of energy , as measured by the exponent @xmath44 , is the same for runs with and without rotation .",
    "the spontaneous formation of strong gradients in the small scales is further confirmed by pdfs of the velocity increments and by visualization of regions of strong vorticity in the flow .",
    "more separation of scales is needed to study the intermittency in the inverse cascade of energy .",
    "because of its relation to small scale gradients , intermittency is believed to be associated only with the forward cascade of energy .",
    "the intermittency phenomenon is not observed in the velocity field in two dimensional turbulence for which the conservation of vorticity leads to an inverse energy cascade to the large scales @xcite , although intermittency in the vorticity ( which cascades directly to small scales ) is observed .",
    "it is unclear how the dual cascade of energy ( towards small and large scales ) in rotating turbulence affects the intermittency in the inverse cascade range .",
    "while intermittency is associated with small scale events , in many cases the strong events can affect the dynamics of the large scales , specially in systems close to criticality ; as an example , intermittency is a possible explanation for the occurrence of extended minima in solar activity @xcite ; it is also known to affect the transport of momentum in atmospheric surface layers @xcite .",
