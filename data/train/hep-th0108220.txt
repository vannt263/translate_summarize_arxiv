    "eleven - dimensional heterotic m - theory @xcite,@xcite exhibits two fundamental model - independent moduli .",
    "one , the length @xmath3 of the orbifold - interval @xmath4 , determines the strength of the string - coupling . the other , which appears upon compactifying the theory on a further calabi - yau threefold ( cy ) down to four dimensions , is the cy volume @xmath5 . to make @xmath6 and @xmath7 dimensionless , we choose following @xcite @xmath8 phenomenological considerations of heterotic m - theory with just the two orbifold fixed - plane boundary sources @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    "imply that @xmath9 or @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the 11-dimensional planck - scale and @xmath13 gev the grand unification scale .",
    "therefore the orbifold - modulus is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the generic cy radius .",
    "it is , however , an important feature of adding a further parallel ( to the boundaries ) m5-brane that these tight phenomenological constraints on @xmath6 and @xmath7 become relaxed due to the extra freedom coming from the m5 s g - flux ( see e.g.  @xcite,@xcite ) . in this case",
    "it is even possible to make @xmath6 large enough such that @xmath3 approaches its experimental upper bound of one millimeter in a large extra dimension scenario .",
    "however this extreme case is highly unnatural and implies a hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "it is an intrinsic feature of heterotic m - theory that the magnetic sources for the g - flux which are its two boundaries lead to a variation of the cy volume along the orbifold direction .",
    "if one considers the theory from its four - dimensional effective point of view it is therefore necessary to _ average _ the cy volume over the orbifold - size which introduces a dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , let us consider the situation with an additional parallel m5 brane located at the position @xmath14 along the orbifold - interval .",
    "this configuration guarantees that the m5 is compatible with the supersymmetry of the heterotic m - theory background and does not break it further .",
    "we assume that the m5 is space - time filling in the four external flat directions and wraps a holomorphic 2-cycle @xmath15 of the internal cy space . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath16 , which covers e.g.  the case of the quintic .",
    "it means that @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of just one basis holomorphic curve to be isolated , such that we do not have to integrate over its moduli describing its position inside the cy threefold . ] @xmath17 as @xmath18 with positive integer expansion coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "one can understand @xmath19 as the number of wrappings of @xmath15 around @xmath17 .",
    "the m5 induces an additional g - flux through the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is a basis of harmonic @xmath23 two - forms and @xmath24 $ ] is the four - form which is poincar - dual to @xmath18 . through",
    "its induced flux , the m5 has an influence on the @xmath25 dependence of the cy volume .",
    "namely , the bianchi identity in the presence of the m5 at position @xmath14 becomes @xcite,@xcite @xmath26\\delta(x^{11}-x_{m5 } )        \\big]\\wedge dx^{11 } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in turn leads to the following expression for the cy volume ( in units of @xmath27 ) as a function of the orbifold coordinate and @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath29 the parameter @xmath30 is controlled by the g - flux integrated over the cy at the visible boundary @xmath31 while the parameter @xmath32 describes the g - flux coming from the m5 brane source @xmath33\\ ] ] notice that both @xmath30 and @xmath32 are positive quantities ( for @xmath30 this holds as long as the `` instanton number '' @xmath34 on the visible boundary exceeds the one of the hidden boundary ) .",
    "the rhs of the bianchi identity must be cohomologically trivial .",
    "therefore one arrives by integration over the orbifold - coordinate at the following anomaly cancellation constraint @xmath35 = 0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] which holds at the cohomology level . in terms of the g - flux parameters a further integration over",
    "the cy renders this cohomology condition into an actual flux - equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 gives the g - flux integrated over the hidden boundary ( i.e. it is formally the same as @xmath30 but with @xmath38 substituted by @xmath39 ) .",
    "because finally we will need the cy volume in the context of the four - dimensional effective theory , we have to average it over @xmath25 between @xmath40 and @xmath3 which gives @xmath41 where we have expressed the m5-brane position @xmath42 through the dimensionless parameter @xmath43 @xmath44 with @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "thus the magnitude of the slope in the expression ( [ cyvol ] ) of the average cy volume hinges on both the boundary plus the m5-brane g - flux in an opposing way .",
    "whereas the boundary flux tends to curve the volume dependence downwards , the m5 flux tends to bend it upwards .",
    "this counterbalance property will show up prominently in our stabilised solution later on .",
    "the formulation of heterotic m - theory is only known as a perturbative expansion in @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the leading order @xmath46 terms give rise to the linear dependence of @xmath47 on the orbifold coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "let us therefore now examine for which parameter values we can trust the linear approximation .",
    "obviously , we can no longer trust it when the cy volume @xmath47 becomes negative , i.e.  unphysical .",
    "a way out when this happens would be to go beyond the linear approximation and use results of the full non - linear treatment of the supersymmetric warped background geometry .",
    "this would give a manifestly positive quadratic volume thereby eliminating the negative volume problem @xcite,@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the fact that in this paper , we will need the khler - potential later on , which is only known to first nontrivial @xmath46 order , we have to seek for stabilisation within the linear approximation framework and therefore have to check for its validity .",
    "first , it is obvious that the linear approximation should not break down , i.e.  encounter a negative cy volume , before having reached the m5 coming from the visible boundary .",
    "this then imposes the following parameter constraint ( @xmath48 denotes the position where the volume might vanish ) @xmath49 second , we should also make sure that a negative cy volume does not appear in the second region between the m5 and the hidden boundary at @xmath50 . in this second region",
    "two things can happen .",
    "either one has a flux - relation @xmath51 which means that @xmath47 is increasing beyond the m5 and thus nullifies the negative volume problem for the second region . or one could have @xmath52 which gives a constant or decreasing @xmath47 beyond the m5 . to guarantee that @xmath47 in this second case does not become negative before the hidden boundary",
    "is reached means to constrain the slope of the running volume which is determined by the fluxes .",
    "therefore , we have to require in addition that @xmath53 to summarise , we have to require either ( [ con1 ] ) with ( [ con2a ] ) or complementary ( [ con2b ] ) together with ( [ con2 ] ) ( notice that ( [ con1 ] ) is implied by ( [ con2b ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) ) in order to trust the first order linear volume approximation .    since the succesful prediction of four - dimensional data , in particular newton s constant @xcite,@xcite , hinges on the above values ( [ phenval ] ) , the question arises of how to stabilise them",
    ". this will be the main concern of this paper .",
    "there are various non - perturbative effects which give rise to interesting potentials for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the framework of",
    "the heterotic string the main non - perturbative mechanism for breaking supersymmetry has been gaugino condensation in a hidden sector @xcite . in the context of heterotic m - theory gaugino condensation appears even more naturally as the gauge theory on the hidden boundary now becomes strongly coupled @xcite .",
    "moreover , with the geometrical separation of the two @xmath54 gauge groups there appears yet another class of non - perturbative objects .",
    "these are the open membranes ( om ) which either connect one boundary with the other or with some intermediate m5-brane placed parallel to the boundaries along the orbifold - interval .",
    "furthermore , also m5-instantons and m2-instantons can appear .",
    "the former wrap the whole internal cy whereas the latter wrap a 3-cycle of the cy .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that through the combined effect of multi - gaugino condensation on the hidden wall together with parallel ( to the boundaries ) m2-instantons a phenomenologically satisfactory stabilisation of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 moduli could be achieved . while the parallel m2-instanton breaks all supersymmetry explicitly @xcite and one can not use supersymmetric tools to derive the potential , other non - perturbative sources like the mentioned orthogonal ( to the boundaries ) om s or m5-instantons are compatible with the supersymmetry of heterotic m - theory .",
    "they will break supersymmetry spontaneously .",
    "in general there are two different stabilisation scenarios which have to be distinguished .",
    "they differ in the energy - scale at which stabilisation might occur .",
    "either the theory could become stabilised above the threshold given by the inverse orbifold - size @xmath55 or below .",
    "in the former case one would have to work with the eleven - dimensional formulation of heterotic m - theory if stabilisation even trespasses the cy compactification scale @xmath56 or otherwise with the effective five - dimensional action @xcite between the two thresholds .",
    "this case offers the intriguing possibility that local supersymmetry gets broken via gaugino condensation @xcite,@xcite only if energies become so low that the orbifold interval shrinks to a point .",
    "however it leads to the phenomenologically unsatisfactory situation that the mass of the gravitino @xmath57 which is proportional to @xmath58 becomes too high .",
    "( for a discussion of this case with an inverse orbifold - length at the intermediate scale @xmath59 gev see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , subsequently we will search for a stabilisation in the energy - regime below the @xmath60 threshold , which necessitates a description of heterotic m - theory through its effective four - dimensional n=1 supergravity action .",
    "this had been derived in @xcite . in particular we will analyse the case of vanishing charged scalar vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) .    as it turns out that in the regime where one can trust the perturbative formulation of the effective four - dimensional heterotic m - theory the non - perturbative m5-instantons and gaugino condensation appear exponentially suppressed , we will focus on the effect of om - instantons in the presence of a parallel m5-brane which is the dominant one . by minimising the corresponding potential for the moduli",
    ", we find that om - instantons do stabilise the m5 in the middle of the orbifold interval .",
    "furthermore , the moduli @xmath7 and @xmath6 get stabilised at values @xmath61 to find this minimum of the effective potential it is essential to have nontrivial g - fluxes caused by the boundaries and the m5 .",
    "they trigger a dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath6 which is responsible for the stabilisation . indeed , for consistency with the perturbative formulation of the theory , the g - fluxes integrated over the visible boundary and the m5 have to be equal @xmath62 in the full eleven - dimensional picture this om - instanton vacuum corresponds to a cy volume which falls off linearly and approaches zero in the middle of the interval where the m5 is located .",
    "for the second half of the interval it stays constant due to the flux - equality ( [ fluxequality ] ) @xmath63 we will however show that there is evidence that the full theory beyond the first order shifts the volume - zero on the second half - interval to a non - vanishing positive constant value .",
    "it is intriguing to see that the _ relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is simply determined by the flux @xmath30 coming from the visible boundary _",
    "@xmath64 moreover , since at the minimum the leading order terms vanish it is important to include all first order @xmath46 corrections .",
    "this gives a manifest positive contribution to the vacuum energy possessing an interesting exponential suppression factor .    in the following table and @xmath65 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath66 will become clear in the next section .",
    "] we give a quick impression of what will be the relevant data with om - instantons present for integrated g - fluxes @xmath30 and cy volumes @xmath67 on the visible boundary and what will be their respective influence on @xmath6 , @xmath7 , on the two heterotic m - theory expansion parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , on the vacuum energy @xmath70 , on the related supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath71 and finally on the gravitino mass @xmath72 .",
    "a small @xmath30 can be seen to ruin the smallness of @xmath68 and thereby the reliability of the perturbative formulation of the theory .",
    "thus the @xmath30 fluxes have to be considerable . at the same time",
    "a not too small @xmath30 allows to bring the supersymmetry - breaking scale into the desired tev region , however , simultaneously rises the vacuum energy @xmath70 .",
    "it can be seen that an increasing @xmath67 has a similar effect on @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a decreasing @xmath30 .",
    "however , its influence on @xmath68 , @xmath69 is rather modest .",
    "generically , one obtains a @xmath7 which is one or two magnitudes larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the basic reason for this is to keep the parameter @xmath68 small enough .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , we kept @xmath6 fixed ( at @xmath73 ) since it will be determined dynamically subsequently by minimizing the potentials whereas @xmath74 are regarded as free `` input '' parameters . from the table",
    "it can be seen that an increasing @xmath67 yields a decreasing @xmath68 and a slightly increasing @xmath69 . on the other hand an increasing @xmath75 yields the reversed effect .",
    "finally a varying @xmath76 has no influence on @xmath68 and @xmath69 and merely affects the modulus @xmath77 which grows when @xmath76 decreases .",
    "therefore , we will assume @xmath76 to be fixed at a value of 30 in the rest of this paper . in conclusion",
    "we should look for stabilisation in the parameter - region where @xmath67 is rather large , say @xmath78 while @xmath75 should not be too big , say @xmath79 .    in this paper we will examine the region of moduli space where charged scalar @xmath80 ( which originate from the reduction of the ten - dimensional gauge - field ) vev s are absent or comparatively small .",
    "basically this means that we look for stabilisation of heterotic m - theory at energies high enough such that the gut gauge group is still ( spontaneously ) unbroken . for vanishing @xmath80 the perturbative contribution @xmath81 to the superpotential and",
    "the charged scalar khler - potential @xmath82 can be neglected subsequently @xmath83 it is important to note that in the case with @xmath84 the sum @xmath85 as given by ( [ ksm5 t ] ) includes all corrections of order @xmath68 and order @xmath69 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the subleading contributions to the leading order expressions for @xmath86 and @xmath87 are proportional to @xmath88 and therefore vanish , while @xmath89 is already of order @xmath68 .",
    "moreover for the case of @xmath90 it is known that @xmath91 vanishes @xcite,@xcite @xmath92 the moduli - potential for the @xmath93 case which originates from the contributions @xmath94 has been first calculated in @xcite and contains the following first and next - leading order terms @xmath95 note that here where the @xmath89 contribution has not been included the subleading terms in the second line can give a negative contribution .",
    "we will show in the next section that there are also @xmath96 terms at subleading order resulting from the inclusion of @xmath89 rendering the potential manifestly positive .",
    "moreover we will see that the leading order potential vanishes at its minimum and therefore carefully including all subleading contributions becomes essential .",
    "let us now extract the moduli - potential to subleading order resulting from the two om instantons connecting the intermediate m5 with either boundary .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xcite @xmath97 while the khler - potential up to subleading order reads @xmath98 notice the inclusion of the subleading @xmath89 part .",
    "in the expression for the four - dimensional supergravity - potential ( [ potential ] ) we will consider only the covariant derivatives @xmath99 with respect to the @xmath100 moduli , i.e.  we will neglect the dependence on complex - structure and bundle - moduli .",
    "the potential is composed out of four structurally different parts which are hierarchically ordered in the @xmath101 region .",
    "we will examine now their order of magnitude in this moduli space region . from",
    "the superpotential one easily recognizes that partial derivatives of @xmath102 with respect to the moduli fields do not generate further factors of @xmath7 or @xmath77 .",
    "thus for a determination of the magnitude of the four different parts , it is sufficient to take the leading behaviour of the khler - potential and its derivatives . this can be found in appendix a.    let us start with the @xmath103 term which is of @xmath104 with respect to a counting of @xmath7 and @xmath77 prefactors .",
    "the second sort of contribution to the potential is of the form @xmath105 the expressions from the appendix show that these terms range between @xmath104 and @xmath106 in magnitude .",
    "a third class consists of mixed terms and is given by @xmath107 with ranges between @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "finally , the last class of terms is @xmath111 this class dominates the three others since it exclusively gives the leading @xmath112 and subleading @xmath113 contributions . therefore it is enough to consider just this class to ensure that all leading and subleading contributions in @xmath68 and @xmath69 are taken into account .",
    "notice that beyond this order the khler - potential of the theory is not known and therefore it would make no sense to include an incomplete set of terms at these lower orders coming from the three other classes of terms .",
    "concerning the last class of dominant terms , the @xmath113 contributions which come from @xmath114 are suppressed by @xmath68 against the leading @xmath112 contribution from @xmath115 .",
    "this means that we have to include for the latter also its subleading corrections whereas for the former it is enough to consider merely their leading @xmath116 behaviour .      with help of the expressions collected in appendix",
    "a one derives the om potential for the moduli .",

    "it is important to notice the sign - difference of the cosine term between leading and subleading order .",
    "it is this difference which prohibits @xmath70 from becoming zero at its minimum and thereby leads to a _",

    "hence , the _ parallel m5 becomes stabilised at the symmetric position in the middle of the orbifold - interval_. this could have been anticipated since both the khler - potential and the om superpotential are invariant under the symmetry which exchanges @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the om - potential is mirror - symmetric with respect to the fixed - point @xmath130 which means that it must exhibit a minimum or a maximum at the fixed - point .",
    "the explicit analysis confirms a minimum .",
    "it is important to realize that for this value the leading - order part of the potential vanishes and it is the sub - leading term which contributes alone and hence becomes responsible for supersymmetry - breaking and a non - vanishing vacuum energy .    as an aside",
    "let us compare our result with the expression ( [ moorepotential ] ) of @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in the additional @xmath96 terms which we have included in the subleading terms and lead to the complete squares .",
    "their origin can be traced back to the subleading corrections coming from @xmath115 .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is _ important to include the contribution from @xmath89 to the khler - potential _ which gives rise to @xmath115 and which seemingly had been omitted in the derivation of the potential in @xcite . finally , one could be inclined to view ( [ reihe ] ) as the begin of a series expansion which roughly could be summed up to @xmath131 .",
    "this then suggests that higher order in @xmath117 contributions could not endanger the leading - order result when summed up as long as @xmath132 .    before proceeding with the minimisation analysis",
    "let us briefly reflect on a consequence of ( [ lat1 ] ) and ( [ lat2 ] ) . with the definition of @xmath133 inserted into ( [ lat1 ] ) and setting @xmath130 , we see that the axion @xmath134 cancels out and the minimisation condition ( [ lat1 ] ) implies setting the scalar @xmath135 to @xmath136 in particular @xmath137 can be zero .",
    "proceeding with the minimisation , let us set @xmath130 and thus obtain for the om - potential @xmath138 notice once more that this comes from the subleading terms as the leading terms vanish . because @xmath77 and @xmath7 are @xmath6 dependent ,",
    "@xmath70 becomes a function of @xmath6 which can be minimised with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is more convenient to minimise with respect to @xmath77 instead since alternatively @xmath7 can be viewed as a function of @xmath77 once we have fixed @xmath130 .",
    "the vanishing of the first derivative of @xmath70 with respect to @xmath77 leads to the condition we denote the derivative @xmath139 . ]",
    "@xmath140 the derivative of the average linear volume with respect to @xmath77 is given by @xmath141 where we have defined the flux - parameter @xmath142 which controls the `` running '' of @xmath7 with @xmath6 @xmath143 for the case with the m5 located in the middle of the orbifold - interval .",
    "let us now solve ( [ ommini ] ) in the moduli - region @xmath144 . by neglecting the @xmath145 against the @xmath19 term and employing ( [ vderivative ] ) , one obtains upon again neglecting @xmath146 against @xmath147 @xmath148",

    "explicitly , the second derivative of the potential is proportional to @xmath158 ^ 2          + \\frac{1}{j^2}+\\big(\\frac{v_j}{v}\\big)^2          -\\frac{v_{jj}}{v } \\bigg)\\ ] ] the first term in square brackets vanishes at the extremal point by using the extremality condition ( [ ommini ] ) .",
    "the remaining terms are manifestly positive except for the last one containing the second derivative of @xmath7 .",

    "we emphasize that this minimum of the potential only occurs because we have a non - constant cy volume whose running along the orbifold - interval is caused by the non - trivial g - flux . in contrast a constant cy volume and thereby an @xmath6 independent average @xmath7 would lead to the well - known runaway - behaviour for ( [ simpleompotential ] ) .",
    "let us now check for what values of @xmath30 and @xmath32 we can trust the obtained solution , i.e.  the first order approximation .",
    "evaluating the corresponding constraints for the vacuum ( [ omsolution ] ) , either ( [ con1 ] ) with ( [ con2a ] ) or ( [ con2b ] ) together with ( [ con2 ] ) , both lead to the flux - equality @xmath160 which can be used to express the obtained stabilised value for @xmath6 purely in terms of visible boundary data @xmath161 thus the solution saturates the bound @xmath162 imposed by ( [ con1 ] ) which means that the cy volume @xmath47 becomes zero at the location of the m5 .",
    "thus compatibility of the stabilised solution with the first order approximation gives a precise relationship between the fluxes on the visible boundary and the m5 .",
