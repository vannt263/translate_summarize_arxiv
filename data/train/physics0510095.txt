    "during the last decade , dynamic force microscopy ( dfm ) used in the tapping mode has been found as a suitable tool to investigate surface morphology , particularly of soft materials and has been widely used to investigate a very large range of samples including polymers @xcite , biological materials @xcite or organic layers @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the dfm was developed around the non - contact atomic force microscopy ( nc - afm ) mode and has shown that contrasts at the atomic scale could be achieved on semiconductors and insulators surfaces @xcite .",
    "experimental  and theoretical features dedicated to the description of these two dynamic modes have been widely discussed in previous papers @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the large sensitivity of the oscillating tip - cantilever system ( otcs ) was based on the large value of its quality factor and on its non - linear dynamics in the vicinity of the surface @xcite . even if the precise origin of the nc - afm images contrast remains an open question , tapping and nc - afm results are the consequence of the same non - linear behavior of the otcs so that their differences are purely technical .",
    "the aim of this article is to show from a theoretical point of view that the non - linear dynamics of the otcs leads to various stability domains that may help to a better understanding of the way the instabilities appear in tapping and the reason why the nc - afm mode , while being so sensitive , keeps , in most of cases , a stable behavior .",
    "the experimental study of the stability of the non - linear behavior of the otcs can be performed through the study of approach - retract curves , from which are deduced the variations of the oscillations properties as a function of the tip - sample distance @xcite .",
    "but the ultimate goal of the approach - retract curves is to extract the surface properties from amplitude and phase variations ( tapping ) or from frequency shift and damping signal ( nc - afm ) . in other words , the measure of the evolution of the amplitude with a fixed drive frequency and a drive amplitude or the one of the frequency shift are two complementary ways to investigate the non - linear behavior of the otcs .",
    "thus in this work , the analysis of the stability of the oscillations will be done from the study of the distortion of the resonance peak of the oscillator due to the coupling with the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "the first part is dedicated to a description of the non - linear behavior of the otcs at the proximity of the surface .",
    "to do so , a specific theoretical frame giving the explicit temporal dependance of equations of motion of the otcs is developed .",
    "the description is then based on the equations of the stationary state of the otcs that can be interpreted either for the tapping or for the nc - afm . in the second part",
    ", these equations are used to analyze the stability of the stationary state .",
    "the third part is a discussion of the results obtained and the way they can be interpreted for dfm experiments .",
    "the sketch of the otcs and notations used in the present work are shown in fig.[figschemageom ] .",
    "when a tip oscillates above a surface , several situations can occur .",
    "if the oscillation amplitude @xmath0 is smaller than the distance @xmath1 between the surface and the equilibrium position of the otcs , the tip never touches the surface . on the contrary , for oscillation amplitudes larger than @xmath1 ,",
    "the tip exhibits intermittent contact situations .",
    "the time during which the tip touches the surface depends on several factors , among which , the local stiffness of the surface is a key parameter .",
    "for example , for very soft materials , the indentation depth can be as much as the oscillation amplitude @xcite , thus the tip spends half of the oscillation period into the substrate .",
    "for hard materials , the time during which the tip touches the surface is negligible compared to the oscillation period .",
    "thus , when intermittent contact situations occur , various assumptions are required to describe the contact between the tip and the surface @xcite . for the present purpose ,",
    "such an analysis introduces useless complications , therefore we only focus on the non - contact situations .",
    "when uniquely non - contact situations take place , the tip never touches the surface during the whole oscillation period so that the interaction between the tip and the surface can be described with a simple expression .",
    "the attractive coupling force between the tip and the sample is assumed to derive from a sphere - plane interaction involving the disperse part of the van der waals potential @xcite .",
    "the differential equation describing the position of the tip s apex as a function of time , @xmath2 , is given by  :    @xmath3 \\text{,}\\ ] ]    with  :    @xmath4 = -\\frac{hr}{6\\left [ d - z\\left ( t\\right ) \\right ] }   \\label{equpotvdwdisp}\\ ] ]    @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the resonance pulsation , quality factor , effective mass and cantilever stiffness of the otcs .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the external drive force and drive pulsation .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 are the hamaker constant , the tip s apex radius and the distance between the surface and the equilibrium position of the otcs ( see fig.[figschemageom ] ) .",
    "different ways can be used to observe the non - linear behavior of the oscillating nanosphere at the vicinity of a surface .",
    "the most informative is to record several resonance curves as a function of the distance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to keep the oscillation at a given frequency with a fixed excitation amplitude and to record variations of the oscillation amplitude and of the phase as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this latter measurement is readily done by performing approach curves with the tapping mode @xcite . as noted in the introduction , the difference between tapping and nc - afm is purely technical but , from a practical point of view , a description of the variation of the oscillating behavior showing the correspondence between the two modes is not straightforward .",
    "for example , the nc - afm mode is probably the simplest way to describe a dfm experiment @xcite , but the non - linear behavior appears in a quite subtle way while it is immediately observed with the tapping mode .",
    "the present section is divided into three parts .",
    "the first one details the specific theoretical frame for the obtention of the equations of motion in amplitude and phase of the otcs .",
    "a coarse - grained method gives the equation describing the time evolution of the stationary state of the otcs as a function of the coupling term between the tip and the surface .",
    "this allows to compute the stability of the stationary state .",
    "the next part is a description of the distortion of the resonance peak as a function of the distance .",
    "this provides the basis of the discussion about the oscillating behavior and the stability of the branches which is detailed in section [ sectionstability ] .",
    "this also provides an easier way to discuss experimental measurements as those obtained in tapping and nc - afm modes . as an example",
    ", we use the evolution of the resonance peak to discuss typical variations of the amplitude and phase in tapping mode when the drive frequency is slightly below the resonance one @xcite .",
    "these variations , regularly observed , are the most obvious experimental evidences of the non - linear dynamics of the otcs .",
    "the third part deals with the analysis of the resonance frequency shift observed in nc - afm and the way its stability can be interpreted .",
    "we search a solution to the temporal evolution of the otcs by using a variational solution based on the principle of least action .",
    "even though this approach exploits the same physical concepts than the one which had led to the coupled equations in amplitude and phase of the stationary state of the otcs @xcite , it appears to be more general since here , the temporal dependance is explicitly obtained .",
    "we start from the definition of the action of the otcs coupled to an interaction potential  : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lagrangian of the system @xcite  :    @xmath15 \\right ] -\\frac{% m^{\\ast } \\omega _ { 0}}{q}z(t)\\underline{\\dot{z}}\\left ( t\\right )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the large quality factor , we assume that a typical temporal solution is on the form  : @xmath16 \\text { , }   \\label{equfonctionharmonique}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to be slowly varying functions with time compared to the period @xmath19 .",

    "while among the trial functions solutions that can be chosen the present one is not the more general , the principle of least action ensures that functionals of this type are the best .",
    "the equations of motion in amplitude and phase of the otcs are obtained by considering the following coarse - grained operation .",
    "let s assume a long duration @xmath22 with @xmath23 and calculate the action as a sum of small pieces of duration @xmath24  : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the mean lagrangian during one period and  appears as an effective lagrangian for a large time scale compared to the period .",
    "owing to the quasi - stationary behavior of the amplitude and the phase over the period , the effective lagrangian is calculated by keeping them constant during the integration .",
    "the calculations give  : @xmath27 -\\frac{k_{c}a^{2}}{4}+\\frac{\\mathcal{f}_{exc}a\\cos \\left ( \\varphi \\right ) } { 2}-\\frac{1}{t}\\int_{0}^{t}v_{int}\\left [ z\\left ( t\\right ) \\right ] dt \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{m^{\\ast } \\omega _ { 0}}{2q}\\left [ a\\underline{\\dot{a}}\\cos \\left ( \\varphi -\\underline{\\varphi } \\right ) -a\\underline{a}\\left ( \\omega + % \\underline{\\dot{\\varphi}}\\right ) \\sin \\left ( \\underline{\\varphi } -\\varphi \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the effective lagrangian is now a function of the new generalized coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath28 and their associated generalized velocities @xmath29 , @xmath30 . at this point , remembering that the period is small regardless to @xmath22 during which the total action is evaluated , the continuous expression of the action is  : @xmath31 where the measure @xmath32 is such that @xmath33 .",

    "for large values of @xmath55 , e.g. when the surface is far from the otcs ( point k ) , the non - linear effects are negligible and the peak keeps a well - defined lorentzian shape ( see equ.[equuapprochevar ] with @xmath68 ) . when the otcs is approached towards the surface , because the interaction is attractive , the resonance peak starts to distort towards the low frequencies . the distortion of the peak increases as @xmath55 decreases . in the vicinity of the resonance , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and for small values of @xmath55 the branches @xmath63 and",

    "the drive frequency is fixed to @xmath71  in fig.[figcartapping ] . with the parameters used , at @xmath72 the oscillations properties are nearly identical to those at @xmath55 infinite .",
    "when the peak starts to distort the amplitude and the phase ( not shown ) vary ( l ) . in the present example , because @xmath71 is chosen below the resonance , the amplitude first increases .",
    "when the otcs is further approached it reaches an unstable branch ( m ) and jumps to the stable branch ( n ) such that the bistable structure of the oscillator can be experimentally observed . at a closer distance , the peak further distorts and the amplitude is reduced since it follows the variations of @xmath63 ( point o on fig.[figcartapping ] ) . then , when the oscillator is retracted , it follows the upper stable branch until the resonance value corresponds to the fixed frequency @xmath71 ( point p on fig.[figcartapping ] ) and then jumps down to the lower stable branch .",
    "the curve exhibits a hysteresis cycle ( points m , n , p and l ) . on the figs.[figreso ] _ _  _ _ and [ figcartapping ] , the branches that are supposed unstable are shown with dashed lines .      using equ.[equuapprochevar ]",
    ",  the resonance frequency shift as a function of the distance @xmath55 is obtained by setting @xmath73 .",

    "_  _ _ and [ figcartapping ]",
    ". following the previous discussion about the stability of the different parts of the resonance peak during the distortion , since the measure is performed as a function of @xmath55 with @xmath73 , no bistable behavior can be observed .",

    "nevertheless , note that it should exist only one branch of variation for the frequency shift which is defined from the condition @xmath73 . but two branches are obtained as a consequence of the two solutions @xmath77 . when the peak is distorted , the branches @xmath60 and @xmath63 become very close as @xmath6 becomes large ( see for instance , fig.[figreso ] with @xmath78 ) .",
    "therefore even with an oscillation amplitude kept constant , question rises about the ability of the otcs to remain on the same branch .",
    "qualitatively , one may expect that around @xmath79 ,  the branch @xmath60 is unstable and @xmath80 is stable ( see fig.[figreso ] ) .",
    "if this is true , any small fluctuation of the oscillation amplitude might produce a jump from one branch to the other one as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the branch @xmath60 seems to be unstable , a jump to this branch should lead to an abrupt decrease of the amplitude , which in turn might produce an apparent abrupt decrease of the quality factor . because such a jump should show accidents , both on the resonance frequency shift curve and on the damping signal , accidents which are , in most cases , not observed ,",
    "it becomes useful to determine more accurately the stability of the two branches .",
    "the main aim of the variational method is to define a theoretical frame describing at the same time the evolution of all the variables  : @xmath51 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath55 of the otcs dynamics .",
    "thus , it becomes useless to discuss about the stability of each kind of branch for the two dynamic modes since the stability of a given couple @xmath83 , or @xmath84 as a function of @xmath55 can be deduced for any other couple .",
    "the discussion will be made on the branches of the resonance peak .",
    "the stability of the branches @xmath85 of the resonance peak ( see equ.[equuapprochevar ] ) is obtained from equations of motion of the otcs ( see equ.[equequationmouvementadim ] ) .",
    "these equations are linearized around the stationary solution which will be now identified by the index `` @xmath86 '' . at this stage",

    "writing into a four dimensions matrix the linearized system corresponding to the generalized coordinates @xmath83 and their associated generalized velocities @xmath87 , we extract the eigenvalues and discuss the stability as a function of the sign , negative ( stable solution ) or positive ( unstable solution ) , of their real part .",
    "the calculations are detailed in the appendix .",
    "the stability criterion for each one of the two branches is given by the following inequation ( see equ.[equinequstabil ] )  :    @xmath88    @xmath89 is proportional to @xmath49 ( see appendix , equ.[equdelta ] ) ,  thus characterizes the non - linear attractive coupling term . solving the associated equality gives the critical branch @xmath90 whose location regardless @xmath85 defines the stability of each branch .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath90 has no simple expression .",
    "therefore the stability condition [ equconditionstabilite1 ] can not be exploited as is .",
    "nevertheless a numerical routine allows to get its main features .",
    "the fig.[figstabilitebranches]_(a ) _  shows the distortion of the resonance peak and the critical branch @xmath90 numerically computed  for each branch .",

    "therefore it s worth discussing the stability as a function of the local curvature of the branches @xmath85 and so introducing their derivative @xmath95 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the inequation [ equconditionstabilite1 ] can be summarized as follow  :    @xmath96    the aim of this former expression is to exhibit an explicit and particularly simple dependence of the stability of the branches as a function of their derivative  :    @xmath97 for the @xmath63 branch , @xmath98 being always negative and the associated value of the phase being always defined beyond @xmath99{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ( see section [ subsectionresonancepeak ] ) , thus @xmath100 , the criterion @xmath101 implies that the @xmath63 branch is always stable , whatever the value of @xmath102 .",

    ", @xmath60 is locally unstable and the instability is precisely located where the infinite tangent appears . on the upper part of the resonance peak , the curvature of @xmath60 changes again and @xmath104 ( see fig.[figstabilitebranches]_(c ) _ ) , implying that it is again a locally stable domain .",
    "thus the branch @xmath60 exhibits two stable domains and one unstable .",
    "note also that the resonance condition is deduced from @xmath109 which implies @xmath110 .",

    "the previous criterions allow to conclude to the stability of the otcs for each dynamic mode .",
    "it was shown that , for an attractive coupling , the branch @xmath63 was always stable and that the instability was controlled by @xmath60 . for frequencies lower than the resonance ( branch @xmath60 ) ,",
    "when the tangent @xmath106 is positive , the branch is stable .",
    "thus , there is a small domain close to the resonance value for which the @xmath60 branch remains stable .    for the tapping",

    ", the result of the present work shows that @xmath63 is always stable but that also a small domain of @xmath60 around the resonance value remains stable .",
    "if the resonance value would have been located at the point where @xmath106 is infinite , an infinitely small fluctuation would have been able to generate a catastrophic behavior like large variations of the oscillation amplitude and lead to an abrupt increase of the damping signal as previously discussed and suggested in ref.@xcite .    nevertheless , the size of the @xmath60 stable domain is @xmath6 dependant .",
    "the more the @xmath6 factor is large , the more the size of the domain is reduced .",
    "the fig.[figqeffect ]  illustrates the reduction of the size of the domain for @xmath116 and @xmath117 . with @xmath117 ,",
    "the size of the domain is so weak that it nearly no appears on the scale of the figure . as a consequence ,",
    "even if the previous discussion may help to understand why abrupt increases of the damping signal do not systematically occur , question remains unclear for the very high @xmath6 factors that can be obtained in ultra - high vacuum @xmath118 . at this step ,",
    "it s worth giving orders of magnitude . during a nc - afm experiment ,",

    "in addition , since the ability of the electronic loop to control the oscillating behavior depends on the value of the quality factor @xcite , the reduction of the domain of stability might not be a key parameter .",
