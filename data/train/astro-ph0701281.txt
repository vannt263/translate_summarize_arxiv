    "since their discovery in 1969 @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been well studied at many wavelengths . although various open questions remain on their nature , there is almost universal agreement that the basic mechanism is an expanding relativistic fireball , that the radiation is beamed , that the prompt emission is due to internal shocks and that the afterglow arises from external shocks .",
    "it is likely that lorentz factors of a few hundred are involved , with the radiating particles , either electrons or protons , being accelerated to very high energies .",
    "grbs are sub - classified into two categories , long and short bursts , based on the timescale over which 90% of the prompt gamma - ray emission is detected .",
    "recently , the swift grb explorer @xcite has revealed that many grbs have associated x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "these flares have been detected between 10@xmath2s and 10@xmath3s after the initial prompt emission and have been found to have fluences ranging from a small fraction of , up to a value comparable to , that contained in the prompt grb emission .",
    "this x - ray flare emission has been postulated to arise from a number of different scenarios , including late central engine activity where the grb progenitor remains active for some time after , or re - activates after , the initial explosion @xcite and refreshed shocks which occur when slower moving shells ejected by the central engine in the prompt phase catch up with the afterglow shock at late times @xcite . for short",
    "grbs , shock heating of a binary stellar companion has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the x - ray flares are the result of prolonged central engine activity , refreshed shocks or some other mechanism @xcite .",
    "a very high energy ( vhe ; e @xmath0100gev ) component of this x - ray flare emission has also been predicted @xcite .    within the standard fireball shock scenario @xcite ,",
    "many models have been proposed which predict emission at and above gev energies during both the prompt and afterglow phases of the grb .",
    "these have been summarized by @xcite , and references therein , and include leptonic models in which gamma rays are produced by electron self - inverse - compton emission from the internal shocks or from the external forward or reverse shocks .",
    "other models predict gamma rays from proton synchrotron emission or photomeson cascade emission in the external shock or from a combination of proton synchrotron emission and photomeson cascade emission from internal shocks .",
    "although grb observations are an important component of the program at many vhe observatories , correlated observations at these short wavelengths remain sparse even though tantalizing and inherently very important .",
    "the sparsity of observations of grbs at energies above 10mev is dictated not by lack of interest in such phenomena , or the absence of theoretical predictions that the emission should occur , but by the experimental difficulties .",
    "for the observation of photons of energies above 100gev , only ground - based telescopes are available at present .",
    "these ground - based telescopes fall into two broad categories , air shower arrays and atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( of which the majority are imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , or iacts ) .",
    "the air shower arrays , which have wide fields of view making them particularly suitable for grb searches , are relatively insensitive .",
    "there are several reports from these instruments of possible tev emission .",
    "@xcite reported possible vhe emission at _ e _ @xmath0 16 tev from grb920925c . while finding no individual burst which is statistically significant , the tibet - as@xmath4 collaboration found an indication of 10tev emission in a stacked analysis of 57 bursts @xcite .",
    "the milagro collaboration reported on the detection of an excess gamma - ray signal during the prompt phase of grb970417a with the milagrito detector @xcite . in all of these cases however , the statistical significance of the detection is not high enough to be conclusive .",
    "in addition to searching the milagro data for vhe counterparts for 25 satellite - triggered grbs @xcite , the milagro collaboration conducted a search for vhe transients of 40 seconds to 3 hours duration in the northern sky @xcite .",
    "no evidence for vhe emission was found from either of these searches and upper limits on the vhe emission from grbs were derived .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , particularly those that utilize the imaging technique , are inherently more flux - sensitive than air shower arrays and have better energy resolution but are limited by their small fields of view ( 3 - 5@xmath5 ) and low duty cycle ( @xmath17% ) . in the burst and transient source explorer @xcite era ( 1991 - 2000 )",
    ", attempts at grb monitoring were limited by slew times and uncertainty in the grb source position @xcite .",
    "swift , the first of the next generation of gamma - ray satellites which will include agile ( astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ) and the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , is beginning to provide arcminute localizations so that iacts are no longer required to scan a large grb error box in order to achieve full coverage of the possible emission region .",
    "the work in this paper covers the time period prior to the launch of the swift satellite .",
    "the minimum detectable fluence with an iact , such as the whipple 10 m , in a ten second integration is @xmath610@xmath7erg@xmath8 ( 5 photons of 300gev in 5x10@xmath9cm@xmath2 collection area ) .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath0100 better than glast will achieve ( 3 photons of 10gev in 10@xmath11cm@xmath2 collection area ) .",
    "this ignores the large solid angle advantage of a space telescope and the possible steepening of the observable spectrum because of the inherent emission mechanism and the effect of intergalactic absorption by pair production .",
    "there have been many predictions of high energy grb emission in and above the gev energy range @xcite ; also see @xcite and references therein .",
    "until agile and glast are launched , the grb observations that were made by the egret experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) will remain the most constraining in the energy range from 30mev to 30gev .",
    "although egret was limited by a small collection area and large dead time for grb detection , it made sufficient detections to indicate that there is a prompt component with a hard spectrum that extends at least to 100mev energies .",
    "the average spectrum of four bursts detected by egret ( grbs910503 , 930131 , 940217 & 940301 ) did not show any evidence for a cutoff up to 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the relative insensitivity of egret was such that it was not possible to eliminate the possibility that all grbs had hard components @xcite .",
    "egret also detected an afterglow component from grb940217 that extended to 18gev for at least 1.5 hours after the prompt emission indicating that a high - energy spectral component can extend into the gev band for a long period of time , at least for some grbs @xcite .",
    "the spectral slope of this component is sufficiently flat that its detection at still higher energies may be possible @xcite .",
    "@xcite attribute this emission to the combination of prompt mev radiation from internal shocks with a more prolonged gev inverse compton component from external shocks .",
    "it is also postulated that this emission could be the result of inverse compton scattering of x - ray flare photons @xcite .",
    "although somewhat extreme parameters must be assumed , synchrotron self - compton emission from the reverse shock is cited as the best candidate for this gev emission by @xcite , given the spectral slope that was recorded .",
    "this requirement of such extreme parameters naturally explains the lack of grbs for which such a high energy component has been observed .",
    "@xcite postulate that some grb explosions occur inside pulsar wind bubbles .",
    "in such scenarios , afterglow electrons upscatter pulsar wind bubble photons to higher energies during the early afterglow thus producing gev emission such as that observed in grb940217 .",
    "the grb observational data are extraordinarily complex and there is no complete and definitive explanation for the diversity of properties observed .",
    "it is important to establish whether there is , in general , a vhe component of emission present during either the prompt or afterglow phase of the grb . understanding the nature of such emission",
    "will provide important information about the physical conditions of the emission region .",
    "one definitive observation of the prompt or afterglow emission could significantly influence our understanding of the processes at work in grb emission and its aftermath .    in this paper ,",
    "the grbs observed with the whipple 10 m gamma - ray telescope in response to hete-2 and integral notifications are described .",
    "the search for vhe emission is restricted to times on the order of hours after the grb . in section",
    "[ observe ] , the observing strategy , telescope configuration , and data analysis methods used in this paper are described .",
    "the properties of the grbs observed and their observation with the whipple telescope are described in section  [ grbs ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ resultsanddiscussion ] , the results are summarized and their implications discussed in the context of some theoretical models that predict vhe emission from grbs . the sensitivity of future instruments such as veritas to grbs is also discussed .",
    "the observations presented here were made with the 10 m gamma - ray telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory . constructed in 1968 , the telescope has been operated as an iact since 1982 @xcite . in september 2005 , the observing program at the 10 m was redefined and the instrument was dedicated solely to the monitoring of tev blazars and the search for vhe emission from grbs . located on mount hopkins approximately 40 km south of tucson in southern arizona at an altitude of 2300 m , the telescope consists of 248 hexagonal mirror facets mounted on a 10 m spherical dish with an imaging camera at its focus .",
    "the front - aluminized mirrors are mounted using the davies - cotton design @xcite .",
    "the imaging camera consists of 379 photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) arranged in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "a plate of light - collecting cones is mounted in front of the pmts to increase their light - collection efficiency .",
    "a pattern - sensitive trigger @xcite , generates a trigger whenever three adjacent pmts register a signal above a level preset in the constant fraction discriminators .",
    "the pmt signals for each triggering event are read out and digitized using charge - integrating analog to digital converters . in this way ,",
    "a map of the amount of charge in each pmt across the camera is recorded for each event and stored for offline analysis .",
    "the telescope triggers at a rate of @xmath12hz ( including background cosmic ray triggers ) when pointing at high ( @xmath050@xmath5 ) elevation .",
    "although sensitive in the energy range from 200gev to 10tev , the peak response energy of the telescope to a crab - like spectrum during the observations reported upon here was approximately 400gev .",
    "this is the energy at which the telescope is most efficient at detecting gamma rays and is subject to a 20% uncertainty .",
    "burst notifications at the whipple telescope for the observations described here were received via email from the global coordinates network @xcite . when a notification email arrived , the grb location and time were extracted and sent to the telescope tracking control computer .",
    "an audible alarm sounded to alert the observer of the arrival of a burst notification .",
    "if at sufficient elevation , the observer approved the observations and the telescope was commanded to slew immediately to the location of the grb .",
    "the whipple telescope slews at a speed of 1@xmath5s@xmath13 and therefore can reach any part of the visible sky within three minutes .",
    "seven different grb locations were observed with the whipple 10 m telescope between november 2002 and april 2004 .",
    "these observations are summarized in table  [ grb_summary ] . at the time these data were taken ,",
    "the point spread function of the whipple telescope was approximately 0.1@xmath5 which corresponds to the field of view of one pmt .",
    "the positional offsets for the grb observations ( see table  [ observations_and_results ] ) were all less than this so a conventional `` point source '' analysis was performed .",
    "the data were analyzed using the imaging technique and analysis procedures pioneered and developed by the whipple collaboration @xcite . in this method , each image is first cleaned to exclude the signals from any pixels that are most likely the result of noise .",
    "the cleaned images are then characterized by calculating and storing the first , second , and third moments of the light distribution in each image .",
    "the parameters and this procedure are described elsewhere @xcite . since",
    "gamma - ray images are known to be compact and elliptical in shape , while those generated by cosmic ray showers tend to be broader with more fluctuations , cuts can be derived on the above parameters which reject approximately 99.7% of the background images while retaining over 50% of those generated by gamma - ray showers .",
    "these cuts are optimized using data taken on the crab nebula which is used as the standard candle in the tev sky .",
    "two different modes of observation are employed at the whipple telescope , `` _ on - off _ '' and `` _ tracking _ '' @xcite .",
    "the choice of mode depends upon the nature of the target .",
    "the grb data presented here were all taken in the _ tracking _ mode .",
    "unlike data taken in the _ on - off _ mode , scans taken in the _ tracking _ mode do not have independent control data which can be used to establish the background level of gamma - ray like events during the scan .",
    "these control data are essential in order to estimate the number of events passing all cuts which would have been detected during the scan in the absence of the candidate gamma - ray source . in order to perform this estimate ,",
    "a tracking ratio is calculated by analyzing `` darkfield data '' @xcite .",
    "these consist of _ off - source _ data taken in the _ on - off _ mode and of observations of objects found not to be sources of gamma rays .",
    "a large database of these scans is analyzed and in this way , the background level of events passing all gamma - ray selection criteria can be characterized as a function of zenith angle . since the grb data described in this paper were taken at elevations between 50@xmath5 and 80@xmath5 , a large sample of darkfield data ( @xmath1 233 hours ) spanning a similar zenith angle range was analyzed so that the background during the gamma - ray burst data runs could be estimated .",
    "this paper concentrates on the grb observations made in response to hete-2 and integral triggers with the whipple 10 m gamma - ray telescope ; observations made in response to swift triggers are the subject of a separate paper @xcite . when the grb data were filtered to remove observations made at large zenith angles , during inferior weather conditions , and of positions later reported to be the result of false triggers or to have large positional errors , the data from observations of seven grb locations remained .",
    "these grbs took place between ut dates 021112 and 040422 ; two have redshifts derived from spectral measurements , one has an estimated redshift and four lie at unknown distances .",
    "five of the sets of grb follow - up observations were carried out in response to triggers from the high energy transient explorer 2 ( hete-2 ; @xcite ) while two sets of observations were triggered by the international gamma - ray astrophysical laboratory ( integral ; @xcite ) . in the remainder of this section , the properties of each of the grbs observed and",
    "the results of these observations are presented .",
    "a summary of the grb properties is given in table  [ grb_summary ] while the observations taken at the whipple observatory are summarized in table  [ observations_and_results ] .",

    "these are plotted for each of the grbs in figure  [ fig::upperlimits ] .",
    "the usefulness of the upper limits presented here is limited by the fact that five of the grbs occurred at unmeasured redshifts thus making it impossible to infer the effects of the infrared background light on those observations .",
    "in addition to this , the earliest observation was not made at whipple until 3.68 hours after the prompt grb emission .",
    "although the whipple 10 m telescope is capable of beginning grb observations less than 2 minutes after receiving notification , a number of factors , including notifications arriving during daylight and delays in the distribution of the grb locations , delayed the commencement of the grb observations presented here .",

    "one of the main obstacles for vhe observations of grbs is the distance scale .",
    "pair production interactions of gamma rays with the infrared photons of the extragalactic background light attenuate the gamma - ray signal thus limiting the distance over which vhe gamma rays can propagate . recently however , the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes have detected the blazar pg1553 + 113 @xcite .",
    "the redshift of this object is not known but there are strong indications that it lies at _ z_@xmath00.25 , possibly as far away as _",
    "this could represent a large increase in distance to the most distant detected tev source , revealing more of the universe to be visible to tev astronomers than was previously thought .",
    "although grbs lie at cosmological distances , many have been detected at redshifts accessible to vhe observers .",
    "of the grbs studied here , only 2 had spectroscopic redshifts measured while the redshift of one was estimated by @xcite using an improved version of the redshift estimator of @xcite .",
    "since all of the grbs discussed here were long bursts , it is likely that their redshifts are of order 1 . due to the unknown redshifts of most of the bursts and",
    "the uncertainty in the density of the extragalactic background light , the effects of the absorption of vhe gamma rays by the infrared background light have not been included here .",
    "@xcite analyzed the late time light curve of grb030329 and find that the large variability observed at several times ( t=1.3-@xmath11.7 days , @xmath12.4 - 2.8 days , @xmath13.1 - 3.5 days and at @xmath14.9 - 5.7 days ) after the burst is most likely the result of refreshed shocks .",
    "these time intervals have been highlighted in the top panel of figure  [ grb030329-lightcurve ] and it can be seen that some of the observations taken at whipple occurred during these times thus imposing upper limits on the vhe emission during these refreshed shocks . since grb030329 occurred at a low redshift ( @xmath210.1685 ) , it is possible that the effects of infrared absorption on any vhe emission component may not have been significant enough to absorb all vhe photons over the energy range to which whipple is sensitive .",
    "figure  [ ultimelog ] shows these scan - by - scan upper limits as a function of time since the prompt grb emission .",
    "also plotted are the predicted fluxes at various times after the grb by @xcite and @xcite at @xmath1 400gev , and by @xcite at 250gev . although the peak response energy of the whipple telescope at the time of these observations was 400gev , it still had sensitivity , albeit somewhat reduced , at 250gev .",
    "@xcite predict a delayed gev component in the grb afterglow phase from the inverse - compton up - scattering on external shock electrons .",
    "the duration of such a component is predicted to be up to a few hours , softening with time .",
    "@xcite investigated the different radiation mechanisms in grb afterglows and identified parameter - space regimes in which different spectral components dominate .",
    "they found that the inverse - compton gev photon component is likely to be significantly more important than a possible proton synchrotron or electron synchrotron component at these high energies .",
    "the predictions of @xcite for vhe emission at different times after a typical `` regime ii '' burst are shown by squares on figure  [ ultimelog ] .",
    "although the observations presented here do not constrain these predictions , the sensitivity is close to that required to detect the emission predicted .",
    "a recent analysis of archival data from the egret calorimeter has found a multi - mev spectral component in the prompt phase of grb941017 , that is distinct from the lower energy component @xcite .",
    "this high energy component appeared between 10s and 20s after the start of the grb and had a roughly constant flux with a relatively hard spectral slope for @xmath1200s .",
    "this observation is difficult to explain within the standard synchrotron model , thus indicating the existence of new phenomena .",
    "@xcite investigated possible scenarios for this high energy spectral component and found that most models fail .",
    "they concluded that the best candidate for the emission mechanism is synchrotron self - compton emission from the reverse shock and predicted that a bright optical transient , similar to that observed in grb990123 , should accompany this high energy component .",
    "@xcite explain this high energy tail as emission from the forward shock electrons in the early afterglow phase .",
    "these electrons inverse - compton scatter the optical photons that are emitted by the reverse shock electrons resulting in powerful vhe emission for 100s to 200s after the burst as indicated by the lines on figure  [ ultimelog ] .",
    "although the observations presented here did not commence early enough after the prompt grb emission to constrain such models , the sensitivity of the whipple telescope is such that the vhe emission predicted by these models would be easily detectable for low redshift bursts .",
    "the prediction of @xcite for vhe emission 5 x 10@xmath22s after the burst from the combination of external compton emission ( the relativistic electrons behind the afterglow shock upscatter the plerion radiation ) and synchrotron self - compton emission ( the electrons accelerated in the afterglow emit synchrotron emission and then upscatter this emission to the vhe regime ) is indicated by a star on figure  [ ultimelog ] .",
    "the emission is predicted to have a cutoff at @xmath1250gev due to pair production of the high energy photons with the radiation field of the pulsar wind bubble . for afterglows with an external density similar to that of the inter - stellar medium , photons of up to 1tev are possible .",
    "it can be seen that , although the upper limits presented here are below the predicted flux from @xcite , the observations at whipple took place after this emission was predicted to have occurred . had data taking at whipple commenced earlier , the emission predicted by these authors should have been detectable for nearby grbs .",
    "@xcite investigated the interactions of gev and higher energy photons in grb fireballs and their surroundings for the prompt phase of the grb .",
    "they predict that high energy photons escaping from the fireball will interact with infrared and microwave background photons to produce delayed secondary photons in the gev - tev range .",
    "although observations of the prompt phase of grbs are difficult with iacts since they are pointed instruments with small fields of view which must therefore be slewed to respond to a burst notification , observations in time to detect the delayed emission are possible .",
    "there are many emission models which predict significant vhe emission during the afterglow phase of a grb either related to the afterglow emission itself or as a vhe component of the x - ray flares that have been observed in many swift bursts .",
    "@xcite analyzed 40 swift bursts which had narrow - field instrument data within 10 minutes of the trigger and found that @xmath150% had late ( t@xmath0t90 ) x - ray flares .",
    "if the bulk of the radiation comes via synchrotron radiation as is usually supposed , then by analogy with other systems with similar properties ( supernova remnants , active galactic nuclei jets ) , it is natural to suppose that there must also be an inverse compton component by which photons are boosted into the gev - tev energy range .",
    "this process is described by @xcite who discuss the relationship between the energy at which the high energy cutoff occurs , the bulk lorentz factor and the size of the emission region .",
    "a high energy emission component due to inverse compton emission has also been considered in detail for grb afterglows by @xcite ; the predicted flux at gev - tev energies is comparable to that near the peak of the radiation in the afterglow synchrotron spectrum .",
    "only direct observations can confirm whether this is so .",
    "@xcite predict that the @xmath1300 gev photons from the prompt grb phase will interact with background ir photons , making delayed high energy emission undetectable unless the intergalactic magnetic fields are extremely small .",
    "the swift grb explorer has shown that @xmath150% of grbs have one or more x - ray flares .",
    "these flares have been detected up to 10@xmath3s ( @xmath128 hours ) after the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "indeed , the delayed gamma - ray component detected in batse bursts @xcite may also be associated with this phenomenon .",
    "recently , @xcite have predicted vhe emission coincident in time with the x - ray flare photons . in this model ,",
    "if the x - ray flares are caused by late central engine activity , the vhe photons are produced from inverse compton scattering of the x - ray flare photons from forward shock electrons .",
    "if the x - ray flares originate in the external shock , vhe photons can be produced from synchrotron self - compton emission of the x - ray flare photons with the electrons which produced them .",
    "should vhe emission be detected from a grb coincident with x - ray flares , the time profile of the vhe emission could be used to distinguish between these two origins of the x - ray flares .",
    "no evidence for delayed vhe gamma - ray emission was seen from any of the grb locations observed here and upper limits have been placed on the vhe emission at various times after the prompt grb emission . although there are no reports of the detection of x - ray flares or delayed x - ray emission from any of these grbs , it is likely that such emission was present in at least some of them given the frequency with which it has been detected in grbs observed by swift . indeed , the light curve of grb030329 shows large variability amplitude a few days after the burst and , as shown in figure  [ grb030329-lightcurve ] , whipple observations were taken during these episodes . apart from this ,",
    "a measured redshift is only available for one of the other bursts observed here and it is possible that the remaining five occurred at distances too large to be detectable in the vhe regime .",
    "@xcite reported on an unusual grb ( grb031203 ) that was much less energetic than average .",
    "its similarity , in terms of brightness , to an earlier grb ( grb980425 ) suggests that the nearest and most common grb events have not been detected up until now because grb detectors were not sensitive enough @xcite .",
    "most grbs that have been studied up until now lie at cosmological distances .",
    "they generate a highly collimated beam of gamma rays ensuring that they are powerful enough to be detectable at large distances . both of the less powerful grbs detected to date occurred at considerably lower redshifts ; grb980425 at _ z_=0.0085 and grb031203 at _ z_=0.1055 .",
    "although @xcite conclude that up until now , grb detectors have only detected the brightest grbs and that the nearest and most common grb events have been missed because they are less highly collimated and energetic , @xcite argue that the observations of grb031203 can indeed be the result of off - axis viewing of a typical , powerful grb with a jet",
    ". should future observations prove there to be a closer , less powerful population of grbs , these would be prime targets for iacts .    in the past year , the whipple observatory 10 m telescope has been used to carry out follow - up observations on a number of grbs detected by the swift grb explorer .",
    "the analysis of these observations will be the subject of a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) is currently under construction at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona .",
    "two of the four telescopes are fully operational and it is anticipated that the four - telescope array will be operational by the end of 2006 .",
    "grb observations will receive high priority and , when a grb notification is received , their rapid follow - up will take precedence over all other observations .",
    "the veritas telescopes can slew at 1@xmath5s@xmath13 thus enabling them to reach any part of the visible sky in less than 3 minutes .",
    "when an acceptable ( i.e. at high enough elevation ) grb notification is received during observing at veritas , an alarm sounds to alert the observer that a grb position has arrived . upon receiving authorization from the observer ,",
    "the telescope slews immediately to the position and data - taking begins .",
    "given that the maximum time to slew to a grb is 3 minutes , and that swift notifications can arrive within 30s of the grb , it is possible that veritas observations could begin as rapidly as 2 - 4 minutes after the grb , depending on its location with respect to the previous veritas target .",
    "as has been shown above , the whipple 10 m telescope is sensitive enough to detect the grb afterglow emission predicted by many authors . with its improved background rejection and greater energy range",
    ", veritas will be significantly more sensitive for grb observations than the whipple 10 m telescope .",
    "the veritas sensitivity for observations of different durations is shown in figure  [ veritas - sensitivity ] .",
    "based on the assumed rate of swift detections ( 100 year@xmath13 ) , the fraction of sky available to veritas , the duty - cycle at its site and the sun avoidance pointing of swift which maximizes its overlap with nighttime observations , it is anticipated that @xmath110 swift grbs will be observable each year with veritas .",
    "the authors would like to thank emmet roache , joe melnick , kevin harris , edward little , and all of the staff at the whipple observatory for their support .",
    "the authors also thank the anonymous referee for his / her comments which were very useful and improved the paper .",
