    "the hunt for the higgs boson is performed with great enthusiasm both at the fermilab tevatron and at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the higgs boson constitutes the last missing piece in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and could explain the generation of mass terms in the lagrange density .",
    "the latter is also true in many extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry .    in the recent years",
    "many higher order corrections to production and decay of the higgs boson have been computed .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the production cross section in gluon fusion have been considered in refs .",
    "the most recent computations within the sm that appeared in the end of 2009  @xcite describe the higgs boson production in gluon fusion at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) taking the finite top quark mass into account .",
    "an important outcome of these papers is the justification to use the effective theory ( built for the infinite top quark mass ) for the evaluation of the cross section as it was done in refs .",
    "@xcite . as long as one restricts the analysis to the top quark / squark sector it is suggestive that this conclusion also holds for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) since the corresponding calculation would have a similar structure . at nlo",
    "this has been demonstrated in refs .  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that it also holds at nnlo in situation when all supersymmetric particles are heavier than the top quark .",
    "note that we explicitly exclude the bottom quark / squark sector from our consideration since in that case the effective - theory approach as presented in this paper is not applicable .",
    "thus , our results only apply to small and moderate values of @xmath1 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , where the contribution of the bottom quark / squark sector is numerically negligible .",
    "the supersymmetric nlo correction to the gluon fusion process has been considered in various papers . in refs .",
    "@xcite the higgs boson production cross section and the decay rate have been computed in the effective theory framework and thus apply to higgs boson masses less than about 200  gev .",
    "the results have been confirmed by a ( numerical ) calculation in the full theory  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "it should be mentioned that the squark contribution has been considered separately in refs .",
    "furthermore , an estimate of the nnlo supersymmetric corrections was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) assuming that the nnlo corrections to the matching coefficient in the mssm and the sm are numerically of the same order .    in this paper",
    "we consider the strong interaction part of the mssm and evaluate the total production cross section of an intermediate mass higgs boson in the process of gluon fusion .",
    "as motivated above , we employ the effective theory obtained in the formal limit where all supersymmetric particles and the top quark are infinitely heavy , which leads to the lagrange density @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xmath4 is the coefficient function containing the remnant contributions of the heavy particles and @xmath5 is the effective operator .",
    "@xmath6 is the qcd lagrange density with five active flavours . in our case @xmath7",
    "denotes the light cp - even higgs boson of the mssm .",
    "@xmath8 is the gluonic field strength tensor of the standard five - flavour qcd and the superscript `` 0 '' indicates bare quantities .",
    "note that the renormalization of @xmath9 is of higher order in the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath5 is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we reproduce here the renormalization constant which in the @xmath10 scheme is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the space - time dimension and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 function of the standard five - flavour qcd with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . since @xmath17 , the coefficient function is renormalized with @xmath18 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we slightly redefine the coefficient function and the operator in order to have objects which are separately renormalization group invariant . introducing @xmath19 with @xmath20",
    "we may choose independently the `` soft '' and the `` hard '' renormalization scales .",
    "our following analysis of the higgs production cross section takes advantage of those properties of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that the lo piece of @xmath22 is not proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper we consider the strongly interacting part of the mssm and assume for simplicity the degenerate supersymmetric mass spectrum .",
    "the evaluation of the coefficient functions is performed within dimensional reduction ( dred )  @xcite where we follow refs .",
    "@xcite for the practical implementation .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we briefly revisit the sm and in particular discuss the effect of @xmath24 introduced above .",
    "we furthermore evaluate the sm coefficient function within dred which is a useful preparation for the susy qcd calculation .",
    "next , in section  [ sec::mssm ] we discuss the three - loop calculation of the mssm coefficient function which is used in section  [ sec::xsec ] to compute the cross section to nnlo .",
    "section  [ sec::concl ] contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the gluon fusion process has been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold : on the one hand we want to discuss the effect of @xmath24 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq::b5 ] ) on the numerical predictions , on the other hand we repeat the sm calculation in the framework of dred as a preparation for the calculation in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "the sm coefficient function expressed in terms of the on - shell top quark mass and the five - flavour strong coupling reads - dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "if not stated otherwise we have @xmath25 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath26 mass parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 introduced in section  [ sec::mssm].]@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) : @xmath29    \\bigg\\}\\ , ,    \\label{eq::c1sm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the number of massless quarks .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::xsecsm](a ) we show the production cross section @xmath31 for the lhc with the center - of - mass energy of 14  tev at lo , nlo and nnlo for @xmath32  gev  @xcite , computed with mstw08  @xcite parton distribution function ( pdf ) set .",
    "the chosen pdfs fix the values of @xmath33 to lo , nlo and nnlo accuracy used as the starting point in order to obtain the strong coupling for the other choices of the renormalization scale .",
    "the bands are obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath34 between @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite with @xmath37 as central value . for comparison",
    "we present the nnlo result computed with abkm09 pdfs  @xcite ( the dashed line ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the difference in the central values for the different pdfs is comparable to the uncertainty due to the scale variation .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     our following scenario is based on the so - called `` no - mixing '' scheme as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . keeping @xmath38 fixed",
    ", we vary @xmath39 , the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , between 200  gev and 1  tev , and compute the scalar higgs mass and the supersymmetric particle masses with softsusy  @xcite . averaging the masses of squark , stop and gluino , we obtain @xmath40  gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig::nomix_xsec ] we present the cross section computed in this scenario . here",
    "the higgs boson mass varies from 114  gev to 117  gev , and that affects the sm cross section ( the dashed lines ) . compared to the previous plot , the variation of @xmath41 is more pronounced , reaching @xmath42 at the left boundary , while for the larger values of @xmath39 this ratio approaches 1 .",
    "the genuine supersymmetric corrections ( arising from terms of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq::c1dr ] ) ) are small . again",
    ", the @xmath0-factors are very stable in the whole range of @xmath39 and are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in this letter we have computed supersymmetric nnlo susy - qcd corrections arising from the top quark / squark sector to the matching coefficient determining the higgs - gluon coupling in the effective theory .",
    "regularization was done in dred with the help of the so - called @xmath46 scalars which made the matching to the five - flavour qcd very delicate . in particular",
    ", we had to renormalize the mass of the @xmath46 scalar and its coupling to the higgs boson at one- and two - loop orders , respectively .",
    "the approximation investigated in this paper , assuming zero mixing in the stop sector , produces significant effects only when @xmath47 is small , @xmath48  tev .",
    "however , the effect of zero mixing on higgs mass together with the current experimental bounds on this mass exclude this possibility .",
    "we expect that a more general result , allowing for a large mixing angle , will not be so severely constrained , and enhancement of the cross section by as much as 50% ( as in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig::degen_xsec ] ) may be allowed .    analyzing the higher order corrections , in the mssm we observe the same pattern as in the sm : large nlo corrections which further increase at nnlo . for @xmath49",
    "tev the genuine supersymmetric corrections are suppressed and the difference from the sm is mainly due to the factor @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq::c1dr ] ) .",
    "however , the mssm @xmath0-factors are very similar to their sm counterparts .",
    "this confirms the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the complete nlo corrections to the matching coefficient and the nnlo calculation in the effective theory .",
    "our calculation has been performed in the limit of degenerate supersymmetric masses . in order to explore all interesting regions of the supersymmetric parameter space",
    "it would be necessary to relax this restriction . since a three - loop calculation with many different mass scales is currently not feasible it is more promising to employ a strategy based on asymptotic expansions which has been applied successfully to predict the lightest mssm higgs boson mass in ref .",
