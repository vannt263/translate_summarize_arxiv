    "modern quantum technologies can not neglect effects connected with the inevitable interaction with the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "several techniques allow us to take into account the influence of the system - environment interaction , such as those based on reduced dynamics @xcite , stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite or non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the most frequently used one is the reduced dynamics approach that leads to a dynamical map of the system of interest .",
    "the intensive study of the dynamical map recently revealed a plethora of features of open quantum systems dynamics , from which it is worth emphasising the markovian and non - markovian behaviour @xcite .",
    "markovianity is based on the property of either @xmath0-divisibility @xcite or @xmath1-divisibility @xcite of the corresponding dynamical map . with @xmath0-divisibility",
    ", we can associate a physical interpretation @xcite , namely , the distinguishability of quantum states during the evolution . for markovian behaviour",
    ", we monotonically lose `` information '' , which flows away to the environment , while for non - markovian behaviour this `` information '' may come back from the environment to the system .",
    "this is called _ backflow of the information_.    our work shows that we can not speak of the `` flow of information '' as a physical quantity .",
    "this was proposed in @xcite without deeper insight . according to @xcite the `` information '' that flows from the open system is transferred into environment or system - environment correlations .",
    "we demonstrate that `` information '' absorbed by the environment might be greater then the one that has flown from the system ( we also refer to it as a leakage of `` information '' ) .",
    "therefore , we claim , that this quantity is ill - defined in a physical way .    during the procedure of the reduction ( that is necessary to obtain a quantum dynamical map ) ,",
    "we lose some information about the influence of the environment . in this paper",
    ", we propose a quantity that can measure the discrepancies between exact ( unitary ) dynamics and the reduced one ( i.e. dynamics of marginals ) .",
    "it is based on the relative entropy and as we show it can not be expressed in terms of the trace distance .    in the next section , we present basics concepts concerning reduced dynamics and distinguishability of the states .",
    "we show the lack of symmetry between reduced dynamics and introduce the relative entropy between exact and reduced dynamics . in section iii",
    ", we consider simple examples that clarify our approach . in the last section ,",
    "we conclude our work and pose some open questions .",
    "reduced dynamics @xmath2 of the system - environment evolution is defined as follows @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a state of the system living on hilbert space @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a state of the environment and @xmath7 is a unitary operation corresponding to the total system - environment evolution . to deal with a dynamical map ,",
    "one has to consider the initial system - environment state as a product state .",
    "usually , the state of the environment is omitted in the dynamical map .",
    "however , we keep it as a parametric dependence on our evolution . according to the stinespring theorem @xcite a dynamical map is completely positive ( cp ) , trace preserving ( tp ) and at the initial value it is the identity map , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 defines a legitimate physical process .",
    "we may use the same procedure to construct the reduced dynamics of the environment @xmath9 in contrast to the previous approach , we traced out the system and left only the environment .",
    "this dynamical map is also cptp with the identity map at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "let us recall a definition of markovian dynamics based on the distinguishability of the states @xcite , which was recently proven to be equivalent to the @xmath0-divisibility @xcite ( in this work we will limit ourselves to a standard definition from @xcite ) .",
    "first let us introduce the notion of trace distance .",
    "a trace distance between two states @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trace norm .",
    "it is a measure of distinguishability of the state . due to the fact ,",
    "that trace distance is contractive under the action of cptp , it may be used as a witness of non - markovianity .",
    "a dynamical map @xmath14 is said to be markovian if for all pairs of quantum states @xmath10 and @xmath11 and all times @xmath15 it satisfies @xmath16 if condition ( [ mark ] ) is violated , then the dynamics is called non - markovian .    according to the above definition",
    ", the trace distance is monotonically decreasing for markovian dynamics .",
    "this is interpreted as a leakage of the `` information '' from the system to the environment and hence discrimination of two quantum states is monotonically decreasing .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the information outside the system should be contained in one or both of the following :    1 .",
    "environment , 2 .   system - environment correlations .    moreover , `` information '' that leaked from the system supposed to be equal to `` information '' absorbed by the environment or available in correlations .",
    "let us introduce the time evolution of trace distance as @xmath17 in a similar way we may define the trace distance for the reduced dynamics of the environment as @xmath18 this definition is in accordance with ( [ dist ] ) and it should represent the absorbability of the `` information '' by the environment . in @xcite the `` information '' outside the system ( i.e. in the environment ) is defined as @xmath19 which is bounded by @xmath20where first two term on the right - hand side of this inequality are measure of system - environment correlations , while the last one is the above mentioned absorbability of the environment .",
    "let us observe that , if ( [ dist ] ) has the meaning of the `` information '' flow from the system outside ( environment and creation of correlations ) then ( [ distenv ] ) represents `` information '' absorbed by the environment and hence @xmath21 .    therefore , we should expect that @xmath22 @xmath23 and equality holds when correlations are not created .",
    "this would indicate , that the amount of `` information '' that leaked from the system was less then absorbed one .",
    "in general ( [ const ] ) does not hold .",
    "thus , we can not refer to the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 and even @xmath26 as a measures of the `` information '' , due to the fact , that they are not conserved .",
    "this is the reason , that we referred to `` information '' in quotation marks . in this work",
    "we examine the quantity that shows the difference between initial value of trace distance and sum of trace distances of the reduced dynamics @xmath27 we call this a trace distance difference .",
    "based on the investigation of ( [ ii ] ) , we may conclude , that a negative value indicates violation of conservation of information .",
    "all these effects are connected with information losses during the procedure of reduction .",
    "therefore , we need to know how to quantify them .      to have a better insight into the amount of information losses during the procedure of reduction , we propose the following quantity @xmath28 which is a relative entropy @xcite between exact ( unitary ) dynamics and tensor product of reduced dynamics ( dynamics of marginals ) , where @xmath29 one sees that @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a unitary acting on @xmath33 , which is a trivial case .",
    "otherwise , we have the measure of the departure from the exact unitary evolution or , in other words , the measure of losses of applying the reduction procedure .",
    "let us stress that we do not refer to ( [ ent ] ) as a measure of non - markovianity or system - environment correlations , but a measure of informational losses .",
    "usually , we do not have access to the environment , and we assume some fixed state @xmath34 . if we minimise ( [ ent ] ) over the states @xmath35 , then this state `` feels '' @xmath34 better than the others , i.e. that information losses is optimal for this kind of dynamics .",
    "consider a two - dimensional system interacting with a two - dimensional environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system - environment is of the following form @xmath36 where @xmath37 are @xmath38 and @xmath39 pauli matrices , respectively . with this hamiltonian",
    "we may associate the unitary matrix @xmath40 & 0 & 0 & -\\sin\\big [ f(t)\\big ] \\\\0 & \\cos\\big [ f(t)\\big ] & \\sin\\big [ f(t)\\big ] & 0 \\\\0 & -\\sin\\big [ f(t)\\big ] & \\cos\\big [ f(t)\\big ] & 0 \\\\\\sin\\big [ f(t)\\big ] & 0 & 0 & \\cos\\big [ f(t)\\big]\\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",

    "we choose the environmental state as @xmath47 for which @xmath48 and we get a random unitary dynamics of a qubit @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are strongly state dependent , and we may have various behaviours of those quantities . here",
    "we present results for two types of states :    1 .",
    "mutually orthogonal states , that according to @xcite are optimal .",
    "these states are of the following form @xmath51 @xmath52 2 .   randomly chosen pair of states ( referred as random states ) : @xmath53 @xmath54    a markovian semigroup is obtained for @xmath55 with the local - in - time generator of the following form @xmath56 we will consider here a case , when @xmath57 . for orthogonal states we have the trace distances given by the following formulas @xmath58 @xmath59 .",

    "then leakage ( fig.1 ( b ) the blue curve ) for all @xmath15 , therefore the trace distance difference is negative ( fig.1 ( b ) the green curve ) .",
    "this indicates that that the trace distance can not be understood as a measure of the `` information '' , due to lack of conservation law . for random states",
    ", we have at the beginning of the evolution faster absorbability then leakage , but as evolution progresses leakage starts to dominate absorbability ( fig .",
    "2 ( b ) the green curve  initially negative , then becomes positive ) .    because we are interested in the comparison between trace distance acting on different states and relative entropy on different states , hence we examine ( [ ents ] ) .",
    "we use the sum instead of the difference , due to the fact , that losses of information can not compensate each other .",
    "interestingly , the behaviour of relative entropy is regular ( in this case even qualitatively the same for different pair of states ( fig.1 ( a ) and fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) ) , which in general does not need to be true .",
    "as the evolution progresses we lose more and more information about the total dynamics .",

    "the difference may be even negative , which indicates that it can not be understood as a measure of information contained in the systems that is exchanged with the environment during the evolution .",
    "regardless of the absence of informational interpretation the trace distance is a great mathematical tool to decide whether a given map is @xmath0-divisible or not , i.e. it is a witness of non - markovianity .",
    "we introduce a measure of losses of the reduction procedure , which is quantified by the relative entropy of exact unitary dynamics and tensor product of reduced dynamics .",
    "this measure is state dependent , and we can minimise it to get the state that is least affected by the procedure of reduction .",
    "it would be worth investigating a behaviour of relative entropy for correlated system - environment states , in particular , entangled states .",
    "all our considerations show that when we neglect the environment by mere reduction we lose some amount of information about our evolution ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the procedure of reduction seems to be appropriate if we have no access to ( information about ) the environment .",
    "however , in many physical applications we can prepare our environment in a certain state ( for example thermal baths ) .",
    "therefore , it seems inappropriate to treat a `` partially known '' state as a `` completely unknown '' one and perform the partial trace .",
    "hence , this leads naturally to the following question : how may we substitute the procedure of reduction , to have smaller losses in the dynamics ?"
