    "spin - orbit interaction leads , in general , to a number of interesting transport phenomena , that enable generation and control of spin currents in a pure electrical manner .",
    "two of the most prominent examples are the spin hall and spin nernst effects .",
    "the former ( latter ) effect consists in generation of pure spin current flowing perpendicularly to an external electric field ( temperature gradient ) applied to the system .",
    "these effects play currently an essential role in the processes of electrical generation and detection of spin currents@xcite .",
    "for instance , the spin current can be used as origin of spin torque exerted on magnetic moments of a ferromagnet in a bilayer system consisting of a magnetic layer attached to a nonmagnetic one with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this torque , in turn , may induce magnetic dynamics and even can reverse magnetic moment of the magnetic layer when the spin current exceeds some critical value .",
    "another consequence of the spin - orbit interaction in a system with mobile electrons is the current - induced nonequilibrium spin polarization of conduction electrons .",
    "this effect was predicted theoretically in the 70s  @xcite for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rashba spin - orbit interaction , and then it was studied in various systems exhibiting spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "the current - induced spin polarization was also observed experimentally  @xcite , and currently it is attracting attention of many researchers  @xcite .",
    "the current - induced spin polarization can also arise in a magnetic system , when it includes spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in such a case the induced non - equilibrium spin polarization interacts with the local magnetization _ via _ exchange coupling and creates a torque exerted on the magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been also shown that not only external electric field , but also a temperature gradient may lead to spin - orbit driven spin polarization  @xcite .",
    "these observations initiated a wide interest in the field- and thermally - induced spin - orbit torques and new ways of magnetization switching , that could be alternative to the switching induced by spin transfer torques  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present theoretical results on the current - induced spin polarization of a magnetic 2deg with rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "such a system is a basic model of various magnetic semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the system consists of a 2deg deposited on a magnetic substrate and interacting with the substrate _ via _",
    "exchange interaction ( see also fig.1 ) . to calculate the current - induced spin polarization we use the matsubara green function formalism which enables description of the temperature variation of the induced spin polarization .",
    "we derive some general formulas for the polarization and also present numerical results .",
    "the induced spin polarization is shown to include generally a term due to berry curvature of the corresponding electron bands .",
    "similar terms also appear in the spin - orbit torques following from exchange interaction of the electrons and magnetic underlayer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model system and also present the theoretical formalism and derive general formulas for the current - induced spin polarization . in section 3",
    "we present analytical and numerical results in some specific situations ; first , we consider the nonequilibrium spin polarization in the absence of exchange field ( section 3 a ) , then we present results for exchange field oriented perpendicularly to the plane of 2deg ( section 3 b ) and for exchange field oriented in plane of 2deg and collinear ( perpendicular ) to the electric current , section 3c ( section 3 d ) . in section 4 we discuss the spin polarization in a general case of arbitrarily oriented exchange field . in section 5 , in turn , we consider relation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization with the berry curvature of the corresponding electronic bands .",
    "the induced spin - orbit torque is briefly discussed in section 6 , while summary and final conclusions are in section 7 .",
    "we consider a magnetized 2deg with rashba spin - orbit interaction , as shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the 2deg is assumed to be deposited on a ferromagnetic substrate which creates an effective exchange field acting on the electron gas .    .",

    "[ cispeodtheta_fig ] are required when considering magnetic dynamics induced by spin torque due to spin polarization .",
    "magnetic moment ( and thus also exchange field ) precesses then in space , and this time evolution is associated with time evolution of the spin polarization . in this paper , however , we do not consider dynamical properties and focus rather on evaluating spin polarization in static situations .",
    "recently h. kurebayashi et al .",
    "@xcite , based on experimental results , have proposed the anti - damping spin - orbit torque mediated by the berry phase  @xcite . in other words",
    ", they showed that the berry curvature gives rise to the spin - orbit torque in systems with broken inversion symmetry .",
    "our results given by eqs .",
    "( [ s_x])-([s_z ] ) show that when the exchange field is nonzero , the inversion symmetry is broken and the general expressions for the @xmath35 and @xmath130 components of the spin polarization contain terms that do not depend on relaxation rate , but are functions of the fermi - dirac distribution function instead of its derivative .",
    "thus , taking into account the notation well known in the context of the anomalous hall effect , we can rewrite eqs  ( [ s_x])-([s_z ] ) as follows : @xmath137 where the first term depends on the states in a close vicinity of the fermi level : @xmath138 $ ] , while the second term contains information from all electronic states : @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "now we show that the terms @xmath140 are related to the berry curvature .    to do this let us rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the following form : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath115 can be written as @xmath144 the berry curvature of the @xmath62-th ( @xmath145 ) band , @xmath146 , is defined as the rotation of the berry connection @xmath147 ( for details see refs ) . thus one can write @xmath148 .\\ ] ] combining eqs .",
    "( 28 ) to ( 30 ) we find for the berry curvature , @xmath149 taking the expression above into account , the berry phase related terms in the electrically generated spin polarization can be written as @xmath150 note , these terms disappear in the absence of exchange field .",
    "due to exchange interaction , the current induced spin polarization exerts a torque @xmath151 on the magnetic moment @xmath152 .",
    "this torque enters the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation for magnetic dynamics , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a unit vector along magnetic moment @xmath152 , @xmath155 is the effective magnetic field which includes external magnetic field , dipolar field , and anisotropy field , @xmath156 is the gilbert damping factor , and @xmath157 is the giro - magnetic factor .    to find the torque @xmath151 we write the coupling energy of the magnetic moment and induced spin polarization as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is defined as @xmath160 taking the above into account ,",
    "one can write the torque @xmath151 as a sum of a field - like torque @xmath161 and damping - like torque @xmath162 , @xmath163 these components can be written in terms of the spin - orbit field @xmath159 as @xmath164 for the field - like term , and @xmath165 for the damping - like term . since the spin polarization includes terms related to the berry curvature , the resulting spin - orbit torques include terms related to the berry curvature as well .",
    "using the matsubara green function method we have calculated current - induced spin polarization in a magnetized two - dimensional electron gas with the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the exchange field is shown to have a significant impact on the spin polarization .",
    "first , for some orientations of the exchange field , the component of spin polarization that appears in the absence of exchange field can be enhanced by the exchange field , while for other orientations this component can be suppressed .",
    "second , exchange field also generates the components of spin polarization which are absent in the limit of vanishing exchange field .",
    "we also note , that the states at the band edges may become localized due to disorder and the results may be not valid in the localization regime .",
    "analytical and/or numerical results have been presented in some special cases , when exchange field is oriented along current or perpendicular to current ( in - plane and perpendicular to the plane of 2deg in the latter case ) .",
    "numerical results have been also presented in a general case of arbitrary orientation of exchange field .",
    "we have found that the exchange field leads to terms in the spin polarization that can be related to the berry curvature of the corresponding electron bands .",
    "since the calculated spin polarization generates a torque which may induce dynamics of the magnetic moment , this torque includes terms related to the berry curvature as well .",
