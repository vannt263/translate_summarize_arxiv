    "supernova ( sn ) 2003gd was discovered by rev . bob evans on june 12.82 2003 ut ( jd 2452803.32 ) with an apparent magnitude of @xmath613.2 mag , situated on the southern spiral arm of m74 .",
    "the sn was soon confirmed by r. h. mcnaught on june 13.84 ut who gave a precise position of r. a. = @xmath7 , dec = + 15@xmath8 @xcite . @xcite",
    "obtained a near - infrared spectrum of the sn on june 13.46 ut showing broad pa@xmath9 and pa@xmath10 which are indicative of a supernova of type ii .",
    "@xcite confirmed 2003gd as a type ii with an optical spectrum and estimated that it was roughly 2 months post - explosion .",
    "owing to the relative proximity of m74 ( 9.3 mpc ; see  [ sec : d ] ) and its favourable inclination , a monitoring programme was initiated .",
    "m74 was also the host galaxy of the recent type ic sn  2002ap @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented early @xmath11 light curves and colour curves of sn  2003gd and compared them with those of sn  1999em .",
    "they photometrically classified 2003gd as a type ii - p sn and also gave estimates of the explosion date , 17th march 2003 , and of the line of sight reddening , @xmath12 . using ground based astrometric calibrations @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated the position of sn  2003gd on pre - discovery hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) images of m74 , suggesting possible candidates for the progenitor but both studies required follow - up _ hst _ images to determine the sn position with sufficient precision to unambiguously identify any precursor star .    after observing sn  2003gd with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) as part of our ongoing",
    "programme on supernova progenitors , we presented the discovery of a star which exploded as sn  2003gd @xcite .",
    "the progenitor star was also identified on pre - explosion gemini images and the combined @xmath13 magnitudes were used to estimate its intrinsic colour and luminosity .",
    "these were found to be consistent with those of a red supergiant , and comparison with stellar evolutionary tracks suggested that it had an initial main sequence mass of @xmath5 .",
    "this is only the third time that a progenitor of a genuinely confirmed sn has been identified and is the first apparently normal red supergiant to be associated with a sn of type ii - p .",
    "the determination of intrinsic colour and luminosity require the reddening and distance to be known .",
    "we summarised the results of our measurements for both of these quantities in @xcite and in this paper we present the full photometric and spectroscopic data set .",
    "given the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor star , which have long been assumed to be the progenitors of sne  ii - p , it is essential that the sn itself is studied and quantified .    in this paper",
    "we present extensive photometric and spectroscopic data of sn  2003gd in  [ sec : obs ] followed by an analysis of the photometry in  [ sec : epoch ] , where an explosion date is estimated .",
    "we estimate the reddening towards the supernova , using three different methods , in  [ sec : red ] and analyse the velocity evolution in  [ sec : expvel ] .",
    "the distance to m74 is not well known and as yet no cepheid distance exists .",
    "we attempt to improve the situation in  [ sec : dw ] by estimating the distance using two different methods and compiling all distances within the literature . using the distance",
    "found we then calculate the amount of @xmath14ni synthesised in the explosion in  [ sec : ni ] . in ",
    "[ sec : zamp ] the observed properties of sn  2003gd are compared to the semi - analytical model of @xcite and in  [ sec : diss ] we discuss the nature of the supernova and the implication for the progenitor .",
    "we then conclude in  [ sec : con ] . throughout this work we have assumed the galactic reddening laws of @xcite with @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath11 photometry was obtained shortly after discovery and covers a range of @xmath692 - 169 days after explosion with a few late - time epochs around 490 days .",
    "these data were collected from several telescopes : the 1.0 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) , the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) and the 3.5 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , all on la palma , and the 1.82 m copernico telescope ( cta ) at asiago , italy .",
    "the latest data were taken with unit telescope 1 ( ut1 ) , antu , of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , paranal , chile .",
    "a summary of these observations can be found in table [ tab : opphot ] as well as the results from the optical photometry .",
    "the jkt observations where taken with its @xmath16 site1 jag - ccd camera and were reduced using standard techniques within iraf .",
    "the frames were debiased and flat - fielded using twilight sky flats generally taken on the night of the observations . in some cases flats for our required filters",
    "were not available from that night and we employed the best set of flats closest in time to the supernova observations . an extensive photometric sequence of stars around m74 has been calibrated by @xcite originally intended for monitoring of sn  2002ap . on the jkt images",
    "there were normally nine stars suitable for calibration of the supernova magnitudes ( henden numbers 100 , 109 , 149 , 153 , 156 , 158 , 160 , 161 ) and these were used to determine the zero - points and transformation coefficients on each night . in some cases the telescope pointing was slightly different or the brightest stars in the sequence were saturated due to increased exposure time for the fading supernova and hence not all the standards could be used .",
    "a minimum of three standard stars were always available on each night .",
    "the @xmath11 magnitudes were obtained using aperture photometry and the errors are the standard deviations of the individual values of the supernova magnitudes determined from each calibration star .",
    "the int observations were taken with the wide field camera ( wfc ) at the prime focus .",
    "the wfc consists of 4 thinned eev 2k@xmath174k ccds and sn  2003gd and its calibration stars were placed on ccd4 of the mosaic .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard pipeline processing applied to all wfc images in the cambridge archive @xcite .",
    "images were taken with the harris @xmath18 filter and the sdss - like filters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we attempted to transform the @xmath19 and @xmath20 aperture magnitudes to the @xmath21 system of henden using 15 stars from the henden catalogue .",
    "we derived good fits between the instrumental magnitudes and the intrinsic @xmath22 and @xmath23 colours for the stars and tested these on four other stars in common to the henden and wfc catalogues .",
    "the transformations produced @xmath13 magnitudes which were accurate to a mean of 0.03 .",
    "however when we transformed the supernova ccd @xmath24 magnitudes to the @xmath21 system we got very unsatisfactory results . on 2003",
    "august 25 , we derived @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are very discrepant from our afosc magnitudes taken the previous night .",
    "as the transformations for field stars proved to be reliable the only explanation for this serious discrepancy is the strong emission line sn spectrum producing systematic differences in the colour terms compared to the stellar seds .",
    "hence we quote the @xmath18 band magnitude only for these two nights as the @xmath24 transformations can not be relied upon to produce magnitudes consistent with our previous calibrations .",
    "the errors in the magnitudes were calculated as with the jkt data .",
    "the cta observations were taken with the asiago faint object spectrograph and camera ( afosc ) , a focal reducer instrument , which is equipped with a tektronix 1024@xmath171024 ccd with a pixel sampling of 0.47 arcsec pixel@xmath27 .",
    "the tng observations were instead secured with the device optimized for low resolution ( dolores ) , which is equipped with a loral 2k@xmath172k ccd with a pixel scale of 0.275 arcsec pixel@xmath27 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques within iraf .",
    "the sn magnitudes were measured using the iraf point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting task daophot .",
    "this procedure allows the simultaneous fitting and subtraction of the galaxy background . for cases in which the seeing is fair ,",
    "where the sn is relatively bright and its psf well - sampled , it has been found that this method produces results in excellent agreement with the template subtraction method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the errors in the derived magnitudes were calculated by combining in quadrature the standard deviation of the magnitudes found from each of the calibration stars , the psf fitting error and the standard deviation of the magnitudes of artificial stars placed around the sn position having the sn magnitude .",
    "the photometry results , from all telescopes , are tabulated in table [ tab : opphot ] .",
    "the earlier data are plotted in the @xmath11 light curves in figure  [ fig : bvri ] whereas the late - time data are shown in figure  [ fig : lclt ] .

    "the spectra have been flux scaled using the method of  [ sec : spec ] , with the spectra of 1997d being scaled by an extra factor of five for clarity .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2003gd shows some similarities to both sne  1997d and 1999em , but more so to that of sn  1999em with its broad spectral features .",
    "the spectral flux of sn  1997d is much fainter than that of sn  2003gd , and also has much narrower spectral features indicative of the lower velocities .",
    "the appearance of the spectra , the higher velocities , the colour evolution and higher plateau luminosities of sn  2003gd suggest that it is more akin to the `` normal '' type ii - p events .      @xcite present the discovery of a red supergiant which exploded as sn  2003gd .",
    "the galaxy was imaged six to nine months before the supernova explosion by _ hst _ and the gemini telescope .",
    "_ hst _ images after the explosion confirmed the positional coincidence of the supernova with a single resolved star .",
    "the observational properties of the star were compared with stellar evolutionary tracks . the progenitor star s colours and luminosity",
    "were found to be consistent with those of a red supergiant with an initial main sequence mass of @xmath5 .",
    "however , the reddening and distance used in @xcite has since been updated to @xmath28 (  [ sec : red ] ) and @xmath29 (  [ sec : d ] ) , and we recalculate the bolometric luminosity of the progenitor star using these values .",
    "we find @xmath30 with no difference in the corresponding luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore find no changes to the authors conclusions .",
    "we use equation 2 of @xcite , shown here in equation [ equ : m ] , @xmath32 to compare the observed properties of sn  2003gd with the observed mass of @xmath5 .",
    "since we can only make assumptions about the length of the plateau , we have used this equation to constrain the plateau length to ascertain whether it is consistent with other type ii - p sne .",
    "based on the observed mass we have estimated the ejected mass to be 6 , leaving 2  for the mass of the compact remnant plus other mass losses from the system .",
    "we find that the observed mass is consistent with a plateau length of @xmath33 days , where the errors are the combined errors in each of the parameters in the equation .",
    "for the error in the ejected mass we have added , in quadrature , an extra error of 1  to the error in the observed mass . using the full range of the observed mass , and other parameters , we find the supernova parameters are consistent with a plateau range of 40 - 119 days , although realistically this is unlikely to be below around 90 days , from what is commonly observed for sne  ii - p . within the errors this mass appears not to be inconsistent with the observations and",
    "may suggest a mass in the upper end of the mass range .",
    "the model of @xcite , when applied to sn  2003gd ( see  [ sec : zamp ] ) , also seems to favour a main sequence mass in the upper end of the observed range , although this is achieved with a distance in the lower end of our distance range ( model a ) .",
    "model b estimates an ejected mass of 13  using 9.2 mpc , so is directly comparable with the observed mass .",
    "this is just outside the observed mass range , but is not necessarily inconsistent given the theoretical uncertainties associated with the model .",
    "the model does appear to rule out an explosion date closer to discovery ( model c ) .",
    "we would like to stress though that more observations of progenitors are needed to fully test and constrain this model .",
    "the observations of progenitors have important implications for the low - luminosity `` faint '' sne  ii - p .",
    "there are two very different plausible progenitor models for these , one being the low - energy explosion of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    "the collapsing core forms a black hole and a significant amount of fall - back of material occurs .",
    "an alternative scenario is the low - energy explosion of low - mass stars , presented by who successfully reproduced the observations of sn  1997d with an explosion of @xmath34 ergs and an ejected mass of 6 .",
    "the findings of @xcite support the high - mass progenitor scenario .",
    "the authors find a bimodal distribution of supernovae in the nickel mass , initial main sequence mass ( @xmath35 ) plane .",
    "a reproduction of the authors figure 1 ( right ) is shown here in figure [ fig : zamp ] with the observational points of sne  2003gd and 1999em added with filled circles .",
    "zampieri remarks that the theoretical estimates of @xmath35 from @xcite , shown with open circles in the figure , will most probably need to be revised using the value of the opacity from  [ sec : zamp ] . in this picture the upper branch forms the `` normal '' type ii - p branch and the lower the `` faint '' branch , with sn  2003gd occupying the lower end of the `` normal '' branch . the alternative low - mass scenario positions the `` faint '' sne at the lower end of the `` normal '' branch in one continuous distribution .",
    "until there are direct detections of the progenitor stars of these supernovae , we can not determine if either of these models is a true model .",
    "sne  ii - p produce a large range of nickel masses from around @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite showed that a correlation exists between the amount of nickel produced in the explosion and the absolute magnitude in the @xmath18-band during the plateau phase .",
    "a reproduction of @xcite s figure 3 is shown here in figure [ fig : hamuy ] with sn  2003gd shown with a filled triangle .",
    "four other supernovae , sne  1994n , 1999eu , 2001dc and 2003z represented with open stars , are from @xcite .",
    "these four supernovae plus sn  1999br are from the group of `` faint '' type ii - p supernovae . in this figure ,",
    "sn  2003gd is in the centre of a continuous distribution of supernovae between the low nickel , faint sn  1999br and the high nickel , bright sn  1992am .",
    "@xcite made a comparison between all the known , direct information available on supernova progenitors with the theoretical predictions of @xcite , whose work on the pre - supernova evolution of massive stars produced supernova population diagrams as a function of mass and metallicity .",
    "these models do not consider binary stars or rotation .",
    "we plot this supernova population diagram in figure [ fig : heger ] and add sn  2003gd , which has a solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "we repeat the caution which @xcite issues , emphasising that at present this is a qualitative comparison . whilst saying this , the progenitor detected for sn  2003gd is consistent with the theoretical ii - p region undergoing a o / ne / mg core collapse albeit close to the theoretical boundaries .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic data on the type ii - p sn  2003gd .",
    "we compared the @xmath11 light curves with those of the well observed , spectroscopically similar sn  1999em using a @xmath38-fitting algorithm .",
    "this analysis allowed us to estimate an explosion epoch of jd 2452717@xmath3921 , corresponding to a date of 18th march 2003 , and the @xmath40 magnitudes during the plateau phase .",
    "it was noted during this analysis that the tail luminosity of sn  2003gd was much lower than that of sn  1999em . using this explosion epoch",
    "we were able to compare the velocity evolution of sn  2003gd with those of other similar type ii - p sne .",
    "the velocity evolution was found to be comparable at all epochs in our dataset .",
    "this enabled us to extrapolate the velocity evolution of sn  2003gd backwards to find the velocity during the plateau phase .",
    "we calculated three distances to m74 using two different methods , the standardised candle method ( scm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the brightest supergiant method .",
    "firstly , using the inferred velocity and @xmath40 magnitudes , we estimated a distance of @xmath41 mpc with the scm .",
    "we then used _ hst _ ( wfpc2 ) photometry to estimate the distances of @xmath42 mpc and @xmath43 mpc using two different bsm calibrations .",
    "using these three distances and other distances within the literature we estimated an overall distance of @xmath4 mpc to m74 .",
    "this distance allowed the mass of @xmath14ni to be estimated at 0.016  .",
    "a comparison was made between the observed data of sn  2003gd and the semi - analytical models of @xcite .",
    "these models firstly tested the input parameters of the code and secondly ascertained whether the distance and explosion epoch were consistent with the observed progenitor mass .",
    "it was found that in order for the model to produce an ejected mass consistent with the observed progenitor mass the opacities needed were large , @xmath44 @xmath45 g@xmath27 , suggesting little mixing occurred in sn  2003gd .",
    "the results of the models suggested that the progenitor was probably in the upper end of the progenitor mass range of @xmath5  and the explosion was not likely to have occurred much later than estimated in  [ sec : epoch ] .",
    "the low tail luminosity of sn  2003gd sparked a debate about the nature of this supernova , whether it was a `` normal '' type ii - p or whether it belonged to the group of `` faint '' , low nickel sne . to ascertain this we compared the colour evolution , pseudo - bolometric light curve and a spectrum ( 100 days ) of sn  2003gd with those of sne belonging to the `` normal '' and `` faint '' groups .",
    "we also compared the observed mass of the supernova with theoretical models . using all the information available for sn  2003gd we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "the colour evolution of sn  2003gd is similar to that of the `` normal '' type ii - p sne , although the reddening at the end of the plateau phase is slightly steeper it does not show a colour excess like the `` faint '' supernovae .",
    "the plateau luminosity of sn  2003gd is comparable to those of normal type ii - p sne although the decline from the plateau to the tail is greater .",
    "3 .   the tail luminosity of sn  2003gd , despite the larger decrease , is greater than the tail luminosity of the `` faint '' type ii - p sne .",
    "the spectra are much more similar to the `` normal '' type ii - p sne , with their broad spectral features , than the `` faint '' sne , which are much fainter and have much narrower spectral features .",
    "5 .   the velocities of sn  2003gd are comparable to those of the normal type ii - p group .",
    "sn  2003gd lies in the centre of the correlated , continuous distribution of sne  ii - p in the @xmath46/@xmath47 plane which has the low nickel , faint sn  1999br and high nickel , bright sn  1992am at its extremities . 7 .",
    "the observed progenitor mass of sn  2003gd lies at the lower end of the `` normal '' type ii - p sn branch in the @xmath46/@xmath35 plane @xcite . 8 .   in the sn population diagram of @xcite the observed progenitor mass of sn  2003gd lies in the type ii - p region , which undergoes o / ne / mg core collapse , albeit close to the boundaries .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observations and observed properties of sn  2003gd are consistent with the observed progenitor star , a red supergiant of mass @xmath5  @xcite , which resulted in a normal type ii - p supernova at the end of its life .",
    "observations were made using the wht , int and jkt , which are operated by the isaac newton group ( ing ) , and also with the italian tng , which is operated by the centro galileo galilei of the inaf ( instituto nazionale di astrofisica ) .",
    "these telescopes are operated on the island of la palma at the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
    "this paper is also partially based on observations collected at the asiago observatory , italy , and at the european southern observatory , chile .",
