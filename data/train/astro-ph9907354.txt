    "two puzzling observations are challenging cosmologists .",
    "the supernovae cosmology project and the high - z supernova search ( @xcite ) have extended the reach of the hubble diagram to high redshift and provided new evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "this _ may _ imply that there exists a significant positive cosmological constant , @xmath1 . in separate work ,",
    "the spacings between quasar ( qso ) absorption lines were examined in keck i data at medium redshifts , @xmath4 , ( @xcite ) and compared with those in the laboratory ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these observations are sensitive to time variations in the value of the fine structure constant @xmath5 , ( where @xmath6 is the electron charge , @xmath7 planck s constant , and @xmath2 the speed of light ) , at a rate one million times slower that the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "evidence was found for a small variation in the value of @xmath0 at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "this could be produced by intrinsic time variation or by some unidentified line - blending effect . in this letter",
    "we assume that the variation is intrinsic and show that there may be a link between the observations of cosmological acceleration and varying @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath9 , then cosmology faces a very serious fine tuning problem , and this has motivated extensive theoretical work .",
    "there is no theoretical motivation for a value of @xmath1 of currently observable magnitude ; a value @xmath10 times smaller that the natural planck scale of density is needed if @xmath1 becomes important near the present time . such a small non - zero value of @xmath1 is unnatural in the sense that making it zero _ reduces _ the symmetry of spacetime .",
    "a tentative solution is quintessence ( @xcite ) : the idea that @xmath1 might be a rolling scalar field exhibiting very long transients .",
    "here we introduce another explanation .",
    "there are a variety of possible physical expressions of a changing @xmath0 .",
    "bekenstein proposed a varying @xmath6 theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative is the varying speed of light ( vsl ) theory ( @xcite ) in which varying @xmath0 is expressed as a variation of the speed of light .",
    "the choice between these two types of theory transcends experiment , and merely reflects theoretical convenience in the choice of units ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest cosmology following from vsl is known to contain an attractor in which @xmath1 and matter remain at fixed density ratios throughout the life of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "such attractor solves the fine tuning problem forced upon us by the supernovae results .",
    "hence there is scope for the observed changing @xmath0 to be related to the observed acceleration of the universe . in this _",
    "letter _ we propose a model which leads to good quantitative agreement , given experimental errors , between the observations of acceleration and varying @xmath0 . in section  [ hubble ]",
    "we examine the construction of the hubble diagram in vsl theories , and the interpretation of varying-@xmath0 experiments .",
    "then in section  [ model ] we present an example of a vsl model which can jointly explain the supernovae results and the webb et al varying-@xmath0 results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of some further aspects of the model proposed , to be investigated elsewhere .",
    "the hubble diagram is a plot of luminosity distance against redshift .",
    "the purpose is to map the expansion factor @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the comoving proper time .",
    "redshifts provide a measurement of @xmath13 at the time of emission . if the objects under observation are `` standard candles '' ( as type ia supernovae are assumed to be ) , their apparent brightness gives their ( luminosity ) distance , which , if we know @xmath2 , tells us their age . by looking at progressively more distant objects we can therefore map the curve @xmath11 .",
    "we now examine how this construction is affected by a changing @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "we showed that @xmath14 for photons in free flight .",
    "we also showed that quantum mechanics remains unaffected by a changing @xmath2 if @xmath15 ( in the sense that quantum numbers are adiabatic invariants ) .",
    "then all relativistic energies scale like @xmath16 .",
    "if for non - relativistic systems @xmath17 , the rydberg energy @xmath18 also scales like @xmath16 .",
    "hence all absorption lines , ignoring the fine structure , scale like @xmath16 .",
    "when we compare lines from near and far systems we should therefore see no effects due to a varying @xmath2 ; the redshift @xmath19 is still @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath6 label epochs of observation and emission .    in order to examine luminosity distances",
    ", we need to reassess the concept of standard candles . for simplicity",
    "let us first treat them as black bodies .",
    "then their temperature scales as @xmath22 ( @xcite ) , their energy density scales as @xmath23 , and their emission power as @xmath24 , implying that standard candles are brighter in the early universe if @xmath25 . however , the power emitted by these candles , in free flight , scales like @xmath2 ; each photon s energy scales like @xmath16 , its speed like @xmath2 , and therefore its energy flux like @xmath2 .",
    "the received flux , as a function of @xmath2 , therefore scales like : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the conformal distance to the emitting object , and the subscripts @xmath27 and @xmath6 label received and emitted . in an expanding universe",
    "we therefore still have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the emitting power of standard candles today .",
    "notice that the above argument is still valid if the candles are not black bodies ; it depends only on the scaling properties of emitted and received power .",
    "we can now set up the hubble diagram .",
    "consider the taylor expansion @xmath30",
    "\\label{expansion}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the hubble constant , and @xmath32 is the decceleration parameter . hence up to second order @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{t - t0}\\ ] ] from ( [ lum ] ) we find that the luminosity distance @xmath35 is @xmath36 the conformal distance to the emitting object is given by @xmath37 from ( [ expansion ] ) we have that @xmath38\\ ] ] where we have assumed that locally @xmath39 ( that is @xmath40 $ ] ) .",
    "substituting ( [ t - t0 ] ) we finally have : for all systems we would have got instead @xmath41 $ ] , with @xmath42 .",
    "this does not affect any of the conclusions . ]",
    "@xmath43\\ ] ] we see that besides the direct effects of vsl upon the expansion rate of the universe , it also induces an effective _  acceleration _ in the hubble diagram as an `` optical illusion '' ( we are assuming that @xmath2 decreases in time : @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "we have seen that vsl introduces no intrinsic effects in the redshifting spectral line or in the dimming of standard candles with distance and expansion .",
    "the only effect vsl induces on the construction of the hubble diagram is that for the same redshift ( that is , the same distance into the past ) objects are farther away from us because light travelled faster in the past .",
    "but an excess luminosity distance , for the same redshift , is precisely the hallmark of cosmological acceleration .",
    "however , we need to consider the other experimental input to our work : the @xcite results . by measuring the fine structure in absorption systems at redshifts",
    "@xmath45 we can also map the curve @xmath46 . since @xmath47",
    "$ ] we have @xmath48 $ ] , and so to first order @xmath49 $ ] . however , the results presented in show that @xmath50 is at most of order @xmath51 this means that the direct effects of varying @xmath2 permitted by the qso absorption system observations are far too small to explain the observed acceleration . we need to look at a fully self - consistent generalisation of general relativity containing the scope for varying @xmath2",
    "we start with some general properties of the dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "drawing inspiration from dilaton theories ( like brans - dicke gravity ) we take @xmath52 as the dynamical field associated with @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , powers of @xmath2 appear in all coupling constants , which in turn can be written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the dilaton .",
    "another theory using a similar dynamical variable is the changing @xmath55 theory of @xcite ( which uses @xmath56 ) .",
    "we then endow @xmath57 with a dynamics similar to the dilaton",
    ". the left - hand side for the @xmath57 equation should therefore be @xmath58 ( in the preferred lorentz frame - to be identified with the cosmological frame ) .",
    "this structure ensures that the propagation equation for @xmath57 is second - order and hyperbolic , i.e. propagation is causal . since vsl breaks lorentz invariance other expressions would be possible - but",
    "then the field @xmath59 would propagate non - causally .",
    "an example is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the tangent vector of the local preferred frame .    on the other hand one need not choose ( as in brans - dicke theories ) the source term to be @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the energy density and pressure of matter respectively . without the requirement of lorentz invariance other expressions are possible , and using them",
    "does not conflict with local causality . if @xmath65 is the stress - energy tensor we can choose as a source term @xmath66 ; that is changes in @xmath2 are driven by the matter pressure .",
    "we find this choice is the one that gives interesting effects .    for a homogeneous field in an expanding universe we therefore have @xmath67 , where @xmath64 is the total pressure of the matter fields and @xmath68 is a coupling constant ( distinct from the brans dicke coupling constant ) .",
    "the full self - consistent system of equations in a matter - plus - radiation universe containing a cosmological constant stress @xmath69 is therefore @xmath70 where subscripts @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote radiation and matter respectively .",
    "we have assumed that the sink term ( [ totaleqns3 ] ) is reflected in a source term in ( [ totaleqns2 ] ) ( and not in ( [ totaleqns4 ] ) ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that this term is only significant very early on , when even massive particles behave like radiation .",
    "we have ignored curvature terms because in the quasi - lambda dominated solutions we are about to explore we know that these are smaller than @xmath73 , ( @xcite ) . here , in complete contrast to brans - dicke theory , the field @xmath57 is only driven by radiation pressure in the dust - dominated era .",
    "in other words , only conformally invariant forms of matter couple to the field @xmath59 .    in a radiation - dominated universe the behaviour of this system changes at the critical value @xmath74 . for @xmath75 we reach a flat @xmath76 attractor as @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 we have attractors for which @xmath79 and @xmath80 maintain a constant ratio ( see @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot a numerical solution to this system , with @xmath81 ( a @xmath82 tuning below the critical value @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 during the radiation epoch .",
    "as expected from , this forces @xmath85 to drop to zero , while the expansion factor acquires a radiation - dominated form , with @xmath86 . by the time the matter - dominated epoch is reached",
    ", @xmath85 is of order @xmath87 . during the matter epoch ,",
    "the source term for @xmath57 disappears in eq .",
    "( [ sor ] ) , @xmath50 starts to approach zero , @xmath85 starts to increase , and the expansion factor takes on the @xmath88 dependence of a matter - dominated universe . a few expansion times into the matter epoch , @xmath85 becomes of order 1 and the universe begins accelerating . by the time this happens @xmath50 is of order @xmath89 , in agreement with the expectations of @xcite .",
    "this type of behaviour can be achieved generically , for different initial conditions , with a tuning of @xmath68 that never needs to be finer than a few percent .",
    "we can provide an approximate argument explaining why this theory should display this type of behaviour and why we need so little fine tuning of @xmath90 to explain the supernovae experiments .",
    "if we neglect changes in @xmath2 after matter - radiation equality , @xmath91 , we are going to require @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , and @xmath95 during the radiation epoch .",
    "we can integrate the conservation equations to give @xmath96 with @xmath97 constant , from which it follows that @xmath98 .}\\ ] ] we see that assymptotically @xmath99 grows to infinity , if @xmath100 ( the flat @xmath101 attractor of @xcite ) .",
    "however the growth is very slow even if @xmath102 is not very small .",
    "our theory displays very long transients , and a very slow convergence to its attractor , a property similar to quintessence models ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to achieve @xmath103 at the end of the radiation epoch , with @xmath104 chosen to be of order @xmath105 .",
    "now , why is the change in @xmath2 of the right order of magnitude to explain the results of @xcite ? with a solution of the form @xmath93 we find that @xmath106 valid in the matter dominated era , regardless of the details of the radiation to matter transition .",
    "with @xmath107 we therefore have @xmath108 of the right order of magnitude .",
    "the order of magnitude of the index @xmath109 , observed by @xcite , is therefore fixed by the ratio of the radiation and the matter energy densities today .",
    "in this letter we proposed a theory relating the supernovae results and the observations by @xcite .",
    "the theory we have proposed is one example within a class whose members exhibit similar behaviour . in these theories",
    "the gravitational effect of the pressure drives changes in @xmath2 , and these convert the energy density in @xmath110 into radiation .",
    "thus @xmath111 is prevented from dominating the universe during the radiation epoch . as the universe cools down",
    ", massive particles eventually become the source of pressureless matter and create a matter - dominated epoch . in the matter epoch",
    "the variation in @xmath2 comes to a halt , with residual effects at @xmath112 at the level observed by webb et al .",
    "as the @xmath2 variation is switched off , the @xmath1 stress resurfaces , and dominates the universe for a few expansion times in the matter - dominated era , in agreement with the supernovae results .    in a forthcoming publication",
    "we shall address other aspects of this theory , beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we mention nucleosynthesis , the location in time of a quantum epoch , and perturbations around the homogeneous solution discussed here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis in particular may provide significant constraints on this class of models .",
    "however we expect a variation in @xmath55 to require variations in other couplings if some unification exists .",
    "nucleosynthesis involves many competing effects contributed by weak , strong and electromagnetic , and gravitational interactions and we do not know how to incorporate all the effects self - consistently .",
    "studies of the effects of varying constants coupled by kaluza - klein extra dimensions have been made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most detailed study to date was conducted by @xcite .",
