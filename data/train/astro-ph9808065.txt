    "@xcite performed a survey of the whole sky in the soft x - ray band between 0.12.4 kev @xcite with the position sensitive proportional counter @xcite .",
    "this survey yielded about 60000 x - ray sources with integrated fluxes greater than a few times 10@xmath5 .",
    "one of the outstanding achievements of this survey is that it offers the possibility to investigate the x - ray properties of large samples of astrophysical objects in an unbiased way .",
    "many well - defined samples of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , selected from different wavebands , have meanwhile been studied in the x - ray regime . among others ,",
    "the large bright quasar sample @xcite , the molonglo quasar sample @xcite , the 3crr catalog @xcite and the wall & peacock 2-jy sample @xcite .",
    "in addition , the _ rosat _ all  sky survey ( rass ) has been correlated with large radio catalogs like the molonglo reference catalog ( large et al .",
    "1981 ; brinkmann , siebert & boller 1994 ) and the green bank 5-ghz survey ( condon , broderick & seielstad 1989 ; brinkmann et al .",
    "1995 , 1997b ) as well as the vron quasar catalog ( vron - cetty & vron 1993 ; brinkmann , yuan & siebert 1997a ; yuan , brinkmann & siebert 1998 ) .",
    "for the first time it is possible to compare the x - ray properties of large samples of agn selected at different wavelengths .",
    "these studies make an important contribution to our understanding of the phenomenological differences between the various types of agn and the underlying physical processes .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the x - ray properties of the parkes sample of flat - spectrum radio sources @xcite .",
    "the choice of this sample was particularly motivated by the recent discovery of a large number of sources with extremely red optical to infrared continua in this sample @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that this reddening is due to dust in the line - of - sight and it therefore seemed natural to look for the imprints of this material on the soft x - ray emission by absorption at very low energies .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to compare the x - ray properties of flat - spectrum quasars with those of steep - spectrum quasars , like , for example , the molonglo quasar sample @xcite or the steep - spectrum quasars of brinkmann et al . .",
    "since orientation based unification schemes for radio - loud quasars predict that both classes belong to the same parent population , but with different orientations to the line - of - sight , it is important to see how the x - ray properties fit into this scenario .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the parkes catalog of flat - spectrum radio sources and describe the analysis of the x - ray data from the rass and pointed pspc observations in section 3 .",
    "section 4 deals with the results of our analysis in terms of detection rates , variability , x - ray spectra , and luminosity correlations . in section 5",
    "we focus on the x - ray evidence for dust reddened quasars . a discussion of our results and the conclusions are presented in section 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the original parkes catalog contains about 10000 radio sources and was the result of a survey of the southern sky with the parkes radio telescope at 2.7ghz between 1968 and 1979 ( bolton , savage & wright 1979 ; wright & otrupcek 1990 ) . to compile a large and unbiased sample of radio - selected quasars",
    ", sources were selected from the original survey papers according to the following criteria @xcite : @xmath6 0.5 jy , radio spectral index @xmath70.5 ( where @xmath8 ) , galactic latitude @xmath9 20@xmath10 , @xmath1110@xmath10 , 2.7ghz ( @xmath12 ) and 5ghz flux density ( @xmath13 ) available in the papers .    by selecting flat - spectrum radio sources",
    "the resulting sample is biased towards core - dominated quasars , because radio galaxies and lobe - dominated quasars generally have steeper radio spectra .",
    "the final complete list contains 323 sources .",
    "special care has been taken in the optical identification of the objects and in the determination of their redshifts . using optical databases and new observations ,",
    "321 sources could be identified and for 277 of them redshifts are available .",
    "drinkwater et al .",
    "used digitized optical plates to automatically classify the morphologies as 237 stellar ( unresolved ) , 35 galaxy ( resolved ) , 11 merged ( two or more images too close together on the optical plate to be separated ) and 38 faint sources ( too faint to classify ) .",
    "they used ccd images to deconvolve and identify the 11 merged objects .",
    "all of these were stellar except pks  1555@xmath14140 which was a galaxy. for the purposes of this paper we define an additional category of 14 bl lac objects being the 12 stellar , one galaxy and one merged objects that are _ bona fide _ bl lac objects according to padovani & giommi.097 , 0118@xmath14272 , 0138@xmath14097 , 0301@xmath14243 , 0422@xmath15004 , 0426@xmath14380 , 0537@xmath14441 , 0823@xmath15033 , 0829@xmath15046 , 1144@xmath14379 , 1514@xmath14241 , 1519@xmath14273 , 2131@xmath14021 , 2240@xmath14260 ] these objects will be handled separately in the following subsections .",
    "we divide the remaining sources as follows : 234 stellar sources ( quasars ) , 35 galaxies and 38 faint sources .",
    "note that the quasar / galaxy distinction is only based on morphology so that a quasar with an associated nebulosity like pks  0445 + 097 is classified as a galaxy. for a discussion of the completeness of the sample and a detailed presentation of the radio and optical data see drinkwater et al . .",
    "for each of the sample sources a 1@xmath161@xmath17 field centered on the radio position was extracted from the _ rosat _ all  sky survey and analysed using a procedure based on standard routines within the exsas environment @xcite .",
    "this procedure uses a maximum - likelihood source detection algorithm which returns the likelihood of existence for a x - ray source at the specified radio position , the number of source photons within 5 times the fwhm of the pspc s point spread function and the error in the number of source photons . for the _ rosat _ all  sky survey the fwhm of the pspc point spread function",
    "is estimated to be @xmath18 arcsec @xcite .",
    "the choice of the background has a significant influence on the results of the source detection procedure , in particular for weak sources .",
    "we estimated the local background by taking the average of two source free boxes , each 10 arcmin by 10 arcmin in size , which are offset by 15 arcmin from the radio position along the scanning direction of the satellite during the all  sky survey observations . in this way it is ensured that the background regions have an exposure similar to the source region .",
    "since it is known that an agn is present at the position of the radio source , we considered a radio source to be detected in x - rays if the likelihood of existence is greater than 5.91 , which corresponds to 3@xmath0 .",
    "if no x - ray source is detected above the specified significance level , we determined the 2@xmath0 upper limit on the number of x - ray photons . to calculate the corresponding count rates we used the vignetting - corrected rass exposure averaged over a circle with radius 5 arcmin centered on the radio position .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes are calculated using the standard _ energy to counts conversion factors _ ( ecf ) assuming a simple power - law model modified by galactic absorption .",
    "we used the photon indices @xmath19 is the power - law slope of the x - ray photon spectrum defined as n(e)@xmath20e@xmath21 .",
    "it is connected to the energy index via @xmath22 . ]",
    "listed in tables 1 and 2 , if the uncertainty is smaller than 0.5 . for the other sources we applied @xmath19 = 2.0 for quasars and @xmath19 = 1.7 for galaxies .",
    "these values represent the average spectral indices of the respective object classes derived in section 4.4 .",
    "in addition to the rass data we searched the _ rosat _ source catalog ( rosat - src ; voges et al . 1994 ) , which was generated from pointed pspc observations .",
    "we found 49 sources which were in the field of view of an observation either as the main target or serendipitously .",
    "of these , 12 were detected in the pointed observation only .",
    "fluxes and luminosities were calculated based on the count rates from the catalog and assuming the same spectral parameters as for the rass data . in the analysis we used the fluxes from the pointed observations only when no survey detection is available .      in general ,",
    "simple power - law models for the x - ray spectra modified by neutral gas absorption were considered in the analysis .",
    "the amount of absorption is parametrized by the column density of neutral hydrogen in the line of sight to the source ( the @xmath23 value ) , assuming standard element abundances and the energy dependent absorption cross sections of morrison & mccammon .",
    "the galactic @xmath23 values are determined from radio measurements @xcite . for each source",
    "two photon indices were determined , one by fixing the absorption to the galactic value , the other one by leaving the amount of absorption as a free parameter .    for weak sources ( mostly from the all  sky survey ) a technique based on hardness ratios was applied to estimate the spectral parameters .",
    "the two standard _",
    "hardness ratios are defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where _ a _ , _ b _ , _ c _ and _ d _ are the number of photons in the pulse height channel intervals 1141 , 52201 , 5290 and 91201 , respectively .",
    "every combination of photon index @xmath19 and absorption @xmath23 leads to unique values for the two hardness ratios when folded with the instrument response .",
    "the inversion of this procedure then allows to determine the spectral parameters from the measured hardness ratios .",
    "however , this method only gives a rough estimate of the spectral parameters , in particular for the two parameter fits .",
    "a detailed discussion of the method is presented in schartel . in total",
    "we obtained spectral information for 104 sources in this way .",
    "whenever a pointed pspc observation was available for a source from the public archive and if a sufficient number of source photons ( 50 ) was accumulated in this pointing , we determined the spectral parameters by explicitly fitting a power - law model to the data .",
    "x - ray spectra of 42 sources were determined in this way with increased accuracy .",
    "the results are presented in table 2 .",
    "a few sources were observed more than once with the pspc ( e.g. 3c 279 ) . in these cases the observation with the longest exposure was chosen for the spectral analysis .",
    "if the number of photons was too low for spectral fitting we again used the hardness ratios ( this time derived from the _ pointed _ observation ) to determine the spectral parameters .    in total",
    ", spectral information could be obtained for 115 sources of the sample .",
    "the x - ray spectra are discussed in section 4.4 .",

    "errors are 90 per cent confidence . columns ( 5)(7 ) the same as ( 1)(3 ) , but for the distributions resulting from the analysis with @xmath23 as a free parameter .",
    "we investigated the resulting photon index distributions for quasars , bl lac objects and galaxies using a maximum - likelihood procedure @xcite , which gives an estimate of the mean and the _ intrinsic _ dispersion of a supposed parent distribution and which takes into account the errors on the individual data points .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ ml ] and in table [ mlgam ] .",
    "the average photon index for the flat - spectrum quasars is @xmath26 for fixed galactic @xmath23 and it remains the same , when absorption is considered as a free parameter .",
    "the soft x - ray spectra of flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars are thus flatter ( @xmath27 ) than that of ordinary radio - loud quasars ( @xmath28 ; cf .",
    "brinkmann et al .",
    "1995 ; brunner et al .",
    "1992 ) with a similar redshift range .",
    "the latter point is important because of the well - known redshift dependence of the soft x - ray photon index ( schartel et al .",
    "1996 ; brinkmann et al .",
    "1997a ) , which will be discussed below .",
    "if we only consider sources with @xmath29 in the maximum - likelihood analysis , the average spectral index for fixed @xmath23 steepens to @xmath30 .",
    "this result is completely consistent with the results of brinkmann et al . for an inhomogeneous sample of flat - spectrum quasars with @xmath29 from the vron  vron catalog .",
    "we thus confirm that the x - ray spectrum of flat - spectrum quasars is on average flatter than that of steep - spectrum quasars by @xmath31 .",
    "the non - zero dispersion @xmath0 of the photon index distribution for quasars indicates that the width of the distribution is not only due to statistical fluctuations , but that the distribution is intrinsically broadened .",
    "this is not surprising , since the measured photon index also depends on several other source parameters like for example redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ gz ] ) and radio spectral index ( see fig",
    ". [ galp ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the distribution is significantly smaller for the fits with @xmath32 .",
    "this might either indicate that a simple absorbed power - law is not a valid description of the soft x - ray spectrum for a number of sources or that the spectra are altered by additional absorption .",
    "the latter idea will be discussed in detail in section 5 . here",
    "we only note that the quasar with the flattest x - ray spectrum for fixed galactic @xmath23 is pks 0438 - 436 at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the fit , however , is statistically not acceptable ( cf .",
    "table [ fits ] ) .",
    "the free absorption result indicates additional absorption in the line - of - sight , which seems to be quite common for high redshift radio - loud quasars ( cappi et al . 1997 ; elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the bl lac objects contained in the sample have significantly steeper soft x - ray spectra than the other object classes ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the results are consistent for the one and the two parameter fits .",
    "all bl lacs are radio - selected and , moreover , belong to the class of objects with low - energy cutoffs of the spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "apart from one , all bl lacs for which spectral information could be obtained are also included in the analysis of the 1-jy bl lac sample by urry et al . .",
    "our average photon index is steeper than that of the total 1-jy sample ( @xmath28 ; urry et al .",
    "1996 ) , but still consistent within the errors .",
    "radio galaxies exhibit harder x - ray spectra on average compared to quasars and bl lac objects . from the 17 galaxies with spectral information available we find @xmath36 .",
    "the result is consistent with the average spectral indices for much larger samples of radio galaxies presented in brinkmann et al . and",
    "brinkmann et al . .",
    "the dependence of the quasar soft x - ray photon index on redshift is shown in fig .",
    "[ gz ] for sources with well - determined spectra , i.e. @xmath37 . according to schartel et al . , it is due to the fact that the _ rosat _ pspc samples the x - ray spectrum at increasingly higher energies in the rest - frame of the source as the redshift increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the steep soft x - ray component is shifted out of the pspc energy range and the generally flatter x - ray component at higher energies starts to dominate in the observed 0.12.4 kev range .",
    "this effect is also seen in the present sample of flat - spectrum quasars .",
    "a spearman rank correlation test gives a probability of @xmath38 that the observed correlation occurs by chance .",

    "the result is perfectly consistent with the findings of brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997a ) for a much larger , but inhomogeneous sample of flat - spectrum quasars .",
    "interestingly , the dependence on redshift is slightly steeper for flat - spectrum quasars than for steep - spectrum quasars ( @xmath40 . this may be interpreted in terms of an selection effect . in flux",
    "limited samples only the most luminous objects are included at any given redshift ( malmquist - bias ) .",
    "for flat - spectrum radio samples this means that at higher redshifts one preferentially selects objects , where the spectral energy distribution is dominated by beamed emission from the radio jet .",
    "therefore it is the combination of the intrinsically higher energies sampled with the pspc observations and the increasing contribution of the flat x - ray component from the jet that produce a steeper gradient of the photon index with redshift compared to steep - spectrum quasars where the latter effect is less important .",

    "we note that brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997a ) find no significant correlation of @xmath19 with @xmath62 for flat - spectrum quasars , which may be due to the fact that we constrain our analysis to objects with well - determined photon indices ( almost half of them from fits to data obtained in pointed pspc observations ) .    within the framework of orientation dependent unification scenarios for radio - loud agn ( urry & padovani 1995 and references therein ) , steep- and flat - spectrum radio sources are the increasingly aligned counterparts of fanaroff - riley type ii radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore the radio spectral index roughly indicates the orientation of the source with respect to the line of sight . in this model the observed correlation between x - ray and radio spectral index can be interpreted as being due to a beamed x - ray component with a harder spectrum , which is directly related to the radio emission from the radio core and which dominates the total x - ray emission at small angles to the line - of - sight .      to investigate whether the emission at two different frequencies is _ intrinsically _ related ,",
    "we seek for correlations in luminosity - luminosity diagrams .",
    "it is often stated that observed luminosity correlations are significantly affected by redshift effects , i.e. the correlation appears in absolute luminosities even for uncorrelated fluxes , because the ( narrow ) flux range is stretched out by a large distance factor .",
    "feigelson & berg invert this argument by pointing out that objects will not be detected in small flux ranges at two frequencies _ unless _ the luminosities are intrinsically related .",
    "generally , the more distant objects will exhibit flux upper limits in one band if no relationship exists .",

    "for the x - ray luminosity the photon indices for galactic absorption as derived in section 3.3 were used if the error is smaller than 0.5 .",
    "otherwise the average values for quasars , galaxies and bl lac objects were applied .",
    "the optical luminosity is corrected for galactic reddening and k - corrected to 4400   with a spectral index of @xmath66 .",
    "correlation and regression analyses were performed with asurv ( rev.1.3 ; la  valley , isobe & feigelson 1992 ) , which is particularly designed for censored data . for the correlation analysis we applied the modified kendall s @xmath42 and for the regression analysis we used the parametric em algorithm from this software package . to investigate the influence of redshift on the correlations we performed a partial correlation analysis using the procedure described in akritas & siebert , which allows us to determine the partial correlation coefficient in the presence of upper limits and to calculate the significance of this corrected correlation coefficient .",
    "the results from this analysis are summarized in table [ corr ] . for completeness",
    "we give the parameters for both the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 correlation although we will discuss only the latter in detail .    in fig .",
    "[ lxlr ] we show the relation between radio and x - ray luminosity for quasars , galaxies and bl lac objects .",
    "for all three object classes the x - ray and the radio luminosities are obviously correlated with each other .",
    "the slope of the regression line for quasars is @xmath69 , which is consistent with the findings of brinkmann et al . for the inhomogeneous sample of x - ray detected flat - spectrum quasars from the vron - vron catalog .",
    "they find @xmath70 using orthogonal distance regression , which is superior to simple least squares methods for theoretical reasons , but which is unfortunately not available for censored data .",
    "we note that neglecting the upper limits only slightly affects the slope of the correlation .",
    "the partial correlation analysis confirms that the observed relation is not due to a common dependence of both luminosities on redshift . although the probability for the observed correlation to occur by chance increases if redshift effects are taken into account , the correlation is still highly significant ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "compared to quasars , the correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity seems to be steeper for galaxies and bl lac objects . in the case of galaxies ,",
    "the slope of the correlation is consistent with previous findings within the mutual uncertainties ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1984 ; brinkmann et al .",
    "however , an interpretation of the relation between total radio and x - ray luminosity in terms of nuclear activity is hampered by contaminating x - ray emission from various galactic processes or surrounding clusters of galaxies in many of the radio galaxies .",
    "the spatial resolution in the _ rosat _ all  sky survey generally does not allow to isolate the agn contribution to the total x - ray emission .",
    "the slope of the regression line for the bl lac objects is consistent with unity , which might argue for a direct physical relation between the radio and the x - ray emission . since the radiation in both wavebands is thought to be dominated by the relativistic jet ( e.g. kollgaard 1994 )",
    ", this would not be surprising .",
    "however , the partial correlation analysis indicates that the correlation for bl lac objects is strongly influenced by selection effects and is no longer significant , if redshift effects are taken into account . on the other hand we note that the number of objects is rather low .",
    "therefore the results of statistical analyses have to be interpreted with caution .",
    "based on the large scatter in the @xmath72 colors of the quasars in the present sample , webster et al .",
    "claimed that there might be a large population of previously undetected , red quasars .",
    "they suggested that this reddening is due to dust intrinsic to the quasars . in this section",
    "we will investigate if there are any arguments from the x - ray data in support of this hypothesis .",
    "a discussion of the results will be presented in section 6 .",
    "if the optical reddening is due to dust , it is expected that the reddest quasars are also intrinsically absorbed in soft x - rays . using galactic gas - to - dust ratios ( i.e. @xmath73 cm@xmath58 ; bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) , the extinction coefficients @xmath75 from seaton and the energy dependent x - ray absorption coefficients given by morrison & mccammon",
    ", we can estimate the influence of the absorption by cold gas associated with the dust on the soft x - ray flux for a given _ observed _ extinction @xmath76 . for example , @xmath77 corresponds to an intrinsic @xmath23 of @xmath78 cm@xmath58 for local objects , which reduces the _ observed _ x - ray flux in the total 0.12.4 kev energy band by more than a factor of three . for redshifts of @xmath79 , which is the average redshift of the present quasar sample , an observed optical extinction of @xmath77 corresponds to a rest - frame @xmath23 of @xmath80 cm@xmath58 , which reduces the observed 0.12.4 kev flux still by a factor of @xmath81 .",
    "we further note that the decrease of the observed optical ( 4400 ) flux by dust extinction , which is given by @xmath82 , generally is larger than the corresponding decrease of the soft x - ray flux caused by absorption by cold gas associated with the dust , in particular for higher redshifts .",
    "for example , an _ intrinsic _ extinction of @xmath83 at a redshift of @xmath84 reduces the _ observed _ 4400 flux by a factor of 50 , whereas the _ observed _ 0.12.4 kev flux is only reduced by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "this point is important in the discussion of the @xmath4 distribution in section 5.5 .      in a first step we compared the shape of the optical continuum for the detected quasars with those for the upper - limit sources .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ aopt ] for the total sample",
    ". the optical continuum is parametrized by the power - law slope @xmath86 ( f@xmath87 ) , which is given in francis et al .",

    "the values of @xmath88 show a large scatter and range from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , but nevertheless the distributions for detections and upper limits look very similar . in particular , the upper limits do not cluster towards red optical continua .",
    "this is confirmed by a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test , which gives @xmath91 , i.e. if we reject the null - hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent population , the error probability is 83 per cent . confining the sample to low redshifts ( @xmath92 ) , where the absorption effect on the x - ray flux should be most easily detectable",
    ", this probability is even higher ( 97.3 per cent ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that intrinsic absorption by gas / dust is not the main reason for a source not to be detected in soft x - rays and confirm our conclusion in section 4.1 that distance is the most important parameter .",
    "as shown in section 5.1 , absorption by cold gas associated with the inferred amounts of dust can have a significant effect on the soft x - ray flux and hence the observed x - ray luminosity . in fig .",
    "[ histo_xlum ] we compare the soft x - ray luminosity distributions for stellar sources with an optical continuum slope @xmath93 ( hatched ) to those with @xmath94 ( thick line ) . for clarity , only the detected sources are shown . in the statistical analysis , however , we included the upper limits .    for low redshift sources the luminosity distributions are clearly different ( upper panel ) .",
    "on average , the optically red sources have x - ray luminosities which are a factor of 23 lower than those of their blue counterparts . using gehan s generalized wilcoxon test as implemented in asurv , we get @xmath95 , i.e. the probability for erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same is only 0.8 per cent .",
    "we further note that the redshift distributions of the low redshift red and blue subsamples are indistinguishable ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the effect almost completely disappears for sources at higher redshifts ( @xmath97 ; lower panel ) .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity distributions for the two object classes are statistically indistinguishable ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this kind of redshift dependence is the expected signature of intrinsic x - ray absorption by cold gas associated with the dust inferred from the observed optical reddening . in section 5.1",
    "we have shown that the effect of the deduced amount of cold gas on the soft x - ray flux decreases with redshift .",
    "however , there might be selection effects at work , which could lead to a similar result .",
    "in particular , the low - redshift sources , although all of them appear stellar on the ukst and poss i plates , might still be contaminated by galaxies or bl lac objects .",
    "galaxies and bl lac objects are known to have redder optical continua and lower x - ray luminosities than quasars ( brinkmann et al .",
    "we therefore checked databases , literature and our own optical data , if any of the low redshift red sources actually have to be classified as a galaxy or a bl lac object .",
    "first of all , no source shows a strong galaxy continuum in the spectrum as presented in francis et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . only for three sources",
    "the identification seems questionable according to ned .",
    "the sources 1020 - 103 and 1034 - 293 are classified as bl lacs .",
    "however , strong emission lines have been reported for these sources ( falomo , scarpa & bersanelli 1994 ; falomo 1996 ) .",
    "these sources should therefore be considered as quasars instead of bl lac objects . the third source , 0003 - 066 , is listed as a radio galaxy and bl lac candidate in ned , but stickel et al .",
    "classify this source as a quasar based on several weak emission lines .",
    "we conclude that the contamination of the low - redshift red sources by low - luminosity galaxies and bl lac objects can not explain the observed difference in the soft x - ray flux distributions .",
    "next we investigate if the influence of dust associated absorption can be seen in the soft x - ray spectra of the sources directly .",
    "if excess absorption exists , it should lead to a substantially higher value of @xmath23 than the galactic one in the two parameter fits .",
    "again , the effect should be strongest at low redshifts , since the required amounts of intrinsic @xmath23 to produce an observed extinction of @xmath99 may be too low to be significantly detected in high redshift sources . in fig .",
    "[ delnh ] we show the distribution of the difference @xmath100 between the derived @xmath23 and the galactic @xmath23 value for the quasars in the sample .",
    "there seems to be an asymmetry towards positive @xmath101 values .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis shows that most of the high @xmath101 values come from spectral parameters derived from hardness - ratios and the error bars are very large .",
    "in addition , it is known that the hardness ratio technique leads to systematically higher @xmath23 values for weak sources @xcite .",
    "the weighted average of the @xmath101 distribution is @xmath102 @xmath103 , which indicates that excess absorption is not a general feature . in particular , the sources with very red optical continua , show no evidence for systematically higher absorption in soft x - rays .",
    "only six sources show significantly higher observed @xmath32 compared to the galactic @xmath23 value ( 0438@xmath14436 , 1148@xmath14001 , 1402@xmath15044 , 2126@xmath14158 , 2223@xmath14052 , 2351@xmath14154 ) .",

    "the required amounts of intrinsic @xmath23 range from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for these sources .",
    "if we again assume galactic gas - to - dust ratios , the associated dust extinction in the ( observed ) b - band would be much higher than the maximum value ( @xmath107 mag ) observed by webster et al . .",
    "for three of these sources ( 1402 + 044 , 2126 - 158 , 2351 - 154 ) optical continuum slopes are available and they do not indicate a particularly red continuum ( @xmath108 -1.438 , -0.588 and -0.297 , respectively ) .",
    "several explanations for this contradictory result are conceivable and they are briefly discussed in section 6 .",
    "it has been argued by webster et al . that the large dispersion in the x - ray to optical flux ratios for x - ray selected quasars found by stocke et al .",
    "is indicative of variable dust extinction .",
    "this has been criticized by boyle & di matteo , who show that the observed scatter of the x - ray to optical flux ratio in their sample of x - ray selected quasars is much smaller than expected if variable extinction is important .    in fig .",

    "@xmath114 is the observed flux at 4400 , calculated from the @xmath115 magnitude and corrected for galactic reddening according to the formula ( giommi , ansari & micol 1995 ) @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the galactic latitude of the source . in the lower right corner of fig .",
    "[ aox_z ] we show a conservatively calculated error bar , assuming a 25 per cent error of the x - ray flux and an uncertainty of the optical magnitudes of @xmath118 @xcite . since the optical and the x - ray data were not taken simultaneously , we also included the expected b - band variability of @xmath119 mag for a typical quasar of our sample and the rest - frame @xmath120 year baseline between the optical and the x - ray measurements ( hook et al .",

    "a decrease of log ( @xmath110 ) with redshift up to @xmath121 is apparent from fig .",
    "[ aox_z ] and it turns out to be highly significant using spearman s @xmath122 correlation test as implemented in asurv ( @xmath123 for 204 data points ) .",
    "however , this trend is mainly caused by the different spectral indices at optical and x - ray energies , which causes a spurious correlation of the form @xmath124 .",
    "indeed , using asurv to determine the best regression line , we get @xmath125 , if we only consider objects with @xmath126 .",
    "the slope is roughly consistent with the difference in the average spectral indices in the x - ray and the optical regime .",
    "interestingly , the trend with redshift seems to be inverted at redshifts greater than @xmath1272.5 , which is mainly mimicked by a deficit of high redshift sources with low @xmath4 values ( pks 2215@xmath1502 , @xmath128 ) has been detected in a recent pointed _ rosat _ hri observation @xcite .",
    "the deduced x - ray flux is only slightly below the quoted upper limit from the rass . ] .",
    "most likely , various effects combine to result in an apparent deficit of sources with low values of @xmath4 at higher redshifts .",
    "firstly , the x - ray emission could be enhanced , for example by relativistic beaming .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the generally very flat or inverted radio spectra of these objects and their high core dominance .",
    "basically this is a selection effect of the radio sample . at high redshifts",
    "only the most powerful ( and hence probably beamed ) objects make it into the flux limited sample .",
    "further , the optical flux may be reduced , because the ly@xmath62-edge shifts into the b - band for @xmath129 .",
    "finally we note that a positive correlation is also expected in the case of dust extinction , because the effect of dust on the optical continuum of high redshift sources is much stronger than that of the associated neutral gas on the x - ray emission ( cf .",
    "section 5.1 )",
    ". some of these high redshift objects do show significant intrinsic absorption in x - rays ( see previous section ) and they are optically dull with @xmath130 mag .",
    "therefore it can not be excluded that their high x - ray - to - optical flux ratios are at least in part due to dust extinction .",
    "analogous to boyle & di matteo we investigate the dispersion in the distribution of the flux ratio log ( @xmath110 ) , which can be used to at least derive upper limits on the amount of dust obscuration .",
    "as has been shown in section 5.1 , the effect of intrinsic gas and dust on the observed optical flux is much stronger than on the x - ray flux , in particular at higher redshifts .",
    "to first order , the observed spread in log ( @xmath110 ) might therefore be almost completely attributed to variations in @xmath114 due to dust extinction .",
    "if we apply the detections - and - bounds ( db ) method of avni et al . in order to properly account for upper limits , we get @xmath131 and @xmath132 = 0.70 $ ] , which is significantly larger than the boyle & di matteo value ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the derived @xmath134 width of the @xmath4 distribution corresponds to a variation in @xmath110 by a factor of @xmath135 .",
    "assuming that all of the scattering is due to dust extinction ( and thus neglecting other effects like x - ray variability , measurements errors etc . ) , this gives an upper limit to the amount of reddening in the observed b band of @xmath52 3.5 mag .",
    "this is slightly below the maximum values claimed by webster et al . ,",
    "but since the estimate is based on the fwhm of the @xmath4 distribution , the observed maximum value of @xmath136 might still be consistent with the observed scatter .",
    "clearly , the observed scatter in @xmath4 for the parkes quasars can not be regarded as clear evidence for the presence of dust .",
    "we may conclude , however , that it also does not rule out the dust extinction hypothesis , as it has been claimed from the corresponding analysis of x - ray and optically selected samples , which exhibited a much smaller scatter in @xmath4 ( boyle & di matteo 1995 ) .",
    "one of the main aims of this study was to look for any evidence from the x - ray data in favor of or against the hypothesis of webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the observed red continua of many of the parkes flat - spectrum quasars are due to dust extinction .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first of all , none of the observed x - ray properties is in contradiction to the dust hypothesis . on the other hand , it is also difficult to prove the presence of dust from the x - ray data , because the argument is always an indirect one .",
    "the strongest indication for dust comes from the significantly lower x - ray luminosities of the low - redshift stellar objects with red optical continua as compared to their blue counterparts .",
    "the difference vanishes for higher redshifts .",
    "this is expected , if neutral gas associated with the dust is responsible for the soft x - ray absorption and the corresponding reduction of the x - ray flux , because , for high redshifts , the x - ray observation samples increasingly higher energies in the rest - frame spectrum of the source and the column density of neutral gas associated with the dust inferred from optical reddening is too low to significantly affect the x - ray flux at these relatively high rest - frame energies .",
    "therefore no difference in the luminosity distributions for red and blue objects is measurable any more . for the low redshift sources ,",
    "the observed difference in the average x - ray luminosity is about a factor of two , which is consistent with the optical data .",
    "we have further shown that the observed luminosity difference is not due to a contamination of the stellar sources of our sample with low luminosity red sources like bl lac objects or radio galaxies .",
    "we conclude that dust associated absorption represents a viable explanation for the observed effect .    in view of this result",
    "it seems surprising that we do not find any difference in the x - ray detection probability for the red and the blue stellar objects .",
    "since the observed x - ray flux should be reduced by absorption for the reddened sources , it would have been expected that also the fraction of upper limits is higher among these sources . as it is shown in section 5.2 ,",
    "this is obviously not the case .",
    "however , in section 4.1 we concluded that distance is the most important factor , which determines the detection probability in soft x - rays and the absorption effect as discussed above is not strong enough in order to dominate over distance .",
    "indeed , for a given intrinsic luminosity and reasonable amounts of cold gas , the observed soft x - ray flux is at most reduced by a factor of three due to absorption , whereas it declines already by a factor of @xmath1273.5 , when the source is shifted from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .    since many of the spectral parameters were determined from the hardness ratios , which usually results in relatively large uncertainties , it is impossible to derive any stringent constraints on the amount of dust associated absorption from the x - ray spectra of the parkes quasars .",
    "we find only six objects with a significant @xmath139 , however , all of them at high redshift .",
    "thus , the implied amounts of dust ( again assuming galactic gas - to - dust ratios ) would be much higher than observed in the optical spectra .",
    "this apparent discrepancy has already been noted previously ( e.g. elvis et al . 1994 ) and several solutions have been proposed .",
    "first of all , all estimations of the expected amount of x - ray absorption ( or optical reddening ) are based on the assumption of galactic gas - to - dust ratios and it is not at all sure , whether this assumption is still valid at high redshifts .",
    "indeed , pei , fall & bechtold ( 1991 ) show that the gas - to - dust ratio is at least ten times higher in damped ly@xmath62 systems .",
    "therefore a high neutral gas column must not necessarily imply a correspondingly large dust column and therefore significant x - ray absorption must not be accompanied by a large optical extinction .",
    "similarly , the metal abundances could be reduced at large redshifts , which also is indicated by the properties of damped ly@xmath62 systems ( e.g. meyer & roth 1990 ; turnshek et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "finally , also the observed large scatter in the @xmath4 distribution does not allow to draw any firm conclusions about the amount of dust present in radio - loud quasars .",
    "in particular , the observed deficit of high redshift sources with low @xmath4 ratios is most likely not due to dust extinction , because the optical continua of the high redshift sources are not particularly red .",
    "we note , however , that large observed scatter is also not inconsistent with the dust hypothesis as it was claimed previously based on the analysis of optically and x - ray selected samples .",
    "one explanation for the limited evidence for dust associated absorption in the x - ray data could be that the large spread in the @xmath140 colors reported by webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is not due to dust .",
    "many alternative suggestions have been made to explain the observed @xmath140 values , such as an intrinsically red optical continuum , a host galaxy contribution @xcite or relativistic beaming @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the possible origins of the observed @xmath140 colors .",
    "this will be done in a future paper ( francis et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "here we only note that detailed investigations of the optical spectra of many of the red sources show that an intrinsic origin for the red colors gives the best fit to the spectra of around half of the red sources , but the remainder , including many of the reddest sources do show signs of dust reddening ( francis et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "a similar result has been reported by puchnarewicz & mason , who find evidence for reddening by dust among those rixos agn with very red optical continua .",
    "if one accepts the dust hypothesis , then why does nt the neutral gas associated with the dust show up more clearly in the soft x - ray regime ?",
    "various explanations are conceivable .",
    "first of all , it has already been noted that all estimations are based on the assumption that the gas - to - dust ratio in all quasars is the same as that in our galaxy . if the gas - to - dust ratio is lower , the observed dust extinction is not accompanied by a large neutral gas column and the corresponding x - ray absorption",
    "might not be measurable given the limited sensitivity of the presented data .",
    "secondly , the ionization state of the gas associated with the dust is unknown .",
    "if the gas is ionized , its x - ray opacity is reduced and it would therefore allow for larger amounts of dust without strongly affecting the soft x - ray emission .",
    "so - called dusty warm absorbers have recently been claimed to exist in a couple of sources , e.g. iras 1334 + 2438 @xcite and ngc 3786 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the quality of the available x - ray spectra of the sources presented in this paper is not sufficient to constrain the ionization state of the absorbing gas .",
    "high quality x - ray spectra are needed to directly quantify the amount dust probably present in optically red quasars by measuring the carbon absorption edge at @xmath141 kev .",
    "these are currently not available , but future x - ray missions like xmm and axaf , which combine a large effective area with high energy resolution down 0.2 kev , should be able to provide the necessary data .",
    "using _ rosat _ all  sky survey data and pointed pspc observations we determined the x - ray properties of all 323 objects from the parkes sample of flat - spectrum radio sources as defined in drinkwater et al . .",
    "the results are as follows :    1 .",
    "163 sources were detected at the 3@xmath0 level . for the remaining 160 sources 2@xmath0 upper limits to the soft x - ray flux were determined .",
    "2 .   using a hardness ratio technique and explicit fits to the data we determined the soft x - ray spectra of 115 sources .",
    "the average power - law photon index for flat - spectrum quasars is @xmath142 , slightly flatter ( @xmath143 ) than for ordinary radio - loud quasars .",
    "the average photon index for bl lac objects is @xmath3 , whereas radio galaxies generally display harder soft x - ray spectra ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "we confirm the inverse correlation of the spectral index with redshift for radio - loud quasars .",
    "we also find a significant inverse correlation of the photon index with the radio spectral index between 2.7ghz and 5ghz , which is in accord with current orientation dependent unification schemes for radio - loud agn .",
    "correlations of x - ray with total radio luminosity were found for quasars , galaxies and bl lac objects .",
    "partial correlation analyses indicate that a redshift effect is negligible for quasars and galaxies , whereas it might influence the correlation for bl lacs .",
    "the question , whether intrinsic dust is the origin of the observed red optical continua of many of the quasars of the sample , can not be unambiguously answered on the basis of the presented x - ray properties .",
    "nevertheless , it is tempting to interpret the redshift dependence of the difference in the observed x - ray luminosities for optically red and blue sources in terms of dust associated absorption .",
    "however , firm conclusion on the basis of current x - ray data are hampered by the fact that all arguments rely on implicit assumptions , which may not be valid in general , such as galactic gas - to - dust ratios in quasars and a low ionization state of the x - ray absorbing gas associated with dust .",

    "<S> we investigate the x - ray properties of the parkes sample of flat - spectrum radio sources using data from the _ rosat _ all  sky survey and archival pointed pspc observations . in total , 163 of the 323 sources are detected . for the remaining 160 sources 2@xmath0 upper limits to the x - ray flux </S>",
    "<S> are derived . </S>",
    "<S> we present power - law photon indices in the 0.12.4 kev energy band for 115 sources , which were either determined with a hardness ratio technique or from direct fits to pointed pspc data if a sufficient number of photons is available . </S>",
    "<S> the average photon index is @xmath1 for flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars , @xmath2 for galaxies , and @xmath3 for bl lac objects . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - ray photon index is correlated with redshift and with radio spectral index in the sense that sources at high redshift and/or with flat ( or inverted ) radio spectra have flatter x - ray spectra on average . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in accord with orientation dependent unification schemes for radio - loud agn .    </S>",
    "<S> webster et al . discovered many sources with unusually red optical continua among the quasars of this sample and interpreted this result in terms of extinction by dust . </S>",
    "<S> although the x - ray spectra in general do not show excess absorption , we find that low - redshift optically red quasars have significantly lower soft x - ray luminosities on average than objects with blue optical continua . </S>",
    "<S> the difference disappears for higher redshifts , as is expected for intrinsic absorption by cold gas associated with the dust . in addition , the scatter in @xmath4 is consistent with the observed optical extinction , contrary to previous claims based on optically or x - ray selected samples .    </S>",
    "<S> although alternative explanations for the red optical continua can not be excluded with the present x - ray data , we note that the observed x - ray properties are consistent with the idea that dust plays an important role in some of the radio - loud quasars with red optical continua .    </S>",
    "<S> galaxies : active  quasars ; x - rays : general  radio sources : general . </S>"
