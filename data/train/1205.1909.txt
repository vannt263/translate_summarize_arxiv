    "this approach is motivated by the similarity of the structure equations between the relativistic and newtonian ones , but it is not derived from first principle . in a previous paper @xcite , we made use of a general relativistic two - fluid formulation to study the equilibrium properties of dans and proposed the existence of a new class of compact stars which are dominated by dm .",

    "the motion of a small amount of dm basically has no effect on the nm .",
    "hence , the nm essentially decouples from the dm and does not move in the @xmath164 and @xmath165 dm dominated modes .",
    "however , when the mass fraction of dm is comparable to nm , the coupling between the two fluids becomes stronger and hence we can see a large density variation of nm .",
    "the lagrangian variations of the first four oscillation modes for the dm dominated model with @xmath119 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_all_04_06 ] .",
    "we see that for the `` ordinary '' @xmath162 and @xmath168 modes the maximum density variations of the two fluids near their surfaces are comparable . note that the surface of the nm core is at about @xmath172 , where the radius of the star @xmath116 is defined by the radius of the dm halo in this model .",
    "however , for the @xmath164 and @xmath165 dm dominated modes , the maximum density variation of dm is much larger than that of nm .     at the point",

    "[ fig : mr_relation].,width=302,height=226 ]      to end this section , we study the effects of dm particle mass on the mode frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalue_all_14_mass ] we show the frequencies of the first five modes of a dans with @xmath150 and @xmath151 as a function of dm particle mass @xmath146 . for @xmath111",
    "gev , the second and third modes correspond to the @xmath164 and @xmath165 dm dominated modes studied above .",
    "we see that the frequencies of these modes increases with @xmath146 , while the other modes are essentially independent of @xmath146 .",
    "it is known that the radial oscillation mode frequency ( squared ) scales with the density of the star .",
    "also , for a fixed dm core mass , the dm core becomes denser as @xmath146 increases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : density_profile_mass ] ) .",
    "hence , the frequencies of the dm dominated modes depend strongly on @xmath146 .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that , while the second and third modes are dm dominated modes in the case @xmath111 gev , this is in general not true for other @xmath146 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath173 gev , it is the second and fourth modes that are dm dominated modes . for @xmath174 gev ,",
    "the dm dominated mode first appears only in the third mode .",
    "the total mass @xmath161 and dm core mass @xmath175 of the stars are fixed .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]    in this paper , we have studied the equilibrium properties and radial oscillation modes of dans using a general relativistic two - fluid formalism .",
    "we model the nm by realistic nuclear matter eos .",
    "the dm particles are assumed to be non - self - annihilating and described by an ideal degenerate fermi gas .",
    "our results suggest that the structure of these stars depends strongly on the dm fluid .",
    "in particular , we found a new class of compact stars which are dominated by dm .",
    "these stars in general have a small nm core with radius a few km embedded in a larger ten - kilometer - sized dm halo .",
    "since only the nm core can emit thermal radiation , the detection of a compact star with a thermally radiating surface of such a small size could provide a strong evidence for the existence of dans .",
    "furthermore , these dm dominated stars also have rather different mass - radius relations and scaled moment of inertia compared to ordinary ns without dm .",
    "we have also studied how the radius @xmath116 and moment of inertia @xmath141 of a star with fixed nm baryonic mass @xmath133 change as the dm core mass @xmath130 increases . in the small @xmath130 limit",
    ", we see that @xmath116 and @xmath141 decrease linearly as @xmath130 increases .",
    "the slopes of the linear variations depend essentially only on the nm eos , but not on the value of @xmath133 .",
    "we have performed a radial perturbation analysis and studied the oscillation modes of dans in general .",
    "the stability of dans is shown explicitly by calculating the frequency of the fundamental mode . for a sequence of stars with a fixed dm mass fraction",
    ", we see that the fundamental mode frequency passes through zero at the central energy density corresponding to the maximum mass configuration .",
    "similar to the analysis of ordinary ns , this point marks the onset of instability .    besides the fundamental mode",
    ", we have also studied the first few higher order oscillation modes .",
    "we see that dans in general have two classes of oscillation modes .",
    "the first class of modes has proper limit when the dm mass fraction tends to zero , namely these modes reduce to the same set of modes for ordinary ns without dm . on the other hand ,",
    "the second class of modes is due mainly to dm . in the limit of a small dm mass fraction",
    ", these modes are characterized purely by the oscillations of dm .",
    "the nm fluid is essentially at rest . in the intermediate case where the mass fractions of nm and dm are comparable , the nm fluid oscillates with the dm fluid due to their coupling through gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of dm oscillations is much larger than that of nm in the case of dm dominated stars .",
    "we also see that the frequencies of these oscillation modes depend strongly on the dm particle mass .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that the formation mechanism of dans is not clear .",
    "however , our main focus in this work is to study the properties of these theoretical objects , if they exist .",
    "the formation process of these compact dark - matter compact objects can not yet be modeled in current @xmath176-body simulations , which mainly focus on the structure formation in galactic or cosmological scales ."
