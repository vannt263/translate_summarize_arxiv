    "the study of the properties of the @xmath2 @xmath3 resonance , the lowest lying @xmath4 nucleon resonance , provides valuable insight into the nature of qcd in the non - perturbative domain .",
    "in particular , the large mass splitting between the nucleon ground state @xmath5 and its negative parity partner @xmath6 is connected to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "indeed , if the two - flavor chiral symmetry were exact and preserved by the qcd vacuum , qcd would predict parity doublets degenerate in mass  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", new techniques have become available to perform numerical calculations of the properties of nucleon excited states using lattice qcd @xcite . in particular ,",
    "calculations of the mass spectrum of nucleon excited states were performed  @xcite , which implement chiral symmetry at non - zero lattice spacing , by use of domain wall fermions .",
    "the recent quenched lattice qcd calculations @xcite , using different fermion actions , all reproduce quite well the observed large mass splitting between the nucleon and its negative parity partner @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the next generation of lattice qcd calculations opens up the exciting prospect to study how nucleon and resonance properties change when varying the quark mass parameter from the large quark mass regime , where chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , down to sufficiently small quark mass values , where one can use the chiral symmetry of qcd to perform the extrapolation to the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "the large quark mass region may be the regime where a naive constituent quark picture could hold , and one may investigate how such a picture breaks down when approaching physical quark masses .    a particularly useful observable to study in this respect",
    "is the baryon magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) , as it has often been questioned and discussed @xcite why the naive non - relativistic constituent quark model yields a relatively good agreement with the experimentally known values for the mdms of the ground state octet baryons .",
    "recently , it has been studied @xcite how the proton and neutron mdms change when extrapolating from large up- and down - quark masses ( about 6 - 10 times their physical mass values ) where current lattice qcd calculations are performed , down to small quark masses , where the non - analytic behavior in the quark mass can be calculated from the chiral symmetry of qcd . in particular , it has been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the apparent success of the non - relativistic constituent quark model in reproducing the observed ratio of proton to neutron mdms at the physical quark masses is rather coincidental , supporting the finding of ref .",
    "therefore , it may be very revealing to extend such a study to the mdms of nucleon resonances , such as the @xmath7 and the @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath7 mdms have been investigated on the lattice at rather large quark masses @xcite , and very recently the chiral extrapolation of the @xmath7 mdms , including the next - to - leading non - analytic variation with the quark mass , was also studied @xcite . as there is a large gap in quark mass to bridge between the present quenched lattice qcd calculations and the chiral limit , it would be extremely helpful to know the resonance mdm for the physical quark mass values , through experiment .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental information on the mdms beyond the ground state baryon octet is very scarce . with the notable exception of the @xmath8 baryon , these higher nucleon resonances decay strongly , and",
    "thus have too short lifetimes to measure their mdms in the conventional way through spin precession measurements .    for the @xmath9 ,",
    "it was therefore proposed to measure its mdm through the @xmath10 reaction  @xcite , and two experiments were performed @xcite . using different theoretical analyses , the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite quotes as range of the mdm  : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nuclear magneton .",
    "the large uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath13 from the data is due to large non - resonant contributions to the @xmath10 reaction because of bremsstrahlung from the charged pion ( @xmath14 ) and proton ( p ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed  @xcite to determine the magnetic moment of the @xmath15 through measurement of the @xmath16 reaction , thus avoiding bremsstrahlung contributions from the pions .",
    "first calculations for this reaction , including besides the @xmath7 resonant mechanism  @xcite also a background of non - resonant contributions , have recently been performed  @xcite . due to the small cross sections of the @xmath17 reaction",
    ", the first experimental data have been obtained only very recently by the a2/taps collaboration at the mami accelerator  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite sees a clear deviation from the known soft bremsstrahlung processes ( for which the final photon is radiated from the external proton lines ) , and the measured cross sections are in qualitatively good agreement with the calculation of ref .",
    "the deviation from the soft bremsstrahlung contains a sensitivity to the magnetic dipole strength at the @xmath7 resonance position .",
    "the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite does not yet allow for a reliable extraction of this quantity , because of limited statistics .",
    "however , a dedicated experiment to measure the @xmath18 reaction is planned at mami in the near future @xcite .",
    "this experiment will use the @xmath19 crystal ball detector and thus increase the count rates by two orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , this forthcoming experiment  @xcite will be performed with a polarized photon beam , because the sensitivity of the @xmath17 reaction to the @xmath15 mdm can be increased substantially when using linearly polarized photons , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we explore the extension of this technique to access the mdm of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "since the @xmath2 resonance is known to dominate the @xmath20 reaction in the threshold region , the @xmath0 reaction , with a low energy outgoing photon ( up to about 100  mev ) , seems to be a promising tool to isolate the mdm of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "such an experiment can be envisaged using the crystal barrel@elsa and in the near future with the crystal ball@mami , once the higher beam energy of about 1.5 gev becomes available at mami - c .    in section  [ sec : modelmdm ]",
    ", we provide some model estimates for the @xmath2 mdm .",
    "in particular , we present the calculation of the @xmath2 mdm in the constituent quark model and contrast it with the value taken in the picture of the @xmath2 as a @xmath21 quasi - bound ( molecular ) state , as has been proposed in ref .",
    ".    we then develop in section  [ sec : model ] an effective lagrangian model for the @xmath0 reaction in the @xmath2 region , which is obtained by coupling a photon in a gauge invariant way to an analogous model for the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "the model contains both the @xmath2 resonance contribution and a background of non - resonant processes .    in section  [ sec :",
    "soft ] , we discuss the model - independent link between the @xmath20 process and the @xmath0 process in the limit where the outgoing photon energy approaches zero .",
    "we present a low energy theorem , which provides a strong constraint for both the experiment and the theoretical description of the @xmath22 reaction .    in section  [ sec :",
    "results ] , we then use the developed effective lagrangian model as a tool to study the feasibility of an experiment to measure the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "in particular , we investigate the sensitivity of the @xmath0 cross sections and photon asymmetries to the @xmath2 mdm .",
    "the final section summarizes our findings .",
    "in this section , we calculate the results for the mdm of the @xmath2 in the framework of the constituent quark model , and within the picture where the @xmath2 is dynamically generated as a @xmath24 quasi - bound state , as first proposed in ref .  @xcite .      in the nonrelativistic su(6 )",

    "<S> the @xmath0 reaction in the @xmath1(1535 ) resonance region is investigated as a method to access the @xmath1(1535 ) magnetic dipole moment . to study the feasibility , we perform calculations of the @xmath0 process within an effective lagrangian approach containing both the @xmath1 resonant mechanism and a background of non - resonant contributions . </S>",
    "<S> predictions are made for the forthcoming experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on the sensitivity of cross sections and photon asymmetries to the @xmath1(1535 ) magnetic dipole moment .    magnetic moments , @xmath2 resonance , meson photoproduction , effective lagrangian , quark model 14.20.gk , 12.39.jh , 13.60.fz </S>"
