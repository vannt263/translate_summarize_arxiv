    "a focal point of the frontier of high energy nuclear physics at rhic and the lhc is the study of saturation in hadron collisions .",
    "saturation is an effect that emerges due to bremsstrahlung gluon radiation in the hadronic wavefunction .",
    "it was prompted by the theoretical prediction that , at high energy , the gluon density rises rapidly as @xmath2 , the longitudinal momentum fraction of the gluons with respect to their parent hadron , decreases .",
    "this rise is governed by the famous balitskii , fadin , kuraev , and lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation  @xcite , which emerges from resummation of terms proportional to @xmath3 . however ,",
    "when the gluon density becomes high , it is expected that gluons start to recombine and qcd dynamics becomes nonlinear .",
    "this eventually leads to the onset of gluon saturation  @xcite , as a result of the nonlinear qcd dynamics . to quantify",
    "the recombination effect , a nonlinear term in the gluon evolution equation was proposed in ref .",
    "this nonlinear extension of the bfkl evolution equation was later independently derived by balitsky and kovchegov ; accordingly , the equation is referred to as the bk evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it seems that gluon saturation is bound to occur as a result of high energy evolution .",
    "the task remains to find a `` smoking gun '' signature of gluon saturation in _ experimental _ data at e.g. rhic or the lhc .",
    "a wealth of results in @xmath0 collisions , ideal for observing saturation  @xcite , are becoming available .",
    "but it is critical to have precise , quantitative phenomenological calculations in the saturation formalism to compare to these experimental results .    single inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions at high",
    "energy reveals the interesting physics of gluon saturation particularly well , compared to @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the effect of dense gluons in the target nucleus can be characterised by the introduction of a semi - hard momentum scale , which is known as the saturation scale @xmath5 , a function of the momentum fraction @xmath6 , and the nuclear mass number @xmath7 . roughly speaking",
    ", the saturation scale can be used to separate the saturated ( dense ) regime , in which the nonlinear energy evolution applies , from the ( dilute ) regime in which the evoution is linear .",
    "when the typical hard scale of the scattering , @xmath8 , is less than @xmath5 , one expects that the target partons involved in the interaction are saturated . on the other hand , when @xmath9 , the saturation effect is no longer important , and standard perturbative qcd should be sufficient to describe the data .",
    "it is generally believed that the transverse momentum of typical gluons inside nuclear targets is roughly @xmath10 . in high energy @xmath0 collisions , before partons from the proton projectile fragment into hadrons with transverse momentum @xmath11 , they undergo multiple interactions with the dense gluonic fields in the highly boosted target nucleus , picking up a transverse momentum of roughly @xmath5 in the process .",
    "the squared saturation momentum @xmath12 in nuclear targets is @xmath13 times of that in protons , due to random multiple scatterings .",
    "therefore , the transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) spectrum of the produced hadrons exhibits different behaviour in @xmath0 collisions , especially in the relatively low @xmath11 regime , than in @xmath4 collisions .    measurements of single inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions at rhic  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite have provided plenty of data . there have been many theoretical and phenomenological efforts  @xcite on this subject , which imply that gluon saturation ( or shadowing ) plays an important role in the production of forward rapidity hadrons .",
    "the first complete next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation for inclusive hadron productions  @xcite in @xmath0 collisions was achieved a few years ago , using the mueller s dipole formalism ( see ref  @xcite for discussion at nlo ) .",
    "this computation is the first complete nlo calculation which uses dimensional regularization and with the @xmath14 regularization scheme , which is necessary to correctly incorporate the available nlo collinear parton distributions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) without introducing additional scheme dependence .",
    "schematically , the full nlo cross section for hadron production at forward rapidity @xmath15 , with the hadron having transverse momentum @xmath16 , can be written as follows : @xmath17\\sigma}{\\dd { \\ensuremath{y}}\\dd[2]{\\ensuremath{p_\\perp } } } = \\int { \\ensuremath{x_p}}f_i({\\ensuremath{x_p}})\\otimes d_{h / i}({\\ensuremath{z } } ) \\otimes \\mathcal{f}^{{\\ensuremath{x_g}}}_i({\\ensuremath{k_\\perp } } ) \\otimes \\mathcal{h}^{(0 ) }   + \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\alpha_s}}}{2\\pi } \\int { \\ensuremath{x_p}}f_i({\\ensuremath{x_p}})\\otimes d_{h / j}({\\ensuremath{z } } ) \\otimes \\mathcal{f}_{(n)ij}^{{\\ensuremath{x_g}}}\\otimes \\mathcal{h}_{ij}^{(1)},\\ ] ] all the hard factors @xmath18 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are functions of the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the produced parton , represent the fourier transforms of dipole scattering amplitudes . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the parton distribution and fragmentation function , respectively .",
    "the first _ numerical _ analysis of forward hadron production in @xmath0 and @xmath23 collisions in the small-@xmath2 saturation formalism , based on the nlo results in refs .",
    "@xcite , was presented in refs .",
    "it was found that the theoretical uncertainty is significantly reduced compared to leading order ( lo ) results , and the calculated nlo cross section agrees well with forward - rapidity rhic data for @xmath24 .",
    "recall that @xmath5 is the characteristic scale for the gluon density in a heavy nucleus . in general , the @xmath11 region in which the calculation and results agree increases with the center - of - mass scattering energy @xmath25 , since the typical gluon density probed is larger at high energy .",
    "however , the numerical results of the nlo cross section abruptly drop to negative values above some cutoff momentum which is generally slightly greater than @xmath5 .",
    ", the cutoff momentum at which the results become negative , and the boundary of the region in which the calculation accurately describes the data appears to be some sort of rapidity - dependent proportionality , but the details are not clear . ref .",
    "@xcite includes some discussion of the relationship among these momenta . ]    strictly speaking , the saturation formalism always takes the high energy limit @xmath26 , which yields large saturation momentum @xmath5 . in this limit , the nlo results in refs .",
    "@xcite are obtained after the subtraction of the rapidity divergence ( associated with the small-@xmath2 evolution in the @xmath26 limit ) as well as the collinear divergences ( associated with the dglap evolution of pdfs and ffs ) . however , in phenomenological studies of saturation physics , the center - of - mass energy of scatterings is finite and the saturation momentum is not very large .",
    "it is natural to expect that the saturation formalism works when @xmath27 . on the other hand , when @xmath28 , the saturation formalism is believed to be no longer applicable since @xmath29 is no longer small , and the collinear factorization approach should be the relevant formalism to describe the large @xmath1 part of the cross section .",
    "studies  @xcite have shown that the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization is closely related or equivalent to the small-@xmath2 factorization in terms of gauge links  @xcite , if one puts them in the same kinematical region .",
    "a similar kinematic restriction is also required for the tmd factorization in the hard scattering processes , where the transverse momentum @xmath30 is much smaller than the hard momentum scale @xmath31 ( like the invariant mass of lepton pair in the drell - yan process )  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the tmd factorization would be invalid in the large @xmath32 region . in this region , a matching to the collinear factorization calculation",
    "is usually performed  @xcite .",
    "this argument applies to the case studied in this paper as well .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matching between the perturbative results is reached by taking the large @xmath1 limit of the nlo cross section in the small-@xmath2 formalism and enforcing the exact kinematic constraint .",
    "one might wonder if there is a way to naturally implement the kinematic constraint in the small-@xmath2 formalism .",
    "doing so could help extend the applicability of the formalism to the large @xmath1 regime .",
    "recently , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite performed another independent nlo calculation of single inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "their discussion of the ioffe time dependence , which is equivalent to the kinematical constraint , motivated us to investigate the details of the dipole formalism application in this process and compute the effect of the kinematical constraints .",
    "we find that we obtain two additional nlo corrections from incorporating these constraints .",
    "these two terms were conjectured to be small in the @xmath26 high energy limit , and therefore implicitly neglected in the original derivation of the nlo corrections  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar logarithmic term played an important role in deriving the sudakov factor in other hard processes .",
    "we need to emphasize that there is no sudakov factor in the process of single hadron productions .",
    "as we will show later , these additional nlo corrections are indeed small as long as @xmath33 .",
    "however , they become large when @xmath34 . by including these two terms",
    ", we can offset the negativity of the nlo terms at larger @xmath11 and extend the applicability window of the saturation formalism towards larger @xmath11 for single hadron productions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to revisit the issue of the negative nlo cross section found in the large @xmath1 regime of forward - rapidity single inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions , and the numerical implementation of the exact kinematics in the small-@xmath2 formalism at one - loop order .",
    "we find that , with the exact kinematical constraint imposed , we can obtain two additional nlo hard factors , with one from the @xmath35 channel and the other from the @xmath36 channel .",
    "we first analytically show that these two terms are large enough to partially overcome the negative nlo terms found earlier in the simple golec - biernat and wusthoff ( gbw ) model  @xcite .",
    "numerically , these two terms are found to be negligible when @xmath33 , but they become important when @xmath1 rises to @xmath37 and higher .    more importantly , we have significantly improved our numerical implementation of all nlo corrections , which allows us to do phenomenological studies at the lhc energy .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the full nlo cross section and the forward hadron production data at the lhc .",
    "this paves the road for a quantitative and precise phenomenological test of saturation physics at the lhc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a detailed derivation of the implementation of the kinematical constraint into the dipole model , and obtain two additional nlo corrections ( one for the quark channel and one for the gluon channel ) after subtracting the corresponding small-@xmath2 large logarithms .",
    "we further evaluate these two terms by fourier transform , and demonstrate that they have the same @xmath38 behavior exhibited by perturbative qcd in the high @xmath1 limit .",
    "in particular , we analytically show that the additional terms are large compared to the negative cross section at nlo . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results and compare them to rhic and lhc results .",
    "we summarize our paper in sec . iv .",
    "let us first review the exact kinematical constraint discussed in previous publications  @xcite , since it plays an important role in this paper .",
    "we will continue to use light - cone perturbation theory as in refs .",
    "@xcite , and define @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the kinematical constraint is derived from the conservation of the @xmath41 component of the four momentum before and after interactions for @xmath42 processes . for quark production with transverse momentum @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ki ] , we obtain @xmath43 as @xmath44 approaches @xmath45 , the above kinematical constraint indicates @xmath46 for a rapidity divergent term , we find that the above constraint modifies the upper limit of the divergent integral as follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 according to the leading order kinematics . in the high energy limit",
    ", we assume @xmath49 which makes the second term very small .",
    "however , as we shall show in the following discussion , the @xmath50 term becomes important when @xmath1 gets larger than the typical saturation momentum .",
    "the direct evaluation of this @xmath50 term is not easy in the momentum space , but indirectly evaluating it in coordinate space is quite straightforward , as we shall demonstrate in the following discussion , after encoding it into the modified dipole splitting functions . , where @xmath51 is another hard scale ( e.g. the higgs mass or dijet invariant mass ) , is used to derive the sudakov factor when @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the sudakov physics is different from what we are discussing here , since basically the single hadron production process is a single scale problem .",
    "first of all , the new terms that we obtain can be never interpreted as a sudakov factor , instead it should be viewed as part of the nlo power correction . in addition , the color flow is completely different .",

    "the additional term of @xmath60 arises from the kinematical constraint , eq .  , imposed during the fourier transform .    in general",
    ", the correction to the splitting function @xmath61 does not play any important role since it vanishes when we take the high energy limit @xmath26 .",
    "it only becomes important when the gluon longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath62 approaches zero .",
    "specifically , for quark production at one - loop order , we always get the following dglap - type contribution from real diagrams : @xmath63 for the first term on the right hand side of the above equation , we can safely take the @xmath26 limit , since this term is regular when @xmath64 .",

    "therefore , we can use the integrated parton distributions in the proton projectile and use the small-@xmath2 evolution for the unintegrated gluon distribution in the nuclear target . on the other hand , in the middle rapidity region , @xmath201",
    ", we should use the small-@xmath2 evolution to resum both @xmath202 and @xmath203 simultaneously , since they are of the same order .",
    "this means that we need to do a complete nlo calculation in the framework of the so - called @xmath1 factorization with unintegrated parton distributions for both the proton projectile and the nuclear target .",
    "unfortunately , this calculation is very challenging , therefore we shall leave it to future studies .",
    "some more discussion and comments are in order , as follows .",
    "first of all , as we have shown analytically and numerically in the gbw model , the two additional nlo corrections derived in this work extend the applicability of the saturation physics calculation further into the large @xmath11 region , without significantly modifying the low @xmath11 results .",
    "the numerical results using the rcbk solution also support the same conclusion . in the very large @xmath11 region where the saturation effect is extremely small ,",
    "the full nlo cross section may still become negative , but this is already beyond the applicability of the saturation formalism . in this region",
    ", it is well - known that the collinear factorization is the relevant framework and provides the best description of the qcd dynamics .",
    "second , the comparison between the data and our calculation suggests that the implementation of the kinematical constraint works slightly better for the rcbk approach . as compared to the gbw model , the rcbk solution of the dipole scattering amplitude has the correct perturbative tail .",
    "last but not least , as shown in the numerical results , the negative cross section at nlo may still persist when @xmath11 of the measured hadron is much larger than the saturation momentum  @xmath5 .",
    "we recall the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : first , that the perturbative qcd calculation from collinear factorization can describe data in the large @xmath11 region ; and also , with exact kinematics ( which simply removes the plus function ) , the perturbative qcd calculation analytically matches the large-@xmath11 expansion of the results from small-@xmath2 factorization at next - to - leading order in @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , the nuclear modification factor @xmath205 measured in @xmath0 collisions at large @xmath11 ( @xmath206 ) becomes @xmath207{\\ensuremath{p_\\perp}}}{{\\ensuremath{n_{\\text{coll}}}}\\dd\\sigma^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{pp}}}}/\\dd { \\ensuremath{y}}\\dd[2]{\\ensuremath{p_\\perp } } } \\simeq \\frac{{\\ensuremath{s_\\perp}}^a { \\ensuremath{q_s}}^2(a)}{a { \\ensuremath{s_\\perp}}^p { \\ensuremath{q_s}}^2(p ) } = \\frac{xg^a(x)}{a xg^p(x)}\\simeq 1.\\ ] ] here the number of binary collisions @xmath208 is @xmath209 in @xmath0 collisions .",

    "these two terms were assumed to be negligible in the high energy limit @xmath26 in previous studies . in order to do more precise and reliable numerical calculations for phenomenological studies of saturation physics , we have to include these additional terms at finite center - of - mass energy @xmath25 . from an extensive phenomenological study",
    ", we found that these additional terms extend the applicability of the nlo cross section in the small-@xmath2 saturation physics formalism to higher values of the produced hadron momentum @xmath11 . matching to the perturbative collinear factorization",
    "will further extend the kinematic coverage of the theoretical predictions for this process  @xcite .    from the explicit nlo analysis of the single inclusive hadron spectrum in @xmath0 collisions",
    ", we argue that the nuclear modification factor @xmath205 shall approach @xmath45 at sufficient large transverse momentum , where the collinear factorization calculations apply to both @xmath4 and @xmath0 collisions . in the low transverse momentum region @xmath215",
    ", the small-@xmath2 factorization approach is the appropriate framework to compute inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions , where the gluon saturation effects can be systematically included .",
    "therefore , this process @xmath216 provides a unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between two important qcd dynamical effects ( small-@xmath2 resummation and the collinear factorization calculation ) in high energy hadronic reactions .    in our calculations , by including the kinematical constraint and the newly added nlo correction terms , we are able to improve the results of solo and achieve excellent agreement with the forward rapidity rhic data in @xmath217 collisions .",
    "furthermore , we have significantly improved the numerical accuracy of the solo package , which allows us to compute forward rapidity observables at lhc energy with small uncertainties and obtain remarkable agreement with the forward rapidity atlas data at @xmath181 in the relatively low-@xmath11 region .",
    "these results could be additional compelling evidence for the observation of the onset of saturation effects at the lhc .",
    "our results provide a benchmark framework for the small-@xmath2 saturation calculation for high energy processes in @xmath0 collisions at the next - to - leading order .",
    "recent theoretical developments have revolutionized the test of the saturation physics from the qualitative level to the quantitative level . with more and more experimental data available from the lhc",
    ", we will be able to tell whether and when gluon saturation has an effect at extremely small @xmath2 and large nucleus mass numbers .",
    "the theoretical advances in computing these processes at the next - to - leading order will be crucial to help identify the signature of gluon saturation phenomena . we expect more developments along the line discussed in this paper .",
    "phenomenologically , the solo program has been developed from a single - purpose program , for specific formulas under rhic conditions only , to a more general - purpose program that can easily be adapted to different expressions and produce results for both rhic and the lhc . during the development process , we have found an efficient method to perform the numeric computations involve .",
