    "since its discovery by mooradian in 1969 @xcite , photoluminescence of noble metals and , later , metal nanostructures has attracted increasing interest @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of metal photoluminescence ( mpl ) is radiative recombination of photoexcited d - band holes and upper - lying s - band electrons  a process strongly suppressed in the bulk by a plethora of nonradiative transitions in noble metals @xcite . in confined metal structures , mpl is considerably more efficient due to plasmon enhancement of radiative transitions @xcite . during the past decade ,",
    "a highly efficient single - photon and multiphoton - absorption - induced mpl was reported from various plasmonic systems including spherical nanoparticles ( np ) @xcite , nanorods @xcite , nanoshells @xcite , nanowires @xcite , and bowtie antennas @xcite .",
    "this continuing interest in plasmon - enhanced mpl is fueled , in large part , by its promising applications , e.g. , in imaging of blood vessels @xcite and cancer cells @xcite and optical recording @xcite .    in this letter , we present a microscopic theory of mpl from plasmonic nanostructures . to highlight the issue at hand , consider radiative recombination of a d - hole and an s - electron inside a spherical np of radius @xmath0 much smaller than the radiation wavelength @xmath1 . since d - holes in noble metals",
    "are strongly localized , this process can be viewed as radiation of a dipole located at the d - hole position @xmath2 .",
    "radiative decay rate of such a dipole , @xmath3 , is enhanced relative to free - space radiative decay rate , @xmath4 , by the local field factor @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , metal and outside medium dielectric functions .",
    "the factor ( [ rad ] ) has a peak when radiation frequency @xmath8 is close to surface plasmon frequency ; the latter is defined as the pole in np dipole polarizability , @xmath9 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ] .",
    "importantly , eq .  ( [ rad ] ) depends neither on np radius @xmath0 nor on d - hole position @xmath10 , thus implying universal mpl enhancement within wide np size range , @xmath11 .",
    "( a ) plasmon enhancement of d - hole radiative recombination for au np in water ( solid line ) and normalized absorption ( dashed line ) .",
    "( b ) auger plasmon excitation rate by a d - hole localized at the np center . ]    however , the experiment points to a more complicated picture .",
    "systematic studies of mpl size dependence for spherical nps @xcite revealed a strong emission reduction , by a factor 35 , for small np with diameters @xmath12 nm .",
    "furthermore , mpl from larger nps was reduced as well @xcite , and the brightest nps observed were those with @xmath13 nm @xcite . while for large nps , plasmon enhancement is expected to weaken due to the retardation effects , its decrease for smaller nps indicates that another mechanism , sensitive to np size , is at work . here",
    ", we identify this mechanism as _ excitation of auger plasmons by d - holes_.    namely , a localized d - hole can undergo a highly efficient _ nonradiative _ recombination with an s - electron accompanied by excitation of surface plasmons with _ high _ angular momenta @xmath14 .",
    "this process is analogous to the traditional d - hole auger scattering to s - band with a fermi sea electron ",
    "hole pair being excited except now collective , rather than single - particle , excitations populate the final state .",
    "importantly , the auger plasmon excitation rate , @xmath15 , strongly depends on the proximity of d - hole position @xmath10 to the metal boundary .",
    "for example , excitation of high-@xmath14 auger plasmons by a d - hole located near the center of a spherical np ( @xmath16 ) is suppressed by symmetry and only the dipole ( @xmath17 ) plasmon is excited with the rate @xcite @xmath18 ; but for a d - hole near np boundary ( @xmath19 ) , high-@xmath14 plasmons are efficiently excited causing @xmath15 increase by several orders of magnitude . in small nps , where even dipole auger plasmons are efficiently excited @xcite , the plasmon - assisted nonradiative decay rate @xmath15 can exceed ( on average ) the bulk decay rate @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to the _ size - dependent reduction _ of plasmon - enhanced mpl .",
    "in fact , d - hole radiative recombination is quenched near np boundary , and so the light emanates mainly from np central region .",
    "below we derive general expressions for mpl enhancement factor applicable to arbitrary metal nanostructures and present explicit formulas for a spherical np .",
    "our numerical calculations of mpl quantum efficiency ( qe ) for au np indicate that mpl from small nps is significantly reduced and that brightest nps are those with @xmath21 nm , in excellent agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , let us compare classical and microscopic descriptions of mpl enhancement mechanism .",
    "within the classical approach @xcite , the radiating dipole comprised of a d - hole and an s - electron is enhanced by the surface plasmon local field . within the microscopic approach @xcite , mpl enhancement is caused by the appearance of plasmon - mediated radiative decay channel : the d - hole recombines nonradiatively by exciting a surface plasmon @xcite which then decays radiatively , leaving a photon in the final state . within fermi golden rule",
    ", the photon emission rate is obtained by incorporating plasmons as intermediate states of the transition matrix element . naturally , both approaches yield the same enhancement factor ( [ rad ] ) for mpl intensity",
    ". however , excitation of high-@xmath14 auger plasmons with lifetime of @xmath2210 fs @xcite by localized d - holes provides a new nonradiative decay channel that can _ suppress _ mpl from small plasmonic structures .",
    "below , we incorporate auger plasmons excitation processes within a microscopic model for mpl .",
    "to specify the scope of our theory , let us elucidate the relevant processes within the standard three stage mpl model @xcite .",
    "initially , the incident light excites a nonequilibrium d - hole population which , during the second stage , undergoes fast energy and momentum relaxation due to electron  electron and electron  phonon scattering . during the third stage , those d - holes that relaxed to states with momenta @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the s - band fermi momentum , recombine with upper - lying s - band electrons via vertical ( in momentum space ) transitions [ see cartoon in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the overall mpl qe is given by the product @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the bulk qes for d - hole excitation , relaxation , and radiative recombination stages .",
    "the latter two stages are dominated by fast nonradiative processes in noble metals @xcite , including highly efficient ( in the absence of energy gap between d - band and s - band ) d - hole auger scattering , which quench d - hole momentum relaxation and radiative recombination and result in a very low bulk mpl qe of @xcite @xmath29 .    in plasmonic structures ,",
    "qes for individual mpl stages are independently modified . for excitation stage ,",
    "a change in @xmath26 can be substantial if some spectral overlap between the initial excitation and surface plasmon bands is present .",
    "here we assume , however , that the incident light frequency is either well above ( for single - photon - absorption - induced mpl@xcite ) or well below ( for multiphoton - absorption - induced mpl @xcite ) the plasmon band so that @xmath26 remains unaffected .",
    "the qe for fast relaxation stage , @xmath27 , is not directly affected by plasmons although the increased d - hole surface scattering may lead to faster momentum relaxation in small nanostructures @xcite . however , @xmath27 is significantly enhanced for multiphoton ( vs. single - photon ) excitation . indeed , the multiphoton d - hole excitation in noble metals is dominated by the following incoherent sequential process @xcite : an incident photon creates a vacancy in the s - band below the fermi level that is filled by a d - band electron promoted by a subsequent photon . in this way , d - holes are created with momenta predominantly below @xmath24 and hence need not undergo large momentum transfer before radiative recombination . in the absence of phase space restriction , @xmath27 drastically increases resulting in a highly efficient multiphoton - absorption - induced mpl @xcite .",
    "a quantitative description of the above mpl dynamics is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "here , we focus solely on the third ( recombination ) mpl stage , characterized by quantum efficiency @xmath30 that is strongly influenced by plasmons , and derive the qe enhancement factor , @xmath31 .",
    "we start with excitation of auger plasmons by a localized d - hole in a spherical metal np of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the decay rate of a photoexcited d - hole is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is d - hole self - energy due to electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions as well as interaction with light .",
    "in plasmonic nanostructures , the interactions between electrons ( and holes ) are described by dynamically - screened coulomb potential @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the bulk coulomb potential ( @xmath36 is the electron charge ) and @xmath37 contains contribution from surface excitations . in",

    "the full decay rate @xmath42 can be split into sum @xmath43 , where @xmath20 is bulk nonradiative decay rate , @xmath3 is plasmon - enhanced radiative decay rate , and @xmath15 is plasmon - assisted nonradiative decay rate .",
    "the latter is determined by the contribution to d - hole self - energy due to interband transitions under potential @xmath37 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the interband transition matrix element . to evaluate @xmath46",
    ", we adopt the tight - binding approach used for calculation of local field corrections to the dielectric function @xcite .",
    "first , we expand the d - hole bloch function in the wannier basis as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the localized hole wave - function for atomic position @xmath49 and @xmath50 is unit cell volume .",
    "note that , for a given d - hole position , only one term effectively contributes to the sum . in this basis , the matrix element of a smooth ( on atomic scale ) function @xmath51 between d - band and s - band states is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the interband dipole matrix element @xcite .",
    "the next step is to average @xmath54 over orientations of @xmath55 assuming isotropic angular distribution : @xmath56 . finally ,",
    "using the relation @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 the surface - induced decay rate @xmath59 peaks at frequencies satisfying @xmath60 indicating auger plasmon excitation .",

    "( [ chi ] ) , the plasmon contribution to @xmath33 plays no significant role due to the integration over off - resonant @xmath83-states , so that @xmath84 in eq .  (",

    "the local enhancement factor , @xmath85 , then takes the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 both , in general , depend on system geometry and d - hole position .",
    "the average enhancement factor , @xmath89 , is obtained by averaging the local enhancement factor @xmath90 over d - hole positions inside a nanostructure . here",
    "we note that d - holes _ spatial _ distribution stays largely unaffected during the fast relaxation stage , so we can adopt the normalized distribution function @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the absorbed power density , @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the local field at incident light frequency @xmath95 .",
