    "the non - planar atomic structure of selected @xmath0-bonded phosphorene allotropes is depicted in side and top view in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a - f ) .",
    "we find it convenient to map the 3d structure of a phosphorene monolayer with threefold coordinated atoms onto a 2d tiling pattern by assigning a triangular tile to each atom , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](g - i ) .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between structures and tiling patterns , so that different structures can be distinguished by different tiling patterns .",
    "dark - colored tiles are associated with atoms at the top and light - colored tiles with atoms at the bottom of the layer . since each atom has 3 neighbors , each triangular tile",
    "is surrounded by 3 neighboring tiles , @xmath1 of which have the same color .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath2 provides the atom associated with the central tile with a tetrahedral neighbor coordination associated with the favorable @xmath0 bonding . in our tiling model",
    ", @xmath6 would represent the planar structure of an energetically unfavorable @xmath3-bonded lattice that , according to our findings , would spontaneously convert to a non - planar @xmath0-bonded allotrope .    as we will show in the following , different allotropes with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 share similar characteristics .",
    "therefore , the structural index @xmath1 is useful for primary categorization of the allotropes . in each structure",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath1 maintains an identical value throughout the lattice , keeping the favorable @xmath0 bonding at all sites .",
    "we believe that this is the underlying reason for our finding that these structures are nearly equally stable.@xcite     and @xmath9 phosphorene allotropes in top view ( a - b ) and the corresponding tiling model representation ( c - d ) .",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath10-p allotrope in ( a , c ) and the @xmath9 allotrope in ( b , d ) are structurally different from the allotropes with the same @xmath1 in fig .",
    "primitive unit cells are emphasized by shading and delimited by black dashed lines .",
    "atoms at the top and bottom of the layer , as well as the corresponding tiles , are distinguished by color .",
    "the two different orientations of bonds between like atoms , indicated by the double arrows as guides to the eye , are denoted by `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' . [ fig2 ] ]    in the first category characterized by @xmath7 , all neighbors of a given atom have the same , but different height within the layer , as seen in figs .  [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](d ) .",
    "this translates into a tiling pattern , where all adjacent tiles have a different color , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](g ) .",
    "there is only one structural realization within the @xmath7 category , namely the blue - p allotrope .    in the second category characterized by @xmath8 ,",
    "each atom has one like neighbor at the same height and two unlike neighbors at a different height within the layer , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](e ) . besides the @xmath4-p structure in fig .",

    "each diamond , formed of two adjacent like - colored triangles , is surrounded by unlike - colored diamonds . as a guide to the eye",

    "[ fig1](h ) could be characterized by the sequence `` @xmath13 '' and the structure of @xmath10-p by the sequence `` @xmath14 '' , an infinite number of different sequences including `` @xmath15 '' would result in an infinite number of @xmath8 phosphorene structures .",
    "the most stable and best - known phosphorene allotrope is black - p , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](f ) .",
    "each atom in this structure has two like neighbors at the same height and one unlike neighbor at a different height , yielding a structural index @xmath9 .",
    "the tiling model of this structure type , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](i ) , contains contiguous arrays of like - colored diamonds .",
    "these arrays may be either straight , as in fig .",

    "[ fig1](i ) by the sequence `` @xmath13 '' and @xmath5-p in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) by the sequence `` @xmath14 '' . as in the case of @xmath8 ,",
    "an infinite number of different sequences including `` @xmath15 '' would result in an infinite number of @xmath9 phosphorene structures .",
    "the structural similarity and energetic near - degeneracy of @xmath9 and @xmath8 structures stems from the fact that a structural change from @xmath9 to @xmath8 involves only a horizontal shift of every other row , indicated by the horizontal lines in figs .",

    "it is even possible to generate structural domains with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the energy cost of domain wall boundaries may be extremely low@xcite if optimum @xmath0 bonding is maintained at the boundaries .",
    "as mentioned above , there is only one allotrope with @xmath7 , but infinitely many structures with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . of these",
    ", we identified and optimized all lattices with up to 28 atoms per primitive unit cell and selected other structures with up to 32 atoms per unit cell . for each lattice , we identified the relative stability @xmath16 with respect to the most stable black phosphorene allotrope on a per - atom basis and plotted the values in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the electronic band structure of systems with large unit cells is very dense and hard to interpret in comparison to that of the allotropes discussed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , which is reproduced in the supporting information.@xcite for each of these structures , though , we identified the value @xmath17 of the fundamental band gap and provide the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .    we find that neither @xmath16 nor @xmath17 display a general dependence on the size of the unit cell .",
    "we found all structures to be relatively stable .",
    "the small values @xmath18  ev / atom indicate a likely coexistence of different allotropes that would form under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "all band gap values , which are typically underestimated in dft - pbe calculations , occur in the range between @xmath19  ev and @xmath20  ev , similar to the allotropes discussed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "rather surprisingly , the distribution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 values , shown in the right panels of the sub - figures fig .  [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) , exhibits three peaks that can be associated with the structural index @xmath1 , with a rather narrow variance caused by the differences between the allotrope structures .",
    "we find the energetically near - degenerate blue phosphorene ( @xmath7 with 2 atoms per unit cell ) and black phosphorene ( @xmath9 with 4 atoms per unit cell ) structures to be the most stable , followed by other @xmath9 structures with more than 4 atoms per unit cell .",
    "we found @xmath8 structures to be the least stable of all .",
    "similarly , the @xmath7 blue phosphorene allotrope has the largest band gap , @xmath9 allotropes have the smallest band gap , and @xmath8 allotropes lie in between .",
    "the higher stability of @xmath9 phosphorene structures in comparison to @xmath8 allotropes indicates an energetic preference for phosphorus atoms forming zigzag chains at the same height rather than forming isolated dimers . among the @xmath9 structures , @xmath5-p is the least stable , with @xmath21  ev / atom .",
    "all the other @xmath9 structures fall in - between @xmath5-p and black phosphorus in terms of stability .",
    "this finding is easy to understand , since all these structures are combination of black phosphorus and @xmath5-p .    for both @xmath9 and @xmath8 allotropes",
    ", we find structures with the same orientation of diamonds in the tiling pattern to be more stable .",
    "the @xmath4-p structure , with all diamonds aligned in the same direction in the tiling pattern , is the most stable @xmath8 phosphorene allotrope , but still less stable by @xmath22  ev / atom than the @xmath9 black phosphorene . at the other extreme of the relative stability range ,",
    "@xmath10-p with disordered diamond orientations in the tiling pattern is the least stable @xmath8 allotrope , being @xmath23  ev / atom less stable than black phosphorene . in analogy to what we concluded for @xmath9 structures , all @xmath8 phosphorene allotropes can be viewed as a combination of @xmath4-p and @xmath10-p , with their stability in - between the above limiting values .    as mentioned above , also the distribution of @xmath17 values , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , indicates three distinct groups that can be associated with the structural index @xmath1 .",
    "the largest band gap value of @xmath20  ev in the only @xmath7 structure , blue phosphorene , is well separated from the band gap distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 structures that form a double - hump shape .",
    "we note that the two peaks in the band gap distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 allotropes are not as well separated as the two peaks in the stability distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , so the trends in the band gap value are not as clear as trends in the relative stability . in systems with large unit cells ,",
    "band gaps of @xmath8 structures are grouped around @xmath24  ev , whereas band gaps of @xmath9 structures are grouped around @xmath25  ev .",
    "the largest spread in @xmath17 values is in systems with very small unit cells . among @xmath8 allotropes ,",
    "we find the smallest value @xmath26  ev in the structure with 4 atoms / unit cell ( @xmath4-p ) and the largest value @xmath27  ev in the structure with 8 atoms / unit cell ( @xmath10-p ) .",
    "band gap values of other @xmath8 structures range between these two values .",
    "@xmath9 structures have generally the lowest band gap values of the three groups . among @xmath9 systems , we find the largest value @xmath28  ev in the structure with 4 atoms / unit cell ( black phosphorene ) and @xmath29  ev in a system with 8 atoms / unit cell , the smallest gap value among several metastable structures of @xmath5-p .",
    "band gap values of other @xmath9 structures range between these two values .",
    "as discussed earlier,@xcite our pbe - based band gap values are generally underestimated .",
    "more precise quasiparticle calculations beyond dft , including the gw formalism , indicate that the band gap values should be about @xmath30  ev larger than the pbe values presented here.@xcite    as the unit cell size of @xmath8 and @xmath9 structures grows infinitely large , we gradually approach amorphous phosphorene . assuming that our findings in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are universal and not limited to the finite sizes addressed by our study , we conclude that the stability and the fundamental band gap of such amorphous structures should also be found in the range suggested by their structural index @xmath1 .",
    "the one - to - one mapping between 3d structures of periodic systems and 2d tiling patterns is not limited to a honeycomb lattice with 6-membered rings , but can equally well be applied to lattices with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36membered rings found in planar haeckelites.@xcite the corresponding geometries and tiling patterns are shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] . among these structures ,",
    "4 - 8 phosphorene has the highest symmetry , a relatively small unit cell with the shape of a square and a tiling pattern composed of right triangles . besides the @xmath7 structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , we can identify allotropes with 4 - 8 rings with structural indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "other allotropes with 3 - 12 , 5 - 7 and 5 - 8 rings , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4](b - d ) , may not exist in all the variants of the structural index @xmath1 due to their lower symmetry .",
    "for example , the allotrope with 5 - 7 rings does not have a structure with @xmath7 .",
    "we find structures with non - hexagonal rings to be generally less stable than the most stable black phosphorene , but the energy differences @xmath37  ev / atom are very small .",
    "consequently , we expect that such structures should coexist with black phosphorene as either pure phases , or as local defects at domain wall boundaries , or as finite - size domains in the host layer .",
    "we find all phosphorene allotropes with non - hexagonal rings to be semiconducting , with the band gap determined primarily by the structural index @xmath1 .",
    "and ( b ) a @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "edges of the finite - size flakes are terminated by hydrogen atoms , colored in white .",
    "the color of the phosphorus atoms and the corresponding tiles distinguishes positions at the top or the bottom of the layer .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    phosphorene may also form aperiodic structures with no translational symmetry .",
    "examples of such systems with only rotational symmetry are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) depicts a phosphorene structure of type @xmath9 with a @xmath39 point group symmetry and the corresponding tiling pattern . in this structure ,",
    "arrays of neighboring atoms form an alternating circular pattern about the center that can cover an infinite plane . the analogous @xmath9 structure with @xmath38 symmetry is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , and analogous structures with @xmath40 symmetry could be imagined as well . to judge the stability of these aperiodic structures , we optimized finite - size flakes that were terminated by hydrogen atoms at the exposed edge .",
    "we found these structures to be semiconducting and as stable as the periodic structures discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , with @xmath41  ev / atom for the @xmath39 and @xmath42  ev / atom for the @xmath38 structure falling into range expected for @xmath9 .",
    "these findings indicate that our classification scheme and tiling model is useful to characterize monolayers of three - fold coordinated , @xmath0-hybridized phosphorus atoms arranged in periodic or aperiodic patterns . due to structural similarities between layered structures of group - v elements",
    ", we believe that our findings regarding relative stability , electronic structure and fundamental band gap will likely also apply to other systems including monolayers of arsenic , antimony and bismuth .",
    "since the cohesive energy differences are rather small , we must consider the possibility that the stability ranking of the different allotropes at @xmath43 and related properties@xcite may depend on the dft functional .",
    "we have compared pbe results for the relative stability of the different allotropes with lda results and found the maximum difference in the relative stabilities of the different allotropes to be @xmath44  ev / atom , which does not change the energy ranking of the allotropes .",
    "since phosphorene structures will likely be synthesized at nonzero temperatures , the relative abundance of different allotropes will depend on their free energy at that temperature .",
    "consequently , our total energy results for stability differences at @xmath43 need to be corrected by also addressing differences in entropy at @xmath45 . even though the decrease in free energy with increasing temperature should be similar in the different allotropes due to their similar vibration spectra",
    ", minute differences in vibrational entropy may become important in view of the small differences between stabilities of the allotropes at @xmath43 , and could eventually change the free energy ranking at high temperatures .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have introduced a scheme to categorize the structure of different layered phosphorene allotropes by mapping the non - planar 3d structure of three - fold coordinated p atoms onto a two - color 2d triangular tiling pattern . in the buckled structure of a phosphorene monolayer",
    ", we assign atoms in `` top '' positions to dark tiles and atoms in `` bottom '' positions to light tiles .",
    "we found that optimum @xmath0 bonding is maintained throughout the structure when each triangular tile is surrounded by the same number @xmath1 of like - colored tiles , with @xmath2 .",
    "our _ ab initio _ density functional calculations indicate that both the relative stability and electronic properties depend primarily on the structural index @xmath1 .",
    "common characteristics of allotropes with identical @xmath1 suggest the usefulness of the structural index for categorization . the proposed mapping approach may also be applied to phosphorene structures with non - hexagonal rings and to 2d quasicrystals with no translational symmetry , which we predict to be nearly as stable as the hexagonal network .",
    "our computational approach to gain insight into the equilibrium structure , stability and electronic properties of various phosphorene structures is based on _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the siesta@xcite .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions throughout the study .",
    "we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite exchange - correlation functional , norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials@xcite , and a double-@xmath46 basis including polarization orbitals .",
    "selected pbe results were compared to results based on the local density approximation ( lda )  .",
    "the reciprocal space was sampled by a fine grid@xcite of @xmath47  @xmath48-points in the brillouin zone of the primitive unit cell .",
    "we used a mesh cutoff energy of @xmath49  ry to determine the self - consistent charge density , which provided us with a precision in total energy of @xmath50 2  mev / atom .",
    "all geometries have been optimized by siesta using the conjugate gradient method@xcite , until none of the residual hellmann - feynman forces exceeded @xmath51  ev /  .",
