    "starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) are galaxies in which star formation occurrs at a rate significantly higher than a typical galactic rate .",
    "the main interest for studying sbgs in the local universe stems from the belief that the starburst phase must have been very frequent during the early ( @xmath4 ) evolution of galaxies ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; heckman 1999 ) .",
    "thus understanding the properties of local sbgs would help in the characterization of galaxies in the early universe .",
    "studies of sbgs can also help to shed light on key astrophysical issues such as : _",
    "i ) _ the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by metal - enriched starburst - driven outflows ( heckman 1998 ) , _ ii ) _ the formation , evolution and structure of galaxies through the feedback effect provided by massive stars in the forms of radiation , mechanical energy , cosmic rays and metal - rich material ( ikeuchi & norman 1991 ) ; and _ iii ) _ the agn / starburst connection , since both phenomena require concentration of material in the nuclear regions and are possibly linked to merging phenomena and/or the presence of molecular bars ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "evidence for complex galactic - scale outflows driven by starburst activity has been gathered in recent years .",
    "it is primarily based on optical and low - energy x - ray ( @xmath3 0.13 kev : hereafter lex ) observations ( fabbiano 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "these outflows have sometimes been called `` superbubbles '' or `` superwinds '' , the latter referring to those manifestations where the extended hot gas , that emits optical emission lines and lex emission , appears to be ejected into the igm .",
    "optical emission usually suffers from extinction and is often almost completely reprocessed into infrared ( ir ) radiation : therefore the x - ray data , when available , provide the most direct view of the hot wind material . in general , results of spectroscopic x - ray studies confirm or , at least , are consistent with thermal emission from a hot plasma most likely shock - heated by supernovae ( e.g. dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 : hereafter dwh98 ) .",
    "however , the detailed physical characteristics of the gas in particular its chemical abundances have remained unclear because the analysis in the lex band is complicated by the unknown line - of - sight extinction , the large uncertainties in the theoretical models used ( in particular around the fel - shell energy band ) , and the presence of multiple temperature components ( typically with 0.2 kev @xmath5 3 kev ) .    at higher energies , available imaging information to date",
    "was essentially limited to the _ exosat _ observation of m82 ( schaaf et al . 1989 ) and to the _ asca _ observations of a few x - ray bright sbgs [ ngc 253 , m82 : ptak et al .",

    "; ngc 1569 , ngc4449 , ngc2146 : della ceca et al . 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ] .",
    "schaaf et al . (",
    "1989 ) found that the @xmath3110 kev spectrum of m82 was equally well fit with a @xmath6 power - law spectrum or with thermal emission characterized by @xmath7 kev .",
    "_ asca _ was able to resolve the 210 kev emission from ngc 253 ( p97 ) but not that from m82 ( tsuru et al . 1997 ) .",
    "adequate spatial analysis was not possible even in the case of ngc253 .",
    "analysis of the _ asca _ spectra shows that the hard x - ray ( hereafter hex ) components of both sources can be described equally well by either a thermal ( @xmath89 kev ) or a power - law ( @xmath9 1.82.0 ) model . the puzzling absence , in the previous data , of significant fe - k line emission induced several authors to favour the power - law model : this was interpreted in the framework of either a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) ( p97 ; tsuru et al .",
    "1997 ; matsumoto & tsuru 1999 ) or of compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the intense fir ( @xmath10 , see telesco & harper 1980 ) radiation field ( rephaeli et al .",
    "1991 ; rephaeli & goldshmidt 1995 ; moran & lehnert 1997 ) .    in a previous paper ( persic et al . 1998 ) , we have presented the _ bepposax _ spectral results for the central region of ngc 253 , which have given the first evidence of the 6.7 kev fe - k line emission and of the high - energy rollover expected as the signature of thermal emission . in this paper , we present the results obtained from the temporal ( sect .",
    "3 ) , spatial ( sect .",
    "4 ) , and spectral ( sect . 5 , 6 and 7 )",
    "analysis of the _ bepposax _ data for both ngc 253 and m82 . as will be shown ,",
    "our results suggest a predominantly thermal origin of the hex component in both sources .",
    "the possible origin(s ) and implications of such emission are then briefly discussed ( sect .",
    "in what follows , we assume a distance of 4.8 mpc and 3.9 mpc to ngc 253 and to m82 , respectively .",
    "_ bepposax _ consists of a low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs : parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) , a medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs : boella et al .",
    "1997 ) , a high - pressure - gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc : manzo et al . 1997 ) , and a phoswich detector system ( pds : frontera et al . 1997 ) .",
    "_ bepposax _ observed ngc 253 on nov.29  dec.02 , 1996 and m82 on dec .",
    "6 - 7 , 1997 .",
    "the hpgspc data will not be considered in the present paper since the sources are too faint for a correct background subtraction .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the 0.14.5 kev and 1.510 kev energy bands for the lecs and mecs , respectively , where the latest released ( september 1997 ) response matrices are best calibrated ( fiore , guainazzi & grandi 1998 ) .",
    "table 1 reports the log of the observations , with the corresponding exposure times and derived net ( background - subtracted ) count - rates .",
    "the region sizes ( table 1 ) are chosen in order to minimize the effects of the extended emission in ngc 253 and to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio in m82 ( but see also sect .",
    "standard blank - sky files provided by the _ bepposax _",
    "science data center were used for background subtraction , and contributed about 10% ( ngc 253 ) and 7% ( m 82 ) of the total counts at 6 kev .",
    "the pds data reduction was performed using the xas software package ( v.2.0 : chiappetti & dal fiume 1997 ) .",
    "the pds nominal spectral band is 13300 kev .",
    "the detection of both sources is _ statistically _ significant ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , when account is taken of the @xmath3 0.02 cts / s systematic uncertainty , we find that only for m82 is the detection formally significant ( at @xmath3 4@xmath11 ) , and only up to @xmath330 kev . in the case of ngc 253 ,",
    "no contaminating sources were found either in the pds field of view ( fov ; which has a triangular response with fwhm of @xmath3 1.3@xmath12 , see frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) , nor in the background regions pointed at @xmath13 3.5 degrees from the source position ( following the so - called rocking collimator mode ) .",
    "also in the case of m82 , no contaminating sources were found in the background fov .",
    "however , the liner galaxy m81 is only @xmath3 37@xmath14 away from m82 so that , given the pds triangular response , the measured emission includes half of the m81 flux .",
    "observation of m81 ( pellegrini et al . 1999 ) performed in june 1998 indicates that the source was then well fit by a steep ( @xmath15 @xmath16 1.8 @xmath13 0.1 ) power - law spectrum from 0.1 to 100 kev and had a 1050 kev flux of @xmath3 4 @xmath17 10@xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 .",
    "since the 1050 kev flux of m82 is 1.7 @xmath17 10@xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 , it seems that most of the e@xmath2110 kev flux observed from the m82 fov originates in m81 .",
    "the spectrum of m82 , obtained by fitting the pds data only is , however , much steeper ( @xmath15 @xmath16 3.8 @xmath13 1.4 ) than that of m81 which implies only marginal or no contamination at all .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the x - ray flux of m81 is known to have varied by at least a factor of 4 on a timescale of months / years ( pellegrini et al . 1999 ; iyomoto 1999 ) , prevents us from claiming the pds detection of m82 5.9 @xmath17 10@xmath18 ergs @xmath22 s@xmath20 ) .",
    "all this body of evidence suggest that either m81 or m82 do vary significantly at high energies . ] .",
    "a conservative approach is thus to consider the m82 pds data as upper limits , as will be done in the rest of this paper .",
