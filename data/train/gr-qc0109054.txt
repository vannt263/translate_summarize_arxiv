    "as we enter the new millennium there is a focused worldwide effort to construct devices that will enable the first undisputed detection of gravitational waves . a network of large - scale ground - based laser - interferometer detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 ) is due to come on - line soon , and the sensitivity of the several resonant mass detectors that are already in operation continues to be improved .",
    "an integral part in this effort is played by theoretical modeling of the expected sources .",
    "theorists are presently racking their brains to think of various sources of gravitational waves that may be observable once the new ultra - sensitive detectors operate at their optimum level , and of any piece of information one may be able to extract from such observations .",
    "the theory of stellar pulsation is richly endowed with interesting phenomena , and ever improving observations suggest that most stars exhibit complicated modes of oscillation . thus it is natural to try to match theoretical models to observed data in order to extract information about the dynamics of distant stars .",
    "this interplay between observations and stellar pulsation theory is known as asteroseismology .",
    "one of the most challenging goals that can ( at least , in principle ) be achieved via gravitational - wave detection is the determination of the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities .",
    "we have recently argued that observed gravitational waves from the various nonradial pulsation modes of a neutron star can be used to infer both the mass and the radius of the star with surprisingly good accuracy , and thus put useful constraints on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear that astrophysical mechanisms can excite the various oscillation modes to a detectable level .",
    "it seems likely that only the most violent processes , such as the actual formation of a neutron star following a supernova or a dramatic starquake following , for example , an internal phase - transition , will be of relevance .",
    "the strengthening evidence for magnetars @xcite , in which a starquake could release large amounts of energy , is also very interesting in this respect .",
    "one can estimate that these events must take place in our immediate neighborhood ( the milky way or the local group ) in order to be observable .",
    "the spectrum of a pulsating relativistic star is known to be tremendously rich , but most of the associated pulsation modes are of little relevance for gravitational - wave detection . from the gravitational - wave point of view",
    "one would expect the most important modes ( in addition to the unstable @xmath0-modes @xcite ) to be the fundamental ( @xmath1 ) mode of fluid oscillation , the first few pressure ( @xmath2 ) modes and the first gravitational - wave ( @xmath3 ) modes @xcite . for more details on the theory of relativistic stellar pulsation",
    "we refer the reader to two recent review articles @xcite .",
    "that the bulk of the energy from an oscillating neutron star is , indeed , radiated through these modes has been demonstrated by numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "consequently it is relevant to try to device a strategy for detecting gravitational waves from pulsating neutron stars , and see what information such a detection could provide regarding the stars parameters .",
    "such a strategy can potentially be of great importance to gravitational - wave astronomy , since most stars are expected to oscillate nonradially . in principle",
    ", one would expect the modes of a star to be excited in any dynamical scenario that leads to significant asymmetries .",
    "of course , one can only hope to observe gravitational waves from the most compact stars ( neutron stars and possibly strange stars ) and only the most violent processes are of interest .",
    "still , there are several scenarios in which the various pulsation modes may be excited to an interesting level : ( a ) a supernova explosion is expected to form a wildly pulsating neutron star that emits gravitational waves .",
    "the current estimates for the energy radiated as gravitational waves from supernovae is rather pessimistic , suggesting a total release of the equivalent to @xmath4 , or so .",
    "however , this may be a serious underestimate if the gravitational collapse in which the neutron star is formed is strongly non - spherical .",
    "optimistic estimates suggest that as much as @xmath5 may be released in extreme events .",
    "( b ) another potential excitation mechanism for stellar pulsation is a starquake , e.g. , associated with a pulsar glitch .",
    "the typical energy released in this process may be of the order of the maximum mechanical energy that can be stored in the crust , estimated to be at the level of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is also an interesting possibility considering the recent suggestion that the soft - gamma repeaters are magnetars , neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields @xcite , that undergo frequent starquakes .",
    "it seems very likely that some pulsation modes are excited by the rather dramatic events that lead to the most energetic bursts seen from these systems .",
    "indeed , duncan @xcite has recently argued that toroidal modes in the crust should be excited .",
    "if modes are excited in these systems , an indication of the energy released in the most powerful bursts is the @xmath7 estimated for the march 5 1979 burst in sgr  0526 - 66 .",
    "the maximum energy should certainly not exceed the total supply in the magnetic field @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that a burst from a soft gamma - ray repeater may have a gravitational - wave analogue is very exciting .",
    "( c ) the coalescence of two neutron stars at the end of binary inspiral may form a pulsating remnant .",
    "it is , of course , most likely , that a black hole is formed when two neutron stars coalesce , but even in that case the eventual collapse may be halted long enough ( many dynamical timescales ) that several oscillation modes could potentially be identified @xcite .",
    "also , stellar oscillations can be excited by the tidal fields of the two stars during the inspiral phase that precedes the merger @xcite .",
    "( d ) the star may undergo a dramatic phase - transition that leads to a mini - collapse .",
    "this would be the result of a sudden softening of the equation of state ( for example , associated with the formation of a condensate consisting of pions or kaons ) .",
    "a phase - transition could lead to a sudden contraction during which a considerable part of the stars gravitational binding energy would be released , and it seems inevitable that part of this energy would be channeled into pulsations of the remnant .",
    "large amounts of energy that could be released in the most extreme of these scenarios : a contraction of ( say ) 10% can easily lead to the release of @xmath5 .",
    "transformation of a neutron star into a strange star is likely to induce pulsations in a similar fashion .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the bulk of the total energy of the oscillation is released through a few of the stars quadrupole pulsation modes in all of these scenarios .",
    "we will assume that this is the case and assess the likelihood that the associated gravitational waves will be detected .",
    "having done this we discuss the inverse problem , and investigate how accurately the neutron star parameters can be inferred from the gravitational wave data .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the gravitational - wave driven instability of the so - called @xmath0-modes .",
    "a neutron star has a large number of families of pulsation modes with more or less distinct character . for the simplest stellar models , the relevant modes are high frequency pressure @xmath2-modes and the low frequency gravity @xmath9-modes @xcite . for a typical nonrotating neutron star model the fundamental @xmath2-mode ( usually referred to as the @xmath1-mode )",
    ", whose eigenfunction has no nodes in the star , has frequency in the range 2 - 4  khz , while the first overtone lies above @xmath10  khz .",
    "the @xmath9-modes depend sensitively on the internal composition and temperature distribution , but they typically have frequencies of a few hundred hz . the standard mode - classification dates back to the seminal work of cowling @xcite , and is based on identifying the main restoring force that influences the fluid motion . as the stellar model is made more detailed and further restoring forces",
    "are included new families of modes come into play .",
    "for example , a neutron star model with a sizeable solid crust separating a thin ocean from a central fluid region will have @xmath9-modes associated with both the core and the ocean as well as modes associated with shearing motion in the crust@xcite .",
    "of particular interest to relativists is the existence of a class of modes uniquely associated with the spacetime itself @xcite ; the so - called @xmath3-modes ( for gravitational ave ) .",
    "these modes essentially arise because the curvature of spacetime that is generated by the background density distribution can temporarily trap impinging gravitational waves .",
    "the @xmath3-modes typically have high frequencies ( above 6  khz ) and damp out in a fraction of a millisecond .",
    "it is not yet clear whether one should expect these modes to be excited to an appreciable level during ( say ) a gravitational collapse following a supernova .",
    "one might argue that they provide a natural channel for the release of any initial deformation of the spacetime , but there are as yet no solid evidence indicating a significant level of @xmath3-mode excitation in a realistic scenario @xcite .",
    "once gravitational waves are detected the first task will be to identify the source .",
    "this should be possible from the general character of the waveform and may not require very accurate theoretical models , but such models will be of crucial importance for a deduction of the parameters of the source .",
    "that is , for gravitational - wave `` astronomy '' .",
    "the idea behind this presentation is a familiar one in astronomy : for many years , studies of the light variation of variable stars have been used to deduce their internal structure @xcite .",
    "the newtonian theory of stellar pulsation was to a large extent developed in order to explain the pulsations of cepheids and rr lyrae .",
    "this approach , known as asteroseismology ( helioseismology in the specific case of the sun ) , has been remarkably successful in recent years . in comparison",
    ", the relativistic theory of stellar pulsation , which has now been developed for thirty years , has not yet been applied in a similar way .",
    "so far , the relativistic theory has no immediate connections to observations ( that are not already provided by the newtonian theory ) .",
    "we believe that this situation will change once the gravitational - wave window to the universe is opened , and in this review we discuss how the information carried by the gravitational - wave signal can be inverted to estimate the parameters of pulsating stars .",
    "that is , we take a first step towards gravitational - wave asteroseismology .",
    "our present understanding of neutron stars comes mainly from x - ray and radio - timing observations .",
    "these observations provide some insight into the structure of these objects and the properties of supranuclear matter .",
    "the most commonly and accurately observed parameter is the rotation period , and we know that radio pulsars can spin very fast ( the shortest observed period being the 1.56 ms of psr 1937 + 21 ) .",
    "another basic observable , that can be obtained ( in a few cases ) with some accuracy from todays observations , is the mass of the neutron star .",
    "as finn @xcite has shown , the observations of radio pulsars indicate that the mass lies in the range @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , van der kerkwijk et al @xcite find that data for x - ray pulsars indicate that @xmath12 .",
    "the data used in these two studies is actually consistent with ( if one includes error bars ) @xmath13 .",
    "we now recall that the various eos that have been proposed by theoretical physicists can be divided into two major categories : i ) the `` soft '' eos which typically lead to neutron star models with maximum masses around @xmath14 and radii usually smaller than 10 km , and ii ) the `` stiff '' eos with maximum values @xmath15 and @xmath16 km @xcite .",
    "we thus see that , even though the constraint put on the neutron star mass by present observations seems strong , it actually does not rule out many of the proposed eos . in order to arrive at a more useful result we are likely to need detailed observations also of the stellar radius .",
    "unfortunately , available data provide little information about the radius .",
    "the recent observations of quasiperiodic oscillations in low mass x - ray binaries indicate that @xmath17 , but again this is not a severe constraint .",
    "although a number of attempts have been made , using either x - ray observations @xcite or the limiting spin period of neutron stars @xcite , to put constraints on the mass - radius relation , we do not yet have a method which can provide the desired answer .",
    "in view of this situation , any method that can be used to infer neutron star parameters is a welcome addition . of specific interest",
    "may be the new possibilities offered once gravitational - wave observations become reality .",
    "let us suppose that a nearby supernova explodes , say in the local group of galaxies , and is followed by a core collapse that leads to the formation of a compact object .",
    "as the dust from the collapse settles the compact object pulsates wildly in its various oscillation modes , generating a gravitational - wave signal which is composed of an overlapping of different frequencies .",
    "we will assume that the results of allen et al .",
    "@xcite can be brought to bear on this situation , i.e. that most of the energy is radiated through the @xmath1-mode , a few @xmath2-modes and the first @xmath3-mode .",
    "our detector picks up this signal , and a subsequent fourier analysis of the data stream yields the frequencies and the energy carried by each mode .    the first question to be answered by the gravitational - wave astronomer concerns what kind of compact object could produce the detected signal .",
    "is it a black hole or a neutron star ?",
    "the pulsation of these objects lead to qualitatively similar gravitational waves , eg .",
    "exponentially damped oscillations , but the question should nevertheless be relatively easy to answer . if more than one of the stellar pulsation modes is observed the answer is clear , but even if we only observe only one single mode the two cases should be easy to distinguish .",
    "the fundamental ( quadrupole ) quasinormal mode frequency of a schwarzschild black hole follows from @xmath18 while the associated e - folding time is @xmath19 that is , the oscillations of a 10 @xmath20 black hole lie in the frequency range of the @xmath1-mode for a typical neutron star .",
    "but the two signals will differ greatly in the damping time , the e - folding time of the black hole being nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than that of the neutron star @xmath1-mode .    having excluded the possibility that our signal came from a black hole",
    ", we want to know the mass and the radius of the newly born neutron star .",
    "we also want to decide which of the proposed eos that best represents this star . to address these questions",
    "we can use a set of empirical relations that can be used to estimate the mass , the radius and the eos of the neutron star with good precision .      considering the possibility of a future detection",
    "it is relevant to pose the `` inverse problem '' for gravitational waves from pulsating stars .",
    "once we have observed the waves , can we deduce the details of the star from which they originated ? to answer this question",
    "we have calculated the frequencies and damping times of the modes that we expect to lead to the strongest gravitational waves for a selection of eos .",
    "nearly twenty years ago lindblom and detweiler @xcite tabulated the frequencies and damping times of the @xmath1-mode for a number of eos .",
    "recently we @xcite extended their calculation by adding more recent eos and providing data also for the @xmath3- and @xmath2- modes .",
    "these numerical data were then used to to create useful `` empirical '' relations between the `` observables '' ( frequencies and damping times ) and the parameters of the star ( mass , radius and possibly the eos ) . we will now outline how these relations can be used to infer the stellar parameters from detected mode data .",
    "let us first consider the frequency of the @xmath1-mode .",
    "it is well known that the characteristic time - scale of any dynamical process is related to the mean density ( @xmath21 ) of the mass involved .",
    "this notion should be relevant for the fluid oscillation modes of a star , and we consequently expect that @xmath22 .",
    "that is , we should normalize the @xmath1-mode frequency with the average density of the star . as shown in @xcite",
    "the relation between the @xmath1-mode frequencies and the mean density is almost linear , and a linear fitting leads to the following simple relation : @xmath23 where we have introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath24 from equation ( [ rfw ] ) follows that the typical @xmath1-mode frequency is around 2.4 khz .    to deduce a similar relation for the damping rate of the @xmath1-mode",
    ", we can use the rough estimate given by the quadrupole formula .",
    "that is , the damping time should follow from @xmath25 using this relation and the numerical results for the damping time of the @xmath1-mode for various stellar parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we find that @xcite : @xmath28 \\label{rftau}\\ ] ] and it follows that the typical damping time of the @xmath1-mode is around 0.15 sec .",
    "analogous empirical relations for the @xmath2-mode data are much less robust and useful .",
    "this is natural since the @xmath2-modes are sensitive to changes in the matter distribution inside the star ( as manifested through changes in the sound speed ) .",
    "in contrast , the gravitational - wave @xmath3-modes lead to very robust results .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the @xmath3-modes do not excite a significant fluid motion .",
    "thus , they are more or less independent of the characteristics of the fluid : the frequencies do not depend on the sound speed and the damping times can not be modeled by the quadrupole formula .",
    "analytic results for model problems for the @xmath3-modes @xcite , show that the frequency of the @xmath3-mode is inversely proportional to the size of the star .",
    "meanwhile , the damping time is related to the compactness of the star , i.e. the more relativistic the star is the longer the @xmath3-mode oscillation lasts .",
    "these properties have already been discussed in some detail in @xcite for uniform density stars .",
    "one can find the following relations for the frequency and damping of the first @xmath3-mode : @xmath29 \\ , \\label{rww}\\ ] ] and @xmath30 \\ .",
    "\\label{rwtau}\\ ] ] we see that a typical value for the @xmath3-mode frequency is 11 - 12 khz , but since the frequency depends strongly on the radius of the star it varies greatly for different eos . for example ,",
    "for a very stiff eos ( l ) the @xmath3-mode frequency is around 6 khz while for the softest eos in our set ( g ) the typical frequency is around 14 khz .",
    "the @xmath3-mode damping time is comparable to that of an oscillating black hole with the same mass , i.e. it is typically less than a tenth of a millisecond .",
    "suppose that one tries to detect the gravitational waves associated with the stellar pulsation modes that are excited when ( say ) a neutron star forms after a supernova explosion .",
    "since all modes are relatively short lived , the detection situation is similar to that for a perturbed rotating black hole @xcite . for each individual mode",
    "the signal is expected to have the following form : @xmath31 & for $ t\\geq t$. \\cr } \\label{template}\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 is the initial amplitude of the signal , @xmath33 is its arrival time , and @xmath1 and @xmath34 are the frequency and damping time of the oscillation , respectively . since the violent formation of a neutron star is a very complicated event , the above form of the waves becomes realistic only at the late stages when the remnant is settling down and its pulsations can be accurately described as a superposition of the various modes , either fluid or spacetime ones , that have been excited . at earlier times ( @xmath35 )",
    "the waves are expected to have a random character that is completely uncorrelated with the intrinsic noise of an earth - bound detector .",
    "this partly justifies our simplification of setting the waveform equal to zero for @xmath35 .",
    "the energy flux @xmath36 carried by any weak gravitational wave @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the speed of light and @xmath40 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "thus , when gravitational waves emitted from a pulsating neutron star hit such a detector on earth , their initial amplitude will be @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy released through the mode and @xmath0 is the distance between detector and source . in order to dig out this kind of signal from the noisy output of a detector",
    "one could use templates of the same form as the expected signal ( so called matched filtering ) . following the analysis of echeverria @xcite",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is found to be @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the quality factor of the oscillation , and @xmath45 the spectral density of the detector ( assumed to be constant over the bandwidth of the signal ) .",
    "two separate questions must be addressed in any discussion of gravitational - wave detection .",
    "the first one concerns identifying a weak signal in a noisy detector , thus establishing the presence of a gravitational wave in the data .",
    "the second question regards extracting the detailed parameters of the signal , e.g. , the frequency and e - folding time of a pulsation mode . to address either of these issues we need an estimate of the spectral noise density @xmath45 of the detector .",
    "the pulsation modes of a ( non - rotating ) neutron star that may be detectable through the associated gravitational waves all have rather high frequencies ; typically of the order of several khz . to illustrate this",
    "we show the mode - frequencies for all models considered in @xcite as a function of the stellar mass in figure  [ fig1 ] . from this figure",
    "we immediately see that a detector must be sensitive to frequencies of the order of 8 - 12 khz and above to observe most @xmath3-modes .",
    "of course , it is also clear that some equations of state yield @xmath3-modes with lower frequencies . for example",
    ", for massive neutron stars with @xmath46 ( stiff eos ) , which may be needed to account for data for low - mass x - ray binaries , the @xmath3-mode frequency could be as low as 6  khz ( see also recent results for the axial @xmath3-modes @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-modes lie mainly in the range 4 - 8 khz , while all @xmath1-modes have frequencies lower than 4 khz .",
    "this means that the mode - signals we consider lie in the regime where an interferometric detector is severely limited by the photon shot noise .",
    "for this reason a detection strategy based on resonant detectors ( bars , spheres or even networks of small resonant detectors @xcite ) or laser interferometers operating in dual recycling mode , in order to overcome the overwhelming photon shot noise at high frequencies @xcite , seems the most promising . in fact , the range of mode - frequencies in figure  [ fig1 ] provides strong motivation for detailed studies into the prospects for construction of dedicated ultrahigh frequency detectors .    in the following",
    "we will compare three different detectors : the initial and advanced ligo interferometers , for which @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  hz for the initial configuration , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53  hz for the advanced configuration @xcite .",
    "we also consider an `` ideal '' detector that is tuned to the frequency of the mode and has sensitivity of the order of @xmath54 hz@xmath55 .",
    "this is the sensitivity goal of the new generation of detectors under construction , see figure   [ fig2 ] . as an example of a suitably advanced instrument we will take the so called euro detector , for which the noise - level curves have been estimated by sathyaprakash and schutz ( private communication ) .",
    "it should be noted that the advanced ligo estimates are roughly valid also for spherical detectors such as tiga , cf .",
    "harry , stevenson and paik @xcite .",
    "the detectability of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-modes for different detectors can be assessed from ( [ snr ] ) . the main problem in doing",
    "this is the lack of realistic simulations providing information about the level of excitation of various modes in an astrophysical situation .",
    "still , given the frequency and damping rate of a specific mode we can ask what amount of energy must be channeled through the mode in order for it to be detectable by a given detector .",
    "we immediately find that detection of pulsating neutron stars from outside our own galaxy is very unlikely .",
    "let us consider a `` typical '' stellar model for which the @xmath1-mode has parameters @xmath56  khz and @xmath57  s , this corresponds to a @xmath58 neutron star according to the bethe - johnson equation of state @xcite .",
    "for this example we find that the @xmath1-mode in the virgo cluster ( at 15 mpc ) must carry an energy equivalent to more than @xmath59 to lead to a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 in our ideal detector .",
    "given that the total energy estimated to be radiated as gravitational waves in a supernova is at the level of @xmath60 , we can not realistically expect to observe mode - signals from far beyond our own galaxy .",
    "this means that the number of detectable events may be rather low .",
    "certainly , one would not expect to see a supernova in our galaxy more often than once every thirty years or so .",
    "still , there are a large number of neutron stars in our galaxy , all of which may be be involved in dramatic events ( see the introduction for some possible scenarios ) that lead to the excitation of pulsation modes .",
    "the energies required to make each mode detectable ( with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 ) from a source at the center of our galaxy ( at 10 kpc ) are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in the table",
    "we have used the data for the `` typical '' stellar model , for which the characteristics of the @xmath1-mode were given above , @xmath61  khz and @xmath62  s , and @xmath63  khz and @xmath64  ms .",
    "this data indicates that , even though the event that excites the modes must be violent , the energy required to make each mode detectable is not at all unrealistic .",
    "in fact , the energy levels required for both the @xmath1- and @xmath2-modes are such that detection of violent events in the life of a neutron star should be possible , given the advanced ligo detectors ( or alternatively spheres with the sensitivity proposed for tiga ) .",
    "on the other hand , detection of @xmath3-modes with the broad band configuration of ligo seems unlikely .",
    "detection of these modes , which would correspond to observing a purely relativistic phenomenon , requires dedicated high frequency detectors operating in the frequency range above 6 khz .",
    "we believe that the data in table  [ tab1 ] illustrates that neutron star pulsation modes may well be detectable from within our galaxy .",
    "the first detection may come as soon as the first generation of ligo detectors come on line , but it may be more realistic to expect that we need a third generation detector ( such as euro ) to truly probe the pulsation modes of neutron stars .    * 4r +   + detector & @xmath1-mode & @xmath2-mode & @xmath3-mode +   + ligo i & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + ligo ii & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 + ideal & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 +",
    "let us now discuss the precision with which we can hope to infer the details of each pulsation mode .",
    "we can compute the relative measurement error in the frequency and the damping time of the waves by some appropriately designed detector @xcite . after introducing a convenient parameter @xmath74 , defined by @xmath75 we find that the error estimates take the following form @xmath76 and @xmath77 also , for the time of arrival of the gravitational wave signal we get from @xmath78 to illustrate these results we list in table  [ tab2 ] the relative errors associated with the parameter extraction for the `` typical '' @xmath58 stellar model we used in the previous section .",

    "this measure will then be detector dependent , so we list the relevant estimates for the three detector configurations used in table  [ tab1 ] . when the data is viewed in this way , cf .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] , we see that an accurate extraction of @xmath3-mode data will not be possible unless a large amount of energy is released through these modes .",

    "therefore , the accuracy by which this angle can be measured is @xmath107 the @xmath108 arises from the measurement errors of the two times of arrival . if one assumes an ` l ' shaped network of 3 detectors with arm length of @xmath109  km , eqs .",
    "( [ relerrortime ] ) and ( [ deltatheta ] ) lead to an error box on the sky with angular sides of @xmath110 , at most ( for specific areas of the sky , and large signal - to - noise ratios the angular sizes could be much smaller ) .",
    "this is quite interesting since one could then correlate the detection of gravitational waves with radio , x - ray or gamma - ray observations directed towards that specific corner of the sky .",
    "so far we have discussed the modes of ( essentially ) non - rotating stars .",
    "a more optimistic scenario is based on the notion that various modes of oscillation may be unstable in a rotating star . following the serendipitous discovery of such an instability in the so - called @xmath0-modes @xcite",
    ", this area of research has attracted considerable attention .",
    "should such an instability operate in a young neutron star it may lead to the emission of copious amounts of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "such gravitational waves have been estimated to be detectable for sources in the virgo cluster ( at 15 - 20  mpc ) .",
    "if we suppose that most newly born neutron stars pass through a phase where this kind of instability is active , several such events should be observed per year once the advanced interferometers come into operation .",
    "this is a very exciting prospect , indeed .",
    "in this review article we give a brief introduction to these recent ideas and suggestions .",
    "for an exhaustive discussion we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-modes are unstable to the emission of gravitational waves via a mechanism that was first suggested by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "subsequent work by friedman and schutz @xcite showed that this instability is a generic feature of all rotating fluids , and in the case of @xmath0-modes friedman and morsink @xcite showed that that the new instability is generic for toroidal perturbations of relativistic stars .    in a simple description ,",
    "the instability works as follows : in a rapidly rotating star a backward moving mode ( as measured by a co - rotating observer ) can be dragged forward according to an inertial observer .",
    "this means that the mode radiates positive angular momentum , even though the angular momentum of the mode remains negative because the perturbed star has lower net angular momentum than the unperturbed star . as positive angular momentum",
    "is removed from the mode , its angular momentum becomes increasingly negative , implying that its amplitude increases .",
    "the mode grows due to the emission of gravitation radiation .",
    "in other words , a mode is unstable if it is prograde relative to infinity and retrograde relative to the star . for many years",
    "the investigations into the relevance of the cfs instability was focussed on the spheroidal @xmath1-mode ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is that this mode was considered the most important one as far as gravitational waves are concerned .",
    "hence , it came as some surprise that the instability associated with the toroidal @xmath0-modes is considerably stronger than the @xmath1-mode one .",
    "in fact , toroidal modes of relativistic stars attracted little attention until recently . such perturbations of non - rotating stars lead to a set of zero frequency modes in newtonian theory , complemented by gravitational - wave modes ( @xmath3-modes ) in the relativistic description @xcite .",
    "toroidal modes of a newtonian star describe stationary horizontal fluid currents , and do not induce variations in the density and pressure .",
    "when the star is set into rotation the coriolis force provides a weak restoring force that gives the toroidal modes true dynamics , and the fluid undergoes oscillations with a frequency ( measured by an inertial observer at infinity ) @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the rotational frequency of the star and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the spherical harmonic indices .",
    "this result , that identifies the @xmath0-modes , follows from a newtonian treatment of oscillations of slowly rotating stars .",
    "as one can easily deduce from their frequency the @xmath0-modes are always retrograde in the corotating frame and their phase velocity is always smaller than that of the rotation of the star ; thus they are generically unstable independently of the rotation rate of the star .",
    "that a mode is formally unstable in a perfect fluid star does not in itself mean that it will be allowed to grow and affect , for example , the star s spin evolution .",
    "in any `` realistic '' star there are dissipation mechanisms that may halt growth of an instability . in the simplest model",
    ", one must account for the effects of bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "comparison between the damping times due to viscosity and the growth time due to gravitational radiation provides a criterion for the significance of the instability . the damping / growth time associated with each mechanism",
    "can be estimated from the ratio of the energy loss to the available mode - energy ( measured in the rotating frame ) i.e. @xmath115 in our case the onset of the instability is signalled by @xmath116 in this relation , the growth time due to gravitational waves _",
    "( gw ) _ is temperature independent while both bulk _ ( bv ) _ and shear viscosity _",
    "( sv ) _ are strongly dependent on the internal temperature of the star",
    ". we can now find the critical rotation frequency at which the @xmath0-mode becomes unstable for the relevant values of the core temperature of the star .",
    "detailed calculations have shown that bulk viscosity damps any fluid motion for temperatures higher than @xmath117 k , while shear viscosity dominates for temperatures below @xmath118 k. this means that there is a `` window of opportunity '' between @xmath119 k where the @xmath0-mode instability is active and may play an astrophysical role @xcite .",
    "this instability window is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .    finally , it is worth pointing out that the gravitational radiation emitted from the @xmath0-modes comes primarily from the time - dependent _ mass - currents_. this is the gravitational analogue of magnetic multipole radiation and the @xmath0-mode instability is unique among expected astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation in radiating primarily by gravitomagnetic effects .",
    "the detectability of these gravitational waves is discussed in detail in @xcite .      before we conclude this review , it is appropriate to comment on the fact that we neglected the effects of both rotation and magnetic fields on the pulsation modes in our discussion of asteroseismology .",
    "this was ( obviously ! ) not because rotation and magnetic fields play an insignificant role . on the contrary",
    ", we expect rotation to be highly relevant in many cases ( in particular since various instabilities may set in above a critical spin rate ) , and the recent evidence for magnetars make it clear that one can not neglect the role of the magnetic field . still , as far as most pulsation modes are concerned , one would expect rotation to have a significant effect only for neutron stars with very short period , and the present study may well be reasonable for stars with periods longer than , say , 20 ms .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that neutron stars are typically born slowly rotating @xcite .",
    "if that is the typical case , then our results could be relevant also for most newly born neutron stars .",
    "a more pragmatic reason for not including rotation in the present study is that detailed data for modes of rotating neutron stars is not yet available .",
    "once such data has been computed the present study can be extended to incorporate rotational effects .",
    "there are currently efforts by various groups around the world to estimate the effects of rotation on @xmath1- , @xmath2- and @xmath3-modes ( and also calculate the @xmath0-modes ) in the framework of general relativity .",
    "there are already preliminary results for slowly - rotating stars @xcite but a complete study of both slowly and fast rotating stars is outstanding .",
    "one of the main rotational effects is the splitting of the various frequencies , i.e. the frequency is no longer degenerate with respect to the harmonic index @xmath114 .",
    "for example , the quadrupole @xmath1-mode oscillations ( @xmath120 ) will emit gravitational waves with all five possible values of @xmath114 ( -2,-1,0,1,2 ) .",
    "this splitting of the spectrum will create significant problems in using the empirical relations such as ( [ rfw ] ) .",
    "one has to derive a similar formula with an additional term of the form @xmath121 in order to include in an appropriate way the rotational corrections . in this case",
    "the prior knowledge of the rotation rate of the star may be needed .",
    "potentially , this information can be deduced from gravitational waves due to the @xmath0-mode instability . in this case",
    "the frequency is directly proportional to the rotation rate of the star , cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq_rmode ] ) , and the @xmath0-mode instability signal is expected to be much stronger than those of the other modes .",
    "hence , one can immediately infer the rotation of the star . the rotation rate will obviously change due to the @xmath0-mode , but for time intervals of the order of 1 - 2 secs ( the typical damping time of other modes ) it can be considered as constant .",
    "the information about the rotation rate can then be combined with empirical formulas that can be derived for the modes of rotating stars in order to extract all of the parameters of the star .",
    "strong magnetic fields can also affect the mode frequencies of the neutron stars .",
    "preliminary results for newtonian stars have shown that typical magnetic fields of the order of @xmath122 gauss , do not produce significant shifts in the mode frequencies .",
    "one must to consider extremely strong magnetic fields , like in magnetars ( @xmath123  g ) in order to get a significant frequency shift .",
    "in fact , this highlights an interesting issue for the magnetars : if one can detect gravitational waves from the starquakes induced by their strong magnetic fields , a possible shift in the spectrum may provide a measure of the magnetic field strength .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that a detection mode pulsation modes from old , cold neutron stars could also provide unique insights into the superfluid nature of neutron star cores .",
    "it is generally believed that once a neutron star cools below a few times @xmath124  k ( a few months after its birth ) the bulk of its core will become superfluid . thus , the more than 1000 observed pulsars provide useful laboratories for studying large scale superfluidity . in the simplest description , a superfluid neutron star core can be discussed in terms of two distinct fluids .",
    "one of these fluids represents the superfluid neutrons and the other fluid represents all charged components ( which are expected to be coupled on a relatively short timescale ) .",
    "the fact that these two fluids  the `` neutrons '' and the `` protons ''  can flow more or less independently provides one of the main distinguishing dynamical features of a superfluid neutron star .",
    "in particular , one can show that two sets of pulsation modes are interlaced in the spectrum of a superfluid neutron star core @xcite .",
    "one set of modes are the familiar @xmath2-modes , for which the two fluids tend to move together .",
    "the other set of modes are distinguished by the fact that the protons and neutrons are largely `` countermoving '' .",
    "this class of modes is unique to the two - fluid system .",
    "of particular interest for our current discussion is the fact that the `` superfluid mode '' frequencies are ( locally ) approximated by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is ( roughly ) the sound speed in the proton fluid , @xmath0 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath127 is the index of the relevant spherical harmonic @xmath128 used to describe the angular dependency of the mode . from this relation",
    "it is clear that an observation of these modes would provide potentially unique information regarding the nature of large scale superfluidity , and could put useful constraints on crucial parameters such as the ratio between the `` bare '' and `` effective '' proton masses @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( estimates to lie in the range @xmath131 ) .",
    "we think this is a very exciting prospect that should motivate future efforts in this field .",
