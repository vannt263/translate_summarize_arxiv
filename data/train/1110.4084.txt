    "in the last decade , time domain decomposition has been exploited to accelerate the simulation of systems ruled by time dependent partial differential equations  @xcite . among others , the parareal algorithm  @xcite or multi - shooting schemes  @xcite have shown excellent results . in the framework of optimal control , this approach has been used to control parabolic systems  @xcite ,  @xcite . in this paper , we introduce a new approach to tackle such problems . the strategy we follow is based on the concept of target trajectory that has been introduced in the case of hyperbolic systems in  @xcite . because of the irreversibility of parabolic equations , a new definition of this trajectory is considered .",
