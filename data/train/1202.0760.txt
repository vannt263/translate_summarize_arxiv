    "exotic hadrons which include multiquark configurations provide us with important information in hadron physics .",
    "there is a key to understand one of the most important problems in hadron physics ; what are the constituent particles of hadrons , and what are the interactions among the constituent particles at relevant low energies .",
    "those questions are related to the fundamental questions of the qcd , such as to color confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and so on . nowadays",
    "the exotic hadrons are studied , not only in light flavor sectors , but also in heavy flavor sectors with charm and bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observations of heavy exotic hadrons , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 in charm sector , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 in bottom sector have motivated intensive discussions about possible new dynamics in the heavy hadrons . many of those hadrons have unusual mass , decay width and branching ratios , which may not be explained as normal hadrons , such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . as candidates of flavor exotics for future experiments ,",
    "a new hadron state @xmath18 whose quark content is @xmath19 has been discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is a system containing two heavy quarks and it is genuinely a flavor exotic which can not be assigned by a normal hadron . in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss the energy spectrum of the possible bound and/or resonant states of @xmath18 .    in phenomenological studies",
    ", there exist two approaches to @xmath18 state . in one approach ,",
    "@xmath18 is considered as a tetraquark state , in which the effective degrees of freedom are constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "it is shown that @xmath18 may be a stable object due to the strong attraction in @xmath20 which may form a stable scalar diquark @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath18 may be a deeply bound state , which does not decay through the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "if the diquark developed , the study of @xmath18 is also useful to understand the color superconductivity in high density quark matter @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark states such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 states with @xmath24 as well as @xmath25 with @xmath26 have been discussed also as stable objects @xcite .",
    "another approach is the hadronic molecule picture .",
    "when four quarks ( @xmath19 ) are present , they may form hadronic clusters ( @xmath27 ) which may alternatively become relevant degrees of freedom instead of diquarks @xcite .",
    "the hadronic molecule picture is applied to the energy region close to the thresholds . in the @xmath28 system",
    ", two mesons composed by @xmath27 , the pseudoscalar meson @xmath29 and the vector meson @xmath30 , can become effective degrees of freedom as constituents . in the heavy quark limit , the pseudoscalar meson @xmath31 and",
    "the vector meson @xmath32 become degenerate in mass , and hence both of them should be considered .",
    "hereafter we introduce the notation @xmath33 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , we will show that the mass degeneracy of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 activates the one - pion exchange potential between two @xmath33 s , and the bound and/or resonant @xmath34 states are formed .",
    "the tetraquark picture and the hadronic molecule picture are quite different .",
    "the tetraquark picture is applied to the deeply bound state . to apply this picture to the shallow bound states or resonant states , slightly below or above thresholds",
    "respectively , is not appropriate , because the continuous @xmath33 states above thresholds are not taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronic molecule picture can be applied to the shallow and resonant states , while it can not be applied to the deeply bound states .    though there have been several studies for bound states of @xmath34 in the hadronic molecule picture ,",
    "resonant states of @xmath34 have not been studied yet .",
    "moreover , the quantum numbers @xmath35 which have been discussed are limited only @xmath36 . to be more problematic ,",
    "several channels in coupled channel problem have been neglected .",
    "the last point is very important in the heavy quark systems . in the heavy quark limit",
    ", we need to consider the mass degeneracy of @xmath31 and @xmath32 which provides more number of channels than discussed in the literature . in the present work , we discuss both bound and resonant states of @xmath34 systematically for various quantum numbers @xmath35 up to @xmath37 by considering the fully coupled channel problem .",
    "the systematic analysis of the energy spectrum for various quantum numbers is important to investigate the dynamics governing the systems .",
    "indeed , it will be shown that there are several new shallow bound and/or resonant states , which were not found in other studies , thanks to the strong attraction induced from the channel couplings even for larger @xmath38 or angular momentum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the interaction between two @xmath33 mesons with respecting the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry .",
    "we introduce the two types of potentials , the @xmath39 exchange potential and @xmath40 exchange potential . in section 3 ,",
    "we classify all the @xmath34 systems up to @xmath41 , and search the bound and/or resonant states by applying the potentials and solving the schrdinger equations numerically . in section 4",
    ", we compare our results from the hadronic molecule picture with the previous results from the tetraquark picture .",
    "we summarize our discussions in the final section .",
    "the dynamics of the hadronic molecule of @xmath34 respects two important symmetries ; the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry induces the mass degeneracy of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the heavy quark limit .",
    "because of this , we have to consider the channels of degenerate pairs , such as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , leading to the mixing of them ; @xmath43-@xmath44 , @xmath45-@xmath45 , @xmath42-@xmath45 , @xmath43-@xmath45 .    as for the meson - exchange interaction between two @xmath33 s , the one pion exchange potential ( opep ) exists at long distances .",

    "we note that there is no @xmath48 vertex because of the parity conservation .",
    "we should keep in mind in the following discussions that the existence of both @xmath46 and @xmath47 vertices thanks to the heavy quark symmetry provide the channel mixings in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 at long distance . at short distances , heavier mesons exchange potential , which provide similar channel mixings ,",

    "we find several bound and/or resonant states in @xmath79 , while there is no bound state in @xmath80 .",
    "in general , the attractive force of pion exchange in @xmath80 is three times weaker than in @xmath79 due to the isospin factor . as a numerical result , @xmath122 bound states in @xmath80 are not obtained but only resonant states are .",
    "let us look at our results one by one for each quantum number in detail . in the following text ,",
    "most of the numerical values are those for the case of the @xmath123 potential , because the results from the @xmath123 potential are generally not so different from those from the @xmath39 potential , except for the @xmath124 state .",

    "* the pion exchange potential is repulsive for diagonal components as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi_pot_1 + - ] ) .",
    "however this state has four components and the mixing of the @xmath109- and @xmath128-waves causes the strong tensor attraction from the off - diagonal components of the potential .",
    "consequently , there is a deeply bound state of mostly @xmath125 with binding energy 62.3 mev measured from the @xmath125 threshold .",
    "* there are twin shape resonances of @xmath2 with the resonance energy 17.8 mev and the decay width 41.6 mev for the first resonance , and the resonance energy 152.8 mev and the decay width 10.6 mev for the second .",
    "the resonance energies are measured from the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "those resonances are formed by the centrifugal barrier in the @xmath103-wave . *",
    "this state contains only @xmath128-wave components of @xmath125 and @xmath129 .",
    "the potential is weakly attractive .",
    "nevertheless , due to the centrifugal barrier in the @xmath128-wave , there is a shape resonance of @xmath125 scattering at the energy 33.7 mev from the @xmath125 threshold , but the decay width 196.3 mev is very wide .",
    "* when the opep is employed , there are twin resonant states with the resonance energy 0.1 mev and the decay width 0.02 mev for the first resonance , and the resonance energy 118.0 mev and the decay width 23.4 mev for the second from the @xmath125 threshold .",
    "when the effects of @xmath59 and @xmath60 meson exchange are included , the first resonance becomes a weakly bound state with the binding energy 4.3 mev , because the @xmath59 meson exchange enhances the central force attraction of the pion exchange .",
    "the @xmath60 meson exchange plays a minor role due to the isospin factor , although this contribution suppresses the attractive central force .",
    "the second resonant state with the resonance energy 112.1 mev and the decay width 26.6 mev is not affected very much . from the analysis of wave function components of the two bound states",

    "* this is the only @xmath80 state in @xmath130 .",
    "the interaction in @xmath80 are either repulsive or only weakly attractive as already discussed . nevertheless , due to the @xmath103-wave centrifugal barrier",
    ", we find twin shape resonances ; the resonance energy 2.3 mev and the decay width 37.4 mev for the first resonance , and the resonance energy 144.2 mev and the decay width 34.4 mev for the second , from the @xmath125 threshold .",
    "here several comments are in order .",
    "first , we have obtained several bound and/or resonant state even for @xmath41 . here",
    "the long range force by the opep becomes effective for the extended objects with large angular momenta .",
    "it is also interesting to have  twin states \" for several quantum numbers , @xmath131 , @xmath124 and @xmath132 .",
    "we have to note that the channel couplings by @xmath133 and @xmath134 are important to produce the obtained energy spectrum . indeed , if we cut the channel coupling , we confirm that many of the states disappear .",
    "thus , we consider that the pattern of the energy spectrum is reflected by the dynamics of the fully coupled channels .",
    "second , the present formalism of the hadronic molecule picture can not be applied to compact objects .",
    "when the two @xmath33 mesons overlap spatially , we need to consider the internal structure of @xmath33 , which is not included in the present hadronic picture .",
    "therefore we shall adopt 1 fm or larger for the size of the bound state to be interpreted as a molecular state .",
    "the size of 1 fm is twice of typical radius of @xmath135 fm .",
    "for instance , the @xmath136 bound state with the binding energy @xmath137 mev is identified with a molecular state because it has the size @xmath138 fm , while the @xmath139 bound state with @xmath140 mev is not because its size is @xmath141 fm .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this criterion is not definitive but gives only qualitative guide .",
    "next we discuss the @xmath142 states .",
    "we use the same coupling constants , and change only the masses of heavy mesons with small difference of the cutoff parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl : result_table_bb ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : resultbb0 ] and [ fig : resultbb1 ] . at first glance , we find that the @xmath142 states have many bound and resonant states in comparison with the @xmath122 states .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the kinetic term is suppressed in the hamiltonian because the reduced mass becomes larger in the bottom sector .",
    "second , the effect of channel - couplings becomes more important , because a pseudoscalar meson @xmath143 and a vector meson @xmath144 become more degenerate thanks to the heavy quark symmetry ; similar discussion has been done in refs .",
    "we note that , as a consequence of the strong attraction , several new states appear in the @xmath142 states in isospin triplet ; @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the corresponding states are not obtained in the @xmath122 states .",
    "as noted in the charm sector , the deeply bound states will not be within the scope of the hadronic molecule picture .",
    "in the bottom sector , due to more attraction , more bound states are generated .",
    "for example , we have three states ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath149 ) in the @xmath150 state .",
    "however , the @xmath104 , @xmath105 states are too compact ( 0.5 fm and 0.9 fm , respectively ) to be considered as hadronic molecules .",
    "the @xmath151 state is an extended object ( 2.5 fm ) , and hence can be considered as the hadronic molecule .",
    "similarly , it would not be conclusive yet to consider hadronic molecules for the following states with radii less than 1 fm ; the @xmath104 state in @xmath152 , the @xmath104 , 1 states in @xmath131 , the @xmath104 state in @xmath153 , the @xmath104 , 1 states in @xmath124 and the @xmath104 state in @xmath154 .",

    ", the predicted binding energy can be around 70 mev from the @xmath125 threshold . for @xmath148",
    ", the predicted binding energy can be around 27 mev .",
    "the mass of the @xmath152 states in the tetraquark picture is accidentally close to our value 62 mev in the hadronic molecule picture .",
    "however , this comparison should be considered more carefully . because the size of the @xmath152 state is 0.8 fm from table  [ tbl : result_table_dd ] , the @xmath133 and @xmath134 mesons composing the @xmath152 state",
    "would be overlapped spatially if the size of each @xmath133 and @xmath134 meson is a scale of about 1 fm .",
    "in such a compact object , the quark degrees of freedom may become active to contribute to the dynamics like the tetraquark picture .",
    "however , such an effect is out of the scope of the present hadronic molecule picture .",
    "the @xmath148 state can not be found in our present study .    in any cases , the feature in the energy spectrum in the @xmath130 molecule picture is that there are many shallow bound states and resonances in @xmath131 , @xmath153 , @xmath124 and @xmath132 , which are not found in the tetraquark picture .",
    "thus , we observe that the energy spectrum of the hadronic molecule picture by @xmath34 is qualitatively different from that of the tetraquark picture .",
    "we have discussed exotic mesons with double charm and bottom flavor whose quark content @xmath160 is genuinely exotic .",
    "we have taken the hadronic picture , and considered molecular states of two heavy mesons @xmath91 s ( a pseudoscalar meson @xmath161 , @xmath143 , and a vector meson @xmath162 , @xmath163 ) .",
    "with respecting the heavy quark and chiral symmetries , we have constructed the @xmath39 exchange potential and the @xmath123 exchange potential between the two heavy mesons . to investigate the bound and/or resonant states , we have numerically solved the coupled channel schrdinger equations for the @xmath34 states with @xmath8 for @xmath164 .    as results ,",
    "we have found many bound and/or resonant states in both charm and bottom sectors . the @xmath122 bound and resonant states have moderate energies and decay widths around the thresholds in several channels with quantum numbers ; @xmath150 , @xmath152 , @xmath131 , @xmath153 , @xmath124 and @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath142 states have more bound and resonant states with various quantum numbers .",
    "several new states appear in the @xmath142 states in isotriplet states , such as @xmath154 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which can not be found in the charm sector .",
    "by contrast to the @xmath122 states , some @xmath142 states are very compact objects with a large binding energy much below the thresholds . perhaps , these states can not survive as hadronic molecules and more consideration of quark dynamics such as tetraquarks is required .    the energy spectrum for quantum numbers",
    "@xmath35 will help us to study the structure of the exotic states with @xmath160 . in the present hadronic molecule picture",
    ", many shallow bound states and resonant states appear around the thresholds in several quantum numbers .",
    "indeed , they were not found in the tetraquark picture .",
    "it is interesting to note that , around the thresholds for @xmath131 , @xmath153 , @xmath124 and @xmath132 , the shape of energy spectrum in those states in the charm sector seems to that in he bottom sector .",
    "it may indicate a universal behavior of the energy spectrum around the thresholds .",
    "experimental studies of those exotic hadrons should be performed in the coming future .",
    "the double charm production in accelerator facilities will help us to search them @xcite .",
    "recently it has been discussed that the quark - gluon plasma in the relativistic heavy ion collisions could produce much abundance of exotic hadrons including the exotic mesons with double charm @xcite .",
    "those experimental studies will shed a light on the nature of the exotic mesons with double charm and bottom flavor , and provide important hints to the fundamental questions of the strong interaction in hadron physics .",
