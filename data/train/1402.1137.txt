    "due to its spreading nature , security in wireless communications has become an important scrutiny for a long time , and it has been analyzed from several research perspectives including information theory @xcite . in the earliest information - theoretic study conducted by shannon @xcite , the wiretap channel in which a transmitter communicates with a legitimate receiver with the presence of an eavesdropper was characterized @xcite . considering the wiretap channel , wyner @xcite showed that secure transmission to a legitimate destination can be achieved , and he defined secrecy capacity as the highest reliable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the eavesdropper completely puzzled about the transmitted signal . following these studies ,",
    "there have been recently a large number of investigations addressing information - theoretic security under various conditions in different channel models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for instance , secure communications and secrecy capacity in fading channels have been studied in @xcite and @xcite .    meanwhile , on the grounds of randomness and fluctuations in wireless environment , not only security but also quality - of - service ( qos ) regarding delay and buffer constraints has been considered as a vital performance metric . accordingly , effective capacity @xcite as a dual of effective bandwidth @xcite has attracted a remarkable focus as it has identified the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while meeting qos requirements .",
    "subsequently , the authors in @xcite-@xcite meticulously researched effective capacity in several contexts .",
    "for example , it was investigated in cognitive radios under interference power limitations while regarding channel sensing results @xcite and in cognitive radio relay channels under average and peak power constraints @xcite .    during the time",
    "the ever - increasing demand for higher data rates with stringent qos requirements is inevitably leading to highly intense spectrum occupancy , cognitive radio has emerged as a solution to ameliorate spectrum inefficiency , and to provide better qos . since then , several complex transmission scenarios have been proposed and analyzed , i.e. , cooperative strategies for cognitive radio networks attracted significant attention @xcite . with the growing multiplicity ,",
    "security challenges have become more sophisticated and multi - directional in different aspects @xcite .",
    "specifically , as a substance of information - theoretic security in cognitive radios , the outage probability of secrecy capacity of a primary user ( pu ) from a theoretical point of view has been studied @xcite , and the relationship between multiple - input multiple - output channel secrecy rate and the cognitive radios under interference power constraints has been examined @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "different than the aforementioned studies , we investigate the information - theoretic security of secondary users ( sus ) in cognitive radio wiretap channels where sus detect the activities of pus imperfectly , and then perform data transmission under qos and interference power constraints .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ channel_model_and_power_constraints ]",
    ", we describe the cognitive radio wiretap channel model , and define the interference power constraints considering channel sensing errors . in section [ secrecy_rates_section ]",
    ", we provide the instantaneous secrecy capacities that depend on channel sensing results and channel fading parameters .",
    "furthermore , we identify channel states , and establish the effective secure capacity in section [ effective_secure_rate_section ] , and obtain the optimal transmission power policies that maximize this capacity in section [ optimal_transmission_power_section ] . finally , we present the numerical results in section [ numerical_results_section ] , and we summarize our achievements in section [ conclusion_section ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ res : res_1 ] , we consider a setting in which a single secondary transmitter , denoted by st , performs communications with two secondary receivers ( srs ) in the presence of possibly multiple pus .",
    "we assume that st sends confidential messages to one of the srs , which is denoted by @xmath0 . in this perspective",
    ", the other sr , which is denoted by @xmath1 , can be considered as an eavesdropper . nevertheless , it is not necessarily a malicious one in our case as it abides by the protocols and regulations",
    ". we can consider this scenario as a part of a larger scenario in which st sends both confidential and common messages to both srs at different time intervals in the long - run .",
    "we further assume that the pus are not aware of the coding strategies of the sus .        in the above model",
    ", the generated data sequences are initially stored in the data buffer , and then transmitted by st in frames of @xmath2 seconds over the wireless channel . during the data transmission , the channel input - output relations at the @xmath3 time instant are @xmath4 if the pus are absent .",
    "above , @xmath5 denotes the complex - valued channel input , and @xmath6 is the complex - valued channel output at @xmath0 , while @xmath7 is the complex - valued channel output at @xmath1 . in ( [ channel_state_1_busy ] ) and ( [ channel_state_1_idle ] ) ,",
    "@xmath8 represents the fading coefficient between st and @xmath0 , and in ( [ channel_state_2_busy ] ) and ( [ channel_state_2_idle ] ) , @xmath9 represents the fading coefficient between st and @xmath1 .",
    "they both are assumed to be zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian distributed random variables with variances @xmath10 and @xmath11 . note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the magnitude squares of instantaneous fading coefficients . in the above equations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are sequences of additive thermal random noise samples at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that are also zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian distributed with variances @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . in ( [ channel_state_1_busy ] ) and ( [ channel_state_2_busy ] ) , @xmath18 arriving at @xmath19 and @xmath20 arriving at @xmath1 denote the active pus faded signals .",
    "we show the average power levels of @xmath18 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we further consider a block - fading channel model , and assume that the fading coefficients stay constant for a frame duration of @xmath2 seconds , and change independently from one frame to another . besides",
    ", we also assume that the activities of the pus stay the same in each frame , and that they have likewise an independent activity state change from one frame to another .",
    "we remark that the pus exist with probability @xmath24 in each frame .",
    "meanwhile , st , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 experience the interference caused by the pus contemporaneously when the pus are active , but not at the same average power level . we finally express that the available bandwidth is @xmath25 , and so is the symbol rate assumed to be @xmath25 complex symbols per second .",
    "initially , the sus perform channel sensing to verify the activities of the pus , and then , depending on the channel sensing results , they choose their transmission power policies . in more detail , if the channel is sensed to be busy , st sends data with an instantaneous power policy of @xmath26 , whereas , if the channel is sensed as idle , it sends with an instantaneous power policy of @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , we consider a practical scenario in which channel sensing errors such as miss - detections and false alarms possibly occur . hence",
    ", we denote the correct - detection probability by @xmath28 which is the probability of declaring the channel as busy while the channel is actually busy , and the false alarm probability by @xmath29 which is the probability of declaring the channel as busy while the channel is actually idle .",
    "here , the busy state indicates that the pus are active , and the idle state indicates that there is not any active pu in the transmission environment .",
    "we further notice that as a result of channel sensing errors , st deploys policies @xmath26 and @xmath27 with probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath30 , respectively , given that the pus are actually active . therefore , the power interference constraint is imposed on not only @xmath26 but also @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the combined interference power constraint is given as @xmath31 where the expectation @xmath32 is taken with respect to the fading coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the average power interference constraint is considered as the average power interference constraint normalized over average fading power and path loss of the channel between st and the prs . ] .",
    "now , let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the transmission power policies normalized over @xmath35 .",
    "hence , we can rewrite ( [ interference_power_constraint ] ) as follows : @xmath38 since , the average transmission power of st is limited by @xmath35 , we define the following signal - to - noise ratio at @xmath0 as @xmath39 .",
    "initially , we consider four different transmission scenarios regarding the channel sensing decision and its correctness :    1 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as busy ( correct detection ) , 2 .",
    "channel is busy , detected as idle ( miss - detection ) , 3 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as busy ( false alarm ) , 4 .",
    "channel is idle , detected as idle ( correct detection ) .",
    "we can easily see that st will send data with the power policy @xmath40 in scenarios 1 and 3 , and @xmath41 in scenarios 2 and 4 .",
    "hence , assuming the interference caused by the pus , @xmath42 and @xmath20 , as additional gaussian noise , the instantaneous secure channel capacities in the above four scenarios are expressed as @xmath43^+\\nonumber\\\\&\\text { bits / s for } k=\\{1,2,3,4\\ } , \\label{capacity_ifadeleri}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 above , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48^+=\\max(0,a)$ ] .",
    "we observe that the first expression in the right - hand - side of the above equation , @xmath49 , is in fact the instantaneous channel capacity between st and @xmath0 , and the second expression , @xmath50 , is the instantaneous channel capacity between st and @xmath1 .",
    "it is clearly seen that when @xmath50 is greater than or equal to @xmath49 , the instantaneous secure channel capacity will be zero .",
    "therefore , when the channel of @xmath1 is stronger than the channel of @xmath0 , st is not required to transmit any secret data to @xmath19 ( i.e. , when @xmath51 , @xmath52 in scenario 1 and @xmath53 in scenario 2 , and when @xmath54 , @xmath52 in scenario 3 and @xmath53 in scenario 4 . ) .",
    "now , let @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the secure transmission rates , and let @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the confusion rates , when the channel is sensed as busy and idle , respectively .",
    "hence , when the channel of @xmath19 is stronger than the channel of @xmath59 , we assume that with a secure transmission rate lower than or equal to the instantaneous secure channel capacity ( i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in scenarios 1 and 3 , respectively , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 in scenarios 2 and 4 , respectively ) , and a confusion rate greater than or equal to the instantaneous channel capacity between st and @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 in scenarios 1 and 3 , respectively , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 in scenarios 2 and 4 , respectively ) , st will be able to reliably transmit data to @xmath0 without revealing any information to @xmath1 as long as the sum of secure transmission and confusion rates is smaller than the channel capacity between st and @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in scenarios 1 and 3 , respectively , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 in scenarios 2 and 4 , respectively ) . in this case , @xmath19 will be able to decode both the confusion and secure data , but @xmath59 will be blinded by the confusion data and unable to decode the secure data .",
    "since the sus rely on the channel sensing results , and st knows both channel fading coefficients , and the srs know their corresponding channel fading coefficients , one of the best transmission strategies could be that when the pus are detected as active , the instantaneous secure transmission rate in one frame is @xmath72^+\\text { bits / s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that when the pus are detected as idle , it is @xmath73^+\\text { bits / s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we have the instantaneous secure transmission rates @xmath74 equal to @xmath75 in scenarios 1 and 3 , and @xmath76 equal to @xmath77 in scenarios 2 and 4 .",
    "it is clearly seen that in scenarios 1 and 4 , since the sum of secure transmission rate and confusion rate is equal to the instantaneous channel capacity between st and @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , and since the instantaneous confusion rate is equal to the instantaneous channel capacity between st and @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , there will be no transmission and security outages , and a reliable and secure communication will be provided . as a result ,",
    "the effective secure transmission rate in one frame is @xmath82 in scenario 1 , and @xmath83 in scenario 4 . on the other hand , in scenarios 2 and 3",
    ", we do have different situations .",
    "for instance , @xmath84 in scenario 2 .",
    "therefore , no reliable communication will be performed because @xmath0 will not be able to decode the confusion and transmitted data , and as a result the effective secure transmission rate is zero .",
    "it is , thence , assumed that a simple automatic repeat request mechanism is invoked in order to ensure that erroneous data is retransmitted .",
    "in addition , we observe that @xmath85 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath1 will not be able to decode the transmitted data intended for @xmath0 too .",
    "therefore , there is no security outage in this scenario as well .",
    "however , we see that @xmath86 in scenario 3 , which means that @xmath0 will be able to decode the confusion and transmitted data . at the same time",
    ", we also mark that @xmath87 .",
    "particularly , the confusion created by st has a smaller rate than the required value , @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , it is also likely that @xmath1 can decode the transmitted data especially when @xmath89 ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) , which will jeopardize the secrecy of the transmitted data .",
    "therefore , in order to guarantee the information - theoretic security , we propose the following transmission rate policy when pus are detected as active : @xmath91^+\\text { bits / s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , when the channel is detected as busy while @xmath92 , the security will always be provided in scenario 1 , because @xmath1 will not be able to decode the transmitted data since @xmath93 .",
    "meanwhile , the security in scenario 3 will also be provided , because @xmath94 .",
    "note that @xmath0 will securely decode its data since @xmath95 and @xmath96 in scenarios 1 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in this section , having characterized the instantaneous secure transmission rates , we investigate the secure throughput for the aforementioned fading cognitive radio wiretap channel under statistical qos constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors defined effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a desired statistical qos specified with the qos exponent @xmath97 . defining @xmath98 as the stationary queue length and @xmath97 as the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath98",
    ", we can express the following : @xmath99 therefore , we have the following approximation for larger @xmath100 : @xmath101 , which means that larger @xmath97 refers to strict buffer constraints , and smaller @xmath97 implies looser constraints .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath102 for constant arrival rates , where @xmath103 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer , and @xmath104 is a positive constant . in the above formulation ,",
    "@xmath105 where @xmath106 is the source arrival rate .",
    "therefore , effective capacity can provide us the maximum arrival rate when the system is subject to the statistical queue length or delay constraints in the forms of @xmath107 or @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the effective capacity for a given qos exponent @xmath97 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the time - accumulated service process , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 is the discrete - time , stationary and ergodic stochastic service process .",
    "we note that @xmath113 is the asymptotic log - moment generating function of @xmath114 , and is given by @xmath115        under block - fading assumption , the securely transmitted number of bits is @xmath82 or @xmath83 in the @xmath116 transmission frame , if the transmission policy @xmath40 or @xmath41 is chosen , respectively , and if the data is transmitted successfully . in the sequel ,",
    "since the transmission rate is constant during one frame , and the channel fading coefficients and the activities of the pus change independently from one frame to another , we will drop the time index @xmath117 . in the above model , when the channel is detected as busy in scenarios 1 and 3 , the service rate is @xmath118 , whereas , when the channel is detected as idle in scenario 4 , the service rate is @xmath119 in one frame . in scenario 2 ,",
    "the service rate is zero .    in figure",
    "[ res : res_4 ] , we display the state transition diagram of the cognitive radio wiretap channel . on the top - left ( scenario 1 ) and top - right ( scenario 3 ) ,",
    "we see the states in which st sends data reliably with a secure transmission rate @xmath120 in one frame , whereas on the lower - right ( scenario 4 ) , we have the state in which data is transmitted with a secure transmission rate @xmath121 . on the other hand , on the lower - left ( scenario 2 ) , due to miss - detection when the pus are active , the effective secure transmission rate is 0 .",
    "moreover , state transition probabilities are also shown in the figure .",
    "for instance , state transition from any state to state 1 is @xmath122 .",
    "similarly , state transition probabilities to states 2 , 3 , and 4 are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "this is due to the fact that the activities of the pus and the channel fading coefficients change independently from one frame to another .    following the steps in @xcite",
    ", we can express the effective secure capacity , which is the maximum constant arrival rate of secret data arriving at st , as @xmath126\\text { bits / s / hz.}\\label{effective_capacity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "after characterizing the effective secure capacity , we turn our attention to optimal transmission power policies that will maximize the expression in ( [ effective_capacity ] ) .",
    "the following result provides the optimal power allocation policies .",
    "[ optimal_power_allocation_policies ] the optimal power allocation policies , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , that maximize the effective secure capacity are given by @xmath132 respectively , where @xmath133 @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 is the power threshold value in the power adaptation policies , and it can be obtained from the average interference power constraint given in ( [ interference_power_constraint_mu ] ) through numerical techniques , the transmitter does not need to consider the above policies since there is no direct link to @xmath59 . in such a case ,",
    "security is guaranteed at any value of @xmath140 . ] .",
    "now , we can easily find out that ( [ mu_b_optimal ] ) and ( [ mu_i_optimal ] ) are monotonically decreasing convex functions of @xmath141 for @xmath142 , and @xmath143 and @xmath144 are greater than 0 .",
    "therefore , we provide the following simple algorithm to obtain optimal power policies :    initialize @xmath139 ; [ xsdsad ] @xmath145 ; initialize @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 ; @xmath149 ; [ buradan ] @xmath150 , @xmath148 ; @xmath150 , @xmath151 ; @xmath152 , @xmath153 ; @xmath152 , @xmath148 ; [ buraya ] @xmath154 ; initialize @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 ; @xmath158 ; ... follow steps [ buradan]-[buraya ] for @xmath131 ... ; declare @xmath130 and @xmath131 ; update @xmath139 and return to step [ xsdsad ] ;",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results . unless indicated otherwise , we consider the following parameter values .",
    "the channel is assumed to be busy with probability @xmath159 .",
    "the noise variances are assumed to be @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and the average power of the pus signals arriving at the srs are @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "we further assume that the fading coefficients have unit variances @xmath164 in rayleigh fading environment .",
    "channel bandwidth is @xmath165 hz , and the frame duration is @xmath166 second . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] , we demonstrate the performance of algorithm [ algo : power ] under different channel conditions and qos requirements . in the upper part of the figure , we display the probability distribution of number of iterations required for convergence for different values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 when @xmath169 db and qos exponent @xmath170 .",
    "we notice that channel sensing performance do not affect the required number of iterations .",
    "the required number of iterations is often less than 14 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the lower part of the figure , we observe that while the value of @xmath97 has an impact on the speed of the algorithm , @xmath171 does not have any effect . with decreasing @xmath97 ( less strict qos requirements ) , the number of iterations also decreases . for instance , when @xmath172 , mostly with less than 5 iterations , the algorithm converges to the solution .     to converge to the solution . ]     for different values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 . ]    in figure [ fig : fig_2 ] , we plot the effective secure capacity as a function of @xmath97 for different @xmath29 and @xmath28 values when @xmath169 db . as expected , effective secure capacity increases with decreasing @xmath97 , and better channel sensing performance enhances the transmission throughput , e.g. , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we interestingly note that the gains attained through boosting channel sensing performance tend to diminish with increasing @xmath97 . in figure [ fig : fig_3 ] , we plot the effective secure capacity as a function of @xmath171 for different channel sensing results when @xmath175 .",
    "we point out that effective secure capacity does not escalate with the looser interference power constraints after certain @xmath171(@xmath35 ) value .",
    "in contrast to results in fig . [",
    "fig : fig_2 ] , we see that channel sensing performance has a considerable effect in transmission throughput .     for different values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 when @xmath175 . ]     for different @xmath29 , @xmath168 , and @xmath171 values when @xmath172 . ]",
    "we recall that @xmath46 is the interference plus noise - to - noise ratio at @xmath19 which can be considered as an important parameter that will help us analyze the effects of hidden - terminal problem in cognitive radio wiretap channels . we know that the minimum value of @xmath176 is 1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_4 ] , we plot the effective secure capacity vs. @xmath176 . we observe that channel sensing results have a crucial role in the transmission throughput .",
