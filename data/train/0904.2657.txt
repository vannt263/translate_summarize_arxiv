    "substantial progress has been accomplished in this last decade on our theoretical understanding of the acceleration of particles at relativistic shocks , revealing in more than one place crucial differences with fermi acceleration at non - relativistic shock waves .",
    "for instance , gallant & achterberg ( 1999 ) , achterberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have emphasized the strong anisotropy of the cosmic ray population propagating upstream , which is directly related to the fact that the relativistic shock wave is always trailing right behind the accelerated particles .",
    "these particles are confined into a beam of opening angle @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the lorentz factor of the shock wave in the upstream frame ) and are overtaken by the shock wave on a timescale @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the typical larmor radius of these particles in the background magnetic field .",
    "one consequence of the above is to restrict the energy gain per up@xmath4down@xmath4up cycle , @xmath5 , to a factor of order unity .",
    "early monte carlo numerical experiments nonetheless observed efficient fermi acceleration , with a generic spectral index @xmath6 in the ultra - relativistic limit ( bednarz & ostrowski 1998 , achterberg et al .",
    "2001 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 , ellison & double 2004 ) , in agreement with semi - analytical studies ( kirk et al . 2000 ) and analytical calculations ( keshet & waxman 2005 ) .",
    "this value of the spectral index is however restricted to the assumption of isotropic turbulence both upstream and downstream of the shock ( niemiec & ostrowski 2004 ; lemoine & revenu 2006 ) , whereas the shock crossing conditions imply a mostly perpendicular magnetic field downstream , which severely limits the possibility of downstream scattering .",
    "furthermore , it was later stressed by niemiec & ostrowski ( 2006 ) and lemoine , pelletier & revenu ( 2006 ) that these early studies implicitly ignored the correlation between the upstream and downstream particle trajectories during a cycle . in particular , the former numerical study demonstrated that fermi acceleration became inefficient if the proper shock crossing conditions were applied to the background magnetic field .",
    "this result was demonstrated analytically in the latter study , concluding that fermi acceleration could only proceed if strong turbulence ( @xmath7 ) existed on a scale much smaller than the typical larmor radius .",
    "the addition of turbulence on large scales @xmath8 does not help in this respect , as the particle then experiences a roughly coherent field on the short length scales that it probes during its cycle .",
    "further studies by niemiec , ostrowski & pohl ( 2006 ) have confirmed that fermi acceleration proceeds if short scale turbulence is excited to high levels , either downstream or upstream .",
    "the detailed conditions under which fermi acceleration can proceed have been discussed analytically in pelletier , lemoine & marcowith ( 2009 ) ; they are found to agree with the numerical results of niemiec , ostrowski & pohl ( 2006 ) .",
    "amplification of magnetic fields on short spatial scales thus appears to be an essential ingredient in fermi processes at ultra - relativistic shock waves . quite interestingly",
    ", strong amplification has been inferred from the synchrotron interpretation of gamma - ray burst afterglows , downstream at the level of @xmath9 ( waxman 1997 ; see piran 2005 for a review ) , and upstream with @xmath10 ( li & waxman 2006 ) , assuming an upstream magnetic field typical of the interstellar medium .",
    "understanding the mechanism by which the magnetic field gets amplified is crucial to our understanding to relativistic fermi acceleration , since the nature of this short scale turbulence will eventually determine the nature of scattering , hence the spectral index and the acceleration timescale .",
    "concerning the amplification of the downstream magnetic field , the weibel two stream instability operating in the shock transition layer has been considered as a prime suspect ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 , medvedev & loeb 1999 , wiersma & achterberg 2004 , achterberg & wiersma 2007 , achterberg , wiersma & norman 2007 ; lyubarsky & eichler 2006 ) .",
    "several questions nevertheless remain open .",
    "for instance , hededal & nishikawa ( 2005 ) and spitkovsky ( 2005 ) have observed , by the means of numerical simulations that this instability gets quenched when the magnetization of the upstream field becomes sufficiently large . on analytical grounds , wiersma & achterberg ( 2004 ) , achterberg & wiersma ( 2007 ) , and lyubarsky & eichler ( 2006 )",
    "have argued that it saturates at a level too low to explain the gamma - ray burst afterglow .",
    "the long term evolution of the generated turbulence also remains an open question , although medvedev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) claim to see the merging of current filaments into larger filaments through dedicated numerical experiments .    regarding upstream instabilities ,",
    "the relativistic generalization of the non - resonant bell instability has been investigated by milosavljevi & nakar ( 2006 ) and reville , kirk & duffy ( 2006 ) in the case of parallel shock waves .",
    "however , ultra - relativistic shock waves are generically superluminal , with an essentially transverse magnetic field in the shock front . for this latter case , pelletier ,",
    "lemoine & marcowith ( 2009 ) have shown that the equivalent of the bell non - resonant instability excites magnetosonic compressive modes and saturates at a moderate level @xmath11 in the frame of the linear theory .    in recent years",
    ", particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations have become a key tool in the investigation of these various issues .",
    "such simulations go ( by construction ) beyond the test particle approximation and may therefore probe the wave  particle relationship , which is central to all of the above issues .",
    "of course , such benefice comes at the price of numerical limitations of the simulations , both in terms of dimensionality and of dynamic range , which in turns impact on the mass ratios accessible to the computation .",
    "nonetheless , early pic simulations have been able to simulate the interpenetration of relativistic flows and to study the development of two stream instabilities at early times , see e.g. silva et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , frederiksen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , hededal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , dieckmann ( 2005 ) , dieckmann , drury & shukla ( 2006 ) , dieckmann , shukla & drury ( 2006 ) , nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and frederiksen & dieckmann ( 2008 ) for unmagnetized colliding plasma shells , and nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , dieckmann , eliasson & shukla ( 2004a , b ) , nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hededal & nishikawa ( 2005 ) for studies of the magnetized case .",
    "the formation of the shock itself has been observed for both electron - positron and electron - proton plasmas thanks to recent simulations that were able to carry the integration on to longer timescales , see e.g. spitkovsky ( 2005 ) , kato ( 2007 ) , chang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , dieckmann , shukla & drury ( 2008 ) , spitkovsky ( 2008a , b ) , keshet et al .",
    "all of the above studies use different techniques for the numerical integration , and varying parameters ( dimensions , composition , mass ratios , density ratios of the colliding plasmas and relative lorentz factors ) in order to examine different aspects of the instabilities to various degrees of accuracy and over different timescales .",
    "several of these studies have reported hints for particle acceleration through non fermi processes ( dieckmann , eliasson & shukla 2004b ; frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ; hededal et al .",
    "2004 ; hededal & nishikawa 2005 ; nishikawa et al . 2005 ; dieckmann , shukla & drury 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "concrete evidence for fermi acceleration , i.e. particles bouncing back and forth across the shock wave has come with the recent simulations of spitkovsky ( 2008b ) , and was studied in more details for both magnetized and unmagnetized shock waves in sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) . in particular , this latter study has demonstrated the inefficiency of fermi acceleration at high upstream magnetization in the superluminal case , along with the absence of amplification of the magnetic field ( thus in full agreement with the calculations of lemoine , pelletier & revenu 2006 ) .",
    "this result is particularly interesting , because it suggests that the magnetization of the upstream plasma , in limiting the length of the precursor , may hamper the growth of small scale magnetic fields , and therefore inhibit fermi cycles .",
    "finally , the long term simulations of keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have also observed a steady development of turbulence upstream of the shock wave , suggesting that as time proceeds , particles are accelerated to higher and higher energies and may thus stream further ahead of the shock wave .",
    "we will discuss this issue as well at the end of the present work .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to undertake a systematic study of micro - instabilities in the upstream medium of a relativistic shock wave .",
    "we should emphasize that we assume the shock structure to exist and we concentrate our study on the shock transition region where the incoming upstream plasma collides with the shock reflected and shock accelerated ions that are moving towards upstream infinity .",
    "therefore , care should be taken when confronting the present results to the above numerical simulations which reproduce the collision of two neutral plasma flows in order to study the development of instabilities that eventually lead to the formation of the shock ( through the thermalization of the electron and ion populations ) .",
    "the physical set - up that we have in mind matches best that obtained in the simulations of shock formation and particle acceleration described in spitkovsky ( 2008b ) , keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) , or that simulated in dieckmann , eliasson and shukla ( 2004a , b ) and frederiksen & dieckmann ( 2008 ) , or that studied in medvedev & zakutnyaya ( 2008 ) .",
    "our approach also rests on the following observation , namely that in the ultra - relativistic limit , the accelerated ( or the reflected ) particle population essentially behaves as an _ unmagnetized cold beam of lorentz factor @xmath12_.    in the present paper , we assume the beam to be carrying a weak current and in so doing , we neglect electromagnetic current instabilities .",
    "we will nevertheless include in our summary of instabilities the relativistic generalization of the bell current instability ( bell 2004 ) , since it has been studied in detail in several recent studies ( milosavljevi & nakar 2006 ; reville , kirk & duffy 2006 ) .",
    "the instability triggered by the cosmic - ray current in the case of oblique shock waves has also been discussed in the relativistic regime in pelletier , lemoine & marcowith ( 2009 ) .",
    "note also that in the case of pair plasmas , electromagnetic current instabilities do not take place as the beam remains neutral .",
    "the layout of the present paper is as follows .",
    "we examine the instabilities triggered by this beam , considering in turn the cases of an unmagnetized upstream plasma ( section  3 ) and that of a magnetized plasma ( section  4 ) . in section  5",
    ", we discuss the intermediate limit and construct a phase diagram indicating which instability prevails as a function of shock lorentz factor and magnetization level .",
    "we then discuss the possibility of fermi acceleration in the generated turbulence and apply these results to the case of gamma - ray bursts shock waves and pulsar winds .",
    "we will recover the trend announced above , namely that a magnetized upstream medium inhibits the growth of the magnetic field hence particle acceleration . in section  2",
    ", we first discuss the general structure of a collisionless shock , in the case of a electron ",
    "proton plasma with a quasi perpendicular mean field , borrowing from analyses in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "a collisionless shock is built with the reflection of a fraction of incoming particles at some barrier , generally of electrostatic or magnetic nature .",
    "let us sketch the general picture , borrowing from model of non - relativistic collisionless electro - ion shocks ( see e.g. treumann & jaroschek 2008a , b for recent reviews ) .",
    "in an electron ",
    "proton- plasma carrying an oblique magnetic field , one expects a barrier of both electrostatic and magnetic nature to rise . because the magnetic field is frozen in most part of the plasma , its transverse component is amplified by the velocity decrease .",
    "this in itself forms a magnetic barrier which can reflect back a fraction of the incoming protons .",
    "similarly , the increase of electron density together with the approach of the electron population towards statistical equilibrium is concomittant with the rise of an electrostatic potential such that @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the local density in the front frame , and @xmath15 the upstream incoming density viewed in the front frame ) .",
    "the electron temperature is expected to grow to a value comparable to , but likely different from that of protons , which reaches @xmath16 .",
    "the electrostatic barrier thus allows the reflection of a significant part of the incoming protons since @xmath17 .",
    "although it reflects a fraction of protons , it favors the transmission of electrons that would otherwise be reflected by the magnetic barrier . the reflection of a fraction of the protons ensures the matter flux preservation against the mass density increase downstream .",
    "however because the magnetic field is almost transverse , an intense electric field @xmath18 energizes these reflected protons such that they eventually cross the barrier .",
    "interactions between the different streams of protons are then expected to generate a turbulent heating of the proton population , which takes place mostly in the so - called `` foot '' region .",
    "this foot region extends from the barrier upstream over a length scale ( in the shock front frame , as indicated by the @xmath19 subscript ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the larmor radius of the reflected protons .",
    "entropy production in the shock transition region comes from two independent anomalous ( caused by collisionless effects ) heating processes for electrons and ions .",
    "the three ion beams in the foot ( incoming , reflected in the foot and accelerated ) interact through the `` modified two stream instability '' , which seemingly constitutes the main thermalisation process of the ion population .",
    "a careful description of these anomalous heating processes certainly requires an appropriate kinetic description . for the time being , we note that the growth of the ion temperature develops on a length scale @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature of the electrons rather grows on a very short scale scale @xmath23 which defines the `` ramp '' of the shock . in non - relativistic shocks , electrons reach a temperature larger than ions ; however we do not know yet whether this is the case in relativistic shocks",
    ". these electrons also experience heating in the convection electric field .",
    "moreover , due to the strong gradient of magnetic field , an intense transverse electric current is concentrated , inducing anomalous heat transfer through the ramp .",
    "probably an anomalous diffusion of electron temperature occurs that smoothes out the temperature profile ; however it has not been identified in relativistic shocks .",
    "electron heating is described by ohm s law in the direction of the convection electric field ( in the @xmath24 direction , taken to be @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the shock front frame , @xmath28 , @xmath29 denoting the background magnetic field at infinity .",
    "the magnetic field profile can be obtained by prescribing a velocity profile going from @xmath30 to @xmath31 over a distance much larger than @xmath32 .",
    "the profile displays a ramp at scale @xmath32 followed by an overshoot before reaching the asymptotic value @xmath33 .",
    "the above result indicates that the relevant scale for @xmath32 is the relativistic resistive length : @xmath34 this is a very short scale not larger than the electron inertial length @xmath35 even when the anomalous resistivity is so strong that the effective collision frequency @xmath36 is of order @xmath37 .",
    "this scale thus represents the growth scale of three major quantities , namely , the potential , the magnetic field and the electron temperature .",
    "it is of interest to point out that this scale always remains much smaller than the foot scale . indeed , even if @xmath38 is estimated with ultra - relativistic electrons of relativistic mass @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] , it remains smaller than the foot length , since @xmath41 using the value of @xmath42 for particles with typical energy @xmath43 in the shock front .",
    "the last inequality in the above equation is a natural requirement for a strong shock .",
    "the downstream flow results from the mixing of the flow of first crossing ions ( adiabatically slowed down ) with the flow of transmitted ions after reflection .",
    "all the ingredients of a shock are then realized .    in the case of an electron - positron plasma ,",
    "when a magnetic field is considered , no electrostatic barrier rises , only the magnetic barrier appears .",
    "however , if the mean magnetic field is negligible , a barrier can rise only through the excitation of waves , as demonstrated by the pic simulations discussed above .",
    "the structure is thus described by two scales @xmath32 and @xmath44 and three small parameters : @xmath45 , the fraction of thermal energy density behind the shock converted into cosmic ray energy , @xmath46 the ratio of magnetic energy density over the incoming energy density and @xmath47 .",
    "as mentioned above , there are three particle populations in the foot : the cold incoming particles , the reflected protons , and the accelerated particle population which has undergone at least one up@xmath4down@xmath4up cycle .",
    "this latter population arrives upstream with a typical lorentz factor @xmath48 , with a typical relative spread of order unity .",
    "the second population of reflected protons also carries an energy @xmath49 , since these particles have performed a fermi - like cycle , albeit in the front rather than downstream .",
    "therefore one can treat these two populations as a single beam . from the point of view of the instabilities",
    ", one can approximate this beam as cold , with momentum distribution @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , the instabilities are governed by the beam velocity , the dispersion of which remains very small , being of order @xmath51 . in order to verify this , one writes the susceptibility of the beam , assuming as above that it is unmagnetized on the scale of the instabilities ( melrose 1986 ) : @xmath52 \\ , \\label{eq : beams}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the distribution function of the beam . since the velocity distribution of the beam is essentially delta like , one",
    "may then indeed approximate the above beam susceptibility with that of a cold beam ; the difference amounts to a redefinition of the beam plasma frequency by a factor of order unity .",
    "another crucial length scale in our study is the length scale of the precursor .",
    "as discussed above , this length scale @xmath55 in the front shock in the case of a magnetized shock wave . in the upstream frame , this can be rewritten as : @xmath56 we assume that the field is almost perpendicular in the front frame , but in the upstream comoving frame we consider its obliquity ( angle @xmath57 with respect to the shock normal ) , assuming that @xmath58 .",
    "the particular case of a parallel shock wave for which @xmath59 is discussed in section  [ sec : parshock ] ; there it will be shown that a fraction @xmath60 of the particles that return upstream may actually propagate to upstream infinity in the limit of a fully coherent upstream magnetic field , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfb ] ) remains correct for the rest of the accelerated particle population .",
    "the size of the precursor for the particles that escape away is eventually given by the level of turbulence ahead of the shock wave .",
    "in the case of an unmagnetized shock wave , the size of the precursor is determined by the length traveled by the reflected protons in the self - generated short scale turbulence . neglecting for simplicity the influence of the short scale upstream electric fields ( we will see in section  [ sec : fermi ] that this does not affect the following result ) , this length scale can be written ( milosavljevi & nakar 2006 ; pelletier , lemoine & marcowith 2009 ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the typical scale of short scale magnetic fluctuations . whether one or the other formula applies depends on several possible situations and outcomes : if the shock is magnetized and one considers the first generation of cosmic rays , one should use eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfb ] ) ; if the shock is magnetized and one assumes that a stationary state has developed with strong self - generated turbulence , one should use eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfu ] ) ; obviously , if the development of the turbulence can not take place , one should rather use eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfb ] ) ; finally , for an unmagnetized shock , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfu ] ) applies . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the turbulence growth rate for these different cases .",
    "there seems to be a consensus according to which magnetic fluctuations have to be tremendously amplified through the generation of cosmic rays upstream in order for fermi acceleration to proceed .",
    "a fraction @xmath45 of the incoming energy is converted into cosmic rays and a fraction of this cosmic rays energy is converted into electromagnetic fluctuations , which add up to a fraction @xmath63 of the incoming energy .",
    "this process is expected to develop such that the generation of cosmic rays allows the generation of electromagnetic waves that in turn , through more intense scattering , allows further cosmic ray acceleration and so on until some saturation occurs .",
    "we write the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath64 as : @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "we approximate the beam pressure with that of the cosmic rays , i.e. @xmath67 for the first generation of accelerated particles , as expressed in the shock front frame .",
    "the electromagnetic energy density is written @xmath68 in the same frame , as usual .",
    "unless otherwise noted , our discussion takes place in the upstream rest frame in what follows .",
    "when the ambient magnetic field can be neglected or is absent , the reflected particles and the fraction of particles that participate to the first fermi cycle constitute a relativistic cold beam that pervades the ambient plasma and trigger three major micro - instabilities .",
    "one is the two stream electrostatic instability , which amplifies the electrostatic langmuir field through a erenkov resonant interaction @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "another is the weibel instability , with @xmath71 and its analog filamentation instability , with @xmath72 ( bret , firpo & deutsch 2004 , 2005a , 2005b ; see also bret 2009 for a recent compilation ) .",
    "these two instabilities are non - resonant and mostly electromagnetic with a low phase velocity so that the magnetic component of the wave is dominant .",
    "it is thus particularly relevant for developing particle scattering .",
    "finally , these authors have also discovered an oblique resonance which grows faster than the above two .",
    "it is mostly longitudinal ( see further below ) but @xmath73 is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the beam .",
    "these growth rates are easily recovered as follows .    for a cold beam , eq .",
    "( [ eq : beams ] ) gives the following susceptibility : @xmath74 \\ .\\ ] ] the beam propagates with velocity @xmath75 ; the relativistic beam plasma frequency ( in the upstream frame ) is given by : @xmath76 recalling @xmath77 .",
    "one can solve the dispersion relation , including the beam response , to first order in @xmath78 since its contribution is of order : @xmath79      consider now a mode with @xmath80 , but @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",

    ", the two stream instability resonance condition between the langmuir modes and the beam reads : @xmath92 with by assumption @xmath93 .",
    "after insertion into eq .",
    "( [ eq : long1 ] ) , this yields : @xmath94 hence a growth rate : @xmath95 one should note that the erenkov resonance can only take place with plasma modes with phase velocity smaller than @xmath96 ( refraction index @xmath97 ) , hence transverse modes are excluded in this respect .",
    "the oblique mode , with @xmath82 and a resonance as above yields a growth rate that is larger by a factor @xmath98 than the two stream rate given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : long ] ) for @xmath99 ( bret , firpo & deutsch 2004 , 2005a , b ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the instability arises from the @xmath100 component of the beam susceptibility tensor , which dominates over the other components at the resonance [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : chib ] ) ] , and which reads : @xmath101 this component is suppressed by @xmath102 when @xmath99 , which explains the factor appearing in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : long ] ) . for @xmath82",

    "however it also comprises a small electromagnetic component , @xmath108 , as can be seen by solving for the eigenmode , using the full dispersion relation including the beam contribution .",
    "as before , we look for an instability of the upstream plasma waves , triggered by the beam of accelerated ( and shock reflected ) particles . at non - relativistic shocks , one usually considers an interaction at the larmor resonance .",
    "however this can not be relevant in the ultra - relativistic case , because the interaction must develop on a distance scale @xmath109 which is itself much shorter than the larmor radius .",
    "the particular case of a relativistic parallel shock wave will be briefly discussed thereafter .",
    "note finally that for the frequently valid condition @xmath110 , the precursor has a length much larger than the minimum scale for mhd description ( @xmath111 ) , which justifies the resonance between the beam and the mhd modes .      in order to excite fast waves of frequency higher than the larmor frequency ,",
    "we consider again the erenkov resonance between the non - magnetized beam and the magnetized plasma waves : @xmath112 .",
    "let us recall that for a ultra - relativistic beam , the velocity distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath113 , even if the dispersion in lorentz factor of the beam is significant .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of generating the magnetic field through a ( non - resonant ) weibel ( filamentation ) instability with @xmath114 .",
    "this instability taking place in the shock transition layer between the unshocked plasma and the shocked plasma has been discussed in detail in the waterbag approximation for an unmagnetized plasma ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ; wiersma & achterberg 2004 ; lyubarsky & eichler 2006 ; achterberg & wiersma 2007 , achterberg , wiersma & norman 2007 ) . as we now argue , the weibel instability can also proceed in the regime of unmagnetized proton ",

    "we write down the dispersion relation in a frame in which the @xmath116 plane has been rotated in such a way as to align @xmath117 with the third axis , denoted @xmath118 ; @xmath119 remains the second axis @xmath120 . to simplify further a cumbersome algebra",
    ", we consider a wavenumber @xmath121 , perpendicular to both the beam motion and the magnetic field .",

    "one needs to rotate the beam susceptibility tensor to this @xmath122 frame .",
    "the quantity of interest will turn out to be the @xmath127 component @xmath128 . to first order in @xmath78 , the dispersion relation indeed",
    "has the solution : @xmath129 given the dependence of @xmath130 on @xmath131 , this is a quartic equation which admits the solution leading to the weibel ( filamentation ) instability : @xmath132 as in the unmagnetized case , it saturates at a growth rate @xmath133 ( up to the angular dependence on @xmath122 ) .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath134 , this instability does not disappear . in order to see this",
    ", one has to consider the other branch of the dispersion relation , for @xmath135 , @xmath136 : @xmath137 one of the roots corresponds to the whistler mode and the other to the weibel unstable mode with @xmath138 .",
    "the above thus shows that fast waves can be excited by the relativistic stream in the intermediate range between mhd and electron dynamics , i.e. with unmagnetized plasma ions but magnetized electrons .",
    "the typical length scale of these waves for which maximal growth occurs is obviously the electron inertial scale @xmath139 as before .",
    "the previous discussion of the erenkov instability with electrostatic modes can be generalized to the magnetized plasma limit by considering those modes with @xmath140 , which do not feel the magnetic field ( see lyubarsky 2002 for a discussion of this instability in the case of pulsar magnetospheres ) . rewriting the above plasma di - electric tensor for a wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field",
    ", it is straightforward to see that the dispersion relation admits the longitudinal branch given by : @xmath141 in order to avoid confusion , it may be useful to stress that the previous _ oblique _ denomination refers to the angle between the wavenumber and the beam direction , while the present term _ longitudinal _ here refers to the parallel nature of @xmath73 and @xmath142 . at the erenkov resonance @xmath143 , with @xmath144 ,",

    "additional constraints can be obtained as follows .",
    "first of all , the above derivation of the instabilities has assumed the beam to be unmagnetized , i.e. that the growth time be much shorter than the larmor time of the beam particles .",
    "this condition is always easily satisfied , since it reads : @xmath240 for the weibel instability , @xmath241 for the longitudinal mode and @xmath242 for the whistler erenkov resonant mode .",
    "one can explicit the dependence of @xmath225 on the shock parameters in order to verify this ; for the weibel instability , the condition amounts to @xmath243 , which is indeed easily verified at large lorentz factors .    concerning the erenkov resonant modes",
    ", one must also require that @xmath244 in order for the perturbative treatment to be apply . in the case of longitudinal modes",

    "however , for whistler modes of smaller eigenfrequency , this implies a non - trivial constraint @xmath246 which can be translated into @xmath247 for @xmath248 .",
    "further bounds can be obtained by requiring that the background protons are non - magnetized in the case of the weibel instability , which requires @xmath249 .",
    "this condition is however superseded by the requirement that the growth can occur on the precursor length scale , since @xmath250 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfb ] ) ] . at this stage , it is important to point out a fundamental difference between the erenkov resonant instabilities and the weibel / filamentation instabilities . the former have , by definition of the resonance , a phase velocity along the shock normal which , to zeroth order in @xmath251 exceeds the shock velocity , while the latter have vanishing phase velocity along @xmath252 .",
    "therefore the timescale available for the growth of these non - resonant waves is the crossing time of the precursor : they are sourced at a typical distance @xmath44 away from the shock , then advected downstream on this timescale .",
    "regarding the resonant modes , their phase velocity along @xmath252 is @xmath253 , with @xmath254 . since @xmath255 for the resonant modes , one must consider three possible cases : ( i ) @xmath256 , in which case the mode is advected away on a timescale @xmath257 as for the non - resonant modes ; ( ii ) @xmath258 , in which case the mode propagates forward , but exits the precursor ( where it is sourced ) on a similar timescale ; and ( iii ) @xmath259 , in which case the mode can be excited on a timescale @xmath260 and where the divergence corresponds to the situation of a mode surfing on the shock precursor",
    ". however condition ( i ) appears to be the most likely , as least in the ultra - relativistic limit , for it amounts to @xmath261 .",
    "indeed , all resonant instabilities have a growth rate @xmath262 where @xmath131 is the eigenfrequency of the resonant mode ( an exception is the upper hybrid mode for which the growth rate is smaller by @xmath263 , in which case the following condition is even stronger ) , therefore the condition @xmath261 can be rewritten as @xmath264 , which is generically satisfied .",
    "this means that the phase velocity of the resonant modes , when corrected by the effect of the beam becomes smaller than the shock front velocity , so that these modes are advected on a timescale @xmath265 and transmitted downstream , after all . for the purpose of magnetic field amplification downstream and particle acceleration ,",
    "this is certainly noteworthy , as such true plasma eigenmodes ( whistler , alfvn , extraordinary and electrostatic longitudinal or oblique modes ) can be expected to have a longer lifetime than the weibel modes .",

    "one should not infer from the simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) that superluminal shock waves can not lead to magnetic field amplification .",
    "this conclusion entirely depends on the level of magnetization .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to extend the pic simulations down to weakly magnetized shocks with @xmath296 in order to probe the limit at which the oblique mode can grow .      in the ultra - relativistic limit , parallel shock waves are non - generic ; however , they may lead more easily to particle acceleration than superluminal shock waves ( since the argument discussed in lemoine , pelletier & revenu 2006 no longer applies ) and consequently provide interesting observational signatures .",
    "one can extend the above discussion to the case of parallel shock waves as follows .",
    "first of all , the main limitation of the instabilities , that is due to the precursor crossing timescale disappears in the limit @xmath297 as a fraction @xmath298 of the particles can propagate to upstream infinity ( at least in the limit of a fully coherent magnetic field ) .",

    "of course , the actual precursor length remains finite as a result of the influence of large and short scale turbulence . in the following",

    "we also choose to discuss the limitations as a function of @xmath224 and @xmath225 , but at a fixed value of @xmath308 . the fact that @xmath309 and that @xmath310 is fixed modifies slightly the limitations derived previously .",

    "the growth of instabilities observed in the simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) is thus likely due to the erenkov resonance with the longitudinal modes that propagate along the magnetic field , which does not suffer from these constraints .",
    "the above also allows to understand the abrupt transition as a function of shock obliquity : when @xmath329 , the growth of fluctuations is suddenly inhibited and so is fermi acceleration .",

    "fermi cycles may then develop provided the appropriate conditions discussed in lemoine , pelletier & revenu ( 2006 ) and pelletier , lemoine & marcowith ( 2009 ) are satisfied .",
    "these conditions have been discussed under the assumption of isotropic short scale magnetic turbulence , and we restrict ourselves to this assumption in the present work as well .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to generalize this discussion to more realistic turbulence configurations , as in hededal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , dieckmann , drury & shukla ( 2006 ) for instance .",
    "however , this clearly becomes more model dependent in terms of turbulence configuration and for this reason , we postpone such a study to future work .",
    "let us discuss first the case of upstream turbulence .",
    "when particles are scattered off short scale @xmath62 , but intense magnetic fluctuations , the scattering frequency of a relativistic particle of momentum @xmath331 is @xmath332 since the oblique mode dominates over the whistler and weibel waves over most of the parameter space , one can not ignore the influence of short scale electrostatic fields .",
    "these electrostatic waves lead to a second order fermi process in the upstream medium , with a concomittant pitch angle scattering .",
    "indeed , the particle scatters against random electric fields @xmath333 along the shock normal ( @xmath252 direction ) , gaining momentum @xmath334 , with @xmath335 at each interaction , and similarly in the perpendicular direction . the initial pitch angle of the particle ( with respect to the shock normal ) @xmath336 in the upstream frame , and the particle is overtaken by the shock wave whenever @xmath337 ( achterberg et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this pitch angle diffuses according to : @xmath338 for a correlation time @xmath339 .",
    "therefore we obtain a scattering rate similar to the previous one ( [ nus ] ) in which the magnetic field fluctuation is replaced by the electric field fluctuation : @xmath340 this correspondence justifies that we treat the short scale electric and magnetic fields on a similar footing and consider the total electromagnetic energy content",
    ". a conversion of a fraction of the energy of the beam into magnetic or electrostatic fluctuations is expected with @xmath341 , with typically @xmath342 and @xmath343 ( spitkovsky 2008a ) .",
    "scattering in the short scale electromagnetic turbulence will govern the scattering process if it leads to @xmath344 on a timescale @xmath345 , with @xmath346 the larmor radius of first generation cosmic rays as measured upstream relatively to the background magnetic field ( see the corresponding discussion in pelletier , lemoine & marcowith 2009 ) .",
    "if this short scale turbulence governs the scattering process , then fermi acceleration will operate .",

    "we will discuss the applicability of this inequality in concrete cases in the following sub - section .",
    "if this condition is not verified , the background unamplified magnetic field remains the main agent of particle scattering upstream . in this case",
    ", fermi acceleration cycles can develop only if short scale turbulence govern the scattering downstream of the shock wave .",
    "as discussed in pelletier , lemoine & marcowith ( 2009 ) , this requires : @xmath351 where all quantities should be evaluated in the downstream rest frame , and @xmath352 refers to the larmor radius of the accelerated particles in this frame .",
    "this double inequality amounts to requiring that @xmath353 , i.e. that the scattering time @xmath354 be shorter than the larmor time in the mean field @xmath355 in order to break the inhibition constraint of the mean field that tends to drag the particles in the downstream flow .",
    "the scattering must also develop in a special regime where the correlation time @xmath356 is shorter than the larmor time .",
    "regarding @xmath357 , two main spatial scales are to be envisaged : the previous upstream electron skin depth , if one assumes that the typical scale of transverse fluctuations is preserved through shock crossing , and the downstream electron skin depth , if reorganization takes place through shock crossing .",
    "assuming a typical electron temperature @xmath358 behind the shock , and accounting for shock compression of the electron density , this latter scale can actually be written as @xmath359 ( @xmath360 the _ upstream _ ion plasma frequency ) , a factor @xmath361 larger than the previous one .",
    "one should also envisage the possibility that the turbulence spectrum evolves to larger scales with time ( medvedev et al . 2005 ; lemoine & revenu 2006 ; katz , keshet & waxman 2007 ) but we will not do so here .",
    "let us consider the above two possibilities in turn .",
    "if @xmath362 ( upstream electron skin depth ) , then the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath363 and is therefore always satisfied .",
    "the second inequality amounts to @xmath364 , hence @xmath365 . this latter inequality is much more stringent . if satisfied , it means that the downstream short scale turbulence governs the scattering process , in particular it allows the particle to escape its orbit around the shock compressed background magnetic field on a timescale smaller than the larmor time in this field .",
    "this is a necessary condition for successful fermi cycles .    if @xmath366 ( equivalently , the downstream electron skin depth ) , then the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown ] ) becomes @xmath367 , which is always true .",
    "the second inequality reads @xmath368 ( or @xmath369 ) .",
    "we will summarize the two above two possible cases for @xmath370 and parameterize the uncertainty on @xmath370 by writing the condition as : @xmath371 with @xmath372 and @xmath373 .",
    "one should however recall that the typical scale of electromagnetic fluctuations could evolve with the distance to the shock front , as envisaged in medvedev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , lemoine & revenu ( 2006 ) and katz , keshet & waxman ( 2007 ) .",
    "this amounts to making @xmath374 be a growing function of the energy taking values larger than 1 .",
    "the above result clearly reveals the need for dedicated pic simulations of shock wave at moderate magnetisation , with realistic proton to mass ratio and geometry in order to reduce this large uncertainty on @xmath374 and determine the precise conditions under which fermi acceleration can take place .    to summarize this discussion",
    ", we obtain the following conditions for successful fermi acceleration . if eq .",
    "( [ eq : fup ] ) is satisfied [ or , to be more accurate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fup1 ] ) ] , then fermi acceleration will operate , because the short scale fluctuations produced upstream are sufficiently intense to govern the scattering . in this case , it is important to stress that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfb ] ) , which defines the length of the precursor , no longer applies .",
    "it should be replaced by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfu ] ) , which is larger . physically , the precursor widens , giving more time for the fluctuations to grow , thus reaching a higher efficiency in terms of @xmath375 . if eq .  ( [ eq : fup ] ) is not satisfied , e.g. because the upstream magnetization is not small enough , particles gyrate in the background magnetic field before experiencing the short scale turbulence",
    ". then fermi acceleration will operate if eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown2 ] ) is verified . consequently",
    ", a sufficient condition for the development of fermi cycles is @xmath376 , or equivalently @xmath377 , where @xmath378 is the maximum value of the upstream magnetization that allows turbulence to grow upstream and then be transferred downstream . as shown previously for a superluminal configuration , @xmath379 for an electron - proton plasma in the realistic case where @xmath380 so that the transition is governed by the excitation of whistler waves ; or @xmath381 for an electron - positron plasma , with the development of the oblique two stream instability .",
    "the spectral index and the maximal energy remain to be determined however . in this respect ,",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown ] ) provides an upper bound for this maximal energy : @xmath382 in the front frame .",
    "the more likely development of the fermi process is thus hybrid , in the sense that it is of drift type upstream and of diffusive type downstream .",
    "as fermi cycles develop , particles are accelerated beyond the energy @xmath383 considered here for the first generation .",
    "although they are less numerous , they stream farther ahead of the shock and are therefore liable to induce stronger amplification .",
    "one can only speculate about these issues , since the spectral index depends strongly on the assumption made on the shape of the turbulence spectra , upstream as well as downstream .",
    "in particular , if the magnetic field amplified downstream through the weibel instability decays on scales of order of tens or hundreds of electron inertial lengths @xmath38 , the particles will likely escape towards downstream because of the lack of scattering agents , thereby cutting off the fermi process prematurely .",
    "nevertheless , assuming for the sake of discussion that fermi cycles develop with a spectral index @xmath384 , the number density of cosmic rays streaming upstream scales as @xmath385 , with @xmath386 .",
    "the beam plasma frequency , which controls the growth rates of the instabilities , @xmath387 , whereas the precursor length @xmath388 . since the growth rates of the resonant instabilities which develop upstream scale as @xmath389",
    ", @xmath390 would guarantee that the growth factor of the instabilities triggered by these high energy particles exceeds that for the first generation .",
    "these findings seem in agreement with the numerical simulations of keshet et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) who observe wave growth farther from the shock from high energy particles , as time increases .",
    "it is interesting to situate the relativistic shock waves of physical interest in the above diagram .",
    "here we consider three proto - typical cases : a pulsar wind , a gamma - ray burst external shock waves expanding in the interstellar medium , and a gamma - ray burst external shock wave propagating along a density gradient in a wolf - rayet wind .",
    "we find the following :    * pulsar winds : with @xmath391 and @xmath392 , one finds @xmath393 ; the level of magnetization is thus so high that no wave can grow , either upstream or downstream .",
    "fermi acceleration should consequently be inhibited . *",
    "gamma - ray burst external shock waves expanding in the interstellar medium : for @xmath394 and @xmath395 ( i.e. @xmath396 g ) , one finds @xmath397 .",
    "wave growth should be efficient both usptream and downstream .",
    "concerning fermi acceleration , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fup ] ) amounts to @xmath398 .",
    "it can thus be only marginally satisfied . however , eq .  ( [ eq : fdown2 ] ) is most likely satisfied , so that fermi acceleration should develop , even in the early afterglow phase when @xmath399 .",
    "* gamma - ray burst external shock waves propagating along a density gradient in a wolf - rayet wind : taking a surface magnetic field of @xmath400 for a @xmath401 wolf - rayet progenitor , the magnetization at distances of @xmath402 cm is @xmath403 ( crowther 2007 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath404 .",
    "growth may or may not occur in this case , depending on the precise values of @xmath405 , @xmath227 and @xmath45 . in detail , the condition for weibel growth @xmath291 is likely not verified for the above fiducial values , but could be verified in less magnetized winds and at later stages of evolution , with a smaller value of @xmath405 .",
    "the condition for growth of whistler waves , @xmath406 , may be satisfied if @xmath407 and it is likely to be more easily verified at smaller values of @xmath405 and @xmath227 .",
    "finally , the ( most stringent ) condition for growth of the oblique mode , eq .",
    "( [ eq : obllimmag ] ) , is likely not verified in the initial stages with @xmath408 and the above fiducial value of @xmath227 , but would be verified if @xmath227 were smaller .",
    "+ however , eq .  ( [ eq : fup ] )",
    "can not be satisfied in this case , meaning that the orbit of the particle upstream is governed by the wind magnetic field , not by the amplified short scale component . regarding the bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown2 ] ) , it can be satisfied , depending on the values of the wind magnetisation and most particularly on the value of @xmath374 .",
    "the possibility of fermi acceleration thus remains open in this case .",
    "more work is necessary to understand the properties of downstream turbulence in order to determine whether particle can eventually be accelerated .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we do not understand yet the structure of a relativistic shock front in detail . in the previous section",
    "we have assumed that the shock front is structured like a non - relativistic front and just extended the non - relativistic results .",
    "since mhd compressive instability and extraordinary ionic modes can be excited , we can not exclude that the foot be full of relativistically hot protons and electrons of similar temperature @xmath409 with @xmath410 . in that case",
    "the plasma response would be different , because the intermediate whistler range ( and also extraordinary range ) would disappear so that the plasma would behave like a relativistic pair plasma .",
    "then , the relevant instabilities are the weibel and oblique modes ( in the unmagnetized approximation ) .",
    "the length of the precursor and the weibel growth rate remain unchanged , hence the domain of growth of the weibel instability also remains unchanged .",
    "the growth rate of the oblique mode is however reduced because the background plasma frequency is smaller by a ratio @xmath411 .",
    "therefore the condition of growth on the advection timescale now reads @xmath412 .",
    "the ratio of the growth rates of the oblique mode to the weibel mode can be written as @xmath413 , hence the weibel instability becomes the dominant mode if @xmath414 .    in the downstream plasma ,",
    "the magnetic fluctuations generated by the weibel instability are expected to disappear rapidly because they do not correspond to plasma modes .",
    "whistler and other resonant eigenmodes ( when they are excited ) are however transmitted and although they are not excited downstream , their damping is weak .",
    "when fermi cycles develop , they create `` inverted '' distribution downstream , that should produce a maser effect .    tangled magnetic field carried by the upstream flow",
    "are very compressed downstream and thus opposite polarization field lines come close together .",
    "this should produce magnetic reconnections in an unusual regime where protons and electrons have a similar relativistic mass of order @xmath415 .",
    "such a regime of reconnection deserves a specific investigation with appropriate numerical simulations . despite magnetic dissipation",
    ", reconnections would probably create a chaotic flow that favors diffusion of particles from downstream to upstream .",
    "in this work , we have carried out a detailed study of the micro - instabilities at play in the precursor of a ultra - relativistic shock wave .",
    "the main limitation for the growth of these waves is related to the length of precursor , which is itself related to the level of magnetisation in the upstream plasma ( where magnetisation refers to the background field , not the shock generated short scale fields ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have found electronic and ionic instabilities that grow sufficiently fast in the precursor of a relativistic shock .",
    "the fastest growing instabilities are due to the erenkov resonance between the beam of accelerated ( and shock reflected protons ) and the upstream plasma whistler waves and electrostatic modes .",
    "the weibel instability , which is non - resonant by essence , is also excited , but its growth is generally superseded by that of the previous modes . the strongest amplification occurs on very short spatial scales @xmath416 , the electron skin depth in the upstream plasma .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy_perp ] for the generic case of relativistic superluminal shock waves , which delimits the domains in which electromagnetic modes are excited in terms of shock lorentz factor and upstream magnetisation and defines the critical value @xmath417 of the magnetization below which fermi process can operate .",
    "figure [ fig : xy_par ] presents the corresponding limitations for the case of parallel shock waves ; in this case , the growth of instabilities is made much easier by the divergence of the precursor length for a fraction of the particles returning upstream .",
    "our results explain some features of recent pic simulations of relativistic pair shocks of various geometries and magnetisation levels .",
    "we have discussed the conditions under which fermi acceleration can proceed superluminal shock waves once a significant fraction of the cosmic ray energy has been dumped into these short scale electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "fermi acceleration can operate if the upstream magnetisation ( @xmath227 ) or downstream magnetisation ( @xmath418 ) are low enough for the shock generated turbulence to govern the scattering of particles .",
    "this is the second condition that states the required level of electromagnetic energy density versus the magnetization .",
    "this requires either @xmath419 ( for upstream scattering ) , which is however difficult to fulfill or @xmath420 ( for downstream scattering , which is easily fulfilled with a low level of turbulence ) ; @xmath64 indicates the fraction of incoming energy transferred into electromagnetic fluctuations , with @xmath421 generally indicated by pic simulations , and @xmath374 is a fudge factor that encaptures our ignorance of the transfer of electromagnetic modes excited upstream through the shock , @xmath373 ( and it may be even larger depending on the particle energy if the scale of the electromagnetic flucutations evolves with the distance to the shock ) . we emphasize the need for pic simulations with realistic geometry , realistic proton to electron mass ratios and moderate magnetisation ( of order of the above ) in order to lift this uncertainty on @xmath374 and to determine the precise conditions under which fermi acceleration can take place .",
    "this limitation also places a strict upper bound on the maximum energy that is achievable through the fermi process , namely @xmath422 , with @xmath378 the maximum magnetisation that allows waves to grow , and @xmath227 the upstream background magnetisation ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdown2 ] ) . beyond this intrinsic limit , the scattering time indeed becomes longer than the larmor time in the mean field downstream , so that the particle is advected downstream by the mean field and fermi cycles end .",
    "we have also applied our calculations to several cases of astrophysical interest . in practice , we find that terminal shocks of pulsar winds have a magnetisation level that is too high to allow for the amplification of short scale electromagnetic fields , so that particle acceleration must be inhibited . we have found that gamma - ray burst external shock waves propagating into a typical interstellar medium should lead to strong amplification of the magnetic field and to fermi cycles , even at high lorentz factor .",
    "the energies reached by the suprathermal electrons can easily explain the afterglow emission through jitter radiation ( medvedev 2000 ) .",
    "however , if the shock wave propagates in a stellar wind , the upstream magnetisation may be too large to allow for particle acceleration , eventhough magnetic field amplification should take place .",
