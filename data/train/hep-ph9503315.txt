    "there is little disagreement today that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the correct theory underlying strong - interaction physics .",
    "thus , the physics of nuclei is , in essence , an exercise in applied qcd .",
    "indeed , from a fundamental perspective , _ the _ central problem in theoretical nuclear physics is to develop connections between observed nuclear phenomena and the interactions and symmetries of the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom .    on the other hand , knowledge of the fundamental underlying theory",
    "has had very little impact , to date , on the study of low- and medium - energy nuclear phenomena .",
    "two general difficulties hinder the application of quantum chromodynamics to nuclear physics .",
    "the first is that , in this energy regime , the strong interaction is , in fact , strong ; straightforward perturbation theory in the effective qcd coupling constant fails .",
    "therefore we need an alternative expansion scheme or an approach to directly approximate qcd nonperturbatively .",
    "the second difficulty is the mismatch of energy scales between hadronic and nuclear physics .",
    "characteristic qcd scales for light - quark hadrons , which are the building blocks of nuclei , are hundreds of mev up to several gev .",
    "the dynamics of nuclei , in contrast , is a delicate and subtle enterprise involving physics at much smaller scales and featuring sensitive cancellations .",
    "typical nuclear observables are on the scale of a few mev or perhaps tens of mev .",
    "consider , for example , the phenomenon of nuclear matter saturation .",
    "the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 16 mev @xcite , which is less than 2% of the nucleon s mass .",
    "an error of a few percent in the binding could easily lead to errors at the level of nuclear physics scales , which would render any calculation useless .",
    "thus , an accurate description of nuclear matter _",
    "saturation _ or comparable properties directly from qcd must entail very precise calculations .",
    "how , then , might one proceed to relate qcd and nuclear phenomena ?",
    "an _ indirect _ approach is to focus on the implications and constraints of qcd symmetries by developing effective field theories ( eft s ) for nuclei .",
    "the prototype eft for strong - interaction physics is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , which provides a systematic expansion in energy for low - energy scattering processes .",
    "the degrees of freedom are the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry ( pions , _ etc . _ ) and , when appropriate , nucleons .",
    "this approach builds in constraints due to chiral symmetry without any additional constraints on the dynamics or _",
    "ad hoc _ model assumptions . physics beyond chiral symmetry is incorporated through constants in the low - energy lagrangian , which are usually determined from experiment , although in principle they could be determined directly from qcd . because additional constants are needed at each stage in the energy expansion , chpt is predictive only at sufficiently low energies , where the number of parameters introduced does not overwhelm the data to be described .",
    "the prospects for extending chpt in a useful way to calculations at finite density are unclear at present , although some progress has been made on the few - body problem @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can pursue a more _ direct _ approach by focusing on the properties of hadrons rather than nuclear matter saturation .",
    "if we can successfully describe hadronic resonances in the vacuum using qcd , we might be able to extend this description to hadronic properties at finite density .",
    "the most complete approach to hadronic physics at zero density uses monte carlo simulations of qcd on a discrete ( euclidean ) space - time lattice .",
    "significant and steady progress has been made on such calculations in recent years .",
    "( for a review of the current state of the art , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the prospects for extending these lattice calculations to finite density are unclear ; there are certainly formidable obstacles .",
    "one major difficulty is that the functional determinant that arises with a nonzero chemical potential is not positive definite , and hence standard monte carlo techniques can not be applied in a straightforward manner @xcite . in addition , realistic nuclear matter calculations may require significantly larger lattices than are required for single hadrons ; there must be enough room for a sufficiently large number of nucleons .",
    "even with significant progress on these problems , useful lattice calculations at finite density will not be available in the near future .    to make progress",
    ", we turn instead to qcd sum rules .",
    "the qcd sum - rule approach has proven to be a useful way of extracting qualitative and quantitative information about hadronic physics ( masses and coupling constants ) from qcd inputs .",
    "the method was introduced by shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov in the late 1970 s @xcite and applied to describe mesonic properties .",
    "an important extension was made by ioffe , who showed how the technique could be used to describe baryons @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are several detailed reviews of the subject @xcite .    in this review",
    ", we will discuss how qcd sum - rule methods can be generalized to describe hadrons propagating in nuclear matter .",
    "the pioneering attempts to apply sum rules to finite - density systems were made by drukarev and levin @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a variety of approaches were developed , differing in focus and technical detail . here",
    "we will emphasize the treatment of baryons in infinite nuclear matter , and we will closely follow the philosophy and technical approach of refs .",
    "@xcite for nucleons and refs .",
    "@xcite for hyperons .",
    "the properties of vector mesons in the nuclear medium will be discussed following the treatment in refs .",
    "we will also comment on alternative formulations of the problem .",
    "qcd sum rules focus on momentum - space correlation functions ( also called correlators ) of local composite operators [ for example , see eq .",
    "( [ nucleon_corr_def ] ) ] .",
    "each composite operator is constructed using quark and/or gluon fields so as to carry the quantum numbers of the hadron we wish to study ; we will refer to such operators as interpolating fields .",
    "correlation functions of interpolating fields are also the basic objects of lattice investigations ( but in euclidean coordinate space ) .",
    "but while the lattice correlators are calculated from first principles in quantum chromodynamics with a precision that can be systematically improved , sum - rule calculations rely on some phenomenological input and have limited ( but generally understood ) accuracy @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of qcd sum rules is to match a qcd description of an appropriate correlation function with a phenomenological one .",
    "the underlying concept is `` duality , '' which establishes a correspondence between a description in terms of physical ( hadronic ) degrees of freedom and one based on the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "a generic qcd sum - rule calculation consists of three main parts : 1 ) an approximate description of the correlation function in terms of qcd degrees of freedom via an _ operator product expansion _ ( ope ) , 2 ) a description of the same correlator in terms of physical intermediate states through a lehmann representation ( _ i.e. _ dispersion relation ) @xcite that incorporates a simple ansatz for the spectral density , and 3 ) a procedure for matching these two descriptions and extracting the parameters of the spectral function that characterize the hadronic state of interest .",
    "the concept of an operator product expansion was introduced by wilson in the 1960 s @xcite ; the ope is reviewed in ref .",
    "as applied in qcd sum rules , the ope expresses a correlator of interpolating fields as a sum of @xmath2-number coefficients ( called wilson coefficients ) times expectation values of composite local operators constructed from quark and gluon fields .",
    "these expectation values are referred to as _",
    "condensates_.    the essence of the ope is the separation of short - distance and long - distance physics , or , in momentum space , large and small ( spacelike ) momenta . in qcd",
    "this separation , to a large extent , corresponds to a separation between perturbative physics ( the coefficients ) and nonperturbative physics ( the condensates ) .",
    "this suggests that the coefficients can be calculated from qcd via perturbation theory @xcite , while the nonperturbative physics is isolated in the condensates . in principle , the condensates are calculable directly from qcd ( for example , using lattice simulations ) , but in practice they are usually determined phenomenologically from one set of sum rules and applied to others .",
    "the sum rules are predictive because a relatively small number of condensates dominate the descriptions of many observables @xcite .",
    "the possibility of matching the ope - based description with the phenomenological description is often viewed by nonpractitioners with skepticism ; it seems like magic .",
    "the ope is essentially a short - distance expansion , and at any finite order it can only describe the correlation function accurately at sufficiently large spacelike momenta . on the other hand ,",
    "we wish to learn about the low - lying excitations in the spectral function , which one expects to dominate the correlation function only at nearby timelike momenta or the low - momentum spacelike regime .",
    "how , then , is there any hope of matching the two ?",
    "the secret is that the phenomenological spectral density ( _ i.e. _ , the sum over physical states ) can be smeared in energy to a significant degree while preserving basic information on well - defined low - energy excitations ( hadrons ) . on the other hand",
    ", the smearing corresponds to short times so that the dual description of the spectral density in terms of the quark and gluon ope is adequate .",
    "the conversion from a momentum - space correlator to a smeared spectral function is conventionally achieved by applying a borel transform @xcite ( see sec .  [ sectii_iv ] ) .    as will be discussed in the course of this review , there are definite limitations of the sum - rule approach , and one must take care in applying sum rules to new domains , as we do here .",
    "we wish to warn the reader at the outset that it is rather easy to get totally incorrect results when using ( or , rather , abusing ) qcd sum rules .",
    "the basic dangers are that the phenomenological and ope descriptions at the level of approximation used for each simply may not match well enough to give reliable information or that some new feature of the physics is omitted .",
    "if , however , one nevertheless proceeds to extract phenomenological information , this information will likely be spurious .",
    "the need for internal and external consistency checks can not be overstressed .    keeping this in mind , the extension of the sum rules to finite density is , in principle , straightforward : simply take expectation values in a finite - density ground state rather than in the vacuum . consequently , we study the propagation of hadrons in infinite nuclear matter . in nature",
    ", of course , infinite nuclear matter does not exist .",
    "why then do we study this somewhat unphysical system rather than real finite nuclei ?",
    "in fact , infinite nuclear matter is in many ways a more general and fundamental problem .",
    "after all , the nuclear interaction saturates , and the centers of medium and large nuclei all look roughly like nuclear matter . by working with an infinite system",
    ", we isolate the physics that is related to qcd dynamics and not to details of the many - body physics of finite systems .",
    "furthermore , we can exploit the similarities to the vacuum formulation ( including , for example , translational invariance ) .",
    "the vacuum sum rules can be recovered in the zero - density limit , and we can take ratios to divide out certain systematic errors .",
    "the price we pay is that we do not make direct predictions of experimental observables .",
    "to do so one needs to make model - dependent assumptions , such as local - density approximations , to relate calculations of nuclear matter properties to experimental observables of finite nuclei .",
    "thus we are ultimately forced to compare with phenomenology rather than with experimental data .",
    "one has to confront , in addition , a basic limitation of the sum - rule approach ; namely , the spectral information that can be extracted is necessarily approximate and can not be systematically improved .",
    "for example , the extraction of hadronic masses with a reliability of better than @xmath3100mev is typically not possible @xcite .",
    "thus the approach is not sufficiently precise to make detailed calculations of the nuclear matter ground state at the scale of a few mev , the natural scale for much of low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "however , another limitation of the approach , the fact that it is not a self - consistent dynamical theory , turns out , in this context , to be a virtue . in the sum - rule approach",
    ", one does not dynamically solve for the ground state of the theory .",
    "rather , one _ characterizes _ the ground state : the qcd description of the ground state is characterized by various expectation values of composite operators .",
    "thus the approach need not be precise enough to calculate the ground state reliably ; as long as one has a reasonable way to extract these condensates phenomenologically , one can proceed to study the qualitative features of excitations without actually solving the ground - state problem .",
    "although one can avoid solving for the nuclear matter ground state , the approximate nature of the sum - rule approach means that one must use extreme care if using the method to extract quantities that are small on the scale of hadronic physics .",
    "thus , the use of the technique to describe fine details of low - energy nuclear physics must depend on the construction of reliable sum rules for nuclear properties that are much more accurate ( in absolute terms ) than the sum rules have proven to be at the hadronic level .",
    "whether or not this will prove to be possible remains an open question , but we view any results for quantities at this scale with some skepticism .",
    "indeed , the question may be posed as to whether there are _ any _ properties in low- or intermediate - energy nuclear physics whose natural scale is sufficiently large as to make the sum - rule approach reasonable .",
    "if we go beyond direct experimental observables and turn to nuclear phenomenology , we _ can _ find quantities in low- and intermediate - energy nuclear physics whose natural scale is several hundred mev .",
    "the quantities we have in mind are the lorentz scalar and vector parts of the optical potential for a baryon propagating in nuclear matter . in the dirac phenomenology of nucleon - nucleus scattering @xcite ,",
    "the lorentz scalar piece of the real part of the optical potential for the nucleon is typically several hundred mev attractive while the ( time component of the ) lorentz vector piece is typically several hundred mev repulsive .",
    "we propose that qcd sum rules are a natural and reasonable way to study these quantities , and we focus our review on this goal .",
    "the dirac description of nucleons propagating in nuclear matter appears to be quite different from the conventional low - energy nuclear physics approach , in which the ( central ) optical potential is a few tens of mev .",
    "the latter nonrelativistic approach has been quite successful in describing cross sections in proton - nucleus scattering .",
    "dirac phenomenology describes cross sections equally well ; the reason is that only the sum of the scalar and vector potentials contributes to the cross section , and , because of large cancellations between the scalar and vector optical potentials , the sum is only a few tens of mev .",
    "furthermore , most of the phenomenological energy dependence of the nonrelativistic central potential at low energies arises simply from the nonrelativistic reduction of the dirac potentials , even when the latter are energy independent @xcite .    the most compelling support for the dirac approach comes from studies of spin observables such as the analyzing power and the spin rotation .",
    "these observables depend on the _ difference _ between the scalar and vector potentials , and , given the opposite sign , this difference is many hundreds of mev . the phenomenological evidence in favor of this description is based on direct fits of optical potentials to describe simultaneously the spin observables and cross sections @xcite .",
    "moreover , a relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) gives optical potentials that are qualitatively similar to the empirical fits @xcite .",
    "further , in relativistic structure calculations , there is evidence that keeping track separately of scalar and vector parts leads to phenomenologically desirable density dependences and nonlocalities @xcite .",
    "while the dirac approach has been quite successful phenomenologically , it has also been quite controversial @xcite .",
    "we believe that much of this controversy is misplaced , involving issues of how dirac phenomenology is to be interpreted rather than the fundamental underlying issues of physics ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : diracsense ] ) .",
    "however , in light of this controversy , it is important to ask whether there is any evidence from qcd in favor of the qualitative picture of dirac phenomenology . from a phenomenological perspective , the question is not whether the nucleon should be thought of as a point dirac particle ; it is clear that the composite structure of the nucleon plays an essential role in the dynamics .",
    "the key question , however , is whether the optical potential for the nucleon has large and canceling pieces that transform as scalars and vectors under lorentz transformations .",
    "if qcd sum rules can be implemented so as to separately describe the scalar and vector parts of the optical potential , then we can test whether the scalar and vector parts of the optical potential have the sign and scale suggested by dirac phenomenology .",
    "if the large - scale changes at nuclear matter densities implied by dirac phenomenology are to be reconciled with qcd through sum rules , we must expect to find correspondingly large changes in the qcd description .",
    "is this plausible ?",
    "an important clue comes from the chiral condensate , which is the expectation value of the operator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an up or down quark field .",
    "the chiral condensate is often taken as the order parameter for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . as shown by ioffe @xcite , this condensate plays a central role in the qcd sum - rule determination of the nucleon mass .",
    "this role is consistent with chiral models of the nucleon and is plausible from rather general considerations ; ",
    "t  hooft s @xcite anomaly matching conditions require massless nucleons ( for massless quarks ) if chiral symmetry is not broken .",
    "thus , it comes as no surprise that the amount of chiral symmetry breaking ( which is measured by the chiral condensate ) is correlated with the nucleon s mass .",
    "so our question becomes : is the chiral condensate in nuclear matter very different from its free space value ?",
    "in fact , the chiral condensate in medium can be estimated in a reasonably reliable way ( for an overview of the current state of affairs , see the review by birse @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of the chiral condensate in the interior of nuclei is reduced from its vacuum value by @xmath640% @xcite ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chiralcon ] ) . to the extent that the chiral condensate controls the nucleon mass",
    ", one might naively expect the mass of a nucleon in the nuclear medium to be reduced by @xmath640% .",
    "this may seem absurd ; after all , the empirical binding energy per nucleon in nuclear matter is approximately 16 mev @xcite , while @xmath640% of the nucleon mass is several hundred mev .",
    "in fact , however , in addition to a shift in the nucleon mass ( which is a lorentz scalar ) , the in - medium nucleon energy can depend on a self - energy that transforms as a lorentz four - vector . for qualitative consistency with experiment and dirac phenomenology",
    ", one needs to find that the vector contribution is repulsive in nuclear matter and largely cancels the scalar attraction .",
    "as we will show , under certain assumptions about condensates , qcd sum rules predict this qualitative behavior for the optical potential @xcite .",
    "of course , nucleons are not the only hadrons .",
    "the same methods that are used to describe nucleon self - energies in medium can be directly adapted to describe optical potentials ( self - energies ) of other baryons in nuclear matter .",
    "again , we might expect that large changes in the chiral condensate ( along with changes in other condensates ) will imply large effects .",
    "this raises issues similar to the ones in nucleon propagation : are large and canceling lorentz scalar and vector optical potentials predicted for other baryons ?",
    "are the sum - rule predictions consistent with experiment and phenomenology ?",
    "these calculations provide important consistency checks on the sum - rule predictions for nucleons .",
    "there are ongoing studies of various baryons ; in this review , we will consider hyperon propagation through nuclear matter @xcite , for which there is phenomenology to confront .",
    "in addition to baryons , one can consider meson propagation at finite density .",
    "the case of vector mesons , is particularly interesting and important , in part , because changes in vector - meson masses have been proposed as an explanation for anomalies in electron scattering @xcite and @xmath7 scattering data @xcite , and , in part , because measurements of dilepton pairs emerging from a heavy - ion collision may provide a more - or - less direct experimental probe @xcite .",
    "if vector mesons are created in the medium , they have a nonzero amplitude for decay into two leptons .",
    "since the electromagnetic interaction is weak , the dilepton pair has a good probability of leaving the nucleus unscathed , providing essentially unfiltered information about the vector meson in the nucleus .",
    "a number of heavy - ion experiments have been proposed to look for shifts in vector - meson masses via study of dilepton pairs @xcite .",
    "in addition , the use of the virtual compton process ( @xmath8,dilepton ) might provide an even cleaner probe of the vector meson in medium @xcite .",
    "in this section , we review the qcd sum - rule approach as applied to the calculation of hadronic masses in the vacuum , _ i.e. _ , at zero density .",
    "an overview of qcd sum - rule methods and results is provided by the recent book edited by shifman @xcite , which includes a collection of reprints along with an up - to - date commentary by the editor and others . since thorough technical reviews exist , we will focus here on features and analogies that make the generalization to the finite - density problem more straightforward and plausible .",
    "the designation `` qcd sum rules '' is often confusing to the nonexpert . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "there are various relations referred to as `` sum rules , '' which have nothing to do with the approach we are concerned with here .",
    "for example , there are many sum rules that originated with the parton model : bjorken sum rule , ellis - jaffe sum rule , gottfried sum rule , _",
    "etc_. these typically are relations that manifest a constraint on properties of constituents , such as a conservation law .",
    "so , for example , all of the momenta ( or strangeness ) of the constituents must add up to the total momentum ( or strangeness ) .",
    "in contrast , the type of sum rule we are concerned with here is typified by the dipole sum rules of atomic and nuclear physics .",
    "consider photo - absorption by nuclei .",
    "the cross section for the excitation of a final state @xmath9 by a photon of energy @xmath10 is ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the dipole operator for e1 radiation in the @xmath13 direction , which can excite states that have isovector , @xmath14 quantum numbers .",
    "the total cross section for dipole absorption is found by summing over all possible final states and integrating over the energy : @xmath15 where we have defined the _ energy - weighted dipole sum rule _",
    "@xmath16    on the other hand , one can use completeness to rewrite @xmath17 as a ground - state matrix element involving @xmath12 and the hamiltonian @xmath18 @xcite : @xmath19 | 0 \\rangle \\ .\\ ] ] the double commutator can be directly evaluated in a theoretical model . for example , if we model the nucleon - nucleon interaction to have no exchange mixtures and to be velocity independent , we can evaluate the commutator immediately ( and obtain the trk result ) @xcite . more generally , we will have to do an approximate model calculation .",
    "the sum rule consists of the equality between the ground - state matrix element , which can be approximated in a theoretical model , and the sum over excited states , which is a weighted average of experimental observables .",
    "the operator @xmath12 is the analog of the interpolating field in qcd sum rules , while @xmath20 is the analog of the spectral density .",
    "various general observations can be made about these sum rules , which will carry over to analogous qcd sum rules :    1 .",
    "if one uses different multipole operators , different intermediate states ( corresponding to different quantum numbers ) are excited .",
    "thus one can investigate isoscalar or isovector states , and monopole , dipole , quadrupole excitations , and so on .",
    "for qcd sum rules , we choose an interpolating field that excites a particular channel of intermediate states which includes the hadron of interest ( _ e.g. _ , nucleon or @xmath21 meson ) .",
    "2 .   one can choose an operator that does nt actually correspond to a physically realizable experiment .",
    "the matrix elements in the sum over states may not be measured in a real experiment , but a sum rule can relate their values to a theoretical calculation . furthermore , in qcd there is the additional possibility of a _ numerical _ experiment to establish this sum , through lattice calculations .",
    "3 .   one can choose different weighting functions for the sum rule and thereby change the weight in the sum over states ( _ cf_.   dispersion relation ) .",
    "for example , given a single - particle operator @xmath22 , we can derive the sum rule @xcite @xmath23 thus one has some freedom to adjust how important particular states are in the sum .",
    "in qcd sum rules , one finds that the weighting resulting from a _ borel transform _ of the correlation function is particularly effective .",
    "4 .   certain states may dominate the sum .",
    "the collective excitations known as giant resonances are a case in point .",
    "if a giant resonance largely dominates ( `` saturates '' ) the sum over states of the strength , then one obtains from the sum rule a direct connection between some experimental properties of this resonance and a theoretical calculation . furthermore , we can use the freedom of changing the weighting function to improve the dominance of the state of interest . note that one does not learn everything about the states , just certain matrix elements .    in qcd sum rules",
    ", we include an external parameter ( the borel mass ) that adjusts the weighting function .",
    "we seek a range of parameter values for which we find dominance by the hadronic state of interest as well as a reasonable theoretical approximation to the ground - state expectation value .",
    "that the latter goal is attainable in qcd is not obvious . in the next section ,",
    "we outline how it could be possible .",
    "shifman has compared the strategy of the sum - rule approach to the quantum - mechanical many - body problem of some external objects injected into a complicated medium @xcite .",
    "( this is what a green s function does , for example . )",
    "the picture is that , over time , the external objects will interact with themselves _ and _ with the medium and will eventually develop into a stationary state or , more generally , an approximate stationary state with a finite lifetime . in many - body systems , the latter is known as a quasiparticle , while the analog in particle physics is a hadronic resonance ( such as the @xmath21 meson ) .",
    "the objects can also develop into many other complicated states with the same quantum numbers , but our goal is to isolate some properties of the quasiparticle , such as its energy or amplitude for creation ( _ i.e. _ , the spectral weight ) .",
    "the medium is too complicated to solve microscopically .",
    "at best we might know some coarse , averaged thermodynamic properties .",
    "ideally we would simply evolve the system for large times ( but still less than the quasiparticle lifetime ) , so that the quasiparticle develops and becomes dominant . to do this , however , we would need to calculate the interactions of the objects with the medium and the reaction of the medium back on the objects . by assumption",
    "we can not calculate these details .",
    "suppose , however , that the characteristic time for the medium to react is long compared to the characteristic time for the external objects .",
    "then there is a window in time corresponding to some cycles of the developing bound state during which the medium is essentially frozen , and the objects see only coarse properties . yet",
    "it is enough time that some basic features of the bound state are established .",
    "then we have a chance to extrapolate from relatively short times !",
    "the key feature is the distinction in time scales .",
    "if certain aspects of the physics are established at short times , they can persist to the measurement at long times , even though the system appears very different .",
    "this is reminiscent of the parton model , as applied to deep - inelastic scattering . in the infinite - momentum frame",
    ", one sees a clear separation of time scales : the interaction of the photon with the constituent partons and the interaction of the constituents among themselves .",
    "one can calculate the cross section for inclusive scattering using partons and get the right answer , even though there are strong ( confining ) final - state interactions and the partons end up in detectors as hadrons .",
    "the analogy to qcd sum rules is that the medium is the qcd vacuum and the external objects are valence quarks ( or gluons ) with definite quantum numbers created by external currents ( which we specify ) .",
    "we are able to calculate the behavior only at relatively short times using the operator product expansion .",
    "the coarse properties of the medium seen by the valence quarks are characterized by vacuum matrix elements of quark and gluon fields , called condensates . the question of whether there really is a favorable relation of the time scale characteristic of the valence quarks and that of the vacuum fluctuations is not clearcut in qcd , and seems to depend strongly on the channel @xcite",
    "however , for light - quark hadrons , the existence of two mass ( or time ) scales has been postulated in various contexts ( for example , georgi and manohar s chiral quark model @xcite ) . the vacuum response is characterized by times of order @xmath24 .",
    "the shorter time scale for the light - quark hadrons might be set by the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "so one is comparing roughly @xmath25 to the mass of the @xmath21 meson or the nucleon .",
    "while this is not a huge difference , it may be sufficient to establish some dominant features of the ground state from the physics of chiral symmetry breaking before confining interactions play a direct role in the bound state .",
    "( compare to a quantum - mechanical system in a large box .",
    "the box serves to discretize the spectrum , but does not change the total cross section if we average over nearby levels @xcite . )",
    "this scenario is consistent with a picture of constituent quarks forming first , then becoming weakly bound at later times . indeed ,",
    "one of the basic physical predictions of qcd sum rules is that chiral symmetry breaking , as manifested by the chiral condensate , predominantly sets the scale for the masses of light - quark hadrons .",
    "the generalization of our analogy to finite density simply means that we inject valence quarks into a modified medium , the nuclear matter ground state .",
    "the background fields ( condensates ) seen by the injected quarks will be somewhat different , which would then be reflected in the predictions for self - energies at finite density .",
    "if we focus on quantities that are not strongly dependent on physics at large time scales , the successes of the vacuum sum rules should carry over to finite density .      in this section we review the basic qcd field operators to establish our notation and conventions .",
    "we start with the fields for the up , down , and strange quarks , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where we use @xmath29 for quark color indices and @xmath30 for dirac indices . due to isospin symmetry",
    ", we often do not distinguish between up and down quark flavors ; we use @xmath31 to refer to either an up or down quark field .",
    "the gluon field is denoted @xmath32 , where we use @xmath33 for gluon color indices and @xmath34 for lorentz indices .",
    "a matrix form of the gluon field is obtained by multiplying the color components of the gluon field by the generators of the su(3 ) lie algebra : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the su(3 ) generators in the fundamental representation ( @xmath37 are the gell - mann matrices @xcite ) .",
    "they satisfy the following relations : @xmath38=if^{abc}t^c\\ , \\hspace{0.5 in } { \\rm tr}(t^a)=0\\ , \\hspace{0.5 in } { \\rm tr}(t^a t^b)=\\mbox{$1\\over 2$}\\delta^{ab}\\ , \\label{lie_algebra}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are totally antisymmetric structure constants @xcite and tr denotes a trace over quark color indices .",

    "since we focus on _ changes _ in spectral properties with density , we are less sensitive to details that affect the _ absolute _ predictions of vacuum properties . we will rely on the cancellation of systematic discrepancies ( including those from the truncation to dimension - six operators ) by normalizing all finite - density self - energies to the zero - density prediction for the mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , even predictions with large uncertainties ( _ e.g. , _ 50% ) will be useful in assessing relativistic phenomenology .",

    "we review some elements of relativistic nuclear physics phenomenology .",
    "our discussion follows that of ref .",
    "our goal is twofold : to explain the basic physics underlying the approach and to give insight into the appropriate way to model the spectral density for qcd sum rules at finite density .",

    "the most significant success of relativistic nuclear physics has been the economical description of proton - nucleus spin observables at intermediate energies for a wide range of target nuclei .",
    "this problem has been studied both purely phenomenologically using a global parameterization of the scattering data @xcite and in a meson - theoretical framework based on a relativistic impulse approximation @xcite .",
    "the key to the successes of both approaches is that nucleon propagation in the nuclear medium is described by a dirac equation featuring large lorentz scalar and vector optical potentials .",
    "that is , the nucleon wave function @xmath186 satisfies @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the scalar and vector optical potentials , @xmath169 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath10 is the nucleon energy .",
    "although the two approaches give slightly different optical potentials , the qualitative features are quite similar @xcite :    * attractive scalar ( @xmath190 ) and repulsive vector ( @xmath191 ) potentials are found , with magnitudes reaching several hundred mev at nuclear matter saturation density . *",
    "significant cancellation between the potentials occurs , so that the effective nonrelativistic central potential is only tens of mev in magnitude .",
    "* the scalar and vector imaginary parts also exhibit significant cancellation ; the imaginary parts are significantly smaller than the real parts .",
    "* the real parts of the potentials have relatively weak energy dependence .",
    "these qualities naturally suggest that a nucleon at intermediate energies can be regarded as a quasiparticle with large scalar and vector self - energies ( corresponding to the optical potentials ) .",
    "the imaginary parts of the optical potential indicate that the width in energy of the quasinucleon excitation is relatively small on hadronic scales ; that is , small compared to the spacing between the free - space nucleon and the roper resonance . as discussed below , a similar picture emerges for nucleons below the fermi sea in mean - field qhd @xcite or relativistic brueckner calculations @xcite .",
    "this picture is different from conventional descriptions based on nonrelativistic @xmath192 potentials .",
    "it is worth asking why one might expect such a picture .",
    "the empirical low - energy @xmath192 scattering amplitudes are conventionally parameterized using galilean invariants ; one might , instead , choose to express these amplitudes using lorentz invariants .",
    "in this case , one finds lorentz scalar and vector components that are much larger than the amplitudes deduced from the nonrelativistic decomposition . in ordinary , spin - saturated nuclear matter , all of the other lorentz components arising from the @xmath192 interaction largely average out , leaving only small effects ; these include terms arising from one - pion exchange .",
    "thus , the dynamics of neutral scalar and vector components are the most important for describing nucleons in bulk nuclear matter @xcite .    relativistic hadronic field theories of nuclear phenomena such as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) provide a qualitative description of this physics . in this description ,",
    "large scalar and vector self - energies emerge at the mean - field level from the interaction of a nucleon with all other nucleons in the fermi sea via the exchange of isoscalar scalar and vector mesons .",
    "this simple picture has many phenomenological successes ; for example , relativistic mean - field models provide a quantitatively accurate description of many bulk properties of nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the qcd sum rules we construct will not test this underlying dynamical picture of meson exchange as the origin of the quasinucleon self - energies .",
    "concerns about issues such as the use of the dirac equation to describe composite nucleons ( such as the role of z - graph physics ) have dominated the past discussion of connections between relativistic nuclear physics and qcd @xcite .",
    "we will briefly address some of these issues at the end of this article , but they do not affect our discussion . instead , we consider the _ spectral _ properties themselves , which can be studied outside the context of a hadronic model .",
    "having done such a study , one can compare to the predictions of dirac phenomenology or qhd .",
    "the critical questions are the magnitudes and signs of the lorentz scalar and vector parts of the optical potential .    to put this more concretely , we consider the nucleon propagator in a qhd theory @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the nuclear matter ground state and @xmath195 is a nucleon field @xcite .",

    "we will use these vectors to classify the possible terms in @xmath198 .",
    "there are only two independent vectors : @xmath200 itself and @xmath201 , the four - velocity of the matter .",
    "since @xmath201 will play an essential role in what follows , it is useful to give some feeling for what @xmath201 means .",
    "the key point is that infinite nuclear matter has a natural rest frame specified by @xmath202 : the frame in which the expectation value of the baryon current is zero for all spatial components ; the time component of the current in this frame is simply the baryon density @xmath203 . in the rest frame of nuclear matter ,",
    "the components of the four - velocity are @xmath204 .",
    "an alternative way to understand @xmath201 is to consider infinite nuclear matter as the limit of a finite nucleus when the mass and particle number go to infinity .",

    "the self - energy can be decomposed similarly ; this will define the notation used in subsequent sections .",

    "we know _ a priori _ that the optical potentials are complex and energy dependent .",
    "thus , although mean - field models successfully describe a wide range of phenomena , their simplicity leads us to question whether the basic physics survives in a more sophisticated analysis .",

    "this approximation incorporates effects from short - range correlations , which are critical in the nonrelativistic description of nuclear matter saturation .",
    "while these calculations involve some untested assumptions , they provide a unified and quantitative description of @xmath192 scattering observables and nuclear matter saturation properties .",

    "these are the two independent quantities we wish to extract ; when we generalize to the qcd case , these will be the quantities we want to extract via our spectral ansatz for the qcd nucleon correlator .",
    "note , however , that in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the on - shell self - energies are independent of @xmath219 , while the self - energies we extract from the sum rules will depend explicitly ( but weakly ) on @xmath219 .    evidently , to match the empirical fact that quasinucleon single - particle energies are mostly unchanged at nuclear matter density , we must find significant cancellation between @xmath214 and @xmath215 to keep @xmath221 roughly constant .",
    "in contrast , the mean - field ansatz predicts a significant shift of the negative - energy `` pole '' position @xmath222 with increasing density , since the scalar and vector self - energies are both attractive in this channel . in reality",
    ", we expect a broad distribution of strength rather than a narrow excitation , so the simple ansatz is far more realistic for the positive - energy quasinucleon than for the antinucleon .",
    "thus we find that , although a simple real momentum - independent description of the self - energies yields a plausible description of the nucleon in nuclear matter , it does a rather poor job of describing antinucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "it should be noted that this spread in the antinucleon strength occurs rather naturally in dirac phenomenologically . while the imaginary parts of the scalar and vector self - energies tend to cancel for the nucleon , they add for the antinucleon , implying a large imaginary self - energy and , hence , a large width .",
    "thus , while the neglect of the imaginary part of the self - energy may be justified in descriptions of the nucleon , it is certainly not justified in descriptions of the antinucleon .",
    "accordingly , it is important when using such an overly simple description to ensure that calculated quantities do not depend strongly on contributions coming from the antinucleons .",
    "one might imagine that , given the large self - energies predicted in relativistic models , one could find clear experimental signatures .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the _ individual _ self - energies are not directly observed in nuclei ; only combinations of scalar and vector appear .",
    "moreover , given the large cancellations between scalar and vector in many observables , one finds that the best evidence of a modified relativistic effective mass @xmath213 , for example , is rather indirect , coming from fits to spin observables in intermediate - energy scattering .",
    "qcd sum rules , however , are not able to predict directly such spin observables . as a result , in our qcd sum - rule studies , we adopt an indirect approach . instead of attempting to make direct predictions of experimental observables , we will use qcd sum rules to predict the individual scalar and vector self - energies themselves . to do so",
    ", we consider the analytic structure of something like the nucleon propagator in qhd models .",
    "this leads us to the natural analog in qcd of the qhd propagator : a correlator of interpolating fields with nucleon quantum numbers .",
    "our aim is to study the qcd correlator at finite density . in many ways",
    "the problem resembles the simple qhd problem discussed in this section . for example , we can exploit the fact that the correlator can be decomposed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gofq ] ) .",
    "we will also use the lehmann representation to relate the discontinuities in @xmath199 across the real axis to the spectral densities , which , in turn , determine the correlator everywhere in the complex @xmath199 plane .",
    "phenomenologically , we will assume a quasinucleon model to describe the region of the cut corresponding to the energy of a nucleon in nuclear matter .",
    "that is , we will take eq .",
    "( [ eq : mftprop ] ) as our ansatz for the quasinucleon contribution to the correlator , although we will allow the self - energies to depend on the three - momentum @xmath219 .",
    "we stress that all of this can be done without making the assumptions that qhd and the mean - field approximation are valid .",
    "all we assume is that the nucleon in medium is well approximated as a reasonably well - defined quasiparticle .",
    "lorentz covariance and the assumed invariance of the nuclear matter ground state under time - reversal and parity symmetries constrain the form of the spectral functions for the nucleon propagator in qhd models .",
    "in particular , they imply that only lorentz scalar and vector self - energies ( _ i.e. _ , no pseudoscalar or tensor components ) are associated with a quasiparticle pole @xcite .",
    "these same constraints also apply to the qcd correlator of nucleon interpolating fields .",
    "they _ do not _ involve further assumptions about hadronic degrees of freedom or other aspects of relativistic phenomenology .",
    "therefore , the principal issue we address here is not whether there are scalar and vector self - energies that characterize the nucleon - like excitation in medium ; this is a given once we believe that a quasiparticle approximation is reasonable .",
    "the real question is : what are the magnitudes , signs , and density dependencies of the self - energies ?",
    "phenomenologically , the quasiparticle energy of a nucleon in nuclear matter is only fractionally shifted from the free nucleon energy , and the excitation is only tens of mev wide at most .",
    "this small shift will not be a built - in constraint , but should be predicted by the sum rules as well .",
    "of course the quasiparticle ansatz is overly simple : the true qcd correlator at finite density will not have simple poles on the real axis .",
    "however , we believe the width of the positive - energy quasinucleon excitation to be small on hadronic scales ( and also compared to the energy over which we average in the sum rule ) , so we are justified in making a pole ansatz . moreover , since this ansatz does not explicitly include a background or continuum at these energies , the effective self - energies we extract will account for _ all _ of the strength in the nuclear domain . in this sense",
    "our in - medium nucleon `` pole '' is like the @xmath21-meson `` pole '' in the vacuum sum - rules ; it summarizes spectral strength over a narrow region . on the other hand , the spectral density on the negative - energy side , which corresponds to an antinucleon `` pole",
    ", '' describes the spectral function quite badly ; we expect a broad distribution as the density of the nuclear system is increased .",
    "therefore , we will minimize our sensitivity to this part of the spectral density by constructing a sum rule that suppresses this contribution relative to the positive - energy side .",
    "perhaps the most compelling evidence that light - quark hadron properties are significantly altered in matter stems from two basic facts : 1 ) the chiral condensate @xmath237 plays an essential role in the structure of these hadrons , and 2 ) in the nuclear medium , the magnitude of the chiral condensate is substantially reduced relative to its vacuum value .",
    "this decrease of the chiral condensate in medium is often referred to as `` partial restoration of chiral symmetry . '' in this section , we will review some of the important issues concerning the chiral condensate at finite density .",
    "additional details may be found in the recent review by birse @xcite .    to leading order ,",

    "reliably_. it is encouraging , however , to note that all of the models on the market , whether based on explicit quark degrees of freedom or hadronic degrees of freedom , give small corrections to the model - independent relation at least up to nuclear matter saturation density @xcite .",

    "this question was raised by ericson @xcite in the following context : the chiral condensate is a spatially averaged quantity . in any realistic description of nuclear matter",
    "there are spatial correlations in the local value of @xmath4 ; one might expect that inside nucleons and in their immediate neighborhood the condensate is very different from its vacuum value , while between nucleons the value of @xmath4 may not be much altered from the vacuum value . given this picture ,",

    "as noted by birse @xcite , however , this picture is not realistic : the range of the spatial correlations for @xmath4 is fairly long ; it is typically given by two - pion exchange .",

    "however , as noted in the introduction , qcd sum rules are not well suited for calculating such quantities because of delicate cancellations .    in a recent letter @xcite ,",
    "kondo and morimatsu advocate the calculation of nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths using qcd sum - rule methods . at the same time , they argue that the calculations we have described in this review are ill - founded .",
    "we disagree strongly with both aspects of their discussion .",
    "the essential criticism is given in refs .",
    "@xcite ; here we just summarize the main points .",
    "the first problem is that the qcd sum - rule approach is not appropriate for the calculation of @xmath192 scattering lengths .",
    "the large magnitudes of the empirical @xmath192 scattering lengths reflect the slightly and nearly bound states in the two scattering channels .",
    "it is well known from conventional nuclear physics that making very small changes in the strength of an assumed @xmath192 potential can make calculated scattering lengths arbitrarily large or change their signs .",
    "sum rules can not hope to address the fine details of this physics , which is determined at relatively large distances or times .    despite this ,",
    "the sum - rule calculations of kondo and morimatsu appear to predict scattering lengths qualitatively similar to the experimental data .",
    "however , their sum rules suffer from a subtle flaw that has been alluded to earlier in this review .",
    "their predictions are acutely sensitive to asymmetries in the spectral density between positive- and negative - energy states .",
    "they neglected to account for this asymmetry in the effective continuum thresholds in their analysis , and this led to spurious results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "if one accounts properly for these asymmetries in their approach , one finds results consistent with ours @xcite .",
    "large and canceling lorentz scalar and vector self - energies for the in - medium nucleon , which are predicted by relativistic phenomenology , are made plausible by the nucleon sum - rule results . yet , as we have stressed , these results are also inconclusive at present ; thus it is important to test the sum - rule framework against finite - density phenomenology and experiment in other contexts . in this section ,",
    "we discuss finite - density qcd sum rules for the self - energies of @xmath571 and @xmath196 hyperons in nuclear matter .    in hypernuclei , hyperons can occupy the lowest ( innermost ) shell - model orbits in a nucleus , which should allow reasonable comparisons to theoretical predictions for hyperons in uniform nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , various investigators have extended relativistic phenomenology to the study of hypernuclear physics @xcite . in these relativistic models , the hyperon propagating in the nuclear medium is described by a dirac equation with scalar and vector potentials .",
    "the potential depths result from the coupling of the hyperons to the same scalar and vector fields as the nucleon , but with different coupling strengths ; however , these coupling strengths are not well determined . by solving the dirac equation , one can obtain the binding energies and spin - orbit splittings for different states in hypernuclei , which can be confronted with experimental data .",
    "one of the compelling successes of relativistic models in describing nucleon - nucleus interactions is the naturally large spin - orbit force for nucleons in a finite nucleus .",
    "this force depends on the derivatives of the scalar and vector optical potentials , which add constructively .",
    "an analogous prediction for the @xmath571 hyperon would seem to be problematic , if one adopts the _ naive _ quark - model prediction that each coupling for the @xmath571 should be @xmath572 the coupling for the nucleon @xcite .",
    "[ that is , if one assumes that the scalar ( @xmath238 ) and vector ( @xmath120 ) mesons couple exclusively to the up and down ( constituent ) quarks and not to the strange quark . ] in the @xmath571-nucleus system , recent experiments indicate that the spin - orbit force is small , and even consistent with zero @xcite .",
    "this has raised questions about the validity of relativistic nuclear phenomenology for hyperons",
    ".    an early work @xcite achieved a small spin - orbit force by taking the potentials ( _ i.e. _ , the couplings ) for the @xmath571 to be a factor of three smaller than for the nucleon .",
    "more recently , however , it has been suggested that scalar and vector coupling strengths consistent with the naive quark - model predictions can be used if a tensor coupling between hyperons and the vector meson ( @xmath120 ) @xcite , motivated from a quark - model picture @xcite , is introduced . in this picture , the tensor couplings of the hyperons ( @xmath571 , @xmath196 , @xmath573 ) to the vector meson differ in their magnitudes and signs , and hence their contributions to the spin - orbit force are different .",
    "( this picture yields a negligible tensor coupling for the nucleon . ) for the @xmath571 , this picture leads to a tensor coupling with strength equal in magnitude to the corresponding vector coupling , but with the opposite sign .",
    "the net result , in combination with the scalar contribution , is a small spin - orbit force .",
    "a recent global fit to hypernuclear data favors smaller couplings ( from 0.3 to 0.5 times the nucleon - meson couplings , depending on details @xcite ) , but does not include this new tensor coupling .",
    "while experimental evidence of @xmath196 hypernuclei is lacking at present , a number of authors have extended the relativistic phenomenology to @xmath196 hypernuclei and presented theoretical predictions @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the naive quark - model prediction for the coupling strengths of the @xmath196 to the scalar and vector mesons was adopted ( the vector coupling for the @xmath196 is @xmath574 the coupling for the nucleon , and the scalar coupling for the @xmath196 is slightly smaller than @xmath574 the coupling for the nucleon ) ; in addition , the tensor coupling between the @xmath196 and the vector meson was included . in the quark - model picture of ref .",
    "@xcite , the tensor coupling of the @xmath196 to @xmath120 has the _ same _ sign as the corresponding vector coupling , in contrast to the @xmath571 case . with the quark - model values for the tensor coupling , the spin - orbit force for the @xmath196",

    "@xcite , the tensor coupling was omitted and universal couplings were assumed for _ all _ hyperons ; the ratio of the @xmath196 to @xmath571 spin - orbit force obtained is about @xmath575 .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that in refs .",
    "@xcite , scalar and vector couplings consistent with the naive quark - model predictions have been adopted , and it is the extra tensor coupling of the hyperons to the vector meson that reduces the @xmath571 spin - orbit force and enhances the @xmath196 spin - orbit force .",

    "we also note that the sum - rule predictions do not agree with the universal coupling assumption ( _ i.e. _ , all hyperons couple to the scalar and vector fields with the same strength ) suggested in ref .",
    "this review has primarily stressed the problem of baryons  nucleons and hyperons  propagating in nuclear matter . in this section , we will briefly consider a different problem , namely the propagation of vector mesons in the nuclear medium .",
    "much of the sum - rule machinery carries over directly from our previous discussion ; further details can be found in the cited literature .",
    "the possibility that the properties of vector mesons might change significantly with increasing density is of considerable current theoretical interest .",
    "for example , brown and rho @xcite have proposed a scenario in which the vector - meson masses in the medium decrease .",
    "experimentally , the question of how vector mesons behave at finite density is an open question .",
    "if the masses decrease , then one effect should be an increased range of propagation , so that the effective size of the nucleons as `` seen '' in hadron reactions mediated by vector mesons will increase .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to isolate the meson - mass effect of `` swollen '' nucleons due to decreased vector - meson masses from other physics arising from nuclear many - body effects or the substructure of the hadrons . given this generic difficulty , attempts to extract the meson - mass effect are fraught with ambiguity .",
    "various pieces of experimental evidence have been proposed in support of the picture of decreasing meson masses .",
    "one example is the quenching of the longitudinal response ( relative to the transverse response ) in quasielastic electron scattering @xcite and @xmath629 @xcite reactions , which might reflect `` swollen '' nucleons @xcite in the medium . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , this swollen - nucleon picture emerges naturally if the electromagnetic current couples to the nucleons through the vector meson ( at least partly ) and if the vector - meson mass in medium drops .",
    "a second example is the discrepancy between the total cross section in @xmath7-nucleus scattering on @xmath630c and that predicted from an impulse approximation calculation using @xmath7-nucleon scattering amplitudes ( extracted from @xmath7-d elastic scattering ) .",
    "the discrepancy is removed @xcite if there is an effective increase in the nucleon s in - medium cross section due to a decrease in the mass of the @xmath21 meson mediating the interaction .",
    "more direct investigations of vector - meson masses in the nuclear medium have also been proposed .",
    "one proposal is to study dileptons as a probe of vector mesons in the dense and hot matter formed during heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the dilepton mass spectra should allow one to reconstruct the mass of vector mesons decaying electromagnetically .",
    "a potentially cleaner probe ( less leptonic background ) would be via virtual compton scattering  the ( @xmath631 ) reaction @xcite .",
    "there are a number of potential difficulties with these probes .",
    "one concerns the lifetimes of the vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath120 and @xmath632 mesons are rather long - lived ; thus , there is a large probability that , regardless of where they are created , they will decay _ outside _ the region in which the matter is dense .",
    "this raises the question of whether these decays will provide useful information about the dense matter region .",
    "a second difficulty is that , in the nuclear medium , the position of the pole ( assuming pole dominance ) is not a function of the four - momentum @xmath79 only ; it can also depend explicitly on the three - momentum @xmath219 .",
    "thus , studies of the invariant mass of the dileptons may not be sufficient to pick out cleanly the effects of mass shifts .",
    "finally , there is no reason to suppose that the longitudinal and transverse components behave in the same way  indeed one expects them to be different , and their difference may complicate attempts to extract the masses from data .",
    "the study of vector mesons in the nuclear medium via qcd sum rules offers a theoretical complement to these experimental efforts .",
    "the pioneering studies at finite density were by hatsuda and lee @xcite , and there have been subsequent calculations by asakawa and ko @xcite .",
    "the treatment is quite similar to the treatment of the baryons discussed in previous sections of this review .",
    "here we will only sketch the analysis , with an emphasis on the differences between the baryon and vector - meson cases .",
    "our notation will not follow the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite precisely ; instead we introduce a more general form for the correlator that allows for calculations away from the @xmath633 point .",
    "the interpolating fields used for these studies and for the studies of vector mesons in the vacuum @xcite are the conserved vector currents of qcd : @xmath634 the correlator is defined as @xmath635 where @xmath260 is the nuclear matter ground state , @xmath59 is the covariant time - ordering operator @xcite , and @xmath636 represents any of the three vector currents .",
    "to proceed , it is necessary to identify the various tensor structures that can appear in this problem .",
    "a simplification is that each of these currents is exactly conserved : @xmath637 .",
    "the covariant time - ordered product is defined such that @xcite @xmath638 this constraint plus the fact that there are two four - vectors , @xmath200 and @xmath202 , from which to construct tensor structures allows us to deduce that there are two independent tensor structures : @xmath639\\ , \\label{vecform}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath640 .",

    ", one can derive sum rules for @xmath641 and @xmath642 , or any linear combination of the two . in practice ,",
    "all calculations done to date have been with @xmath633 ( in the rest frame of the matter ) ; as @xmath647 the longitudinal and transverse polarizations become degenerate , since there is no way to distinguish longitudinal from transverse . the issue of whether sum rules for certain combinations of invariant functions",
    "are more effective than others will arise , however , as soon as calculations away from @xmath633 are attempted .    in the baryon case",
    ", we noted that the correlation function , considered in the rest frame as a function of @xmath199 , has both even and odd parts .",
    "the reason is that , at finite baryon density , a baryon in medium propagates differently than an antibaryon , yielding a correlation function that is asymmetric in the energy variable .",
    "in contrast , for the correlators in the vector channels , both time orderings correspond to the creation of the vector meson , which is its own antiparticle .",
    "accordingly , the spectral function is necessarily an even function of energy , and one can write the dispersion relation as an integral over the energy squared",
    ". mesons , however , @xmath648 is the antiparticle of @xmath649 . in an isoscalar medium",
    ", they are degenerate and the spectral function is even . if , however , one considers a medium with a net isospin density ( such as neutron matter )",
    ", they cease to be degenerate and the spectral function is no longer even .",

    "having decided to fix @xmath633 , the calculation goes forward in the standard way .",
    "one starts with a dispersion relation @xmath652 in general we would need to make a subtraction , but as usual we convert to a more effective weighting function in the integral by applying a borel transform .",
    "the result is : @xmath653 in the nucleon case , we had to isolate the nucleon contribution from the antinucleon contribution , which led us to an asymmetric weighting function designed to minimize this contamination ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bsr ] ) . in the present case ,",
    "this issue does not arise and we can use the borel weighting identical to the vacuum case . to proceed , one follows the same steps described for baryon sum rules :    1 .",

    "we focus here on some issues raised in these sum rules and refer the reader to the literature @xcite for specific details of the actual calculations and results ( including results for the @xmath632 meson ) .",
    "the calculation of the wilson coefficients involves no new subtleties ; the coefficients can be calculated using the techniques outlined in sec .",
    "[ wilson : coe ] . since finite - density condensates",
    "are properties of the medium and not the probe , the same condensates estimated earlier for baryon sum rules enter here .",
    "the reader should be reminded that these estimates are rather crude .",
    "typically we only estimate these condensates by folding nuclear matrix elements with the nuclear density .",
    "while this may be adequate for normal nuclear matter density , it is likely to be problematic at high densities ( _ e.g. _ , 23 times normal nuclear density ) .",
    "this should be kept in mind in the context of heavy - ion collisions , which produce such high densities .",
    "the appropriate nuclear matrix elements come from a variety of sources , and , in some cases , modeling is necessary .    in the case of the nucleon",
    ", we found that the sum - rule predictions were extremely sensitive to the value of certain dimension - six four - quark condensates .",
    "the hypothesis of ground - state saturation led to results in strong contradiction with experiment ; furthermore , the theoretical prejudices in favor of the hypothesis are not strongly founded .",
    "this issue is also extremely important in the context of the vector - meson sum rules . in the vacuum sum rule for the vector mesons ,",
    "four - quark condensates provide the dominant correction to the perturbative term in the ope .",
    "( note , however , that these are not the same four - quark condensates as in the nucleon case . ) in the finite - density sum rules , the density dependences of these condensates largely determine the predicted density dependence of the vector - meson mass .",
    "since all in - medium vector - meson calculations to date assume factorization , we must interpret the results with caution .    to implement the sum rule ,",
    "one needs a model for the spectral function . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following ansatz is adopted : @xmath654 with @xmath655 for the @xmath21 and @xmath120 mesons , and @xmath656 for the @xmath632 meson .",
    "the effective mass @xmath657 corresponds to the position of the propagator pole .",
    "the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ rhoansatz ] ) represent a pole - plus - continuum ansatz , exactly as in the vacuum sum rules .",
    "the first term is a scattering term , which corresponds to landau damping .",
    "the form of this scattering term requires some explanation . for a nonzero three - momentum @xmath219 , the imaginary part of the correlator",
    "has support in the _ spacelike _ region ( @xmath658 ) .",
    "indeed , in electron scattering these spacelike excitations are all that one can probe . for the propagation of modes , these spacelike excitations act as damping terms . in general ,",
    "the analytic structure of the correlator in the @xmath120 plane corresponding to these spacelike excitations is a cut .",
    "however , as @xmath647 , this cut gets squeezed to the @xmath659 point and reduces to a delta function in the imaginary part .",
    "a detailed description of the scattering term can be found in ref .",
    "in practice , the contribution from this term is quite small for the in - medium vector meson sum rules @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ rhoansatz ] ) is justified at finite density .",
    "a central question is whether there are regions of large spectral density away from the meson pole .",
    "one possible source for the @xmath21-meson channel is from @xmath241-@xmath566-hole states . in model calculations @xcite ,",
    "these give rise to significant spectral strength well isolated from the @xmath21 pole . if there is a large low-@xmath660 contribution from the @xmath241-@xmath566-hole physics that is not included in the model for the spectral density , the fitted mass for the @xmath21 pole will be significantly lower than the actual mass .",
    "the calculation of asakawa and ko @xcite attempts to include the @xmath241-@xmath566-hole contributions .",
    "the results of their sum - rule calculations are quite insensitive to the effects of the @xmath241-@xmath566-hole contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral densities extracted by asakawa and ko are quite different from those of the model calculations @xcite .    in the end ,",
    "hatsuda and lee find a substantial reduction in the @xmath21 and @xmath120 masses in medium . for low densities , they find @xcite @xmath661 the decreasing mass arises primarily due to the density dependence of the four - quark condensates and @xmath460 .",
    "asakawa and ko find a somewhat stronger density dependence for the @xmath21 meson , with its mass reduced to about 530 mev at nuclear matter density .",
    "these results are consistent with the hypothesis of decreasing vector meson masses in the nuclear medium , although the reader should keep in mind the many caveats we have cited . in particular",
    ", we are concerned about the applicability of a quasiparticle - pole ansatz and the use of factorized four - quark condensates .",
    "future work should consider the density dependence of the coupling constant and the momentum dependence of the longitudinal and transverse effective masses .",
    "the qcd sum - rule approach to hadronic properties is now rather mature . the seminal work of shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov is more than 15 years old and has spawned an entire industry  the original paper @xcite has more than 1400 citations .",
    "sum - rule methods have produced phenomenological successes for a wide range of problems , some far beyond the original application of meson masses and couplings .",
    "the current state of affairs is summarized in the review / reprint volume edited by shifman @xcite .    despite the popularity and apparent success of qcd sum rules ,",
    "there remain concerns about the validity of various aspects of the approach .",
    "many of these issues are addressed in ref .",
    "here we briefly review some of the questions that carry over in particular to the problem of hadrons in medium .",
    "one central issue is the predictive power of the approach for low - energy hadronic observables .",
    "while the ope may predict with reasonable accuracy certain weighted integrals over physical spectral densities , this is insufficient to make solid predictions for properties of stable particles or resonances .",
    "qcd sum rules require nontrivial knowledge of the spectral density , which is used to formulate a spectral ansatz .",
    "that is , in order for the sum rules to be predictive , one must already know something about the spectral functions ",
    "one can not make pure _ a priori _ predictions .",
    "this point should be kept in mind when discussing sum rules for hadrons in medium ; one s knowledge about the form of spectral densities for this problem is certainly less than for the vacuum case .",
    "if assumptions about the finite - density spectral density are qualitatively wrong , then the sum rule may produce highly misleading results .",
    "it is accordingly very important to have the best possible model for the phenomenological side .",
    "a second issue at the core of the approach is the validity of the ope _ as actually implemented in qcd sum - rule calculations_. it has been argued @xcite that there is _ always _ an ope that separates long - distance physics ( summarized in condensates ) from short - distance physics in wilson coefficients .",
    "the question that must be addressed is the extent to which the wilson coefficients may be calculated via low - order perturbation theory .",
    "shifman argues @xcite that the success of the qcd sum - rule approach phenomenologically justifies the `` put all nonperturbative contributions into the condensates and calculate the wilson coefficients perturbatively '' approach for most cases .",
    "there are cases in which this approach seems to fail , such as for glueball channels .",
    "others have called it into question for the nucleon channel .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that direct - instanton effects in the wilson coefficients may play an important role in stabilizing the nucleon sum rule .",
    "these nonperturbative direct - instanton effects can occur , since instantons may be smaller than the separation scale used in the ope , and will still play a nonperturbative role . in general the role of instantons in the ope remains an open question .",
    "our assumption has been that perturbation theory is sufficient to calculate the wilson coefficients with acceptable accuracy .",
    "a third issue is the estimation of condensates . to the extent that the sum rules are only sensitive to a few low - dimensional condensates , it is probably reasonable to assume that the important condensates can be determined with sufficient accuracy by fitting to a number of different channels .",
    "so long as there are fewer important condensates then there are observables , one will be able to deduce their values from some set of observables and still have predictive power for other observables .    a central question , however , is the validity of the vacuum - saturation or factorization hypothesis for the four - quark condensates , which play an essential role in sum rules for light - quark hadrons .",
    "the importance of these condensates despite their relatively high dimension ( six ) is simply understood  the wilson coefficients associated with these condensates are anomalously large , because they do not have the small numerical factors associated with loop integrals @xcite .    in the original work of svz @xcite , a duality argument was given in favor of the vacuum - saturation hypothesis .",
    "subsequently a large-@xmath423 argument was also advanced @xcite .",
    "in our view , neither argument is especially compelling .",
    "the large-@xmath423 argument can be questioned since higher - order terms in the @xmath662 expansion are not necessarily negligible given the fact that @xmath423 is only three .",
    "the duality argument was based on saturating @xmath663 with both two - pion states and the vacuum : @xmath664 if one assumes that the two - pion intermediate states are _ free _ noninteracting pions , then one can show using pcac - type arguments that the contribution from the pions is much smaller than the vacuum term unless one sums up to very large relative pion energies @xmath665gev . if the sum were cut off by other physics at a more moderate scale ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath21-meson mass ) , then the two - pion contribution is small .",
    "however , the two - pion states need not dominate the correction to the vacuum - saturation contribution : multiple pion states can contribute .",
    "moreover , the assumption that the two - pion states behave as free pions is only valid right at threshold .",
    "apart from these two arguments , the only real justification for the factorization hypothesis is _",
    "a posteriori_. namely , it seems to work phenomenologically in the context of qcd sum rules .",
    "for example , shifman @xcite writes that for most channels the phenomenology is consistent with deviations from factorization at only the 10% level or less .    as we have noted , the values of the dimension - six four - quark condensates are the most significant uncertainties in qcd sum - rule treatments of hadrons in nuclear matter",
    ". the most naive generalization of vacuum saturation to this problem is ground - state saturation .",
    "we can argue based on phenomenological concerns that it is _ not _ a good approximation at nuclear matter densities .",
    "in this context it is worth noting that none of the three arguments in favor of vacuum saturation  duality , large @xmath423 , and phenomenology  give much support to the ground - state saturation hypothesis at finite density .",
    "results given earlier imply that phenomenology is inconsistent with ground - state saturation , at least so far as the nucleon sum rules are concerned .",
    "while neither the duality nor large-@xmath423 arguments are compelling for the vacuum case , for the case of finite density matter they are even weaker .",
    "the duality argument was based on the contribution of two - pion states . at finite densities , however , in addition to two - pion states there are very many low - lying particle - hole type states in the system .",
    "thus , it is by no means clear that the ground state will dominate over contributions from these new states . with regard to the large-@xmath423 argument",
    ", it should be noted that the @xmath662 expansion alone is known to be unreliable for estimating the relative sizes of nuclear matter observables .",
    "for example , a large-@xmath423 analysis gives the kinetic energy of nucleons in nuclear matter as being @xmath666 , while the potential energy is @xmath667 .",
    "in realistic nuclei at nuclear matter densities , the two quantities are , in fact , of similar magnitudes @xcite .",
    "a final problem to consider is that our results may to some degree be artifacts of the interpolating fields chosen for the analysis .",
    "there is always this danger when predictions are not independent of the interpolating fields , even though there are compelling arguments why one choice of field is superior to another .",
    "this sort of question is best answered by numerical simulations . unlike the case of the vacuum ,",
    "the prospects for useful numerical simulations of nuclear observables is quite unclear .",
    "one can hope , however , for some future lattice calculations that will test the basic ideas of scalar and vector physics that we have explored with sum rules and provide some definite insight into the density dependence of the four - quark condensates .      as emphasized above , in order for sum rules to be useful in practice",
    ", one must be able to make a simple parameterization of the spectral function .",
    "typically , for vacuum sum rules , one uses a pole plus continuum ansatz , where the continuum is modeled as the perturbative spectral density ( plus ope contributions ) starting at a sharp threshold .",
    "clearly , such a parameterization is a major simplification of a complicated spectrum .",
    "the important question is whether this simplification leads to significant uncertainties in the application of qcd sum rules .",
    "while there have not been direct tests of the continuum model based on the borel - transformed correlator , there have been tests of a lattice analog  the correlator as a function of imaginary time . at three - momentum @xmath633 ( achieved by summing uniformly over spatial directions ) , the correlator at euclidean time @xmath668 can be written as",
    "is small , only small @xmath669 is probed , so a short - distance ope is appropriate in this regime . ]",
    "@xmath670 where @xmath21 is the spectral density .",
    "this lattice correlator simply corresponds to a weighted integral of the spectral density with a different weighting function than in the borel transform .",
    "like the borel transform , this weighting suppresses the high - energy states and improves convergence of the ope @xcite .",
    "( note , however , that the suppression is greater with borel weighting . )",
    "we also observe natural association of short times with a broad smearing of the spectral function .",
    "recently , leinweber has tested the simple spectral ansatz in fits to lattice data of the nucleon correlator @xcite .",
    "he found that the pole - plus - continuum model did a good job of describing the correlator over a surprisingly large range of @xmath668 , including most of the intermediate range between the perturbative regime and the large-@xmath668 regime . only the latter regime is dominated by the nucleon pole .",
    "moreover , fits to the nucleon mass based on the ansatz in the intermediate-@xmath668 range gave remarkable agreement with the nucleon mass extracted from the correlator evaluated at large times .",
    "this test supports the pole - plus - continuum ansatz commonly used in sum - rule applications .",
    "some caveats should be made concerning this test @xcite : the lattice calculations were done in the quenched approximation , required a sizable extrapolation in quark mass @xmath46 , and were confined to distances somewhat larger than those used in qcd sum - rule fits .",
    "we hope similar calculations without these limitations will be made eventually .",
    "while lattice calculations suggest that the simple pole - plus - continuum model works well in ( or at least near ) the regime of interest , there are concerns on the horizon .",
    "recently it was pointed out @xcite that one can use the known behavior of various quantities with changes in the quark mass ( in the small quark - mass limit ) to test the consistency of the pole - plus - continuum ansatz .",
    "when studying the nucleon correlator with the ope , one finds terms proportional to @xmath166 , which is known from chiral perturbation theory @xcite to behave as follows near the chiral limit : @xmath671 where @xmath672 is the value of the quark condensate in the chiral limit and @xmath673 is some mass parameter .",
    "thus , the ope side of the sum rule has a term that behaves like @xmath674 . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading nonanalytic term ( in @xmath46 or @xmath675 ) in the nucleon mass is known to be @xmath676 @xcite ; there is no @xmath674 term . to make the phenomenology consistent with the ope",
    ", the continuum must produce a term that goes as @xmath674 to exactly cancel the term in the ope .",
    "such a contribution to the continuum is not possible in a simple pole - plus - continuum model . on the other hand , it is possible to use soft - pion theorems to show that , if the continuum model includes pions , then the pion contributions automatically reproduce the chiral log seen in the ope @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the uncertainty in the nucleon mass due to the neglect of pions in the continuum model is 100 mev @xcite , the size of the contribution of the @xmath674 term with @xmath673 chosen to have a `` reasonable '' value of @xmath677gev .",
    "one of the principal motivations for using qcd sum rules to describe nucleons propagating in nuclear matter is to test the essential qualitative physics underlying dirac phenomenology .",
    "in light of this goal , some comments on the controversy about the validity of the dirac approach @xcite are appropriate .",
    "this controversy has been long running and is not considered as settled .",
    "however , we argue that the main criticism of the dirac phenomenology is not germane to the question of interest here : the magnitudes and signs of the scalar and vector parts of the optical potential .    to those who doubt the entire dirac approach , the question ultimately comes down to whether it makes sense to describe a composite particle such as the nucleon by a dirac equation @xcite .",
    "often this is expressed in terms of the role of z graphs , _",
    "i.e. _ , scattering from a positive - energy state into a negative - energy state and back .",
    "a fundamental difference between a dirac description and a schroedinger description is the possibility of these z graphs .",
    "the essence of the criticism of dirac phenomenology is that the composite nature of the nucleon suppresses z graphs and , in doing so , suppresses the relativistic effects @xcite . while one can not yet directly address this question in qcd , it is clear , in the context of toy models @xcite and large-@xmath423 qcd @xcite , that the composite nature of the nucleon does suppress the coupling to nucleon - antinucleon pairs ( relative to what one expects with pointlike dirac nucleons ) .",
    "what these simple models show is the unsurprising fact that a composite nucleon will not behave the same way as a dirac nucleon .",
    "on the basis of this result one may be tempted to throw out dirac phenomenology , which is , after all , based on the dirac equation .    however , this observation is completely beside the point .",
    "the key question is the nature of nucleon propagation : what are the on - shell self - energies or optical potentials ?",
    "suppose we wish to describe proton - nucleus scattering with an optical potential .",
    "to do so , one must suppress explicit reference to both the excitations of the nucleus and the internal excitations of the nucleon ( which is a necessary consequence of the nucleon s composite structure ) .",
    "the cost of suppressing explicit references to these degrees of freedom is that we get complex and energy - dependent potentials .",
    "now suppose that one wishes to describe the nucleon scattering problem covariantly as well .",
    "the result will be a dirac optical potential .",
    "while we do not know how to calculate the optical potential from first principles , we can use general symmetry considerations to deduce its lorentz structure .",
    "we learn that such an optical potential has both scalar and vector pieces .",
    "it is ultimately an empirical question whether the scalar and vector potentials are separately large or small",
    ".    how can one reconcile large scalar optical potentials ( and hence large z - graph contributions ) in the optical - model description with the fact that compositeness suppresses the amplitude to create @xmath678 pairs ?",
    "the simple answer is that there is nothing to reconcile ; they are completely different things .",
    "the z graphs in the optical potential need not be associated with virtual @xmath679 pairs .",
    "the intuitive connection between z graphs and virtual @xmath678 pairs is the hole picture of dirac .",
    "while this is certainly a useful picture for free or weakly interacting point fermions , for strongly interacting or highly composite fermions , there is no necessary connection .",
    "recently , wallace , gross , and tjon @xcite constructed a solvable toy model of a composite comprised of a fermion - boson bound state . in this model",
    ", one sees explicitly how , in a complete treatment of the composite in an external field , virtual composite - anticomposite pairs are suppressed ( relative to what would be expected from a point dirac fermion ) . at the same time , they show how a description of the same physics without explicit reference to compositeness requires large z - graph contributions at the level of the effective theory .",
    "the point here is that the effects of z graphs in the effective theory ( without explicit reference to the internal structure ) does _ not _ correspond to contributions from virtual pairs of composite particles and antiparticles .    to reiterate our perspective on this issue : the essential physics underlying the success of dirac phenomenology is the large and canceling scalar and vector parts of the optical potential ( self - energy ) .",
    "questions concerning the role of virtual @xmath678 states or the validity of the dirac equation for composite particles , while interesting in their own right , are not relevant in this context .",
    "the extension of qcd sum - rule techniques to finite density can provide a bridge between nuclear phenomenology and the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "however , when making connections to qcd , one must recognize that most familiar nuclear observables are associated with energy scales much smaller than those of hadronic observables .",
    "furthermore , many or most nuclear _ experimental _ observables are the result of fine cancellations .",
    "qcd sum rules , which extrapolate from short times with limited resolution , can not be used to resolve small energy differences or to predict physics that is determined at long times or distances .",
    "therefore one should not be too ambitious in applying sum - rule techniques at finite density .",
    "detailed experimental predictions of conventional nuclear observables are more appropriately studied in the context of effective models of qcd . in this class",
    "we would include attempts to understand nuclear matter saturation or nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths quantitatively ( although _ qualitative _ insight might be possible ) .",
    "the alternative that we have proposed is to focus on phenomenology that is associated with energy scales more conducive to a sum - rule treatment .",
    "the most solid result to date connected with finite - density qcd sum rules is the behavior of the chiral condensate with density .",
    "the model - independent result [ eq .",
    "( [ qbar - im ] ) ] , which predicts the linear density dependence of the condensate , appears to be robust , at least up to nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "although there are still sizable uncertainties in the value of the nucleon @xmath238 term , it is known well enough to imply a very substantial change ( 3040% reduction ) in the chiral condensate inside of nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the change with density has been convincingly related to two - pion exchange physics @xcite , which provides a natural connection to the scalar meson of meson - exchange phenomenology and establishes that the range is sufficiently large that short - range correlations should not cause drastic changes .",
    "the latter point is very important ; if correlations dominated the physics , then the value of the _ average _ condensate would not be very relevant .    given a large change in @xmath680 , one might anticipate compensating changes in the hadronic spectrum .",
    "qcd sum rules offer a direct way to make a connection between such qcd ground - state properties and properties of observed states . here",
    "we have used the sum rules to associate @xmath680 with the change in the scalar self - energy of a quasinucleon .",
    "similarly , changes in the vector self - energy ( of opposite sign ) are primary associated with the vector density @xmath441 . assuming the density dependence of the four - quark condensates to be weak , the resulting self - energies are in qualitative agreement with relativistic phenomenology .",
    "a disclaimer that must be made is that in another context , sum rules for nucleons at finite temperature , changes in the quark condensate have been _ mistakenly _ identified with a shift in the nucleon mass .",
    "the critical point is that one must adequately model the phenomenological spectral density ; if not , changes that show up as new features in the spectral density , could be attributed instead to a shift in the mass by the fitting procedure .",
    "we know of no analogous problems with our analysis of baryons in nuclear matter .",
    "while the spectral ansatz is quite simple and could , in principle , be missing important features , it is consistent with successful nuclear phenomenology .",
    "many qcd sum - rule results we have cited are rather indefinite ( at least at present ) .",
    "however , the nature of the sum - rule approach should be taken into account when accessing the value of its predictions .",
    "as in the zero - density case , it is not the quantitative predictions for hadron masses and other properties that are most important .",
    "indeed , lattice calculations will ultimately provide far more precise determinations of the hadronic spectrum .",
    "it is the quantitative relations and qualitative insight that are most valuable , and which will persist to challenge any numerical or model predictions .",
    "it has been said ( about vacuum sum rules ) that qcd sum rules only work well when making `` postdictions '' rather than predictions .",
    "this is true to some extent , although there are also notable exceptions .",
    "more precisely , one can say that the reliability of sum - rule applications , particularly when applied to new observables and in new domains , is not guaranteed without some feedback from experiment .",
    "the problem is that subtleties can be missed !",
    "one should not , at the same time , underestimate the usefulness of postdictions .",
    "after all , the data _ is _ measured experimentally .",
    "what we seek is _ understanding _ of how it fits into a larger picture .",
    "this is what the sum rules can provide .",
    "for example , one might ask whether the decomposition into scalar and vector pieces made in relativistic phenomenology is merely an artificial construction .",
    "the sum - rule results tell us there is a reason to pay attention to these pieces separately : the physics is different ! specifically , the scalar self - energy is predominantly associated with changes in the scalar condensate , which is in turn related to chiral symmetry restoration . on the other hand ,",
    "the vector self - energy is largely determined by the vector condensate , or quark density , which is not dynamical .",
    "the ultimate stumbling block to drawing solid quantitative conclusions from the finite - density sum rules is the density dependence of the four - quark condensates .",
    "we have repeatedly emphasized the importance of matrix elements of four - quark field operators in qcd sum rules for light - quark hadrons .",
    "this is true at zero density , finite density , and finite temperature . in the vacuum",
    ", the factorization hypothesis plays an important role in reducing the inputs to the sum rules to a small number of phenomenological parameters .",
    "the validity of factorization at zero density seems to be dependent on the particular four - quark condensate and seems quite reasonable in some cases .",
    "however , one must remember that a factor of two uncertainty in a dimension - six condensate only propagates as a sixth root of two uncertainty in the predicted mass of a hadron .",
    "thus one only needs factorization to determine the mass scale rather crudely .",
    "in contrast , our concern is with the density dependence of hadronic properties , which requires the density dependence of condensates .",
    "factorization implies a very rapid density dependence for four - quark condensates , which has drastic and adverse effects on the nucleon sum - rule predictions . nevertheless , there are too many uncertainties associated with the finite - density sum rules to insist that our results imply that the four - quark condensates vary slowly with density .",
    "there are two obvious ways to proceed to clarify the situation , which are being pursued at present .",
    "the first is to better model the four - quark condensates @xcite .",
    "the second way is to concentrate on sum rules that do not rely on the four - quark condensates .",
    "the key here is to find new , independent sum rules for the nucleon , taking advantage of interpolating fields with both spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 parts . by considering a mixed correlator with ioffe s current and the spin-3/2spin-1/2 current , spin-1/2 intermediate states ( including the nucleon )",
    "are still projected , but one generates additional sum rules for @xmath213 that are independent of the problematic four - quark condensates @xcite .",
    "this sum - rule analysis should provide a clean test of the density dependence of @xmath519 .    finally , we comment on sum - rule predictions of changes in hadron properties under the extreme conditions of density that can be reached experimentally in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . the untangling of experimental signatures for such changes is a formidable challenge .",
    "the most promising observables appear to be vector - meson masses , which might be measured by monitoring dilepton production .",
    "there are several difficulties with the quantitative sum - rule predictions of these masses at present :    * the principal determining factor in the density dependence of masses are certain four - quark condensates . predictions to date of large changes rely , once again , on a factorization assumption . * even accepting factorization , one also needs to extrapolate the density dependence of the quark condensate far beyond ordinary nuclear densities .",
    "this extrapolation is very uncertain at this point in time since predictions from model calculations begin to diverge from each other around nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "* an essential ingredient of the sum - rule approach is a simple but complete model of the phenomenological spectral density .",
    "there is the definite possibility of missed physics ( such as new excitations and widths ) in the vector - meson channel that get translated into spurious predictions for mass shifts .",
    "one can hope that the sum - rule picture and approach will be refined as experimental data is accumulated . at present",
    ", we must conclude that extrapolations to high density based on qcd sum rules are not quantitatively reliable .",
