    "motivated by numerical observations by alexander , yorke , you and kan @xcite and sommerer and ott @xcite , the term _ intermingled basins _ was introduced to the mathematics literature by kan in @xcite : `` [  ] any open set which intersects one basin in a set of positive measure also intersects each of the other basins in a set of positive measure '' , and he showed the existence of an open set of diffeomorphisms with two intermingled basins on a three - dimensional manifold .",
    "the degree of intermingledness was soon quantified by the _ uncertainty exponent _",
    "@xcite originally introduced in @xcite . in @xcite this exponent",
    "is calculated numerically for a certain model of point particle motion subject to friction and periodic forcing in a two - dimensional potential ( which does not display intermingled but riddled basins ) , and the authors support their findings theoretically by calculations carried out for a simple piecewise linear model , that has the form of a skew product over two - leg base map with two full linear branches and for which the dynamics are essentially equivalent to that of a random walk with two regimes of transition probabilities .",
    "later , a related quantity denoted _ stability index _ was introduced in @xcite and further studied in @xcite . while the uncertainty exponent measures the degree of intermingledness averaged over points that are equidistant to one of the attractors , the stability index measures intermingledness close to individual points , so it resembles a local dimension .    in the present paper we provide rigorous derivations of the two exponents mentioned before for nonlinear generalizations of the piecewise linear system .",
    "we use thermodynamic formalism and large deviations theory for the base map in order to study a nonlinear version of the two - regime random walk .",
    "the class of systems we investigate includes examples from @xcite and also some of the maps from @xcite that serve as models of _ indeterminate competition _ in two species systems . for a particular family of such systems",
    "the numerical analyses in the spirit of @xcite was carried out in @xcite .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we introduce the class of skew product danamical systems studied in this paper and some basic concepts related to them . in section 2",
    "we recall the characterization of intermingledness through normal lyapunov exponents , define the stability index and the uncertainty exponent and state our three main theorems , whose proofs are deferred to section 3 .",
    "we study skew product dynamical systems @xmath0 , @xmath1 , defined as follows :    @xmath2 denotes the family of all skew product transformations @xmath3 on @xmath4 where    @xmath5 is a standard borel space and @xmath6 is a @xmath7-measurable transformation ,    @xmath8 is a compact interval that we choose as @xmath9 $ ] for convenience ,    the maps @xmath10 are diffeomorphisms with @xmath11 and negative schwarzian derivative @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ,    and finally we require that @xmath14 is measurable .    for the iterates @xmath15 of @xmath3 we adopt the usual notation @xmath16 .",

    "it seems that for @xmath93 the lower and upper invariant graph are uniformly attracting .",
