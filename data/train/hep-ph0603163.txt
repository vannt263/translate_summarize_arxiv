    "furthermore , although it has been argued on general grounds that quarks become deconfined at high densities , a corresponding detailed picture is missing .",
    "this relates to the fact that already at vanishing temperatures and densities many aspects of the confinement mechanisms remain elusive , in spite of recent progress ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",

    "it seems natural to suitably extend these methods to finite densities especially for the strongly coupled regime , and compare to analytical results obtained in the weak coupling limit . in the present work we proceed in this direction by extending the truncation scheme of the pertinent dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) proposed in ref .",
