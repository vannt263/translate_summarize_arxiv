    "there has been interest recently @xcite in models related to the buckley - leverett equation @xcite of two - phase porous media flow , in which a rate - dependent dispersive term is included in the capillary pressure .",
    "the buckley - leverett flux is a non - convex fractional flow rate , so that with both dissipation and dispersion , there are likely to be undercompressive shocks @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a simpler equation that has a cubic flux , and both dissipation and rate dependent dispersion , similar to the bbm ( benjamin - bona - mahoney ) equation @xcite .",
    "such equations have been termed pseudo - parabolic @xcite , and the specific equation considered we refer to as the modified bbm - burgers equation , meaning that the bbm equation ( which has a quadratic flux ) is modified here to have a cubic flux function , and the dissipation is of the simple form seen in burgers equation .    in previous work on undercompressive shocks",
    "@xcite , we characterized traveling wave solutions for the modified kdv - burgers equation with explicit formulas . here , we use a similar analysis to identify invariant parabolic curves through equilibria for the vector field whose heteroclinic orbits represent traveling waves . for the bbm - type dispersion however , the analysis leads to an implicit parameterization , but again with explicit formulas .",
    "consequently , the proof of uniqueness , while relying on a general result for the type of cubic vector field that arises here , is slightly less direct .",
    "interestingly , there is a trade - off between the existence of undercompressive traveling waves and the stability or instability of constant solutions that does not arise in the case of kdv - type dispersion .",
    "consequently the cubic nonlinearity has to be chosen carefully in order that constant solutions are stable for the pde , while preserving the existence of traveling waves approximating undercompressive shocks .",
    "we solve the riemann problem explicitly for the underlying conservation law , using traveling wave information from the full equations to determine admissible shocks .",
    "numerical simulations verify that these solutions give the structure of smooth solutions when dissipation and dispersion are included .    in section  [ sec_bbm ]",
    "we describe basic properties of the pde . in section  [ sec_tw ]",
    "we calculate invariant manifolds on which the traveling waves exist .",
    "this information is used to solve riemann problems in section  [ sec_rp ] . in section [ sec_system ]",
    "we show how a similar analysis applies to the quasilinear wave equation of one - dimensional elasticity with cubic stress - strain law including rate dependence ( viscosity ) and capillarity .",
    "in contrast to the situation for non - monotonic stress - strain laws , riemann problem solutions can not include more than one undercompressive shock .",
    "the bbm equation @xcite [ bbm1 ] u_t+uu_x+u_xxt=0 , is a variation on the kdv equation for water waves in a long -wave approximation .",
    "a similar dispersive regularization of the buckley - leverett equation of two - phase flow in porous media was introduced by gray and hassanizadeh @xcite : [ bl1 ] u_t+f(u)_x=(h(u)u_x)_x + ( h(u)u_xt)_x . in this equation",
    ", @xmath0 represents a fraction of the local pore volume occupied by of one of the two fluid phases and the flux function @xmath1 is the fractional flow rate of that fluid , derived from darcy s law .",
    "significantly , @xmath1 is non - convex .",
    "the two terms on the right hand side of equation are dissipative and dispersive , respectively , with positive parameters @xmath2 and a positive nonlinear function @xmath3 they represent the equilibrium and rate - dependent contributions of interfacial energy to capillary pressure .",
    "burgers equation [ burgers1 ] u_t+uu_x = u_xx is dissipative , and is a prototype of conservation laws regularized by viscosity @xmath4 in our analysis of undercompressive shocks for scalar equations , we consider a greatly simplified version of equation in which the dissipative and dispersive terms are linear : [ pde2 ] u_t+f(u)_x = u_xx+u_xxt , and the flux function @xmath1 is cubic .",
    "this equation has two crucial features when @xmath5 and @xmath6 first , we observe that is linearly stable at every constant @xmath7 specifically , the dispersion relation is @xmath8 thus , @xmath9 specifically , for @xmath10 we have @xmath11 for all @xmath12 however , if @xmath13 then the equation is unstable , having @xmath14 for all @xmath15    the second property we require is the presence of traveling waves with positive speed corresponding to heteroclinic orbits between saddle - point equilibria of an ode system .",
    "with @xmath10 this property leads to the choice of cubic flux function [ flux1 ] f(u)=u - u^3 .",
    "this flux function resembles the buckley - leverett flux in the interval @xmath16 in that @xmath17 is monotonically increasing , concave for @xmath18 and convex for @xmath19 equations such as , are sometimes referred to as _ pseudoparabolic _",
    "@xcite , based on properties of the dispersion relation of the equation linearized about a constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is non - negative in both and in order that the dissipative term is not destabilizing . the transformation @xmath21 changes only the sign of the flux , thereby switching both the convexity and the monotonicity , but leaving the sign of @xmath22 and @xmath23 unchanged .",
    "with this transformation , waves propagate to the left ( with negative speed ) rather than to the right .",
    "the behavior is different for kdv - type equations , where the transformation @xmath21 changes the sign of both the flux and the dispersive term , for example in the modified kdv - burgers equation @xcite , @xmath24 in summary , the equation we consider here , [ pde3 ] u_t+(u - u^3)_x = u_xx+u_xxt , is referred to in this paper as the modified bbm - burgers equation , the term _ modified _ being used because the quadratic flux of the bbm - burgers equation has been replace by a cubic .",

    "a shock for which characteristics pass through the shock necessarily fails the lax entropy condition .",
    "such shocks that are tw - admissible are called _ undercompressive . _ because the flux function @xmath40 has a single inflection point , undercompressive shocks correspond to a chord cutting the graph of @xmath41 as @xmath42 goes from @xmath30 to @xmath43 then the shock speed is necessarily greater than the characteristic speed on each side , so that characteristics pass through from ahead of the shock to behind . in the language of gas dynamics ,",
    "the shock is supersonic with respect to the sound speed both ahead of and behind the shock .    substituting ( [ tw1 ] ) into gives the third order ode ( omitting tildes ) tw1 -s u^+(u - u^3)^=u^-su^ where @xmath44 integrating and implementing the boundary condition at @xmath45 yields the second order ode tw2 -s(u - u_-)+u - u^3-(u_u_-^3)=u^-su^. it is convenient to rescale @xmath46 to eliminate the parameter @xmath47 in the final term .",
