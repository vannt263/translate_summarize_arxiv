    "in addition to 3c  48 we observed the quasars da  193 and 3c  138 for phase calibration .",
    "3c 138 was used as a fringe finder due to its high flux density of @xmath09  jy at 1.65 ghz .",
    "the amplitude of the visibility data was calibrated using the system temperatures , monitored during the observations , and gain curves of each antenna that were measured within 2 weeks of the observations .",

    "the instrumental polarization parameters of the antenna feeds ( the so - called ` d - terms ' ) were calculated from the da  193 data and then used to correct the phase of the 3c  48 data . the absolute evpa was then calibrated from observations of 3c  138 @xcite . a comparison between the apparent polarization angle of 3c  138 and the value from the vla calibrator monitoring program ( i.e. , @xmath17 at 20 cm wavelength ) leads to a differential angle @xmath18 , which was applied to correct the apparent orientation of the e - vector for the 3c  48 data .",

    "the phases of the data were corrected for the varying parallactic angles on each antenna .",
    "magnetized plasma in the ionosphere results in an additional phase difference between the right- and left - handed signals , owing to faraday rotation .",
    "this time - variable faraday rotation tends to defocus the polarized image and to give rise to erroneous estimates of the instrumental polarization parameters .",
    "we estimated the ionospheric faraday rotation on each antenna based on the model suggested in the aips cookbook , and corrected the phases of the visibilities accordingly .",
    "da  193 , oq  208 , pks  2134 + 004 and 3c  138 were used to calibrate the time- and elevation - dependent complex gains .",

    "after self - calibration , the evn and merlin data of 3c  48 were combined to make an image with intermediate resolution and high sensitivity .",
    "the pointing centre of the merlin observation was offset by 0.034 arcsec to the west and 0.378 arcsec to the north with respect to the evn pointing centre ( table [ tab : obs ] ) . before combination , we first shifted the pointing centre of the merlin data to align with that of the evn data .",
    "the lovell and cambridge telescopes took part in both the evn and merlin observations .",
    "we compared the amplitude of 3c  48 on the common lovell  cambridge baseline in the evn and merlin data , and re - scaled the evn visibilities by multiplying them by a factor of 1.4 to match the merlin flux .",
    "after combination of evn and merlin visibility data , we performed a few iterations of amplitude and phase self - calibration to eliminate the residual errors resulting from minor offsets in registering the two coordinate frames and flux scales .",

    "the final image was produced using a hybrid of the clark ( bgc clean ) and steer ( sdi clean ) deconvolution algorithms .",
    "the image shows that the source structure is characterized by two major features : a compact component contributing about half of the total flux density ( hereafter referred to as the ` compact jet ' ) , and an extended component surrounding the compact jet like a cocoon ( hereafter called the ` extended envelope ' ) .",
    "the compact jet is elongated in roughly the north - south direction , in alignment with the vlbi jet .",

    "the absence of short baselines ( @xmath24 ) results in some negative features ( the so - called ` negative bowl ' in synthesis images ) just outside the outer boundary of the envelope .    the integrated flux density over the whole source is 14.36@xmath251.02 jy ( very close to the single - dish measurement ) , suggesting that there is not much missing flux on short spacings .",
    "the uncertainty we assign includes both the systematic errors and the _ r.m.s .",
    "_ fluctuations in the image .",
    "since the calibrator of the flux density scale , 3c  286 , is resolved on baselines longer than 600 k@xmath26 @xcite , a model with a set of clean components was used in flux density calibration instead of a point - source model .",
    "we further compared the derived flux density of the phase calibrator da  193 from our observations with published results @xcite .",
    "the comparison suggests that the flux density of da  193 from our merlin observation was consistent with that from the vlbi measurements to within 7 per cent .",
    "we note that this systematic error includes both the amplitude calibration error of 3c  286 and the error induced by the intrinsic long - term variability of da  193 ; the latter is likely to be dominant .",
    "the optical and nir observations @xcite detect a secondary continuum peak , denoted 3c  48a , at @xmath01 arcsec northeast of the optical peak of 3c  48 .",
    "although merlin would be sensitive to any compact structure with this offset from the pointing centre , we did not find any significant radio emission associated with 3c  48a .",
    "there is no strong feature at the position of 3c  48a even in high - dynamic - range vla images @xcite .",
    "it is possibly that the radio emission from 3c  48a is intrinsically weak if 3c  48a is a disrupted nucleus of the companion galaxy without an active agn @xcite or 3c  48a is an active star forming region @xcite . in either case",
    ", the emission power of 3c  48a would be dominated by thermal sources and any radio radiation would be highly obscured by the surrounding interstellar medium .",

    "is thought to be located at the southern end of the jet , i.e. , close to the position of component a @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : vlbimap]-g at 8.3 ghz focuses on the nuclear region within 50 pc ( @xmath010 mas ) and clearly shows two well - separated components . beyond this distance the brightness of the inner jet is below the detection threshold .",
    "this is consistent with what was seen in the 8.4- and 15.4-ghz images from the 1996 vlba observations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : core ] focuses on the core a and inner jet out to the hot spot b. figure [ fig : core]-a shows the 1.5-ghz image from 2004 . unlike the image already shown in figure [ fig : vlbimap]-b , this image was produced with a super - uniform weighting of the @xmath29 plane ( see the caption of figure [ fig : core ] for details ) .",

    "the consistency of the jet morphology seen in both 1.5- and 4.8-ghz images and in both epochs may suggest that the oscillatory pattern of the jet seen on kpc scales ( figure [ fig : vlbimap ] ) may be traced back to the innermost jet on parsec scales .",

    "we will discuss the jet kinematics in detail in section [ section : pm ] .",
    "in order to measure the spectral properties of the 3c  48 jet , we re - mapped the 4.99-ghz merlin data acquired on 1992 june 15 @xcite and compared it with the 1.65-ghz evn+merlin data described in the present paper .",

    "spectral steepening in radio sources is a signature of a less efficient acceleration mechanism and/or the depletion of high - energy electrons through synchrotron / compton radiation losses and adiabatic losses as a result of the expansion of the plasma as it flows away from active acceleration region .",

    "the secondary one is located between vlbi jet components b and b2 , with an integrated polarized intensity of 0.23 jy and a mean degree of polarization @xmath39 per cent .",
    "both of the two peaks show clear deviations from the total intensity peaks in figure [ fig : mercont ] .",
    "these measurements of polarization structure and fractional polarization are in good agreement with those observed with the vla at 2-cm wavelength with a similar angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the integrated polarized flux density in the whole source is 0.64@xmath250.05 jy and the integrated fractional polarization is ( 4.9@xmath250.4 ) per cent .",
    "since the integrated polarized intensity is in fact a vector sum of different polarized sub - components , the percentage polarization calculated in this way represents a lower limit .",
    "we can see from the image ( figure [ fig : merpol ] ) that the percentage of the polarization at individual pixels is higher than 5 per cent , and increases toward the south of the nucleus .",
    "a maximum value of @xmath40 per cent is detected at @xmath00.045 arcsec south of the nucleus .",
    "the fractional polarization ( @xmath41 per cent ) measured from our merlin observation at 18 cm is at least an order of magnitude higher than the vla measurement at 20 cm , although it is consistent with the values measured by the vla at 6 cm and shorter wavelengths .",
    "this difference in the fractional polarization at these very similar wavelengths is most likely to be an observational effect due to beam depolarization , rather than being due to intrinsic variations in the faraday depth ( r.  perley , private communication ) .    the averaged polarization angle ( or evpa ) is @xmath42 in the polarization structure . on the basis of the new measurements of the rotation measure ( rm ) towards 3c  48 by mantovani et al .",

    "the polarization is as high as 40 per cent at the inner edge of the knot c , which would be consistent with the existence of a shear layer produced by the jet - ism interaction and/or a helical magnetic field ( 3c  43 : cotton et al . 2003 ; 3c  120 : gmez et al .",

    "this image displays a polarization structure in excellent agreement with that detected at 1.65 ghz with the evn , although the angular resolution is 3 times higher than the latter : the polarized emission mostly comes from the vicinity of component c and the fractional polarization increases where the jet bends ; the hot spot b and the core a are weakly polarized or not detected in polarization . the 1.65- and",
    "1.61-ghz images show detailed polarized structure in the component - c region on a spatial scale of tens of parsecs : the polarization angle ( evpa ) shows a gradual increase across component c , with a total range of @xmath49 , and the percentage of polarization gradually increases from 5 per cent to @xmath5030 per cent from the western edge to the eastern edge at both ` c - west ' and ` c - east ' .",
    "figure [ fig : vlbipol]-c and [ fig : vlbipol]-d show the 4.8- and 8.3-ghz polarization images made with the vlba data .",
    "both images were made by tapering the visibility data using a gaussian function in order to increase the signal - to - noise of the low - surface brightness emission .",
    "similar to what is seen in the 1.65 and 1.61-ghz images , component ` c - west ' shows a polarization angle that increases by @xmath51 across the component , but these images show the opposite sense of change of fractional polarization  fractional polarization decreases from 60 per cent down to 20 per cent from the northwest to the southeast .",
    "another distinct difference is that hot spot b shows increasing fractional polarization toward the higher frequencies , @xmath52 per cent at 4.8 ghz and @xmath53 per cent at 8.3 ghz in contrast with @xmath54 per cent at 1.6 ghz .",
    "the difference in the fractional polarizations of b at 1.6/4.8 ghz and 8.3 ghz imply that a component of the faraday screen is unresolved at 1.6 and 4.8 ghz and/or that some internal depolarization is at work .",
    "the non - detection of polarization from the core a at all four frequencies may suggest a tangled magnetic field at the base of the jet .",
    "we found at all four frequencies that the polarization angles undergo a rotation by @xmath55 across the jet ridge line at both the ` c - east ' and ` c - west ' components .",
    "there are four possible factors that may affect the observed polarization angle : ( 1 ) the calibration of the absolute evpas ; ( 2 ) faraday rotation caused by galactic ionized gas ; ( 3 ) faraday rotation due to gas within the 3c  48 system and ( 4 ) intrinsic polarization structure changes .",
    "the correction of absolute evpas applies to all polarization structure , so it can not explain the position - dependent polarization angle changes at component c ; in any case , the fact that we see similar patterns at four different frequencies , calibrated following independent procedures , rules out the possibility of calibration error .",
    "galactic faraday rotation is non - negligible ( section [ section : rm - reference ] ; @xmath43 rad m@xmath44 implies rotations from the true position angle of @xmath56 at 1.4 ghz , @xmath57 at 1.6 ghz , @xmath58 at 4.8 ghz and @xmath59 at 8.3 ghz ) , and means that we expect significant differences between the evpa measured at our different frequencies ; however , the galactic faraday screen should vary on much larger angular scales than we observe . only factors ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) , which reflect the situation internal to the 3c  48 system itself , will give rise to a position - dependent rotation of the evpas .",
    "the evpa gradient is related to the gradient of the rm and the intrinsic polarization angle by : @xmath60 , where the first term represents the rm gradient and the latter term represents the intrinsic polarization angle gradient . if the systematic gradient of evpas , @xmath61 , were solely attributed to an rm gradient , then @xmath62 would show a strong frequency dependence ; on the other hand , if @xmath61 is associated with the change of the intrinsic polarization angle , there is no frequency - dependence .",
    "we compared the @xmath63 at 1.6 and 4.8 ghz and found a ratio @xmath64 .",
    "this number falls between 1.0 ( the value expected if there were no rm gradient ) and 8.8 ( the ratio of @xmath65 ) , suggesting that a combination of rm and intrinsic polarization angle gradients are responsible for the systematic gradient of evpas at c. accordingly , it is worthwhile to attempt to measure the rm in the vlbi components of 3c  48 .",
    "the first two bands of the 20-cm vlba data ( centre frequency 1.408 ghz ) are separated from the last two bands ( centre frequency 1.608 ghz ) by 200 mhz , indicating a differential polarization angle of @xmath66 across the passband .",
    "the low integrated rotation measure means that the effects of faraday rotation are not significant ( @xmath67 ) between 4.8 and 8.3 ghz , while the absolute evpa calibration at 8.3 ghz is uncertain ; moreover , the _ uv _ sampling at 8.3 ghz is too sparse to allow us to image identical source structure at 1.5 and 4.8 ghz .",
    "therefore we used the 1.408 , 1.608 and 4.78 ghz data to map the rm distribution in 3c  48 .",
    "we first re - imaged the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 data at the three frequencies with a common _ uv _ cutoff at @xmath68400 k@xmath26 and restored with the same convolving beam .",
    "we tapered the @xmath29 plane weights when imaging the 4.78-ghz data in order to achieve a similar intrinsic resolution to that of the images at the two lower frequencies .",
    "we then made polarization angle images from the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 maps .",
    "the three polarization angle images were assembled to calculate the rm ( using aips task rm ) .",
    "the resulting rm image is shown in figure [ fig : rm ] .",
    "the image shows a smooth distribution of rm in the component - c region except for a region northeast of ` c - west ' . the superposed plots present the fits to the rm and intrinsic polarization angle ( @xmath69 , the orientation of polarization extrapolated at @xmath70 ) at four selected locations .",
    "the polarization position angles at individual frequencies have multiples of @xmath71 added or subtracted to remove the @xmath72 amibiguity .",
    "the errors in the calculated rms and @xmath69 are derived from the linear fits .",
    "we note that the systematic error due to the absolute evpa calibration feeds into the error on the observed polarization angle .",
    "all four fits show a good match with a @xmath65 law .",
    "the fitted parameters at ` p4 ' in the ` c - east ' region are consistent with those derived from the single - dish measurements for the overall source @xcite .",
    "the western component ( ` c - west ' ) shows a gradient of rm from @xmath73 rad m@xmath44 at ` p1 ' to @xmath74 rad m@xmath44 at ` p3 ' , and the intrinsic polarization angle varies from @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) at ` p1 ' , through @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) at ` p2 ' to @xmath79 at ` p3 ' .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the qualitative analysis of the evpa gradients above .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of the gradients of the rms and the intrinsic polarization angles is that the magnetic field orientation gradually varies across the jet ridge line ; for example , a helical magnetic field surrounding the jet might have this effect . an alternative interpretation for the enhancement of the rotation measurement at the edge of the jet is that it is associated with thermal electrons in a milliarcsec - scale faraday screens surrounding or inside the jet due to jet - ism interactions @xcite .",
    "more observations are needed to investigate the origins of the varying rm and @xmath69 .",
    "the hot spot b shows a much larger difference of evpas between 4.8 and 8.3 ghz than is seen in component c. this might be a signature of different rms at b and c. a rough calculation suggests a rm of @xmath80 rad  m@xmath44 at b. the high rotation measure and high fractional polarization ( section 4.2 ) is indicative of a strong , ordered magnetic field in the vicinity of b. this might be expected in a region containing a shock in which the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field and/or the density of thermal electrons are enhanced ; in fact , the proper motion of b ( section 4.5 ) does provide some evidence for a stationary shock in this region .      in order to make a quantitative study of the radiation properties of the compact vlbi components in 3c  48 , we fitted the images of compact components in the vlbi images from our new observations and from the vlba data taken in 1996 @xcite with gaussian models .",
    "measurements from the 1996 data used mapping parameters consistent with those for the 2004 images .",

    "the discrete compact components in the 4.8- and 8.3-ghz vlba images are well fitted with gaussian models along with a zero - level base and slope accounting for the extended background structure .",
    "the fit to extended emission structure is sensitive to the _ uv _ sampling and the sensitivity of the image .",
    "we have re - imaged the 1.5-ghz vlba image using the same parameters as for the 1.65-ghz evn image , i.e. , the same _ uv _ range and restoring beam . at 1.5 and 1.65",
    "ghz , gaussian models are good approximations to the emission structure of compact sources with high signal - to - noise ratio , such as components a and b. for extended sources ( i.e. , components b2 to d2 ) whose emission structures are either not well modelled by gaussian distribution , or blended with many sub - components , model fitting with a single gaussian model gives a larger uncertainty for the fitted parameters .",
    "in particular , the determination of the integrated flux density is very sensitive to the apparent source size .",
    "the uncertainties for the fitted parameters in table [ tab : model ] are derived from the output of the aips task jmfit .",
    "these fitting errors are sensitive to the intensity fluctuations in the images and source shapes . in most cases ,",
    "the fitting errors for the peak intensities of gaussian components are roughly equal to the _ r.m.s . _ noise .",
    "we note that the uncertainty on the integrated flux density should also contain systematic calibration errors propagated from the amplitude calibration of the visibility data , in addition to the fitting errors .",
    "the calibration error normally dominates over the fitting error .",
    "the amplitude calibration for the vlbi antennas was made from the measurements of system temperature ( @xmath81 ) at two - minute intervals during the observations combined with the antenna gain curves measured at each vlbi station .",
    "for the vlba data , this calibration has an accuracy @xmath825 per cent of the amplitude scale . because of the diversity of the antenna performance of the evn elements , we adopted an averaged amplitude calibration uncertainty of 5 per cent for the evn data .",
    "the positions of the vlbi core a1 at 4.8 , 8.3 and 15.4 ghz show good alignment within 0.4  mas at different frequencies and epochs .",
    "the positions of the unresolved core a at 1.5 and 1.65 ghz show a systematic northward offset by 24 mas relative to the position of a1 at higher frequencies .",
    "due to the low resolution and high opacity at 1.5 ghz , the position of a at this frequency reflects the centroid of the blended emission structure of the active galactic nucleus and inner 40-pc jet . the parameters that we have derived for the compact components a",
    ", b and b2 in epoch 1996 are in good agreement with those determined by worrall et al .",
    "( 2004 ) at the same frequency band .",
    "the results for fitting to extended knots at 1.5 and 1.65 ghz are in less good agreement .",
    "this is probably because of the different _ uv _ sampling on short spacings , meaning that the vlba and evn data sample different extended structures in the emission .",
    "the integrated flux densities of the vlbi components a1 and a2 in 1996x ( 8.3  ghz ) are higher than those in 2004x ( 8.3  ghz ) by @xmath0100 per cent ( a1 ) and @xmath060 per cent ( a2 ) , respectively . the large discrepancy in the flux densities of a1 and a2 between epochs 1996x and 2004x",
    "can not easily be interpreted as an amplitude calibration error of larger than 60 per cent since we do not see a variation at a comparable level in the flux densities of components b , b2 and d. although the _ total _ flux densities of css sources in general exhibit no violent variability at radio wavelengths , the possibility of small - amplitude ( @xmath82100 per cent ) variability in the vlbi core and inner jet components is not ruled out .",
    "component a1 has a flat spectrum with @xmath83 between 4.8 and 8.3 ghz in epoch 2004 ; component a2 has a rather steeper spectrum with @xmath84 ( epoch 2004 ) .",
    "the spectral properties of these two components support the idea that a1 is associated with the active nucleus and suffers from synchrotron self - absorption at centimetre radio wavelengths ; in this picture , a2 is the innermost jet .",
    "the spectral indices of components b and b2 in epoch 2004 are @xmath85 ( b ) and @xmath86 ( b2 ) , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the measurements from the 1.65 and 4.99 ghz images ( figure [ fig : spix ] ) .",
    "component d shows a relatively flatter spectrum in epoch 2004 with @xmath87 , in contrast to the other jet knots . while this spectral index is consistent with those of the shock - accelerated hot spots in radio galaxies , the flattening of the spectrum in d might also arise from a local compression of particles and magnetic field .",
    "table [ tab : tb ] lists the brightness temperatures ( @xmath88 ) of the compact vlbi components a1 , a2 and b. all these vlbi components have a brightness temperatures ( @xmath88 ) higher than @xmath89k , confirming their non - thermal origin .",
    "these brightness temperatures are well below the @xmath90  k upper limit constrained by the inverse compton catastrophic @xcite , suggesting that the relativistic jet plasma is only mildly beamed toward the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath88 of a1 is about 3 times higher than that of a2 at 4.8 and 8.3  ghz , and the @xmath88 of a1 decreases toward higher frequencies .",
    "together with the flat spectrum and variability of a1 , the observed results are consistent with a1 being the self - absorbed core harbouring the agn .",
    "@xmath88 is much higher in 1996x than 2004x for both a1 and a2 , a consequence of the measured flux density variation between the two epochs .",
    "the gaussian fitting results presented in table [ tab : model ] may be used to calculate the proper motions of vlbi components . in order to search for proper motions in 3c  48 ,",
    "maps at different epochs should be aligned at a compact component such as the core @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to our new vlbi observations we know that aligning the cores at 1.5-ghz is not likely to be practical , since the core structure appears to be changing on the relevant timescales . even at 4.8 ghz",
    ", the core still blends with the inner jet a2 in epoch 1996c ( figure [ fig : core ] ) .",
    "in contrast to these two lower frequencies , the 8.3-ghz images have higher resolution , better separation of a1 and a2 , and less contamination from extended emission . these make 8.3-ghz images the best choice for the proper motion analysis . in the following discussion of proper motion measurements we rely on the 8.3  ghz images .",
    "we have already commented on the shift of the peak of a2 to the north from epochs 1996x to 2004x in figure [ fig : core ] .",
    "a quantitative calculation based on the model fitting results gives a positional variation of 1.38 mas to the north and 0.15 mas to the west during a time span 8.43 yr , assuming that the core a1 is stationary .",
    "that corresponds to a proper motion of @xmath91 mas yr@xmath8 ( minus mean moving to the west ) and @xmath92 mas yr@xmath8 , corresponding to an apparent transverse velocity of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the error quoted here includes both the positional uncertainty derived from gaussian fitting and the relative offset of the reference point ( _ i.e. _ , a1 ) .",
    "that means that we detect a significant ( @xmath95 ) proper motion for a2 moving to the north .",
    "the apparent transverse velocity for a2 is similar to velocities derived from other css and gps sources in which apparent superluminal motions in the pc - scale jet have been detected , e.g. , 3.39.7@xmath96 in 3c  138 @xcite .",
    "we also searched for evidence for proper motions of the other jet knots .",
    "the proper motion measurement is limited by the accuracy of the reference point alignment , our ability to make a high - precision position determination at each epoch , and the contamination from extended structure .",
    "we found only a @xmath97 proper motion from b2 , which shows a position change of @xmath98 mas and @xmath99 mas in 8.43 yr , corresponding to an apparent velocity of @xmath100 to the northeast .",
    "the measurements of the position variation of the hot spot b between 1996x and 2004x show no evidence for proper motion with @xmath101 mas yr@xmath8 and @xmath102 mas yr@xmath8 .",
    "worrall et al . ( 2004 ) earlier reported a @xmath97 proper motion for b by comparing the the 1.5-ghz vlba image taken in 1996 with wilkinson et al s 1.6-ghz image from 11.8 years previously .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the 1.5-ghz measurements are subject to the problems of lower angular resolution , poor reference point alignment and contamination from structural variation .",
    "in particular , if we extrapolate the observed angular motion of a2 back , the creation of jet component a2 took place in 1984 , therefore in 1996 a2 would still have been blended with a1 in the 1.5-ghz image within @xmath103 beam .",
    "the fitting of a gaussian to the combination of a1 and a2 at 1.5 ghz on epoch 1996 would then have suffered from the effects of the structural changes in the core due to the expansion of a2 . for these reasons",
    "we conclude that the hot spot b is stationary to the limit of our ability to measure motions . for the other jet components ,",
    "the complex source structure does not permit any determination of proper motions .",
    "most css sources show double or triple structures on kpc scales , analogous to classical fr  i or fr  ii galaxies . however , some css sources show strongly asymmetric structures . at small viewing angles ,",

    "the results imply that the 3c  48 jet moves at @xmath118 along a viewing angle less than @xmath119 .      as discussed in section [ section : vlbimap ] the bright jet knots define a sinusoidal ridge line .",
    "this is the expected appearance of a helically twisted jet projected on to the plane of the sky .",
    "helical radio jets , or jet structure with multiple bends , can be triggered by periodic variations in the direction of ejection ( e.g. , precession of the jet nozzle ) , and/or random perturbations at the start of the jet ( e.g. , jet - cloud collisions ) .",

    "( we note that , although we have measured lower proper motion velocities in b and b2 than the velocity in the inner jet a2 , this does not necessarily imply deceleration in the outer jet flow , since the brightening at b , and to some extent at b2 , may arise mostly from stationary shocks ; the proper motions of b and b2 thus represent a lower limit on the actual bulk motions of the jet . )",
    "we further assume the origin of the precession arises from the central black hole and accretion disk system , so that ( @xmath125,@xmath126,@xmath127 ) can be taken as zero .",
    "in the observer s frame the jet trajectory shown in the clean image can be acquired by projecting the 3-d jet on the plane of the sky and then performing a rotation by an angle @xmath121 in the plane of the sky so that the y - axis aligns to the north ( declination ) and x - axis points to the east ( right ascension ) .",
    "in addition to the above parameters , we need to define a rotation sign parameter @xmath128 ( @xmath129 means counterclockwise rotation ) and jet side parameter ( @xmath130 means the jet moves toward the observer ) . since we are dealing with the advancing jet , the jet side parameter",

    "in particular , the inner - kpc jet is seen to be physically interacting with a massive gas system , and the observed blue - shifted nir clouds could be driven by the radio jet to move at velocities up to 1000 km  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the 3c  48 radio jet thus might lose a fraction of its kinetic energy , resulting in a slowing down of the jet flow and the shrinking of the wavelength in the outer jet , assuming that the precessing periodicity is not destroyed .",

    "( we should note that although we used an apparent velocity @xmath142 with same value in model 1 , the jet speed @xmath122 in the k - h model is the pattern speed , and therefore the real flow speed and the viewing angle in the k - h model are more uncertain than for the ballistic case . ) in addition , we assume that the initial perturbations originate from a region very close to the central engine .",

    "moreover , we assumed an initial position angle @xmath144 , and again introduced a rate @xmath145 to explain the eastward tilting of the jet axis .",
    "the half opening angle , which is a parameter to be fitted , is assumed constant .",
    "this assumption is plausible since the jet width seems not to change much within 0.5 arcsec , indicating that the trajectory of the jet is not disrupted even given the occurrence of a number of jet - ism interactions .",
    "in addition to the above morphological assumptions , the model also assumes the conservation of specific momentum and kinetic energy @xmath146 along the jet axis .",
    "the conservation of specific momentum is equivalent to a constant velocity along the jet axis if mass loss or entrainment are negligible .",
    "the combination of the conservation of specific momentum and kinetic energy along the jet axis results in a constant pitch angle along the helical jet .",
    "furthermore , the constant jet opening angle and pitch angle lead to a helical geometry in which the oscillatory wavelength linearly increases with time .",
    "the parameter @xmath143 controls how fast the wavelength varies ( equation 12 : steffen et al .",
    "the model describes a self - similar helical trajectory with a number of revolutions as long as the helical amplitude is not dampened too rapidly .",
    "the modelled curve is exhibited in the lower panel of figure [ fig : helicalfit ] .",
    "the assumed and fitted parameters are listed in table [ tab : helicalfit ] . as mentioned above",
    ", this k - h instability model predicts that , when the helical amplitude is not dampened and the opening angle @xmath123 is small ( @xmath147 ) , the oscillating wavelength ( or period ) along the jet axis increases linearly with time .",
    "the fits give an initial wavelength of 60 mas and initial period of 370 yr . the period increases to @xmath148 yr at the end of the plot window of 9000 yr . the fitted curve displays more oscillations in the inner part of the jet and smoother structure in the outer part , due to the decreasing angular velocity downstream . the initial transverse distance @xmath143 represents the location where the k - h instability starts to grow in the surface of the jet .",
    "it is associated with the varying rate of the wavelength .",
    "a value of @xmath149 mas corresponds to a projected linear distance of 9.2 pc off the jet axis .",
    "as discussed above , the major discrepancy between the helical model and the real 3c  48 jet could be the assumption of the conservation of kinetic energy @xmath141 .",
    "we have tried to fit the helical model without the conservation of kinetic energy but with conserved angular momentum , which is in principle similar to case 4 in steffen et al .",
    "however , in this case , the modelled helix rapidly evolves into a straight line , and thus fails to reproduce the observed 3c  48 jet on kpc scales .",
    "both two models give fits to the overall jet structure of 3c  48 within 0.45 arcsec with 23 complete revolutions , but they have some differences in detail .",
    "the helical shape of the precessing jet is a superposition of ballistic jet knots modulated by a nodding motion ( nutation ) . in this case",
    ", the whole jet envelope wiggles out and shows a restricted periodicity .",
    "the observed jet structure displays a smooth shape on rather smaller scales .",
    "if , alternatively , the coherent , smooth jet stream is initially disturbed at the jet base , and is amplified by the kelvin - helmholtz instability downstream in the jet , the jet stream itself is bent .",
    "the resulting helical jet flow rotates faster at the start and gradually slows down as it moves further away .",
    "if the twisted inner jet morphology detected at 1.5 and 4.8 ghz ( figure [ fig : core ] ) is real , this would support the k - h instability model .",
    "further high - dynamic - range vlbi maps of the inner jet region could test this scenario .",
    "in addition to the morphological discrepancy , the two models require different physical origins .",
    "in the precessing - jet model , ballistic knots are ejected in different directions which are associated with an ordered rotation in the jet flow direction in the vicinity of the central engine .",
    "if the precession results from a rotating injector at the jet base ( see discussion in worrall et al . 2007 ) , the precession period of 0.2 million yr requires a radius of @xmath150 pc , assuming the injector is in a keplerian motion around the black hole .",
    "this size scale is much larger than the accretion disk , and so we may simply rule out the possibility of an injection from the rotating accretion disk . instead the long - term precession can plausibly take place in a binary smbh system or a tilting accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the precessing period caused by a tilting disk is @xmath151 yr , assuming a @xmath152 smbh for 3c  48 , a dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath153 and the dimentionless specific angular momentum of the black hole @xmath154 @xcite . in this scenario , the short - term nodding motion can then be triggered by the tidally - induced torque on the outer brim of the wobbling accretion disk , analogous to ss  433 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the helical k - h instabilities modes can be triggered by ordered or random perturbations to the jet flow . the fits with model 2",
    "give an initial perturbation period @xmath155 yr , which leads to a radius of @xmath156 pc where perturbations take place .",
    "this radius is still larger than the size of the accretion disk , but at this size scale it is still plausible for the perturbations to be due to interactions between the jet flow and the broad - line - region clouds ( e.g. 3c120 : @xcite ) .",
    "however , the high faraday depth and/or the possible internal depolarization structure in the radio core a makes it difficult to investigate this scenario through vlbi polarimetric measurements .",
    "in addition , k - h instabilities would not only produce simple helical modes , but also many other instability modes mixed together ; the k - h interpretation of the oscillatory 3c  48 jet on both pc and kpc scales requires a selection of modes or a simple mix of low - order modes .",
    "however , it is difficult to see how these required modes are excited while others with higher growth rates are suppressed ( see the discussion of the wiggling filament in ngc  315 by worrall et al .",
    "moreover , the k - h model does not have a ready explanation for the observed large - scale gradual bend of the jet axis .",
    "simple kinematical models , such as a reflection by an oblique shock or a pressure gradient in the narrow - line - region ism , may not be adequate to explain the bends of the robust ( @xmath157 ) jet flow .",
    "we have observed 3c  48 at multiple frequencies with the vlba , evn and merlin with spatial resolutions between tens and hundreds of parsec .",
    "our principal results may be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the total - intensity merlin image of 3c  48 is characterized by two components with comparable integrated flux density .",
    "a compact component aligns with the vlbi jet , while an extended envelope surrounds it .",
    "the extended emission structure becomes diffuse and extends toward the northeast at @xmath00.25 arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "the extended component shows a steeper spectrum than the compact jet .",
    "\\(2 ) in the vlba and evn images , the compact jet seen in the merlin image is resolved into a series of bright knots .",
    "knot a is further resolved into two smaller features a1 and a2 in 4.8- and 8.3-ghz vlba images .",
    "a1 shows a flat spectrum with spectral index @xmath158 .",
    "a2 shows a steep spectrum with @xmath159 , and may be identified with the inner jet .",
    "the brightness temperature of a1 is @xmath160  k and much higher than the @xmath88 of a2 .",
    "the flux densities of a1 and a2 in epoch 2004 show a 100 and 60 per cent decrease compared with those in 1996 .",
    "the high brightness temperature , flat spectrum and variability imply that a1 is the synchrotron self - absorbed core found close to the active nucleus .",
    "\\(3 ) comparison of the present vlba data with those of 1996 january 20 strongly suggests that a2 is moving , with an apparent velocity @xmath161 to the north .",
    "combining the apparent superluminal motion and the jet - to - counterjet intensity ratio yields a constraint on the jet kinematics and geometry : the jet is relativistic ( @xmath162 ) and closely aligned to the line of sight ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) we present for the first time vlbi polarization images of 3c  48 , which reveal polarized structures with multiple sub - components in component c. the fractional polarization peaks at the interface between the compact jet and the surrounding medium , perhaps consistent with a local jet - induced shock .",
    "the systematic gradient of the evpas across the jet width at c can be attributed to the combination of a gradient in the emission - weighted intrinsic polarization angle across the jet and possibly a systematic gradient in the rm .",
    "changing magnetic field directions are a possible interpretation of the rm gradient , but other alternatives can not be ruled out .",
    "the fractional polarization of the hot spot b increases towards higher frequencies , from @xmath164 per cent ( 1.6 ghz ) , @xmath165 per cent ( 4.8 ghz ) to @xmath166 per cent ( 8.3 ghz ) . the relatively low degree of polarization at lower frequencies probably results from a unresolved faraday screen associated with the nlr clouds and/or the internal depolarization in the jet itself .",
    "hot spot b has a higher rm than c , which can perhaps be attributed to a stationary shock in the vicinity of b. the core a at all frequencies is unpolarized , which may be the result of a tangled magnetic field in the inner part of the jet .",
    "\\(5 ) the combined evn+merlin 1.65-ghz image and 1.5-ghz vlba images show that the bright knots trace out a wave - like shape within the jet .",
    "we fitted the jet structure with a simple precession model and a k - h instability model .",
    "both models in general reproduce the observed oscillatory jet trajectory , but neither of them is able to explain all the observations .",
    "more observations are required to investigate the physical origin of the helical pattern .",
    "further monitoring of the proper motion of the inner jet a2 should be able to constrain the ballistic motion in the framework of the precessing jet .",
    "high - resolution vlbi images of the inner jet region will be required to check whether or not the jet flow is oscillating on scales of tens of mas , which might give a morphological means of discriminating between the two models .",
    "sophisticated simulations of the jet would be needed to take into account the deceleration of the jet flow due to kinetic energy loss via jet - cloud interaction and radiation loss , but these are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
