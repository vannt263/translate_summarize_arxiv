    "these lower polaritons form a 2d weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "the extremely light mass of these bosonic quasiparticles at experimentally achievable excitonic densities , results in a relatively high critical temperature for superfluidity , because the 2d thermal de broglie wavelength , which becomes comparable to the distance between the bosons , is inversely proportional to the mass of the quasiparticle .",

    "significant excitonic effects related to strong - electron - hole correlations were observed in graphene by measuring its optical conductivity in a broad spectral range  @xcite . the observed excitonic resonance was explained within a phenomenological model as a fano interference of a strongly coupled excitonic state and a band continuum  heinz .",
    "the electron - hole pair condensation in the two graphene layers have been studied in refs .  .",
    "the possibility of formation of edge - state excitons in graphene nanoribbons is caused by the appearance of the gap in the electron energy spectrum due to the finite size quantization .",
