    "the origin of hot hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars ( spectral types [ wc ] and pg1159 ) is supposed to be a late he - shell flash .",
    "detailed summaries on their spectroscopic characteristics and quantitative analyses , and relevant evolutionary calculations can be found e.g.  in werner ( 2001 ) and herwig ( 2001 ) , respectively .    in the last white dwarf workshop , held in delaware two years ago , we presented for the first time clear evidence for iron deficiency in a pg1159 star ( miksa 2001 )",
    ". because pg1159 central stars are very hot (  @xmath075000k ) , the metals are highly ionized .",
    "the dominant ionization stage of iron in the line formation region is and most of its lines are located in the fuv spectral region .",
    "contrary to our expectation we were not able to detect any line in the fuse fuv spectrum of the pulsating central star of k1 - 16 , which means that iron is deficient by at least one dex .",
    "this has initiated an effort to utilize archival iue and hst spectra as well as new fuse spectra to look for iron in other pg1159 stars ( miksa 2002 ) .",
    "it turned out that iue and hst spectra do show a hint of iron deficiency in some other objects , but the data quality is not sufficient for reliable quantitative analyses .",
    "the same holds for a number of fuse spectra from pg1159 stars .",
    "however , in two more cases , where fuse spectra with sufficiently high s / n were obtained , we were successful in proving that iron is deficient .",
    "the first one is the central star of ngc7094 , which is classified as a hybrid - pg1159 star , because it exhibits h balmer lines .",
    "no iron lines were detected and we concluded that iron is depleted by at least 1.5 dex ( miksa 2002 ) .",
    "the next case is the central star of abell  78 , which is classified as one of the rare [ wc]pg1159 transition objects . for abell  78",
    "we find an iron deficiency of 1.5 dex from the lack of iron lines as well ( werner 2002a ) .    what is the origin of the iron deficiency ?",
    "we think that iron has been transformed to heavier elements .",
    "the high c and o abundances in pg1159 stars result from envelope mixing caused by a late he - shell flash .",
    "this event also modifies the near - solar abundance ratios of iron - peak elements in the envelope by dredging up matter in which s - process elements were built - up by n - capture on @xmath1fe seeds during the agb phase .",
    "this scenario can and will be tested by analyzing the resulting fe / ni abundance ratio , because it is significantly changed in the intershell region in favor of ni by the conversion of @xmath1fe into @xmath2ni .",
    "more quantitative results from nucleosynthesis calculations in appropriate stellar models have been presented recently ( herwig 2002 ) and inclusion of nuclear networks in evolutionary model sequences will become available in the near future .",
    "interestingly , asplund ( 1999 ) have found that in sakurai s object , which is thought to undergo a late he - shell flash , iron is reduced to 0.1 solar and fe / ni@xmath33 .",
    "this and other s - process signatures should also be exhibited by wolf - rayet type central stars and pg1159 stars . and",
    "in fact , latest results confirm that iron deficiency among h - deficient post - agb stars is not restricted to pg1159 stars .",
    "it appears that three wolf - rayet type central stars are iron deficient , too .",
    "grfener ( 2002 ) report a low iron abundance in smp61 , an early type [ wc5 ] central star in the lmc .",
    "its abundance is at least 0.7dex below the lmc metallicity .",
    "crowther ( 2002 ) find evidence for an iron underabundance of 0.30.7dex in the galactic [ wc ] type central stars stars ngc  40 ( [ wc8 ] ) and bd+30@xmath43639 ( [ wc9 ] ) . in this context",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the hot do white dwarf  is iron deficient and rich in nickel ( barstow 2000 ) . if this is related to the iron deficiency in pg1159 stars is an open question .",
    "h1504 + 65 is the most extreme pg1159 star , not only because of its extraordinarily high effective temperature , which is close to 200000k .",
    "we have shown that h1504 + 65 is not only hydrogen - deficient but also helium - deficient . from optical spectra",
    "it was concluded that the atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon and oxygen , by equal amounts .",
    "neon lines were detected in soft x - ray spectra taken with the euve satellite and in an optical - uv keck spectrum , and a neon abundance of 25% ( mass fraction ) was derived ( werner & wolff 1999 ) .    h1504",
    "+ 65 was observed with chandra on sep .",
    "27 , 2000 , with an integration time of 7 hours .",
    "flux was detected in the range 60160  and the spectral resolution is about 0.1 .",
    "the spectrum displays astonishing details ( fig.1 ) . at first sight",
    "the spectrum appears to be rather noisy , but comparison with model spectra suggests that most absorption features in the observation are probably real .",
    "mg lines are discovered for the first time in h1504 + 65 ( see werner ( 2002b ) for more details ) .",
    "exploratory models including opacities of heavy metals ( ca  ni ) were computed .",
    "this introduces a very large number of additional lines , however , identifying individual heavy metal lines will be problematic or even impossible , because the vast majority of lines in the available lists have uncertain wavelength positions .",
    "the mg abundance is of the order 2% , similar to the ne abundance determined earlier .",
    "this allows two alternative interpretations .",
    "either we see a naked c - o white dwarf with 3@xmath5 processed matter , which is , according to evolutionary models , dominated by c and o with an admixture of @xmath6ne and @xmath7 mg of the order 1% .",
    "or we see a naked o - ne - mg white dwarf which has undergone carbon burning .",
    "a comparison with the respective evolutionary models ( ritossa et al .  1999 ) suggests that we could look onto such a naked remnant where @xmath8ne and a mixture of several mg isotopes ( @xmath9mg,@xmath7mg,@xmath10 mg ) should be present .",
    "we have already speculated earlier , that the onset of c burning and subsequent evolutionary processes might explain the uniqueness of h1504 + 65 . in order to confirm this idea",
    ", we will also look for na absorption lines , because the stellar models predict a relatively high amount of @xmath11na in this case .",
    "to conclude , h1504 + 65 might have been one of the `` heavyweight '' intermediate - mass stars ( 9m@xmath12 11m@xmath13 ) which form white dwarfs with electron - degenerate o - ne - mg cores resulting from carbon burning .",
    "this speculation is corroborated by the fact that h1504 + 65 is one of the most massive pg1159 stars known ( 0.86@xmath140.15m@xmath15 ) .",
