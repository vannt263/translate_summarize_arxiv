    "the possible existence of pentaquarks was first proposed a long time ago @xcite but the subject regained theoretical interest after such exotic states were indeed measured @xcite . in the recent months",
    "many works have been dedicated to the calculation of pentaquark properties @xcite , a theoretical pioneer work being the one that classified a narrow strange pentaquark with positive parity as the lowest state of an @xmath3 decuplet within a chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "three of the possible pentaquarks are the @xmath0 @xcite containing the quarks @xmath4 with mass 1540 mev , @xmath5 , zero isospin ( @xmath6 ) and positive charge , the @xmath7 , formed by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the @xmath11 constituted of quarks @xmath12 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and neutral , the last two with masses equal to 1862 mev , detected in @xcite but not confirmed in other experiment @xcite .",
    "another topic of great interest in the recent literature is the in - medium modification of baryon properties , mainly their masses and decay widths @xcite .    in the present work we use the quark - meson coupling model ( qmc )",
    "@xcite in order to obtain the effective masses of the pentaquarks @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a self - consistent way with the nucleon mass .",
    "we fix the nucleon radius and determine the pentaquark radius considering the same bag constant of the nucleon .",
    "we compare the chemical potential of the pentaquarks determined in this way with the chemical potential of the nucleon plus kaon system as a function of the density . a comparison with the results obtained within the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) @xcite is drawn .",
    "in the qmc model , the baryons are assumed to be static spherical mit bags in which quarks interact with the scalar and vector fields , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and these fields are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation . in the present work we treat nucleons and pentaquarks within the same formalism , the differences arising from the number and flavor of the constituent quarks .",
    "we consider both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 in nuclear matter and assume that non - strange mesons do not couple with the @xmath16 quarks .",
    "the quark field , @xmath17 , inside the bag satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath18 \\,\\psi_q(x)=0\\ , \\quad   q = u , d , s , \\label{eq - motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the classical meson fields for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "@xmath22 is the current quark mass , @xmath23 is the third component of the pauli matrices and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the quark couplings with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "the quark energy is @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the bag radius of the baryon .",
    "the energy of a static bag describing the baryon @xmath31 , can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a parameter which accounts for zero - point motion and @xmath34 is the bag constant .",
    "the set of parameters used in the present work is given in @xcite for the bag value @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 mev .",
    "the effective mass of the nucleon and the pentaquark at rest is taken to be @xmath38 the equilibrium condition for the bag is obtained by minimizing the effective masses @xmath39 with respect to the bag radius @xmath40 all the above expressions are valid for the nucleons and the pentaquarks .",
    "we have considered the same bag constant @xmath34 for both .",
    "the radius and the @xmath33 parameter for the pentaquark are then obtained from equations ( [ eff - mn ] ) ( for the vacuum ) and ( [ balance ] ) .",
    "it is not clear if the spin parity of the pentaquark @xmath0 is @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "constituent quark models predict the first value @xcite and chiral symmetric models the second @xcite . within the qmc model",
    ", we may have a positive parity state if one of the quarks occupies a @xmath43 state .",
    "however , this is not the lowest energy state . in the following we also consider this possibility .    for simplicity , we assume that the bag describing the nucleon remains in a spherical shape with radius @xmath30 .",
    "the single - particle energies in units of @xmath44 are given as @xcite @xmath45 for quarks and antiquarks , with @xmath46 the eigenvalues @xmath47 for the state characterized by @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined by the boundary condition at the bag surface , @xmath50 we get for the total energy @xmath51 for the qmc model the equations of motion for the meson fields in uniform static matter are the ones usually given in the literature @xcite .",
    "for the necessary self - consistent treatment , one has to determine @xmath52    notice that , although we have included the @xmath15 meson in the equations above , we shall restrict ourselves to the calculation of symmetric nuclear matter . moreover , as we have opted to use identical masses for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 quarks , the pentaquarks @xmath11 and @xmath7 are indistinguishable .",
    "boosting the bags we get the dispersion relation for the pentaquarks @xmath55 we also calculate the optical potential of a pentaquark in symmetric nuclear matter , which we define as @xmath56    in the numerical calculations we have used @xcite @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with the standard values for the meson masses , @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 mev and @xmath65 mev .",
    "note that in our approach the @xmath66-quark is unaffected by the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons i.e. @xmath67 the pentaquark couplings are given by @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we give the values of @xmath70 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 considering the radius of the nucleon 0.6 and 1.0 fm and the three different cases : a ) all quarks in a @xmath66 state ; b ) quarks @xmath53 or @xmath54 in a @xmath43 state ; c ) quarks @xmath71 or @xmath66 in a @xmath43 state .    in the next section",
    "we compare the qmc results obtained in the present work with results obtained from the nlwm model @xcite with the nl3 parametrization @xcite . in this model",
    "the effective mass of a baryon is @xmath72 @xcite . using quark counting arguments and considering that the @xmath73 mesons do not couple to the @xmath66-quark we take @xmath74",
    "the in - medium results obtained with the qmc model for the pentaquarks are next displayed and compared with the ones obtained with the nlwm .    in figure [ effm ]",
    "we show the effective masses for the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 for two different values of the bag radius . for the larger value of the bag radius ,",
    "the decrease of the effective masses is less pronounced for both pentaquarks .",
    "our results do not agree with the ones calculated in @xcite , where , however , the nucleon saturation data of @xcite are also not reproduced .",
    "the @xmath0 effective masses always decrease more with density than @xmath1 , either within the qmc or the nlwm framework .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath66-quark does not couple to the @xmath13-meson and @xmath1 have two @xmath66-quarks .",
    "for each pentaquark , one can see that the effective masses always decrease more within the nlwm than within the qmc model .",
    "this effect was already known for the effective mass of the nucleon : for the the saturation density , qmc gives an effective mass @xmath75 0.8 @xmath76 while the nlwm predicts @xmath75 0.7 @xmath76 .    in fig .",
    "[ meff1 ] we replot the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effective masses in separate graphs .",
    "we include the results obtained considering a quark in a @xmath77 state",
    ". a smaller decrease of the effective mass with density is observed , but the mass difference with respect to the solution with all quarks in a @xmath66 state is small .",
    "we have also verified that isospin asymmetry of nuclear matter has little effect on the effective mass of the pentaquarks : for a proton fraction @xmath78 there is a small increase of the effective mass with density with respect to the symmetric matter value . however , at 3@xmath79 the difference is only @xmath80 the symmetric matter value .",
    "we have calculated the radii for three different particles , namely , the nucleon , the kaon and the pentaquark @xmath0 fixing the nucleon radius as 0.6 fm and choosing for the other particles the same bag constant .",
    "it is known that qmc predicts a small reduction of the baryon radius with density @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ rad ] we plot , in units of the vacuum nucleon radius , the radius of these three particles .",
    "one can see that the @xmath0 radius is only 16% larger than the nucleon radius and presents the same behavior with density .    in figure [ disp ]",
    "we have shown the optical potentials obtained within both models discussed in the present work . within the qmc model",
    "we get an optical potential of @xmath75 @xmath81 mev for the @xmath0 pentaquark and @xmath75 @xmath82 mev for the @xmath83 pentaquarks .",
    "these values are just a bit smaller than the ones predicted with the nlwm and are compatible with values obtained in @xcite , @xmath75 @xmath84 to @xmath85 mev obtained from the calculus of the @xmath0 self - energy tied to a two - meson cloud . in @xcite",
    "a value @xmath86 mev was obtained within a qcd sum rule calculation and similar numbers were obtained within a relativistic mean field calculation in @xcite . taking different values for the bag radius has a negligible effect on the potential .    in order to understand under",
    "which conditions the @xmath0 is stable in the medium with respect to the channel @xmath87 we have calculated within the qmc model the chemical potential of the pentaquark given by eq .",
    "( [ mutheta ] ) , with the chemical potential of the system nucleon plus kaon . for the kaon",
    "we use the results of @xcite .",
    "we consider a pentaquark in its rest frame and suppose it decays , @xmath88 . in the matter , due to the pauli principle the nucleon must have a momentum equal to the fermi momentum .",
    "the kaon will have the same momentum if we do nt take into account the effect of the medium .",
    "taking into account the medium , momentum may be shared by any other nucleons and the kaon will come out with any momentum . in fig .",
    "[ chem ] we plot the chemical potential of the @xmath0 at rest , and the chemical potential of the system @xmath89 in two different cases : a ) both particles with @xmath90 ; b ) the nucleon with @xmath90 and the kaon with a zero momentum .",
    "considering the second possibility the pentaquark @xmath0 will not be stable in matter . if we consider the first possibility the pentaquark @xmath0 is stable for densities @xmath91 .",
    "however , according to @xcite , the @xmath92 feels a weak repulsive potential and the @xmath93 a strong attractive one . in order to obtain a value approximately equal to 10 mev for the @xmath92 potential in the present formalism , we must rescaled the coupling @xmath94 as 1.625 @xmath95 for the nucleon bag radius @xmath96 fm and the kaon bag radius @xmath97 fm ( see @xcite . taking this value we get different results for the chemical potential of the system nucleon plus kaon represented by thin dashed ( @xmath98 ) and dashed - dot ( @xmath99 ) lines in fig .",
    "[ chem ] . in this case",
    "we could have stable pentaquarks , respectively , for densities larger than @xmath79 ( @xmath100 ) if we consider the process @xmath88 ( @xmath101 ) .    in this short note",
    "we have calculated the behavior of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pentaquarks in the medium according to the predictions of the qmc model .",
    "in particular we have calculated the effective mass and the optical potential of those particles as a function of density .",
    "it was shown , by comparing the chemical potentials of the @xmath0 and the @xmath89 system that @xmath0 is stable against the decay @xmath2 for @xmath102 . however , taking into account the medium , @xmath0 is not stable even at high densities .",
    "however , these limits are sensitive to the kaon optical potential and they could be lowered , respectively , for @xmath79 and @xmath103 if we choose a @xmath104 coupling constant which reproduces the @xmath92 optical potencial accepted value of 10 mev at saturation density .    there have been recent calculations of the pentaquarks in the medium using the same model @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that in @xcite the properties of the @xmath0 have not been calculated in a self consistent way in the qmc model and in @xcite the data obtained for the nucleon properties are not in accordance with the data in the literature @xcite .",
