    "vortices of persistent current in superconductors have been viewed for a long time as a testing ground for various models of classical and quantum phase transitions .",
    "this is due to relatively strong interactions between vortices coupled with a high degree of control over the vortex arrays .",
    "for example , inter - vortex interactions in the presence of a periodic external potential ( created experimentally by modulation of the superconducting film thickness @xcite ) made vortices a convenient target for investigation of commensurability transitions.@xcite theoretical studies of the effects of randomness on vortex structure and vortex dynamics have led to the notion of collective pinning,@xcite with importance stretching well beyond the physics of superconductivity.@xcite later , the discovery of high - temperature superconductors triggered studies of the vortex lattice melting transition and glassy behavior@xcite in layered superconductors as well as structural transitions of vortices interacting with columnar defects.@xcite because vortices in continuous superconductors have normal cores , vortex motion is dissipative@xcite and much of the above - mentioned work used classical statistical mechanics to address collective phenomena in vortex arrays.@xcite    the effects of quantum fluctuations of vortices in continuous films become important only close to the supeconductor - insulator transition , which requires special tuning of the films normal - state resistance.@xcite in arrays of josephson junctions , however , vortices do not have cores , allowing for the study of quantum fluctuations .",
    "an array of small superconducting islands connected by josephson junctions , where the island charging energies were sufficiently large for quantum effects to be important,@xcite was used in attempts to observe a quantum kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite and mott transition@xcite in a 1d array .",
    "while these works advanced the nanofabrication techniques needed to produce highly regular arrays of small josephson junctions , the measurement results were ambiguous .",
    "the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristics gave inconclusive evidence for a kt transition in single - line 1d arrays.@xcite the observations of ref .",
    "were later interpreted to be consistent with a purely classical commensurability transition rather than the quantum mott transition.@xcite the suppression of quantum effects in these experiments stemmed from the low inductance of the continuous superconducting wires , which were necessary to make the josephson junction arrays .",
    "we should note , also , that in the majority of experiments the evidence for the various classical and quantum transitions mentioned above was based on signatures in @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "this method is limited to addressing highly averaged quantities , and relies on substantial deviations of the investigated system from equilibrium ( needed , for example , to overcome the static pinning of vortices ) .",
    "recent developments in superconducting qubit techniques offer the possibility of overcoming the described limitations of previous experimental studies of many - body physics of vortices .",
    "typical superconducting qubit experiments address the superconducting system using microwaves.@xcite the system is only weakly perturbed by the microwave excitation ; hence , this spectroscopic approach allows one to probe the system close to equilibrium . on the circuit element side ,",
    "the development of the fluxonium qubit,@xcite which combines a josephson junction with a superinductor@xcite ( i.e. , an element exhibiting high inductance and low capacitance ) opens avenues for studying quantum effects in superconducting arrays .    in this work ,",
    "we study theoretically a one - dimensional array consisting of superinductors and a chain of small josephson junctions as shown in fig .",

    "two parameters characterize such an array : the ratios of the josephson ( @xmath2 ) and inductive ( @xmath3 ) energies ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] ) , combined into a characteristic length @xmath4 and the ratio  @xmath5 of charging and josephson energies , which controls the quantum fluctuations . despite its simplicity , this model allows for a variety of phase transitions of a classical or quantum nature ( depending on the ratio @xmath5 ) as a function of the applied magnetic flux  @xmath6 per plaquette of the array .",
    "classically , for fixed @xmath7 , there is a critical magnetic field @xmath8 at which the system undergoes a transition from a homogeneous state with no persistent currents through the inductors to a state with static persistent currents . as a function of the characteristic length  @xmath9 , eq .",

    "these vortices correspond to _ kinks _ , meaning discontinuous jumps of height @xmath12 , in the node phase ( or node flux )  @xmath13 , see fig .",

    "repulsive interactions between kinks lead to a series of pinned commensurate phases with increasing @xmath6 . in the presence of quantum fluctuations , the number of kinks fluctuates and the initial transition at @xmath8 turns into a kt transition .",
    "this is followed by commensurate - incommensurate transitions between classical pinned phases and quantum liquid phases of floating crystalline cells of a kink lattice .",
    "each of the phases carries a `` fingerprint '' in the microwave absorption spectrum , as the nature of low - energy excitations is sensitive to the types of phases and the transitions between them .",
    "the microwave spectra also carry information about the crossover from classical to quantum critical behavior in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "yet another advantage of the spectroscopic approach is that it is a linear response to a weak perturbation . in this work",
