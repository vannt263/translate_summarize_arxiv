    "a large amount of research has been devoted to the task of defining and identifying communities in social and information networks , _",
    "i.e. _ , in graphs in which the nodes represent underlying social entities and the edges represent interactions between pairs of nodes .",
    "most recent papers on the subject of community detection in large networks begin by noting that it is a matter of common experience that communities exist in such networks .",
    "these papers then note that , although there is no agreed - upon definition for a community , a community should be thought of as a set of nodes that has more and/or better connections between its members than between its members and the remainder of the network .",
    "these papers then apply a range of algorithmic techniques and intuitions to extract subsets of nodes and then interpret these subsets as meaningful communities corresponding to some underlying `` true '' real - world communities . in this paper , we explore from a novel perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in large sparse networks , and we come to several striking conclusions that have implications for community detection and graph partitioning in such networks .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to most of the previous work on this subject , we look at very large networks of up to millions of nodes , and we observe very different phenomena than is seen in small commonly - analyzed networks .      at the risk of oversimplifying the large and often intricate body of work on community detection in complex networks ,",
    "the following five - part story describes the general methodology :    1 .",
    "data are modeled by an `` interaction graph . '' in particular , part of the world gets mapped to a graph in which nodes represent entities and edges represent some type of interaction between pairs of those entities .",
    "for example , in a social network , nodes may represent individual people and edges may represent friendships , interactions or communication between pairs of those people .",
    "the hypothesis is made that the world contains groups of entities that interact more strongly amongst themselves than with the outside world , and hence the interaction graph should contain sets of nodes , _",
    "i.e. _ , communities , that have more and/or better - connected `` internal edges '' connecting members of the set than `` cut edges '' connecting the set to the rest of the world .",
    "3 .   a objective function or metric is chosen to formalize this idea of groups with more intra - group than inter - group connectivity . 4 .   an algorithm is then selected to find sets of nodes that exactly or approximately optimize this or some other related metric .",
    "sets of nodes that the algorithm finds are then called `` clusters , '' `` communities , '' `` groups , '' `` classes , '' or `` modules '' . 5 .",
    "the clusters or communities or modules are evaluated in some way .",
    "for example , one may map the sets of nodes back to the real world to see whether they appear to make intuitive sense as a plausible `` real '' community .",
    "alternatively , one may attempt to acquire some form of `` ground truth , '' in which case the set of nodes output by the algorithm may be compared with it .    with respect to points ( 1)(4 ) , we follow the usual path . in particular , we adopt points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and we then explore the consequence of making such a choice , _",
    "i.e. _ , of making such an hypothesis and modeling assumption . for point",
    "( 3 ) , we choose a natural and widely - adopted notion of community goodness ( community quality score ) called _ conductance _ , which is also known as the normalized cut metric  @xcite .",
    "informally , the conductance of a set of nodes ( defined and discussed in more detail in section  [ sxn : related : lowcondalgs ] ) is the ratio of the number of `` cut '' edges between that set and its complement divided by the number of `` internal '' edges inside that set .",
    "thus , to be a good community , a set of nodes should have small conductance , _",
    "i.e. _ , it should have many internal edges and few edges pointing to the rest of the network .",
    "conductance is widely used to capture the intuition of a good community ; it is a fundamental combinatorial quantity ; and it has a very natural interpretation in terms of random walks on the interaction graph .",
    "moreover , since there exist a rich suite of both theoretical and practical algorithms  @xcite , we can for point ( 4 ) compare and contrast several methods to approximately optimize it .",
    "to illustrate conductance , note that of the three @xmath2-node sets @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 illustrated in the graph in figure  [ fig : conduct2 ] , @xmath4 has the best ( the lowest ) conductance and is thus the most community - like .",
    "-nodes sets that have been marked , @xmath4 has the best ( _ i.e. _ , the lowest ) conductance , as it has the lowest ratio between the number of edges cut and the number of edges inside .",
    "so , set @xmath4 is the best @xmath2-node community or the most community - like set of @xmath2 nodes in this particular network.,scaledwidth=50.0%,height=226 ]    however , it is in point ( 5 ) that we deviate from previous work . instead of focusing on individual groups of nodes and trying to interpret them as `` real '' communities , we investigate statistical properties of a large number of communities over a wide range of size scales in over @xmath0 large sparse real - world social and information networks .",
    "we take a step back and ask questions such as : how well do real graphs split into communities ? what is a good way to measure and characterize presence or absence of community structure in networks ?",
    "what are typical community sizes and typical community qualities ?    to address these and related questions",
    ", we introduce the concept of a _ network community profile ( ncp ) plot _ that we define and describe in more detail in section  [ sxn : ncpp : def ] .",
    "intuitively , the network community profile plot measures the score of `` best '' community as a function of community size in a network .",
    "formally , we define it as the conductance value of the minimum conductance set of cardinality @xmath6 in the network , as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "as defined , the ncp plot will be np - hard to compute exactly , so operationally we will use several natural approximation algorithms for solving the minimum conductance cut problem in order to compute different approximations to it . by comparing and contrasting these plots for a large number of networks , and by computing other related structural properties ,",
    "we obtain results that suggest a significantly more refined picture of the community structure in large real - world networks than has been appreciated previously .",
    "we have gone to a great deal of effort to be confident that we are computing quantities fundamental to the networks we are considering , rather than artifacts of the approximation algorithms we employ . in particular :    * we use several classes of graph partitioning algorithms to probe the networks for sets of nodes that could plausibly be interpreted as communities .",
    "these algorithms , including flow - based methods , spectral methods , and hierarchical methods , have complementary strengths and weaknesses that are well understood both in theory and in practice .",
    "for example , flow - based methods are known to have difficulties with expanders  @xcite , and flow - based post - processing of other methods are known in practice to yield cuts with extremely good conductance values  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "spectral methods are known to have difficulties when they confuse long paths with deep cuts  @xcite , a consequence of which is that they may be viewed as computing a `` regularized '' approximation to the network community profile plot .",
    "( see section  [ algo - notes - section ] for a more detailed discussion of these and related issues . ) * we compute spectral - based lower bounds and also semidefinite - programming - based lower bounds for the conductance of our network datasets .",
    "* we compute a wide range of other structural properties of the networks , _ e.g. _ , sizes , degree distributions , maximum and average diameters of the purported communities , internal versus external conductance values of the purported communities , etc .",
    "* we recompute statistics on versions of the networks that have been modified in well - understood ways , _ e.g. _ , by removing small barely - connected sets of nodes or by randomizing the edges .",
    "* we compare our results across not only over @xmath0 large social and information networks , but also numerous commonly - studied small social networks , expanders , and low - dimensional manifold - like objects , and we compare our results on each network with what is known from the field from which the network is drawn .",
    "to our knowledge , this makes ours the most extensive such analysis of the community structure in large real - world social and information networks .",
    "* we compare results with analytical and/or simulational results on a wide range of commonly and not - so - commonly used network generation models  @xcite .      * main empirical findings : * taken as a whole ,",
    "the results we present in this paper suggest a rather detailed and somewhat counterintuitive picture of the community structure in large social and information networks .",
    "several qualitative properties of community structure , as revealed by the network community profile plot , are nearly universal :    * up to a size scale , which empirically is roughly @xmath0 nodes , there not only exist cuts with relatively good conductance , _ i.e. _ , good communities , but also the slope of the network community profile plot is generally sloping downward .",
    "this latter point suggests that smaller communities can be combined into meaningful larger communities , a phenomenon that we empirically observe in many cases .",
    "* at the size scale of roughly @xmath0 nodes , we often observe the global minimum of the network community profile plot ; these are the `` best '' communities , according to the conductance measure , in the entire graph .",
    "these are , however , rather interestingly connected to the rest of the network ; for example , in most cases , we observe empirically that they are a small set of nodes barely connected to the remainder of the network by just a _ single _ edge .",
    "* above the size scale of roughly @xmath0 nodes , the network community profile plot gradually increases , and thus there is a nearly inverse relationship between community size and community quality . as a function of increasing size ,",
    "the best possible communities become more and more `` blended into '' the remainder of the network .",
    "intuitively , communities blend in with one another and gradually disappear as they grow larger .",
    "in particular , in many cases , larger communities can be broken into smaller and smaller pieces , often recursively , each of which is more community - like than the original supposed community . *",
    "even up to the largest size scales , we observe significantly more structure than would be seen , for example , in an expander - like random graph on the same degree sequence .",
    "a schematic picture of a typical network community profile plot is illustrated in figure  [ fig : intro_ncpp ] . in",
    "red ( labeled as `` original network '' ) , we plot community size vs. community quality score for the sets of nodes extracted from the original network . in black",
    "( rewired network ) , we plot the scores of communities extracted from a random network conditioned on the same degree distribution as the original network .",
    "this illustrates not only tight communities at very small scales , but also that at larger and larger size scales ( the precise cutoff point for which is difficult to specify precisely ) the best possible communities gradually `` blend in '' more and more with the rest of the network and thus gradually become less and less community - like .",
    "eventually , even the existence of large well - defined communities is quite questionable if one models the world with an interaction graph , as in point  ( 1 ) above , and if one also defines good communities as densely linked clusters that are weakly - connected to the outside , as in hypothesis  ( 2 ) above . finally , in blue ( bag of whiskers )",
    ", we also plot the scores of communities that are composed of disconnected pieces ( found according to a procedure we describe in section  [ sxn : obs_struct ] ) .",
    "this blue curve shows , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , that one can often obtain better community quality scores by combining unrelated disconnected pieces .    to understand the properties of generative models sufficient to reproduce the phenomena we have observed , we have examined in detail the structure of our social and information networks .",
    "although nearly every network is an exception to any simple rule , we have observed that an `` octopus '' or `` jellyfish '' model  @xcite provides a rough first approximation to structure of many of the networks we have examined .",
    "that is , most networks may be viewed as having a `` core , '' with no obvious underlying geometry and which contains a constant fraction of the nodes , and then there is a periphery consisting of a large number of relatively small `` whiskers '' that are only tenuously connected to the core .",
    "figure  [ fig : intro_graph ] presents a caricature of this network structure . of course",
    ", our network datasets are far from random in numerous ways_e.g .",
    "_ , they have higher edge density in the core ; the small barely - connected whisker - like pieces are generally larger , denser , and more common than in corresponding random graphs ; they have higher local clustering coefficients ; and this local clustering information gets propagated globally into larger clusters or communities in a subtle and location - specific manner .",
    "more interestingly , as shown in figure  [ fig : phicore ] in section  [ sxn : obs_struct : remove_whiskers ] , the core itself consists of a nested core - periphery structure .",
    "* main modeling results : * the behavior that we observe is not reproduced , at even a qualitative level , by any of the commonly - used network generation models we have examined , including but not limited to preferential attachment models , copying models , small - world models , and hierarchical network models . moreover , this behavior is qualitatively different than what is observed in networks with an underlying mesh - like or manifold - like geometry ( which may not be surprising , but is significant insofar as these structures are often used as a scaffolding upon which to build other models ) , in networks that are good expanders ( which may be surprising , since it is often observed that large social networks are expander - like ) , and in small social networks such as those used as testbeds for community detection algorithms ( which may have implications for the applicability of these methods to detect large community - like structures in these networks ) . for the commonly - used network generation models , as well as for expander - like , low - dimensional , and small social networks , the network community profile plots are generally downward sloping or relatively flat .",
    "although it is well understood at a qualitative level that nodes that are `` far apart '' or `` less alike '' ( in some sense ) should be less likely to be connected in a generative model , understanding this point quantitatively so as to reproduce the empirically - observed relationship between small - scale and large - scale community structure turns out to be rather subtle .",
    "we can make the following observations :    * very sparse random graph models with no underlying geometry have relatively deep cuts at small size scales , the best cuts at large size scales are very shallow , and there is a relatively abrupt transition in between .",
    "( this is shown pictorially in figure  [ fig : intro_ncpp ] for a randomly rewired version of the original network . )",
    "this is a consequence of the extreme sparsity of the data : sufficiently dense random graphs do not have these small deep cuts ; and the relatively deep cuts in sparse graphs are due to small tree - like pieces that are connected by a single edge to a core which is an extremely good expander . *",
    "a forest fire generative model  @xcite , in which edges are added in a manner that imitates a fire - spreading process , reproduces not only the deep cuts at small size scales and the absence of deep cuts at large size scales but other properties as well : the small barely connected pieces are significantly larger and denser than random ; and for appropriate parameter settings the network community profile plot increases relatively gradually as the size of the communities increases . * the details of the `` forest fire '' burning mechanism are crucial for reproducing how local clustering information gets propagated to larger size scales in the network , and those details shed light on the failures of commonly - used network generation models . in the forest fire model ,",
    "a new node selects a `` seed '' node and links to it . then with some probability it `` burns '' or adds an edge to the each of the seed s neighbors , and so on , recursively .",
    "although there is a `` preferential attachment '' and also a `` copying '' flavor to this mechanism , two factors are particularly important : first is the local ( in a graph sense , as there is no underlying geometry in the model ) manner in which the edges are added ; and second is that the number of edges that a new node can add can vary widely , depending on the local structure around the seed node .",
    "depending on the neighborhood structure around the seed , small fires will keep the community well - separated from the network , but occasional large fires will connect the community to the rest of the network and make it blend into the network core .",
    "thus , intuitively , the structure of the whiskers ( components connected to the rest of the graph via a single edge ) are responsible for the downward part of the network community profile plot , while the core of the network and the manner in which the whiskers root themselves to the core helps to determine the upward part of the network community profile plot . due to local clustering effects , whiskers in real networks",
    "are larger and give deeper cuts than whiskers in corresponding randomized graphs , fluctuations in the core are larger and deeper than in corresponding randomized graphs , and thus the network community profile plot increases more gradually and levels off to a conductance value well below the value for a corresponding rewired network .    * main methodological contributions :",
    "* to obtain these and other conclusions , we have employed approximation algorithms for graph partitioning to investigate structural properties of our network datasets . briefly",
    ", we have done the following :    * we have used metis+mqi , which consists of using the popular graph partitioning package metis  @xcite followed by a flow - based mqi post - processing  @xcite . with this procedure , we obtain sets of nodes that have very good conductance scores . at very small size scales",
    ", these sets of nodes could plausibly be interpreted as good communities , but at larger size scales , we often obtain tenuously - connected ( and in some cases unions of disconnected ) pieces , which perhaps do not correspond to intuitive communities . *",
    "thus , we have also used the local spectral method of anderson , chung , and lang  @xcite to obtain sets of nodes with good conductance value that that are `` compact '' or more `` regularized '' than those pieces returned by metis+mqi .",
    "since spectral methods confuse long paths with deep cuts  @xcite , empirically we obtain sets of nodes that have worse conductance scores than sets returned by metis+mqi , but which are `` tighter '' and more `` community - like . '' for example , at small size scales the sets of nodes returned by the local spectral algorithm agrees with the output of metis+mqi , but at larger scales this algorithm returns sets of nodes with substantially smaller diameter and average diameter , which seem plausibly more community - like .    we have also used what we call the bag - of - whiskers heuristic to identify small barely connected sets of nodes that exert a surprisingly large influence on the network community profile plot .    both metis+mqi and the local spectral algorithm scale well and thus either may be used to obtain sets of nodes from very large graphs . for many of the small to medium - sized networks",
    ", we have checked our results by applying one or more other spectral , flow - based , or heuristic algorithms , although these do not scale as well to very large graphs . finally , for some of our smaller network datasets",
    ", we have computed spectral - based and semidefinite - programming - based lower bounds , and the results are consistent with the conclusions we have drawn",
    ".    * broader implications : * our observation that , independently of the network size , compact communities exist only up to a size scale of around @xmath0 nodes agrees well with the `` dunbar number ''  @xcite , which predicts that roughly @xmath7 individuals is the upper limit on the size of a well - functioning human community .",
    "moreover , we should emphasize that our results do not disagree with the literature at small sizes scales .",
    "one reason for the difference in our findings is that previous studies mainly focused on small networks , which are simply not large enough for the clusters to gradually blend into one another as one looks at larger size scales . in order to make our observations",
    ", one needs to look at large number ( due to the complex noise properties of real graphs ) of large networks .",
    "it is only when dunbar s limit is exceeded by several orders of magnitude that it is relatively easy to observe large communities blurring together and eventually vanishing .",
    "a second reason for the difference is that previous work did not measure and examine the _ network community profile _ of cluster size vs. cluster quality .",
    "finally , we should note that our explanation also aligns well with the _ common bond _ vs. _ common identity _ theory of group attachment  @xcite from social psychology , where it has been noted that bond communities tend to be smaller and more cohesive  @xcite , as they are based on interpersonal ties , while identity communities are focused around common theme or interest .",
    "we discuss these implications and connections further in section  [ sxn : discussion ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sxn : related ] we describe some useful background , including a brief description of the network datasets we have analyzed .",
    "then , in section  [ sxn : ncpp ] we present our main results on the properties of the network community profile plot for our network datasets .",
    "we place an emphasis on how the phenomena we observe in large social and information networks are qualitatively different than what one would expect based on intuition from and experience with expander - like graphs , low - dimensional networks , and commonly - studied small social networks .",
    "then , in sections  [ sxn : obs_struct ] and  [ algo - notes - section ] , we summarize the results of additional empirical evaluations",
    ". in particular , in section  [ sxn : obs_struct ] , we describe some of the observations we have made in an effort to understand what structural properties of these large networks are responsible for the phenomena we observe ; and in section  [ algo - notes - section ] , we describe some of the results of probing the networks with different approximation algorithms in an effort to be confident that the phenomena we observed really are properties of the networks we study , rather than artifactual properties of the algorithms we chose to use to study those networks . we follow this in section  [ sxn : models ] with a discussion of complex network generation models .",
    "we observe that the commonly - used network generation models fail to reproduce the counterintuitive phenomena we observe .",
    "we also notice that very sparse random networks reproduce certain aspects of the phenomena , and that a generative model based on an iterative `` forest fire '' burning mechanism reproduces very well the qualitative properties of the phenomena we observe .",
    "finally , in section  [ sxn : discussion ] we provide a discussion of our results in a broader context , and in section  [ sxn : conclusion ] we present a brief conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will provide background on our data and methods . we start in section  [ sxn : related : networkdata ] with a description of the network datasets we will analyze .",
    "then , in section  [ sxn : related : clusters ] , we review related community detection and graph clustering ideas . finally , in section  [ sxn : related : lowcondalgs ] , we provide a brief description of approximation algorithms that we will use .",
    "there exist a large number of reviews on topics related to those discussed in this paper .",
    "for example , see the reviews on community identification  @xcite , data clustering  @xcite , graph and spectral clustering  @xcite , graph and heavy - tailed data analysis  @xcite , surveys on various aspects of complex networks  @xcite , the monographs on spectral graph theory and complex networks  @xcite , and the book on social network analysis  @xcite . see section  [ sxn : discussion ] for a more detailed discussion of the relationship of our work with some of this prior work .",
    "we have examined a large number of real - world complex networks .",
    "see tables  [ tab : data_statsdesc_1 ] , [ tab : data_statsdesc_2 ] , and  [ tab : data_statsdesc_3 ] for a summary . for convenience",
    ", we have organized the networks into the following categories : social networks ; information / citation networks ; collaboration networks ; web graphs ; internet networks ; bipartite affiliation networks ; biological networks ; low - dimensional networks ; imdb networks ; and amazon networks .",
    "we have also examined numerous small social networks that have been used as a testbed for community detection algorithms ( _ e.g. _ , zachary s karate club  @xcite , interactions between dolphins  @xcite , interactions between monks  @xcite , newman s network science network  @xcite , etc . ) , numerous simple network models in which by design there is an underlying geometry ( _ e.g. _ , power grid and road networks  @xcite , simple meshes , low - dimensional manifolds including graphs corresponding to the well - studied `` swiss roll '' data set  @xcite , a geometric preferential attachment model  @xcite , etc . ) , several networks that are very good expanders , and many simulated networks generated by commonly - used network generation models(_e.g .",

    "hierarchical clustering is a common approach to community identification in the social sciences  @xcite , but it has also found application more generally  @xcite . in this procedure , one first defines a distance metric between pairs of nodes and then produces a tree ( in either a bottom - up or a top - down manner ) describing how nodes group into communities and how these group further into super - communities . a quite different approach that has received a great deal of attention ( and that will be central to our analysis )",
    "is based on ideas from _ graph partitioning _  @xcite . in this case , the network is a modeled as simple undirected graph , where nodes and edges have no attributes , and a partition of the graph is determined by optimizing a merit function .",
    "the graph partitioning problem is find some number @xmath6 groups of nodes , generally with roughly equal size , such that the number of edges between the groups , perhaps normalized in some way , is minimized .",
    "let @xmath28 denote a graph , then the _ conductance _",
    "@xmath29 of a set of nodes @xmath30 , ( where @xmath31 is assumed to contain no more than half of all the nodes ) , is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath32 be the sum of degrees of nodes in @xmath31 , and let @xmath33 be the number of edges with one endpoint in @xmath31 and one endpoint in @xmath34 , where @xmath34 denotes the complement of @xmath31 .",
    "then , the conductance of @xmath31 is @xmath35 , or equivalently @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of edges with both endpoints is @xmath31 .",
    "more formally :    given a graph @xmath38 with adjacency matrix @xmath3 the _ conductance of a set _ of nodes @xmath31 is defined as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , or equivalently @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a degree of node @xmath43 in @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , in this case , the _ conductance of the graph _",
    "@xmath38 is : @xmath44 [ def : conductance ]    thus , the conductance of a set provides a measure for the quality of the cut @xmath45 , or relatedly the goodness of a community @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , it is often noted that communities should be thought of as sets of nodes with more and/or better intra - connections than inter - connections ; see figure  [ fig : conductance ] for an illustration .",
    "when interested in detecting communities and evaluating their quality , we prefer sets with small conductances , _",
    "i.e. _ , sets that are densely linked inside and sparsely linked to the outside .",
    "although numerous measures have been proposed for how community - like is a set of nodes , it is commonly noted_e.g .",
    "_ , see shi and malik  @xcite and kannan , vempala , and vetta  @xcite  that conductance captures the `` gestalt '' notion of clustering  @xcite , and as such it has been widely - used for graph clustering and community detection  @xcite .",
    "there are many other density - based measures that have been used to partition a graph into a set of communities  @xcite .",
    "one that deserves particular mention is modularity  @xcite . for a given partition of a network into a set of communities",
    ", modularity measures the number of within - community edges , relative to a null model that is usually taken to be a random graph with the same degree distribution .",
    "thus , modularity was originally introduced and it typically used to measure the strength or quality of a particular partition of a network .",
    "we , however , are interested in a quite different question than those that motivated the introduction of modularity . rather than seeking to partition a graph into the `` best '' possible partition of communities",
    ", we would like to know how good is a particular element of that partition , _",
    "i.e. _ , how community - like are the best possible communities that modularity or any other merit function can hope to find , in particular as a function of the size of that partition .",
    "in addition to capturing very well our intuitive notion of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good community , the use of conductance as an objective function has an added benefit : there exists an extensive theoretical and practical literature on methods for approximately optimizing it .",
    "( finding cuts with exactly minimal conductance is np - hard . ) in particular , the theory literature contains several algorithms with provable approximation performance guarantees .",
    "first , there is the spectral method , which uses an eigenvector of the graph s laplacian matrix to find a cut whose conductance is no bigger than @xmath29 if the graph actually contains a cut with conductance @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the spectral method also produces lower bounds which can show that the solution for a given graph is closer to optimal than promised by the worst - case guarantee .",
    "second , there is an algorithm that uses multi - commodity flow to find a cut whose conductance is within an @xmath47 factor of optimal  @xcite .",
    "spectral and multi - commodity flow based methods are complementary in that the worst - case @xmath48 approximation factor is obtained for flow - based methods on expander graphs  @xcite , a class of graphs which does not cause problems for spectral methods , whereas spectral methods can confuse long path with deep cuts  @xcite , a difference that does not cause problems for flow - based methods .",
    "third , and very recently , there exists an algorithm that uses semidefinite programming to find a solution that is within @xmath49 of optimal  @xcite .",
    "this paper sparked a flurry of theoretical research on a family of closely related algorithms including  @xcite , all of which can be informally described as combinations of spectral and flow - based techniques which exploit their complementary strengths . however , none of those algorithms are currently practical enough to use in our study .    of the above three theoretical algorithms , the spectral method is by far the most practical .",
    "also very common are recursive bisection heuristics : recursively divide the graph into two groups , and then further subdivide the new groups until the desired number of clusters groups is achieved .",
    "this may be combined with local improvement methods like the kernighan - lin and fiduccia - mattheyses procedures  @xcite , which are fast and can climb out of some local minima .",
    "the latter was combined with a multi - resolution framework to create metis  @xcite , a very fast program intended to split mesh - like graphs into equal sized pieces .",
    "the authors of metis later created cluto  @xcite , which is better tuned for clustering - type tasks .",
    "finally we mention graclus  @xcite , which uses multi - resolution techniques and kernel @xmath6-means to optimize a metric that is closely related to conductance .",
    "while the preceding were all approximate algorithms for finding the lowest conductance cut in a whole graph , we now mention mqi  @xcite , an _ exact _ algorithm for the slightly different problem of finding the lowest conductance cut in _ half _ of a graph .",
    "this algorithm can be combined with a good method for initially splitting the graph into two pieces ( such as metis or the spectral method ) to obtain a surprisingly strong heuristic method for finding low conductance cuts in the whole graph  @xcite .",
    "the exactness of the second optimization step frequently results in cuts with extremely low conductance scores , as will be visible in many of our plots .",
    "mqi can be implemented by solving single parametric max flow problems , or sequences of ordinary max flow problems .",
    "parametric max flow ( with mqi described as one of the applications ) was introduced by  @xcite , and recent empirical work is described in  @xcite , but currently there is no publicly available code that scales to the sizes we need .",
    "ordinary max flow is a very thoroughly studied problem . currently , the best theoretical time bounds are  @xcite , the most practical algorithm is  @xcite , while the best implementation is hi_pr by  @xcite .",
    "since metis+mqi using the hi_pr code is very fast and scalable , while the method empirically seems to usually find the lowest or nearly lowest conductance cuts in a wide variety of graphs , we have used it extensively in this study",
    ".    we will also extensively use local spectral algorithm of andersen , chung , and lang  @xcite to find node sets of low conductance , _",
    "i.e. _ , good communities , around a seed node .",
    "this algorithm is also very fast , and it can be successfully applied to very large graphs to obtain more `` well - rounded '' , `` compact , '' or `` evenly - connected '' communities than those returned by meits+mqi .",
    "the latter observation ( described in more detail in section  [ algo - notes - section ] ) is since local spectral methods also confuse long paths ( which tend to occur in our very sparse network datasets ) with deep cuts .",
    "this algorithm takes as input two parameters  the seed node and a parameter @xmath50 that intuitively controls the locality of the computation  and it outputs a set of nodes .",
    "local spectral methods were introduced by spielman and teng  @xcite , and they have roughly the same kind of quadratic approximation guarantees as the global spectral method , but they have computational cost is proportional to the size of the obtained piece  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the _ network community profile plot _ ( ncp plot ) , which measures the quality of network communities at different size scales .",
    "we start in section  [ sxn : ncpp : def ] by introducing it .",
    "then , in section  [ sxn : ncpp : low_small ] , we present the ncp plot for several examples of networks which inform peoples intuition and for which the ncp plot behaves in a characteristic manner",
    ". then , in sections  [ sxn : ncpp : large_sparse ] and  [ sxn : ncpp : large_sparse_more ] we present the ncp plot for a wide range of large real world social and information networks .",
    "we will see that in such networks the ncp plot behaves in a qualitatively different manner .      in order to more finely resolve community structure in large networks",
    ", we introduce the _ network community profile plot _ ( ncp plot ) . intuitively , the ncp plot measures the quality of the best possible community in a large network , as a function of the community size . formally",
    ", we may define it as the conductance value of the best conductance set of cardinality @xmath6 in the entire network , as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "given a graph @xmath38 with adjacency matrix @xmath3 , the _ network community profile plot ( ncp plot ) _",
    "plots @xmath51 as a function of @xmath6 , where @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath31 , and where the conductance @xmath54 of @xmath31 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : conductance_set ] ) .",
    "since this quantity is intractable to compute , we will employ well - studied approximation algorithms for the minimum conductance cut problem to approximate it .",
    "in particular , operationally we will use several natural heuristics based on approximation algorithms to do graph partitioning in order to compute different approximations to the ncp plot .",
    "although other procedures will be described in section  [ algo - notes - section ] , we will primarily employ two procedures .",
    "first , metis+mqi , _ i.e. _ , the graph partitioning package metis  @xcite followed by the flow - based post - processing procedure mqi  @xcite ; this procedure returns sets that have very good conductance values .",
    "second , the local spectral algorithm of andersen , chung , and lang  @xcite ; this procedure returns sets that are somewhat more `` compact '' or `` smoothed '' or `` regularized , '' but that often have somewhat worse conductance values .",
    "just as the conductance of a set of nodes provides a quality measure of that set as a community , the shape of the ncp plot provides insight into the community structure of a graph as a whole .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the conductance tells us how well clusters of different sizes are separated from the rest of the network . one might hope to obtain some sort of `` smoothed '' measure of the notion of the best community of size @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _ , by considering an average of the conductance value over all sets of a given size or by considering a smoothed extremal statistic such as a @xmath55-th percentile ) rather than conductance of the best set of that size .",
    "we have not defined such a measure since there is no obvious way to average over all subsets of size @xmath6 and obtain a meaningful approximation to the minimum . on the other hand",
    ", our approximation algorithm methodology implicitly incorporates such an effect .",
    "although metis+mqi finds sets of nodes with extremely good conductance value , empirically we observe that they often have little or no internal structure  they can even be disconnected . on the other hand ,",
    "since spectral methods in general tend to confuse long paths with deep cuts  @xcite , the local spectral algorithm finds sets that are `` tighter '' and more `` well - rounded '' and thus in many ways more community - like .",
    "( see sections  [ sxn : related : lowcondalgs ] and  [ algo - notes - section ] for details on these algorithmic issues and interpretations . )",
    "the ncp plot behaves in a characteristic manner for graphs that are `` well - embeddable '' into an underlying low - dimensional geometric structure . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider figure  [ fig : ncpp_lowdim ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : ncpp_lowdim : toy ] , we show the results for a @xmath56-dimensional chain , a @xmath17-dimensional grid , and a @xmath18-dimensional cube . in each case , the ncp plot is steadily downward sloping as a function of the number of nodes in the smaller cluster .",
    "moreover , the curves are straight lines with a slope equal to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the dimensionality of the underlying grids .",
    "in particular , as the underlying dimension increases then the slope of the ncp plot gets less steep .",
    "thus , we observe :    if the network under consideration corresponds to a @xmath58-dimensional grid , then the ncp plot shows that @xmath59    this is simply a manifestation of the isoperimetric ( _ i.e. _ , surface area to volume ) phenomenon : for a grid , the `` best '' cut is obtained by cutting out a set of adjacent nodes , in which case the surface area ( number of edges cut ) increases as @xmath60 ) , while the volume ( number of vertices / edges inside the cluster ) increases as @xmath61 .",
    "this qualitative phenomenon of a steadily downward sloping ncp plot is quite robust for networks that `` live '' in a low - dimensional structure , _",
    "e.g. _ , on a manifold or the surface of the earth .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : ncpp_lowdim : power ] shows the ncp plot for a power grid network of western states power grid  @xcite , and figure  [ fig : ncpp_lowdim : road ] shows the ncp plot for a road network of california .",
    "these two networks have very different sizes  the power grid network has @xmath62 nodes and @xmath63 edges , and the road network has @xmath64 nodes and @xmath65 edges  and they arise in very different application domains . in both cases , however , we see predominantly downward sloping ncp plot , very much similar to the profile of a simple @xmath17-dimensional grid . indeed ,",
    "the `` best - fit '' line for power grid gives the slope of @xmath66 , which by  ( [ eqn : slope_dim ] ) suggests that @xmath67 , which is not far from the `` true '' dimensionality of @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , empirically we observe that minima in the ncp plot correspond to community - like sets , which are occasionally nested .",
    "this corresponds to hierarchical community organization .",
    "for example , the nodes giving the dip at @xmath68 are included in the nodes giving the dip at @xmath69 , while dips at @xmath70 and @xmath71 are both included in the dip at @xmath72 .    in a similar manner ,",
    "figure  [ fig : phimodels : manifold ] shows the profile plot for a graph generated from a `` swiss roll '' dataset which is commonly examined in the manifold and machine learning literature  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we still observe a downward sloping ncp plot that corresponds to internal dimensionally of the manifold ( 2 in this case ) .",
    "finally , figures  [ fig : phimodels : expander1 ] and  [ fig : phimodels : expander2 ] show ncp plots for two graphs that are very good expanders .",
    "the first is a @xmath73 graph with @xmath74 nodes and a number of edges such that the average degree is @xmath75 , @xmath27 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the second is a constant degree expander : to make one with degree @xmath58 , we take the union of @xmath58 disjoint but otherwise random complete matchings , and we have plotted the results for @xmath77 . in both of these cases ,",
    "the ncp plot is roughly flat , which we also observed in figure  [ fig : ncpp_lowdim : toy ] for a clique , which is to be expected since the minimum conductance cut in the entire graph can not be too small for a good expander  @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly ( especially when compared with large networks in section  [ sxn : ncpp : large_sparse ] ) , a steadily decreasing downward ncp plot is seen for small social networks that have been extensively studied in validating community detection algorithms .",
    "several examples are shown in figures  [ fig : ncpp_small ] .",
    "for these networks , the interpretation is similar to that for the low - dimensional networks : the downward slope indicates that as potential communities get larger and larger , there are relatively more intra - edges than inter - edges ; and empirically we observe that local minima in the ncp plot correspond to sets of nodes that are plausible communities .",
    "consider , _",
    "e.g. _ , zachary s karate club  @xcite network ( zacharykarate ) , an extensively - analyzed social network  @xcite .",
    "the network has @xmath78 nodes , each of which represents a member of a karate club , and @xmath79 edges , each of which represent a friendship tie between two members .",
    "figure  [ fig : ncpp_small : karate_graph ] depicts the karate club network , and figure  [ fig : ncpp_small : karate_plot ] shows its ncp plot .",
    "there are two local minima in the plot : the first dip at @xmath80 corresponds to the cut @xmath3 , and the second dip at @xmath81 corresponds to cut @xmath4 .",
    "note that cut @xmath4 , which separates the graph roughly in half , has better conductance value than cut @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds with the intuition about the ncp plot derived from studying low - dimensional graphs .",
    "note also that the karate network corresponds well with the intuitive notion of a community , where nodes of the community are densely linked among themselves and there are few edges between nodes of different communities .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     thus , intuitively , one can think of small well - separated communities  those below the @xmath82 size scale that consist of subsets of the small trees  starting to grow , and as they pass the @xmath82 size scale and become bigger and bigger , they blend in more and more with the central part of the network , which ( since it exhibits certain expander - like properties ) does not have particularly well - defined communities .",
    "note ( more generally ) that if there are @xmath82 nodes in the small tree at the top of the graph , then the dip in the ncp plot in figure  [ fig : models_clique2 ] is of depth @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath84 then the depth of this cut is @xmath85 .    intuitively , the ncp plot increases since the `` cost '' per edge for every additional edge inside a cluster increases with the size of the cluster .",
    "for example , in cut @xmath3 in figure  [ fig : models_clique1 ] , the `` price '' for having @xmath18 internal edges is to cut @xmath27 edges , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 edges cut per edge inside . to expand the cluster by just a single edge",
    ", one has to move one level down in the tree ( toward the cut @xmath4 ) where now the price for a single edge is @xmath75 edges , and so on .",
    "the question arises now as to whether we can find a simple generative model that can explain both the existence of small well - separated whisker - like clusters and also an expander - like core whose best clusters get gradually worse as the purported communities increase in size .",
    "intuitively , a satisfactory network generation model must successfully take into account the following two mechanisms :    * the model should produce a relatively large number of relatively small  but still large when compared to random graphs ",
    "well connected and distinct whisker - like communities .",
    "( this should reproduce the downward part of the community profile plot and the minimum at small size scales . ) * the model should produce a large expander - like core , which may be thought of as consisting of intermingled communities , perhaps growing out from the whisker - like communities , the boundaries of which get less and less well - defined as the communities get larger and larger and as they gradually blend in with rest of the network .",
    "( this should reproduce the gradual upward sloping part of the community profile plot . )    the so - called _ forest fire model _",
    "@xcite captures exactly these two competing phenomena .",
    "the forest fire model is a model of graph generation ( that generates directed graphs  an effect we will ignore ) in which new edges are added via a recursive `` burning '' mechanism in an epidemic - like fashion . since the details of the recursive burning process are critical for the model s success , we explain it in some detail .    to describe the forest fire model of  @xcite , let us fix two parameters , a _",
    "forward burning probability _ @xmath86 and a _ backward burning probability _ @xmath87 .",
    "we start the entire process with a single node , and at each time step @xmath88 , we consider a new node @xmath32 that joins the graph @xmath89 constructed thus far .",
    "the node @xmath32 forms out - links to nodes in @xmath89 as follows :    * node @xmath32 first choose a node @xmath90 , which we will refer to as a `` seed '' node or an `` ambassador '' node , uniformly at random and forms a link to @xmath90 .",
    "* node @xmath32 selects @xmath91 out - links and @xmath92 in - links of @xmath90 that have not yet been visited .",
    "( @xmath91 and @xmath92 are two geometrically distributed random numbers with means @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "if not enough in - links or out - links are available , then @xmath32 selects as many as possible . )",
    "let @xmath95 denote the nodes at the other ends of these selected links .",
    "* node @xmath32 forms out - links to @xmath95 , and then applied step  ( ii ) recursively to each of the @xmath95 , except that nodes can not be visited a second time during the process .",
    "thus , burning of links in the forest fire model begins at node @xmath90 , spreads to @xmath95 , and proceeds recursively until the process dies out .",
    "one can view such a process intuitively as corresponding to a model in which a person comes to the party and first meets an ambassador who then introduces him or her around .",
    "if the person creates a small number of friendships these will likely be from the ambassadors `` community , '' but if the person happens to create many friendships then these will likely go outside the ambassador s circle of friends .",
    "this way , the ambassador s community might gradually get intermingled with the rest of the network .",

    "first , although many nodes might form one or a small number of links , certain nodes can produce large conflagrations , burning many edges and thus forming a large number of out - links before the process ends .",
    "such nodes will help generate a skewed out - degree distribution , and they will also serve as `` bridges '' that connect formerly disparate parts of the network",
    ". this will help make the ncp plot gradually increase .",
    "second , there is a locality structure in that as each new node @xmath32 arrives over time , it is assigned a `` center of gravity '' in some part of the network , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the ambassador node @xmath90 , and the manner in which new links are added depends sensitively on the local graph structure around node @xmath90 . not only does the probability of linking to other nodes decrease rapidly with distance to the current ambassador , but because of the recursive process regions with a higher density of links tend to attract new links .",
    "figure  [ fig : forestfire ] illustrates this .",
    "initially , there is a small community around node @xmath90 .",
    "then , node @xmath32 joins and using the forest fire mechanism locally attaches to nodes in the neighborhood of seed node @xmath90 .",
    "the growth of the community around @xmath90 corresponds to downward part of the ncp plot .",

    ".    next , also notice that if @xmath86 is too low or too high , then we obtain qualitatively different results .",
    "for example , if @xmath104 , then the community profile plot gradually decreases for nearly the entire plot . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "the forest fire does not spread well since the forward burning probability is too small , the network is extremely sparse and is tree - like with just a few extra edges , and so we get large well separated `` communities '' that get better as they get larger . on the other hand , when burning probability is too high , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath105 , then the ncp plot has a minimum and then rises extremely rapidly . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "if a node which initially attached to a whisker successfully burns into the core , then it quickly establishes many successful connections to other nodes in the core .",
    "thus , the network has relatively large whiskers that failed to establish such a connection and a very expander - like core , with no intermediate region , and the increase in the community profile plot is quite abrupt .",
    "we have examined numerous other properties of the graphs generated by the forest fire model and have found them to be broadly consistent with the social and information networks we have examined .",
    "one property , however , that is of particular interest is what the whiskers look like .",
    "figure  [ fig : whiskff ] shows an example of several whiskers generated by the forest fire model if we choose @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "they are larger and more well - structured than the tree - like whiskers from the random graph model of section  [ sxn : models : sparse_gw ] .",
    "also notice that they all look plausibly community - like with a core of the nodes densely linked among themselves and the bridge edge then connects the whisker to the rest of the network .     and @xmath98 .",

    "i.e. _ , models in which a hierarchy is given and the linkage probability between pairs of nodes decreases as a function of their distance in the hierarchy  @xcite . the motivation for this comes largely from the intuition that nodes in social networks and are joined in to small relatively tight groups that are then further join into larger groups , and so on . as figures  [ fig : phimodels : bh ] and  [ fig : phimodels : cga ] make clear , however , such models do not immediately lead to community structure similar to what we have observed and which has been reproduced by the forest fire model . on the other hand , although there are significant differences between hierarchical models and the forest fire model ,  @xcite notes that there are similarities .",
    "in particular , in the forest fire model a new node @xmath32 is assigned an ambassador @xmath90 as an entry point to the network . this is analogous to a child having a parent in the hierarchy which helps to determine how that node links to the remainder of the network .",
    "similarly , many hierarchical models have a connection probability that decreases exponentially in the hierarchical tree distance . in the forest fire model ,",
    "the probability that a node @xmath32 will burn along a particular path to another node @xmath108 is exponentially small in the path length , although the analogy is not perfect since there may exist many possible paths .",
    "in this section , we discuss several aspects of our main results in a broader context . in particular , in section  [ sxn : discussion : ground_truth ] , we compare to several data sets",
    "in which there is some notion of `` ground truth '' community and we also describe several broader non - technical implications of our results .",
    "then , in section  [ sxn : discussion : community ] , we describe recent work on community detection and identification . finally , in section  [ sxn : discussion : technical ]",
    ", we discuss several technical and algorithmic issues and questions raised by our work .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the relationship between network communities of the sort we have been discussing so far and some notion of `` ground truth . ''",
    "when considering a real network , one hopes that the output of a community finding algorithms will be `` real '' communities that exist in some meaningful sense in the real world . for example , in the karate club network in figure  [ fig : ncpp_small : karate_graph ] , the cut found by the algorithm corresponds in some sense to a true community , in that it splits the nodes almost precisely as they split into two newly formed karate clubs . in this section ,",
    "we take a different approach : we take networks in which there are explicitly defined communities , and we examine how well these communities are separated from the rest of the network . in particular , we examine a minimum conductance profile of several network datasets , where we can associate with each node one or more community labels which are exogenously specified .",
    "note that we are overloading the term `` community '' here , as in this context the term might mean one of two things : first , it can refer to groups of nodes with good conductance properties ; and second , it can refer to groups of nodes that belong to the same self - defined or exogenously - specified group .",
    "we consider the following five datasets :    * livejournal12  @xcite : livejournal is an on - line blogging site where users can create friendship links to other users .",
    "in addition , users can create groups which other users can then join . in livejournal , there are @xmath109 such groups , and a node belongs to @xmath110 groups on the average .",
    "thus , in addition to the information in the interaction graph , we have labels specifying those groups with which a user is associated , and thus we may view each such group as determining a `` ground truth '' community . * ca - dblp  @xcite : we considered a co - authorship network in which nodes are authors and there is an edge if authors co - authored at least one paper . here , publication venues ( _ e.g. _ , journals and conferences ) can play the role of `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "that is , an author is a member of a particular group or community if he or she published at a particular conference or in a particular journal . in our dblp network , there are @xmath111 such groups , with a node belonging to @xmath112 on the average . * amazonallprod  @xcite : this is a network of products that are commonly purchased together at amazon.com .",
    "( intuitively one might expect that , _",
    "e.g. _ , gardening books are frequently purchased together , so the network structure might reflect a well - connected cluster of gardening books . ) here , each item belongs to one or more hierarchically organized categories ( book , movie genres , product types , etc . ) , and products from the same category define a group which we will view as a `` ground truth '' community .",
    "items can belong to @xmath113 different groups , and each item belongs to @xmath114 groups on the average . * atm - imdb : this network is a bipartite actors - to - movies network composed from imdb data , and an actor @xmath3 is connected to movie @xmath4 if @xmath3 appeared in @xmath4 . for each movie",
    "we also know the language and the country where it was produced . countries and languages may be taken as `` ground truth '' communities or groups , where every movie belongs to exactly one group and actors belongs to all groups to which movies that they appeared in belong . in our dataset , we have @xmath115 language groups and @xmath116 country groups . * email - inside and email - inout  @xcite : this is an email communication network from a large european research organization conducting research in natural sciences : physics , chemistry , biology and computer science",
    ". each of @xmath117 members of the organization belongs to exactly one of @xmath118 departments , and we use the department memberships to define `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "although none of these notions of `` ground truth '' is perfect , many community finding algorithms use precisely this form of anecdotal evaluation : a network is taken , network communities are found , and then the correspondence of network communities to `` ground truth '' communities is evaluated .",
    "note , in contrast , we are evaluating how `` ground truth '' communities behave at different size scales with respect to our methodology , rather than examining how the groups we find relate to `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "furthermore , note that the notions of `` ground truth '' are not all the same  we might expect that people publish papers across several different venues in a very different way than actors appear in movies from different countries .",
    "more detailed statistics for each of these networks may be found in tables  [ tab : data_statsdesc_1 ] , [ tab : data_statsdesc_2 ] and  [ tab : data_statsdesc_3 ] .    to examine the quality of `` ground truth '' communities in the these network datasets , we take all groups and measure the conductance of the cut that separates that group from the rest of the network .",
    "thus , we generated ncp plots in the following way .",
    "for every `` ground truth '' community , we measure the conductance of the cut separating it from the rest of the graph , from which we obtain a scatter plot of community size versus conductance . then , we take the lower - envelope of this plot , _",
    "i.e. _ , for every integer @xmath6 we find the conductance value of the community of size @xmath6 that has the lowest conductance .",
    "figure  [ fig : explicitcmty ] shows the results for these network datasets ; the figure also shows the ncp plot obtained from using the local spectral algorithm on both the original network ( plotted in red ) and on the rewired network ( plotted in black ) .",
    "several observations can be made :    * the conductance of `` ground truth '' communities follows that for the network communities up to until size @xmath26-@xmath0 nodes , _",
    "i.e. _ , larger communities get successively more community - like . as `` ground truth '' communities get larger , their conductance values tend to get worse and worse , in agreement with network communities discovered with graph partitioning approximation algorithms .",
    "thus , the qualitative trend we observed in nearly every large sparse real - world network ( of the best communities blending in with the rest of the network as they grow in size ) is seen to hold for small `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "* one might expect that the ncp plot for the `` ground truth '' communities ( the green curves ) will be somewhere between the ncp plot of the original network ( red curves ) and that for the rewired network ( black curves ) , and this is seen to be the case in general .",
    "the ncp plot for network communities goes much deeper and rises more gradually than for `` ground truth '' communities .",
    "this is also consistent with our general observation that only small communities tend to be dense and well separated , and to separate large groups one has to cut disproportionately many edges .",
    "* for the two social networks we studied ( livejournal12 and ca - dblp ) , larger `` ground truth '' communities have conductance scores that get quite `` random '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are as well separated as they would be in a randomly rewired network ( green and black curves overlap ) .",
    "this is likely associated with the relatively weak and overlapping notion of `` ground truth ''",
    "we associated with those two network datasets .",
    "on the other hand , for amazonallprod and atm - imdb networks , the general trend still remains but large `` ground truth '' communities have conductance scores that lie well below the rewired network curve .",
    "our email network illustrates a somewhat different point . the ncp plot for email - inside",
    "should be compared with that for email - inout , which is displayed in figure  [ fig : phidatasets1 ] .",
    "the email - inside email network is rather small , and so it has a decreasing community profile plot , in agreement with the results for small social networks . since communication is mainly focused between the members of the same department , both network and `` ground truth '' communities",
    "are well expressed .",
    "next , compare the ncp plot of email - inside with that of email - inout ( figure  [ fig : phidatasets1 ] ) .",
    "we see that the ncp plot of email - inside slopes downwards ( as we consider only the communication inside the organization ) , but as soon as we consider the communication inside the organization and to the outside world ( email - inout , or alternatively , see email - enron ) then we see a completely different and more familiar picture  the ncp plot drops and then slowly increases .",
    "this suggests that the organizational structure , ( _ e.g. _ , departments ) manifest themselves in the internal communication network , but as soon as we put the organization into the broader context ( _ i.e. _ , how it communicates to the rest of the world ) then the internal department structure seems to disappear .",
    "in contrast to numerous studies of community structure , we find that there is a natural size scale to communities .",
    "communities are relatively small , with sizes only up to about @xmath0 nodes .",
    "we also find that above size of about @xmath0 , the `` quality '' of communities gets worse and worse and communities more and more `` blend into '' the network .",
    "eventually , even the existence of communities ( at least when viewed as sets with stronger internal than external connectivity ) is rather questionable .",
    "we show that large social and information networks can be decomposed into a large number of small communities and a large dense and intermingled network `` core''we empirically establish that the `` core '' contains on average @xmath119 of the nodes and @xmath120 of all edges .",
    "but , as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : phicore ] , the `` core '' itself has a nontrivial structure  in particular , it has a core - whisker structure that is analogous to the original complete network .    * the dunbar number : * our observation on the limit of community size agrees with dunbar  @xcite who predicted that roughly @xmath7 is the upper limit on the size of a well - functioning human community .",
    "moreover , allen  @xcite gives evidence that on - line communities have around @xmath121 members , and on - line discussion forums start to break down at about @xmath122 active contributors .",
    "church congregations , military companies , divisions of corporations , all are close to the sum of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we are thus led to ask : why , above this size , is community quality inversely proportional to its size ? and why are ncp plots of small and large networks so different ?",
    "previous studies mainly focused on small networks ( _ e.g. _ , see  @xcite ) , which are simply not large enough for the clusters to gradually blend into one another as one looks at larger size scales .",
    "our results do not disagree with literature at small sizes .",
    "but it seems that in order to make our observations one needs to look at large networks .",
    "it is only when dunbar s limit is passed that we find large communities blurring and eventually vanishing .",
    "a second reason is that previous work did not measure and examine the _ network community profile _ of cluster size vs. cluster quality .",
    "* common bond vs. common identity communities : * dunbar s explanation aligns well with the common bond vs. common identity theory of group attachment  @xcite from social psychology .",
    "common identity theory makes predictions about people s attachment to the group as a whole , while common bond theory predicts people s attachment to individual group members .",
    "the distinction between the two refers to people s different reasons for being in a group . because they like the group as a whole we get identity - based attachment , or because they like individuals in the group we get bond - based attachment .",
    "anecdotally , bond - based groups are based on social interaction with others , personal knowledge of them , and interpersonal attraction to them . on the other hand ,",
    "identity - based groups are based on common identity of its members , _",
    "e.g. _ , liking to play a particular on - line game , contributing to wikipedia , etc .",
    "it has been noted that bond communities tend to be smaller and more cohesive  @xcite , as they are based on interpersonal ties , while identity communities are focused around common theme or interest .",
    "see  @xcite for a very good review of the topic .    translating this to our context , the bond vs. identity communities mean that small , cohesive and well - separated communities are probably based on common bonds , while bigger groups may be based on common identity , and it is hard to expect such big communities to be well - separated or well - expressed in a network sense .",
    "this further means the transition between common bond ( _ i.e. _ , maintaining close personal ties ) and common identity ( _ i.e. _ , sharing a common interest or theme ) occurs at around one hundred nodes .",
    "it seems that at this size the cost of maintaining bond ties becomes too large and the group either dies or transitions into a common identity community .",
    "it would be very interesting as a future research topic to explore differences in community network structure as the community grows and transitions from common bond to common identity community .",
    "* edge semantics : * another explanation could be that in small , carefully collected networks , the semantics of edges is very precise while in large networks we know much less about each particular edge , _",
    "e.g. _ , especially when online people have very different criteria for calling someone a friend .",
    "traditionally social scientists through questionnaires `` normalized '' the links by making sure each link has the same semantics / strength .    * evidence in previous work : * there has also been some evidence that hints towards the findings we make here . for example , clauset _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed community structure of a graph related to the amazonallprod , and they found that around @xmath123 of the nodes belonged to the largest `` miscellaneous '' community .",
    "this agrees with the typical size of the network core , and one could conclude that the largest community they found likely corresponds to the intermingled core of the network , and most of the rest of the communities are whisker - like .",
    "in addition , recently there have been several works hinting that the network communities subject is more complex than it seems at the first sight . for example",
    ", it has been found that even random graphs can have good modularity scores  @xcite . intuitively , random graphs have no community structure , but there can still exist sets of nodes with good community scores , at least as measured by modularity ( due to random fluctuations about the mean ) .",
    "moreover , very recently a study of robustness of community structure showed that the canonical example of presence of community structure in networks  @xcite may have no significant community structure  @xcite .    * more general thoughts : * our work also raises an important question of what is a natural community size and whether larger communities ( in a network sense ) even exist .",
    "it seems that when community size surpasses some threshold , the community becomes so diverse that it stops existing as a traditionally understood `` network community . '' instead , it blends in with the network , and intuitions based on connectivity and cuts seem to fail to identify it .",
    "approaches that consider both the network structure and node attribute data might help to detect communities in these cases .    also , conductance seems like a very reasonable measure that satisfies intuition about community quality , but we have seen that if one only worries about conductance , then bags of whiskers and other internally disconnected sets have the best scores .",
    "this raises interesting questions about cluster compactness , regularization , and smoothness : what is a good definition of compactness , what is the best way to regularize these noisy networks , and how should this be connected to the notion of community separability ?",
    "a common assumption is that each node belongs to exactly one community .",
    "our approach does not make such an assumption . instead ,",
    "for each given size , we independently find best set of nodes , and `` communities '' of different sizes often overlap .",
    "as long there is a boundary between communities ( even if boundaries overlap ) , cut- and edge - density- based techniques ( like modularity and conductance ) may have the opportunity to find those communities .",
    "however , it is the absence of clear community boundaries that makes the ncp plot go upwards .",
    "a great deal of work has been devoted to finding communities in large networks , and much of this has been devoted to formalizing the intuition that a community is a set of nodes that has more and/or better intra - linkages between its members than inter - linkages with the remainder of the network . very relevant to our work",
    "is that of kannan , vempala , and vetta  @xcite , who analyze spectral algorithms and describe a community concept in terms of a bicriterion depending on the conductance of the communities and the relative weight of inter - community edges .",
    "flake , tarjan , and tsioutsiouliklis  @xcite introduce a similar bicriterion that is based on network flow ideas , and flake _ et al . _",
    "@xcite defined a community as a set of nodes that has more intra - edges than inter - edges .",
    "similar edge - counting ideas were used by radicchi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to define and apply the notions of a strong community and a weak community .    within the `` complex networks '' community , girvan and newman  @xcite proposed an algorithm that used `` centrality '' indices to find community boundaries . following this ,",
    "newman and girvan  @xcite introduced _",
    "modularity _ as _ a posteriori _ measure of the strength of community structure .",
    "modularity measures inter- ( and not intra- ) connectivity , but it does so with reference to a randomized null model .",
    "modularity has been very influential in the recent community detection literature  @xcite , and one can use spectral techniques to approximate it  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , guimer , sales - pardo , and amaral  @xcite and fortunato and barthlemy  @xcite showed that random graphs have high - modularity subsets and that there exists a size scale below which communities can not be identified . in part as a response to this , some recent work has had a more statistical flavor  @xcite . in light of our results , this work seems promising , both due to potential `` overfitting '' issues arising from the extreme sparsity of the networks , and also due to the empirically - promising regularization properties exhibited by local spectral methods .",
    "we have made extensive use of the local spectral algorithm of andersen , chung , and lang  @xcite .",
    "similar results were originally proven by spielman and teng  @xcite , who analyzed local random walks on a graph ; see chung  @xcite for an exposition of the relationship between these methods .",
    "andersen and lang  @xcite showed that these techniques can find ( in a scalable manner ) medium - sized communities in very large social graphs in which there exist reasonably well - defined communities . in light of our results ,",
    "such methods seem promising more generally . other recent work that has focused on developing local and/or near - linear time heuristics for community detection",
    "include  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this work we have cited , there exists work which views communities from a very different perspective .",
    "for example , kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite view communities as a dense bipartite subgraph of the web ; gibson , kleinberg , and raghavan  @xcite view communities as consisting of a core of central authoritative pages linked together by hub pages ; hopcroft _ et al . _",
    "@xcite are interested in the temporal evolution of communities that are robust when the input data to clustering algorithms that identify them are moderately perturbed ; and palla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite view communities as a chain of adjacent cliques and focus on the extent to which they are nested and overlap",
    ". the implications of our results for this body of work remain to be explored .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the relationship between our work and recent work with similar flavor in graph partitioning , algorithms , and graph theory .",
    "recent work has focused on the expansion properties of power law graphs and the real - world networks they model .",
    "for example , mihail , papadimitriou , and saberi  @xcite , as well as gkantsidis , mihail , and saberi  @xcite , studied internet routing at the level of autonomous systems ( as ) , and showed that the preferential attachment model and a random graph model with power law degree distributions each have good expansion properties if the minimum degree is greater than @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the empirical results , but as we have seen the as graphs are quite unusual , when compared with nearly every other social and information network we have studied . on the other hand , estrada has made the observation that although certain communication , information , and biological networks have good expansion properties , social networks do not  @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as evidence that such social networks have good small highly - cohesive groups , a property which is not attributed to the biological networks that were considered . from the perspective of our analysis , these results are interesting since it is likely that these small highly - cohesive groups correspond to sets near the global minimum of the network community profile plot .",
    "reproducing deep cuts was also a motivation for the development of the geometric preferential attachment models of flaxman , frieze , and vera  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the deep cuts they obtain arise from the underlying geometry of the model and thus are nearly bisections .",
    "consider also recent results on the structural and spectral properties of very sparse random graphs . recall that the @xmath124 random graph model  @xcite consists of those graphs on @xmath125 nodes , in which there is an edge between every pair vertices with a probability @xmath126 , independently .",
    "recall also that if @xmath127 , then a typical graph in @xmath124 has a giant component , _",
    "i.e. _ , connected subgraph consisting of a constant fraction of the nodes , but the graph is not fully connected  @xcite .",
    "( if @xmath128 , the a typical graph is disconnected and there does not exist a giant component , while if @xmath129 , then a typical graph is fully connected . ) as noted , _",
    "e.g. _ , by feige and ofek  @xcite , this latter regime is particularly difficult to analyze since with fairly high probability there exist vertices with degrees that are much larger than their expected degree . as reviewed in section  [ sxn : models : sparse_gw ] , however , this regime is not unlike that in a power law random graph in which the power law exponent @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "chakrabarti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite defined the `` min - cut '' plot which has similarities with our ncp plot .",
    "they used a different approach in which a network was recursively bisected and then the quality of the obtained clusters was plotted against as a function of size ; and the `` min - cut '' plots were only used as yet - another statistic to test when assessing how realistic are synthetically generated graphs .",
    "note , however , that the `` min - cut '' plots have qualitatively similar behavior to our ncp plots , _",
    "i.e. _ , they initially decrease , reach a minimum , and then increase .    of particular interest to us",
    "are recent results on the mixing time of random walks in this @xmath127 regime of the @xmath124 ( and the related @xmath73 ) random graph model .",
    "benjamini , kozma , and wormald  @xcite and fountoulakis and reed  @xcite have established rapid mixing results by proving structural results about these very sparse graphs . in particular",
    ", they proved that these graphs may be viewed as a `` core '' expander subgraph , whose deletion leaves a large number of `` decorations , '' _",
    "i.e. _ , small components such that a bounded number are attached to any vertex in the core .",
    "the particular constructions in their proofs is complicated , but they have a similar flavor to the core - and - whiskers structure we have empirically observed .",
    "similar results were observed by fernholz and ramachandran  @xcite , whose analysis separately considered the @xmath17-core of these graphs and then the residual pieces .",
    "they show that a typical longest shortest path between two vertices @xmath131 and @xmath32 consists of a path of length @xmath48 from @xmath131 to the @xmath17-core , then a path of length @xmath48 across the @xmath17-core , and finally a path of length @xmath48 from the @xmath17-core to @xmath32 . again , this is reminiscent of the core - and - whiskers properties we have observed . in all these cases , the structure is very different than traditional expanders  @xcite , which we also empirically observe .",
    "eigenvalues of power law graphs have also been studied by mihail and papadimitriou  @xcite , chung , lu , vu  @xcite , and flaxman , frieze , and fenner  @xcite .",
    "we investigated statistical properties of community - like sets of nodes in large real - world social and information networks .",
    "we discovered that community structure in these networks is very different than what we expected from the experience with small networks and from what commonly - used models would suggest .    in particular , we defined a _ network community profile plot ( ncp plot ) _ , and we observed that good network communities exist only up to a size scale of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "this agrees well with the observations of dunbar . for size scales above @xmath1 nodes ,",
    "the ncp plot slopes upwards as the conductance score of the best possible set of nodes gets gradually worse and worse as those sets increase in size .",
    "thus , if the world is modeled by a sparse `` interaction graph '' and if a density - based notion such as conductance is an appropriate measure of community quality , then the `` best '' possible `` communities '' in nearly every real - world network we examined gradually gets less and less community - like and instead gradually `` blends in '' with the rest of the network , as the purported communities steadily grow in size .",
    "although this suggests that large networks have a _ core - periphery _ or _ jellyfish _ type of structure , where small `` whiskers '' connect themselves into a large dense intermingled network `` core , '' we also observed that the `` core '' itself has an analogous core - periphery structure .",
    "none of the commonly - used network generation models , including preferential - attachment , copying , and hierarchical models , generates networks that even qualitatively reproduce this community structure property .",

    "<S> a large body of work has been devoted to defining and identifying clusters or communities in social and information networks , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , in graphs in which the nodes represent underlying social entities and the edges represent some sort of interaction between pairs of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> most such research begins with the premise that a community or a cluster should be thought of as a set of nodes that has more and/or better connections between its members than to the remainder of the network . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we explore from a novel perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in large social and information networks , and we come to several striking conclusions .    rather than defining a procedure to extract sets of nodes from a graph and then attempt to interpret these sets as a `` real '' communities , we employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as communities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we define the _ network community profile plot _ , which characterizes the `` best '' possible community  according to the conductance measure  over a wide range of size scales . </S>",
    "<S> we study over @xmath0 large real - world networks , ranging from traditional and on - line social networks , to technological and information networks and web graphs , and ranging in size from thousands up to tens of millions of nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been appreciated previously . </S>",
    "<S> our observations agree with previous work on small networks , but we show that large networks have a very different structure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we observe tight communities that are barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales ( up to @xmath1 nodes ) ; and communities of size scale beyond @xmath1 nodes gradually `` blend into '' the expander - like core of the network and thus become less `` community - like , '' with a roughly inverse relationship between community size and optimal community quality . </S>",
    "<S> this observation agrees well with the so - called dunbar number which gives a limit to the size of a well - functioning community .    however , this behavior is not explained , even at a qualitative level , by any of the commonly - used network generation models . moreover , it is exactly the opposite of what one would expect based on intuition from expander graphs , low - dimensional or manifold - like graphs , and from small social networks that have served as testbeds of community detection algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively gradual increase of the network community profile plot as a function of increasing community size depends in a subtle manner on the way in which local clustering information is propagated from smaller to larger size scales in the network . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that a generative graph model , in which new edges are added via an iterative `` forest fire '' burning process , is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets .    ' '' ''    ' '' '' </S>"
