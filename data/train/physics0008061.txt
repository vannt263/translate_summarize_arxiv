    "in the ctf ii drive beam gun , cs - te photocathodes are used to produce a pulse train of 48 electron bunches , each 10ps long and with a charge of up to 10nc @xcite . in ctf , the main limit to lifetime is the available laser power , which requires a minimal quantum efficiency ( qe ) of 1.5% to produce the nominal charge .",
    "although cs - te photocathodes are widely used , a complete understanding , especially of their aging process , is still lacking .",
    "spectra of the qe against exciting photons may help to understand the phenomenon .",
    "according to spicer @xcite , the spectra of the quantum efficiency ( qe ) of semiconductors with respect to the energy of the exciting photons ( @xmath0 ) can be described as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the threshold energy for photoemission , c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 are constants .      to measure the spectral response of photocathodes , wavelengths from the near uv throughout the visible are necessary . to attain these , an * o*ptical * p*arametrical * o*scillator was built @xcite .",
    "a frequency - tripled nd : yag laser pumps a betabarium borate ( bbo ) crystal in a double - pass configuration , as shown in fig.[fig : opo ] .",
    "the emerging signal - beam , with wavelengths between 409 nm and 710 nm , is frequency doubled in two bbo crystals .",
    "the wavelengths obtained are between 210 nm and 340 nm .",
    "the idler - beam delivers wavelengths between 710 nm and @xmath5 nm .    the measurements of the spectral response of photocathodes were made in the dc - gun of the photoemission lab at cern @xcite , at a field strength of about 8 mv / m .",
    "spectra were taken shortly after the evaporation of the cathode materials onto the copper cathode plug , as well as after use in the ctf ii rf - gun @xcite at fields of typically 100 mv / m .      to be able to interpret the spectra in terms of spicer s theory , it was necessary to split the data into 2 groups , one at `` low photon energy '' and one at  high photon energy  , see fig.[fig : cath87 ] .",
    "then , the data can be fitted well with two independent curves , following eq.([eq : spicer ] ) , which give two threshold energies . for a typical fresh cs - te cathode ,",
    "the high energy threshold is 3.5ev , the low one is 1.7ev , as shown in fig.[fig : cath87 ] , upper curve .",
    "this might be a hint that two photo - emissive phases of cs - te on copper exist .",
    "several explanations are possible : the copper might migrate into the cs - te , creating energy levels in the band gap ; or possibly not only cs@xmath4te , but also other cs - te compounds might form on the surface and these might give rise to photoemission at low photon energy . a hint to this",
    "might be that the ratio of evaporated atoms of each element is not corresponding to cs@xmath4te , see below .",
    "after use , we found that not only the complete spectrum shifted towards lower quantum efficiency , but also that the photoemission threshold for high qe increased to 4.1ev , which is shown in fig.[fig : cath87 ] , lower curve .",
    "one might expect that the photocathode is poisoned by the residual gas , preventing low - energy electrons from escaping .",
    "however , because typical storage lifetimes are of the order of months , the effect must be connected to either the laser light , or the electrical field .",
    "we also produced a cs - te cathode on a thin gold film of 100 nm thickness .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : cath120 ] , the shoulder in the low energy response disappeared .",
    "it is difficult to fit a curve for the spicer model to the low energy data .",
    "the  high \" photoemission threshold is at 3.5ev . at the moment , this cathode is in use in the ctf ii gun and will be remeasured in the future . in terms of lifetime , this cathode is comparable to the best cs - te cathodes , as it has already operated for 20 days in the rf - gun .      as a new material presented first in @xcite , we tested rubidium - telluride .",
    "we took spectra of qe before and after use in the ctf ii gun , as for cs - te .",
    "remarkably , with this material , there was no shift in the photoemission threshold towards higher energies , but only a global shift in qe , see fig.[fig : rb2te ] .",
    "this might be due to the lower affinity of rubidium to the residual gas .",
    "detailed investigations are necessary to clarify this .",
    "long lifetimes for cs - te cathodes are achieved only when they are held under uhv ( @xmath6 mbar ) .",
    "other photocathode materials like k - sb - cs are immunized against gases like oxygen by evaporating thin films of csbr onto them @xcite .",
    "therefore , we evaporated a csbr film of 2 nm thickness onto the cs - te .",
    "fig.[fig : csbr ] shows the spectrum before the csbr film ( square points ) and after it ( round points ) .",
    "the qe at 266 nm dropped from 4.3% to 1.2% .",
    "in addition , the photoemission threshold was shifted from 3.9ev to 4.1ev .",
    "a long - term storage test showed no significant difference between uncoated and coated cathodes .",
    "more investigations will determine the usefulness of these protective layers .      in order to increase the sensitivity of the on - line qe measurement during evaporation of the photocathodes",
    ", we monitored the process with light at a wavelength of 320 nm .",
    "we did not see any significant improvement in sensitivity , notably in the high qe region .",
    "film thicknesses are measured during the evaporation process by a quartz oscillator @xcite .",
    "typical thicknesses for high quantum efficiencies at @xmath7 nm are 10 nm of tellurium and around 15 nm of cesium .",
    "this results in a ratio of the number of atoms of each species of @xmath8 , far from the stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 for cs@xmath4te .",
    "it is known that tellurium interacts strongly with copper @xcite , so that not all of the evaporated tellurium is available for a compound with subsequently evaporated cesium",
    ". therefore , we used also mo and au as substrate material .",
    "however , the ratio between the constituents necessary for optimum qe , did not change significantly .",
    "another reason might be that instead of cs@xmath4te , cs@xmath4te@xmath9 is catalytically produced on the surface .",
    "this compound , as well as some others , was found to be stable @xcite .",
    "lifetime in ctf depends on parameters like maximum field strength on the cathode , vacuum and especially extracted charge .",
    "typically , a cathode is removed from the gun , if the qe falls below 1.5% .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : lifetime ] , lifetime does not depend on the initial qe ; a cathode having an initial qe of 15% ( round points ) lasted as long as one with 5% ( triangles ) .",
    "as shown in table[tab1 ] , the average current produced in ctf ii is nearly a factor 10000 lower than what is required for the clic drive beam .",
    "a test to produce 1mc is under preparation in the photoemission laboratory at cern .",
    "the exact reproduction of the clic pulse structure would require the clic laser , which is still in the design stage    .comparison of cathode relevant parameter [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    in a collaboration between rutherford appleton laboratory and cern .",
    "a test which is compatible with our current installation is the production of 1ma of dc current , which requires a uv laser power of 300mw at the cathode . for this test",
    ", we will illuminate the cathode with pulses of 100ns to 150ns pulse length , at repetition rates between 1khz and 6khz .",
    "as table[tab1 ] shows , this is a factor 1000 more average current than in ctf ii , and also demonstrates the basic ability of the cathodes to produce the ctf 3 drive beam ( i=26@xmath10a ) .",
    "clic is still a factor 75 away .",
    "we are currently searching for ways to produce higher charges as well .",
    "measurements of qe against photon energy are routinely made after production and after use of photocathodes .",
    "we have demonstrated that both low energy and high energy responses agree well with spicer s theory .",
    "a gold buffer layer reduces the low energy response of cs - te cathodes .",
    "more work is needed to understand the measurements of the stoichiometric ratio of cs - te .",
    "coating with 2 nm csbr significantly decreased the quantum efficiency , without improving the storage lifetime . for the high - charge drive beam of clic , it is still necessary to demonstrate the capabilities of cs - te , for which first tests will be done soon .",
