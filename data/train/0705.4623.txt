    "despite the wealth of attention that massive stars have received of late , their formation scenario is still largely unclear .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that massive stars form in clustered mode , deeply embedded in their natal molecular envelope where their development is optically obscured prior to main sequence evolution .",
    "this , coupled with the rapid timescales over which they evolve , as well as the fact that high - mass stellar candidates are typically at further distances than their lower mass counterparts , hinders the study of these objects .",
    "massive star formation regions are often found coincident with maser sources  in particular the methanol variant @xcite , uc hii regions @xcite , _ iras _ colour selected sources @xcite and _ msx _ colour selected sources @xcite .",
    "more specifically , methanol masers and uc hii regions are thought to feature prominently in the earliest stages of massive star formation ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "methanol masers have been found associated with strong radio continuum emission ( i.e. hii regions ) , _ iras _ far - infrared colour selected sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , h@xmath1o and oh masers @xcite as well as millimetre and submillimetre continuum emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .    early work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested that the methanol maser was indicative of the earliest stages of massive star formation prior to the onset of radio continuum emission .",
    "more recent work has focused on finding a precursor to the methanol maser , which would mark the _ very _ earliest stages of massive star formation .",
    "the hot molecular core ( hmc ) is one such object proposed to satisfy this criterion ( cf .",

    "* hereafter , paper i ) undertook a millimetre continuum emission survey toward regions displaying evidence of massive star formation in search of cold cores that would mark the earliest stages of their formation .",
    "this survey revealed evidence of star formation clearly offset from , and devoid of , both the methanol maser and radio continuum sources targeted .",
    "follow - up submillimetre observations of these ` mm - only ' cores ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) revealed each of them to be associated with submillimetre continuum emission and hence cold deeply embedded objects .",
    "combining the simba and scuba data from papers i and ii , together with existing submillimetre scuba data @xcite , as well as archival _ msx _ data where applicable and in some instances _ iras _ , we have drawn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) diagrams for the sources in our sample .",
    "the sed is drawn using a two - component levenberg - marquardt least squares fit according to equation [ chap : sed : eqfit ] . this relation models emission from a hot core embedded in a larger cold or warm envelope ( cf .",
    "@xmath2 + \\omega_c b_\\nu(t_{cold})\\ , \\epsilon_\\nu\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the flux density of the source , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the source solid angles for the hot and the cold component of the source , respectively , @xmath6 is the planck function for a temperature of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the emissivity for the cold component , which is equivalent to ( 1-e@xmath10 ) . for optically thin regions , @xmath9 approximates to @xmath11 where @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the dust grain emissivity index ( @xmath13 ) is assumed to be 2 for the sample , as per paper ii .",
    "sed fits were applied to 162 of the 405 sources in the simba sample ( see fig .",
    "m upper limits are indicated on the diagram .",
    "source specific parameters are as listed.,width=321,height=241 ]",
    "the sed fit provided three main parameters : the dust temperature , luminosity and the mass .",
    "these were then used to determine the hydrogen number density ( n@xmath14 ) , the surface density ( @xmath15 ) and the luminosity - to - mass ratio ( l / m ) .",
    "together with the radius and distance from our earlier work , eight parameters are known for each source .",
    "we have compared each of these eight parameters with respect to the four classes of source found in the sample ( see paper i ) through histogram and cumulative distribution plots ( see figures [ fig : hist ] and [ fig : cumul ] ) as well as kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests .",
    "analysis revealed @xcite the mm - only sample to be comparable in terms of mass and radii to sources harbouring a methanol maser and/or radio continuum source .",
    "intriguingly , the mm - only sample are also cooler and less luminous ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hist ] and [ fig : cumul ] ) with smaller luminosity - to - mass ratios than these sources .",
    "as well as corroborating these results , the ks tests for the temperature , luminosity and l / m indicate that the mm - only cores are distinctly different from the methanol maser and/or radio continuum associated cores for these parameters .",
    "at least 45 per cent of the mm - only cores are also without mid - infrared _ msx _ emission .",
    "these results are consistent with cooler , younger examples of massive star formation , suggesting that the mm - only core is indicative of the very earliest stages of massive star formation , prior to the onset of methanol maser emission .",
    "the mm - only sample was identified as comprising two populations which are distinguished by temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) . for the following analysis ,",
    "the mm - only sample was segregated into cool - mm and warm - mm components , creating five classes of sources in total .    according to the cumulative distribution plots ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bimm ] ) the cool - mm sources are less luminous with smaller l / m and radii , and higher densities ( n@xmath14 and @xmath15 ) than the warm - mm sources as well as those sources with a methanol maser and/or radio continuum source .",
    "the ks tests indicate that the cool - mm sources are not drawn from the same population as the warm - mm sources , nor the sources with radio continuum and/or methanol maser emission for the luminosity , luminosity - to - mass ratio , h@xmath0 number density and the surface density .",
    "however no such distinction could be discerned for the mass .",
    "the warm - mm sources on the other hand display little distinction from the methanol maser and/or radio continuum sources for all of the parameters tested .",
    "these results led us to conclude that the cool - mm and warm - mm sources are two distinct populations of the mm - only core .",
    "the cool - mm sources are the least luminous sources in the sample , with lower luminosity - to - mass ratios as well as higher h@xmath0 and surface densities .",
    "however they are of comparable mass and radii to the warm - mm and maser sources .",
    "we propose that the warm - mm sources are indicative of the earliest stages of massive star formation prior to the onset of methanol maser emission , whilst the cool - mm sources are examples of starless cores as described by @xcite .",
    "high resolution observations of these cores , to search for embedded sources , are necessary in order to ascertain which of them are forming stars , and which will remain starless , and so test this hypothesis .",
    "a caveat of this work is that the separation of the mm - only core into two distinct populations was concluded from a simple greybody fit to the sed , which enabled a temperature estimation in addition to the mass and luminosity of the dust cores",
    ". this distinction may be in error , a result of the limited number of data points available to fit the seds for these sources .",
    "ammonia ( nh@xmath16 ) is an excellent tracer of dense molecular gas .",
    "it can be used to probe the physical conditions of the molecular cloud in which cores are forming and can be used to determine physical conditions of the gas , such as temperature , density and optical depth ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "intriguingly , longmore et al .",
    "( this volume ) report observations where the youngest star formation regions in their sample are devoid of methanol maser emission , traced solely by their nh@xmath16 emission .",
    "we anticipate a direct correlation between future nh@xmath16 observations of our sample , with the millimetre continuum emission detected by simba , as per the results of @xcite .",
    "ammonia will therefore provide an independent determination of the temperature of our mm - only cores , with insights into their role in the formation of massive stars .",
