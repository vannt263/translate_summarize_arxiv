    "the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) collaboration has recently reported results of a first sensitive survey of the inner part of our galaxy in very high energy gamma - rays ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "this survey has revealed the existence of a population of fourteen tev objects , most of which were previously unknown .",
    "these findings have important astrophysical implications for our understanding of cosmic particle accelerators via tev measurements .",
    "various types of sources in the galaxy can act as cosmic accelerators : pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) , star forming regions and possibly binary systems containing a collapsed object such as a microquasar or a pulsar .",
    "indeed , four of these new tev sources ( hess j1640465 , hess j1713381 , hess j1813178 and hess j1834087 ) are spatially coincident with snrs , which have been mapped and studied at radio frequencies ( green et al .",
    "1999 ; green 2004 ; brogan et al . 2005 ; helfand et al .",
    "2005 ) ; in the first three cases x - ray radiation associated with the radio emission has also been reported ( sugizaki et al . 2001 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; ubertini et al .",
    "2005 ) , while in the last case no x - ray data has so far been published .",
    "three more sources , hess j1616509 , hess j1804216 and hess j1825137 , could be associated with energetic nearby pulsars , but their spatial offset from the tev emitting region is too large to make the association secure .",
    "other three objects are consistent with the 95% positional error contour of unidentified egret sources ( hess j1640465 , hess j1745303 and hess j1825137 ) ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , while two are located very close to a new class of highly absorbed hard x - ray binaries recently detected by _ integral _ ( hess j1632478 and hess j1634472 , walter et al .",
    "2006 ; lutovinov et al .",
    "another source ( hess j1837069 ) is related to x - ray emission of unknown origin detected by _",
    "asca _ and _ _ beppo__sax/_integral _ ( malizia et al . 2005 ) and may either be associated to a snr / pwn or belong to the class of absorbed hard x - ray binaries .",
    "the three remaining objects ( hess j1614518 , hess j1702420 and hess j1708410 ) have no plausible snr , pulsar , or egret counterpart and therefore it has been suggested in the literature that they belong to a new source type ( aharonian et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , it should also be remembered that the probability of chance coincidence in the crowded region of the galactic plane is quite high and therefore also for the other sources the reported associations must be verified carefully .    in the case of hess j1813178 and hess j1837069 , the existing x / soft gamma - ray data support at first glance the synchrotron / inverse compton scenario ( malizia et al . 2005 ; ubertini et al . 2005 ) , but , unfortunately , various attempts to model in detail their overall spectral energy distribution ( brogan et al .",
    "2006 ; albert et al .",
    "2006 ) have not been completely successful ( ubertini 2006 ) .",
    "the lack of radio / x - ray emission from some of the hess sources is particularly interesting as it strongly suggests that the accelerated particles may be nucleons rather than high energy electrons .",
    "however , the possibility that still undetected snrs or pwns are present inside the tev emitting region must be considered since a deep multiwavelength investigation of each hess source is still lacking . furthermore , the localization of any suggested x - ray / radio counterpart with sufficient precision to allow follow - up observations ( for example at optical / infrared frequencies ) is crucial in order to obtain secure identification and , in turn , to understand the nature of the tev emission . in this paper",
    ", we report on follow - up x - ray observations of seven of these hess survey sources with the _ swift_/xrt instrument .",
    "this study provides a list of x - ray objects detected inside ( or in the vicinity of ) the tev emitting region , their accurate arc - second location and information on their counterparts at other wavebands . for the brightest sources ,",
    "spectral information is also obtained in the x - ray band .",
    "to search for x - ray counterparts of hess survey sources we have used data collected with the xrt ( x - ray telescope , 0.210 kev ) on board the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "the log of all observations analyzed in the present paper is given in table 1 , where we report for each measurement the observation date , the pointing coordinates and the exposure time .",
    "data reduction was performed using the xrtdas v2.4 standard data pipeline package ( xrtpipeline v. 0.10.3 ) , in order to produce screened event files .",
    "all data were extracted only in the photon counting ( pc ) mode ( hill et al .",
    "2004 ) , adopting the standard grade filtering ( 012 for pc ) according to the xrt nomenclature . for each observation an image in the 0.310 kev band was obtained and analyzed .",
    "sources detected above 3@xmath0 confidence level are listed in table 2 , where we report for each detection its location , count rate ( 0.210 kev ) , error box radius and 210 kev flux corrected for absorption .    only in one case , that of hess j1303631",
    ", we do not detect any source in the xrt image ; this is in substantial agreement with _",
    "results from mukherjee & halpern ( 2005 ) since the only source they reported is too weak ( 210 kev flux of @xmath14 @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) for a meaningful detection by xrt in a short exposure ( 4.7 ks ) . in the case of hess j1813178 ,",
    "the image was corrupted ( see dedicated section ) , but this did not prevent the localization and analysis of the only x - ray source present in the field .    each x - ray source",
    "detected has been tested against the instrument point spread function , in order to assess if it was point - like or diffuse : none of the detected sources has a profile indicative of diffuse emission . only for the most interesting objects",
    "has a refined position and error box been estimated using the method reported in moretti et al .",
    "the radius of the error boxes associated with these xrt detections ranges from 3@xmath5 to 6@xmath5 ( see table 2 ) . within these error boxes ,",
    "we have searched the heasarc data base for optical / infrared counterparts of the most interesting objects . given the spatial association of four hess sources ( hess j1640465 , hess j1804216 , hess j1813178 and hess j1834087 ) with snrs and the possibility of using radio images from the nvss ( national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) sky survey catalog , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) or most ( molonglo observatory synthesis telescope , robertson 1991 ) to map their emission , we indicate the location of all x - ray sources detected in these four cases on the radio maps ( figure 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) ; in these radio images , the green circles indicate the position and size of the associated snr as reported in green ( 2004 ) , brogan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and brogan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in the remaining two cases ( hess j1614518 and hess j1837069 ) ,",
    "xrt images are presented instead ( figure 1 and 6 ) . in all figures , the red circle / ellipse represents the extension of the tev source as reported by aharonian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; x - ray sources are instead indicated by a box and/or a number as listed in table 2 .",
    "source spectral data were extracted using photons from a circular region of radius 20@xmath5 ; background spectra come from various uncontaminated regions near the x - ray source using a circular / annular region of various radius size depending on the presence of contaminating sources within the xrt field of view . in all cases ,",
    "the spectra were extracted from the events file using xselect software and binned using grppha in an appropriate way , so that the @xmath6 statistic could be used reliably .",
    "we used the lastest version ( v.008 ) of the response matrices and create individual ancillary response files ( arf ) using xrtmkarf .",
    "spectral analyses have been performed using xspec version 12.2.1 . due to the limited statistical quality of most spectra , we simply employed a power law absorbed by both a galactic ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and , when applicable , an intrinsic column density . in most cases only 210 kev fluxes",
    "have been estimated assuming a crab - like spectrum ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for a few sources with sufficient statistics ( @xmath7 5@xmath0 ) , we have performed a proper spectral analysis and the results are presented in table 3 .",
    "all quoted errors correspond to a 90@xmath8 confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the observational mode of xrt does not allow continuous monitoring of the source ; this , coupled with the low statistical quality of the data , makes a timing analysis unpractical .",
    "hess j1614518 is characterized by an extended and elongated morphology .",
    "this source , which is one of the two brightest tev objects detected in the hess survey , is located in a region relatively poor in counterpart candidates .",
    "observation of the nearby sky ( 10@xmath10 away ) did not show evidence for x - ray emission ( kastner et al .",
    "the xrt observation , which instead covers the entire hess emitting region ( see figure 1 ) , indicates that only two faint x - ray sources are present inside or close to the hess ellipse .",
    "due to the weakness of both sources , no spectral analysis is possible and only a flux has been extracted .",
    "source 1 has a usno - b1.0 ( monet et al .",
    "1999 ) and 2mass ( two micron all sky survey , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) counterpart at r.a.=16@xmath1114@xmath12 06@xmath13.10 and dec=51@xmath14 52@xmath10 26@xmath5.4 ( j2000 ) , with @xmath15 @xmath169.9 and @xmath17 @xmath1612.5 ; the @xmath18 colour index of @xmath13 implies extinction in the source direction .",
    "source 2 is likely to be associated with a rass ( _ rosat _ all sky survey ) faint source ( rxs j161319.8514329 ) and has nearby ( 42@xmath5 ) a very bright and probably extended radio source ( pmn j16135143 ) characterized by a flux of 3.2 jy at 4850 mhz ( wright et al .",
    "1994 ) ; also in this case a usno - b1.0/2mass source is a possible counterpart of the xrt object with coordinates r.a.=16@xmath11 13@xmath12 20@xmath13.85 and dec=51@xmath14 43@xmath10 17@xmath5.4 ( j2000 ) and optical / infrared magnitudes of @xmath17 @xmath1611.6 and @xmath15 @xmath168.4 .",
    "the presence of such a bright radio source near object 2 and at the border of the tev emitting region is intriguing and we encourage further observations of pmn j16135143 , in order to understand its nature and possible association with hess j1614518 .",
    "hess j1640465 is marginally extended at tev energies and quasi - symmetrical in shape .",
    "the most promising counterpart is the broken shell snr ( g338.30.0 ) also detected by _ asca _ ( ax j16404632 ) with a 0.710 kev flux of @xmath1@xmath19 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 and a soft ( @xmath20 ) and absorbed ( @xmath21 @xmath3 ) x - ray spectrum typical of snr hot plasma emission ( sugizaki et al .",
    "the most 843 mhz radio image of this region ( see figure 2 ) provides insight into this snr clearly showing a broken shell - like structure .",
    "g338.30.0 is 8@xmath10 in diameter and is located in a complex region at 8.6 kpc distance ( guseinov , ankay @xmath22 tagieva 2004 ) ; the larger circle in figure 2 , which should provide its location and size , is slightly offset with respect to the snr , but this may be due to uncertainties in the source parameters and also to differences in images taken at different radio frequencies . despite this , it is unquestionable that the hess extension matches the snr structure quite closely .",
    "g338.30.0 is not very well studied as the radio spectral index is unknown and the 1 ghz flux is set around 7 jy with great uncertainty ( green 2004 ) .",
    "only one ( source 1 ) of the five objects detected by xrt is inside the tev extension .",
    "analysis of the x - ray spectrum of this source shows that it is fully compatible with that found by _ asca _ ( see table 3 ) , although an equally good fit is obtained with a flat spectrum ( @xmath23 ) , no absorption and a similar flux .",
    "this source is clearly the object detected by _ asca _ , but it is seen as point - like by xrt and localized with arc - second precision .",
    "source 3 , which is the brightest x - ray source in the region , is very soft , being undetected above 3 kev and characterized by a thermal bremsstrahlung emission with @xmath24 @xmath10.43 , while xrt data of source 2 are well described by an absorbed power law ( @xmath25 @xmath1@xmath26 @xmath3 ) with photon index @xmath27 @xmath11.8 ( see table 3 for both objects ) .    for the remaining two sources , the data are of too low statistical quality to allow spectral analysis and only a flux has been obtained .",
    "it is clear that the most interesting object coming out of this xrt observation is source 1 ; unfortunately , within its positional uncertainty we do not find any cataloged object in the heasarc archive , implying a very weak source at optical / infrared wavelengths .",
    "hess j1804216 is an extended source and it is spatially coincident with the south western part of snr g8.70.1 , which is located in the w30 complex .",
    "the morphology of this remnant is neither shell - like nor center - filled with `` plumes '' observed in the south part and along the western edge ; it has a radius of 22@xmath10.5 , a radio spectral index @xmath28 ( @xmath29 @xmath1 @xmath30 ) and a 1 ghz flux of 80 jy ( green 2004 ) .",
    "this snr may also be linked with the young radio pulsar psr j18032137 .",
    "both objects were observed by _",
    "rosat_/ipc and detected in soft x - rays : the pulsar is weak and characterized by a hard and absorbed spectrum , while the x - ray emission of g8.70.1 is brighter and diffuse ( finley & gelman 1994 ) .",
    "very recently , brogan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported the discovery of a new snr , which is located just inside the tev extension ( g8.310.9 ) ; it is a small ( @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 ) , shell - type snr with a radio spectral index @xmath34 in the range 0.60.7 and a 1 ghz flux around 12 jy .",
    "the nvss map of this region is shown in figure 3 , where we outline the two snrs , as well as the three x - ray sources detected by xrt : only two are located well inside the tev extension .",
    "sources 1 and 2 have already been detected in x - rays by _ rosat _ as a rass faint source ( # 1 , 1rxs j180404.6 - 215325 ) and wgcat / ipc object ( # 2 ) .",
    "source 3 has not been seen previously , but it is the one closest to a radio complex of unknown nature ( around 30 mjy in flux in the nvss catalog ) , which is possibly part of the w30 complex and it is just barely visible in the figure . within the positional uncertainty of this xrt source , we do not find any optical and/or infrared counterpart in the various heasarc catalogs .",
    "the xrt spectrum of source 1 is very soft , well described by thermal emission from optically thin plasma ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , and has no absorption in excess to the galactic one ( see table 3 ) , suggesting that it might originate from a bright star . indeed , within the xrt positional",
    "uncertainty , an object is found in the usno - b1.0/2mass catalogs with coordinates r.a.=18@xmath11 04@xmath12 03@xmath13.23 and dec=21@xmath14 53@xmath10 36@xmath5.5 ( j2000 ) and optical / infrared magnitudes of @xmath17 @xmath1612.1 and @xmath15 @xmath169.3 .",
    "the other two objects ( source 2 and 3 ) are not bright enough in x - rays to allow spectral analysis and only fluxes were extracted from the xrt data . within their positional uncertainties , we do not find any counterparts ; however , if we enlarge the error box of source 2 to @xmath35 , then a counterpart in a usno - b1.0/2mass catalogs is found at r.a.=18@xmath11 04@xmath12 00@xmath13.72 and dec=21@xmath14 42@xmath10 52@xmath5.4 ( j2000 ) , with magnitude @xmath17 @xmath1613.2 and @xmath15 @xmath1610.2 .",
    "hess j1813178 has been the target of various studies due to the initial lack of plausible counterparts ( aharonian et al .",
    "very recently , the magic experiment has confirmed the hess detection ( albert et al .",
    "this source is one of the less extended tev objects and has a spatial coincidence with a shell type supernova ( g12.820.02 ) recently detected in radio ( brogan et al .",
    "2005 , helfand , becker & white 2005 ) .",
    "this snr has a small extension ( 2@xmath10.5 in diameter ) , a radio spectral index @xmath28 and a 1 ghz flux of 0.16 jy .",
    "the hess source is also associated with an x - ray / gamma - ray emitting object ( ax j1813178 , igr j181351751 ) fairly bright in both these wavebands ( ubertini et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , the x - ray / gamma - ray error boxes are too large ( @xmath36@xmath37 ) to allow a proper localization of this source and therefore any relationship with the snr .",
    "the xrt image is highly contaminated by the presence of fringes in the   13@xmath12 35@xmath13.06 and dec=17@xmath14 49@xmath10 52@xmath5.4 ( j2000 ) ; this object has @xmath1611.8 and @xmath1616.7 magnitudes in the k and i bands respectively and it is not listed in the usno - b1.0 catalog , again indicative of strong extinction in the source direction .",
    "hess j1834087 is an extended tev source which has a positional coincidence with the snr g23.30.3 ( w41 ) characterized by a size of 27@xmath10 in diameter , and located at an estimated distance of 4.8 kpc .",
    "its radio spectral index @xmath34 is 0.5 similar to the other snrs , while the 1 ghz flux is 70 jy ( green 2004 ) .",
    "the 20 cm nvss radio image ( figure 5 ) clearly shows the snr broken shell with a hot spot at its center .",
    "the tev source is fully located within the shell structure and it is well associated with the central hot spot . very recently , the magic collaboration reported the detection of hess j1834087 and confirmed the extended nature of the tev emission ( albert et al .",
    "no x - ray data are yet available from this region .",
    "the present xrt observation pinpoints for the first time a faint x - ray source ( source 1 ) detected inside the hess extension and located close to the hot spot at the center of the snr .",
    "another two x - ray objects of similar brightness lie just outside the hess extension and only one of the two ( source 2 ) corresponds to a hot spot in the snr shell .",
    "all sources are too weak for spectral analysis and only an indication of the x - ray flux can be derived . within the xrt positional uncertainty of source 1",
    ", we find an optical counterpart belonging to the usno - b1.0 catalog and located at r.a.=18@xmath11 34@xmath12 34@xmath13.90 and dec=08@xmath14 44@xmath10 49@xmath5.6 ( j2000 ) , with magnitude @xmath17 @xmath1618.3 .",
    "this source , also listed in the 2mass catalog with @xmath15 @xmath1613 magnitude , is thus heavily reddened having an @xmath18 color index of @xmath15 .",
    "this hess source has an elongated shape and overlaps the southern part of the region of diffuse x - ray emission seen by _ asca _ ( bamba et al . 2003 , figure 1b ) ; xrt does not detect any diffuse emission , but locates the same ( within the instrumental accuracy ) point sources identified by _ _",
    "asca__. the northern part of the _ asca _ region , outside the xrt field of view , corresponds to g25.5 + 0.0 , whose nature is still unknown , although the x - ray emission indicates that it may be a shell - type supernova or a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the brightest feature in our image ( source 1 ) is the only source detected above 10 kev both by the _",
    "integral_/ibis and _ _ beppo__sax / pds instruments ( malizia et al . 2005 ) , but it is located just outside the hess extension ( see , however , aharonian et al .",
    "2005 for a discussion on its possible association with the tev object ) . despite the good localization provided by the _ einstein_/ipc instrument , the error box associated with this x / gamma - ray source has up to now been too large to provide a unique optical counterpart .",
    "source 1 is fully compatible with the _ asca_/_integral _ error boxes , but the xrt localization accuracy allows its positional uncertainty to be considerably improved and its counterparts to be searched at other wavebands .",
    "the xrt spectrum is slightly steeper than the _ asca _ one ( see table 3 ) , but compatible with the combined _",
    "asca_/_integral _ observed shape ( malizia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "only one source is found within the xrt error box from the usno - b1.0/2mass catalogs ( see table 4 ) ; it has @xmath18 @xmath16.7 , again suggesting extreme reddening . for the remaining objects detected within the xrt field of view , we find that five have an optical / infrared counterpart ( see table 4 ) ; of these objects only one ( source 7 ) is located inside the hess ellipse .",
    "unfortunately , sources from 2 to 9 are too faint to allow a proper spectral analysis of the xrt data and only fluxes are reported in table 2 .",
    "to provide a firm identification of lower energy counterparts to the large number of newly discovered hess sources , we have searched in the tev emitting region for the presence of _ swift_/xrt counterparts . for six of them ( see section 2.1 to 2.6 ) the search has been successful , with one or more x - ray sources accurately positioned within or in the close vicinity of the hess extension .",
    "however , before claiming that the same object or emission process is responsible for the x and gamma - ray emission , an assessment of the correctness of these associations must be performed . in particular , the random chance probability of finding an x - ray source within the hess extension must be properly evaluated .",
    "we can do this using the galactic logn - logs relation obtained by _",
    "asca _ in the 210 kev energy band ( yamauchi et al .",
    "2002 ) , always with the caveat that this assumes a uniform distribution of independent sources . out of the whole tev sample , only in the case of hess j1804216 , do we find that the two xrt objects detected are very likely due to random coincidence , while in all other cases the probability of finding an x - ray source inside the tev extension by chance is around 0.01 for hess j1640465 and hess j1813178 , 0.2 for hess j1614518 and 0.4 for hess j1834087 .",
    "the chance probability that the x - ray sources are background agns is even lower .",
    "we therefore consider the x - ray sources discovered in the first two cases as very likely counterparts of the tev objects . in the remaining two cases ,",
    "the x - ray sources are just interesting objects , which need a more in depth analysis . for the case of hess j1837069 , even though ax j1838.00655 is located slightly outside the ( 1@xmath0 ) hess extension , it is considered the most promising candidate counterpart ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) , although any firm conclusion on their association must await optical follow - up spectroscopy ; this is now possible with xrt location .",
    "an important result of the present study is also the arc - second localization of all x - ray sources , in particular for the most likely candidates .",
    "in fact , the precise localization allows in most cases to pinpoint the optical / infrared counterpart of the x - ray source , thus giving the possibility to assess its nature by means of follow - up observations , which will hopefully help establishing their association with the tev object .",
    "the main outcome of our follow - up work at x - ray wavelengths is the discovery that three of the detected x - ray sources are located at the center of a snr , which is spatially coincidence with the tev object : at least for hess j1640465 , hess j1834087 and hess j1813178 this evidence is clear in the radio maps ( see figure 2 , 4 and 5 ) and suggestive of a pulsar wind nebula type of association .",
    "so far , because of the limited time span and statistics of the present x - ray observations , it has been impossible to detect the timing signature of a pulsar in the detected objects .",
    "future work will therefore need to concentrate on more in depth studies of these sources at x - ray energies and on optical / infrared follow - up observations of their counterparts if we want to understand their nature and connection to the tev emission .",

    "<S> in order to provide a firm identification of the newly discovered galactic tev sources , a search for counterparts in a broad band from soft x - ray to soft gamma - rays is crucial as data in these wavebands allow us to distinguish between different types of suggested models ( for example leptonic versus hadronic ) and , in turn , to disentangle their nature . in this paper , we report the results of a set of follow - up observations performed by the _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on seven sources recently discovered by hess , in the range from few hundred gev to about 10 tev , during the inner galaxy survey ( aharonian et al . 2006 ) . in all , but one case , we detect x - ray sources inside or close - by the extended tev emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> all these putative x - ray counterparts have accurate arc - second location and are consistent with being point sources . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of our search is the discovery that three of them are located at the center of the diffuse radio emission of the supernova remnants , which have been spatially associated to these tev objects . </S>",
