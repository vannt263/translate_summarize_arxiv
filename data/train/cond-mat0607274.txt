    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices constitute an intense research activity both in experimental and theoretical physics . up to",
    "now this system has mostly been used for modelling the fundamental hamiltonians of solid state theory ( see , @xcite , for example ) where the number of particles is macroscopically large .",
    "however , the recent progress with manipulating a countable number of atoms @xcite makes it possible to build a system of arbitrary size , ranging from microscopic to macroscopic . in this border region between microscopic and macroscopic one has to deal with a finite number of atoms which , on the one hand , is too large to use the single - particle approach but , on the other hand , is too small to justify the thermodynamic limit . in the present work we theoretically analyse one of these problem related to superfluidity of a few ( @xmath0 ) bose atoms in a ring optical lattice @xcite with a few ( @xmath1 ) sites .",
    "it should be stressed in the very beginning that , currently , there are two different definitions of superfluidity in the physics literature .",
    "one definition is based on the system s responce to a phase twist . with respect to bose atoms in a lattice this approach",
    "is discussed , in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a method of how one can realize the twisted boundary conditions in a laboratory experiment is suggested in ref .",
    "the other definition originates in the landau criterion of superfluidity and involves a responce of a superfluid flow to ` wall roughness ' @xcite . in this work",
    "we try to reconcile both approaches . specifically , we address the following problem .",
    "assume that we have @xmath2 bose atoms in a ring lattice with @xmath3 sites in a superfluid state with given quasimomentum @xmath4 : @xmath5 we are interested in the time evolution of this state ( which we also shall refer to as the supercurrent state ) in the presence of a weak scattering potential and atom - atom interactions .",
    "we note that for a bec of atoms ( @xmath6 ) the problem of superfluid atomic current has been considered in a large number of papers ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , to cite few of them ) .",
    "the starting point of all these studies is the mean - field approach , which is sometimes rectified by taking into account the quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory predicts a destruction of the supercurrent as soon as the quasimomentum exceeds one quater of the reciprocal lattice constant ( @xmath7 in the notations used ) . in order to justify the mean - field approach in a 1d lattice the mean number of atoms per one site",
    "should be much larger than unity . as stated above , in the present work we focus on the opposite limit @xmath8 , where the mean - field approach is not applicable .",
    "for this reason we treat cold atoms in an optical lattice from a different viewpoint , in a sense closer to quantum optics than to condensed matter physics .",
    "the paper essentially consists of two parts ,  in the first part ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) , after a brief preliminary analysis , we report the results of numerical simulations of the system dynamics , and in the second part ( sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] ) we explain the observed regimes in terms of the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "the main results are summarized in the concluding sec .",
    "before proceeding with numerical simulations , we shall briefly discuss possible regimes for the atomic current .",
    "let us first consider the single - particle problem . in the tight - binding approximation",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the wannier functions , @xmath11 the hopping matrix element , and @xmath12 the random scattering potential . in what follows , to be concrete",
    ", we shall consider @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the operator @xmath15 couples the degenerate states with opposite quasimomentum , resulting in new eigenstates @xmath16 with an energy splitting @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fourier transform of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in course of time , an atom in a ring will periodically change its momentum to the opposite one with the frequency @xmath19 .",
    "it is worth of stressing that this periodic dynamics is exclusively due to the finiteness of @xmath3 and the assumed condition @xmath14 , which means that @xmath20 couples only the degenerate states of the unperturbed system .",
    "next we consider the multi - particle case , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operator , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the on - site interaction energy . using the canonical transformation , @xmath26 , it is convenient to present the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 if @xmath29 is a multiple of @xmath3 , and @xmath30 otherwise . for @xmath31 and @xmath32 the multi - particle eigenstates of the system ( [ 5 ] ) are the quasimomentum fock states @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "our state of interest corresponds to @xmath35 , where all atoms have one and the same quasimomentum .",
    "similar to the single - particle case , the random potential couples this state to the supercurrent state with the opposite quasimomentum @xmath36 , @xmath37 . however , now the coupling is indirect and involves the intermidiate states @xmath38 , as it immediately follows from the explicit form of the scattering potential in the momentum representation .",
    "thus the time evolution of the state @xmath39 is defined by the following @xmath40 matrix , @xmath41 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are the degenerate energies of the states @xmath43 and the next terms the transition matrix elements @xmath44 .",
    "the spectrum of the matrix ( [ 6 ] ) is equidistant with the level spacing @xmath45 .",
    "thus we have reproduced the result of the single - particle analysis , where the time evolution of the system is periodic with the frequency @xmath46 .",
    "now we switch on the interaction .",
    "then the intermidiate states @xmath43 aquire energy shifts @xmath47 , which appear to be @xmath48-dependent . using the first order perturbation theory",
    "we obtain @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ \\approx e_\\kappa + \\frac{un^2}{2l}+\\frac{u}{l}m(n - m ) \\;.",

    "we would like to note the analogy of the problem discussed with that for a bec in double well potential @xcite . drawing this analogy",
    "further we can estimate the minimal @xmath53 required for stabilization of the suppercurrent as @xmath54 for the sake of completeness we present a derivation of the estimate ( [ 9 ] ) in the next subsection ( which can be safely skipped if a reader is familiar with the subject ) .",
    "the standart method of treating the system ( [ 6]-[7 ] ) consist of mapping it onto an effective classical system ( terms proportional to the identity matrix are omitted ) , @xmath55 followed by a semiclassical quantization , where @xmath56 plays the role of planck s constant .",
    "the phase portrait of the system ( [ 8 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath59 is increased the phase portrait becomes similar to that of classical pendulum , with a separatrix separating the librational and rotational regimes .",
    "the maximal and minimal values of the classical action @xmath60 along the separatrix are given by @xmath61 .",
    "the quantum states , associated with @xmath60 , are decoupled only if they lie above the separatrix .",

    "this imposes the upper boundary @xmath74 on the interaction constant , which appears to depend on the quasimomentum @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , the state @xmath39 with the energy @xmath76 is an approximate eigenstate of the system only if @xmath25 is smaller than the characteristic energy gap separating it from the other energy states , coupled to @xmath39 by interaction . as the first guess one can set this gap to the mean level spacing , given by the inverse density of state @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath78 the density of states of ( [ 4 ] ) is given by the gaussian distribution ( see fig .",

    "further increase of the interaction constant ( results are not shown ) is reflected in even faster decay of @xmath91 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of low quasimomentum ( lower panel ) , where the current oscillations at @xmath86 change to persistent current at @xmath88 . here",
    "further increase of @xmath25 leaves the system dynamics qualitatively unchanged at least till @xmath94 .",

    "we shall come back to this point later on in sec .",

    "to get a better insight in the physics of the discussed phenomena we shall discuss the displayed in fig .  [ fig1 ] results in terms of the energy spectrum of the system ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we begin with the case of a high quasimomentum which , as mentioned above , refers to the central part of the spectrum .",
    "we have found that in the case of high initial quasimomentum a transition from oscillatory dynamics to irreversible decay is associated with the transition to chaos in the bose - hubbard model . following ref .",

    "it should be stressed that the presence of random potential in the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) alone does not yet induced chaos in the system .",
    "the only consequence of a weak disorder ( relevant to the spectral statistics ) is that it breaks the translational symmetry and , hence , we need not worry about decomposition of the energy spectrum into the independent subsets ( labeled , in the absence of a random potential , by total quasimomentum of the atoms @xcite ) .    the results of the statistical analysis of the high - energy spectrum are presented in fig .",

    "these distributions reflect the different character of the parametric dependence of the energy levels @xmath105 on some parameter in the hamiltonian ( @xmath106 in our case ) .",
    "namely , in the integrable case the energy levels may cross and , hence , one finds an arbitrary small @xmath107 . on the contrary , if the system is non - integrable , the energy levels show avoided crossings and probability of finding small @xmath107 tends to zero .",

    "namely , for a high quasimomentum @xmath83 the supercurrent exponentially decays as the interaction constant @xmath25 exceeds some critical value , while for a low quasimomentum @xmath84 the oscillatory behaviour of the suppercurrent changes to a persistent current .",
    "the explanation for these effects is found in the structure of low- and high - energy spectra of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "it is shown that the low - energy spectrum of the system is regular , and the positions of the energy levels can be found by using a bogoliubov approach . in contrast , the high - energy spectrum shows a transition from regular to a chaotic one if @xmath25 exceeds its critical value . using the results of the random matrix theory",
    ", we show that this transition is reflected in the exponential decay of the supercurrent with the decay constant proportional to @xmath184 .",
