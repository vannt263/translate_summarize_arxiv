    "the investigation of elastic and inelastic collisions between molecules and between molecules and atoms can provide valuable information about interactions , chemical properties and energy transfer dynamics [ 1 - 15 ] .",
    "the hydrogen molecule is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the universe s molecular clouds and plays an important role in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "for example , knowledge of the ro - vibrational excitation and de - excitation rate constants in molecular hydrogen collisions is of fundamental importance for understanding and modeling the energy balance in the interstellar medium .",
    "the energy transfer processes involving h@xmath0 molecules control the evolution of shock fronts and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) in the interstellar medium .",
    "additionally , the energy transfer between h@xmath0 molecules and between h@xmath0 and other atoms / molecules is important for cooling of primordial gas and shock wave - induced heating in the interstellar media .",
    "however , to accurately model the thermal balance and kinetics of such important systems one needs accurate state - to - state rate constants @xmath2 .",
    "experimental measurement of quantum state resolved cross sections and rates is a very difficult technical problem . on the other hand ,",
    "accurate theoretical data requires precise potential energy surfaces and reliable dynamical treatment of the collision processes .",
    "the first attempt to construct a realistic full - dimensional ab initio pes for the h@xmath1h@xmath0 system was done in works @xcite , and the potential was widely used in a variaty of methods and computation techniques .",
    "recently the h@xmath0@xmath3h@xmath0 system has been reinvestigated and an accurate interaction potential from the first principles has been developed in work @xcite .",
    "however , in this work the diep and johnson potential energy surface ( dj pes ) was extrapolated only for the rigid rotor monomer model of h@xmath0@xmath3h@xmath0 .",
    "an extensive study of the h@xmath0@xmath3h@xmath0 pes has been recently reported by boothroyd et al .",
    "@xcite , where the potential energies have been represented at 48180 geometries respectively with a large basis set at the multireference configuration interaction level .    in this work",
    "we provide a test of sensitivity for the new pess for collisions of rotationally excited h@xmath0 molecules @xmath4 we apply only the new surfaces mentioned above .",
    "the scattering cross sections and their corresponding rate coefficients are calculated using a non reactive quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach . in the next section",
    "we will briefly outline the method .",
    "our results and discussion are presented in section 3 .",
    "in this section we provide a brief outline of the quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach used in our calculations .",
    "all relevant details have been developed in works @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors .",
    "the model has been applied in few previous works , see for example @xcite . for the considered range of kinetic energies of astrophysical interest the rotor model",
    "is considered to be adequate @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for rotational excitation and relaxation phenomena can be obtained directly from the @xmath5-matrix .",
    "in particular the cross sections for excitation from @xmath6 summed over the final @xmath7 and averaged over the initial @xmath8 corresponding projections of the h@xmath0 molecules angular momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given by @xmath11 the kinetic energy is @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the total energy in the system , @xmath14 are the rotation constants of the colliding h@xmath0 molecules , @xmath15 is total angular momenta of the 4-atomic system , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the channel wavenumber and @xmath20 are rotational channel energies .",
    "the log - derivative matrix is propagated to large @xmath21-intermolecular distances , since all experimentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the asymptotic behaviour of functions @xmath22 .",
    "a set of coupled second order differential equations for the unknown radial functions @xmath23 is solved @xmath24 where @xmath16 .",
    "we apply the hybrid modified log - derivative - airy propagator in the general purpose scattering program molscat @xcite to solve the coupled radial equations ( [ eq : cpld ] ) .",
    "different propagator schemes included in molscat have been tested .",
    "our calculations showed that other propagators can also provide quite stable results .",
    "the numerical results are matched to the known asymptotic solution to derive the physical scattering @xmath5-matrix @xmath25 the method was used for each partial wave until a converged cross section was obtained .",
    "it was verified that the results are converged with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the matching radius , @xmath26 , for all channels included in our calculations .",
    "the relationship between the rate coefficient @xmath27 and the corresponding cross section @xmath28 can be obtained through the following weighted average @xmath29 where @xmath30 is precollisional translational energy at the translational temperature @xmath31 , @xmath32 is boltzman constant , @xmath33 is reduced mass of the molecule - molecule system and @xmath34 is the minimum kinetic energy for the levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 to become accessible .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , in this work we apply the new pess from works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dj pes @xcite is constructed for the vibrationally averaged rigid monomer model of the h@xmath0@xmath3h@xmath0 system to the complete basis set limit using coupled - cluster theory with single , double and triple excitations .",
    "a four term spherical harmonics expansion model was chosen to fit the surface .",
    "it was demonstrated , that the calculated pes can reproduce the quadrupole moment to within 0.58 % and the experimental well depth to within 1 % .",
    "the bond length was fixed at 1.449 a.u . or 0.7668 .",
    "dj pes is defined by the center - of - mass intermolecular distance , @xmath21 , and three angles : @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the plane angles and @xmath37 is the relative torsional angle .",
    "the angular increment for each of the three angles defining the relative orientation of the dimers was chosen to be @xmath38 .",
    "the bmkp pes @xcite is a global six - dimensional potential energy surface for two hydrogen molecules .",
    "it was especially constructed to represent the whole interaction region of the chemical reaction dynamics of the four - atomic system and to provide an accurate as possible van der waals well . in the six - dimensional conformation space of the four atomic system",
    "the conical intersection forms a complicated three - dimensional hypersurface . because the bmkp pes uses cartesian coordinates to compute distances between four atoms ,",
    "we have devised some fortran code , which converts spherical coordinates used in sec .",
    "2 to the corresponding cartesian coordinates and computes the distances between the four atoms . in all our calculations with this potential",
    "the bond length was fixed at 1.449 a.u . or 0.7668 as in the dj pes .",
    "a large number of test calculations have also been done to secure the convergence of the results with respect to all parameters that enter into the propagation of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this includes the intermolecular distance @xmath21 , the total angular momentum @xmath15 of the four atomic system , @xmath39 the number of rotational levels to be included in the close coupling expansion and others ( see the molscat manual @xcite ) .",
    "we reached convergence for the integral cross sections , @xmath40 , in all considered collisions . in the case of the dj pes the propagation has been done from 2 to 10 , since this potential is defined only for those specific distances . for the bmkp pes we used @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "we also applied a few different propagators included in the molscat program .",
    "now we present our results for different rotational transitions in collisions between @xmath43- and ortho-/ortho - hydrogen molecules ( [ eq : h2h2 ] ) .",
    "our main goal in this work is first : to carry out complete quantum - mechanical calculations with new potentials for different transitions in @xmath44-h@xmath0+@xmath44-h@xmath0 and @xmath45-h@xmath0+@xmath45-h@xmath0 collisions and , second , to provide a comparative study and check the sensitivity of the two newest surfaces for the very important and fundamental h@xmath0-h@xmath0 system .",
    "the energy dependence of the elastic integral cross sections on the total energy @xmath46 in the h@xmath0+h@xmath0 system is represented in fig .  1 ( upper plots ) together with the state - resolved integral cross sections @xmath47 for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 rotational transitions ( lower plots ) for both the bmkp and the dj pess respectively .",
    "as can be seen both pess provide the same type of the behaviour in the cross section .",
    "these cross sections are in basic agreement with recent time - dependent quantum - mechanical calculations in work @xcite . however ,",
    "our results show , that the dj pes generates about 30 % higher values for the cross sections relatively to the bmkp pes .",
    "also , it is important to point out here , that for comparison purposes we do nt include the compensating factor of 2 mentioned in @xcite .",
    "however , in fig .  2 ( left plot ) and in our subsequent calculations of the thermal rate coefficients , @xmath50 , the factor is included .",
    "significant differences in the cross sections of the two potentials are reflected in the state - resolved transition states @xmath51 , as shown in fig .  2 ( right panel ) .",
    "that is why it seems that the dj pes can provide much better results , as seen in the same figure in the left panel .",
    "specifically , when we present the results for the corresponding thermal rates @xmath52 calculated with the dj potential together with results of other theoretical calculations @xcite and @xcite the agreement is almost perfect . next , fig .",
    "3 provides the same results for the cross sections , but includes the details at low energies , together with the corresponding experimental data from @xcite .",
    "now one can better see the considerable differences in these two cross sections . however , the dj pes is able to provide very good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude , that dj pes is much better suited for the h@xmath1h@xmath0 system . moreover , in fig .",
    "4 we provide thermal rates for different transition states calculated with only the dj pes and in comparison with other theoretical data obtained within different dynamical methods and pess . again",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "20 rotational transition calculated with the dj and bmkp pess for the h@xmath0+h@xmath0 collision .",
    "the circles are some experimental data from the work @xcite , triangles up and triangles down are the results of this work using the dj and bmkp pess respectively . ]",
    "finaly , table 1 depicts the thermal rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 at lower kinetic temperatures , up to 10 k. numbers in each column should be multiplied by corresponding prefactor @xmath55 .",
    "as can be seen our results are in very good agreement with recent experimental and theoretical data at higher temperatures . however , at @xmath56 k we could not reproduce effectively the results of @xcite",
    ". it may be because of the interatomic ( h@xmath0-h@xmath0 ) distance restrictions in the dj surface in which the potential ranges from 2 to only 10 .",
    "it seems plausible , that for such low energies one needs to carry out calculations even beyond the 10 limit .",
    "we provide close - coupling quantum - mechanical calculations of the state - resolved rotational excitation and deexcitation cross sections and rates for molecular hydrogen collisions .",
    "a test of convergence and the results for cross sections and rate coefficients using two different potential energy surfaces for the h@xmath1h@xmath0 system have been obtained for a wide range of kinetic energies @xcite .",
    "our calculations revealed , that both pess can provide the same type of behaviour in regard to cross sections and rates for different transition states . however , significant differences in the cross section of the 00@xmath57 20 transition have been found . also , it was already indicated , that at even larger kinetic energies the dj potential overestimates relative to the bmkp surface the cross sections and rates by about 20 - 40 % @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the results of these calculations show , that additional work is needed to further improve the bmkp pes , particularly the part of the surface , which is responsible for the 00@xmath57 20 transition .",
    "we also found , as can be verified from table 1 , it is difficult to use the dj surface and carry out reliable calculations at temperatures lower than 30 k.    .thermal rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( m@xmath58s@xmath59 ) at low and very low temperatures calculated with the dj surface in comparison with available experimental@xmath60 and theoretical data from @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]"
