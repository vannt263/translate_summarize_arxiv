    "the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite consists in interference of parts of the electron wave function passing through two paths that contain a magnetic flux inside . in the originally considered situation @xcite the magnetic field is zero within the region accessible to electrons .",
    "the experiments are usually performed in a spatially homogenous magnetic field so the aharonov - bohm phase shifts are accompanied by magnetic deflection of the electron trajectories . in particular ,",
    "measurements performed for the young double slit experiment in vacuum @xcite indicate that the envelope of the interference pattern is shifted as due to the classical lorentz force . in solids",
    "@xcite the magnetic deflection of the electron trajectories can influence the results of the interference only provided that the larmor ( cyclotron ) radius is comparable to the width of the channels . for metal mesoscopic systems @xcite",
    "this condition is hardly fulfilled . in semiconductors",
    "the magnetic deflection of electron trajectories may be significant even for the width of the channels of the order of several tens of nanometers @xcite .",
    "recently , the magnetic deflection was used in the proposal @xcite of a solid - state setup for the interaction - free - measurement .",
    "the effects of magnetic forces were studied for the electron injection for semiconductor quantum point contacts @xcite and quantum rings @xcite . in two - terminal",
    "quantum rings @xcite the magnetic forces lead to a preferential injection of the electron to one of the arms of the ring ( i.e. to the left arm for @xmath0 ) . in consequence ,",
    "the parts of the electron wave function that meet at the exit to the output channel are unequal which reduces the amplitude of aharonov - bohm oscillations at high magnetic field ( @xmath1 . in three - terminal quantum rings @xcite the magnetic forces besides the reduction of the aharonov - bohm oscillation amplitude lead to a distinct imbalance of the transfer probability to the two output terminals .",
    "an experiment on magnetic forces in three terminal quantum ring performed only recently @xcite confirmed precedent theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the studies of magnetic forces @xcite were based on wave packet dynamics . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we provided a study of magnetic forces in stationary electron flow .",
    "the stationary solution generally reproduces the qualitative features of the wave packet dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "however , at high magnetic field we found @xcite an abrupt reversal of the current circulation and a resulting switch in the transfer probabilities to the two output leads .",
    "it was found @xcite that the interference conditions leading to the reversed current circulation appear for very narrow @xmath2 intervals .",
    "the physical origin of the anomalous current circulation was not explained . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the reversed current circulation is due to fano interference involving ring - localized states with magnetic dipole moment that is antiparallel to the external magnetic field .",
    "the initial and finite states in the electron scattering problem correspond to delocalized states of the energy continuum .",
    "the resonant scattering is qualitatively understood @xcite as due to presence of a metastable state localized at the scattering object that after a finite lifetime @xmath3 decays elastically into the delocalized state .",
    "the non - stationary character of the delocalized state results in a finite width @xmath4 of the scattering resonance as a function of the energy . the width and lifetime are related by the uncertainty relation @xmath5 . in the present problem",
    "the initial and finite states of the scattering process are the channel states of the lowest subband , the energy continuum starts above the transport threshold for the lowest subband , and the metastable states are localized within the ring .    the fano interference @xcite between the channel state carrying the current and the energy - degenerate localized state of a quantum ring or dot typically produces pronounced signatures in the electron transfer probability . the fano resonances are extensively studied for quantum rings and open quantum dots side coupled to the channel @xcite as well as for potential cavities embedded within the channel @xcite . in order to determine the localized resonances we employ the stabilization method @xcite in the version proposed by mandelshtam and coworkers @xcite .",

    "one determines the energy spectrum of a finite system in function of its size .",
    "the spectrum contains energy levels that depend on the system size as well as size - independent energy levels .",
    "the size - dependent energy levels mimic the channel eigenstates and the size - independent energy levels correspond to wave functions that are localized at the scattering object .",
    "the latter are identified with the metastable states giving rise to the fano interference @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present  a first to our knowledge  study of the interplay of fano resonances and magnetic forces in two- and three - terminal quantum rings at high magnetic field . for positive magnetic field",
