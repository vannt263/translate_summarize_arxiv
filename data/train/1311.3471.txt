    "long - range interacting systems are characterized by an interparticle potential with a range that is of the order of the system size . in @xmath1 dimensions",
    ", this corresponds to potentials decaying at large separation , @xmath2 , as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 lies in the range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "examples include gravitational systems @xcite , plasmas @xcite , two - dimensional hydrodynamics @xcite , charged and dipolar systems @xcite , and many others .    despite obvious differences , these systems often share a common phenomenology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the relaxation to equilibrium of an isolated long - range interacting system of @xmath0 particles proceeds in two steps : first , a collisionless relaxation , described by a vlasov - type equation , brings the system close to a nonequilibrium state , called the `` quasistationary state '' ( qss ) , whose lifetime increases with @xmath0 ; second , on timescales diverging with @xmath0 , discreteness effects due to finite value of @xmath0 drive the system towards boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "this second step is usually described by a lenard - balescu - type equation @xcite .",
    "this scenario is well established for plasmas and self - gravitating systems@xcite , and has been studied in detail in various toy models for long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the qss lifetime , which may be regarded to be of the same order of magnitude as the relaxation time , is thus an important quantity : knowing it allows to distinguish between non - relaxed systems , which should be described by a qss , and relaxed ones , for which collisional effects need to be taken into account and an equilibrium description may be relevant .",
    "this lifetime depends on the system under consideration .",
    "kinetic theory usually predicts a qss lifetime of order @xmath0 , e.g. , for 3d plasmas or 1d self - gravitating systems ( see @xcite for recent numerical tests ) , but this is not always the case ; for example , the qss lifetime is of order @xmath6 for 3d self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the lenard - balescu collision term vanishes for 1d systems which do not develop any spatial inhomogeneity ( see @xcite for the 1d coulomb case ) ; one thus expects a relaxation time much longer than @xmath0 in these cases . this is indeed numerically observed , see @xcite , where a time of order @xmath7 is reported , and @xcite , where larger systems sizes are studied and the relaxation time is claimed to be of order @xmath8 .",
    "a similar vanishing of the lenard - balescu operator has been found for point vortices in an axisymmetric configuration @xcite .    in a recent work , qsss",
    "have been looked for and found in a dynamical setting different from the ones reviewed above , namely , in an anisotropic heisenberg model with mean - field interactions @xcite .",
    "note that similar spin models with mean field interactions have been suggested to be relevant to describe some layered spin structures @xcite .",
    "specifically , the model in @xcite comprises @xmath0 globally coupled three - component heisenberg spins evolving under classical spin dynamics .",
    "an associated vlasov - type equation is introduced , and qsss are stationary solutions of this equation .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations for axisymmetric qss suggest a qss lifetime increasing superlinearly with @xmath0 . in order to understand this observation analytically , we present in this work a detailed study of the lenard - balescu operator that accounts for leading finite-@xmath0 corrections of order @xmath9 to the vlasov equation . with respect to 1d hamiltonian systems ,",
    "the spin dynamics introduces a new term in the lenard - balescu operator ; it also complicates the analytical structure of the dispersion relation for the vlasov - type equation .",
    "nevertheless , we can still demonstrate that corrections at order @xmath9 are identically zero , so that relaxation occurs over a time longer than of order @xmath0 , in agreement with the reported numerical results .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe the model of study and its equilibrium phase diagram . as a step towards deriving the vlasov equation to analyze the evolution of the phase space distribution in the limit @xmath10 , in section [ klimontovich ] , we first write down the so - called klimontovich equation ; this leads to a derivation of the vlasov equation and a discussion of a class of its stationary solutions in section [ vlasov ] .",
    "section [ lenard - balescu ] contains our main results : it is devoted to the derivation of the lenard - balescu equation for our model of study , that is , the leading @xmath9 correction to the vlasov equation ; we show that this correction identically vanishes . in section [ examples ] , we consider an example of a vlasov - stationary solution . in the energy range in which it is vlasov stable , we demonstrate by performing numerical simulations of the dynamics that indeed its relaxation to equilibrium occurs over a timescale that does not grow linearly but rather superlinearly with @xmath0 , in support of our analysis .",

    "conclusions in this paper , we have shown that the lenard - balescu operator identically vanishes for a system of globally coupled anisotropic heisenberg spins , in an axially symmetric vlasov - stable state .",
    "this result explains the numerical findings of @xcite , reporting a relaxation time for this system that scales superlinearly with @xmath0 . to our knowledge",
    ", it is the first time that this kind of results has been obtained for a spin dynamics .",
    "this raises further questions , e.g. , what are the general conditions to ensure that the lenard - balescu operator vanishes ?",
    "the classical explanation relies on the structure of resonances between the particle trajectories : in the absence of resonances between particles with different momentum , the lenard - balescu operator should vanish .",
    "this heuristic argument applies to systems of particles moving in a 1d position space , thus with a 2d phase space , when the system is homogeneous @xcite , implying a relaxation time growing superlinearly with @xmath0 .",
    "this is also the case for axisymmetric configurations of point vortices  @xcite , where the phase space is again two - dimensional . in a similar manner , it can be argued for the model we have studied that spins with different projections on the @xmath50-axis can not exchange energy because they can not be in resonance . in a sense , our precise computations validate this qualitative picture .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of a model with a 4d phase space have also shown a relaxation time that appears superlinear in @xmath0 over the range of system sizes studied  @xcite : one would expect resonances to appear in this case .",
    "thus , understanding the general conditions under which the lenard - balescu operator vanishes may still remain a partly open question .",
    "one may also wonder how the relaxation occurs when the lenard - balescu operator vanishes .",
    "formally , the klimontovich expansion suggests that the next leading term is of order @xmath170 .",
    "although writing down this term is possible in principle , its evaluation is difficult .",
    "however , it is not quite clear that the expansion is valid over such long timescales .    finally , let us stress that the standard route to a formal derivation of the lenard - balescu equation , as followed in this article , involves an averaging over initial conditions .",
    "just as what happens for the vlasov equation , one may actually expect that the equation approximately describes a _ single _ initial condition . putting",
    "this on firm mathematical grounds is an outstanding question , on which some preliminary progress has been made recently @xcite .",
