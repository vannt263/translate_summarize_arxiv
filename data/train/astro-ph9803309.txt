    "do black holes interact with an accretion flow in such a way that a unique observational signature can be identified  that is one which is entirely distinct from those associated with other compact objects , based solely on the radiation observed at infinity ?",
    "this is a crucial question confronting both theoretical and observational astrophysicists today ; for recent reviews of the astrophysics of black holes [ see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "certainly a large body of evidence has been accumulated which supports the _ existence _ of black holes , the most convincing arguments being those invoking dynamical mass determinations [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "other arguments have recently been advanced suggesting that x - ray nova flux histories demonstrate the existence of black - hole horizons [ @xcite ] , and in agn , asymmetrical line features have identified and interpreted as originating in massive black hole environments [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "also , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been attributed to dynamical time scales associated with the innermost stable orbits in black hole binaries [ @xcite ] .",
    "a distinct feature of black hole spacetime geometries , as opposed to those associated with other compact objects , is the presence of the event horizon . near the horizon",
    "the strong gravitational field is expected to dominate the pressure forces and thus drive the accreting material into free fall .",
    "in contrast , for other compact objects the pressure forces are dominant near the surface and the free fall state is absent .",
    "recently , titarchuk and zannias ( 1998 ) ( hereafter tz98 ) have developed the relativistic radiative transfer theory demonstrating that high - energy photons are produced by upscattering from the converging inflow within a few schwarzschild radii .",
    "only some fraction of the radiation emitted by the accretion disk illuminates the converging inflow site .",
    "it can be such a situation that the radiation density ( or pressure ) determined by the injected energy of those soft disk photons and by the weak amplification they experience [ @xcite ; hereafter tmk97 ] is much smaller than the eddington value .",
    "_ we argue that then this difference is crucial and it results in a unique observational signature for accreting black holes_.    as explained above , this signature originates from upscattering of low energy photons by fast moving electrons with velocities , @xmath2 , approaching the speed of light , @xmath3 . a soft photon of energy @xmath4 , in the process of multiple scattering off the electrons ,",
    "gets substantially blue - shifted to energy @xmath5 due to doppler effect provided at least one photon is scattered in the direction of electron motion ( i.e. when @xmath6 ) .",
    "for example , in the first scattering event we assume the direction of incident photon , @xmath7 , is nearly normal to the electron velocity , and the direction of the scattered photon is nearly aligned with the electron velocity . in the process the its outward propagation through the converging - inflow medium , the angle between the photon and electron velocity increases .",
    "thus , in the second event the cosine angle , @xmath8 , tends to approach zero .",
    "the angle of outgoing photon , @xmath9 , has to be large enough , in order for the doppler boosted photon to reach an observer .",
    "any system having a disk structure around a compact object is expected to have a source of low - energy photons . _",
    "the boosted photon component is seen as the extended power - law at energies much higher than the characteristic energy of the soft photons . and",
    "it is entirely independent of the initial spectral and spatial distributions of the low - energy photons . _",
    "the spectral index of the boosted photon distribution is determined only by the mass accretion rate and the plasma temperature of the bulk flow . _",
    "the presence of this high - energy power - law component is a generic feature of the model .",
    "_ a key ingredient in support of our claim comes from the exact relativistic transfer calculations describing the compton scattering of the low - energy radiation field of the maxwellian distribution of fast moving electrons ( tz98 ) .",
    "it was proven mathematically that the power law is always present as a part of the black hole spectrum over a wide energy range , extending up to 500 kev .",
    "a turnover in the spectrum at about this energy , i.e. at e@xmath10 , is a prediction of our model .",
    "other extended power - law components , which may be related to the relativistic electron motion , e.g. in a jet , are not uniquely constrained to this energy band because they are not tied with the electron rest mass @xmath11 .",
    "the observations with cgro / osse could in principle confirm or refute this prediction . in practice ,",
    "the data thus far obtained are signal - to - noise limited and can not address this issue in a definitive manner .    in this letter",
    "we extract the most important points regarding the radiative transfer and present observational evidence which supports the model .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere ( tmk97 , tz98 , @xcite ; hereafter ct95 ) that two effects , the bulk motion upscattering and the compton ( recoil ) downscattering ( herein bmc ) , compete forming the hard tail of the spectrum as an extended power law . the soft part of the spectrum comes from the disk photons seen directly and a subset of those photons which escape from the bmc atmosphere after undergoing a few scatterings but without any significant energy change .",
    "it has also been shown that without taking into account special and general relativistic effects , one is able to reproduce the main features of the full relativistic formalism : the overall spectral energy distribution and the dependence of the high - energy power on mass - accretion rate ( tmk97 ; tz98 ) ; also , refer to recent calculations by laurent & titarchuk ( 1998 ) ( hereafter lt98 ) . in the relativistic treatment",
    ", the compton downscattering becomes less efficient at high energies , due to klein - nishina effects . also , there is a possibility that the electron distribution in the converging inflow can deviate from a maxwellian , flattening at high velocities , since there is insufficient time for it to thermalize .",
    "the hard photon power - law thus extends to higher energies . at the same time however , the spectrum is steepened as a result of gravitational redshift effects .",
    "we have assumed that there is an external illumination of the converging flow by the low - energy black body radiation of an accretion disk having a characteristic temperature @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore we have assumed that this illuminating radiation impinges on the bmc atmosphere with a certain geometry , which we have paramaterized in terms of a  fraction \" @xmath13 .",
    "this fraction is really the first expansion coefficient of the spatial source photon distribution over the set of the eigenfunctions of the bmc formulation ( tmk97 , eq .",
    "30 ) . as we mentioned above (  1 )",
    "the spectral index is independent of the illumination fraction , @xmath14 .",
    "it is clearly demonstrated in tmk97 ( figs 4 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that all reasonable theoretical spectra must exhibit a smooth transition from blackbody - like spectrum to a pure power - law , typically , at energies in the 512 kev range for stellar black holes .    in the soft state when the accretion rate is higher , the soft photons from the the keplerian disk cool the hot region ( compton cloud ) due to thermal comptonization and free - free emission ( ct95 ) .",
    "the cooler converging inflow , as it rushes towards the black hole , scatter the soft - photons within the a radius , @xmath15  some of the photons then undergo outward radiative diffusion . here",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 is scwarzschild radius , @xmath18 is the net accretion rate ( including accretion from the disk plus any halo or other non - keplerian component ) , @xmath19 is the eddington accretion rate , @xmath20 is the mass of the central object , @xmath21 is the proton mass and @xmath22 is the gravitational constant .",
    "it transfers its momentum to the soft - photons to produce the power - law component extending to energies comparable to the kinetic energy of electrons in the converging inflow , i.e. of order @xmath23 . on the other hand _ in the hard state , the hot emission cloud covering the bmc zone prevents us from seeing the photons that are upscattered to subrelativistic energies within a few scwarzschild radii_.    the luminosity of the upscatterd component , the hard power law , has to be very small compared to the eddington luminosity in order for the bmc model to be valid .",
    "the relative normalization of the soft component to the hard power - law is less important provided the inferred luminosity of the hard power - law remains consistent with the assumption of negligible radiation pressure near the black - hole horizon .",
    "the bmc spectral model can be described as the sum of a thermal ( disk ) component and the convolution of some fraction of this component @xmath24 with the upscattering green s function @xmath25 ( tmk97 , eq .",
    "the green s function has the form of a broken power - law with spectral indices @xmath26 and @xmath27 for high @xmath28 and low @xmath29 energy parts respectively , @xmath30    the above convolution is insensitive to the value of the green s function spectral index @xmath27 , which is always much greater than one .",
    "tz98 presented rigorous proof that the hard power - law tail is a signature of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "furthermore , the same statement is valid for the case of a rotating ( kerr ) black hole , although a higher mass accretion rate is required to provide the same efficiency for the soft photon upscattering .",
    "we note that the processes of absorption and emission ( as free - free or synchrotron radiation ) can be neglected provided the plasma temperature of the bulk flow is of order 1 kev or greater for characteristic number densities of order @xmath31 @xmath32 and for magnetic field strengths in the proximity of the black hole of order @xmath33 gauss or less ( ct95 ) .",
    "as a test of the model we have collected data resulting from high - energy observations covering recent activity periods in two galactic x  ray novae : gro j165540 [ @xcite ] and grs 1915 + 105 [ @xcite ] .",
    "x  ray novae comprise perhaps the best test case of the methodology described here , since they are in low - mass binary systems  avoiding the added complications which may arise from the ob star winds in high - mass binary bhcs such as cygnus x1  and because they become exceptionally bright in outburst exhibiting frequent and pronounced high - energy spectral state transitions [ e.g. @xcite , @xcite @xcite ] . furthermore , as a group they comprise the most convincing galactic black  hole candidates .",
    "we constructed composite high - energy spectra for gro j165540 during an outburst in the spring of 1996 ( @xcite ) , covering the  2 - 200 kev spectral region and fit these data by the bmc model .",
    "this was accomplished using summed , standard mode ( 128 channel ) data from the rxte / pca and the 16-channel batse / lad earth - occultation data bracketting the pointed observations . in addition",
    ", there was substantial outburst activity in grs 1915 + 105 during the latter part of 1996 [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "we utilized some of the available data from the same instruments for this event as well .",
    "the bmc model described in section 2 was imported into the  xspec \" software package which was used to perform all of the model fitting described here .",
    "our resulting fits are shown in figure 1 .    for gro j1655 - 40",
    "we obtained a blackbody color temperature of @xmath34  kev for the soft photon source , a energy spectral index of @xmath35 , and a geometric factor @xmath14 , parameterizing the fraction of the total soft photon flux illuminating the bmc inflow atmosphere , of @xmath36 .",
    "the observed 2 - 100  kev flux was @xmath37 ergs/@xmath38/s .",
    "we note that the corresponding luminosity in the hard power - law component is about @xmath39 of @xmath40 ( with an assumption of the distance to the source , @xmath41 kpc and the mass of the central object , 7 solar masses ) , which is consistent with our assumption of negligible radiation pressure near the event horizon .",
    "similar results ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , were obtained for grs 1915 + 105 .    from",
    "the inferred 2 - 200  kev luminosity for gro  j1655 - 40 , @xmath45 of @xmath40 , we derive a mass accretion rate ( in eddington units ) of order 1 , bearing in mind the efficiency of gravitational to radiative energy conversion is of order 5% or less , e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ( hereafter ss73 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath46 is consistent with expected values within the bmc framework .",
    "this suggests that the line - of - sight column density of the bmc atmosphere is of order @xmath47 @xmath48 ( see , tmk97 , eq .",
    "2 ) . however , because the best - fitted color temperature is about 1 kev , ( and this is a lower bound on the bmc plasma temperature ) we conclude that the detected x - ray spectrum is not significantly modified by absorption ( see also  2 ) .",
    "the temperatures we infer for these two sources are somewhat lower than values previously reported [ e.g. zhang et al .",
    "( 1997b ) ] , however this is to be expected .",
    "as noted , our procedure represents a fully self - consistent model deconvolution , whereas most previous approaches are phenomenological , i.e. power law plus black body or multicolor disk .",
    "mathematically , one expects the power law component contribute significant soft - energy flux with the net effect of skewing the thermal residual to higher apparent temperatures .",
    "this will not occur with approach , as the hard power law turns over towards low energies ( see fig 3 , tmk97 ) .",
    "the inferred spectral indices also agree extremely well with our model predictions . in tz98 ,",
    "calculations of the @xmath49 relationship were presented . for the low temperature limit ,",
    "an asymptotic lower limit of @xmath50 was calculated ; for the higher bmc plasma temperatures ( of order 10 kev ) this limit is significantly lower , @xmath51 , and for mass accretion rates of @xmath52 ( see below ) , @xmath26 is precisely in the @xmath53 range we find ( lt98 , titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "thus , we feel our observational test provides extremely encouraging support of our methodology .    using our inferred color temperature @xmath54 and spectral index @xmath26 , along with the measured flux normalization , we can estimate the mass accretion rate , black hole mass and source distance within the framework of standard accretion disk theory ( e.g. ss73 ) .",
    "this additionally requires certain assumptions regarding a  hardening factor \"  the ratio of color temperature to the effective plasma temperature ( @xcite , hereafter sht95 ) .",
    "in fact , the spectral index ( tmk97 , tz98 , lt98 ) depends on the mass accretion rate and the plasma temperature ; the disk color temperature is @xmath55 ( ss73 ) , and the normalization is @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the distance to the source ) .",
    "an ideal test case is gro  j1655 - 40 , since its mass and distance are known to a high degree of accuracy ( relative to other bhcs ) .",
    "the distance we infer , @xmath58 kpc , is consistent ( at the @xmath59 level ) with previous determinations ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the black hole mass we calculate can be reconciled with determinations from dynamical studies ( @xcite ) provided we used the hardening factor 1.9 ( sht95 ) .",
    "this assumed a mass accretion rate @xmath60 , which was the value obtained from monte carlo simulations performed to calculate the spectral index dependence on the mass accretion rate and plasma temperature ( lt98 ) .",
    "again , this is an encouraging result suggesting that with further refinement , one has a method of mass and distance determination independent of the conventional quiescent spectroscopic and photometric studies , which are not always plausible .",
    "the successful application of our basic model to observational data and the inferred physical parameters of those systems in comparison to independent determinations is encouraging .",
    "we postulate that ( i)_the soft state detected in gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 represents a generic feature of accreting galactic black holes .",
    "an extragalactic analog may now be evident in the narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy population . _",
    "( ii ) _ the bmc spectra represent a characteristic signature of black hole horizons . the disk flux , of order 5% @xmath61 tends to cool the ambient environment and the generic hard power - law components",
    "is seen by the observer . _",
    "( iii ) _ because this spectral feature is formed very close to the horizon , ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the variability timescales of high - energy line and continuum radiation should be associated with the crossing time scale @xmath63 _ s. ( iv ) _ the variability seen in the soft component is not expected to be correlated with the hard component .",
    "it is related to the illumination geometry of a small area of the black hole horizon site , whereas the soft radiation seen by the observer directly emanates from a major fraction of the entire disk which comprises a much larger area . _",
    "( v ) _ qpos emanating from the inner edge of the accretion disk should lead to a pronounced hard- x - ray variability signature , because the seed photons for the converging flow upscattering come from the same inner disk region . _",
    "( vi ) _ the appearance of an additional bump in the energy range 10 - 20 kev can be explained in terms of downscattering ( reflection ) effects ( st80 ) from the inner edge of the accretion disk . _",
    "our conclusions are consistent with various observations of galactic and extragalactic black hole systems .",
    "for example , in nls1s the x - ray power - law is significantly steeper and its normalization is more variable , with time scale of order @xmath64 s , than in broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this suggests the nls1s may represent the extragalactic analog of the high - soft state ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "several groups have independently reached similar conclusions ( ct95 , @xcite ) .",
    "we further note that the equivalent widths of fe features detected tend to be large , in some cases @xmath65 ev ( @xcite , hereafter c98 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the detection of the strong hydrogen - like iron line is expected if the source of hard energy photons ( @xmath66 kev ) is located inside the the converging inflow region(and alternatively , line radiation could form in the cooler , compton cloud ambient to the converging inflow region ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the ionization parameter @xmath67 ergs  cm  @xmath68 is a typical value for the converging inflow and it is almost independent of the central object mass . in this case , only the hydrogen - like iron would be expected ( kallman and mccray 1982 ) , which has been confirmed recently by bepposax observations ( c98 ) .",
    "recent rxte observations of cyg x-1 during a state transition [ @xcite ] revealed a striking decrease in the soft - to - hard photon lag times as the source passes from the hard to soft state .",
    "this is very strong empirical evidence that the soft seed photons , which comprise a of fraction the disk thermal component , and the hard - x - ray power law emanate from a common compact region , again consistent with our model .",
    "the detection of 67 hz qpos from grs  1915 + 105 by rxte was recently reported by @xcite .",
    "it was clearly demonstrated that this feature is associated with the high energy component visible in the pca .",
    "this can be explained in terms of a qpo in the inner edge of the disk or by @xmath69mode disk oscillations occurring within the characteristic radius of 4 @xmath17 [ @xcite ] .",
    "this should lead to variations in the hard spectral component since significant changes in the illumination geometry of the converging inflow site , can occur ( tmk97 , tz98 ) .",
    "similar intrepretation can be applied to the 300 hz qpos detected by rxte in groj165540 [ @xcite ] .    in conclusion",
    ", we wish to emphasize once again that the observations presented here , along with some observational trends presented by others in the literature , and the relativistic theory prompt us to claim that _ we have identified a generic spectral signature black hole accretion .",
