    "the cooling of atoms in traps is an important tool in the study of ultracold bose or fermi gases .",
    "usually , the last step in the cooling process is evaporative cooling .",
    "this technique , however , can only be used for sufficiently strongly interacting gases since thermodynamic equilibrium of the cooled gas must be ( nearly ) attained during the entire cooling process .",
    "there is a number of gases in which the interaction is too weak for evaporative cooling to work .",
    "moreover , because of the exclusion principle the method fails at low temperature for identical fermions with parallel spins  @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "one resorts to `` sympathetic cooling '' : another gas is cooled evaporatively and acts as the cooling agent for the gas to be cooled .",
    "the method of sympathetic cooling was proposed almost twenty years ago@xcite and has since found widespread application ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . exciting",
    "recent applications include the sympathetic cooling of atoms of different species : @xmath0k and @xmath1rb @xcite , @xmath2li and @xmath3cs @xcite , of different isotopes of the same species : the bosonic species @xmath4rb cooled by @xmath1rb @xcite and @xmath5li fermions in a bath of @xmath2li bosons @xcite , and the production of dual bose  einstein condensates ( bec ) with sympathetic cooling@xcite .",
    "only a few theoretical descriptions of sympathetic cooling exist .",
    "the simplest descriptions are purely classical while more sophisticated employ the quantum boltzmann equation or master equations .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and mosk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived a classical formula for the time dependence of the temperature and a classical formula for the cooling rate .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have formulated sympathetic cooling of fermi gases in terms of a quantum boltzmann equation .",
    "the tremendous simplification of the collision matrix elements achieved in this way precludes , however , a quantitative description of the cooling process .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived a master equation for sympathetic cooling .",
    "unfortunately , that master equation is too complex to be practically useful .",
    "recently , the present authors simplified this master equation by means of decoherence and ergodicity arguments  @xcite and obtained two different sets of rate equations that both describe sympathetic cooling of bose or fermi gases .",
    "these rate equations are simple enough to permit practical calculations while they contain detailed information about the quantum scattering processes between the cooled gas and the bath .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we want to compare the solutions of our rate equations with the much simpler expression for the classical cooling rate obtained by delannoy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and mosk _ al .",
    "second , we use the rate equations to study the growth of a bose ",
    "einstein condensate for a system of @xmath6na cooled by @xmath1rb , and for @xmath2li in a bath of @xmath7cs .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ rates ]",
    "we present the rate equations that we use .",
    "the results , i.e. the comparison between quantum and classical cooling rates and the study of the growth of the condensate , are presented in sect .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "finally we give our summary .",
    "in this section we present two different sets of rate equations that are derived in ref .",
    ". both sets of rate equations have been derived from a master equation  @xcite for sympathetic cooling by means of decoherence and ergodicity arguments .",
    "it is assumed that the cooling agent has a considerably larger mass than the gas to be cooled .",
    "the latter consists of @xmath8 ( very weakly interacting ) bosons in a spherically harmonic trap of frequency @xmath9 .",
    "single - particle trap orbitals have energies @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the set of cartesian quantum numbers , and the single - particle ground state energy is set to zero .",
    "the first set of rate equations describes how the mean occupation number @xmath12 of orbital @xmath13 changes due to interactions with the cooling agent : @xmath14 the form of these equations is intuitively obvious .",
    "note that the rate equations  ( [ fact ] ) are of mean - field type and neglect correlations between occupancies of different single - particle orbitals .",
    "particle number conservation implies that this approximation may fail when the occupancy of the ground state @xmath15 approaches the total number of particles in the gas to be cooled .",
    "particular solutions to these mean - field type rate equations are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rate coefficients @xmath16 are input to the rate equations  ( [ fact ] ) . for the computation of the rate coefficients",
    "@xmath17 we assume that the bath particles are boltzmann - distributed .",
    "a practical recipe for their computation is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we express the @xmath17 s in units of [ omega ] = ( 32 ^ 4)^-1 _ b^3 n_b ( a/ l_0)^2 [ ( m+m)^2 /(m m ) ] . here",
    "@xmath18 is the density of bath particles , @xmath19 their thermal de ",
    "broglie wave length , @xmath20 the inverse temperature , @xmath21 the oscillator length , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass of the cooling agent and the gas to be cooled , respectively .",
    "the interaction between bath and system is described in terms of the @xmath24-wave scattering length @xmath25 .",
    "the second set of rate equations is based on a microcanonical approach and describes how the probability @xmath26 of having the gas to be cooled at total energy @xmath27 changes with time : [ micro ] + & & ( p_m+ n_n [ n_m + 1 ] _",

    "they are thus microcanonical averages of occupancies .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath33 . in eq .",
    "( [ micro ] ) , the @xmath26 s are the unknowns while the rate coefficients @xmath17 and the quantities @xmath31 \\rangle_m$ ] are input quantities defined in the framework of our model .",
    "the rate coefficients are identical to those used in the mean - field type rate equations  ( [ fact ] ) . to compute the quantities @xmath34 \\rangle_m$ ]",
    "we neglect correlations by putting @xmath35\\rangle_{m } \\approx \\langle n_{\\vec n}\\rangle_m [ \\langle n_{\\vec m}\\rangle_m + 1]$ ] and replace the microcanonical average by the grand canonical average [ nocc ] n_m_m & = & n_m(z , t ) + & = & z(e)1-z(e)|_e = m  .",
    "expressions for the energy - dependent fugacity @xmath36 and temperature @xmath37 can be obtained numerically from the grand canonical partition function of non - interacting bosons in a harmonic trap . for details , we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the the microcanonical rate equations are expected to be valid also in the regime of bec .",
    "we study the cooling process for different temperatures of the bath and for different combinations of bath and system .",
    "the system always consists of @xmath38 bosons and the harmonic trap is cut off beyond the single - particle orbitals with energy @xmath39 , @xmath40 . in the microcanonical approach , the homogeneous system of linear rate equations  ( [ micro ] ) can be put into matrix form . for stability reasons ,",
    "the real parts of the eigenvalues of this matrix must be zero or negative .",
    "the equilibrium solution is determined by the eigenvalue zero .",
    "the equilibration rate is given by the modulus of the real part of the eigenvalue with largest negative real part .",
    "the leading eigenvalues are computed using the sparse matrix solver arpack @xcite . within our numerical accuracy",
    "we found one zero eigenvalue and no eigenvalues with positive real parts .",
    "the results for the equilibration rate @xmath41 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the temperatures are chosen such that @xmath42 is close to the critical temperature while @xmath43 yields a bec at the end of the cooling process ( @xmath44 denotes boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "we turn to the rate equations  ( [ fact ] ) .",
    "we took the bosons of the system @xmath45 to be initially equally distributed over the degenerate single ",
    "particle orbitals with energy @xmath46 , all other orbitals being empty .",
    "this initial configuration has the highest energy that can be realized in the finite trap we are considering . while details of the initial conditions are reflected in the short - time evolution they can not affect the long - time behavior and the equilibration rate",
    ". the rate equations  ( [ fact ] ) need to be modified in the regime of bec ; we therefore restrict the computation to the case @xmath42 .",
    "we solve the rate equations numerically and extract the equilibration rate @xmath47 from the solution at large times .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that the equilibration rates @xmath41 and @xmath48 depend only very weakly on the composition of system and bath for @xmath49 . comparing the rate @xmath41 obtained in the microcanonical approach with the rate @xmath48 from factorization , we note that the former is about a factor @xmath50 larger than the latter .",
    "the time evolution however shows that the loss of energy at short times is practically identical in both approaches .",
    "most of the energy is removed from system @xmath45 during the early part of the cooling process .",
    "therefore , both approaches yield comparable predictions for the cooling time .",

    "it is however meaningful to compare equilibration rates since these do not depend on initial conditions . in order to compare the equilibration rates ,",
    "we have adjusted the formulas of ref.@xcite to the case of a homogeneous bath . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the classical rate @xmath52 ( which decreases quadratically with decreasing temperature ) is seen to be about a factor 2 larger than the quantum  mechanical rate @xmath53 ) below the condensation temperature , and a factor 1.7 to 3 smaller in the regime of bec .",

    "we chose @xmath54 and followed the time evolution of the total energy @xmath55 by solving the rate equations  ( [ micro ] ) numerically .",
    "as initial conditions we took @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . this is the configuration with highest energy that might be realized in the open trap . using the grand canonical partition function , we obtain the time - dependent temperature @xmath37 for the system , and the time - dependent ground state occupation number @xmath59 from eq.([nocc ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the result for two different systems .",
    "note that the bec grows faster in the rb - na system , which also has the larger equilibration rate [ in units of @xmath60 , see eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ] .",
    "the reason for this behavior is not easy to understand : table  [ tab1 ] shows that equilibration rates for both systems are quite similar at temperature @xmath61 while they differ considerably below the critical temperature .",
    "note that a naive ( and classical ) explanation would link the difference in rates to the smaller momentum transfer during li - cs collisions and thereby to the larger mass difference .",
    "our quantum mechanical results show that the situation is more complex .",
    "the onset of bec is rather sudden and non - exponential while the long time evolution is exponential .",
    "qualitatively similar observations have been made in numerical simulations of evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "one does not obtain 100% bec since the final temperature is only about half the condensation temperature and the system is not of macroscopic size .",
    "in summary , we have used two sets of rate equations to describe sympathetic cooling of bose gases by a much heavier gas .",
    "practical calculations in the systems @xmath6na-@xmath1rb and @xmath2li-@xmath7cs show that the cooling times from both rate equations agree well with each other .",
    "our quantum  mechanical equilibration rates are in fair agreement with each other but differ considerably from the classical rates .",
    "this is unfortunate since the classical approach is much simpler than the quantum  mechanical description presented in this work .",
