    "cosmological observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large scale distribution of galaxies indicate that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on scales larger than about 100 megaparsecs @xcite .",
    "the apparent acceleration of the expansion of the universe deduced from type ia supernova observations and the cmb , wmap and planck data @xcite-@xcite , is one of the most striking cosmological observations of recent times . in the context of flrw models with matter and radiation energy components , the acceleration of our universe",
    "can not be explained and would require either the presence of a cosmological constant or a new form of matter which does not clump and dominates the late time evolution with a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "however , since there is no explanation for the presence of a cosmological constant of the appropriate value and there is no natural candidate for dark energy , it is tempting to look for alternative explanations by simply taking one step back and noticing one of the fundamental assumptions of cosmology , homogeneity @xcite .",
    "recently , inhomogeneous models of the universe have become popular among cosmologists @xcite .",
    "one of the inhomogeneous cosmological models which is a solution of einstein equations with perfect fluid source and conformally flat is the stephani model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the matter in these solutions has zero shear and rotation and moves with acceleration @xcite .",
    "this solution was obtained by stephani in 1967 .",
    "his solution emerged as one of the spacetimes that can be embedded in a flat five dimensional space @xcite .",
    "this universe and some of its subcases have been examined in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it has also been used in stellar models @xcite-@xcite and some generalizations to flrw @xcite .",
    "other papers have pointed out their singularities @xcite-@xcite and the thermodynamics of their fluid source @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , models with inhomogeneous pressure for testing the astronomical data related to supernovae observations have been put forward @xcite . in these solutions ,",
    "the energy density of matter , @xmath0 , depends only on cosmic time , @xmath1 , while pressure , @xmath2 , depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath3 which means that the temperature varies with spatial position .",
    "one of the objections to this model is their incompatibility with a linear barotropic equation of the form @xmath4 with a constant @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , this incompatibility would not prohibit one to dismiss this solution since the non - barotropic equation of state can not be ruled out a priori .",
    "the solution has a curvature parameter which is time dependent and does not have any special form .",
    "generally , the curvature parameter can be positive at one time and negative at another time , thus this spacetime is interesting for its topological dynamics among cosmologists .",
    "the evolution of the model depends on some arbitrary functions , accordingly it can be named as private universe @xcite . in the work by stelmach and jakacka @xcite , they assume that the curvature parameter relates to scale factor by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "they showed that with @xmath8 a cosmological model with dust source can lead to the accelerated expansion at later times of evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we use the energy balance equation to obtain the pressure and energy density .",
    "we assume a non - barotropic equation of state to provide a reasonable interpretation for the stephani universe .",
    "we consider an ansatz of the type @xmath9 for studying the model .",
    "we show that the field equation is similar to the cardassian model where the expansion of the universe is accelerated without postulating any exotic matter field @xcite .",
    "we find that for some specific values of @xmath10 the model exhibits accelerated expansion at later stages of evolution which is in agreement with the recent planck data @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section two , the stephani universe is studied as an alternative model of the universe . the pressure as a function of spacetime coordinates",
    "is derived . in section three",
    ", we calculate observable quantities such as the hubble and the deceleration parameters .",
    "we show that in the considered model a negative deceleration parameter can be observed which is in agreement with the recent observations @xcite .",
    "we derive a general statement for the age of the universe in the model .",
    "we show that how positive accelerated expansion of the universe can appear in the model without using any exotic matter . in the last section",
    ", we will draw some conclusions .",
    "by inserting the line element ( [ eq1 ] ) and the energy - momentum tensor ( [ eq3 ] ) into einstein field equations the time - time component of the field equations will be @xmath34 where @xmath35 eq.([eq7 ] ) shows that @xmath0 is a function of @xmath1 only .",
    "we can obtain the form of pressure @xmath36 from ( [ eq6 ] ) as @xmath37,\\ ] ] and from the equation of momentum balance ( [ eq8 ] ) we arrive at @xmath38 ^ 2}=0,\\ ] ] where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the stephani universe has two arbitrary functions of time @xmath39 whose values are not prescribed @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the curvature parameter and the matter energy density have the following power law forms @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 we set @xmath42 where @xmath5 is the equation of state parameter which exists in flrw models , @xmath43 and @xmath10 are constants , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the present values of the scale factor and matter energy density , respectively . a time derivative of the eq.([eq7 ] ) leads to the raychaudhuri equation given by @xmath46 inserting ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) into ( [ eq9 ] ) leads to @xmath47 note that at the symmetry center @xmath48 for a matter - dominated universe @xmath49 pressure vanishes , but at large distances from the symmetry center it will be negative , thus in the presence of a non - relativistic matter , due to a negative pressure at large distances , the expansion can be observed . by comparing eq.([eq14 ] ) with the general equation of state with a non - constant parameter @xmath50",
    "we get @xmath51 which can be regarded as the dynamical equation of state parameter for the stephani universe . for @xmath52 ( switching off the inhomogeneities )",
    ", we have @xmath53 and the model reduces to the flrw universe .",
    "in order to study the cosmological parameters which can be determined via observational data , it is important to derive some of the observational quantities in the stephani universe .",
    "the kinematics of the universe is described by the hubble parameter @xmath54 and the deceleration parameter @xmath55 . for calculating these parameters",
    "we rewrite the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) in the comoving coordinate @xmath56 $ ] which reduces to @xmath57,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath58 now the definitions for @xmath59 and @xmath55 will be @xmath60 note that due to the inhomogeneity that occurs in this universe , the hubble and deceleration parameters will no longer be spatially constant . however , it is possible to choose a time parameter in which the spatial dependence of the hubble and deceleration parameters can vanish @xcite .",
    "consequently , the above definition for the hubble parameter reduces to @xmath61 also the deceleration parameter reads @xmath62 which can be rewritten as @xmath63 where @xmath64    with @xmath65 eq.([eq18a ] ) reduces to the deceleration parameter obtained in the work by stelmach and jakacka @xcite in which they showed that with a negative @xmath43 the deceleration parameter decreases with increasing distance to the observed galaxy .    the resemblance of the eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) with the first dynamical equation of the flrw universe allows us to insert eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) to get an expression between @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 moreover by setting @xmath70 in eq .",

    "( [ eq23 ] ) which yields @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the scale of the universe in units @xmath44 . with @xmath65 eq.([eq26 ] ) corresponds to the age of the universe obtained in the work by stelmach and jakacka @xcite . for the present epoch",
    "we assume that the universe is only composed of dust @xmath49 and for simplicity in our calculations we put @xmath74 as we do in flat flrw models .",
    "accordingly , eqs .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) reduce to @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "the lookback time @xmath78 as a function of the energy density @xmath79 in the model for some specific values of @xmath10 and in the flrw models are presented in fig.[9876 ] .",
    "we realize that the age of the universe in the discussed model for @xmath80 is larger than in flrw models corresponding to the same values of the parameters @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite . as an example according to eq.([eq27",
    "] ) by setting @xmath84 the age of the universe will be @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "lookback time @xmath87 in the spherically symmetric stephani cosmological model for some selected values of @xmath10 and in flrw model as a function of the energy density @xmath79 . ]    at the late stage of the cosmological evolution when the scale factor is large , the first and the second terms in eq.([eq40 ] ) can dominate and we can apply the following approximations . from now on we assume that @xmath88 .",
    "we consider eq.([eq40 ] ) in the late time epoch which can be solved for the scale factor to yield @xmath89 , & \\hspace{.8 cm } n=2,\\\\ \\left[h_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{1-\\omega_{m,0}}\\right]^{\\frac{2}{2-n } } t^{\\frac{2}{2-n } } , & \\hspace{.8 cm }   n>1,\\quad   $ or$ \\quad-1<n<0,\\\\ ( \\frac{3}{2}h_{0}\\sqrt{\\omega_{m,0}})^\\frac{2}{3 } t^{\\frac{2}{3}},&\\hspace{0.8 cm } n<-1 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] we should point out that the case @xmath90 has a exponential form for the scale factor in the late time stage which is the same as the vacuum flrw models with cosmological constant .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the universe in this model is only filled with dust which leads to the above expressions . in the case",
    "@xmath91 we get a sort of dust dominated universe .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq41 ] ) that the deceleration parameter for the late time epoch can be derived for the above stages as @xmath92 for all of the above values of @xmath10 , the deceleration parameter is negative , thus the accelerated expansion of the universe is obtained without using any exotic matter or cosmological constant . in fig.[nn ] the deceleration parameter is plotted for @xmath93 as a function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the deceleration parameter in the spherically symmetric stephani cosmological model as function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath93 ]    it is seen from fig.[nn ] that the acceleration becomes larger as the distance to the observed object is increased .",
    "in other words , in the inhomogeneous universe acceleration of the expansion increases with the distance .    it should be also noted that eqs.([eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq40 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath97 where the constants @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined as @xmath100 the above equation is similar to the model proposed by freese and lewis @xcite which is an alternative model explaining the accelerating universe .",
    "this model is called cardassian model where the flrw equation is modified by the presence of the term @xmath101 .",
    "this seems to be interesting in the way that the expansion of the universe is accelerated automatically by the presence of the second term without suggesting any unknown form of exotic matter @xcite .",
    "in this paper we considered the inhomogeneous stephani universe characterized with a time dependent curvature index .",
    "although we obtained results for general @xmath102 ( equation of state parameter ) , but we focused our attention on the model with only dust as the fluid component of the universe .",
    "we found the age of the universe in the model which was remarkably larger than the corresponding age in the flrw models without exotic matter .",
    "we derived the deceleration parameter which was dependent on the scale factor and radial coordinate , moreover we showed that the acceleration becomes larger while increasing the distance .",
    "the fore - mentioned results were based on the ansatz of the type @xmath103 for the spatial curvature parameter and we showed that in the late time epoch of evolution , by choosing the appropriate values for @xmath10 , the power - law solution can be revived in the considered model .",
