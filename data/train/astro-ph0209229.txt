    "almost four decades after their discovery ( muller , oort , & raimond 1963 ) , the origin of high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ; wakker & van woerden 1997 ) remains a mystery .",
    "defined by their incompatibility with a simple model of differential galactic rotation , hvcs exhibit sub - solar metallicities and are currently favored to reside in the galactic halo . within this picture , it is not clear whether the source of hvcs is predominantly the accretion of low - metallicity gas onto the galaxy ( wakker et al .",
    "1999 ) or whether the material traces condensed outflows of hot enriched gas in a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) .",
    "intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) , in contrast , exhibit solar metallicities and are thought to be of galactic origin ( richter et al .",
    "alternative hypotheses for the hvcs identify the majority of them as extragalactic objects within the local group at galactocentric distances up to 500 kpc ( blitz et al . 1999 ) , or posit that at least the subset known as compact high velocity clouds ( chvcs ) are extragalactic ( braun & burton 1999 ) .",
    "these objects would then be remnants of the formation of the local group .",
    "the statistics of moderate - redshift mg ii and lyman limit absorbers ( charlton , churchill , & rigby 2000 ) , would seem to rule out this hypothesis as a general scenario for group formation . in any event , the simulations which underpin the arguments for an extragalactic origin for the hvcs generally do not require such an identification for the very large complexes of hvcs , such as complex c. however , within their model it is possible that complex c might represent one of these building blocks viewed at a very close distance .",
    "complex c occupies nearly the same angular extent ( @xmath1 deg@xmath2 ) as the magellanic stream and consists of a number of separate hvc cores in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "the magellanic stream has been linked to the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) through modeling of a tidal interaction with the milky way ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) and through the similarity in metallicity of the stream ( 0.2 - 0.3 solar ; lu et al . 1998 ; gibson et al . 2000 ; sembach et al . 2001 ) and smc .",
    "in contrast , complex c shows no obvious connection to the galaxy .",
    "the distance to complex c is at least 1.5 kpc ( de boer et al . 1994 ) from the non - detection of absorption lines toward high - latitude stars , although wakker ( 2001 ) has recently put a new , albeit weak , lower limit at 6 kpc .",
    "the lack of a strong distance constraint or evidence for interaction with the galaxy make absorption - line studies of abundances in quasar sightlines the best option for gaining insight into the origin of complex c. the first such study for complex c , from _ hst _ goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) data along the markarian 290 sightline by wakker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , inferred a metallicity of 0.1 solar based on the h@xmath0-corrected [ / ] abundance .",
    "those authors interpreted this abundance as evidence for infalling low - metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) posited to explain the `` g - dwarf problem . '' recently , however , other studies have demonstrated that the metallicity of complex c varies from sightline to sightline .",
    "gibson et al . ( 2001 ; hereafter g01 ) looked at all available archival ghrs and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) data for five complex c sightlines ( including mrk 290 ) and found that the metallicity inferred from the abundance varies between 0.1 - 0.4 solar , implying that complex c may be contaminated by enriched gas from the galactic disk .",
    "other recent studies complicate the picture and further illustrate the point that complex c may not be well described by a single metallicity .",
    "richter et al . ( 2001a ) combine _ fuse _ and stis data for the pg 1259 + 593 sightline and find an  abundance of 0.1 solar , while murphy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find an abundance of   near 0.5 solar from _ fuse _ observations of the mrk 876 sightline .",
    "the increasing availability of high - quality , far - ultraviolet _ fuse _ and _ hst_/stis spectra has allowed the study of multiple transitions of the dominant ionization stages of n , o , si , fe , ar , p , and s. in addition to estimates of the absolute abundances of these elements , the relative abundances of these elements can be inferred , sometimes more precisely than their absolute abundances .",
    "this allows a preliminary study of the depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains and the nucleosynthetic history of the gas .    using _",
    "spectra , savage & sembach ( 1996 ) find that gas - phase abundances of refractory elements in the galactic halo can be significantly depleted . for five halo sightlines ,",
    "those authors find that the mean depletion from solar abundance is @xmath3 0.3 dex for si and @xmath3 0.6 dex for fe , while the s abundance is essentially solar .",
    "however , it is difficult to completely separate the effects of depletion from ionization effects .",
    "although each element has a dominant ionization stage , no element is completely in one stage , and the fraction remaining in other stages varies with the element . as we show below , with enough measurements of different elements , it is possible to separate these two effects and assess the degree of depletion along sightlines toward complex c.    recent reviews have discussed the long history of exploiting relative abundances to reveal information about the chemical evolution of the gas ( e.g. , pettini 2002 ; matteucci 2002 ) .",
    "alpha - process elements ( such as o , ne , si , and s ) are produced predominantly by type ii supernovae ( sne ) , while fe is produced primarily by type ia sne .",
    "nitrogen , however , is primarily produced by lower mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage . with the bulk of @xmath0-element production occurring relatively soon after star - formation is initiated , the release of n and fe into the ism can thus lag s or o enrichment by @xmath4 myr ( henry et al .",
    "if the gas is somehow stripped from star - forming regions , either by a tidal interaction or in an outflow induced by combined sn - activity , then the resulting metal - content will be significantly n - poor .",
    "g01 and wakker ( 2001 ) each interpret the low relative abundance of n in complex c as evidence for primary enrichment by type ii sne .",
    "the cited complex c abundance studies have all used different methods to infer metallicities of complex c. some studies fit the complex c metal - line profiles with a gaussian to determine the equivalent width , @xmath5 , while others simply integrate the profile over the complex c velocity range established by the  profile .",
    "these studies have also used different methods to determine species column densities , such as curve - of - growth ( cog ) fitting , an apparent optical depth ( aod ) calculation ( savage & sembach 1991 ) , or an assumption that these profiles are optically thin .",
    "in addition , except for the richter et al .",
    "( 2001a ) work , these studies have typically concentrated on either _ fuse _ or _ hst _ data alone .",
    "the _ fuse _ data have the advantage that the covered spectral range includes numerous lines of , whose abundance is not as strongly influenced as  by ionization effects ( charge exchange keeps  closely coupled to ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to study all archival _ fuse _ and _ hst _ data for sightlines through complex c. using a consistent method of analysis , we then determine abundances for the various metal species to infer information regarding the origin of hvc complex c. the positions of the eight sightlines are shown in figure 1 , overlayed on  emission data for complex c from the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ and _ hst _ observations are discussed in   2 .",
    "results for the analysis for the eight sightlines are presented in   3 .",
    "the results are discussed in   4 .",
    "the _ fuse _ observations for these eight sightlines were obtained from the publicly available multimission archive ( mast ) at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the total exposure times for _ fuse _ observations towards the sightlines range from 8.3 ks for pg 1626 + 554 to 610.6 ks for pg 1259 + 593 and , as a result , data quality within the sample varies significantly .",
    "all sightlines were observed through the @xmath6 lwrs aperture in time - tag mode .",
    "a summary of the _ fuse _ observations is shown in table 1 . for a complete description of the _ fuse _ instrument and its operation see moos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the raw data were obtained from the archive and calibrated spectra were extracted using a pass through the calfuse ( v. 2.0.5 ) reduction pipeline .",
    "this version of the pipeline makes the correct transformation to a heliocentric wavelength scale . in versions",
    "earlier than 2.0 , a sign error in file - header keywords resulted in the wrong heliocentric wavelength correction . in order to improve",
    "signal - to - noise for these data we include both `` day '' and `` night '' photons in the final calibrated spectra .",
    "the inclusion of `` day '' photons leads to strong airglow contamination of interstellar  and  absorption lines .",
    "however , the contamination is generally centered at @xmath7 km s@xmath8 and does not affect the higher - velocity complex c absorption as confirmed by comparisons of unscreened spectra to spectra where `` day '' photons were screened by calfuse .",
    "individual exposures were then coadded , weighted by their exposure times , to yield a final spectrum .    a single resolution element of the _ fuse _ spectrum is about 20 km s@xmath8 ( @xmath9 pixels ) and , as a result data are oversampled at that resolution .",
    "thus , to further improve signal - to - noise , data were rebinned over 3 , 5 , or 7 pixels depending on the initial data quality . a common problem with analysis of _ fuse _",
    "spectra is the setting of an absolute wavelength scale .",
    "the most common technique is to shift the wavelength scale by determining the velocity offset of line centroids from known absorption features .",
    "this was carried out by comparing the centroid of galactic  emission to various galactic absorption features such as those of  ( @xmath101048.22 , 1066.66 ) , ( @xmath101125.45 , 1144.94 ) , and h@xmath11 .",
    "we estimate the absolute wavelength scale to be accurate to within @xmath9 km s@xmath8 .",
    "all available calibrated _ hst _ data for these sightlines were also obtained from mast .",
    "the data consist of stis and ghrs observations for seven of the sightlines .",
    "no _ hst _ spectroscopic data exist for pg 1626 + 554 .",
    "see table 2 for a summary of the _ hst _ observations .",
    "final spectra were obtained by coadding individual exposures , weighted by their exposure times .    in order to both improve signal - to - noise and to match pixel size in velocity to that of the rebinned",
    "_ fuse _ data , the _ hst _ data were rebinned to 3 or 5 pixels . in a few cases , data were not rebinned as the pixel sizes were already comparable to the rebinned _ fuse _ data .",
    "finally , the absolute wavelength scale was set as for the _ fuse _ data , comparing the   ( @xmath101199.550 ) and  ( @xmath101250.584 , 1253.811 , 1259.519 ) lines to the centroid of galactic  emission .",
    "we detect metal - line absorption associated with complex c in each of these sightlines .",
    "individual line profiles were normalized by fitting low - order polynomials to the continuum in the region immediately surrounding the line in question .",
    "regions within @xmath12   about the galactic line - centroid were used for the continuum normalization , although in a number of cases spurious absorption near the line required the use of a much larger region for continuum measurement . for each sightline , the velocity range of complex c is determined from the  profile from the lds data .",
    "the equivalent width , @xmath5 , of an absorption feature could then be measured by integrating the line over the velocity range occupied by complex c. in the cases of  @xmath101122.524 and  @xmath101134.165 , the complex c components are contaminated by the galactic components of the   @xmath101121.975 and @xmath101133.665 , respectively .",
    "the contributions of these  lines to the absorption feature were determined from a cog fit to other  lines integrated over the same velocity range .",
    "uncertainties determined for the equivalent widths include error contributions from both photon statistics and continuum placement . in some cases",
    ", photon counting errors were estimated empirically from the data . for _ fuse _ data , where individual lines are often measured in two different channels ,",
    "equivalent widths are calculated by averaging values measured from the individual channels , weighted by a factor determined by their relative errors .",
    "when lines can not be measured , we estimate 3@xmath13 upper limits to the line equivalent width .    in order to measure column densities of the various metal species",
    ", we fitted a cog to the data .",
    "this requires the measurement of at least two lines for one species in each sightline .",
    "we are able to empirically determine a best - fit cog for five of the eight sightlines .",
    "the three sightlines for which a cog could not be fitted to the data have the lowest signal - to - noise , and the lines for which @xmath5 can be measured are highly uncertain .",
    "thus , to estimate column densities , and more often than not their upper limits , we adopt a cog with doppler parameter @xmath14 km s@xmath8 for the lower quality data .",
    "this @xmath15-value is generally consistent with those obtained from the sightlines with the highest quality data .",
    "the doubly - ionized species of s and fe typically reside in a different phase of the ism than neutral and singly - ionized species and are thus not well described by a @xmath15-value determined from species of a lower degree of ionization .  and",
    "in these sightlines have low measured values of @xmath5 , and their column densities are measured in the optically thin case ( spitzer 1978 ) by , @xmath16 we adopt rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths from morton ( 2002 ) except for several of the lines , where the oscillator strengths are from howk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "a significant problem in determining the abundances of these various ions is in obtaining the  column density of complex c along these sightlines .",
    "columns can not be determined from _ hst _ or _ fuse _ data , as neutral hydrogen absorption in the lyman series from complex c is saturated and blended with saturated absorption from the galaxy .",
    "a common approach in abundance studies is to adopt  columns from 21-cm emission .",
    "however , beam sizes in the single - dish data are , at the smallest , of order a few arc - minutes compared to the subarc - second effective beams in _",
    "hst _ and _ fuse _ quasar absorption - line studies . even over arc - minute scales , variations in columns can be significant ( wakker & schwarz 1991 ) and if  is clumped on scales of arc - seconds , then single - dish data will poorly reflect columns along quasar sightlines .",
    "our approach then , is to adopt  columns from the data of wakker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) taken at the effelsberg 100-m telescope which , with a @xmath17 beam , samples  columns on a far smaller scale than the lds 36@xmath18 beam .",
    "that survey includes   profiles for all of our complex c sightlines except pg 1626 + 554 , where we measure the  column from the lds data . for these sightlines , the   columns from the @xmath17 beam range from 0.19 dex below to 0.28 dex above those of the 36@xmath18 beam .",
    "we adopt this range as the systematic error associated with the beam - size mismatch , although it should be stressed that the difference could be even greater when extrapolating to smaller scales .",
    "future  observations of complex c at high spatial - resolution would be extremely useful to resolve this issue .",
    "metallicities are measured with respect to the solar ( meteoritic ) abundances of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ; hereafter gs98 ) .",
    "in addition , measured abundances from previous metallicity studies of complex c are revised using the gs98 abundances so as to make reliable comparisons to our results . holweger ( 2001 )",
    "has recently presented new solar photospheric abundances , the most notable of which is a low value of [ o / h]@xmath19 .",
    "the use of this abundance would increase our measured values of [ /]@xmath20 by 0.094 dex .",
    "we use  as a probe of cloud metallicity because the ionization state of oxygen is coupled to hydrogen through a resonant charge exchange reaction .",
    "previous studies ( wakker et al . 1999 ; g01 ) have used [ /]@xmath20 to probe metallicity , but have had to contend with ionization corrections , since , as we discuss in   4.1 , that quantity seems to depend on the photoionization correction as well as the actual sulfur metallicity .    in a number of cases we are unable to determine a metallicity based on [ /]@xmath20 due to contamination of the @xmath101039.23 line by galactic h@xmath11 ( 5 - 0 ) r(2 ) lyman absorption .",
    "in addition , the data quality for these particular sightlines precludes measurements of the weaker  lines in the 920 - 950   range of the _ fuse _ sic channels . we can estimate the column density of  along a given sightline at @xmath21()@xmath22 ( ) , where @xmath23 is the column density in units of @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the metallicity in units of 0.1 solar .",
    "thus in cases where [ /]@xmath20 could not be measured due to h@xmath11 contamination , we estimate the expected equivalent width of the  @xmath10948.686 line based on the derived or assumed cog for each sightline .    we have also made an attempt to measure molecular hydrogen in complex c. richter et al .",
    "( 2001b , 2002 ) previously analyzed _ fuse _ data for the pg 1259 + 593 and pg 1351 + 640 sightlines and were unable to detect high velocity h@xmath11 associated with complex c , whereas they find that molecular hydrogen is ubiquitous in ivcs where dust is more prevalent .",
    "in many cases we detect strong galactic h@xmath11 absorption , although h@xmath11 associated with complex c could not be measured within the sensitivity limits of the observations .",
    "_ fuse _ is typically sensitive to h@xmath11 column densities as low as @xmath27 @xmath25 . in order to put upper limits on column densities of h@xmath11",

    "the  upper limit is also quite low , and the 2@xmath13 measurement of the 1144.939   line at @xmath5= 81@xmath9339 suggests an  abundance below 0.1 solar .",

    "for the eight sightlines , we have calculated abundances of various ion species , , , , , and , which are the dominant ionization states in warm neutral clouds . however , there are certain to be regions in these clouds with ionized hydrogen . as a result , the measured column of  does not fully reflect the total column of h along the line of sight .",
    "this is not a problem for elements such as n or o , where the ionization state is coupled to that of h through charge - exchange interactions .",
    "elements such as s and si , however , are certain to be singly - ionized in both  and   regions .",

    ", we have plotted the runs of , , , and  abundance versus @xmath31 ( ) .",
    "the abundance [ / ] , and to a lesser extent [ / ] , shows a trend of decreasing abundance with column density .",
    "if one assumes that the elemental abundance does not vary significantly as a function of column density , then such a trend can be explained by an ionization effect .    in order to model the effect of column density on ion abundances , we have generated a grid of photoionization models using the code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "we make the simplified assumption that the absorbing gas can be treated as plane - parallel slabs illuminated by incident radiation dominated by ob associations .",
    "the models assume a @xmath113 k kurucz model atmosphere and a cloud metallicity of @xmath114 . while the extent of the incident ionizing field on complex c is not well known , h@xmath0 emission measures of complex c have been argued ( bland - hawthorn & putman 2001 ; weiner et al .",
    "2002 ) to be consistent with radiation from our galaxy at the level of log @xmath115 ( photons @xmath25 s@xmath8 ) , which we assume as the normally - incident ionizing flux in the models . for three assumed gas volume densities , @xmath116",

    "we find that the ionization corrections necessary for o and n are negligible , and that [ /]@xmath20 and [ /]@xmath20 should reflect actual values of [ o / h ] and [ n / h ]",
    ". it would be useful to check this for n by measuring complex c  @xmath119 .",
    "however , this absorption feature can not be measured in these sightlines since it is saturated and blended with saturated galactic absorption .",
    "given the simplified nature of these models and the uncertainty in the actual gas densities , these models are for illustrative purposes only and are designed mainly to explain the general trend observed in the ion abundances versus column .",
    "the models show that the spread in values of [ /]@xmath20 observed in these sightlines is more a reflection of ionization conditions in the cloud than actual variations in [ s / h ] .",
    "a similar statement can be made for the [ ] trend . for the intermediate density model ( @xmath120 @xmath121 ) ,",
    "the ionization correction to the [ /]@xmath20 puts those values more in line with the [ /]@xmath20 measurements .",
    "fe is not subject to as large a photoionization correction , which may explain the lack of a strong trend in [ /]@xmath20 versus @xmath31 ( ) .      in table 12 , we show the measured abundances , relative to solar , of , , , , and . as demonstrated in   4.1 , many of these ion species abundances are subject to ionization corrections in order to convert to elemental abundances .",
    "oxygen and nitrogen are particularly insensitive to such effects , and the values listed should accurately reflect the true values of [ o / h]@xmath20 and [ n / h]@xmath20 .",
    "we find that the metallicity of complex c ranges from 0.1 - 0.25 solar for the three sightlines in which  could be measured .",
    "the upper limits on [ /]@xmath20 established for the other sightlines are consistent with such a range . as stated by g01 ,",
    "the moderate abundances imply that complex c is unlikely to be representative of purely infalling extragalactic gas .",
    "further , we find that the metallicity varies from sightline to sightline ; the [ /]@xmath20 and ionization - corrected [ /]@xmath20 , within their @xmath122 error bars , suggest variations by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "although n is produced through different mechanisms than o , the two cases for which  could be measured differ in abundance by 0.7 dex , further suggesting that complex c can not be characterized by a single metallicity .",
    "metallicities in the range 0.1 - 0.3 solar are characteristic of tidally - disrupted dwarf - satellites ( lmc and smc ) or gas in the outer disk ( @xmath123 ) of the galaxy ( gibson 2002 ) . while the calculated metallicities are still somewhat low to assign a galactic origin , it is tempting to assign a mixed origin to complex c , with gas of galactic ( and/or satellite ) origin blending with infalling low - metallicity clouds .",
    "if this is the case , one might expect , with better data , to see a trend of lower metallicity with higher @xmath31 ( ) , since the mixing of infalling gas with enriched galactic disk gas may take considerable time .",
    "the interpretation of complex c metallicity may therefore depend on the alignment of the background agn with the cloud core or halo .",
    "we suggest that further _",
    "fuse _ and _ hst _ observations of many of these sightlines , together with higher - resolution 21-cm  maps , will more completely address these issues .    in order to further explore issues concerning the origin of complex c",
    ", we have calculated elemental abundances relative to .",
    "we consider data only from the three sightlines ( mrk 279 , mrk 817 , and pg 1259 + 593 ) for which an column density could be measured .",
    "figure 17 shows measured values of [ / ] , [ / ] , [ / ] , and [ / ] , where we have plotted the column density weighted mean values for the three sightlines .",
    "the upper limit for [ / ] is taken as the least restrictive of the limits from the various sightlines .",
    "using the ionization corrections discussed in ",
    "4.1 for the intermediate density model ( @xmath120 @xmath121 ) at log @xmath31()=19.5 , we can determine relative elemental abundances by adding an offset to the values illustrated in figure 17 . with these corrections",
    ", we find that [ s / o]@xmath20 and [ si / o]@xmath20 are consistent with a solar relative abundance . the fact that si is not depleted implies that dust is not a significant constituent of complex c. the possible absence of dust in complex c is reinforced by the non - detection of h@xmath11 , whose formation is facilitated by surfaces of interstellar dust grains ( shull & beckwith 1982 ) .",
    "the corrected [ fe / o ] is sub - solar by @xmath36 dex , which in the absence of dust depletions suggests a slight enhancement of the @xmath0-elements o , si , and s. we note that [ / ] and [ / ] are sub - solar . as a result",
    ", we can be reasonably confident in the corrected [ fe / o ] given appropriate corrections to  and .",
    "in addition , n is depleted by at least 0.5 dex relative to o for these three sightlines .",
    "evidence for under - abundant n is also apparent for the mrk 876 sightline , where is reduced by 0.8 dex from solar with respect to the @xmath0-element ion , much greater than any possible ionization correction along this sightline .",
    "the enrichment of @xmath0-elements relative to fe and the significant depletion of n suggest that the metals were produced primarily by massive stars and injected into the ism by type ii sne .",
    "the gas could have then been removed from the star - forming regions before fe and n production and delivery could pollute the ism . if the gas originated in a star - forming region with sufficiently correlated sn activity , then it could have been driven into the halo through chimneys ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) in a `` galactic fountain '' scenario .",
    "if the gas originated in the inner disk , then additional mixing with infalling extragalactic gas would be necessary to explain the metallicities .",
    "alternatively , the similarity in metallicity to the lmc and smc suggests that the gas may have been tidally stripped from the outer disk of the milky way or an unknown dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "these scenarios are all speculative",
    ". our study suggests , however , that the data are not consistent with a simple model of an infalling low - metallicity cloud of extragalactic origin .",
