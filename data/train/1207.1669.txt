    "the observation of parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry in experiments with structured optical waveguides @xcite marked a remarkable triumph for the mathematical theory of non - hermitian hamiltonians having @xmath0 symmetry , initiated by bender and boettcher @xcite in 1999 .",
    "the experiments exploit the optical - quantum mechanical analogy that the wave equation for the transverse electric field mode is formally equivalent to the one - dimensional schrdinger equation when the potential is identified with @xmath1 and the energy eigenvalue with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vacuum wave number and @xmath4 the propagation constant of the mode .",
    "a @xmath0 symmetric experiment is realized by introducing loss and gain terms in the complex index of refraction @xmath5 .",
    "a quantum analogue to the optical experiments would be a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well potential where loss and gain is realized by removing atoms from one well and pumping in atoms in the other , as has been suggested by klaiman et al .",
    "a complication arises from the interaction between the condensate atoms . in the simplest case",
    "this is s - wave scattering , which yields an additional ( real - valued ) potential term proportional to @xmath6 , and turns the non - hermitian hamiltonian into a nonlinear one . for the hamiltonian to be @xmath0 symmetric this term has to be a symmetric function of the coordinates , which can not be guaranteed from the outset",
    ". it will be the purpose of this paper to analyze whether or not the nonlinearity destroys the @xmath0 symmetry of the quantum system .",
    "we will do this , in the spirit of a model calculation , by considering the situation where the double well is idealized by two attractive delta - function potential wells , with loss added in one trap and gain in the other .",
    "we will demonstrate that the stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation indeed preserve the @xmath0 symmetry of the nonlinear hamiltonian , and merge in a branch point at some critical value of the loss and gain , beyond which the @xmath0 symmetry is broken .",
    "another model which simulates the physical situation of a bose - einstein condensate in a double well with loss and gain has been investigated by graefe et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of a two - mode bose - hubbard - type @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonian . in the model",
    "the dynamics of the quantum system is mapped on that of a ( formal ) spin vector whose motion on the surface of the bloch sphere can be analyzed in terms of classical nonlinear dynamics . as an optical analogue , in the two - mode approximation ramezani et al .",
    "@xcite have recently looked at a mathematical model of a @xmath0 symmetric coupled dual waveguide arrangement with kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it will be interesting to see which features of these models are recovered when actually solving the nonlinear @xmath0 symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "but to the best of our knowledge the basic problem of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with two @xmath0 symmetric delta - function double wells has not been treated so far .",
    "we consider a bose - einstein condensate trapped in two delta - function shaped potential wells located at @xmath7 , where from one well condensate atoms are removed and the same amount of atoms is added in the other . at sufficiently low temperatures stationary solutions for the condensate wave function",

    "the figure also shows that for distances below @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( c ) ) the excited state is born when loss and gain exceed a finite threshold value .",
    "the behaviour of the eigenvalues shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] is in complete analogy with that found by klaiman et al . in their study of two micro waveguides with loss and gain ( cf .",

    "what is shown is the evolution of the modulus of the ratio and its phase for the ground state and the excited state .",
    "since below the branch point we have @xmath46 , the modulus of the ratio is 1 , and the phase is twice the phase @xmath47 of the coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "as it must be , at @xmath33 the phase starts with a value of 0 for the ( symmetric ) ground state and @xmath48 for the ( antisymmetric ) excited state .",

    "they quickly evolve away from the values they have in the @xmath0 symmetric regime .",

    "we have solved the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpedimless ] ) numerically using a procedure in which the energy eigenvalues are found by a five - dimensional numerical root search .",
    "the free parameters which have to be adjusted in such a way that a physically meaningful wave function is obtained are the eigenvalue @xmath11 as well as initial conditions for the wave function and its derivative .",
    "since the overall phase is arbitrary we can choose it such that @xmath54 is a real number .",
    "therefore five real parameters remain , viz . the real part of @xmath54 , and the real and imaginary parts of both @xmath55 and @xmath11 .",
    "physically relevant wave functions must be square integrable and normalized .",
    "the normalization is important since the gross - pitaevskii equation is nonlinear and the norm influences the form of the hamiltonian .",
    "this gives in total five conditions which have to be fulfilled : the real and imaginary parts of @xmath56 must vanish for @xmath57 , and the norm of the wave function must fulfill @xmath58 .",
    "outside the delta - function traps the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpedimless ] ) coincides with the free nonlinear schrdinger equation , which has well known real solutions in terms of jacobi elliptic functions ( cf .",

    "it can be recognized that even with the nonlinearity present there always exist two branches of real eigenvalues , up to critical values @xmath66 , where the two branches merge .",
    "it can also be seen that branches of two complex conjugate eigenvalues also appear , but it comes as a surprise that these are born , not at @xmath66 , but at smaller values of @xmath10 where they bifurcate from the real eigenvalue branch of the ground state . as the nonlinearity is increased , the bifurcation points are shifted to smaller values of @xmath10 , while the branches of the real eigenvalues practically retain their form and are shifted upwards .",
    "we therefore find that for nonvanishing nonlinearity there always exists a range of @xmath10 values where two real and two complex eigenvalues coexist .",
    "this behaviour obviously is a new effect , caused by the nonlinearity in the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "in fact the different branches can be continuously transformed into each other : when , for fixed @xmath10 , we increase the nonlinearity from @xmath65 in small steps to @xmath67 and always take the solution of the previous step as input for the root search in the next step , the branch of complex conjugate eigenvalues which exists for @xmath65 is continuously transferred to the branch of complex eigenvalues for @xmath67 shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "likewise , starting from the branch of complex conjugate eigenvalues for @xmath67 at any value of @xmath10 in the range where four solutions exist and decreasing @xmath9 in small steps to @xmath65 we end up on the branch belonging to the real eigenvalue of the ground state .    at this point",
    "it is useful to compare with the results of the investigations of a @xmath0 symmetric two - mode bose - hubbard hamiltonian with loss and gain by graefe et al .",

    ", stationary states correspond to fixed points of the motion of a vector on the bloch sphere , whose types can be classified according to the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix . in the region",
    "where only two real eigenvalues exist the fixed points can be identified as centres , while in the region with four eigenvalues the fixed points correspond to a centre and a saddle point , and a sink and a source .",
    "the centre and saddle point collide at the branch point and vanish .",
    "this behaviour is in beautiful agreement with the results shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "a stability analysis of the wave functions shows that up to the bifurcation point both the ground state and the excited state are stable , they correspond to the two centres . beyond the bifurcation point",
    "the excited state remains stable ( a centre ) while the ground state becomes unstable ( a saddle point ) .",
    "out of the wave functions belonging to the two complex conjugate eigenvalues one decays and the other grows , corresponding to the sink and the source , respectively .",
    "it is gratifying that the two so different approaches qualitatively yield the same behaviour .",
    "it can be concluded that quite generally the familiar branching scheme for linear @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonians will be changed into a scheme of the type shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] if a nonlinearity is added to the hamiltonian .",

    "the fact that in the numerical calculation the global phase of the complex wave function was fixed in such a way that @xmath54 is real makes it particularly easy to recognize the @xmath0 symmetry of the two solutions , since their real parts become even functions and their imaginary parts odd functions of @xmath13 . from the @xmath0 symmetry of the wave function",
    "follows that the modulus , also shown in figure  [ fig:4a ] , is an even function , and with it the nonlinear term in ( [ gpedimless ] ) .",
    "we therefore have the important result that the nonlinear schrdinger equation with loss and gain selects as eigenfunctions exactly those states in hilbert space which render the nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath0 symmetric ! in the ground state , which emerges from the symmetric real wave function for @xmath74 , the symmetric contribution from the real part still dominates , while for the excited state , which originates from the antisymmetric solution for @xmath74 , the antisymmetric contribution from the imaginary part prevails .    the @xmath0 symmetry of the wave functions is broken for the eigenstates with complex eigenvalues .",
    "figures  [ fig:4a ]  ( c ) and ( d ) show as examples the wave functions obtained for @xmath72 for the corresponding pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues @xmath11 .",

    "the moduli of the wave functions also are no longer even functions of @xmath13 .",
    "thus we find that beyond the branch point not only the @xmath0 symmetry of the wave functions is broken but also that of the nonlinear hamiltonian !",
    "it must be noted , however , that eigenstates with complex eigenvalues , in spite of solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem ( [ gpedimless ] ) , do not obey the corresponding _ time - dependent _ nonlinear schrdinger equation . for complex eigenvalues",
    "the modulus squared of the wave functions grows or decays proportional to @xmath76 , and so does the nonlinear term in ( [ gpedimless ] ) .",
    "therefore strictly speaking multiplying these eigenstates with the usual time evolution factor @xmath77 only captures the _ onset _ of the temporal evolution of the two modes , for times @xmath78 . if one wished to obtain the exact time evolution of these solutions in the region beyond the branch point one would have to solve the time - dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation ( see subsection [ temporal_evolution ] ) . in figure",

    "thus also for strong nonlinearity at @xmath66 we find the properties characteristic of an exceptional point , i.e. the coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",

    "we have done this numerically by applying the split - operator technique , where in the short - time approximation the time evolution operator can be split into products of exponentials of the kinetic and potential terms of the ( nonlinear , time - dependent ) hamiltonian , and the time propagation is calculated by successively switching between position and momentum space .    in figure  [ fig:9 ]",
    "we show the results for the time evolution of @xmath91 of the initial superposition of the ground and the excited state @xmath92 , for the nonlinearity @xmath68 and different values of the loss / gain parameter .",

    "a surprising result is that , with the nonlinearity present , the branches of complex conjugate eigenvalues do not bifurcate from the exceptional point , but emerge at a smaller value of the loss / gain parameter from the eigenvalue branch of the ground state .",

    "<S> the time - independent nonlinear schrdinger equation is solved for two attractive delta - function shaped potential wells where an imaginary loss term is added in one well , and a gain term of the same size but with opposite sign in the other . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for vanishing nonlinearity the model captures all the features known from studies of @xmath0 symmetric optical wave guides , e.g. , the coalescence of modes in an exceptional point at a critical value of the loss / gain parameter , and the breaking of @xmath0 symmetry beyond . with the nonlinearity present , the equation is a model for a bose - einstein condensate with loss and gain in a double well potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nonlinear hamiltonian picks as stationary eigenstates exactly such solutions which render the nonlinear hamiltonian itself @xmath0 symmetric , but observe coalescence and bifurcation scenarios different from those known from linear @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonians . </S>"
