    "to obtain a complete picture of galaxy evolution , it is crucial to understand how the cold gas content of galaxies varies with cosmic time .",
    "cold gas ( @xmath14k ) , largely in the form of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) , is supplied through various accretion , merger and feedback processes ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and is later available to condense into massive molecular clouds and stars . without this gas ,",
    "star formation is quenched and evolution continues only passively . to improve our understanding of the evolution in quantities such as star formation rate density ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it is therefore fundamental to also improve our understanding of changes in the cosmic gas density .",
    "models that attempt to predict the variation of cosmic gas density with redshift diverge in their predictions .",
    "this is partly due to the wide spatial range required to track the requisite gas physics and partly because of uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation , in particular the action of feedback from stars and agn ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . thus , observational constraints are vital .",
    "a number of observational techniques exist for tracing hi gas within galaxies . at high redshifts ,",
    "the gunn - peterson effect applied to damped lyman @xmath15 ( dla ) systems can be exploited . @xcite and @xcite used sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra to trace systems with hi column densities above @xmath16@xmath17 at @xmath18 . though they find a statistically significant detection of evolution in the cosmic hi density within @xmath19 , interpretation of their results is problematic due to systematic effects such as dust obscuration and gravitational lensing",
    ". at @xmath20 the lyman @xmath15 transition",
    "is observed at ultraviolet wavelengths , making it difficult to trace with the limited time available on space - based observatories .",
    "@xcite were able to contribute in this regime by optically identifying dla systems through metal absorption lines in sdss data .",
    "they found no evidence of evolution in the cosmic hi density of dlas within @xmath21 , although their results are limited by statistical uncertainty .",
    "the preferred method for tracing hi in the local universe ( @xmath22 ) is via the direct detection of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm hyperfine emission line . with the wide instantaneous field of view provided by multibeam receivers on large radio telescopes , it is feasible to conduct blind , all - sky surveys at 21 cm",
    ". this has facilitated the detection of hi in large numbers of galaxies .",
    "a prime example of this is the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) , conducted with the 64 m parkes radio telescope in new south wales , australia @xcite .",
    "hipass detected hi within @xmath23 galaxies at @xmath4 @xcite , allowing the construction of the most reliable and complete hi mass function then available , and an estimate of the hi mass density for the local universe @xcite .",
    "similarly , the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey aims to detect > 30,000 galaxies at 21 cm out to @xmath24 over a sky area of @xmath117,000 deg@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "using the 40 per cent alfalfa catalogue , @xcite find a cosmic hi mass density 16 per cent higher than that derived by @xcite .",
    "they conclude that this discrepancy is caused by an under - representation in the hipass catalogue of the rare , high - mass [ @xmath25 galaxies due to sensitivity limits .",
    "deeper , blind hi surveys are underway , such as the arecibo ultra deep survey ( auds ) .",
    "this survey aims to directly detect significant numbers of field galaxies out to @xmath26 to probe the evolution of cosmic hi properties @xcite .",
    "however , the survey time required to achieve sufficient sensitivity at these higher redshifts restricts the observations to a narrow field ( 1/3  deg@xmath2 for auds ) , thus potentially introducing a strong cosmic variance bias .    to date",
    ", the deepest detections of 21 cm emission in individual galaxies have been made at @xmath27 by @xcite using pointed observations with the sensitive 305 m arecibo telescope , and by @xcite and @xcite using long integrations of cluster galaxies with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) . while future instruments such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) and its pathfinders should have the ability to detect 21 cm emission to much higher redshifts over large sky areas",
    ", these will not be available for a number of years .",
    "however , methods other than direct , individual detections are available to push the current redshift limit of hi observations . in particular , stacking is a useful method for probing hi within large samples of distant galaxies .",
    "stacking is the process of co - adding individual non - detections in an attempt to boost the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the data and thereby recover a more significant statistical detection .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that stacking can be successfully used to examine the environmental influence on the hi properties of cluster galaxies out to @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite were the first to apply this co - adding method to field galaxies to study the evolution of the cosmic hi density .",
    "they examined 154 star - forming galaxies selected in h@xmath15 at @xmath29 using 21 cm data from the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) ; however , averaged detections were 3@xmath3 at best .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used similar stacking methods to examine the impact of bulge presence and agn activity on the hi content of galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10@xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "they demonstrated that when using relatively low redshift ( @xmath33 ) hi data and a large sample of galaxies , strong stacked detections were possible , even for the subsample of galaxies individually undetected at 21 cm .",
    "the related technique of ` intensity mapping ' , which uses cross - correlation of radio and optical redshift data , has been used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to detect hi in samples at even higher redshift .",
    "the work presented here aims to constrain the cosmic density of hi out to @xmath34 and demonstrate the accuracy of the stacking method over this redshift range .",
    "we have employed the fast survey speed of the parkes telescope to collect 21 cm observations of a very large sample of field galaxies from the two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "the sample selection is not biased by environment , star formation signatures , or any particular physical characteristic other than the optical magnitude limits of the 2dfgrs . by using the wide but low - redshift hipass data , in combination with new , spectrally deep parkes observations of a smaller subsection of the 2dfgrs footprint",
    ", we can examine the hi content of galaxies over the full range @xmath35 .",
    "section 2 of this paper presents the optical redshift survey and the radio observations used in the analysis .",

    "we present an analysis of noise behaviour in the hi data .",
    "section [ sub : confusion ] discusses the influence of source confusion on our results and illustrates how we correct for this .",

    "trends in hi properties with redshift , luminosity and colour are measured in section [ sub : binning ] .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section 5 . we have assumed a @xmath36 cold dark matter cosmology with a reduced hubble constant @xmath37(100kms@xmath38mpc@xmath38)@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the basic principle of the hi stacking analysis employed here is to identify the positions and redshifts of galaxies using an external source catalogue containing optical redshifts , extract the hi information at these coordinates and then co - add the data .",
    "for the present analysis , the positions and redshifts are provided by the 2dfgrs .",
    "the 2dfgrs is a spectroscopic survey of over 250,000 galaxies conducted with the 2df multifibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "this survey covers two large strips , one in the northern galactic hemisphere and one in the south , as well as a number of small , random fields .",
    "the total sky coverage is @xmath112,000 deg@xmath2 .",
    "see @xcite for further details of the surveyed regions .",
    "the input photometric source catalogue for this survey comes from an adapted catalogue of automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine scans of the southern sky survey taken with the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "these target sources have extinction - corrected magnitudes brighter than @xmath42 .",
    "all apm @xmath43 magnitudes used in this paper are extinction - corrected , but not @xmath44-corrected for bandpass and evolution .",
    "these corrections will be incorporated into the corresponding redshifted luminosity density .",
    "as described in @xcite , the redshifts were estimated using a combination of automated absorption spectral shape fitting , emission line identification and manual input .",
    "each redshift was assigned a quality factor @xmath45 between 1 ( no reliable redshift available ) and 5 ( very reliable redshift ) .",
    "we find that sources with @xmath46 are sufficient for our stacking analysis .",
    "@xcite state that @xmath46 redshifts have a root - mean - square ( rms ) uncertainty of 85kms@xmath38 and can be used with 98.4 per cent reliability .",
    "we conducted a 21 cm survey with the 64 m parkes radio telescope over a 42deg@xmath2 ( @xmath47@xmath48@xmath49 ) sky field centred on right ascension ( ra ) 00@xmath5042@xmath5100@xmath52 and declination ( dec . )",
    "-29@xmath5300@xmath5400@xmath55 ( j2000 ) , close to the south galactic pole ( sgp ) .",
    "the region was chosen as it contains an overdensity of available 2dfgrs spectra ( described further in section [ sub : source - selection - sgp ] ) .",
    "this provides a high number of spectra per square degree available for a stacking analysis .",
    "87 h of telescope time was used for observations of this field .",
    "these were conducted on 2008 november 20 - 25 , 2009 august 17 - 20 and 2009 september 25 - 29 with an estimated 52 h of on - source integration .",
    "the observations used the multibeam correlator with two adjacent frequency bands , each with 1024 spectral channels over a bandwidth of 64mhz .",
    "the bands were centred on 1285 and 1335mhz with a 14mhz overlap to reduce the impact of the bandpass shape .",
    "observations in the two frequency bands were taken independently .",
    "the full frequency coverage of the parkes data is thus 1253 - 1367mhz over two polarizations .",
    "we therefore have the potential to detect galaxies with 21 cm redshifts in the range @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting channel spacing is 62.5khz .",
    "we also present a study using all overlapping data from the 2dfgrs catalogue and hipass .",

    "+ 25@xmath53 .",
    "the hipass velocity range is @xmath57kms@xmath38 , corresponding to a frequency coverage of 1362.5@xmath581426.5mhz and redshifts below @xmath59 .",
    "observations of the southern field ( below dec .",
    "+ 2@xmath60@xmath53 ) were completed over the period from 1997 february to 2000 march @xcite . the northern field ( dec .",
    "+ 2@xmath53 to + 25@xmath53 ) was observed from 2000 to 2002 @xcite .",
    "the hipass and sgp data sets overlap by only 4.5mhz ( @xmath61 ) in spectral range , making the two data sets highly complementary .",
    "both data sets were collected using a similar parkes scanning mode , where the telescope is actively scanned across the required sky area at a rate of 1@xmath53min@xmath38 . while hipass only used scans in declination , the sgp observations used a ` basket - weave ' pattern , with the entire field also covered by right ascension scans .",
    "this reduces the effect of negative sidelobes around bright continuum sources created by the bandpass correction . using this technique , the sgp field",
    "was completely surveyed 15 times in each spectral band within the available time frame .",
    "bandpass removal and calibration were conducted identically for both data sets using the livedata reduction package .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed explanation of these processes .",
    "the data were smoothed to reduce the effects of ringing created by strong galactic emission and/or strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , such as from satellites .",
    "hanning smoothing was applied to the sgp data .",
    "hipass utilized tukey 25 per cent smoothing .",
    "however , we have also applied hanning smoothing to the data for consistency . the spectral resolution after smoothing is 125khz ( 26.4kms@xmath38 at @xmath62 ) .",
    "the use of robust statistics in hipass data processing ( see section [ sub : gridding ] below ) was sufficient to mitigate against the majority of rfi .",
    "however , the lower frequencies probed during sgp observations suffer from greater rfi . to improve the quality of the sgp data",
    ", we applied an automated rfi masking routine to the reduced , smoothed data .",
    "the mean and rms noise levels were calculated in an rfi - free region and the resultant @xmath63 clipping threshold was set at 250.5mjy .",
    "all pixels with absolute deviations above this threshold were masked .",
    "this was not sufficient to completely mitigate against the presence of strong satellite rfi in the frequency range 1262.4@xmath581276.8mhz .",
    "it was not consistently present and appears in @xmath64 per cent of the observations in the 1285mhz band .",
    "therefore , the full range of affected channels was completely masked in all data files containing this rfi .",
    "this method was successful in recovering only the good quality data in the broad - band rfi zone .",
    "in addition , all data in channels around 1280 , 1300 , 1312 , 1316 , and 1350mhz were masked as they were also completely contaminated by satellite rfi .",
    "the resulting fraction of flagged data per channel is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfi - occupancy ] .    ]",
    "the reduced parkes data were gridded using gridzilla .",
    "robust median averaging was used to minimize the impact of rfi on the final cubes and the two polarizations were added .",
    "pixel sizes in the gridded data are each @xmath65arcmin@xmath2 . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "the sgp field is sufficiently small that it is reasonable to produce a single cube in each frequency band . to account for the band overlap ,",
    "each cube was cut at 1310mhz and the two were then concatenated together such that the frequency coverage was continuous .",
    "the rms noise per channel in the rfi - free part of the final data cube is 8.5mjybeam@xmath38 .",
    "the flux density scale is calibrated against 1934 - 638 and hydra a. calibrations are consistent to within @xmath66 per cent .",
    "since the sky coverage of the hipass data is so large , the southern region is split into 388 separate sky fields , each measuring @xmath67deg@xmath60@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the northern hipass field consists of 102 @xmath67deg@xmath2 cubes and 48 @xmath68deg@xmath2 cubes @xcite .",
    "the rms noise level of the hipass data is 13.3  mjy @xcite , which is 56 per cent higher than the sgp data .",
    "the effective spatial resolution of both the gridded sgp and hipass data sets is 15.5arcmin .",
    "there are 4,240 2dfgrs sources in the sgp field with high - quality redshifts ( @xmath69 ) covered by the 21 cm observations .",
    "however , not all of these are suitable for use in this stacking analysis .",
    "all channels within 2mhz of the extremes of the spectral range were discarded due to the bandpass shape , and the corresponding sources rejected .",
    "therefore , we have a final redshift coverage of @xmath70 for this sgp sample . additionally , sources were rejected from the sample if their redshifted hi signatures fell at frequencies with 100 per cent rfi occupancy in the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rfi - occupancy ] ) .",
    "continuum sources must be avoided as they can induce standing waves in the data @xcite and create a discontinuity between the two spectral bands . using the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) source catalogue by @xcite , the 17 continuum sources in the sgp field with 1.4ghz flux densities greater than 200mjy were identified .",
    "the 840 2dfgrs galaxies with angular separations from these continuum sources of less than the spatial resolution of the data were discarded from the sample .",
    "our final 2dfgrs sample therefore contains 3,277 sources suitable for stacking within the sgp field .",
    "the heliocentric redshift distribution of these sources is shown in fig . [ sgp_nz ] .",
    "many galaxies are distributed around @xmath71 and the average redshift of the sample is 0.096 .",
    "this ` clumpiness ' in redshift space is not attributable to a single galaxy cluster , but seems to be probing genuine cosmic structure .",
    "for example , the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group ( 2pigg ) catalogue by @xcite identifies 17 galaxy groups with 10 or more members at @xmath72 within the sgp region .    for comparison , the redshift distribution of the full 2dfgrs catalogue ( across the relevant @xmath73 range ) is also shown in fig .",
    "[ sgp_nz ] .",
    "it has been scaled down by the ratio of the full 2dfgrs and sgp field areas so the shape of the two distributions can be compared .",
    "the full 2dfgrs distribution is far more uniform across redshift and the ratio of the total source counts reveals that the sgp field contains an @xmath74 per cent overdensity at these redshifts .",
    "it is therefore evident that large - scale clustering is present in the chosen sgp field , highlighting the importance of cosmic variance considerations in such an analysis .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section [ sub : cosmic - variance ] .",
    "the full hipass completely covers the 2dfgrs footprint , but is limited in redshift coverage .",
    "there are 15,152 2dfgrs sources with reliable redshifts ( @xmath69 ) within the spectral range of the hipass data that are appropriate for stacking .",
    "this number excludes any sources with @xmath75 ( @xmath76  kms@xmath38 ) to minimize contamination from the galaxy and misclassified stars .",
    "we have removed the contribution of any galactic emission from all spectra by masking frequency channels between 1418.4 and 1422.4  mhz .",
    "our final hipass sample consists of 15,093 2dfgrs sources .",
    "the redshift distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ sgp_nz ] . according to @xcite , the contribution from continuum sources",
    "has already been suppressed in the hipass data by fitting a weighted average of the spectral shape near these sources and subtracting from all subsequent spectra .        for each 2dfgrs source in our final sample , we extracted the full 21 cm spectrum from the data cube using an optimal weighting according to the beam shape , centred on the pixel corresponding to the ra and dec .  defined in the optical catalogue .",
    "this extraction strategy optimizes the s / n of the stacked spectrum but results in an expanded effective beam width of 21.2arcmin ( @xmath111.6@xmath12mpc at @xmath77 ) for the sgp data and 21.9arcmin ( @xmath110.6@xmath12mpc at @xmath78 ) for the hipass data .",
    "we find one direct hi detection of a 2dfgrs source in the sgp sample with an s / n of 7.2 .",
    "the hi spectrum of this source is shown in fig .",

    "we split the parent sample into bins containing roughly equal source counts .",
    "we then stack the mass spectra of all sources within each subsample . by splitting the sgp parent sample into three bins and the hipass sample into eight bins",
    ", we can still achieve a statistically significant detection in each .",
    "tables [ tab : binning - sgp-1 ] and [ tab : binning - hipass-1 - 1 ] show the properties of each sgp and hipass subsample , respectively .",
    "the variation of the average hi mass and mass - to - light ratio in each bin is plotted in fig .",
    "[ flo : binned_plots ] .",
    "to minimize confusion in our results , we have restricted the measurement of both @xmath79 and @xmath80 to the @xmath81kms@xmath38 spectral range , as in section [ sub : cosmic - hi - mass ] .",
    "we have adjusted the luminosities to account for confusion ( via equation [ eq : lum_corr ] ) before binning .",
    "we have also used these corrected luminosities ( @xmath82 ) to determine the mass - to - light ratios .",
    "note , however , that it is not appropriate to apply the @xmath83 weighting ( equation [ eq : ml_weight ] ) to this binning analysis .",
    "the average hi mass - to - light ratios we measure are consistent with the results of @xcite who study hipass galaxies with optical counterparts identified in the 6df galaxy survey .",
    "they find that the @xmath43-band mass - to - light ratios of these galaxies are predominantly less than 5@xmath84 . for comparison ,",
    "the highest mass - to - light ratio we measure is @xmath85@xmath84 and is associated with the lowest hipass luminosity bin .",
    "we find that the hi mass increases and the mass - to - light ratio decreases with @xmath43 luminosity in both the hipass and sgp samples .",
    "the former reflects the fact that more luminous galaxies are often larger in size and therefore contain greater total hi masses ( eg .",
    "the fact that lower optical luminosity galaxies have higher mass - to - light ratios has been well established through direct hi observations ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and we have verified here that such trends can be reproduced with a stacking analysis .",
    "we have performed a least - squares linear fit to the hipass data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ flo : binned_plots ] .",
    "fitting to the sgp data is less robust , owing to the small number of bins .",
    "however , we perform the linear fit assuming the same gradient as the hipass fit . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ flo : binned_plots ] shows the close match of the mass - to - light versus luminosity derived by @xcite , compared with our results ( see also table [ tab : fit_parameters ] ) .",
    "this verifies our adjustment for the luminosity dependence of the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the only sgp point to substantially deviate is the lowest luminosity bin , which is the main reason for the slightly increased value of @xmath13 in table [ tab : ohi values ] .",
    "similar hi trends are seen with redshift .",
    "this does not reveal any real evolution , but arises because we do not have a volume - limited sample and are therefore preferentially detecting the higher mass and luminosity galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "it is precisely this bias that we are attempting to correct via equation in our above calculation of the hi mass density .",
    "we use the supercosmos @xmath43 and @xmath86 magnitudes , as defined in the 2dfgrs catalogue , to examine trends with colour . for the sgp population , which contains high - mass galaxies in each colour bin ,",
    "a higher total hi mass is seen for bluer sources .",
    "the hipass sample contains a range of masses at all colours , and it is therefore unfair to directly compare the hi masses in each bin .",
    "the large vertical offset between the two samples can again be explained by the preferential inclusion of higher mass sources in the sgp sample due to the magnitude limits of the optical catalogue .",
    "taking the ratio with the optical luminosity removes the galaxy size dependence , revealing a clear relationship between the hi mass - to - light ratio and colour .",
    "we see that bluer sources have higher mass - to - light ratios .",
    "again , we perform a linear fit to the hipass data , and apply this gradient to the sgp fit .",
    "both data sets are remarkably consistent and reflect similar trends found between colour and gas fraction in previous studies using both direct hi detections ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and 21 cm stacking experiments ( @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the notion that galaxies with larger gas supplies are generally associated with increased star formation .",
    "much of the colour dependence reflects the colour - magnitude relation and is therefore corrected for in our calculation of @xmath13 , which incorporates a luminosity correction to @xmath83 .",
    "however , it is possible that there remain residual differences between galaxies in the sgp and hipass samples .",
    "for example , @xcite examined the residual dependence of hi - to - stellar mass ratio on a number of parameters , and found that a simultaneous dependence on stellar mass and colour ( as well surface brightness and colour gradient ) best explains the properties of luminous sdss galaxies .",
    "however , after application of the luminosity correlation in table [ tab : fit_parameters ] , we find no residual dependence of @xmath83 on colour to an accuracy of 10 per cent over the mean colour difference between sgp and hipass galaxies .",
    "we have presented an hi spectral stacking analysis of galaxies identified in the 2dfgrs .",
    "we have shown that hi stacking can be used to efficiently and accurately probe the statistical properties of high - redshift field galaxies .",
    "our sample consists of 15,093 galaxies at @xmath87 and 3,277 galaxies at @xmath70 .",
    "21 cm data for the low - redshift sample were provided by hipass . for the high - redshift sample ,",
    "new 21 cm observations of a 42deg@xmath2 field near the sgp were conducted with the parkes radio telescope .",
    "many of the low - redshift optical galaxies are found to have strong hi signatures , consistent with the hicat .",
    "only one galaxy is detected above the 5@xmath3 limit in the sgp sample .",
    "we have co - added the hi spectra of all galaxies in our sample , after aligning each at the rest frame .",
    "we thus report a strong 31@xmath3 average detection of the hipass galaxies and a 12@xmath3 detection for the sgp galaxies .",
    "the sensitivity level we achieve for our stacked spectra is equivalent to observing a single object for @xmath88d .",
    "therefore , we have shown that spectral stacking is an effective method of making statistical detections of large numbers of individually undetected galaxies at high redshift with reasonable integration times .",
    "the rms noise in the stacked signal displays gaussian behaviour , decreasing with the square root of the number of co - added spectra .",
    "we find no apparent intrinsic limitation in the depth to which we can continue stacking experiments with the parkes telescope .",
    "this bodes well for future stacking experiments with deep , large - scale hi surveys on the next generation of radio telescopes such as the australian ska pathfinder , meerkat , apertif and ultimately the ska .",
    "we measure an average hi mass of @xmath89@xmath7 from the hipass stacked spectrum and @xmath90@xmath91 from the sgp stacked spectrum .",
    "however , we find that these averages , particularly that of the sgp sample , are over estimated due to source confusion .",
    "high - resolution follow - up observations to combat this issue are underway with the australia telescope compact array and will be presented in a future paper .    for",
    "now , we employ the tully - fisher relation to estimate source line widths and thus to predict the extent of confusion in our data .",
    "we then adjust the optical luminosities to include a beam - weighted sum of all confused galaxies . finding the average mass - to - light ratio and accounting for sample bias , we derive the cosmic hi mass density ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we find @xmath93 at @xmath4 and @xmath94 at @xmath1 , i.e. we find no ( 12@xmath1023 per cent ) evolution over the past @xmath95@xmath12gyr . within the error margins ,",
    "these values agree with previous @xmath92 estimates made via direct detections in the hipass , alfalfa and auds surveys .",
    "we argue that our results are far more robust to cosmic variance .",
    "finally , we employ the stacking technique to investigate the variation of hi properties with redshift , luminosity and colour .",
    "trends seen with redshift are obscured by selection effects .",
    "we find that lower luminosity galaxies have lower total hi masses but higher mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we also see a decrease in the mass - to - light ratio from blue to red galaxies .",

    "<S> using the parkes radio telescope , we study the 21 cm neutral hydrogen ( hi ) properties of a sample of galaxies with redshifts @xmath0 extracted from the optical two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . galaxies at @xmath1 are studied using new parkes observations of a 42deg@xmath2 field near the south galactic pole ( sgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> a spectral stacking analysis of the 3,277 2dfgrs objects within this field results in a convincing 12@xmath3 detection . for the low - redshift sample at @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we use the 15,093 2dfgrs galaxies observed by the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) and find a 31@xmath3 stacked detection . </S>",
    "<S> we measure average hi masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 for the sgp and hipass samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for source confusion and sample bias , we find a cosmic hi mass density of @xmath8 for the sgp sample and @xmath9 for the hipass sample . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests no ( 12@xmath1023 per cent ) evolution in the cosmic hi density over the last @xmath111@xmath12gyr . due to the very large effective volumes , </S>",
    "<S> cosmic variance in our determination of @xmath13 is considerably lower than previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> our stacking analysis reproduces and quantifies the expected trends in the hi mass and mass - to - light ratio of galaxies with redshift , luminosity and colour .    [ firstpage ]    galaxies : evolution  galaxies : ism  radio lines : galaxies </S>"
