    "schwarzschild s construction of a static explicit solution in 1915 was the first example of a solution to einstein s field equations in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "it has been found later that the class of static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solutions to einstein s equations in vacuum consists only of that element @xcite making it necessary to consider the non - vacuum field equations to construct further classes of spherically symmetric static spacetimes .      in this work we consider matter described as a collisionless gas . in astrophysics",
    "this model is used to study galaxies and globular clusters where the stars , or the galaxies , are the particles of the gas and where collisions between these are sufficiently rare to be neglected .",
    "the particles interact by the gravitational field which the particle ensemble creates collectively . within the framework of general relativity",
    "the particle system is described by the einstein - vlasov system .",
    "the mathematical investigation of this system was initiated by rein and rendall in 1992 @xcite in the context of the cauchy problem and shortly thereafter the same authors provided the first study of static , spherically symmetric solutions to this system @xcite . since then",
    ", the einstein - vlasov system has been successfully studied in several contexts and many global results have been obtained during the last two decades .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a review of these results but let us in particular mention the recent monumental work on this system concerning the stability of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend the class of static solutions to the einstein - vlasov system to the case with a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "several results on static and stationary solutions to this system have been obtained in the case when @xmath5 .",
    "the first result of this kind was provided in  @xcite , where the authors construct spherically symmetric isotropic static solutions with compactly supported energy density and pressure .",
    "the solutions are asymptotically flat and thus serve as models for isolated , self - gravitating systems .",
    "several generalizations of this result have since then been obtained , in particular solutions with non - isotropic pressure , and solutions with a schwarzschild singularity at the center , have been established , cf .",
    "an approac by variational methods was developed by wolansky @xcite .",
    "the most difficult part in these proofs is to show that the matter has compact support .",
    "a neat and quite general method to treat this problem has recently been obtained by ramming and rein in  @xcite . however",
    ", this method does not straightforwardly apply to the situation we consider in this work .",
    "the cosmological constant changes the structure of the equations and this implies that inequality ( 1.23 ) in  @xcite , on which this method is based , does not hold when @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we rely on a different method in this work . the results discussed above all concern the spherically symmetric case .",
    "let us point out that results beyond spherical symmetry have been established .",
    "the existence of stationary axially symmetric solutions to the einstein - vlasov system has recently been shown , cf .",

    "a specific class of solutions has so far not been discussed which concerns the einstein equations with a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "the model solutions for the vacuum equations are the schwarzschild - desitter and schwarzschild - anti - desitter ( schwarzschild - ads ) solution for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "einstein s equations with non - vanishing @xmath0 are of significant physical interest , where the case @xmath8 applies to a universe with accelerated expansion @xcite , while the case @xmath9 is relevant in the context of ads - cft correspondence @xcite . concerning the einstein - vlasov system no existence results for the static einstein equations with non - vanishing cosmological constant are known .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to prove existence of spherically symmetric static solutions to the einstein - vlasov system with small positive or arbitrary negative cosmological constant .",
    "the solutions we construct are in general anisotropic .",
    "the results provided in this work are as follows .",
    "we construct globally regular static solutions for small @xmath8 . the fundamental difference to the case of vanishing cosmological",
    "constant is that for large radii the metric tends towards a cosmological horizon and it is thus necessary to show that the support of the matter quantities vanishes before the cosmological horizon is reached .",
    "we show that for small @xmath8 the solutions we construct are close to the solutions corresponding to the @xmath11 case for which the matter quantities have compact support , and in addition , the latter solutions obey a buchdahl type inequality .",
    "these facts imply that the support of the matter quantities can be controlled also in the case when @xmath1 .",
    "it is then possible to continue the solution from the vacuum region by a schwarzschild - desitter solution .",
    "this method yields a large class of globally regular solutions which coincide with a schwarzschild - desitter solution outside a compact set .",
    "the result is given in theorem [ main - thm ] .",
    "the case of negative cosmological constant is a priori simpler since the cosmological term has a good sign which yields a monotonically decreasing behavior of the lapse function .",
    "an energy argument following the general idea of @xcite is used to establish global in @xmath12 existence yielding globally regular solutions for general @xmath9 .",
    "the result is given in theorem [ theo_glo_ads ] .",
    "to construct solutions with singularities in the center , we start with the vacuum equations which can be solved explicitly by the schwarzschild - desitter solution .",
    "this solution is considered until a radius which allows to continue the vacuum solution by one which at the same point satisfies the ansatz for the distribution function and eventually merges into a non - vacuum region .",
    "it is shown that the support of the matter quantities is compact and outside the matter region the solution can again be extended by a vacuum solution with mass parameter corresponding to the interior mass of black hole and matter .",
    "as in the non - singular case these constructions only work out for sufficiently small @xmath8 . the result is given in theorem [ theo_la_pos_bh ] .",
    "this point is similar to the case @xmath8 with schwarzschild singularities . in particular",
    "a smallness condition for @xmath13 is needed as well .",
    "the result is given in theorem [ theo_la_neg_bh ] .",
    "a significant generalization of the results with @xmath8 is presented in the final section .",
    "the periodic structure of the schwarzschild - desitter space @xcite allows us to consider solutions with regular massive center , and solutions with central black holes , and glue them to a periodic schwarzschild - desitter solution with a black hole region followed by another matter region - forming a static space - time with two non - vacuum ends and a black hole ( or several ) in between .",
    "the result is given in theorem [ thm - top ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prel ] we introduce the notation and give a short review on the static einstein - vlasov system in spherical symmetry .",
    "we discuss the anisotropic ansatz for the distribution function , variations of which are used in this work . a buchdahl type inequality , which applies to solutions of the einstein - vlasov system ,",
    "is then reviewed shortly as it is used later in the existence proof for @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein - vlasov system in spherical symmetry with a specific ansatz for the distribution function reduces to an integro - differential equation given in ( [ eqsimy ] ) .",
    "this equation lies at the heart of the analysis in the paper . in section [ sec : sagr ]",
    "we prove existence of globally regular solutions for small @xmath8 . the proof is divided into several steps beginning with local in @xmath12 existence in [ ssec : sagr-1 ] , a continuation criterion in [ ssec : sagr-2 ] , existence for sufficiently large radii to reach a vacuum region in [ secsupport ] and finally the proof of the existence theorem in [ ssec : sagr-4 ] . in section [ sec : sage neg ]",
    "the existence of globally regular solutions for arbitrary @xmath9 is proven along with a result ( cf .",
