    "the direct detection of gravitational waves is one of the most exciting challenges of current scientific research . the first generation of ground - based optical interferometric detectors , including virgo  @xcite and geo600  @xcite in europe , and the ligo  @xcite interferometers in usa , achieved design sensitivity and carried out several science runs , which set interesting upper limits on several classes of astrophysical sources  @xcite .",
    "the construction of a second generation of optical interferometers , advanced ligo  @xcite and virgo  @xcite , and the new japanese detector kagra  @xcite , is well underway ; thanks to the implementation of several technical upgrades , the advanced detectors are expected to come on line with a sensitivity about ten times better than first generation instruments . in the meanwhile , the conceptual design of third generation detectors , like the einstein telescope  @xcite , has started .",
    "for all these optical ground based detectors the sensitivity in the low frequency band , below 10 hz , is ultimately limited by the so called `` gravity gradient '' , or newtonian noise ( nn )  @xcite , whose source is the direct coupling of the test masses with any mass - density change in the environment , especially of seismic or atmospheric origin .",
    "atom interferometers ( see  @xcite for a review ) have been proposed recently as gw detectors  @xcite , on the basis of previous general ideas  @xcite .",
    "these instruments promise to be less sensitive to some of the noise sources affecting optical instruments : for instance , being the atoms in free fall , no direct seismic noise should be present .",
    "the effect of gravitational waves is a change in the phase accumulated by atoms wave functions , which can be detected by observing the interference of two atom beams .",
    "however , also the non - radiative gravitational fields of terrestrial origin affect the phase , in a different way as we will show : the question arises then , if the low frequency wall due to nn is relevant also for these new proposed detectors . in this paper",
    "we consider only the nn of seismic origin and we carry out a detailed calculation of its contribution to the sensitivity curve of an atom interferometer both in the single detector configuration and in the coupled differential configuration .",
    "it is worth underlining that this study is motivated by the different way in which gravitational fluctuations couple to atom interferometers and to optical interferometers , related to the fact that in the first case the test masses are atoms freely traveling across the instrument .",
    "we anticipate our conclusions : the atom interferometers are subject to nn in a degree similar to optical interferometers , and therefore will require appropriate technical solutions to overcome this noise limit in the frequency band below 10hz .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  sec .",
    "[ sec : generalformulas ] we consider a definite atom interferometer and we compute its response to a fluctuating gravity field ; in  sec .",
    "[ sec : singledetector ] we apply the formulas to the case of a single detector , deriving the limits on sensitivity ; finally in  sec .",
    "[ sec : differentialconfiguration ] we consider two atom interferometers operated in differential configurations .",
    "in optical interferometric gw detectors the test masses are suspended mirrors : a pendular suspension is indeed the best approximation on earth for a freely falling test mass . in atom interferometers instead",
    "the role of test masses is played by atoms in free fall , hence our intent is to determine the influence of the newtonian coupling to an external , time - varying mass distribution , on freely falling masses .",
    "some general considerations are possible : if the effect originates from seismic noise , it is driven by an external masses displacement field , whose linear power spectral density will generally have the form @xmath1 , mediated by a transfer function from the seism to the test masses motion behaving also as @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the angular frequency .",
    "therefore the effect on test masses is expected to be of the form @xmath4 , hence more relevant at low frequencies , where @xmath5 is a kind of reduced transfer function , depending on the detection device , and @xmath6 is a scale factor depending on the model of seismic waves ( it is recognized that the role of main source is played by rayleigh surface waves , especially the fundamental mode and few overtones  @xcite ) .    to derive the actual expression of @xmath5 for nn in an atom interferometer , we use the abcd formalism for matter waves , described elsewhere in detail  @xcite .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian of the motion for the atoms is at most quadratic in momentum and position operators @xmath7\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are vectors of momentum and position , respectively , whereas @xmath10 are suitable square matrices ( note that @xmath11 , with @xmath12 indicates the transposed matrix ) , and @xmath13 is the atom rest mass .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian represents the response to the local , fluctuating gravitational field @xmath14 : in the following , we will consider only the component along the direction of motion of the atoms , as in the paraxial approximation all transverse effects are neglected .",
    "the @xmath15 term allows to model the response to gravitational waves : in the fermi gauge , and considering fourier components , one can show that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gravitational wave strain tensor ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "consider an atoms beam ( a gaussian packet under paraxial approximation  @xcite ) which is divided and recombined through a sequence of @xmath18 light - field beam splitters , supplied by the same laser : from the first beam splitter to the last one ( the output port ) we may identify two paths , conventionally labeled @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by exploiting the ttt theorem  @xcite for the atoms / beam splitter interactions , and the mid - point property of gaussian beams  @xcite , the phase difference at the output port of the interferometer can be written as : @xmath21\\label{eq : phase}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the momentum transferred to the atoms by the _",

    ", we will also assume that the instrument is crossed by a plane gw with + polarization and amplitude @xmath33 , propagating along the @xmath34 axis , perpendicular to the plane of the interferometer ; we adopt in the following a description in fermi coordinates , which represents the best approximation to the laboratory cartesian system  @xcite .     units .",
    "[ fig : mach - zehnder ] ]    assuming the same stable frequency for the laser beams and neglecting the steady proper laser phases , the phase shift formula in  eq .",

    "[ eq : xipsi ] we have @xmath37 and we obtain @xmath38 we are interested in the low frequency range , where the newtonian noise is expected to be the limiting factor on account of its @xmath39 shape .",
    "we will therefore assume that the single atom interferometer has a linear dimension smaller than the wavelength of seismic surface waves , which we will assume to set also the coherence length .",
    "introducing the fourier transform @xmath40 of the fluctuating field we can also write @xmath41\\nonumber \\\\ \\psi\\left(t,\\ , t_{0}\\right ) & = & \\int\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}\\hat{g}\\left(\\omega\\right)\\left[\\frac{e^{i\\omega t_{0}}}{i\\omega}\\left(e^{i\\omega\\left(t - t_{0}\\right)}-1\\right)\\right]\\label{eq : xipsifreqdom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we assume , in the long wavelength approximation , that @xmath40 is the same at any point of the interferometer .",

    "we recall that @xmath47 is the unperturbed wave vector of the laser beam , corresponding to the impulse ( in units of the reduced planck constant @xmath48 ) transferred to the atom at each interaction point .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath49 the expression in  eq .",

    "indicating with @xmath50 the unperturbed distance of the first interaction point from the laser , and with @xmath51 the unperturbed momentum of the atoms , just before the first interaction with the laser beam , we recall that the fourier transform of the phase shift , as a function of the fourier transformed amplitude @xmath52 of the gw , can be written as @xmath53+\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\omega^{2}\\hat{h}\\left(\\omega\\right)}{2}t^{2}kq_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\omega t/2\\right)}{\\omega t/2}\\right)^{2}e^{i\\omega t }   \\label{eq : responsetogw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the proper laser phases have been neglected .    comparing with the expression of the response to a fluctuating local gravity field  eq .",
    "[ eq : phaseshift ] , we note that the second term of  eq .  [",
    "eq : responsetogw ] corresponds to it , with the substitution @xmath54 : however , the overall response to gws includes also a dynamic term depending on the atom momentum @xmath55 and on the momentum @xmath47 transferred to the atoms : hence the effects of the local gravitational field and of the gravitational waves are in principle distinguishable . for a single interferometer with the laser source close to the device ,",
    "actually the last term can be neglected and the more relevant one is the term proportional to @xmath51 , since we can also generally neglect the recoil term @xmath56 .",
    "this expression can be directly translated into a relation between linear power spectral densities ( lpsd ) , that we denote by a tilde , defined in terms of the two - point correlation functions as @xmath57 in which the angular brackets represent the statistical average . from  eq .",

    "it is useful to discuss here the scale of the @xmath63 lpsd , referring to typical values measured at the site of the virgo interferometers ; we recall indeed that we are considering the effect of an external fluctuating gravity field on freely falling test masses , which is the same situation experienced by the test masses of optical interferometers  @xcite ; even though the detailed shape of the nn affecting a instrument like virgo depends on the model for the seismic sources and the superficial earth layers , similar results are obtained in different cases , which can be summarized as follows @xmath64 where @xmath65 m is the length of virgo arms , @xmath66 is the displacement lpsd for a single suspended mirror , and @xmath67 is the measured lpsd of the ground seism  @xcite ; the factor @xmath68 takes into account that in virgo the noise due to the four end - station mirrors adds in quadrature .",

    "anyway , we obtain @xmath74^{2}}\\mbox{hz}^{2}\\,.\\label{eq : gnoisevirgo}\\ ] ] as an estimate of the scale of the fluctuating gravitational field seen by the atom interferometer .",
    "to appreciate the result , we show in  fig .",

    "the dashed curve represents the model newtonian noise effect on the virgo interferometer .",
    "]    the zeroes represent frequencies at which the atom interferometer is insensitive both to the gravity gradient noise and to gw ; note that the one shown is not a complete noise budget , to which other noises would contribute , particularly the atom shot noise which would exhibit peaks at those frequencies , not differently from an optical interferometer in a michelson configuration and without fabry - perot cavities .",
    "apart this specific feature , the comparison with a large optical interferometer shows a similar behavior as a function of the frequency , with a different noise scale dictated by the different linear dimensions of the instruments .",
    "we underline that for this type of atom interferometer , it could be unrealistic to increase the linear size @xmath75 even further : to this end , a differential configuration appears more promising .",
    "let us now consider the second term in  eq .  [ eq : responsetogw ] , proportional to the position @xmath50 .",
    "this term , already introduced in a different context  @xcite , is a sort of `` clock '' term which takes into account the influence of the gw on the laser beam , along its path from the source to a well defined physical point .",
    "its role was discussed in recent papers  @xcite and the most relevant new property is the introduction of @xmath50 ( path of laser beam ) in place of @xmath75 ( path of atom beam ) ; so , in order to improve the sensitivity , enlarging @xmath50 seems in principle easier than enlarging @xmath75 .",
    "this solution requires measuring the distance from the laser , and carries additional requirements on the coherence and stability of the laser beam , while maintaining it at a sufficient power density : it is therefore premature to draw too optimistic conclusions about the practicality of the configuration",
    ". however , the idea of adopting a two - interferometers differential configuration  @xcite appears very appealing in order to render the system independent from the laser position , and may furthermore yield a good common - modes rejection . under the hypothesis of a common laser source for two identical mach - zehnder atom interferometers in differential configuration , for which the relative distance @xmath76 satisfies the condition @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 the speed of light in vacuum ) , from  eq .

    "considering instead a low - frequency , long - wavelength approximation , it may be appealing the situation in which , even with two separated interferometers , the residual correlation leads to a partial noise cancellation in  eq .",
    "[ eq : hnndiffconf ] .",
    "we recall that the signals @xmath84 are assumed to be stochastic acceleration fields in positions 1 and 2 , projected along the direction specified by the segment @xmath85 as in  fig .  [",

    "we further assume to model the stochastic noise in the simplest possible way , namely as due to uncorrelated fluctuations in the density of the material surrounding the detector  @xcite .",

    "we first assume for simplicity that the space around the two stations with atom interferometers can be considered homogeneous : this could be the case for instance if the instrumentation is placed in a deep mine , at a depth much larger than @xmath76 .",

    "the residual correlation of the newtonian noise which affects the two atom interferometers , thanks to the shorter baseline , contributes to a milder growth as @xmath49 , and therefore leads to a sizable , though not dramatic , reduction of the noise over the virgo case .",
    "in this work we have evaluated the effect of fluctuations of the gravity field on the sensitivity of atom interferometers , thus providing an estimate of the so - called newtonian ( or gravity gradient ) noise for this kind of instruments .",
    "we have also found that operating two small - scale atom interferometers , linked by a laser , at a larger distance @xmath124 km , in differential configuration , as proposed for instance in  @xcite , there is an advantage at low frequency thanks to the residual newtonian noise correlation and the resulting partial cancellation .",
    "however , the noise reduction is not dramatic and the newtonian limit remains very significant : it is worth reminding that in order to detect a binary neutron star inspiral ( say , at @xmath125 ) sensitivities better than @xmath126 would be required at @xmath127 hz ; even for larger systems , say a @xmath128 binary black - hole coalescence , sensitivities of the order of @xmath129 should be achieved , as discussed for instance in  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , similarly to what is foreseen for future optical interferometers  @xcite , operating successfully atom interferometers in the @xmath130 $ ] hz frequency window will require mitigating the gravity gradient noise ; not just by choosing very quiet , underground sites , but also devising clever noise subtraction strategies .",
