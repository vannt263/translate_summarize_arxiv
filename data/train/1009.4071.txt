    "previous work on the phase diagrams of those models @xcite has been extended significantly and revised phase diagrams were proposed that respect the particle content of the theories .",
    "it was found that all of the above models exhibit crystalline phases , for many of which analytical solutions could be obtained @xcite .",
    "the gn model features a kink  antikink crystal at high density whereas the thermodynamically preferred ground state of the @xmath9gn model below a transition temperature is a  chiral spiral   a helical chiral condensate whose amplitude is determined by the temperature and spatial period by the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the phase transition is reminiscent of the peierls transition in 1d metals with the first band gap opening up at the fermi surface @xcite . while those models provide a rich playground for the study of relativistic field theories , they were not thought to have any application to reality due to their lower dimensionality .    in recent years , however , the expertise on those toy models has been used to study problems related to the ground state of qcd at finite density .",
    "thereby , @xmath1 dimensional models arise in the form of effective field theories when phases with lower - dimensional modulations of the chiral condensate are considered .",
    "such modulations can occur due to a strong external field @xcite or can be induced by the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "examples include work by shuster and son @xcite who  based on a dimensional reduction onto a variant of the chirally invariant thirring model  refuted the possibility of the large @xmath10 deryagin  grigoriev  rubakov ( dgr ) chiral wave ground state @xcite for @xmath11 .",

    "since the models in question are very involved , it is desirable to study examples of dimensional reduction isolated from the context of qcd . for this purpose",

    "we establish the equivalence of bcs theory of superconductivity to the massless gross  neveu model with discrete chiral symmetry on a mean - field level , provided that the chiral condensate does not break translational invariance .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the mean - field description of a well - known model from condensed matter physics which is used in the description of spin - peierls systems  the quasi one - dimensional extended hubbard model at half - filling  is equivalent to the massless generalized gross - neveu model with two coupling constants .",
    "in particular , we do not have to impose any restrictions on the symmetry of the condensate and the phase diagrams of both models can be identified .    on the one hand",
    ", we aim to supplement the current literature by elucidating the mechanism of dimensional reduction in the context of selected nonrelativistic field theories .",
    "on the other hand , we want to explore the fascinating applications of the gn model to condensed matter physics .",
    "furthermore , since hubbard models are extensively studied both analytically as well as numerically , our results might point to applications of those theories to the gn model .",

    "ii we give a brief overview of the basics of the massless gn model with two coupling constants .",
    "section iii presents the dimensional reduction of bcs theory onto the gn model with discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "the reduction holds only for homogeneous condensates .",

    "we give an introduction to the model and discuss its particle hole symmetry . exploiting this symmetry ,",
    "the dimensional reduction is formulated .",
    "a discussion of the cutoff dependence and comparison with selected experimental results follows .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary and conclusions in section v.",
    "in this paper , we consider the massless gn model with two coupling constants ( gengn ) , i.e. as defined by eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) with @xmath5 .",
    "while early work on this system was carried out by klimenko @xcite , the full revised phase diagram and particle content were worked out only recently by boehmer and thies @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the phase diagram of this model . according to coleman s theorem , any long - range order in 1 + 1 dimensions is destroyed by fluctuations @xcite .",
    "as shown by witten @xcite , those fluctuations are suppressed in the limit @xmath12 .",

    "hence , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath21 .",
    "renormalization can be performed using the conditions @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 where we set the scalar condensate equal to 1 .",
    "@xmath24 is the renormalized parameter that describes the imbalance in the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the case @xmath25 corresponds to the @xmath9gn model whereas for @xmath26 we recover the discrete gn model .",
    "the gengn model contains meson and baryon bound states . for a detailed analysis see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "at zero density ( small @xmath27 ) , there is a homogeneous phase with vanishing pseudoscalar condensate .",
    "a sheet of second order critical points separates this phase from a massless homogeneous one . since in both phases the pseudoscalar condensate vanishes , the critical temperature depends on @xmath27 but not on @xmath28 .",
    "a sheet of first order transition lines divides the massive homogeneous phase from a phase where the condensate takes the form of a soliton crystal which interpolates between the kink - antikink condensate of the gn model and the helical condensate of the @xmath9gn model .",
    "all transition sheets converge in a line of tricritical points .",
    "the onset of the inhomogeneous phase at zero temperature corresponds to twice the baryon mass .",
    "thereby , at low density and large @xmath28 , the condensate takes the form of separated kinks and antikinks and goes over into a sinusoidal shape for large density . as @xmath29 , the pseudoscalar condensate is less suppressed and the ground state oscillates between the scalar and the pseudoscalar condensate .",
    "it is interesting to note that chiral symmetry is never restored at zero temperature . in all cases ,",
    "the spatial period @xmath30 of the inhomogeneous condensate is determined by the first gap which opens up at the fermi surface : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the fact that a system can lower the energy of its ground state by opening up a band gap at the fermi surface is a well - known phenomenon in condensed matter physics where it was proposed by peierls for 1d metals @xcite .",
    "we start with the following observation : the phase diagram of the massless gn model was derived for the first time by wolff @xcite assuming only translationally invariant phases .",
    "the diagram is shown in fig .",
    "however , an equivalent phase diagram had been obtained by sarma @xcite even a decade before the proposal of the gn model when investigating the phase diagram of bcs theory in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the phase diagram of the gn model shows @xmath33 vs @xmath27 whereas sarma derives the critical temperature as a function of an external magnetic field .",
    "the massive phase of the gn model corresponds to the superconducting phase of bcs theory and the massless phase with restored chiral symmetry to the gapless normal phase .",
    "this indicates strongly that both theories are equivalent on that level .",
    "this section presents the proof of this equivalence .",
    "the electrons in a conductor interact via the coulomb interaction with the nuclei and each other . since the scale of the excitation in a conductor is much smaller than the binding energies due to coulomb interaction , the conductor can be treated as consisting of a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",

    ", we can linearize the dispersion relation @xmath53 the fermi velocity is defined by @xmath54 .",
    "all information about the underlying microscopic theory is absorbed in @xmath55 and @xmath47 .",

    "we are now able to exploit our mapping and confront experimental data with a full theoretical phase diagram for the first time . figure  ( [ fig4 ] ) shows a fit to data obtained by hase _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the inorganic spin - peierls system cugeo@xmath179  .",
    "the theoretical phase diagram is fit to the scale of experimental data .",
    "this corresponds to fitting the scale parameters @xmath180 and @xmath55 which are set equal to @xmath58 in the analysis of the gengn model .",
    "the phase diagram of the gengn model was determined in the @xmath27-@xmath33 plane for fixed values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 and the fit @xmath183 was chosen from this ensemble .",
    "in this work we explored applications of the gross  neveu model to nonrelativistic field theories . starting from the striking observation that the phase diagram of bcs theory and gross  neveu model",
    "coincide when restricting to phases with translational invariance , we were able to map bcs theory onto the massless gross  neveu model with discrete chiral symmetry on a mean - field level .",
    "we were able to show that the mean - field hamiltonian of the quasi one - dimensional extended hubbard model , which is widely used in condensed matter physics in the description of spin - peierls systems , is equivalent to a generalized gross  neveu model with two coupling constants .",
    "in particular , the phase diagrams of both models are equivalent including inhomogeneous phases .",
    "this model was worked out in detail only recently by boehmer and thies @xcite .",
    "relying on their results we were able to complete the phase diagram of the hubbard model and confront experimental data with the full phase diagram for the first time .",
    "it is interesting to note that although all models have been subject to intensive research over the last three decades the correspondence of the phase diagrams has not been noticed . in particular inhomogeneous phases of the hubbard model",
    "had been discussed long before the first phase diagram of the gross ",
    "neveu model was even proposed @xcite .",
    "this work supplements current efforts to use the expertise on quantum field theoretical toy models in the study of phases of qcd at high density by providing systems that can be dimensionally reduced most clearly .",
    "the equivalence of the gross  neveu and hubbard model might lay the ground for further work .",
    "in particular , analytical solutions for phases of the gross  neveu model with continuous chiral symmetry that do not affect the phase diagram might find a physical counterpart @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in baryon scattering and other dynamical phenomena in the gross  neveu model @xcite .",
    "the extensive analytical work over the past decades that was devoted to the study of dynamical phenomena in spin - peierls systems (  sliding  of cdws ) @xcite might be useful .",
    "i would like to thank michael thies for suggesting to work out a correspondence between the massless gross ",
    "neveu model and bcs theory .",
    "furthermore , i am indebted to him for many useful discussions and a critical reading of this manuscript .",
    "i would like to thank christian boehmer and dominik nickel for helpful comments concerning their work and gerald v. dunne for pointing out ref .",
