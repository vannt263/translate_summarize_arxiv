    "a type iib supernova has a spectrum with high velocity h lines near maximum , but in the late nebular phases more closely resembles a type ib supernova , with weak or absent h lines .",
    "the first supernova placed in this category was sn 1987k @xcite .",
    "however , it was the nearby sn 1993j in m81 that has come to best define the properties of a sn iib . in this case ,",
    "the progenitor star was identified as a k supergiant @xcite , consistent with the interpretation of the early light curve which required a stellar radius of @xmath2 cm @xcite .",
    "such a star is expected to have a slow , dense wind , and there is radio and x - ray evidence for a wind with mass loss rate @xmath3 for an assumed wind velocity of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "radio vlbi observations provide strong support for the wind interaction picture @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the dense wind also produces some h@xmath5 emission in the late nebular phase @xcite .",
    "a consistent scenario for sn 1993j is thus the explosion of an extended star that interacts with the dense wind from the progenitor star .",
    "however , there is also evidence for type iib supernovae arising from compact stars , and that is the topic addressed here .",
    "some of that evidence has already been presented for sn 2001ig @xcite , sn 2003bg @xcite , and sn 2008ax @xcite . in   2 , we present the differences between sne iib that have extended or compact progenitors .",
    "the results are discussed in   3 .",
    "the most direct way to observe the progenitor star is in presupernova observations . this has been possible for sn 1993j , as discussed above , and has recently been possible for sn 2008ax .",
    "@xcite find that the progenitor of the type iib sn 2008ax is either a single , he - rich , wolf - rayet star or a stripped star in an interacting binary in a low mass cluster .    the light curve evolution in the first days after the explosion , which is the time of cooling envelope emission after shock breakout , provides a good indicator of the initial stellar extent .",
    "the cooling envelope emission is more luminous for a more extended star because of the larger emitting area and adiabatic expansion losses are less important for an extended star .",
    "the early peak luminosity and first 10 days of evolution provided evidence for a large radius , @xmath2 cm for the progenitor of sn 1993j @xcite .    in the case of sn 2008ax , a comparable early luminous phase was absent in the light curve ( * ? ? ?",
    ". very early observations with _ swift _ did show evidence for an initial peak in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands @xcite .",
    "the luminosity level of the emission is comparable to , although slightly fainter than , similar emission observed in the type ib / c sn 1999ex @xcite .",
    "we used the cooling envelope theory of @xcite to model the @xmath9 emission on day 1.7 @xcite and the @xmath10 emission on day 1.9 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude results of @xcite were converted to fluxes using the flux conversion factors , pivot wavelengths , and bandpass widths for the uvot as reported in @xcite . for a distance of 9.6 mpc , a blackbody fit to the fluxes gives an effective temperature @xmath11 k and a photospheric radius @xmath12 cm on day 1.8 .",
    "taking an ejecta mass of @xmath13 and an energy @xmath14 ergs from the model of @xcite , equation ( 2 ) of @xcite yields @xmath15 cm , in good agreement with the observed value .",
    "equation ( 5 ) of @xcite and the observed @xmath16 yield a progenitor radius of @xmath17 cm . however , the temperature is sufficiently low that recombination is becoming important , so that the model of @xcite is inaccurate .",
    "the progenitor radius estimate should still be valid to within a factor @xmath18 , showing that the progenitor was compact , with a radius consistent with a wolf - rayet star .",
    "the radius determined here is that of the stellar envelope ; the photospheric radius may be a factor @xmath18 larger due to the stellar wind ( see fig",
    ". 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "although the explosion parameters for sn 2008ax are similar to sn 1993j @xcite , the progenitor is very different , as indicated by the progenitor observations and the early light curve .    for a compact star ,",
    "the cooling envelope emission lasts for only a few days , so that observations must be carried out very soon after the explosion for this phase to be detected .",
    "observations that rule out an extended progenitor may be the most that can be obtained . for the type iib sn 1996cb , there are light curve observations showing that an early luminous phase like that of sn 1993j was not present @xcite .",
    "circumstellar interaction depends on the progenitor radius in that more compact stars have faster , and thus more rarefied , winds and shock acceleration at the time of breakout extends to higher velocities in compact stars .",
    "radio emission is an excellent indicator of circumstellar interaction and fig .",
    "1 shows peak radio luminosity vs. time of peak for sn iib and sn ib / c .",
    "ssa ( synchrotron self - absorption ) is expected to be the dominant absorption mechanism for the high velocities present in sn ib / c and can be used to estimate the radio shell velocity at the time of the peak radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "the sn iib designation has been given to sn 1993j , sn 2001gd @xcite , sn 2001ig @xcite , sn 2003bg @xcite , and sn 2008ax @xcite .",
    "1 shows that there is a class of sn iib that have radio properties similar to those of sn ib / c , i.e. they have rapid radio evolution for a given luminosity , indicating velocities of @xmath19 .",
    "these velocities are expected for the explosion of a wolf - rayet star because of strong shock acceleration in the outer parts of the star and the low wind density resulting from a high wind velocity @xcite .",
    "they are designated here as sn ciib because of the expectation that they have relatively compact progenitors .",
    "there is direct light curve and progenitor evidence for this in the case of sn 2008ax , as discussed above .",
    "sn 1993j is placed in the sn eiib category because of its extended progenitor , as is sn 2001gd , because of its radio properties .",
    "in addition to the radio light curve information on sn 2001gd @xcite , there are also vlbi observations on days 286 and 582 from explosion , which combine to give a mean velocity @xmath20 on day 434 with 20% uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this velocity is consistent with that found from the radio light curves ( fig .",
    "1 ) and is somewhat less than that observed for the interaction shell in sn 1993j at a comparable time , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations of sn 2008ax @xcite indicate a velocity @xmath22 ( in a plausible model ) at an age of 33 days , supporting the ssa model .",
    "the highest h velocity in optical lines was only about half this , as noted by @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem for the type ciib case because the high velocity shocked h is nonradiative , as discussed below .",
    "the unshocked gas is of such low density that it is not seen .",
    "there do not seem to be sufficient early radio observations of sn 2008ax @xcite to test for ssa from the light curves , but in the case of sn 2003bg , there is support for the ssa model @xcite .",
    "the ssa model of @xcite can be used to obtain estimates of the mass loss properties of the compact supernovae .",
    "we characterize the mass loss density density by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and find @xmath25 for sn 2001ig , @xmath26 for sn 2003bg , and @xmath27 for sn 2008ax ; here , @xmath28 is the fraction of the postshock energy density in magnetic field in units of 0.1 and @xmath5 is the ratio of relativistic electron energy density to magnetic energy density .",
    "the results for sn 2001ig and sn 2003bg are the same as in @xcite and that for sn 2008ax uses the observations of @xcite . assuming that the efficiency of production of the radio emission is comparable for the different objects , the variation in the radio luminosities of the supernovae translates to a variation in the progenitor mass loss densities , by a factor of 20 .",
    "other type iib supernovae have been detected in the radio , but are not included in fig .",
    "1 because the available data do not allow the maximum luminosity to be accurately determined . however , there is some information .",
    "sn 2008bo showed optical properties similar to sn 2008ax , including deep h@xmath5 absorption @xcite .",
    "there were early radio detections of the supernova and a later ( age @xmath29 days ) rebrightening @xcite . at a distance of 21 mpc ,",
    "the radio luminosity was @xmath30 times lower than that of sn 2008ax and the emission became optically thin somewhat earlier , so this object extends the apparent wind density to slightly lower values .",
    "there are also 2 radio observations of the type iib sn 1996cb that indicate a @xmath31 frequency of @xmath32 ghz on dec .",
    "21 , 1996 @xcite .",
    "the observations indicate that it also lies on the @xmath33 plot close to sn 2008ax .",
    "x - ray emission is another signature of circumstellar interaction .",
    "@xcite find that the x - ray emission from sne ib / c is probably due to a nonthermal mechanism : inverse compton emission near optical maximum light and synchrotron emission at later times .",
    "the general expectation is that type ciib events should have nonthermal x - ray emission , while type eiib events similar to sn 1993j should have dominant thermal x - ray emission , as in sn 1993j @xcite .",
    "there are not yet sufficiently well observed type ciib events to test this from the spectra themselves .",
    "however , @xcite found a decrease in the x - ray luminosity of sn 2008ax from @xmath34 in the first month to @xmath35 in the second month .",
    "this is the magnitude of decline that would be expected in going from an inverse compton component near optical maximum to a synchrotron component a month later ( fig . 1 of * ? ?",
    ".    finally , another signature of a dense circumstellar medium is optical emission from gas heated and ionized by radiation from reverse shock heated gas @xcite",
    ". the optical emission can be either from freely expanding ejecta or from a dense shell formed as a result of radiative cooling .",
    "sn 1993j did show evidence for persistent h@xmath5 emission to an age of 2500 days @xcite ; the box - like line profile and other characteristics were consistent with circumstellar interaction .",
    "the early h@xmath5 emission from sn 1993j showed a decline consistent with a radioactive power source ; the late steady phase started at an age of @xmath36 days @xcite .",
    "the estimated wind density in sn 1993j corresponds to @xmath37 @xcite , which is a factor @xmath38 larger than the wind densities deduced here for the sne ciib .",
    "cooling is primarily by bremsstrahlung and the reverse shock is nonradiative over the times of observations for sn ciib .",
    "the low density and large shock radius imply that h@xmath5 from circumstellar interaction should be undetectable in the late nebular phase .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that circumstellar interaction powers h@xmath5 emission in the nebular phase from the type ib sn 2007y , even though upper limits on the radio emission yield @xmath39 . the explanation is probably that the observations are on days 230 and 270 , when radioactivity is still a plausible power source",
    ". observations of h@xmath5 at times @xmath40 yr are needed to distinguish between the steady emission that can occur in sne eiib and the continued drop expected in sne ciib .",
    "both sn 2001ig @xcite and sn 2003bg @xcite showed structure in their radio light curves that was interpreted as density structure in the wind region .",
    "@xcite suggested that the structure was due to a binary companion , as has been observed in the pinwheel dust structure around some wolf - rayet stars .",
    "@xcite in fact found evidence for a possible companion star at the site of the supernova . however , the star is of type late - b to late - f ; such a star would have too weak a wind to have much effect on the strong wind deduced for the progenitor of sn 2001ig .",
    "@xcite argued for stellar variability rather than a binary companion , based on the similarity between the radio evolution of sn 2001ig and sn 2003bg .",
    "the additional cases of type ciib supernovae also show evidence for wind density variations .",
    "the radio light curves of sn 2008ax show a peak in the optically thin phase at @xmath41 days @xcite . in the case of sn 2008bo",
    ", there is a possible re - brightening at @xmath42 days @xcite .",
    "there is thus evidence for density variations in every proposed type ciib supernova for which there are sufficient radio observations to show the effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the type ib event sn 2008d @xcite and the type ic events sn 2003l @xcite and sn 2009bb @xcite show smooth light curves . for sn 2003bg ,",
    "@xcite estimated that the time between the higher density outflows was @xmath43 yr , taking a timescale of 120 days to the first feature .",
    "@xcite took a timescale of 150 days and derived a period for the mass loss events of @xmath44 yr for sn 2003bg and sn 2001ig .",
    "the main difference between these estimates is that @xcite used an optically determined maximum ejecta velocity of @xmath45 at 14 days to determine the expansion of the radio emitting region , whereas @xcite used the ssa model for the radio emission to determine a mean velocity of about @xmath46 .",
    "as discussed above and shown by the vlbi observations of sn 2008ax , the highest velocity ejecta may not be detectable at optical wavelengths .",
    "the variability timescales for sn 2008ax and sn 2008bo are not well defined , but appear to be shorter than in the first two cases .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the timescale of decades is consistent with the variability timescale of luminous blue variables ( lbv ) undergoing s doradus - type variations and they propose such stars as progenitors .",
    "an example of such a star is ag car , which has been followed from its minimum ( hotter ) state through a cooler phase @xcite . in its minimum state , the mass loss rate is @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 .",
    "this is at the high end , but within the range , of wind densities discussed here for the type ciib events .",
    "however , the radius of ag car in its compact state is @xmath50 cm @xcite .",
    "this radius is a factor @xmath51 times the radius deduced here for the progenitor of sn 2008ax and the radii of wr stars .",
    "also , @xcite estimate a mass loss rate of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the cool state , so that the wind density is @xmath54 times higher than in the hot state .",
    "the density contrast is higher if the faster wind sweeps the slower wind into a shell .",
    "the shell densities are higher than appear present in the type ciib events and are closer to the shell interaction observed in sn 2006jc @xcite .",
    "s doradus stars with lower luminosities than ag car , which are more likely progenitors of the objects discussed here , have even larger radii .",
    "@xcite note that a wr progenitor is possible if the star becomes a such a star just before the supernova so it still interacted with mass loss from the lbv phase .",
    "however this would require the transition @xmath55 yr before the explosion .",
    "in addition , the fast wr wind would modify the close in circumstellar medium .",
    "finally , the ejecta masses for sne ciib are not particularly large : estimates are @xmath56 for sn 1996cb @xcite , @xmath57 for sn 2003bg @xcite , and @xmath58 for sn 2008ax @xcite .",
    "unless a considerable amount of matter goes into a black hole central remnant , these masses are less than expected for the cores of lbv stars .",
    "overall , the evidence points to progenitors for type ciib supernovae that are less massive and more compact than lbvs , and are more consistent with wolf - rayet stars .",
    "only a weak variation in wind properties is necessary to produce the observed radio variations .",
    "however , the possibility that the mechanism is similar to that producing s doradus variations in lbvs can not by ruled out .",
    "one expectation of the two types of iib is that the type ciib events should have a lower h mass envelope so that a large radial extent can not be sustained . for sn 1993j ,",
    "@xcite estimate a h mass of @xmath59 . for sn 2003bg ,",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath60 of h , in keeping with expectations . however , @xcite suggest that sn 1996cb has more h than sn 1993j , although @xcite estimate @xmath61 of h if the explosion energy is @xmath62 ergs .",
    "the implied dividing line between the types is @xmath63 .    for lower amounts of h",
    ", we expect that the type ciib objects merge into the type ib s .",
    "a recent example of a type ib with h is sn 2007y which showed high velocity ( @xmath64 ) h absorption near maximum light @xcite .",
    "the finding of h in the spectra of type ib events is common @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that a h mass @xmath65 is typically needed to produce the required optical depth in h@xmath5 . there may not be a clear separation of the type ciib and type ib events , but a gradual transition depending on remaining h mass .",
    "the cas a supernova was recently shown to be of type iib by the spectrum of its light echo @xcite , which raises the question of whether the progenitor was compact or extended .",
    "studies of the supernova remnant have not been conclusive ; @xcite argued that the progenitor was extended with the dense wind extending to the stellar surface , but there have been arguments for a blue phase before the supernova @xcite .",
    "the type iib identification was made on the basis of the close correspondence of the echo spectrum with the time integrated spectrum of sn 1993j .",
    "the h@xmath5 line in the echo spectrum appears to be closer to the maximum light h@xmath5 in sn 1993j than in sn 2003bg @xcite , but a more detailed comparison with the time integrated spectrum of a type ciib event would be useful .    the existing observations that allow a distinction between type ciib and eiib supernovae , primarily at radio wavelengths , indicate a clear separation between the 2 types of events , but the numbers are small .",
    "future time domain surveys should increase the discovery rate of type iib events so that this issue can be resolved .",
    "in addition , the early discovery of supernovae ( @xmath66 days from explosion ) will allow the classification of the events from their shock breakout and cooling envelope emission .",
