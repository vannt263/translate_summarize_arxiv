    "this article is concerned with the approximation of the distribution of markov processes conditioned to not hit a given absorbing state .",
    "let @xmath0 be a discrete time markov process evolving in a state space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an absorbing state , which means that @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "our first aim is to provide an approximation method based on an interacting particle system for the conditional distribution @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the law of @xmath0 with initial distribution @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",
    "our only assumption to achieve our aim will be that survival during a given finite time is possible from any state @xmath9 , which means that @xmath10 our second aim is to provide a general condition ensuring that the approximation method is uniform in time . the main assumption will be that there exist positive constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that , for any initial distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 this property has been extensively studied in  @xcite . in particular , it is known to imply the existence of a unique quasi - stationary distribution for the process @xmath0 on @xmath8 .",
    "another main result of our paper is that , under mild assumptions , the approximation method can be used to estimate this quasi - stationary distribution .",
    "the nave monte - carlo approach to approximate such distributions would be to consider @xmath16 independent interacting particles @xmath17 evolving following the law of @xmath0 under @xmath6 and to use the following asymptotic relation @xmath18 and then @xmath19 however , the number of particles remaining in @xmath8 typically decreases exponentially fast , so that , at any time @xmath20 , the actual number of particles that are used to approximate @xmath21 is of order @xmath22 for some @xmath23 . as a consequence",
    ", the variance of the right hand term typically grows exponentially fast and then the precision of the monte - carlo method worsens dramatically over time . in fact , for a finite number of particles @xmath24 , the number of particles @xmath25 belonging to @xmath8 eventually vanishes in finite time with probability one .",
    "thus the right hand term in the above equation eventually becomes undefined .",
    "since we re typically interested in the long time behavior of   or in methods that need to evolve without interruption for a long time , the nave monte carlo method is definitely not well suited to fulfill our objective .    in order to overcome this difficulty , modified monte - carlo methods",
    "have been introduced in the recent past years by  del moral for discrete time markov processes ( see for instance  @xcite or the well documented web page  @xcite , with many applications of such modified monte - carlo method ) .",
    "the main idea is to consider independent particles @xmath26 evolving in @xmath8 following the law of @xmath0 , but such that , at each time @xmath27 , any absorbed particle is re - introduced to the position of one other particle , chosen uniformly among those remaining in @xmath8 ; then the particles evolve independently from each others and so on .",
    "while this method is powerful , one drawback is that , at some random time @xmath28 , all the particles will eventually be absorbed simultaneously . at this time ,",
    "the interacting particle system is stopped and there is no natural way to reintroduce all the particles at time @xmath29 .",
    "when the number of particles is large and the probability of absorption is uniformly bounded away from zero , the time @xmath28 is typically very large and this explain the great success of this method .",
    "however , many situations does not enter the scope of these assumptions , such as diffusion processes picked at discrete times or the neutron transport approximation ( see section  [ sec : example_neutron ] ) .",
    "our method is non - failable in these situations .",
    "moreover the uniform convergence theorem provided in section  [ sec : main2 ] also holds in these cases , under suitable assumptions .",
    "when the underlying process is a continuous time process , one alternative to the methods of  @xcite has been introduced recently .",
    "the idea is to consider a continuous time @xmath24-particles system , where the particles evolve independently until one ( and only one ) of them is absorbed . at this time , the unique absorbed particle is re - introduced to the position of one other particle , chosen uniformly among those remaining in @xmath8 .",
    "this continuous time system , introduced by  burdzy , holyst , ingermann and march ( see for instance  @xcite ) , can be used to approximate the distribution of diffusion processes conditioned not to hit a boundary .",
    "unfortunately , it yields two new difficulties .",
    "the first one is that it only works if the number of jumps does not explode in finite time almost surely ( which is not always the case even in non - trivial situations , see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the second one is that , when it is implemented numerically , one has to compute the exact absorption time of each particles , which can be cumbersome for diffusion processes and complicated boundaries .",
    "note that , when this difficulties are overcome , the empirical distribution of the process is known to converge to the conditional distribution ( see for instance the general result  @xcite and the particular cases handled in  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it appears that both methods are not applicable in the generality we aim to achieve in the present paper and , in some cases , both method will fail ( as in the case of the neutron transport example of section  [ sec : example_neutron ] ) .",
    "let us now describe the original algorithm studied in the present paper .",
    "fix @xmath30 .",
    "the particle system that we introduce is a discrete time markov process @xmath31 evolving in @xmath32 .",
    "we describe its dynamic between two successive times @xmath33 and @xmath34 , knowing @xmath35 , by considering the following random algorithm which act on any @xmath24-uplet of the form @xmath36    * algorithm 1 . * initiate @xmath37 by setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and repeat the following steps until @xmath41 for all @xmath40 .    1 .",

    "our first main result , stated in section  [ sec : main1 ] , is that , for all @xmath20 , the empirical distribution of the particle system evolving following the above dynamic actually converges to the conditional distribution of the original process @xmath0 at time @xmath33 .",
    "we prove this result by building a continuous time markov process @xmath54 such that @xmath55 is distributed as @xmath56 for all entire time @xmath27 , and such that the general convergence result of  @xcite applies .",

    "first , we provide an implementation of algorithm  1 as the discrete time included chain of a continuous time fleming - viot type particle system .",
    "in particular , this step provides a mathematically tractable implementation of algorithm  1 . in a second step ,",
    "we use existing results on fleming - viot type particle systems to deduce that the empirical distribution of the particle system converges to the conditional distribution  .",

    "the @xmath24 particles evolve as @xmath24 independent copies of @xmath86 until one of them reaches @xmath89 .",
    "note that it is clear from the definition of @xmath86 that only one particle jumps at this time .",

    "indeed , at any time @xmath20 , the fleming - viot system is defined so that @xmath102 then , at each time @xmath81 , the index of the next moving particle @xmath103 belongs to the set of particles @xmath104 such that @xmath105 . moreover , conditionally to @xmath106 , the jumping times of these particles are independent and identically distributed ( uniformly on @xmath107 ) . as a consequence @xmath108",
