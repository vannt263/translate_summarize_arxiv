    "questions concerning possible phases of strongly interacting matter and transitions between them have been motivating experimental and theoretical study of relativistic nuclear collisions for many years now  @xcite .",
    "results on collision energy dependence of hadron production properties in central lead ",
    "lead ( pb+pb ) collisions indicate that a high density phase of strongly interacting matter , a quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is produced at an early stage of collisions at energies higher than about 8  gev ( center of mass energy per nucleon  nucleon pair )  @xcite .",
    "signals of the onset of deconfinement are not observed in proton  proton ( p+p ) interactions .",
    "this is probably because of a small volume of the created system . also , in other cases , when interpreting signatures of the onset of deconfinement and/or qgp in nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( a+a ) collisions it is popular to refer to a comparison with properly normalized data on p+p interactions at the same collision energy per nucleon .    statistical models in thermodynamical approximation are , in general , sufficient to describe mean particle multiplicities in central pb+pb collisions at high energies .",
    "this is because the volume of the created matter is large and therefore an influence of the material and motional conservation laws can be neglected . on the other hand , data on p+p interactions",
    "are notoriously difficult to interpret within statistical approaches .",
    "this should be attributed to an importance of the conservation laws and thus invalidity of thermodynamic models . instead of the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , the canonical ( ce ) or micro - canonical ( mce )",
    "ones should be used . of course",
    ", this may also impact conclusions from a comparison of results on pb+pb and p+p interactions as well as the study of system size dependence in a+a collisions .",
    "an influence of material conservation laws on particle yields has been studied within the ce since a long time @xcite . in particular , strangeness",
    "@xcite , baryon number  @xcite , and charm  @xcite conservation laws were considered separately in detail .",
    "a complete treatment of the exact material conservation laws within the ce and mce formulations was developed and applied to analyze hadron yields in elementary collisions  in refs .",
    "the main result is that the density of conserved charge carriers decreases with decreasing system volume .",
    "this so  called ce suppression becomes significant for a mean multiplicity of conserved charges of the order of one .",
    "similar to the ce suppression of particle yields , one may expect that a shape of single particle momentum spectra changes when energy and momentum conservation laws are imposed .",
    "this conjecture is addressed quantitatively in our paper in which three micro - canonical statistical ensembles , namely , with conserved system energy , system momentum as well as system energy and momentum , are considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "partition functions for the three ensembles are defined and calculated in section ii .",
    "the corresponding single particle momentum spectra are shown and discussed in section iii .",
    "summary presented in section iv closes the paper .",
    "for simplicity , a non  interacting gas of mass - less particles ( without conserved charges ) will be studied . moreover , the classical boltzmann approximation , which neglects ( small ) quantum effects , will be used .",
    "this allows to derive analytical formulas for single particle spectra in three micro - canonical statistical ensembles .",
    "these are ensembles with the fixed volume , @xmath0 , and conserved system energy @xmath1 only , system momentum @xmath2 only as well as @xmath1 and @xmath2 being conserved together .",
    "they are referred to as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ensembles , respectively , where @xmath6 denotes the system temperature . for comparison",

    "as it is intuitively expected , the partition functions ( [ zep ] ) and ( [ ztp ] ) depend on the absolute value @xmath23 of the 3-vector @xmath2 , and they are independent of the @xmath2 direction . for @xmath24 , from eqs .",

    "( [ fep ] ) and  ( [ ftp ] ) , respectively , were used .",
    "note also that the spectra ( [ ft][ftp ] ) satisfy the same normalization condition : @xmath31    the single particle momentum spectra obtained within the @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ensembles are shown in fig .",
    "they are calculated for @xmath32  mev and @xmath33  gev in the @xmath7 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , @xmath5 ensembles , respectively .",
    "the average multiplicity in the gce is selected to be @xmath34 .",
    "note , that the selected mean multiplicity and temperature are close to those measured in p+p interactions at the lhc energies .",
    "the energy in the @xmath3 and @xmath5 ensembles was set to be equal to the mean energy in the @xmath7 ensemble , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the gce relation @xmath36 was used to obtain the volume @xmath0 , which is used in all ensembles . for these values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and",
    "@xmath6 the average multiplicities ( [ nav ] ) in @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ensembles are then approximately equal to that in the gce .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , at high momenta the spectra calculated imposing energy and/or momentum conservation are significantly below the gce exponential spectrum .",
    "this is expected because at the threshold momentum the particle yield has to equal zero , namely , @xmath37 at @xmath38 , and @xmath39 at @xmath40 .    in order to quantify impact of the energy and momentum conservation at momenta significantly below the threshold one ,",
    "the ratio of the spectra in the @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 ensembles to the spectrum in the @xmath7 ensemble is shown in fig .",
    "the suppression of the spectra due to the energy and momentum conservation is already significant ( a factor of about 2 ) at momentum @xmath41  gev / c which is as low as about 12.5% of the threshold one .",
    "note , that the ratio is lower than the one by @xmath42% at low momenta of several hundred mev / c as a result of the suppression of the spectra ( [ fe][ftp ] ) at higher momenta and their normalization to unity , eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .",
    "dependence of the ratio @xmath43 at @xmath44  gev / c on mean particle multiplicity is shown in fig .",
    "the temperature is fixed as @xmath45  mev .",
    "the energy and volume are calculated as @xmath35 and @xmath46 , and they have the same values in all statistical ensembles . for small statistical systems ( at low @xmath47 ) the effect of the energy  momentum conservation is strong and the ratio @xmath43 is large",
    ". the ratio decreases to unity with increasing @xmath48 for all three ensembles with conserved @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 .",
    "this is expected , because in the thermodynamical limit an influence of the energy ",
    "momentum conservation on single particle momentum spectra at any fixed particle momentum should disappear .",
    "note , that in the @xmath3 and @xmath5 ensembles , @xmath49 at the threshold values of @xmath50 equal to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "single particle momentum spectra are calculated in the system of mass - less non  interacting boltzmann particles within three micro - canonical statistical ensembles , namely , with the conserved system energy , system momentum , as well as system energy and momentum .",
    "we find a strong suppression of the spectra at large momenta in comparison to the exponential spectrum of the grand canonical ( t , v ) ensemble . in the @xmath3 and @xmath55 ensembles",
    "the spectra approach zero for momentum approaching its threshold value , @xmath38 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "there is no threshold in the @xmath56 ensemble , nevertheless the spectrum is also strongly suppressed . for the mean particle multiplicity and temperature typical for p+p interactions at the lhc energy , the suppression of the spectra due to",
    "the energy and momentum conservation is already significant ( a factor of about 2 ) at @xmath44  gev / c , i.e. at momenta as low as about 12.5% of the threshold momentum for the @xmath55 ensemble .",
    "the results of this work are relevant in a study of the system size and collision energy dependence of transverse momentum spectra in nuclear collisions at high energies .",
    "in particular , an interpretation of differences between spectra from p+p interactions and central pb+pb collisions should take into account a possibly strong impact of the energy  momentum conservation .",
