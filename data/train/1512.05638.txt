    "there has been significant development in the efficient implementation and analysis of the model order reduction ( mor ) techniques for parametrized partial differential equations ( pdes ) @xcite . even though the pod is a very successful mor technique for linear problems , for nonlinear problems",
    "the computational complexity of the evaluation of the nonlinear reduced model still depends on the dimension of the fom .",
    "several methods are developed to reduce the computational cost so that the nonlinear function evaluations are independent of the dimension of the fom and the computational complexity is proportional to the dimension of rom .",
    "the discrete empirical interpolation method ( deim ) @xcite which is the modified version of the empirical interpolation method ( eim ) @xcite are the most frequently used ones .",
    "the deim was originally developed for nonlinear functions which depend component - wise on single variables , arising from the finite difference discretization of nonlinear pdes @xcite .",
    "when the nonlinear functions are discretized by finite elements , the discretized nonlinear functions depend on the mesh and on the polynomial degree of the finite elements .",
    "therefore the efficiency of the pod - deim can be degraded . in @xcite",
    "the deim was applied at different stages of the finite element assembly process . using the unassembled finite elements , where each deim point is related to a single element ,",
    "the number of nonlinear function calls during the online computation is reduced , but the size of the nonlinear snapshots are enlarged , which increases the offline computational cost @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the dg discretization for time dependent parametrized semi - linear pdes . due to the local nature of the dg approximation ,",
    "each component of the discretized nonlinear vectors depend only on few elements in the local mesh , whereas the continuous fems discretized nonlinear vectors depend on multiple components of the finite element solutions .",
    "therefore the number of pod - deim function evaluations for dg approximation is comparable with the finite difference discretization .    in this paper",
    "we consider the parametrized fhn equation @xcite with fast diffusing inhibitor @xmath0    [ fhn ] @xmath1    on a space - time cylinder @xmath2 $ ] with homogeneous ( zero - flux ) neumann boundary conditions . the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the activator and inhibitor , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents the bistable nonlinearity for the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we investigate the formation of labyrinth and spot like patterns for different values of the parameter @xmath6 as in @xcite , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and diffusion coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath10 are fixed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the discretization of fhn equation in space by symmetric interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method ( sipg )",
    "in section 3 the rom based on the pod is formulated . in section 4",
    "we describe the sipg discretized version of the deim for the bistable nonlinearity .",
    "numerical results for pattern formations for different values of the parameters demonstrate the good performance of dg roms .",
