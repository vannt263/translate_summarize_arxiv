    "the heat capacity has served as a fundamental probe to the structure of matter already since the early days of statistical mechanics .",
    "we may remind its role in the formation of quantum physics .",
    "being sensitive to the number and character of the microscopic degrees of freedom activated in the system at a given temperature , the heat capacity represents an important tool of theoretical , experimental and also applied research up to the present days @xcite .",
    "thermal properties of condensed matter systems are mostly studied in the thermodynamic limit , in which the number of particles as well as the number of degrees of freedom ( ) grow to infinity . however , with the advent of experiments based on controlled quantum devices ( like cold atom or quantum electrodynamical setups @xcite ) , the thermodynamics of systems with limited numbers of effective  becomes relevant . in such systems , the measure of size ( e.g. , number of particles ) is not directly related to the number of relevant , the latter including only a limited set of collective coordinates which play an active role in the given arrangement .",
    "the infinite - size limit of such systems can have rather unusual thermodynamic properties .",
    "an interesting phenomenon that occurs in the infinite - size limit of finite-  systems is the excited - state quantum phase transition ( ) .",
    "it is a singularity of the density and flow of the quantum spectrum as a function of excitation energy and suitable control parameters @xcite .",
    "the  extend the ground - state quantum phase transitions at zero temperature ( ) @xcite and their possible links to thermal phase transitions were naturally considered .",
    "although recent analyses @xcite showed that a thermal phase transition in the dicke model of single - mode superradiance is related to the  rather than  present in that model , it was not clear to what extent this conclusion relied on the particular features of the specific system under study .",
    "in this work , we proceed in the investigation of thermodynamic consequences of  using the canonical and microcanonical heat capacity .",
    "this quantity is a natural choice in such an analysis because of its ability to indicate thermal phase transitions .",
    "we show that the presence of an  in the spectrum does not generate any singularity of the canonical heat capacity , which basically confirms results of the previous analyses . at the same time",
    ", we observe the presence of -related singularities in the microcanonical heat capacity and demonstrate dramatic discrepancies between canonical and microcanonical descriptions in the systems with .",
    "here is a plan of the paper : the formulas for canonical and microcanonical heat capacity are outlined in sec.[sec : camic ] .",
    "heat capacities in presence of  for various  numbers are analyzed in sec.[sec : esqptcgen ] .",
    "numerical examples are discussed in sec.[sec : esqptcnum ] .",
    "a summary is given in sec.[sec : conc ] .",
    "from elementary statistical mechanics we know that descriptions based on the microcanonical , canonical and grandcanonical ensembles become equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , but away from that limit they provide rather different pictures of reality @xcite .",
    "microcanonical thermodynamics , which is based on the original boltzmann definition of entropy , represents an adequate approach to the equilibrium state of virtually isolated systems with a finite ( moderate ) number of elementary constituents .",
    "it is therefore considered as the most natural background for the theory of phase transitions in finite systems @xcite .",
    "our present motivation for invoking canonical and microcanonical approaches is nevertheless not the same as outlined above .",
    "we show that concerning the validity of these approaches , the key question is not only whether the system is in the thermodynamic limit , but also which kind of limit it is .",
    "we focus on systems that can be called infinite and finite at the same time : _ infinite _ in the sense of an asymptotically large size parameter @xmath0 , and _",
    "finite _ for the number @xmath1 of effective  remains constant ( preferably small ) regardless of @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the canonical and microcanonical descriptions of such systems may give rather different predictions even in the ( incomplete ) @xmath2 .",
    "this general conclusion can be most clearly demonstrated on the behavior of the heat capacity .",
    "the canonical heat capacity is given by the familiar formula @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a thermal average of energy at an inverse temperature @xmath5 and @xmath6 stands for the canonical partition function .",
    "note that we assume a system with a discrete energy spectrum @xmath7 described by the level density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dirac function .",
    "since the @xmath2 limit of finite-@xmath1 systems coincides with the semiclassical limit @xcite , the level density of an infinite system can be represented by the semiclassical expression @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 stands for the classical hamiltonian of the system as a function of coordinates @xmath13 and momenta @xmath14 . also the semiclassical partition function is given by a phase ",
    "space integral @xmath15 and the heat capacity reads as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes dispersion of energy in the classical thermal ensemble at inverse temperature @xmath18 . for a general quantity @xmath19 , the thermal dispersion @xmath20 is determined by means of a @xmath21-dimensional integration over the whole phase space : @xmath22    for a hamiltonian of the familiar form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the quadratic kinetic energy and @xmath25 a potential energy , the canonical heat capacity reduces to @xmath26 here the first term results from the evaluation of the momentum ",
    "space integrals involved in @xmath27 , while the second term is proportional to a thermal dispersion of the potential energy @xmath28 , which is obtained solely by integration over the configuration space using @xmath29    on the other hand , the microcanonical determination of the heat capacity makes use of the microcanonical inverse temperature @xmath30 for a fixed value @xmath31 , this equation represents a condition for a vanishing derivative of the canonical thermal energy distribution @xmath32 at the given canonical inverse temperature @xmath18 . if this distribution has a single maximum , as expected in a typical situation , eq .",
    "determines its energy , which we denote @xmath33 . the microcanonical heat capacity is then defined as @xmath34 it is analogous to eq . , but with the average thermal energy @xmath4 replaced by the most probable energy @xmath33 .",
    "note that the equations @xmath35 ( equivalent to @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 are referred to as microcanonical and canonical caloric equations , respectively , while their solution in the plane @xmath38 are called microcanonical and canonical caloric curves .",
    "it is clear that the the microcanonical and canonical heat capacities are directly derived from the slopes of the respective caloric curves . in standard thermodynamics , where one expects a convergence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for large @xmath0 ,",
    "both canonical and microcanonical heat capacities become identical in the thermodynamic limit . however , in the @xmath2 limit of low-@xmath1 systems the reality can be different . in particular , eq .",
    "can yield a multiple solution in energy , or in contrary no solution within a certain domain of @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates more complex forms of the thermal energy distribution .",
    "in such a situation , the microcanonical heat capacity is not well defined , e.g. , has several branches corresponding to the multiple extremes of @xmath41 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to calculate both canonical and microcanonical heat capacities for power - law hamiltonians . in this case",
    ", the microcanonical heat capacity has no ambiguity but differs from the canonical result .",
    "consider either separable or rotationally symmetric hamiltonian forms ,    [ hpow ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are positive coefficients and @xmath45 and @xmath46 arbitrary ( not necessarily integer ) positive powers .",
    "the semiclassical partition function and level density in both cases can be evaluated analytically , yielding power - law dependences @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where the power constants @xmath49 for both hamiltonian forms and are given by    [ mpow ] @xmath50    the canonical and microcanonical heat capacities for the respective cases read as    [ cpow ]",

    "this condition is not satisfied in @xmath55 systems with quadratic or steeper potentials , @xmath56 ( for instance , quartic and hard - wall 1-dimensional potentials yield decreasing level densities @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the canonical results are conceivable for any @xmath59 .    as seen from eq . , the canonical and microcanonical heat capacities for power - law hamiltonians satisfy a relation @xmath60",
    "the reason is that the thermal energy distribution with @xmath48 has the average energy @xmath4 systematically larger than the most probable energy @xmath33 , and this asymmetry increases linearly with temperature . for low  numbers ( small values of @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the difference is significant .",
    "however , as the  number increases , both canonical and microcanonical specific heats calculated per a single  become indistinguishable , reaching equality @xmath61 in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "the  represents an @xmath63 singularity in the level density of a finite-@xmath1 quantum system caused by a stationary point of the corresponding classical hamiltonian .",
    "the singularity affects also many other observables , e.g. , the of energy levels with a running control parameter , the form of eigenstates and evolution of some expectation values in the critical energy region , response of the system to external probes and so on @xcite . here",
    "we will investigate some consequences on thermal behavior .",
    "a classification of the generic  for system with an arbitrary  number @xmath1 was derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a non - degenerate stationary point ( ) with rank @xmath64 of the hamiltonian function @xmath11 in the @xmath21-dimensional phase space ( that is , a locally quadratic stationary point with @xmath64 negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath65 ) causes a singularity in the @xmath66th derivative of the level density .",
    "the singularity has a form @xmath67 where @xmath68 stands for a step function , @xmath69 or 0 for @xmath70 or @xmath71 , respectively , and @xmath72 denotes the critical energy at which the  occurs .",
    "we observe that at the energy of an , the derivative @xmath73 shows either a jump ( if the index @xmath64 is even ) or a logarithmic divergence ( if @xmath64 is odd ) . for degenerate ( flatter than quadratic ) stationary points",
    ", the character of the non - analyticity of @xmath74 can be different ( possibly affecting lower derivatives ) , but these cases are rare ( we will see an example below ) .",
    "the  singularities have a direct impact on the microcanonical thermodynamics of the system , and indirectly modify also the canonical thermodynamics .",
    "determination of the microcanonical quantities relies on uniqueness of the solution of the microcanonical caloric equation , that is on the monotonicity of the microcanonical ( inverse ) temperature as a function of energy .",
    "this is commonly violated in particular for low  numbers . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the presence of any  implies a discontinuous or divergent behavior of the level density , so the microcanonical caloric curve can not even be defined . for @xmath75 ,",
    "an -related  leads to a jump or logarithmic divergence of @xmath76 , so the microcanonical caloric equation has multiple or no solutions in wide temperature domains .",
    "this was discussed in ref.@xcite , so in the following we focus on the @xmath77 cases .",
    "a unique solution of the microcanonical caloric equation can fail even for @xmath78 . considering the -related singularities ,",
    "this is so near an  with @xmath79 ( the microcanonical caloric curve in @xmath80 has an upward vertical tangent at the critical point ) , and it may be so near an  with @xmath81 ( here the tangent makes an upward jump ) .",
    "both these singularities can give rise to a pair of adjacent local extremes of the microcanonical caloric curve . as a consequence , @xmath82 in certain intervals of @xmath18 has three branches ( two positive and one negative ) and may exhibit some divergences ( located at the edges of the intervals ) .",
    "an example will be discussed in sec.[sec : esqptcnum ] .    for @xmath83 , the -related  do not any more create any upward pointing segments of the microcanonical caloric curve ,",
    "so the solution of the caloric equation is unique .",
    "nevertheless , either form of non - analyticity in the level density causes an associated singularity in the corresponding derivative of the microcanonical heat capacity . indeed , using eq .",
    ", one can express the @xmath84th derivative of @xmath82 in @xmath18 through the derivatives of @xmath74 in @xmath85 : @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) . here",
    "we explicitly write only the term that contains the highest derivative of @xmath74 , while @xmath88 collects all the remaining terms , which contain only derivatives @xmath89 of lower orders @xmath90 . assuming a discontinuity ( divergence ) in the @xmath66th derivative of @xmath74 , as follows from eq . for any -related",
    ", we expect the same type of non - analyticity affecting the @xmath91th derivative of the microcanonical heat capacity @xmath82 .",
    "examples of this behavior will be shown in sec.[sec : esqptcnum ] .",
    "let us turn now to the canonical heat capacity @xmath92 . as follows from eqs . and",
    ", it must be a smooth , regular function of temperature , irrespective of the presence of  and an actual size of the  number .",
    "however , for systems that have complicated energy landscapes in the phase space ( with minima , maxima and saddles , hence ) the canonical heat capacity typically exhibits a non - trivial dependence on temperature .",
    "the location of increasing and decreasing segments of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath18 is determined by an interplay of dispersion and asymmetry ( skewness ) of the thermal energy distribution . indeed , defining the third moment of a quantity @xmath19 in the thermal ensemble , @xmath93 one can write a simple expression for the first derivative of the canonical heat capacity @xmath94 the asymmetry can in general be both positive or negative ( more weight of the distribution above or below the average @xmath95 , respectively ) , but only the case @xmath96 may give rise to a non - monotonous temperature dependence of @xmath92 . every time when @xmath97 crosses @xmath98 , the canonical heat capacity has a maximum , minimum or inflection .",
    "the number and positions of these points depend sensitively on the specific shape of the hamiltonian function @xmath11 .        to illustrate these matters on a toy example , let us consider a hamiltonian of the form with a separable potential @xmath99 .",
    "the first component @xmath100 is a multi - plateau infinite - square - well potential , @xmath101 where all intervals @xmath102 with @xmath103 are disjunct and have lengths @xmath104 .",
    "the remaining components @xmath105 are harmonic - oscillator potentials .",
    "it should be stressed that thermodynamic results discussed below are independent of whether the intervals in eq .",
    "are connected or not , so it does not make any difference whether the potential @xmath106 is a single infinite well with several bottom plateaus or a system of independent wells ( or a combination of both ) .",

    "note that instead of non - degenerate stationary points we now deal with an infinitely degenerate case , since inside the well(s ) the derivatives with respect to @xmath108 vanish up to infinite order .",
    "nevertheless , the results will be analogous to those obtained for the  cases .",
    "the level density of the @xmath66-dimensional oscillator is given by @xmath109 , while that of the 1-dimensional potential well system reads as @xmath110 ( we are using the semiclassical approximation ) .",
    "the total level density of the whole system is given by a convolution of the two partial level densities with @xmath111 @xcite , yielding : @xmath112 the @xmath66th derivative of this function diverges at the energies @xmath7 corresponding to individual potential plateaus , which therefore become critical points of  of a non-  type .",
    "this behavior is partly analogous to eq .",
    ", except that the divergence is not logarithmic but @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .    following the directions given above , one would be able to determine the microcanonical heat capacity @xmath82 and to analyze the singularities in its @xmath91th derivative connected with the critical points @xmath7 .",
    "it is also very easy to calculate the canonical quantities .",
    "thanks to separability of the system , the partition function factorizes and the canonical heat capacity @xmath92 becomes a sum of terms corresponding to individual degrees of freedom .",
    "the oscillators contribute by an overall constant @xmath66 and the kinetic term of the first  by an additional step - up by 1/2 .",
    "the only non - trivial contribution results from the second term of eq . ,",
    "but it can also be calculated analytically .",
    "note that if all plateau energies are the same , @xmath115 , the contribution of the potential component @xmath106 is identically zero ( the semiclassical thermal energy distribution for any temperature is fully localized at the bottom energy @xmath116 , where the @xmath55 level density diverges ) . the situation becomes more interesting if the plateau energies are diversified .",
    "some examples of heat capacities for such potentials are shown in fig.[f_wellheat ] .    in the upper panel of fig.[f_wellheat ]",
    "we present the potential component @xmath117 of the canonical heat capacity as a function of temperature @xmath118 for the potential with 3 plateaus .",

    "the dependence is non - monotonous and has 1 or 2 local maxima . in the lower panel of fig.[f_wellheat ]",
    "we present the potential component of @xmath92 for a well with 5 plateaus , and in that case one can observe a sequence of up to 4 local maxima . the peaks in this sequence correspond to the temperature domains in which the population rate of individual plateaus with successive energies is maximized .",
    "if two or more plateau energies get closer to each other ( i.e. , of the same magnitude , their ratio still being as large as @xmath121 ) , the peaks in the heat capacity merge , reducing complexity of the dependence . for @xmath122 ,",

    "if not specified otherwise , we choose @xmath141 for quartic potentials and @xmath142 for quadratic potentials .",
    "note that the coefficients are chosen independently for each , so we allow for situations in which only one of the potentials @xmath143 has the double - well form while the others are harmonic oscillators , as well as those in which each @xmath143 contains a non - trivial quartic dependence .",
    "the first type of situation is investigated in fig.[f_cusosc ] .",

    "the limiting values , namely @xmath149 for @xmath18 small and @xmath150 for @xmath18 large , follow from a prevailingly quadratic behavior of the potential at low energies near the minimum ( at low temperatures ) and a mixed [ @xmath151quadratic , @xmath152quartic ] dependence at large energies ( large temperatures ) .",
    "also the microcanonical curve @xmath153 has a peak - like behavior , but it moreover exhibits 3 points of non - analyticity .",
    "they result from the level - density singularities caused by the stationary points and , as expected , are most apparent for low  numbers . for @xmath78 ,",

    "non - monotonous dependences of @xmath92 in fig.[f_cusosc ] are similar to those from fig.[f_wellheat ] .",
    "the reason for this behavior is a gradual population of states located in individual potential wells and of the higher - energy states centered in the barrier region . as in the multi - plateau case ,",
