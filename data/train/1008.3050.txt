    "for @xmath94 the equilibrium hd region ( iii ) almost disappeared , however the equilibrium kw region ( iv ) is still well pronounced being much less sensitive to the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the bottleneck effect in classical hydrodynamic turbulence is understood traditionally  @xcite as a hump on a plot of compensated energy spectrum @xmath95 in the crossover region between inertial and viscous intervals .",
    "this is very general phenomenon reported in many numerical simulations and experiments of classical hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "for example , yeung and zhou @xcite , gotoh et al @xcite , kaneda et al @xcite and dobler et al @xcite found the bottleneck effect in their numerical simulations .",

    "shen and warhaft @xcite , pak et al @xcite , she and jackson@xcite and other experimental groups also observed the bottleneck effect in fluid turbulence . the bottleneck effect has been seen in other forms of turbulence as well , see e.g. refs .",
    "[ 10 - 15 ] in ref .",
    "[ ] .        to characterize the value of this effect one can introduce a  bottleneck magnitude \" @xmath96 : the hump height , normalized by the plateau value of @xmath95 in the inertial interval",

    "[ f:4 ] , left , its magnitude @xmath97 for 512@xmath4 dns and decreases with the resolution increase : @xmath98 for @xmath63 and @xmath99 for @xmath0 .",
    "recent results  @xcite based on the @xmath100 dns confirm the statement that the bottleneck magnitude in classical turbulence systematically decreases with the dns resolution increase ( or equivalently , with the taylor - reynolds number re@xmath101 growth , and @xmath102 as re@xmath103 ) . coming to comparison of the bottleneck effects in our modeling and numerical simulations",
    "we should notice that the lnr model accounts only for leading in @xmath104 terms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is based on the differential approximation for the energy flux , which is reasonable for vivid power - like behavior of the energy spectra , which exists only for @xmath27 , fig .",
    "therefore , one expects that the lnr model is suitable for quantitative analysis of experiments in @xmath4he and @xmath5he , where @xmath105 , and can only qualitatively describe the simulations presented here with @xmath106 .",

    "the resolution of the current simulations does not allow to resolve the kw - scaling  ( [ ln ] ) with constant energy flux as it was done in  @xcite , but the bottleneck is definitely there .    to measure bottleneck magnitudes in quantum turbulence we re - plotted our data of fig",

    "[ f:4 ] , right .",
    "one sees large humps with magnitudes @xmath96 that increases with the resolution , reaching @xmath108 for @xmath0 . recall that in the classical turbulence @xmath96 is much ( in about 20 times ! ) smaller and demonstrates opposite tendency with the resolution .",
    "we concluded that classical and quantum bottlenecks have completely different nature .",
    "small magnitude of the bottleneck in classical turbulence is related to some nonlocality of the energy transfer toward small scales that is slightly suppressed due to fast decrease of the turbulence energy in the dissipation range , while in quantum turbulence ( at zero temperature ) the essential bottleneck effect originates from the strong suppression of the energy flux in the kelvin wave region .    indeed , fig .",
    "[ f:4 ] , right , demonstrates a good agreement between the qt dns data and the lnr model prediction ( that accounts for the flux suppression mentioned above ) for @xmath106 , which improves with increasing the dns resolution .",
    "the cutoff of the spectra for large @xmath3 is a consequence of limited @xmath3-space in the simulations .",
    "one predicts that with the further increase of the resolution the bottleneck magnitude can reach @xmath109 at @xmath106 and even much larger values for larger @xmath78 .      in the paper",
    "we conclude that the observed essential bottleneck energy accumulation has definitely quantum nature ( quantization of circulation ) and can be completely rationalized within the lnr model of gradual eddy - wave crossover , suggested in ref .",
    "we consider this model as a minimal model of quantum turbulence that describes homogeneous isotropic turbulence in superfluids with energy pumped at scales much larger than the mean intervortex distance , and reveals reasonable ( and even unexpectedly good ) agreement with the simulations of gross - pitaevskii equation discussed here .",
    "the reason is that in the most questionable crossover region , the lnr model predicts a local thermodynamic equilibrium , where the energy spectra are universal and non - sensitive to the details of microscopic mechanisms of interactions , e.g. vortex - reconnections , etc .",
