    "in astrophysics it is of high importance to construct a realistic physical model of stellar compact objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs ( wds ) which fits with observations .",
    "consequently , all physical phenomena and quantities must be duly taken into account in the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "up to now there exist three eos to describe the degenerate matter of wds : the chandrasekhar eos,@xcite the salpeter eos@xcite and the relativistic feynman - metropolis - teller ( rfmt ) eos.@xcite the main differences , advantages and drawbacks among theses eos are discussed by rotondo et al@xcite . in detail .",
    "moreover , according to shapiro et al.@xcite it is necessary to investigate wds in general relativity ( gr ) in order to analyze their stability though the corrections of gr can be neglected for low mass wds .    in this work",
    ", we investigate hot white dwarfs by employing the chandrasekhar eos@xcite including the finite - temperature effects .",
    "similar approach to include the effects of finite temperatures in case of the rfmt eos has been used by s.  m. de carvalho et al.@xcite    here we perform similar analyses following s.  m. de carvalho et al.@xcite in order to construct the mass - radius relations of white dwarfs at finite temperatures in gr for the sake of completeness .",
    "we compare our results with the estimated masses and radii from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss - e06 catalog).@xcite",
    "for the sake of clarity we make use of the chandrasekhar eos since it is the simplest eos for wd matter , is well known and widely used in the description of physical properties of wds.@xcite      in general , the eos is determined through the total pressure and the total energy density of matter . within the chandrasekhar s approximation ,",
    "the total pressure is due to the pressure of electrons @xmath1 since the pressure of positive ions @xmath2 ( naked nuclei ) is insignificant whereas the energy density is due to the energy density of nuclei @xmath3 as the energy density of the degenerate electrons @xmath4 is negligibly small .",
    "thus , the chandrasekhar eos is given by    @xmath5    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the average atomic weight , @xmath8 is the number of protons , @xmath9 g is the unified atomic mass , @xmath10 is the speed of light and @xmath11 is the electron number density . in general",

    "when @xmath27 one can write for the number density of the degenerate electron gas the following expression from the eq .",

    "the first two factors in square brackets represent special relativistic corrections of order @xmath38 that arise from the mass - energy relation so that the denominators , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , vary relativistically in connection with einstein s famous equation @xmath41 .",
    "the last term in brackets is a general relativistic correction due to non - negligible strength of the gravitational potential ( in units of @xmath42 ) and the meaning of @xmath43 as the total integrated mass out to a radial distance @xmath33 .",
