    "in every adsorbate system , energy and momentum is transferred between adsorbate and substrate continuously , even when in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the substrate can provide the energy required for an adsorbate to explore the potential energy landscape , and can equally absorb the adsorbate s energy , resulting in damping of adsorbate motion .",

    "pyrrole , unlike cp , has one atom that is different from the others . by varying the coupling strengths for the n atom in the idof - md simulations of pyrrole",
    ", we have investigated the effects of this asymmetry on the friction .",
    "the friction is at a maximum if the n and c have the same coupling strength to the substrate .",
    "as all contributions to the friction are mediated through the coupling between the individual atoms and the substrate , @xcite a reduction in friction with weaker coupling is to be expected .",
    "however , an increase of a factor of two in the coupling strength of the n atoms also reduces the friction by a third ; as rotation , which is the main channel of dissipation , is partially blocked . because of the ( approximate ) five - fold symmetry of the molecule and triangular symmetry of the lattice , a fully symmetric molecule feels only a small energy barrier against rotation around the @xmath65-axis .",
    "when the n atom couples more strongly the barrier increases and rotation becomes more difficult .    in comparison , further asymmetry is added in the thiophene / cu(111 ) system by the fact that the molecule bonds to the substrate covalently through the sulfur atom with the ring tilting away from horizontal . by comparing the friction obtained for the full system in model ( i ) with cases where",
    "different modes are turned off in the idof - md simulations , we can deconstruct the contributions of the different modes . in case ( iii )",
    "only the internal vibrations are switched off , while in case ( ii ) the frustrated rotation modes are missing as well . from the friction values given in table  [ table : exptvstheory ]",
    ", we find that frustrated rotations give an important contribution to the friction in an adsorbate that is not flat - lying .",
    "we further note that in the case of thiophene the internal vibrational degrees of freedom decrease the friction somewhat , going from model ( ii ) to ( i ) .",
    "the mechanisms causing this small decrease are complex and most likely due to a change in the coupling between the different modes .",
    "overall , it must be concluded that several modes contribute significantly , and in either sense , to the frictional forces experienced by thiophene .",
    "the present work demonstrates that md simulations taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of a molecular adsorbate species can be a valuable tool for the analysis of hese experiments .",
    "in addition to the investigation of friction coefficients and center - of - mass adsorbate trajectories described in the present work , it is possible to deduce isfs from idof - md simulations for a more direct comparison with hese data , as is routinely done for com - md simulations.@xcite in general , the number of free parameters in idof - md simulations is likely too high to allow a reliable analysis of new hese measurements . once additional information about the potential energy landscape has been obtained ( e.g. by com - md or dft calculations ) , however , we believe idof - md simulations can be a valuable tool to test a pes or to investigate the different contributions to the friction in more detail .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the importance of internal degrees of freedom in the friction of molecular adsorbates . by comparing four systems that span",
    "a range of different adsorption geometries , bond strengths and energy landscape corrugations , we have demonstrated that the influence of these three parameters is relatively unimportant in the friction for these systems , while the increase in friction compared to atomic adsorbate systems is large .",
    "idof - md simulations show that the main contribution to the increase in friction of the molecular systems can be attributed to frustrated rotation around axes parallel to the surface plane and activated rotation around the @xmath65-axis .",
