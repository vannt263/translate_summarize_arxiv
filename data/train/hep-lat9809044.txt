    "the semi - leptonic @xmath7 decay is phenomenologically interesting since its feynman amplitude involves the poorly know ckm matrix element @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where the hadronic tensor @xmath11 , and its lorentz decompostion into form factors is calculable using lattice qcd .",
    "we perform the matching of the lattice to continuum @xmath12 currents to 1 loop using the on - shell scheme in feynman gauge with vanishing external spatial momenta . in the on - shell scheme the wavefunction renormalisation and vertex corrections individually contain ( cancelling ) infra - red divergences which we control using a fictitious gluon mass , @xmath13 .",
    "we use dimensional regularisation to control the ultra - violet behaviour in the continuum calculation .",
    "expanding the 1-loop correction to the currents to @xmath14 , and writing @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16            - 2   + o(\\frac{1}{m^2})\\ ] ]    @xmath17\\\\ &           + & \\frac{p_k}{m_b } \\left[\\frac{2}{\\epsilon-1 } - \\frac{2 \\epsilon \\log\\epsilon}{(\\epsilon-1)^2}\\right ] \\\\ &           + & \\frac{p^\\prime_k}{m_c } \\left[\\frac{2 \\epsilon}{\\epsilon-1 } + \\frac{2 \\epsilon \\log\\epsilon}{(\\epsilon-1)^2}\\right]+ o(\\frac{1}{m^2 } ) \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath18 + o(\\frac{1}{m^2})\\ ] ]    @xmath19\\\\ & + & \\gamma_5 \\left [ 6\\frac{\\epsilon+1}{\\epsilon-1}\\right ]   + o(\\frac{1}{m^2 } ) \\end{array}\\ ] ]    here the currents @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be renormalised to @xmath22 in the usual manner , however the currents @xmath23 and @xmath24 will involve operator mixing at this order .",
    "we use the @xmath4 lattice nrqcd action @xcite for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks , @xmath25 @xmath26    for which the feynman rules may be found in reference @xcite .    the foldy - wouthysen transformation of the continuum current corrections and dimensional arguments for which currents can contribute at @xmath4 suggest we take the bases of operators in table  [ tabcurrents ] for the lattice currents .    .lattice current bases [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we are nearing completion of the calculation of the mixed current for @xmath23 , while there is a smaller basis of operators for @xmath24 , so that the corresponding calculation should be somewhat easier .",
    "thereafter we shall perform a similar calculation for the @xmath27 transition using the nrqcd action for the @xmath5 quark , and the o(a ) improved wilson action for the @xmath6 quark .",
    "the extension of the calculation to @xmath28 would be of interest .",
