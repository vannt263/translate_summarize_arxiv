    "the space density of optically luminous quasars peaks at @xmath9 , and declines towards higher redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of quasars at high redshift provides useful constraints on cosmological models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the quasar population at high redshift , and its relation with the evolution of the star forming rate and the intergalactic ionizing background , are important input to our understanding of the formation and early evolution of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . meanwhile , the absorption spectra of luminous quasars at high redshift are extremely important in understanding the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since the discovery of the first quasar at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , more than 60 quasars at @xmath10 have been found ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "however , only 12 quasars at @xmath11 have been identified , of which only one ( pc1247 + 3406 , @xmath12 , @xcite ) has a redshift larger than  4.74 .",
    "indeed , @xcite shows that current data are consistent with only one @xmath13 qso per 50 deg@xmath2 for @xmath14 .",
    "most known high - redshift quasars have been selected as outliers in color space from the stellar locus using multicolor broadband photometry ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at @xmath13",
    ", the major emission lines and absorption features of quasars are redshifted into the red part of the optical band .",
    "searching for quasars at these redshifts poses three major technical requirements : a red - sensitive detector and filter system , large sky coverage ( because of their rarity ) , and fast , automated software to do accurate photometry on the resulting large data set .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) will use a dedicated 2.5 m telescope to obtain ccd images to @xmath15 in five broad optical bands ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , centered at 3540 , 4770 , 6230 , 7630  and 9130 , @xcite ) over 10,000 deg@xmath2 of the high galactic latitude sky centered approximately on the north galactic pole .",
    "the survey data processing software provides astrometric and photometric calibrations , and finds and measures properties of all detected objects in the data .",
    "spectra of the brightest @xmath21 galaxies and @xmath22 quasar candidates will be obtained on the same telescope .",
    "the sdss will select quasar candidates from the much more numerous stars by their distinctive colors , and will generate a large and uniformly - selected sample covering redshifts ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . because of the large sky coverage and the inclusion of the near - infrared @xmath20 band , the sdss is capable of identifying large numbers of quasars at @xmath13 ( fan 1999 ) .",
    "the sdss achieved first light in imaging mode in may 1998 . by the end of 1998",
    ", it had acquired several hundred deg@xmath2 of imaging data in its commissioning phase .",
    "using the arc 3.5 m telescope , we have obtained spectra of a number of high - redshift quasar candidates produced by these data . in this paper , we report the discovery of 15 high - redshift quasars at @xmath25 , including four quasars at @xmath26 , identified from @xmath1 deg@xmath2 of sdss imaging data , 1.4% of the total survey area of the sdss . in  2 ,",
    "we discuss the photometric observations and data reduction . in  3 , we discuss the color selection of high - redshift quasar candidates .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of these objects are presented in  4 . in  5 , we discuss the spectral properties of the quasars .",
    "we briefly discuss the success rate and the quasar number counts we find from these data , and compare the number counts with predictions based on previous results on quasar evolution in  6 .",
    "the sdss telescope is a dedicated 2.5 m altitude - azimuth instrument at apache point , new mexico , with a wide , essentially distortion - free field .",
    "it has a modified @xmath27 ritchey - chretien optical design with a large secondary and two corrector lenses below the primary mirror ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopy and imaging require separate second correctors .",
    "the imaging corrector forms the base structural element for the imaging camera .",
    "the imaging camera ( @xcite ) consists of a mosaic of 30 imaging @xmath28 site ccds with 24@xmath29 m pixels subtending @xmath30 on the sky .",
    "the ccds are arranged in six dewars ( six columns ) containing 5 ccds each , mounted to the corrector and observing the sky through five broad - band filters .",
    "the five filters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) cover the entire optical band from the atmospheric cutoff in the blue to the silicon sensitivity cutoff in the red .",
    "the @xmath16 band , with the bulk of its response shortward of the balmer discontinuity , is especially important for the selection of low - redshift quasars , while the reddest band , @xmath20 , is critical for quasars at @xmath13 , where the ly@xmath8 emission line enters the @xmath19 band .",
    "the photometric data are taken in time - delay and integrate ( tdi , or `` drift - scan '' ) mode at sidereal rate ; a given point on the sky passes through each of the five filters in succession .",
    "the total integration time per filter is 54.1 seconds , and the expected survey depth ( 5 @xmath31 detection for point sources at @xmath32 seeing ) is 22.3 , 23.3 , 23.1 , 22.5 and 20.8 in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively ( but see below ) .",
    "the imaging ccds saturate at about @xmath33 , so to calibrate these data with existing astrometric catalogs , the camera contains an additional 22 ccds , each @xmath34 pixels , with neutral density filters that saturate only at @xmath35 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the data are read from the ccds , and onto disk and tape using a data acquisition system described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sdss photometric system is based on the ab@xmath36 system :    @xmath37    with the zeropoints defined by the spectrophotometric observations of the @xcite standard stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric calibration will be carried out with a separate @xmath38 photometric telescope equipped with a single - ccd camera and the sdss filters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric telescope will continually observe photometric standard stars to measure the photometric zeropoint and atmospheric extinction .",
    "however , the data used in this paper were taken before the photometric telescope was commissioned ; we thus calibrated the data by observing secondary standards in the survey area ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) using a ( now decommissioned ) @xmath39 telescope at apache point and the us naval observatory s @xmath40 telescope .",
    "moreover , the sdss primary standard star network had not been completely established when these data were taken . therefore , the absolute photometric calibration is only accurate to 510% ( although the relative photometry is considerably better ) .",
    "thus in this paper , we will denote the preliminary sdss magnitudes we have measured as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , rather than the notation @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 that will be used for the final sdss photometric system ( and is used in this paper to refer to the sdss filters themselves ) .",
    "the sdss data used in this paper were acquired with the telescope parked on the meridian , at the celestial equator .",
    "most of the quasar candidates are from data taken in 19 sept 1998 ( sdss run 94 ) .",
    "this observation covers the northern strip of the equatorial scan ( two interleaved scan _ strips _ are needed to fill in the gaps between different columns of ccds and form a filled _ stripe _ 2.5 degrees wide , see @xcite ) .",
    "the scan is 6 hours long along the celestial equator .",
    "the raw data total roughly 120 gbyte .",
    "the scan covers the ra range of @xmath43 , with a total area of @xmath44 deg@xmath2 at high galactic latitude ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the night was photometric , with seeing varying from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "because of low - level astigmatism in the 2.5 m telescope optics during the early commissioning period , the width of the point spread function ( psf ) is also a function of the position of the star on the focal plane .",
    "this is an important term in the error budget of the psf photometry .",
    "in addition , one quasar candidate was taken from data obtained on 21 sept 1998 ( sdss run 109 ) , which covered the southern strip of the equatorial scan from ra = 2@xmath48 to 4@xmath48 , with a total area of @xmath49 deg@xmath2 .",
    "the seeing in this scan varied from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "these data are processed by a series of automated pipelines to carry out astrometric and photometric measurements .",
    "the astrometric pipeline ( @xcite ) calibrates the positions of stars with reference to the astrometric standards , and establishes an astrometric solution for each of the imaging ccds , giving accurate relative astrometry between colors .",
    "these data are analyzed with a pipeline ( @xcite ) that measures the magnitudes of secondary standard stars , and sets the photometric zeropoint of the imaging camera , while producing a measure of extinction on each night .",
    "the photometric pipeline ( photo , @xcite ) reduces the data from the imaging camera and produces corrected images and object catalogs .",
    "photo carries out the following tasks :    1 .   determines smoothly varying flat fields , bias vectors , sky values , and psfs along each scan line ; 2 .",
    "flat fields the data , interpolates over bad columns , and removes cosmic rays ; 3",
    ".   finds objects in each color as statistically significant peaks after smoothing with the psf ; 4 .   combines the data from five bands for each object ; 5 .",
    "deblends overlapped objects as described below ; 6 .",
    "measures the position , counts , size and shape of each detected object , and 7 .",
    "classifies objects as being extended or consistent with point sources , based on fitting simple models .",
    "the final step is to write out calibrated object catalogs using information passed from astrometric and photometric calibrations .",
    "flags indicating image processing problems ( such as the presence of saturated pixels , problems with the deblender , and the fact that a cosmic ray has been removed ) , are also recorded in the output catalogs .",
    "photo measures the psf magnitude of each source by fitting a psf model of a double gaussian .",
    "we will use this psf magnitude throughout the paper . for objects that are undetected in a given band",
    ", the psf fit is constrained to the canonical center of the object in that color , after offsetting according to the astrometric solution .",
    "this allows an unbiased measure of the flux of a source even in the case when it is too faint to center up on it .",
    "even though such a measurement is quite noisy , it is very important in distinguishing between red stars and high - redshift quasars (  4 ) .",
    "overlapping objects are deblended into their constituent parts (  children \" ) consistently in all five bands .",
    "peaks are found in the image of a given object in each of the five bands , and the union of all the peaks is used to define the children into which the object will be deblended .",
    "for each pixel , the deblender assigns weights to each child based on the ansatz that astronomical objects possess a center of symmetry .",
    "however , the final deblended children have no such requirement on their symmetry .",
    "the output of the deblender is an image of each child in each filter , which are then passed to the object measuring code .",
    "details of the algorithm are given by @xcite .",
    "the final object catalog of run 94 includes a total of about 2 million objects .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are roughly 22.3 , 22.6 , 22.7 , 22.4 and 20.5 in @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath42 , respectively , as determined from the cutoff in the observed number - magnitude relation .",
    "this is somewhat brighter than the survey design due to the poor image quality of this run , and the poor reflectivity of the primary mirror ( which has since been realuminized ) . as mentioned above , the absolute photometric calibration is accurate to @xmath56 mag , while the relative photometric errors are better than 0.05 mag at @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the error in the absolute photometric calibration has little effect on the separation of quasars and stars in color space , as it shifts the colors and magnitudes of all objects uniformly .",
    "figure 1 presents the color - color diagrams of one column ( one - sixth of the total ) of the run 94 data for stellar sources at @xmath6 .",
    "a source is plotted in each panel only if it is detected in all three of the relevant bands .",
    "objects flagged as saturated in any band , lying on the bleed trail of a saturated star , or overlapping the edge of the image boundary have been rejected . however , deblended objects are included in this diagram ; their distribution is no broader than that of isolated objects .",
    "the group of sources at @xmath62 and @xmath63 are mostly compact galaxies at @xmath64 ( i.e. , they appear not to be point - like on the images ) ; the star - galaxy classifier was not fine - tuned at faint magnitudes when these data were processed . note the narrowness of the distributions of all the diagrams .",
    "we also plot the median tracks of quasar colors as a function of redshift from the simulation of fan ( 1999 ) , and indicate the approximate locations of low - redshift ( @xmath65 ) quasars , hot white dwarfs ( wd ) and a stars from fan ( 1999 ) .",
    "quasars are well - separated from the stellar locus at most redshifts in the sdss photometric system , and can be selected by their distinct colors . at @xmath66 ,",
    "quasar optical colors are dominated by the power - law continuum , and the @xmath67 color of quasars remains smaller than 0.5 , considerably bluer than normal stars seen at high latitudes .",
    "ly @xmath8 emission enters the @xmath16 band at @xmath68 , making the @xmath67 color even bluer .",
    "when ly @xmath8 emission moves from @xmath16 to @xmath17 at @xmath69 , the @xmath67 color gets redder . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the absorption systems , first the ly @xmath8 forest , then the lyman limit systems ( llss ) , enter the @xmath16 band .",
    "they absorb a substantial fraction of the continuum radiation in @xmath16 band , and the @xmath67 color reddens quickly with redshift . at @xmath71 , quasars have very similar colors to a stars in the sdss system .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "most quasars are undetectable in @xmath16 due to the presence of llss , which are optically thick to the continuum radiation from the quasar .",
    "meanwhile , the absorption systems begin to dominate in the @xmath17 band , and ly@xmath8 emission moves to the @xmath18 band .",
    "the @xmath72 color becomes increasingly red towards higher redshift , while the @xmath73 color remains relatively small .",
    "quasars at @xmath25 are well - separated from the stellar locus in the @xmath72 vs. @xmath73 diagram . at @xmath74 , quasars are well - separated from the stellar locus in the @xmath73 vs. @xmath75 diagram as the absorption features move into the @xmath18 band .",
    "the first quasar at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , as well as the highest redshift quasar previously known ( @xcite ) , were discovered using similar methods .",
    "recently , a similar technique has been used to search for high - redshift galaxies , resulting in the discovery of large scale clustering of lyman break galaxies at @xmath76 ( @xcite ) and the first discoveries of galaxies at @xmath24 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the sdss spectroscopic quasar survey",
    ", quasar candidates will be selected by the target selection pipeline ( cf . newberg & yanny 1997 ) . at the time of writing",
    ", this pipeline has not been fine - tuned .",
    "furthermore , the sdss multi - fiber spectrograph has not yet been commissioned .",
    "we therefore have carried out spectroscopic observations of only a small number of objects .",
    "we have applied simple color cuts to select only quasars with colors consistent with having @xmath0 .",
    "we carry out two separate cuts :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath77 candidates : quasar candidates with colors consistent with @xmath78 , selected principally from their position on the @xmath72 vs. @xmath73 diagram . the full selection criteria are :    @xmath79    the region satisfied by criteria ( @xmath80 ) and ( @xmath81 ) is plotted as the shaded area in figure 1(b ) . criterion ( @xmath82 ) selects objects for which most of the flux in @xmath16 is absorbed at @xmath25 .",
    "criterion ( @xmath83 ) provides the additional constraint that the continuum be relatively flat in the red part of the spectrum : this is typical for quasars with power law continua ; red stars and compact red galaxies tend to have a much redder @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath84 candidates : quasar candidates with colors consistent with @xmath85 , selected principally from their position on the @xmath73 vs. @xmath75 diagram .",
    "the full selection criteria are :    @xmath86    quasars at @xmath74 have most of the flux absorbed in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands ; such objects are selected with criteria ( @xmath82 ) and ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "criteria ( @xmath80 ) and ( @xmath81 ) are illustrated in figure 1(c ) as the shaded region .",
    "needless to say , most of the @xmath84 candidates are undetected in @xmath87 , and therefore do not show up in figure 1(b ) .",
    "we visually inspected the image data in all five filters for all the candidates , paying special attention to those that were deblended from overlapping objects .",
    "we deleted from the candidate list obvious problematic cases , such as objects that are close to a saturated star or big galaxy .",
    "the final candidate list includes 35 candidates ; 25 are @xmath77 candidates at @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are @xmath84 candidates at @xmath90 .",
    "eight candidates are deblended from nearby neighbors .",
    "two of the candidates , sdssp j015339.61@xmath91001104.9 and sdssp j010619.25 + 004823.4 ( see table 1 ; for naming convention , see  4 ) , are the previously known quasars bri01510025",
    "( @xmath92 ) and bri0103 + 0032 ( @xmath93 ) , found in a multicolor survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two objects are the only quasars with @xmath25 in the area covered by run 94 found in the ned database .",
    "we matched the candidate list against the first ( @xcite ) radio continuum catalog ( which covers this area of sky ) ; only one of them has a radio counterpart at 20 cm at the 1mjy level , namely sdssp j015339.61@xmath91001104.9 , which is an unresolved source of 4.75 mjy .",
    "we have similarly cross - correlated the list against the rosat full - sky pixel images ; none of these objects were detected , implying a typical upper limit of @xmath94 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ( w. voges , private communication ) .",
    "spectra of 24 high - redshift quasar candidates from run 94 , and one from run 109 , were obtained with the arc 3.5 m telescope in the apache point observatory , using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) during a number of nights in november and december of 1998 .",
    "one of the 24 objects observed ( sdssp j025518.58 + 004847.6 ) does not satisfy the color selection criteria ( eq .  2 ) with improved photometric calibration , and although we do present its spectrum below , we do not include it in the statistical analysis in  6 .",
    "the dis is a double spectrograph with a transition wavelength of 5350 between the blue and red side .",
    "the observations were taken with the low resolution gratings , with a dispersion of 6.2   pixel@xmath95 in the blue side and 7.1   pixel@xmath95 in the red side , and a resolution of roughly 2 pixels .",
    "the central wavelengths are 4400 and 7700   for the blue and red sides , respectively .",
    "the final spectrum covers the wavelength range of 4000   to 10,000  .",
    "the wavelength scale is calibrated with a cubic polynomial fit to lines from an ar - he - ne lamp ; the typical rms error of the fits is smaller than 0.5  .",
    "observations of the f subdwarf standards bd+17@xmath96 4708 and hd 19445 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) provided flux calibration and allowed removal of the atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "however , most of the candidates were not observed under photometric conditions , nor were they observed with the slit oriented perpendicular to the horizon .",
    "exposure times ranged from 1200 seconds for an 18 mag candidate to 7200 seconds for the faintest candidates ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using both standard software from the iraf package ( by xf ) , and the procedures described in schneider , schmidt , & gunn ( 1991a ) ( by dps ) .",
    "we place the data on an absolute flux scale ( to compensate for the losses due to non - photometric conditions ) by forcing the synthetic @xmath55 magnitudes from the spectra to be the same as the photometric measurements .",
    "the two independent reductions produce consistent results .",
    "fifteen of the 25 candidates display the characteristics of previously known high - redshift quasars : broad , strong emission lines , and absorption due to the ly@xmath8 forest and lyman limit systems .",
    "the redshifts range from 3.66 to 5.00 ; four of the @xmath84 candidates are quasars at redshifts 5.00 , 4.90 , 4.75 and 4.63 .",

    "they are interesting objects in their own right , and will be discussed in a separate paper ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in summary , we have obtained spectra or identifications of 17 of the 25 @xmath77 candidates from run 94 . among them , 2 are previously known quasars , 10 are new sdss quasars , and 5 are unidentified with spectra consistent with those of compact galaxies .",

    "in particular , the ly@xmath8+nv blend is fitted to two gaussians in all but one case .",

    "the properties of the four quasars at @xmath74 show no obvious difference from those at lower redshifts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the emission line redshift ( table 3 ) is calculated by taking the weighted mean of the redshift from oi+siii , siiv+oiv ] and civ lines , when they are detected ; ly@xmath8 is not used because of the strong absorption on its blue side . for all but two cases ,",
    "at least two of the three lines are detected .",
    "two quasars ( sdssp j021102.72@xmath91000910.3 and sdssp j230952.29@xmath91003138.9 ) have only civ detected , and we use its redshift here .",
    "the uncertainty in redshift determination is dominated by discrepancies of the redshifts of different lines .",
    "the statistical error from a single line measurement is typically much smaller .",
    "the redshift uncertainty quoted in table 3 is the scatter of the measurements from different lines .",
    "if the scatter is smaller than 0.01 ( or in the cases when only civ is detected ) , we adopt a lower limit of 0.01 .",
    "table 3 also gives ab@xmath112 , the ab magnitude of the quasar continuum at 1450  ( rest frame ) and @xmath113 of each quasar .",

    "we use a cosmology of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and a power law index of 0.5 for the quasar continuum when calculating @xmath113 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are comparable to that of 3c@xmath7273 , which is @xmath116 in this cosmology .    although the quality of our spectra is not high , precluding an accurate measurement of the flux decrement due to the ly@xmath8 forest , more than 70% of the continuum radiation blueward of ly@xmath8 emission line is absorbed by the forest for our highest - redshift quasars .",
    "this is quite consistent with what has been seen with previously known quasars at similar redshifts .",
    "strong lyman limit systems ( llss ) are visible in all quasars that have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio in that part of the spectra . their corresponding redshifts are listed in table 3 .",
    "for the four quasars at @xmath74 , the spectra near the lyman limit are too noisy to decide where the absorption occurs .",

    "sdssp j023231.40 - 000010.7 * ( @xmath121 ) .",

    "sdssp j032608.12 - 003340.2 * ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the spectrum reveals two features that could be @xmath123 llss at @xmath124 and 4.00 . there is a large optical depth lls at @xmath125 .",
    "* sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 * ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "this is the quasar with the highest known redshift to date .",
    "the ly@xmath8 , siiv+oiv ] and civ lines are clearly detected , but an accurate redshift determination is not straightforward .",
    "the ly@xmath8 emission line yields a redshift of 5.08 , but its blue wing is strongly affected by absorption .",
    "the other two lines detected , siiv+oiv ] and civ , give a consistent redshift of 5.00 .",
    "however , the siiv+oiv ] line is quite weak , while the red side of the civ line is strongly affected by the strong atmospheric absorption at 9300 .",
    "the redshift determination is quite uncertain .",
    "we have adopted a redshift of 5.00@xmath97 0.04 for this object .",
    "the success rate of the quasar search from these sdss commissioning data is substantially higher than that of previous multicolor surveys at similar magnitude and redshift range ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . although the current sample is not complete , among the 25 uniformly selected candidates in run 94 ( including the 2 previously known high - redshift quasars ) that have been identified , 15 are quasars at @xmath25 , a success rate of 60% , while previous surveys have had success rates less than 20% . in particular , among the 17 @xmath77 candidates that are identified , 12 are quasars at @xmath25 , a success rate of 70% .",
    "this is due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the high photometric accuracy of the sdss data ; and ( 2 ) the fact that we have been very conservative in our candidate selection (  3 ) .",
    "we expect that as we extend our candidate search to fainter flux levels and nearer to the stellar locus , our success rate will decline .",
    "the success rate of @xmath84 candidates appears much lower ( 3 quasars out of 8 candidates in run 94 , or 38% ) .",
    "the random photometric error in the @xmath20 band is 0.15 mag at @xmath127 for run 94 . for quasars at @xmath128 , where we must rely on the @xmath20 measurements , a large contamination from red stars",
    "is expected .",
    "although the sdss can detect quasars at @xmath129 up to 7 in the @xmath20 band , selection of quasars at @xmath130 ( if they exist ) may prove quite difficult . figure 1(c ) shows that the quasar locus approaches the locus of very late type stars ; this happens for redshifts @xmath131 . at even higher redshifts ,",
    "quasars become undetectable in the @xmath18 band , and additional information in the near ir may be required to distinguish quasars from very red late type stars ( such as l - type stars , @xcite ) .",
    "the survey we have presented here does not result in a complete sample for three reasons .",
    "first , the photometric calibration of these data is preliminary and has larger errors than what will be achieved by the sdss after the commissioning period .",
    "this will affect the selection of our sample at some level , although already our photometric accuracy is superior to that of most previous multicolor searches for high - redshift quasars .",
    "second , the color cuts applied on the data , although objective , are largely arbitrary .",
    "they may miss a considerable fraction of high - redshift quasars , although we have seen that the quasars we have found follow the model quasar locus quite closely .",
    "third , we have not yet finished observing all our candidates .    the current data do not allow us to calculate the selection function reliably , so we do not intend to calculate the quasar number density or luminosity function at high - redshift from these quasars at this time .",
    "however , as a consistency check , we compare the number of quasars observed to date with the predicted number counts from fan ( 1999 ) in table 4 .",
    "fan ( 1999 ) predicts the quasar number counts in sdss bands based on the quasar luminosity function of @xcite for @xmath132 and schmidt , schneider & gunn ( 1995 ) for @xmath10 .",
    "the quasar number counts are based on those identified from run 94 ( 110 deg@xmath2 ) . since we have not observed all the high - redshift quasar candidates , nor do we address the problem of completeness , the observed numbers in table 4 are only lower limits . within the errors from small number statistics ,",
    "the predicted numbers and the numbers observed are consistent .",
    "table 4 shows that although previous surveys have been less efficient than the present work , there is no indication that they missed a large fraction of high - redshift quasars .    even though the data in this study have not yet achieved the sdss survey standards in imaging quality and in photometric calibrations , the high quality ccd data and powerful survey software enable efficient selection of high - redshift quasars .",
    "the data described in this paper cover only @xmath133 1% of the sdss survey area .",
    "the largest samples that have been used in determining the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath10 consist of only @xmath134 quasars ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the entire sdss survey , we expect to find @xmath135 quasars with @xmath10 at @xmath14 , with a significant number of them at @xmath24 .",
    "these quasars will be selected uniformly and will cover a large area of the sky .",
    "this sample will be invaluable in understanding the large scale distribution and evolution of high - redshift quasars , as well as providing bright quasars at high redshift for detailed studies of quasar absorption systems .",
