    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short and intense pulses of soft .",
    "the bursts last from a fraction of a second to several hundred seconds .",
    "grbs arrive from cosmological distances from random directions in the sky . the overall observed",
    "fluences range from @xmath0ergs/@xmath1 to @xmath2ergs/@xmath1 ( the lower limit depends , of course , on the characteristic of the detectors and not on the bursts themselves ) .",
    "this corresponds to isotropic luminosity of @xmath3ergs / sec , making grbs the most luminous objects in the sky .",
    "however , we know today that most grbs are narrowly beamed and the corresponding energies are  only \" around @xmath4ergs @xcite , making them comparable to supernovae in the total energy release .",
    "the grbs are followed by afterglow - lower energy , long lasting emission in the x - ray , optical and radio .",
    "the radio afterglow was observed in some cases several years after the bursts .",
    "the accurate afterglow positions enabled the identification of host galaxies in almost all cases when afterglow was detected and this in turn enabled the determination of the corresponding redshifts that range from 0.16 ( or possibly even down to 0.0085 ) to 4.5 . within the host galaxies",
    "there is evidence that ( long duration ) grbs arise within star forming regions and there is evidence that they follow the star formation rate .",
    "while not all observed features are understood there is an overall agreement between the observations and the fireball model . according to the fireball model grbs",
    "are produced when the kinetic energy of an ultra - relativistic flow is dissipated .",
    "the grb itself is produced by internal dissipation within the flow while the afterglow is produced via external shocks with the circum - burst medium .",
    "i will focus in this review on this model .",
    "the numerous observations of the grb and the observations of the afterglow constrain the fireball model that describes the emitting regions .",
    "the evidence on nature of the inner engine that powers the grb and produces the ultra - relativistic flow is however , indirect .",
    "the energetic requirements and the time scales suggest that grb involve the formation of the black hole via a catastrophic stellar collapse event or possibly a neutron star merger .",
    "additional indirect evidence arises from the requirement of the fireball model of long ( several dozen seconds ) activity of the inner engine .",
    "this hints towards an inner engine built on an accreting black hole . on the other hand",
    ", the evidence of association of grbs with star forming regions indicates that grbs progenitors are massive stars .",
    "finally , the appearance of supernova bumps in the afterglow light curve ( most notably in grb 030329 ) suggest association with supernovae and stellar collapse .",
    "i review here the theory of grb , focusing as mentioned earlier on the fireball internal - external shocks model .",
    "i begin in  [ sec : obs ] with a brief discussion of the observations .",
    "i turn in ",
    "[ sec : accepted ] to some generally accepted properties of grb models - such as the essential ultra - relativistic nature of this phenomenon . before turning to a specific discussion of the fireball model",
    "i review in  [ sec : rel ] several relativistic effects and in  [ sec : physical - processes ] the physical process , such as synchrotron emission or particle acceleration in relativistic shocks that are essential ingredients of this model . in ",
    "[ sec : prompt ] i turn to a discussion of the prompt emission and the grb . in ",
    "[ sec : afterglow ] i discuss modelling the afterglow emission .",
    "i consider other related phenomenon - such as tev emission , high energy neutrinos , ultra high energy cosmic rays and gravitational radiation in  [ sec : other ] .",
    "finally , i turn in  [ sec : inner - engine ] to examine different ` inner engines ' and various aspects related to their activity .",
    "i conclude with a discussion of open questions and observational prospects .    while writing this review i realized how large is the scope of this field and how difficult it is to cover all aspects of this interesting phenomenon .",
    "some important aspects had to be left out .",
    "i also did not attempt to give a complete historical coverage of the field .",
    "i am sure that inadvertently i have missed many important references .",
    "i refer the reader to several other recent review papers @xcite that discuss these and other aspects of grb theory and observations from different points of view .",
    "i begin with a short review of the basic observed properties of grbs .",
    "this review is brief as a complete review requires a whole paper by itself .",
    "i refer the reader to several review papers for a detailed summary of the observations @xcite .",
    "i divide this section to three parts .",
    "i begin with the prompt emission - the grb itself .",
    "i continue with properties of the afterglow .",
    "i conclude with a discussion of the rates of grbs , the location of the bursts within their host galaxies and the properties of the host galaxies .",
    "i begin with a discussion of the grb itself , namely the and any lower - energy emission that occurs simultaneously with them .",
    "this includes emission that generally accompanies the @xmath5-ray emission as a low energy tail . in some cases , called flashes ( xrfs ) ,",
    "the signal is weak and all that we have is this signal .",
    "prompt ( operationally defined as the time period when the -ray detector detects a signal above background ) longer - wavelength emission may also occur at the optical and radio but it is harder to detect .",
    "however , so far optical flashes was observed in three cases @xcite simultaneously with the -ray emission .",
    "the spectrum is non thermal .",
    "the energy flux peaks at a few hundred kev and in many bursts there is a long high energy tail extending in cases up to gev .",
    "the spectrum varies strongly from one burst to another .",
    "an excellent phenomenological fit for the spectrum was introduced by @xcite using two power laws joined smoothly at a break energy @xmath6 : @xmath7^{(\\tilde \\alpha-\\tilde\\beta ) } \\big({h \\nu } \\big)^{\\tilde\\beta } \\exp ( \\tilde \\beta-\\tilde \\alpha ) , & for $ h \\nu > ( \\tilde\\alpha-\\tilde\\beta)e_0,$ \\cr } \\ .\\ ] ] i denote the spectral indices here as @xmath8 and @xmath9 to distinguish them from the afterglow parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) discussed later . there is no particular theoretical model that predicts this spectral shape .",
    "still , this function provides an excellent fit to most of the observed spectra . for most observed values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 peaks at @xmath15 . for",
    "about 10% of the bursts the upper slope is larger than -2 and there is no peak for @xmath16 within the observed spectrum .",
    "another group of bursts , nhe bursts , ( no high energy ) @xcite does not have a hard component ( which is reflected by a very negative value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "the `` typical '' energy of the observed radiation is @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 defined in this way should not be confused with the commonly used hardness ratio which is the ratio of photons observed in two batse channels : channel 3 ( 100 - 300kev ) counts divided by channel 2 ( 50 - 100kev ) counts .",
    "the break frequency and the peak flux frequencies are lower on average for bursts with lower observed flux @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a small catalogue of the spectra of 52 bright bursts which they analyze in terms of the band function . @xcite",
    "present a larger catalogue with 156 bursts selected for either high flux or fluence .",
    "they consider several spectral shape including the band function .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_distribution ] shows the distribution of observed values of the break energy , @xmath6 , in a sample of bright bursts @xcite .",
    "most of the bursts are the range @xmath18 , with a clear maximum in the distribution around @xmath19kev .",
    "there are not many soft grbs - that is , grbs with peak energy in the tens of kev range .",
    "however , the discovery @xcite of xrfs - flashes with similar temporal structure to grbs but lower typical energies - shows that the low peak energy cutoff is not real and it reflects the lower sensitivity of batse in this range @xcite .    .",
    "the solid line represents the whole sample while the dashed line represent a subset of the data .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_distribution ]    similarly , it is debatable whether there is a real paucity in hard grbs and there is an upper cutoff to the grb hardness or it just happens that the detection is optimal in this ( a few hundred kev ) band .",
    "batse triggers , for example , are based mostly on the count rate between 50kev and 300kev .",
    "batse is , therefore , less sensitive to harder bursts that emit most of their energy in the mev range .",
    "using batse s observation alone one can not rule out the possibility that there is a population of harder grbs that emit equal power in total energy which are not observed because of this selection effect @xcite .",
    "more generally , a harder burst with the same energy as a soft one emits fewer photons .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum is generally flat in the high energy range and it decays quickly at low energies .",
    "therefore it is intrinsically more difficult to detect a harder burst .",
    "a study of the smm ( solar maximum mission ) data @xcite suggests that there is a deficiency ( by at least a factor of 5 ) of grbs with hardness above 3mev , relative to grbs peaking at @xmath200.5mev , but this data is consistent with a population of hardness that extends up to 2mev .",
    "overall the narrowness of the hardness distribution is very puzzling .",
    "first , as i stressed earlier it is not clear whether it is real and not a result of an observational artifact .",
    "if it is real then on one hand there is no clear explanation to what is the physical process that controls the narrowness of the distribution ( see however @xcite ) . on the other hand cosmological",
    "redshift effects must broaden this distribution and it seem likely ( but not demonstrated yet ) that if the grb distribution extends to z=10 as some suggest @xcite then such a narrow distribution requires an intrinsic correlation between the intrinsic hardness of the burst and its redshift , namely that the intrinsic hardness increases with the redshift .",
    "there is some evidence for such a correlation between @xmath17 and the observed peak flux @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite reported on a correlation between @xmath17 and the isotropic equivalent energy seen in 12 bepposax bursts that they have analyzed .",
    "they also report on a correlation between @xmath17 and the redshift as , the bursts with higher isotropic equivalent energy are typically more distant .",
    "these three different correlations are consistent with each other if the observed peak flux of bursts is determined by their intrinsic luminosity more than by the distance of the bursts .",
    "in such a case ( because of the larger volume at larger distances ) the observed more distant bursts are on average brighter than nearer ones ( see also  [ sec : hosts - distribution ] ) .",
    "even though the burst hardness distribution shows a single population a plot of the hardness vs temporal duration shows that short bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness - duration ] ) are typically harder @xcite .",
    "the correlation is significant .",
    "another interesting sub - group of bursts is the nhe ( no high energy ) bursts - bursts with no hard component that is no emission above 300kev @xcite .",
    "this group is characterized by a large negative value of @xmath11 , the high energy spectral slope .",
    "the nhe bursts have luminosities about an order of magnitude lower than regular bursts and they exhibit an effectively homogeneous intensity distribution with @xmath21 . as i discuss later in ",
    "[ sec : temp - obs ] most grb light curves are composed of many individual pulses .",
    "it is interesting that in many bursts there are nhe pulses combined with regular pulses .",
    "egret ( the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) the high energy detector on compton - gro detected seven grbs with photon energies ranging from 100 mev to 18 gev @xcite . in some cases",
    "this very high energy emission is delayed more than an hour after the burst @xcite .",
    "no high - energy cutoff above a few mev has been observed in any grb spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite have combined the batse ( 30kev -2mev ) data with the egret data for 26 bursts . in one of these bursts ,",
    "grb 941017 ( according to the common notation grbs are numbered by the date ) , they have discovered a high energy tail that extended up to 200 mev and looked like a different component .",
    "this high energy component appeared 10 - 20 sec after the beginning of the burst and displayed a roughly constant flux with a relatively hard spectral slope ( @xmath22 ) up to 200 sec . at late time",
    "( 150 after the trigger ) the very high energy ( 10 - 200 mev ) tail contained 50 times more energy than the  main \" energy ( 30kev-2mev ) band . the tev detector , milagrito , discovered ( at a statistical significance of 1.5e-3 or so , namely at 3@xmath23 ) a tev signal coincident with grb 970417 @xcite .",
    "if true this would correspond to a tev fluence that exceeds the low energy fluence .",
    "however no further tev signals were discovered from other 53 bursts observed by milagrito @xcite or from several bursts observed by the more sensitive milagro @xcite .",
    "one should recall however , that due to the attenuation of the ir background tev photons could not be detected from @xmath24 .",
    "thus even if most grbs emit tev photons those photons wo nt be detected on earth .",
    "another puzzle is the low energy tail .",
    "@xcite analyze several strong bursts and find that their low energy slope is around 1/3 to -1/2 .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that about 1/5 of the bursts have a the low energy power spectrum , @xmath10 , steeper than 1/3 ( the synchrotron slow cooling low energy slope )",
    ". a larger fraction is steeper than -1/2 ( the fast cooling synchrotron low energy slope ) .",
    "however , this is not seen in any of the hete spectrum whose low energy resolution is somewhat better .",
    "all hete bursts have a low energy spectrum that is within the range 1/3 and -1/2 @xcite . as both batse and hete use nai detectors that have a poor low energy resolution @xcite",
    ", this problem might be resolved only when a better low energy spectrometer will be flown .",
    "the duration of the bursts spans five orders , ranging from less than 0.01sec to more than 100sec .",
    "common measures for the duration are @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) which correspond to the time in which 90% ( 50% ) of the counts of the grb arrives . as i discuss below ( see  [ sec : pop ] )",
    "the bursts are divided to long and short bursts according to their @xmath25 .",
    "most grbs are highly variable , showing 100% variations in the flux on a time scale much shorter than the overall duration of the burst .",
    "fig [ fig : variable ] depicts the light curve of a typical variable grb ( grb 920627 ) .",
    "the variability time scale , @xmath27 , is determined by the width of the peaks .",
    "@xmath27 is much shorter ( in some cases by a more than a factor of @xmath28 ) than @xmath29 , the duration of the burst .",
    "variability on a time scale of milliseconds has been observed in some long bursts @xcite .",
    "however , only @xmath30% of the bursts show substantial substructure in their light curves .",
    "the rest are rather smooth , typically with a fred ( fast rise exponential decay ) structure .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) discovered a correlation between the variability and the luminosity of the bursts .",
    "this correlation ( as well as the lag - luminosity relation discussed later ) allow us to estimate the luminosity of bursts that do not have a known redshift .",
    "the bursts seem to be composed of individual pulses , with a pulse being the  building blocks \" of the overall light curve .",
    "individual pulses display a hard to soft evolution with the peak energy decreasing exponentially with the photon fluence @xcite .",
    "the pulses have the following temporal and spectral features .",
    "( i ) the light curve of an individual pulse is a fred - fast rise exponential decay - with an average rise to decay ratio of 1:3 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the low energy emission is delayed compared to the high energy emissionkev . ]",
    "@xcite have found that these spectral lags are anti - correlated with the luminosity of the bursts : luminous bursts have long lags .",
    "this lag luminosity relation provides another way to estimate the luminosity of a burst from its ( multi - spectra ) light curve .",
    "( iii ) the pulses low energy light curves are wider compared to the high energy light curves .",
    "the width goes as @xmath31@xcite .",
    "( iv ) there is a width - symmetry - intensity correlation .",
    "high intensity pulses are ( statistically ) more symmetric ( lower decay to rise ratio ) and with shorter spectral lags @xcite .",
    "( v ) there is a hardness - intensity correlation .",
    "the instantaneous spectral hardness of a pulse is correlated to the instantaneous intensity ( the pulse become softer during the pulse decay ) @xcite .",
    "both the pulse widths , @xmath27 , and the pulse separation,@xmath32 , have a rather similar log - normal distributions .",
    "however , the pulse separation , distribution , reveals has an excess of long intervals @xcite .",
    "these long intervals can be classified as quiescent periods @xcite , relatively long periods of several dozen seconds with no activity . when excluding these quiescent periods both distributions are log - normal with a comparable parameters @xcite . the average pulse interval , @xmath33 is larger by a factor 1.3 then the average pulse width @xmath34 .",
    "one also finds that the pulse widths are correlated with the preceding interval @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the pulses width does not vary along the bursts .",
    "one can also analyze the temporal behavior using the traditional fourier transform method to analyze .",
    "the power density spectra ( pds ) of light curves shows a power law slope of @xmath35 and a sharp break at 1hz @xcite .",
    "the results described so far are for long bursts .",
    "the variability of short ( @xmath36sec ) bursts is more difficult to analyze .",
    "the duration of these bursts is closer to the limiting resolution of the detectors .",
    "still most ( @xmath37 ) short bursts are variable with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "these variable bursts are composed of multiple subpulses .",
    "* long and short bursts * the clearest classification of bursts is based on their duration . @xcite",
    "have shown that grb can be divided to two distinct groups : long burst with @xmath39sec and short bursts with @xmath40sec .",
    "note that it was suggested @xcite that there is a third intermediate class with @xmath41sec .",
    "however , it is not clear if this division to three classes is statistically significant @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether short bursts could arise from single peaks of long bursts in which the rest of the long burst is hidden by noise . @xcite",
    "have shown that in practically all long bursts the second highest peak is comparable in height to the first one .",
    "thus , if the highest peak is above the noise so should be the second one .",
    "short bursts are a different entity .",
    "this is supported by the observation that short bursts are typically harder @xcite . the duration - hardness distribution ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hardness - duration ] ) shows clearly that there are not soft short bursts .",
    "the spatial distribution of the * observed * short bursts is clearly different from the distribution of the * observed * long one .",
    "a measure of the spatial distribution is the average ratio @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the count rate and @xmath44 is the minimal rate required for triggering . in a uniform eucleadian sample",
    "this ratio equals @xmath45 regardless of the luminosity function .",
    "one of the first signs of a cosmological origin of grbs was the deviation of this value from 0.5 for the batse sample @xcite .",
    "the the @xmath46 of the batse short bursts sample @xcite is significantly higher than @xmath47 of the long bursts sample .",
    "note that more recently @xcite suggested that the two values are similar and the distribution of long and short bursts is similar .",
    "however , @xcite finds @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( i discuss this point further in  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "this implies that the population of * observed * short bursts is nearer on average than the population of the observed long ones .",
    "this is not necessarily a statement on the location of short vs. the location of long bursts .",
    "instead it simply reflects the fact that it is more difficult to detect a short burst . for a short burst one has to trigger on a shorter ( and hence noisier ) window the detector ( specifically batse that triggers on 64 ms for short bursts and on 1 sec for long ones ) is less sensitive to short bursts .",
    "i discuss later , in ",
    "[ sec : rates ] , the question of rates of long vs. short bursts .",
    "so far afterglow was detected only from long bursts .",
    "it is not clear whether this is an observational artifact or a real feature .",
    "however , there was no afterglow observed for the only well localized short hard burst : grb020531 @xcite .",
    "chandra observations show an intensity weaker by at least a factor of 100 - 300 than the intensity of the afterglow from long bursts at a similar time @xcite .",
    "afterglow was not observed in other wavelength as well @xcite    as identification of hosts and redshifts depend on the detection of afterglow this implies that nothing is known about the distribution , progenitors , environment etc .. of short burst .",
    "these bursts are still waiting for their afterglow revolution .",
    "* flashes * ( xrfs ) are bursts with a similar temporal structure to grbs but lower typical energies .",
    "@xcite discovered these flushes by comparing grbm ( grb monitor ) with sensitivity above 40 kev and wfc ( wide field camera ) triggering on bepposax . in 39 cases",
    "the wfcs were triggered without grbm triggering implying that these flashed do not have any hard component and most of their flux is in .",
    "the duration of 17 of these transients ( out of the 39 transients ) , denoted flashes ( xrfs ) , is comparable to the duration of the x - ray emission accompanying grbs .",
    "the peak fluxes of the xrfs are similar to the fluxes observed during grbs in the wfcs ( @xmath50ergs / sec/@xmath1 ) but their peak energy is clearly below 40 kev .",
    "these finding confirmed the detection of @xcite of 7 grbs with @xmath51kev and 5 additional grbs with @xmath52kev in the ginga data .",
    "@xcite analyze 35 bursts detected on hete ii .",
    "they find that xrfs lie on the extension of all the relevant grb distributions .",
    "namely there is a continuity from grbs to xrfs .",
    "detailed searches in the batse data revealed that some of these bursts have also been detected by batse @xcite . using the complete search in 90% of the wfc data available ,",
    "@xcite find that the observed frequency of xrfs is approximately half of the grb - frequency : in 6 years of bepposax observations they have observed 32 xrfs above a threshold peak - luminosity of @xmath53erg / s/@xmath1 in the 2 - 25 kev range compared with 54 grbs ( all grbs above batse thresholds are observed if in the field of view ) .    by",
    "now @xcite discovered optical afterglow from xrf 020903 and they suggest that the burst was at @xmath54 .",
    "they also suggest a hint of an underlying sn signal ( see  [ sec : obs - sn ] ) peaking between  7 - 24 days after the initial xrf trigger .",
    "afterglow was discovered from xrf 030723as well @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on a detection of a very high ( @xmath55 ) linear polarization during the prompt @xmath56-ray emission of grb 021206 .",
    "this burst was extremely powerful .",
    "the observed fluence of grb 021206 was @xmath57 at the energy range of 25 - 100kev @xcite .",
    "this puts grb 021206 as one of the most powerful bursts , and the most powerful one ( a factor of 2 - 3 above grb990123 ) after correcting for the fact that it was observed only in a narrow band ( compared to the wide batse band of 20 - 2000kev ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data recorded by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) .",
    "the polarization is measured in this detector by the angular dependence of the number detection of simultaneous pairs of events that are most likely caused by a scattering of the detected within the detector .",
    "the data data analysis is based on 12 data points which are collected over 5sec .",
    "each of these points is a sum of several independent observations taken at different times .",
    "thus the data is some kind of convolution of the polarization over the whole duration of the burst .",
    "@xcite test two hypothesis .",
    "first they test the null hypothesis of no polarization .",
    "this hypothesis is rejected at a confidence level of @xmath58 .",
    "second they estimate the modulation factor assuming a constant polarization during the whole burst .",
    "the best fit to the data is achieved with @xmath59 .",
    "however , @xcite find that the probability that @xmath60 is greater than the value obtained with this fit is 5% , namely the model of constant polarization is consistent with the analysis and observations only at the 5% level .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed this data and pointed out several inconsistencies within the methodology of @xcite .",
    "their upper limit on the polarization ( based on the same data ) is @xmath61 . in their rebuttle",
    "@xcite point out that the strong upper limit ( obtained by @xcite is inconsistent with the low s / n estimated by these authors .",
    "however , they do not provide a clear answer to the criticism of the methodology raised by @xcite .",
    "this leaves the situation , concerning the prompt polarization from this burst highly uncertain .",
    "the robotic telescope rotse ( robotic optical transient search experiment ) detected a 9th magnitude optical flash that was concurrent with the grb emission from grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "the six snapshots begun 40sec after the trigger and lasted until three minutes after the burst . the second snapshot that took place 60sec after the trigger recorded a 9th magnitude flash .",
    "while the six snapshots do not provide a  light curve \" it is clear that the peak optical flux does not coincide with the peak emission that takes place around the first rotse snapshot .",
    "this suggests that the optical flux is not the  low energy tail \" of the emission .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on a detection of 15.45 magnitude optical signal from grb 021004 193 sec after the trigger .",
    "this is just 93 seconds after the 100 sec long burst stopped being active .",
    "shortly afterwards @xcite reported on a detection of 14.67 magnitude optical signal from grb 021211 105 sec after the trigger .",
    "finally , @xcite detected a 12th magnitude prompt flash , albeit this is more than 1.5 hours after the trigger .",
    "similar prompt signal was not observed from any other burst in spite of extensive searches that provided upper limits .",
    "@xcite searched 5 bright bursts and found single - image upper limits ranging from 13th to 14th magnitude around 10 sec after the initial burst detection and from 14 to 15.8 magnitudes one hour later .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the two recent detections which are around 15th mag .",
    "the recent events of rapid detection suggest that we should expect many more such discoveries in the near future .",
    "there is no direct correlation between the @xmath5-ray fluxes and the ( or optical ) afterglow fluxes .",
    "the extrapolation of the afterglow fluxes backwards generally does not fit the @xmath5-ray fluxes .",
    "instead they fit the late prompt signal .",
    "these results are in nice agreement with the predictions of the internal - external shocks scenario in which the two phenomena are produced by different effects and one should not expect a simple extrapolation to work .    the expected grb afterglow transition have been observed in several cases .",
    "the first observation took place ( but was not reported until much latter ) already in 1992 @xcite .",
    "bepposax data shows a rather sharp transition in the hardness that takes place several dozen seconds after the beginning of the bursts .",

    "second , they are more distant than grbs with ot , at @xmath83 @xcite , so that the lyman break is redshifted into the optical band .",
    "nevertheless , the distances of a few dark grbs have been determined and they do not imply high redshifts @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that the optical afterglow of dark grbs is intrinsically much fainter ( 2 - 3 mag below ) than that of other grbs .",
    "@xcite find that grbs with optical transients show a remarkably narrow distribution of flux ratios , which corresponds to an average optical - to - x spectral index @xmath84 .",

    "@xcite also suggests that this difference might rise due to an observational bias and that grbs that arise in dust - enshrouded infrared starbursts are dark grbs whose afterglow is not detectable due to obscuration . whether this is tru or not is very relevant to the interesting question to which extend grbs follow the sfr and to which extend they can be used to determine the sfr at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that grbs follow the star formation rate .",
    "as early as 1998 @xcite noted that all four early grbs with spectroscopic identification or deep multicolor broadband imaging of the host ( grb 970228 grb 970508 , grb 971214 , and grb 980703 ) lie in rapidly star - forming galaxies . within the host galaxies",

    "the light is roughly proportional to the density of star formation .",
    "spectroscopic measurements suggest that grbs are within galaxies with a higher sfr . however , this is typical for normal field galaxy population at comparable redshifts @xcite .",
    "there are some intriguing hints , in particular the flux ratios of [ ne iii ] 3859 to [ oii ] 3727 are on average a factor of 4 to 5 higher in grb hosts than in star forming galaxies at low redshifts @xcite",
    ". this may represent an indirect evidence linking grbs with massive star formation .",
    "the link between grbs and massive stars has been strengthened with the centimeter and submillimeter discoveries of grb host galaxies @xcite undergoing prodigious star formation ( sfr@xmath94 m@xmath95 yr@xmath96 ) , which remains obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "evidence for a different characteristics of grb host galaxies arise from the work of @xcite who find that grb host galaxies  always \" show lyman alpha emission in cases where a suitable search has been conducted .",
    "this back up the claim for active star formation and at most moderate metallicity in grb hosts .",
    "it clearly distinguishes grb hosts from the lyman break galaxy population , in which only about 1/4 of galaxies show strong lyman alpha .",
    "batse s discovery that the bursts are distributed uniformly on the sky @xcite was among the first indication of the cosmological nature of grbs .",
    "the uniform distribution indicated that grbs are not associated with the galaxy or with  local \" structure in the near universe .",
    "recently there have been several claims that sub - groups of the whole grb population shows a deviation from a uniform distribution .",
    "@xcite , for example , find that the angular distribution of the intermediate sub - group of bursts ( more specifically of the weak intermediate sub - group ) is not random .",
    "@xcite reported that the two - point angular correlation function of 407 short batse grbs reveal a @xmath97 deviation from isotropy on angular scales @xmath98 .",
    "this results is consistent with the possibility that observed short grbs are nearer and the angular correlation is induced by the large scale structure correlations on this scale .",
    "these claims are important as they could arise only if these bursts are relatively nearby .",
    "alternatively this indicates repetition of these sources @xcite .",

    "they find that there is a significant angular asymmetry and the @xmath99 distribution provides evidence for a homogeneous sources distribution .",
    "they suggest that these features are best interpreted as sources of a galactic origin .",
    "however , one has to realize that there are strong selection effects that are involved in the detection of this particular subgroup .",
    "there have been many attempts to determine the grb luminosity function and rate from the batse peak flux distribution .",
    "this was done by numerous using different levels of statistical sophistication and different physical assumptions on the evolution of the rate of grbs with time and on the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "roughly speaking the situation is the following .",
    "there are now more than 30 redshift measured .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath100 and the redshift range is from 0.16 ( or even 0.0085 if the association of grb 980425 with sn 98bw should be also considered ) to 4.5 ( for grb 000131 ) .",
    "direct estimates from the sample of grbs with determined redshifts are contaminated by observational biases and are insufficient to determine the rate and luminosity function .",
    "an alternative approach is to estimates these quantities from the batse peak flux distribution .",
    "however , the observed sample with a known redshifts clearly shows that the luminosity function is wide . with a wide luminosity function ,",
    "the rate of grb is only weakly constraint by the peak flux distribution .",
    "the analysis is further complicated by the fact that the observed peak luminosity , at a given detector with a given observation energy band depends also on the intrinsic spectrum . hence different assumptions on the spectrum yield different results .",
    "this situation suggest that there is no point in employing sophisticated statistical tools ( see however , @xcite for a discussion of these methods ) and a simple analysis is sufficient to obtain an idea on the relevant parameters .",
    "i will not attempt to review the various approaches here .",
    "a partial list of calculations includes @xcite . instead i will just quote results of some estimates of the rates and luminosities of grbs .",
    "the simplest approach is to fit @xmath101 , which is the first moment of the peak flux distribution .",
    "@xcite finds using @xmath102 of the long burst distribution and assuming that the bursts follow the @xcite sfr2 , that the present local rate of long observed grbs is @xmath103 @xcite .",

    "their best fit luminosity function ( per logarithmic luminosity interval , @xmath106 ) is : @xmath107 and 0 otherwise with a typical luminosity , @xmath108ergs / sec , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is a normalization constant so that the integral over the luminosity function equals unity .",
    "the corresponding local grb rate is @xmath112gpc@xmath96yr@xmath96 .",
    "there is an uncertainty of a factor of @xmath113 in the typical energy , @xmath114 , and in the local rate .",
    "i will use these numbers as the  canonical \" values in the rest of this review .",
    "the observed ( batse ) rate of short grbs is smaller by a factor of three than the rate of long ones .",
    "however , this is not the ratio of the real rates as : ( i ) the batse detector is less sensitive to short bursts than to long ones ; ( ii ) the true rate depends on the spatial distribution of the short bursts . so far no redshift was detected for any short bursts and hence this distribution is uncertain . for short bursts we can resort only to estimates based on the peak flux distribution .",
    "there are indications that @xmath102 of short burst is larger ( and close to the eucleadian value of 0.5 ) than the @xmath101 value of long ones ( which is around 0.32 ) .",
    "this implies that the observed short bursts are nearer to us that the long ones @xcite possible with all observed short bursts are at @xmath115 .",
    "however , @xcite finds for short bursts @xmath116 , which is rather close to the value of long bursts . assuming that short grbs also follow the sfr he obtains a local rate of @xmath117 - a factor of two below the rate of long grbs !",
    "the ( isotropic ) peak luminosities are comparable .",
    "this results differs from a recent calculation of @xcite who find for short bursts @xmath118 and determine from this a local rate of @xmath119 which is about four times the rate of long bursts .",
    "this reflects the fact that the * observed * short grbs are significantly nearer than the * observed * long ones .",
    "these rates and luminosities are assuming that the bursts are * isotropic*. beaming reduces the actual peak luminosity increases the implied rate by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "by now there is evidence that grbs are beamed and moreover the total energy in narrowly distributed @xcite .",
    "there is also a good evidence that the corrected peak luminosity is much more narrowly distributed than the isotropic peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "the corrected peak luminosity is @xmath121 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the true rate is larger by a factor of 500 than the observed isotropic estimated rate . however , @xcite repeated this calculation performing a careful average over the luminosity function and find that that true rate is only a factor of @xmath122 times the isotropically estimate one .",
    "over all the true rate is : @xmath123 .    with increasing number of grbs with redshifts it may be possible soon to determine the grb redshift distribution directly from this data .",
    "however , it is not clear what are the observational biases that influence this data set and one needs a homogenous data set in order to perform this calculation .",
    "alternatively one can try to determine luminosity estimators @xcite from the subset with known redshifts and to obtain , using them a redshift distribution for the whole grb sample .",
    "@xcite find using the @xcite sample that this method implies that ( i ) the rate of grbs increases backwards with time even for @xmath124 , ( ii ) the luminosity of grbs increases with redshift as @xmath125 ; ( iii ) hardness and luminosity are strongly correlated .",
    "it is not clear how these features , which clearly depend on the inner engine could depend strongly on the redshift .",
    "note that in view of the luminosity - angle relation ( see  [ sec : energetics ] below ) the luminosity depends mostly on the opening angle .",
    "an increase of the luminosity with redshift would imply that grbs were more narrowly collimated at earlier times .",
    "the association of grbs with star forming regions and the indications that grbs follow the star formation rate suggest that grbs are related to stellar death , namely to supernovae @xcite .",
    "additionally there is some direct evidence of association of grbs with supernovae .    *",
    "grb 980425 and sn98bw : * the first indication of an association between grbs and snes was found when sn 98bw was discovered within the error box of grb 980425 @xcite .",
    "this was an usual type ic sn which was much brighter than most sns .",
    "typical ejection velocities in the sn were larger than usual ( @xmath126 ) corresponding to a kinetic energy of @xmath127 ergs , more than ten times than previously known energy of snes , @xcite .",

    "thus , 1998bw was an unusual type ic supernovae , significantly more powerful than comparable snes .",

    "indeed all other observations of sn signature in grb afterglow light curves use a sn 98bw templates .",
    "the accompanying grb , 980425 was also unusual .",

    "the nfi could associate with each of these 2 sources an error circle of 1.5 arcmin radius .",
    "the radio and optical position of sn1998bw were consistent only with the nfi error circle of s1 , and was out of the nfi error circle of s2 .",
    "therefore , @xcite identified s1 with x - ray emission from sn1998bw , although this was of course no proof of association between sn and grb .",
    "it was difficult , based only on the bepposax nfi data , to characterize the behavior and variability of s2 and it could not be excluded that s2 was the afterglow of grb980425 .",
    "the xmm observations of march 2002 @xcite seem to have brought us closer to the solution .",
    "xmm detects well s1 , and its flux is lower than in 1998 : the sn emission has evidently decreased .",

    "s2 seems to be not a single source , but a group of small faint sources .",
    "their random variability ( typical fluctuations of x - ray sources close to the level of the background ) may have caused the flickering detected for s2 .",

    "the observed break corresponds in this model to the observing angle @xmath138 and not to the opening angle of the jet .",

    "this might seen at first sight contrary to expectation as narrower beams imply more grbs .",
    "but , on the other hand , with narrower beams each grb has a lower energy and hence its radio afterglow is more difficult to detect .",
    "overall the second factor wins . using the results of first and nvss surveys they find nine afterglow candidates .",
    "if all candidates are associated with grbs then there is a lower limit on the beaming factor of @xmath157 .",

    "when considering the energy of grbs one has to remember the possibility , as some models suggest , that an additional energy is emitted which is not involved in the grb itself or in the afterglow .",
    "@xcite , for example , suggest that a powerful newtonian wind collimates the less powerful relativistic one .",
    "the  standard jet \" model also suggests a large amount of energy emitted sideways with a lower energy per solid angle and a lower lorentz factors .",
    "it is interesting to note that the calorimetric estimates mentioned earlier limit the total amount of energy ejected regardless of the nature of the flow .",
    "more generally , typically during the afterglow matter moving with a lower lorentz factor emits lower frequencies .",

    "@xcite use various searches for orphan afterglow to limit the ( hard ) energy to be at most comparable to the energy .",
    "this implies that the total energy of matter moving at a lorentz factor of @xmath161 is at most comparable to the energy of matter moving with a lorentz factor of a few hundred and producing the grb itself . at present limits on optical orphan afterglow",
    "are insufficient to set significant limits on matter moving at slower rate , while as mentioned earlier radio observations already limit the overall energy output .",
    "these observations wo nt limit , of course , the energy emitted in gravitational radiation , neutrinos , cosmic rays or very high energy photons that may be emitted simultaneously by the source and influence the sourcee energy budget without influencing the afterglow .",
    "there are several generally accepted ingredients in practically all current grb models",

    "this is essential to overcome the compactness problem ( see  [ sec : comp ] below ) . at first",
    "this understanding was based only on theoretical arguments .",
    "however , now there are direct observational proofs of this concept : it is now generally accepted that both the radio scintillation @xcite and the lower frequency self - absorption @xcite provide independent estimates of the size of the afterglow , @xmath89 cm , two weeks after the burst .",
    "these observations imply that the afterglow has indeed expanded relativistically .",
    "@xcite suggested that the optical flash accompanying grb 990123 provided a direct evidence for ultra - relativistic motion with @xmath163 .",
    "@xcite find a higher value : @xmath164 .",
    "however , these interpretations are model dependent .",
    "the relativistic motion implies that we observe blue shifted photons which are significantly softer in the moving rest frame .",
    "it also implies that when the objects have a size @xmath165 the observed emission arrives on a typical time scale of @xmath166 ( see  [ sec : temporal ] ) .",
    "relativistic beaming also implies that we observe only a small fraction ( @xmath167 ) of the source . as i discussed earlier ( see  [ sec : energetics ] and also [ sec : patchy - shell ] ) this has important implications on our ability to estimate the total energy of grbs .",
    "while all models are based on ultra - relativistic motion , none explains convincingly ( this is clearly a subjective statement ) how this relativistic motion is attained .",
    "there is no agreement even on the nature of the relativistic flow .",
    "while in some models the energy is carried out in the form of kinetic energy of baryonic outflow in others it is a poynting dominated flow or both .",
    "* dissipation * in most models the energy of the relativistic flow is dissipated and this provides the energy needed for the grb and the subsequent afterglow .",
    "the dissipation is in the form of ( collisionless ) shocks , possibly via plasma instability .",
    "there is a general agreement that the afterglow is produced via external shocks with the circumburst matter ( see [ sec : afterglow ] ) .",
    "there is convincing evidence ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and  [ sec : ex - int ] below ) that in most bursts the dissipation during the grb phase takes place via internal shocks , namely shocks within the relativistic flow itself .",
    "some ( see e.g. @xcite ) disagree with this statement .",
    "* synchrotron radiation : * most models ( both of the grb and the afterglow ) are based on synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated within the shocks .",

    "these are also supported by measurements of linear polarization in several optical afterglows ( see  [ sec : obs - opt ] ) .",
    "as for the grb itself there are various worries about the validity of this model .",
    "in particular there are some inconsistencies between the observed special slopes and those predicted by the synchrotron model ( see @xcite and  [ sec : spec - obs ] ) .",
    "the main alternative to synchrotron emission is synchrotron - self compton @xcite or inverse compton of external light @xcite .",
    "the last model requires , of course a reasonable source of external light .    * jets and collimation : * monochromatic breaks appear in many afterglow light curves .",
    "these breaks are interpreted as  jet breaks \" due to the sideways beaming of the relativistic emission @xcite ( when the lorentz factor drops below @xmath168 the radiation is beamed outside of the original jet reducing the observed flux ) and due to the sideways spreading of a beamed flow @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is of a viewing angles of a ",
    "universal structured jet \" @xcite whose energy varies with the angle .",
    "both interpretations suggest that grbs are beamed .",
    "however , they give different estimates of the overall rate and the energies of grbs ( see  [ sec : structured ] below ) . in either case",
    "the energy involved with grbs is smaller than the naively interpreted isotropic energy and the rate is higher than the observed rate .    * a ( newborn ) compact object *",
    "if one accepts the beaming interpretation of the breaks in the optical light curve the total energy release in grbs is @xmath104ergs @xcite .",
    "it is higher if , as some models suggest , the beaming interpretation is wrong or if a significant amount of additional energy ( which does not contribute to the grb or to the afterglow ) is emitted from the source .",
    "this energy , @xmath104ergs , is comparable to the energy released in a supernovae .",
    "it indicates that the process must involve a compact object .",
    "no other known source can release so much energy within such a short time scale .",

    "this has lead to the understanding that ( long ) grb arise from the collapse of massive stars ( see  [ sec : collapsar ] ) .",

    "* summary : * based on these generally accepted ideas one can sketch the following generic grb model : grbs are a rare phenomenon observed within star forming regions and associated with the death of massive stars and the birth of compact objects .",

    "[ fig : thinshell ] .",
    "as i discuss later ( see  [ sec : ex - int ] ) the similarity between the angular time scale and the radial time scale plays a crucial role in grb models .",

    "the inhomogeneity of individual shells could be wiped out when the contributions of different hot spots from different shells is added . alternatively the ",
    "inner engine \" may produce a consistent angular pattern in which the hot spot is in the same position in all shells and in this case averaging wo nt lead to a cancellation of the patchy shell structure .",

    "this has several inevitable implications .",
    "if the initial relativistic flow is inhomogenous on a small angular scale then different observers looking at the same grb ( from different viewing angles ) will see different light curves .",
    "a strong burst to one observer might look weak to another one if it is located at an angle larger than @xmath167 from the first .",
    "the two observers will see similar conditions later on , during the afterglow , as then they will observe the same angular regions .",
    "this has the following implications : ( i ) given that the grb population originate from some ` typical ' distribution we expect that fluctuation between different bursts at early time during the grb will be larger than fluctuations observed at late times during the afterglow @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of this behaviour is the appearance of a bias in the observations of grbs .",
    "as we are more likely to detect stronger events we will tend to identify bursts in which a  hot spot  was pointing towards us during the grb phase . if the original grb shells are inhomogenous this would inevitably lead to a bias in the estimates of the grb emission as compared to the kinetic energy during the afterglow .",
    "( ii ) as the afterglow slows down we observe a larger and larger region .",
    "the angular structure would produces a variability in the light curve with a typical time scale of t , the observed time .",
    "these fluctuations will decay later as the lorentz factor decreases and the observations are averaged over a larger viewing angle . @xcite",
    "have suggested that this is the source of the early fluctuations in the light curve of grb 021004 .",
    "@xcite modelled this process with a numerical simulation .",
    "they find that the flucutation light curve of grb 021004 can be nicely fitted by this model and that it also explains the correlated fluctuations in the polarization ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the observed prompt emission must be generated by energetic particles that have been accelerated within the collisionless shocks .",
    "the most likely process is synchrotron emission , even though there is some evidence that a simple synchrotron spectra does not fit all bursts @xcite ( but see however , @xcite who finds consistency with the synchrotron model ) .",
    "i consider here , the different physical ingredient that determine the emission process : particle acceleration , magnetic field amplification , synchrotron emission and inverse compton emission that could be relevant in some cases .",
    "shocks involve sharp jumps in the physical conditions .",
    "conservation of mass , energy and momentum determine the hugoniot shock jump conditions across the relativistic shocks for the case when the upstream matter is cold ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath213 where @xmath214,@xmath215 are the number density and the energy density ( measured in the local rest frame ) of the matter upstream ( region 1 ) and downstream ( region 2 ) .",

    "observations of grbs typically show asymmetric spikes in the intensity variation , where a peak generally has a fast rise and a slower decay .",
    "a plausible explanation of this observation is that the shock heating of the electrons happens rapidly ( though episodically ) , and that the rise time of a spike is related to the heating time .",
    "the decay time is then set by the cooling , so that the widths of spikes directly measure the cooling time .",
    "however , it seems that there are problems with this simple explanation .",
    "first when plugging reasonable parameters one finds that the decay time as implied by this equation is too short .",
    "second , if the cooling time is long the shocked region would suffer adiabatic losses and this would reduce the efficiency of the process . thus it is unlikely that the pulse shapes can be explained by synchrotron physics alone .",

    "thus , both effects lead to an averaging over the angular structure at later times .",
    "several authors @xcite suggested independently a different interpretation to the observed achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves .",
    "this interpretation is based on a jet with a regular angular structure . according to this model all grbs",
    "are produced by a jet with a fixed angular structure and the break corresponds to the viewing angle .",
    "@xcite considered a  universal \" jet with a 3-step profile : a spherical one , a @xmath706 one and a @xmath707 one . @xcite and @xcite considered a special profile where the energy per solid angle , @xmath708 , and the lorentz factor @xmath709 are : @xmath710 and @xmath711 where @xmath712 is a maximal angle and core angle , @xmath713 , is introduced to avoid a divergence at @xmath714 and the parameters @xmath523 and @xmath715 here define the energy and lorentz factor angular dependence .",

    "then the matter begins to expand sideways .",
    "the resulting light curve is calculated by averaging the detected light resulting from the different angles .",
    "they find that an observer at an angle @xmath722 will detect a break in the light curve that appears around the time that @xmath723 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rossi ] ) .",
    "a simple explanation of break is the following : as the evolution proceeds and the lorentz factor decreases an observer will detect emission from a larger and larger angular regions . initially the additional higher energy at small angles , @xmath724 compensates over the lower energies at larger angles @xmath725 .",
    "hence the observer detects a roughly constant energy per solid angle and the resulting light curve is comparable to the regular pre - jet break light curve .",
    "this goes on until @xmath726 . after this stage",
    "an further increase in the viewing angle @xmath209 will result in a decrease of the energy per unit solid angle within the viewing cone and will lead to a break in the light curve .",
    "this interpretation of the breaks in the light curves in terms of the viewing angles of a standard structured jets implies a different understanding of total energy within grb jets and of the rate of grbs .",

    "@xcite find that the light curves of models 1 and 2 are rather similar in spite of the different physical assumptions .",
    "this suggests that the widening of the viewing angle has a more dominant effect than the physical averaging . for models with",
    "a constant energy and a variable lorentz factor ( @xmath730 ) the light curve initially rises and there is no jet break , which is quite different from observations for most afterglows . for @xmath731",

    "for @xmath734 the value , @xmath735 , of the temporal decay slope at @xmath736 increases with @xmath722 , while @xmath737 decreases with @xmath722 .",

    ", there is a flattening of the light curve just before the jet break ( also noticed by @xcite ) , for @xmath740 .",
    "again , this effect is larger in model 1 , compared to model 2 and again this flattening is not seen in the observed data .",
    "clearly a full solution of an angular dependent jet requires full numerical simulations . @xcite present a simple 1-d model for the hydrodynamics that is obtained by assuming axial symmetry and integrating over the radial profile of the flow , thus considerably reducing the computation time .",
    "the light curves that they find resemble those of models 1 and 2 above indicating that these crude approximations are useful .",

    "synchrotron emission from a jet ( in which the spherical symmetry is broken ) would naturally produce polarized emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , the level and the direction of the polarization are expected to vary with time and to give observational clues on the geometrical structure of the emitting jet and our observing angle with respect to it .",
    "the key feature in the determination of the polarization during the afterglow is the varying lorentz factor and ( after jet break ) varying jet width",
    ". this changes changes the overall geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_random ] ) and hence the observer sees different geometries @xcite .",
    "initially , the relativistic beaming angle @xmath167 is narrower than the physical size of the jet @xmath742 , and the observer see a full ring and therefore the radial polarization averages out ( the first frame , with @xmath743 of the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : polfig ] ) . as the flow decelerates ,",
    "the relativistic beaming angle @xmath167 becomes comparable to @xmath742 and only a fraction of the ring is visible ; net polarization is then observed . assuming , for simplicity , that the magnetic field is along the shock",
    "then the synchrotron polarization will be radially outwards .",
    "due to the radial direction of the polarization from each fluid element , the total polarization is maximal when a quarter ( @xmath744 in figure [ fig : polfig ] ) or when three quarters ( @xmath745 in figure [ fig : polfig ] ) of the ring are missing ( or radiate less efficiently ) and vanishes for a full and a half ring .",
    "the polarization , when more than half of the ring is missing , is perpendicular to the polarization direction when less than half of it is missing .    at late stages",
    "the jet expands sideways and since the offset of the observer from the physical center of the jet is constant , spherical symmetry is regained .",
    "the vanishing and re - occurrence of significant parts of the ring results in a unique prediction : there should be three peaks of polarization , with the polarization position angle during the central peak rotated by @xmath746 with respect to the other two peaks . in case",
    "the observer is very close to the center , more than half of the ring is always observed , and therefore only a single direction of polarization is expected .",

    "[ fig : polfig ] .",
    "the predicted polarization from a structured jet is drastically different from the one from a uniform jet , providing an excellent test between the two models @xcite . within the structured jet model the polarization arises due to the gradient in the emissivity .",

    "the polarization will be maximal when the variation in the emissivity within the emitting beam are maximal .",
    "this happens around the jet break when @xmath747 and the observed beam just reaches the center .",
    "the polarization expected in this case is around 20% @xcite and it is slightly larger than the maximal polarization from a uniform jet . as the direction of the gradient is always the same ( relative to a given observer ) there should be no jumps in the direction of the polarization .    according to the patchy shell model @xcite",
    "the jet can includes variable emitting hot spots .",
    "this could lead to a fluctuation in the light curve ( as hot spots enter the observed beam ) and also to corresponding fluctuations in the polarization @xcite .",
    "there is a clear prediction @xcite that if the fluctuations are angular fluctuations have a typical angular scale @xmath748 then the first bump in the light curve should take place on the time when @xmath749 ( the whole hot spot will be within the observed beam ) .",
    "the following bumps in the light curve should decrease in amplitude ( due to statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "@xcite show analytically and numerically that the jumps in the polarization direction should be random , sharp and accompanied by jumps in the amount of polarization .",
    "orphan afterglows arise as a natural prediction of grb jets .",
    "the realization that grbs are collimated with rather narrow opening angles , while the following afterglow could be observed over a wider angular range , led immediately to the search for orphan afterglows : afterglows which are not associated with observed prompt grb emission . while the grb and the early afterglow are collimated to within the original opening angle , @xmath712 ,",
    "the afterglow can be observed , after the jet break , from a viewing angle of @xmath750 .",

    "this means that an observer at @xmath751 could nt see the burst but could detect an afterglow once @xmath752 . as the typical emission frequency and the flux decrease with time , while the jet opening angle @xmath138 increases , this implies that observers at larger viewing angles will detect weaker and softer afterglows .",
    "orphan afterglows can be observed several hours or at most a few days after the burst ( depending of course on the sensitivity of the detector ) .",
    "optical afterglows ( brighter than 25th mag ) can be detected in r band for a week from small ( @xmath753 ) angles away from the grb jet axis .",
    "on the other hand , at very late times , after the newtonian break , radio afterglows could be detected by observers at all viewing angles .",

    "first , while in the collapsar model one expect a supernova bump on the afterglow light curve , such a bump is not expected in the supranova model unless the time delay is a few days . on the other hand while it is not clear in the collapsar model how does the fe needed for the fe lines reach the implied large distances form the center , it is obvious in this model , as the supernova shell was ejected to space several month before the grb .",
    "as mentioned earlier ( see  [ sec : obs - sn ] ) the association of grb 030329 with sn 2003dh @xcite is incompatible with the supranova model .",
    "proponents of this model , argue however , that there might be a distribution of delay times between the first and second collapses .",
    "the models are also very different in their physical content .",
    "first in the supranova model the grb jet does not have to punch a whole through the stellar envelope . instead the ejecta propagates in almost free space polluted possibly by a pulsar wind @xcite . in both models , like in many other models ,",
    "the grb is powered by accretion of a massive accretion disk surrounding the newborn black hole .",
    "this accretion disk forms , from the debris of the collapsing neutron star at the same time that the black hole is formed .",
    "again , the time scale of the burst is determined by the accretion time of this disk .",
    "@xcite ( see also  [ sec : accretion ] ) point however that long lived ( 50 sec ) accretion disks must be large and hence extremely inefficient .",
    "this may pose a problem for this model .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite considered the effects a strong pulsar wind ( that may exist after the sn and before the second collapse ) on this scenario .",
    "the pulsar wind can have several effects .",
    "first it would produce a denser highly magnetized medium into which the grb jet propagates .",
    "the strong magnetic field will be amplified by the afterglow shock .",
    "this resolves the problem of the source of the strong magnetic field needed for the synchrotron afterglow model .",
    "this can also explain the high energy emission detected by egret in grb 940217 ( @xcite and  [ sec : spec - obs ] ) by inverse compton scattering on the pulsar wind bubble photons .",
    "on the other hand the density of this wind matter ( @xmath913@xmath914 ) might be too high for the spherical model .",
    "note however , that this depends on the time delay as @xmath915 .",
    "however , the pulsar wind wo nt be spherical and one would expect that it will form an elongated supernova shell cavity within which the pulsar wind is bounded . if , as expected , the pulsar jet coincides with the grb jet then the relativistic ejecta will move along the elongated direction of this shell .",
    "neutron star binary mergers @xcite or neutron star - black hole binary mergers @xcite ( hereafter called mergers ) also produce a black hole - accretion disk system and are candidates for the inner engines of grbs , specifically of short grbs .",
    "these mergers take place because of the decay of the binary orbits due to gravitational radiation emission as was beautifully demonstrated in the famous binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "these mergers take place at a rate of @xmath916 events per year per galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is the rate of merger of binaries of the type of psr 1913 + 16 whose life time is or order of several @xmath244 years .",
    "various population synthesis calculations suggest that there is also another population of short lived binaries @xcite .",
    "these binaries form with very close orbits and hence with short lifetimes of the order of @xmath850yrs .",
    "even thought the overall rate of such mergers could be comparable to those of the psr 1913 + 16 type one can not expect to catch a binary in our galaxy in such a stage .",
    "similarly unlike the long lived mergers that may be kicked from their host galaxy within their long life time @xcite this short lived population remains within the galaxy when they merge @xcite .",
    "earlier simulations of mergers focused on the gravitational radiation from this system .",
    "@xcite begun a series of numerical simulation of neutron star merger that focused on grb related aspects @xcite . using a sph scheme they followed ns mergers under different assumptions ( newtonian with ad hoc addition of gravitational radiation back reaction or post newtonian ) , with different equations of state ( adiabatic or realistic ) and with different initial spin axis and mass rations and different estimates of the effects of neutrino cooling .",
    "a parallel set of simulations was carried out by @xcite who used particle in cell methods .",
    "both kinds of simulations yield comparable results .",
    "the merger results in a black hole - accretion disk system .",
    "the mass of the accretion disk is of order 0.1@xmath907 and it depends , of course somewhat on the orientation of the spins and the relative masses of the two neutron stars .",
    "a merger releases @xmath917ergs but most of this energy is in the form of low energy neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "still there is enough energy available to power a grb but is not clear how the grb is produced .",
    "a central question is , of course , how does a merger generate the relativistic wind required to power a grb .",
    "@xcite suggested that about one thousandth of these neutrinos annihilate and produce pairs that in turn produce gamma - rays via @xmath918 .",
    "this idea was criticized on several grounds by different authors the main problem is that it does not produce enough energy .",
    "for example @xcite pointed out that a large fraction of the neutrinos will be swallowed by the black hole that forms .",
    "an alternative source of energy within the merger model is the accretion power of a disk that forms around the black hole .",
    "this brings us back to the canonical black hole - accretion disk scenario .",
    "i believe that overall we have a basic understanding of the grb phenomenon . as usual",
    "some aspects are understood better than others .",
    "there is a very good understanding of the afterglow .",
    "here there are numerous observations over a wide range of wavelengths with which the theory can be confronted .",
    "the overall picture , of a slowing down relativistic flow and of synchrotron emission fit the data to a large extent ( see e.g. @xcite and many other fits of the observations to the model ) . we have already learned that the  cow is not spherical \" , namely that the relativistic flow is collimated .",
    "new observations , like those of grb 021004 and grb 030329 , poses at times new puzzles and suggest that the basic simple picture has to be refined .",
    "it seems however , that the answers are within the scope of the current model , such as : refreshed shocks , patchy shells and variable external densities .",
    "all these phenomena are fairly reasonable in a realistic environment . within the afterglow ,",
    "i believe that the lines pose the greatest current puzzle , in terms of their energy requirements and other implications on the source ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting open question is what distinguished between ghosts and otgrbs - an environmental ( extinction or ",
    "improper conditions within the circum - burst matter ) or an intrinsic mechanism ?",
    "the main observational challenges concerning the afterglow are the determination whether short grbs have afterglow .",
    "a wealth of information on long grbs arises from the information on hosts , environments and redshifts , that are determined from the afterglow observations .",
    "all these are missing for short grbs .",
    "if short grbs do nt have afterglows , then an immediate theoretical question is why ?",
    "is it possible that they are produced in a very different environment than long ones ( such as outside their original galaxies ) in a region with no circum - burst matter suitable for producing the afterglow ? at the moment the observational situation is not clear . the coming swift satellite may resolve this mystery .",
    "another important observational question involves the search for orphan afterglows ( either in radio or in optical ) .",
    "their detection will establish the collimated jets picture .",
    "but even firm upper limits will set independent limits on the rates of grbs .",
    "however , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : orphan ] this is a very challenging observational task .",
    "this has important implication for the nature of the jets - are grb jets standard with a fixed angular structure @xcite ? this question is related both to the overall energetics and to the rate of grbs .",
    "another interesting challenge will be the resolution of the afterglow image ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this may be possible in radio for a nearby burst and the afterglow of grb 030329 provides an excellent candidate for that .",
    "polarization measures could pave the way for understanding of the collimation geometry and for a confirmation of the synchrotron emission process .    as we move backwards with time towards the burst we encounter the very early afterglow and the optical flash that coincides with the burst itself .",
    "here a great progress was made with recent observations triggered by hete ii ( e.g. the almost complete light curve of grb 021004 @xcite ) .",
    "swift may contribute a lot to this issue .",
    "these observations could shed a light on issues like the role of pre - acceleration and neutrons that are unclear as yet .",
    "here , i stress the importance of early and continuous radio observations , which could determine whether there are refreshed shocks during the early afterglow , that have a clear radio signature @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the emitting regions is less clear . here ,",
    "within the internal shocks model there is a reasonable understanding of the temporal structure ( in terms of activity of the inner engine ) .",
    "however , it is not clear how is the observed spectrum produces and it seems that the simple synchrotron spectrum has to be modified ( see e.g. @xcite for ideas on such modifications ) .",
    "another possibly related puzzle is the origin of the narrow @xmath17 distributions ( see however , e.g. @xcite ) . another set of open questions is what is the origin of the intrinsic correlation between luminosity ( which in fact reflects the collimation angle @xcite ) discovered by @xcite or the lag - luminosity relation discovered by @xcite . similarly or even more puzzling are the implied correlations between redshift and intrinsic luminosity @xcite and between redshift and intrinsic hardness @xcite ( note that this later correlation is essential in view of the narrow @xmath17 distribution of grbs ) . here",
    "pairs @xcite and ic can play an important role .",
    "theoretical open basic physical questions that arise here ( as well as in the theory of the afterglow ) deal with the processes of the behavior of collisionless shocks ( see e.g. @xcite , particle acceleration ( see  [ sec : acc ] ) and the generation of strong magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "issues like relativistic turbulence and relativistic plasma instabilities might play an important role here ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "> from an observational point , it will be a challenge to beat the statistical power of the batse data in terms of number of bursts . somewhat surprisingly , the questions what is the luminosity function of grbs and what is the rate of grbs as a function of redshift and to what extend grbs follow the star formation rate are still open . detectors with better spectral resolutions could shed some additional light on the spectrum .",
    "another hope for new data , or at least for upper limits , arises from observational windows in higher bands . on the low energy side it seems that there is a continuum between xrfs and grbs @xcite",
    "this result still has to be fully understood in the context of the narrow @xmath17 distribution .",
    "looking far into the future one can hope to observe neutrinos or gravitational radiation correlated to grbs .",
    "uhe neutrinos ( fluxes of mev neutrinos would be too weak to be detected from cosmological distances ) could confirm that protons are accelerated to uhe energies within grbs . in turn this would proof ( or disprove ) the possible role of grbs as sources of uhecrs .",
    "gravitational radiation could give a direct clue on the activity of the inner engine ( see  [ sec : grgrb ] and identify , for example , merger events .",
    "there is a lot of observational evidence associating long grbs with core collapse snes .",
    "this gives a clear clue on what is the inner engine of long grbs .",
    "there is no direct or indirect evidence on the progenitors of short grbs .",
    "even with this clue the situation is far from clear when we turn to the inner engine . here",
    "most models assume some variant of a black - hole - torus system with various energy extraction mechanisms ranging from neutrino annihilation ( which is less likely ) to variants on the theme of electromagnetic extraction ( magnetic turbulence within the accretion disk ; the blandford - znajek mechanism which involves a disk - black hole - magnetic field interaction ; pulsar like activity ) . here",
    "there are open questions all around : what is the content of the ultrarelativistic flow - baryonic or poynting flux ?",
    "how is the flow accelerated and collimated ? what determines the variability of the flow ( required for internal shocks ) and the different time scales ?",
    "this part of the model seems to be in a rather poor shape - but this is understandable as we do nt have any direct observations of this inner engine .",
    "one hope that arises is that there seem to be an emerging similarity between grbs , galactic micro quasars and agns .",
    "all these systems accelerate collimated flows to relativistic velocities and they all seem to involve accretion onto black holes . hopefully , this similarity could lead to a common resolution of how inner engines operate in all those systems .",
