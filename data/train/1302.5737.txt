    "with the recent observed higgs boson candidate at the lhc , the weak sector of the standard model may be approaching closure .",
    "however the strong interaction component is far from complete , especially hadronic structure where intense searches are under way for unconventional ( non @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) states .",
    "indeed qcd allows for other color singlet combinations , such as glueballs , hybrid mesons , tetraquarks , pentaquarks and dibaryons . as early as 1977 @xmath21 tetraquark states",
    "were proposed @xcite and today there are now good candidates , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , listed in the pdg meson summary table @xcite .",
    "these states have unconventional quantum numbers @xmath24 which are not possible for a @xmath19 system and have been reasonably described @xcite as @xmath25 color singlet - singlet states referred to as molecules . in the heavy quark sector",
    "no states with unconventional quantum numbers have yet to be confirmed . however , there are hidden charm states , some also listed in the pdg summary , which can not be described as @xmath26 mesons .",
    "these @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath27 particles are charmonium - like but are not consistent with any @xmath26 spectrum predictions .",
    "the lightest is @xmath7 which was discovered by belle in 2003 @xcite and has a narrow peak near 3872 @xmath28 in the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution from @xmath30 decay .",
    "this discovery was confirmed by babar in the same decay process @xcite .",
    "subsequently , additional @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath27 resonances were found , most recently @xcite the first charged charmonium - like structure @xmath14 which requires at least four quarks to have a non - zero electric charge .",
    "states with confirmed @xmath2 are listed in table [ table : xyz ] .",
    ".properties of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath27 mesons with established @xmath2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculated all possible states with @xmath31 and/or @xmath32 and the numerical results for corresponding @xmath2 are listed in table [ table : data ] . for model completeness and further comparative insight",
    ", we also list our @xmath33 hybrid predictions from an earlier publication @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the diquark composition is heavier than the corresponding molecular state .",
    "even more significant is the sensitivity to arrangement of flavor as @xmath3 states are much lighter than @xmath4 for the same @xmath34 , @xmath35 configuration .",
    "the cg model therefore predicts that the lightest tetraquark states are molecules having quarks with the same flavor in a color singlet ( e.g. a @xmath36 or @xmath37 type flavor structure depending upon spin ) .    for the @xmath38 wave triplet - triplet tetraquark states ,",
    "the mass changes little with different spin .",
    "this is because there is a heavy charm quark in each color triplet and the spin splitting decreases with heavier quark mass . for orbit angular momentum 1 ,",
    "the triplet - triplet tetraquark mass increases about 300 to 400 @xmath28 and all @xmath39 wave tetraquarks have mass above 4400 @xmath28 .",
    "similarly for the @xmath0 states , the spin splitting is very small due to the large charm quark mass in each color singlet , and again if either @xmath40 or @xmath41 changes from 0 to 1 the mass increases , now about 430 @xmath28 . for the @xmath42 flavor arrangement ,",
    "the mass does not depend on the @xmath26 spin but increases about 240 @xmath28 if the spin of light quark subgroup changes from 0 to 1 .",
    "the mass increase due to larger orbit angular momentum is also flavor sensitive , since for @xmath43 @xmath39 waves it is about 650 @xmath28 , while for @xmath26 @xmath39 waves it is 490 @xmath28 .",
    "and @xmath6 tetraquark states compared to data ( solid lines).,width=325 ]    in fig .",
    "[ pic : data ] , we compare predicted @xmath5 and @xmath6 tetraquark masses to observed @xmath15 and @xmath16 states . only about half of the states",
    "have established @xmath2 and to aid determining quantum numbers it is noteworthy that the observed @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are comparable to the heaviest model @xmath5 states .",
    "if this identification proves correct , then the model predicts the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are molecular states consisting of either one or two spin 1 clusters having a @xmath12 flavor composition while the @xmath46 and @xmath47 would be exotic triplet - triplet states with a diquark composition .",
    "regarding the established @xmath2 states , the predicted @xmath42 @xmath5 mass is 3783 @xmath28 , about @xmath48 less than observed , suggesting the @xmath7 may be a molecular state with a @xmath9 flavor composition . since the annihilation mass contribution , eq .",
    "( [ annih ] ) , does not contribute in a @xmath19 color singlet or isospin 1 configuration , our model also predicts a degenerate isovector @xmath5 state , now having a @xmath49 molecular type structure , with mass near the recently observed @xcite charged @xmath14 .",
    "four @xmath6 tetraquark states are predicted with the lightest mass at 4026 @xmath28 which is close to @xmath8 discovered by belle @xcite .",
    "the masses of the next two heavier molecular states are 4129 and 4186 , which are comparable with the unknown @xmath2 @xmath44 and @xmath50 .",
    "the states with masses 4026 @xmath28 and 4186 @xmath28 have @xmath10 and @xmath51 type structures , respectively , while the state at 4129 @xmath28 is a @xmath52 type molecule . because the @xmath50 decays to @xmath53 rather than @xmath52 , it is tempting to identify it with the model @xmath54",
    "especially if the @xmath44 has @xmath55 , in contrast to @xmath5 discussed above . if so a mixing analysis may be necessary since these two model states are close in mass .",
    "the calculated mass of the triplet - triplet @xmath6 state is 4741 @xmath28 which is also near to the @xmath56 mass .",
    "this state would be an exotic diquark if this assignment prevails .",
    "lastly , for the observed @xmath57 @xmath58 listed in table [ table : xyz ] , the model tetraquark states are either above or below this mass by over 150 @xmath28 , however the predicted @xmath33 hybrid mass of 3965 @xmath28 ( see table [ table : data ] ) agrees quite well .",
    "similarly the @xmath59 hybrid at 3945 @xmath28 is very close to the @xmath60 .",
    "this state does not have established quantum numbers other than the @xmath61 parity which is also the same as our hybrid prediction .",
    "the hybrid results are quite firm since they include both hyperfine and the non - linear ( non - abelian ) component of the color magnetic fields ( eq . ( 7 ) ) .    finally , it is interesting that the decay channels summarized in table 1 are consistent with the coulomb gauge model flavor structure predictions for those observed states .",
    "specifically , for the predicted molecular state assignments involving the @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath8 and @xmath50 having a non @xmath52 or @xmath11 flavor structure , their decays would favor the observed @xmath53 over channels with @xmath62 mesons .",
    "related , the relative values of the @xmath63 widths , small , 1.2 @xmath28 , for the @xmath7 and over an order of magnitude larger , 46 @xmath28 @xcite , for the @xmath14 , are consistent with a @xmath5 assignment since 2@xmath64 decay is isospin violating for @xmath65 = 0 but allowed for @xmath66 . for the diquark model states , detailed decay calculations",
    "would be necessary to make firm predictions .",
    "similarly , for the undetermined @xmath2 states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , knowing their decays would be a helpful identifying signature .",
    "we have applied the coulomb gauge model to tetraquark systems with hidden charm having two different color compositions , singlet - singlet and triplet - triplet . generally , triplet - triplet states are the heaviest for the same spin or orbit angular momentum",
    ". for color singlet - singlet states , we further investigated the flavor groupings corresponding to @xmath67 versus @xmath68 type molecules ( meson - meson states ) and found that the same flavor color singlets produce a lower mass . also , the mass from the spin part decreases rapidly with increasing quark mass , while the orbit angular momentum contribution decreases slowly with increasing quark mass .",
    "our key finding is the @xmath7 mass is close to the predicted @xmath5 @xmath42 state suggesting it is a conventional @xmath37 type molecule and not a more exotic diquark tetraquark state .",
    "four @xmath6 states are predicted , three molecular and one triplet - triplet .",
    "their masses are comparable with @xmath8 , @xmath50 , @xmath69 and @xmath56 .",
    "the masses of other states with undetermined @xmath2 , most significantly the charged @xmath14 , are close to the calculated @xmath5 results .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 number of these states could be @xmath5 .",
    "future work will address several issues .",
    "the spin dependence will be further studied now including the hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "also , a dynamic mixing analysis will be performed involving @xmath70 and @xmath71 states having various flavor distributions as well as mixing with glueball and hybrid meson exotic states .",
    "finally , the cg model will be applied to @xmath72 quark systems to aid experimental searched at higher energies .",
