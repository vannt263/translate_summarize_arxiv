    "in 1911 curiosity concerning the electrical properties of metals at low temperatures led the dutch physicist , h. k. onnes and his assistant g. holst to discover superconductivity at 4.2 k in mercury @xcite .",
    "this discovery was one of the most important experimental findings in low temperature physics . since then tremendous theoretical and experimental efforts have been made with the aim of clarifying the microscopic mechanism responsible for this novel ground state .    on the long way towards a microscopic understanding of superconductivity , the observation of an isotope effect on @xmath4 in 1950 @xcite gave important clues to the understanding of the microscopic theory of superconductivity .",
    "the presence of an isotope effect thus implies that superconductivity is not of purely electronic origin . in the same year",
    "h. frhlich @xcite pointed out that the electron - phonon interaction gave rise to an indirect attractive interaction between electrons , which might be responsible for superconductivity .",
    "frhlich s theory played a decisive role in establishing the correct mechanism .",
    "later , in 1956 l. cooper @xcite discovered that electrons with an attractive interaction form bound pairs ( so called cooper pairs ) which lead to superconductivity .",
    "however , the existence of electron pairs does not necessarily imply a phonon mediated pairing .",
    "indeed , bose condensation as considered in 1955 by schafroth @xcite , is also a possible mechanism for superconductivity , but the model was not able to explain the existence of an isotope effect .",
    "finally , in 1957 , bardeen , cooper and schrieffer @xcite developed the bcs theory that was the first successful microscopic theory of superconductivity .",
    "it is remarkable that the bcs theory shows that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a typical phonon frequency ( e.g. , the debye frequency @xmath7 ) .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath8 is the product of an electron - phonon interaction constant @xmath9 and the electronic density of states at the fermi surface @xmath10 , both of which are assumed to be independent of the ion mass @xmath11 .",
    "this formula implies an isotope - mass dependence of @xmath3 , with an isotope - effect exponent @xmath12 = @xmath13 = 1/2 , in excellent agreement with the reported isotope effects in the non - transition metal superconductors ( e.g. , hg , sn and pb ) . on the other hand , many superconducting transition metals show a much smaller isotope effect ( e.g. zr , ru : @xmath14 ) , and in some materials even negative isotope shifts have been reported ( e.g. u : @xmath15 ) .",
    "the obvious discrepancy between the observed isotope effect and the prediction of the bcs theory demonstrates the limitations of the simplified bcs approach . nevertheless , the phonon mediated bcs theory was the basis for further and more sophisticated microscopic theories of superconductivity .    since the original bcs theory of 1957 there has been considerable progress toward a deeper understanding of the electron - phonon interaction . in the strong - coupling eliashberg model @xcite the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath16",
    "is related to the spectral function @xmath17 , as defined by the product of the frequency - dependent average electron - phonon interaction @xmath18 and phonon density of states @xmath19 .",
    "mcmillan @xcite numerically solved the eliashberg equations and found an expression for @xmath4 taking into account the coulomb repulsion between electrons and the retarded nature of the phonon - induced interaction @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an effective coulomb repulsion .",
    "the bcs result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc ] ) is recovered for @xmath22 , and in this weak - coupling limit @xmath23 substitutes the role of @xmath8 . as a consequence , in strong - coupling superconductors the isotope effect exponent @xmath12 is no longer a universal value and given by @xmath24^{2 } }      \\right ) ~.      \\label{eq : ismcmillan}\\ ] ]    within the framework of the eliashberg theory a small or even negative isotope exponent is possible .",
    "therefore , the observation of a small isotope exponent could still be consistent with the phonon - mediated pairing mechanism .",
    "since the discovery of superconductivity in la@xmath25ba@xmath26cuo@xmath27 by bednorz and mller in 1986 @xcite , tremendous efforts have been made to clarify the microscopic pairing mechanism for high - temeprature superconductivity . in some of the cuprates the critical temperatures are far beyond a supposed maximum @xmath28  k , estimated theoretically on the basis of the conventional phonon - mediated mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical estimate has not been well justified .",
    "contrary to low @xmath4 elemental superconductors , the cuprates have a complex crystal structure and consist of at least three constituents , leading to complicated phononic and electronic densities of states .",
    "the structure of cuprates may be described by the three main features : i ) the cuo@xmath29 planes , ii ) the apical oxygen , iii ) the metal - oxygen charge reservoir .",
    "all the high-@xmath4 superconductors have cuo@xmath29 planes , but the number of planes varies among the different families of cuprates , ranging from a single - layer up to an infinite - layer structure .",
    "the investigation of the isotope effect in cuprates is certainly much more difficult than in elemental superconductors . in compound superconductors , such as the cuprates ,",
    "it is convenient to define a partial isotope exponent for a constituent with mass @xmath30 as @xmath31 where the index @xmath32 denotes a constituent with mass @xmath30 ( e.g. oxygen )",
    ". the magnitude of @xmath33 may provide insight into which phonons are important in the occurrence of superconductivity . as discussed above",
    ", small or even vanishing partial isotope exponents do not necessarily imply that the corresponding constituent is not important for the occurrence of superconductivity . for a conclusive decision on the role of lattice vibrations in superconductivity",
    ", one should not only study the isotope effect on @xmath3 , but also the isotope effects on some other parameters such as the effective supercarrier mass @xmath34 and the supercarrier density @xmath35 .",
    "the latter effects may offer more information about the role of phonons , and will be crucial to the understanding of the physics of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "studies of isotope shifts of @xmath3 have been carried out in almost all known cuprates .",
    "a comprehensive review is given by franck @xcite .",
    "most of the studies reported so far concern the oxygen isotope shift by replacing @xmath36o with @xmath37o , partly because the experimental procedures are simple and reliable . today",
    "it is generally accepted that the cuprates doped for maximum @xmath4 exhibit a small but clearly non - vanishing @xmath38 .",
    "this is true for all the different families of doped cuprates .",
    "some of the results are listed in table .",

    "@xcite ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ois ]    although the different compounds exhibit quite different @xmath4 s , it is striking that the oxygen - isotope exponents ( oies ) are similar in magnitude and remain small .",
    "this suggests that the oie depends neither on @xmath4 nor on specific structural properties such as the number of cuo@xmath29 planes and the electronic properties of the metal - oxygen buffer layers .",
    "the small oie observed in the optimally doped cuprates suggest that phonons might not be important in high temperature superconductivity .",
    "this has led to many exotic non - phonon mediated pairing mechanisms ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , the doping dependence of the oie has been extensively studied in different cuprate systems @xcite for a particular family of doped cuprates the oie increases with decreasing @xmath4 , and can be even larger than the bcs prediction @xcite . such an anomalously large oie may imply that phonons play an important role in the occurrence of high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides .",
    "any correct theories for describing the physics of high-@xmath3 superconductors must consistently explain both the small oie in the optimally - doped samples , and the anomalously large oie in the underdoped samples .",
    "the non - vanishing oies indicate that the oxygen - dominated phonon modes are involved in the occurrence of superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "as we will see below , there are strong coupling features to multiple phonon modes in tunneling and angle - resolved photoemission spectra .",
    "this implies that there should be isotope shifts related to other atoms .",
    "indeed , large copper - isotope shifts , with @xmath39 being close to @xmath38 , have been observed in underdoped la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath27 ( lsco ) @xcite and in oxygen - depleted yba@xmath40cu@xmath41o@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this implies that cu - dominated phonon modes also play important role in the pairing .",
    "the conventional phonon - mediated superconducting theory is based on the migdal adiabatic approximation in which the phonon - induced electron self - energy is given correctly to order @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 10@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass of an electron . within this approximation ,",
    "the density of states at the fermi level @xmath10 , the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath16 , and the effective mass of the supercarriers are all independent of the ion - mass @xmath11 . this approximation has been working very well in conventional elemental superconductors because the ratio of the sound velocity is much smaller than the fermi velocity .",
    "however , since the phase velocity of long wave - length optical phonons is large compared to the fermi velocity , it may break down in some compounds with reasonably strong electron - phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "the break - down of the migdal approximation may lead to the formation of polarons@xmath47new quasi - particles moved together with local lattice distortions .",
    "the effective mass of polarons @xmath34 will depend on @xmath11 .",
    "this is because the polaron mass @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the band mass in the absence of the electron - phonon interaction , @xmath49 is a constant , and @xmath6 is a characteristic phonon frequency which depends on the masses of ions . hence , there should be a large isotope effect on the polaronic carrier mass , in contrast to the zero isotope effect on the effective carrier mass in ordinary metals . due to the polaronic band",
    "narrow effect , the effective density of states at the fermi level @xmath10 and the effective electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath16 [ proportional to @xmath10 ] should also depend on the ion mass @xmath11 .",
    "this will lead to more complicated isotope effect on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , negative , vanishing , or small isotope exponents @xmath51 in optimally doped cuprates do not necessarily imply that phonons are not important for the pairing mechanism if polarons are bound into the cooper pairs .",
    "the total exponent of the isotope effect on the effective carrier mass is defined as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the mass of the @xmath32th atom in a unit cell ) . for polaronic carriers @xmath48",
    ", this definition leads to @xmath54    it is interesting that the simple relation @xmath48 is even valid in the weak coupling region in the case of the long - range frhlich electron - phonon interaction @xcite",
    ". then the polaron mass enhancement factor @xmath55 in this case is simply equal to @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , if electron - phonon coupling in a solid is strong enough to form polarons and/or bipolarons , one should expect a substantial isotope effect on the effective mass of carriers .",
    "an important and essential proof for the existence of polarons and/or bipolarons in cuprates is provided by the observation of the substantial oxygen - isotope effect on the penetration depth @xcite .",
    "_ made the first observation of this effect in optimally doped yba@xmath40cu@xmath41o@xmath57 in 1995 @xcite . by precisely measuring the diamagnetic signals near @xmath3 for the @xmath36o and @xmath37o samples , the authors were able to deduce the oxygen - isotope effect on the penetration depth @xmath58 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath59 = 3.2 @xmath60 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for highly anisotropic materials , the observed isotope effect on the angle - averaged @xmath58 is the same as the isotope effect on the in - plane penetration depth @xmath61 . from the magnetic data for yba@xmath40cu@xmath41o@xmath57 , la@xmath62sr@xmath63cuo@xmath64 , and bi@xmath65pb@xmath66sr@xmath40ca@xmath40cu@xmath41o@xmath67 , one finds that @xmath68 = 3.2@xmath690.7@xmath60 for the three optimally doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "several independent experiments have consistently shown that the carrier densities of the two isotope samples are the same within 0.0004 per unit cell @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed oxygen - isotope effect on the in - plane penetration depth is caused only by the isotope dependence of the in - plane supercarrier mass .",
    "recently , direct measurements of the in - plane penetration depth by low energy muon - spin - relaxation ( le@xmath70sr ) technique @xcite have confirmed the earlier isotope - effect results . it is found that @xcite @xmath68 = 2.8@xmath691.0@xmath60 .",
    "it is remarkable that the isotope effect obtained from the most advanced and expensive technology ( le@xmath70sr ) is the same as that deduced from simple magnetic measurements .     of the oxygen - isotope effect on the in - plane supercarrier mass in la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath64 .",

    "the exponent is defined as @xmath71 .",
    "it is apparent that the exponent increases with decreasing doping , in agreement with the fact that doping reduces electron - phonon coupling due to screening of charge carriers .",
    "the large oxygen - isotope effect on the in - plane supercarrier mass can not be explained within the conventional phonon - mediated pairing mechanism where the effective mass of supercarriers is independent of the isotope mass @xcite . in particular , the substantial oxygen - isotope effect on @xmath73 in optimally doped cuprates indicates that the polaronic effect is not vanished in the optimal doping regime where the bcs - like superconducting transition occurs .",
    "this suggests that polaronic carriers may be bound into the cooper pairs in optimally doped and overdoped cuprates .",
    "this scenario @xcite can naturally explain a small isotope effect on @xmath3 in optimally doped cuprates .",
    "the observed substantial oxygen - isotope effect on the effective supercarrier mass suggests that doped holes are strongly coupled with phonons to form polarons and/or bipolarons .",
    "it is natural that undoped parent compounds like la@xmath40cuo@xmath64 should have stronger electron - phonon interactions because no doped charge carriers can screen the electron - phonon interactions .",
    "very strong electron - phonon interactions can reduce electron hopping integral @xmath74 through the polaronic effect @xcite , which may lead to the renormalization of magnetic exchange energy .",
    "then one might expect that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange energy in antiferromagnetic cuprates and the ferromagnetic exchange energy in ferromagnetic manganites should depend on the isotope mass if both systems have very strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "following this simple argument , zhao and his co - workers initiated studies of the oxygen - isotope effect on the af ordering temperature @xmath75 in several parent cuprates @xcite and the oxygen - isotope effect on the curie temperature in ferromagnetic managnites @xcite .",
    "a small oxygen - isotope shift of @xmath75 was consistently observed in la@xmath40cuo@xmath64 @xcite while a giant oxygen - isotope shift of the curie temperature was observed in doped manganites @xcite .",
    "the large difference in the isotope effects on the magnetic ordering temperatures appears contradictory since both materials should have similar electron - phonon coupling strengths . here",
    "we will show that the small isotope shift of @xmath75 is also consistent with a large polaron binding energy due to the fact that the electron - phonon interaction renormalizes the antiferromagnetic exchange energy @xmath0 through the forth order process @xcite .    from the oxygen - isotope shift of @xmath75 , one can determine the oxygen - isotope effect on the antiferromagnetic exchange energy @xmath0 , that is , @xmath76 @xmath77 ( ref .",

    "what is striking is that doped holes via oxygen doping in the cuo chains are almost equally distributed to the apical and in - plane oxygen orbitals @xcite . the ca substitution for y yields hole doping into the in - plane oxygen orbitals only and no superconductivity is seen in a compound with 10@xmath60 in - plane oxygen holes and negligible apical oxygen holes .",
    "this remarkable experiment clearly demonstrates that the apical oxygen holes are crucial to high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the data provide strong support for the theory of bipolaronic superconductivity proposed by alexandrov and mott @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on mobile intersite bipolarons that are formed between apical and in - plane oxygen holes .",
    "different types of bipolarons in la@xmath40cuo@xmath64 were investigated by catlow _",
    "@xcite with computer simulation techniques based on the minimization of the ground - state energy without the hopping term .",
    "an intersite bipolaron formed between an in - plane and an apical oxygen - hole polaron ( denoted by ap bipolaron ) was found energetically favorable with the binding energy of 0.14 ev .",
    "an intersite bipolaron formed between two in - plane oxygen hole polarons ( denoted by pp bipolaron ) is also possible but with a much smaller binding energy ( 0.06 ev ) .",
    "both electron - phonon interactions and bipolaron binding energies will decrease when the hoping term is turned on .",
    "doping will further reduce the bipolaron binding energy due to the screening of charge carriers .",
    "therefore , it is possible that only ap bipolarons are stable in doped cuprates . for ybco , about half of the inplane oxygen holes will be combined with the apical oxygen holes to form intersite bipolarons while the remaining in - plane oxygen holes are mixed with in - plane cu holes and may be bound into @xmath119-space pairs below @xmath3 . for lsco , the number of the apical oxygen holes might be quite close to that of the in - plane oxygen holes since there are two apical and two in - plane oxygen atoms per formula unit .    an important proof for this simple model is provided by the data of the normal - state susceptibility @xmath120 ( ref .",
    "the temperature dependence of the normal - state susceptibility in cuprates is very different from conventional metals .",
    "it was found @xcite that @xmath120 exhibits a broad peak at a temperature @xmath121 .",
    "such behavior was interpreted in terms of the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic correlation among cu spins .",
    "however , nakano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that , at low temperatures , @xmath120 strongly deviates from the prediction of the 2d af model .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of @xmath120 is proportional to the electronic specific heat @xcite , implying that the @xmath120 reflects the density of states of the conduction electrons rather than the localized spin correlation .",
    "alternatively , alexandrov , kabanov and mott ( akm ) explained the normal - state susceptibility data on the basis of their small ( bi)polaron theory @xcite which predicts a temperature - dependent spin susceptibility : @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the bipolaron binding energy and @xmath124 is a constant depending on the effective masses of polarons and bipolarons @xcite .",
    "if we consider possible coexistence with in - plane oxygen - hole polaron fermi - liquid , the total susceptibility for the two - component system [ ap ( bi)polarons + in - plane oxygen - hole polarons ] is @xmath120 = @xmath125 + @xmath126 + @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is the fraction of the ap ( bi)polarons , @xmath129 is the susceptibility contributed from the fermi - liquid - like polarons , and @xmath127 is the total orbital contribution",

    "@xcite , one sees that for @xmath132 @xmath134 0.10 , only ( bi)polaronic charge carriers exist , and that the fraction of the fermi - liquid carriers increases monotonically with @xmath132 for @xmath132 @xmath92 0.10 . therefore , the theory of bipolaronic superconductivity should be applied for @xmath132 @xmath134 0.10 . for @xmath132",
    "@xmath92 0.1 , it is possible that , due to a decrease of the charge - transfer gap , more in - plane cu holes are introduced so that the component of the fermi - liquid - like carriers increases substantially . in the overdoped region ( e.g. , @xmath132 = 0.2 ) , the majority of the carriers are polarons at @xmath3 , so superconductivity should arise from @xmath119-space pairing of fermi - liquid - like polarons .",

    "@xcite ) , which is much smaller than the predicted value of about 2.9 ev ( ref .",
    "therefore , the apparent connection between the two hole pockets may arise from the band - tailing phenomenon in doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "an unambiguous determination of the pairing symmetry in cuprates is crucial to the understanding of the pairing mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "many experiments have been designed to test the pairing symmetry in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , contradictory conclusions have been drawn from different experimental techniques @xcite , which can be classified into being bulk - sensitive and surface - sensitive .",
    "for example , the magnetic penetration depth measurements and polarized raman scattering experiments are bulk - sensitive .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in general a surface - sensitive technique .",
    "however , the arpes data for bi@xmath40sr@xmath40cacu@xmath40o@xmath138 should nearly reflect the bulk properties since the cleaved top surface contains an inactive bi - o layer , and the superconducting coherent length along the @xmath139-axis is very short .",
    "the single - particle tunneling experiments along the cuo@xmath40 planes can probe the bulk electronic density of states since the mean free path is far larger than the thickness of the degraded surface layer @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the phase - sensitive experiments based on the planar josephson tunneling are rather surface sensitive , so that they might not probe the intrinsic bulk superconducting state if the surfaces are strongly degraded .",
    "therefore , the surface- and phase - sensitive experiments do not necessarily provide an acid test for the intrinsic bulk gap symmetry .",
    "zhao @xcite has identified the intrinsic bulk pairing symmetry for hole - doped cuprates from the existing bulk- and nearly bulk - sensitive experimental results such as arpes , magnetic penetration depth , single - particle tunneling spectra , and nonlinear meissner effect .",
    "these experimental results consistently show that the dominant pairing symmetry in hole - doped cuprates is an extended s - wave with eight line nodes , that is @xmath140 , where the @xmath141 component @xmath142 is larger than the @xmath1-wave component @xmath143 , and @xmath144 is measured from the cu - o bonding direction .",
    "zhao @xcite has also studied the intrinsic pairing symmetry for optimally electron - doped cuprates from bulk - sensitive data of raman scattering , optical conductivity , magnetic penetration depth , directional point - contact tunneling spectra , and nonmagnetic pair - breaking effect .",
    "he has shown that all these bulk - sensitive data are in quantitative agreement with a nearly isotropic @xmath1-wave gap .",
