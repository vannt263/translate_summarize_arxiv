    "this is a particularly interesting direction allowing e.g. for studies of spin liquids @xcite with optical quantum simulators .",
    "while advanced numerical techniques , such as tensor networks , have been developed for spin hamiltonians @xcite , the use of similarly efficient techniques for quantum optical systems , where a system of spins is coupled to the bosonic modes of an electromagnetic field remains limited . in this work we use mean - field ( mf ) description , exact diagonalization and large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm to study arrays of waveguide cavities ( we note that in the context of cavity qed , qmc was implemented to study both the jaynes - cummings - hubbard @xcite and the rabi - hubbard @xcite models ) .",
    "this gives us rigorous tools to investigate the emergence of the effective spin physics as a limiting case of the parent jc hamiltonian for arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions .",
    "specifically , in this work we focus on square lattice geometry and we study the ground state properties of the jc and the effective spin models for various parameter regimes .",

    "schematically , the parameter regime of the spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) is summarized in fig .",

    "this is apparent from the form of the interaction which tends to align each pair of spins antiparallel whenever the corresponding coupling is positive .",
    "this then leads to frustration as the antiparallel alignment can not be satisfied simultaneously for all the spins .",
    "note that while we consider square lattice for concreteness , the presence of frustration in cavity arrays stems from all - to - all interaction between spins belonging to the same cavity mode and , hence , is independent of the lattice geometry .",
    "next , we discuss the parameter regimes of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) .",
    "we recall that the only requirement used in the derivation of ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) from the parent jc hamiltonian ( [ eq : h jc ] ) is the condition ( [ eq : cond elimination ] ) , @xmath36 .    _",

    "] one should verify that reaching the weakly interacting regime is compatible with the conditions ( [ eq : cond omega g ] ) , ( [ eq : cond elimination ] ) used in the derivation of the hamiltonians ( [ eq : h jc ] ) , ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that it is indeed the case : substituting ( [ eq : pars spin main ] ) for @xmath4 in ( [ eq : cond 3 main ] ) , we get @xmath40 .",
    "this implies , together with ( [ eq : cond elimination ] ) , that @xmath41 . finally , substituting for @xmath42 from ( [ eq : pars h jc g ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath43 .",
    "this is enforced by the stronger condition ( [ eq : cond omega g ] ) , which completes our consistency check .    _",
    "( ii ) strongly interacting regime . _",

    "we leave this interesting possibility for sec . [",
    "sec : frustration ] and focus first on the scenario where the dynamics of the cavity fields decouples from the spins leading to a pure spin hamiltonian .",
    "it is illustrative to clarify on a simple example some of the basic properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) . specifically , we are interested in the nature of phase transitions featured by ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) and the scalings of critical couplings . to this end",
    "we consider a one dimensional limit of ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) by taking a single cavity mode @xmath45 .",

    "the situation is summarized in table [ tab : transitions ] . the main message contained in the table [ tab : transitions ]",
    "is that it is _ not _ possible to simulate the frustrated spin system using ( [ eq : h jc ] ) in one dimension ( see also @xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : frustration ] we will show , how this limitation can be circumvented in two dimensions by exploiting the properties of the @xmath34 term ( [ eq : delta omega spin ] ) .    in what follows we shall investigate this transition and its relation to the parent jc hamiltonian ( [ eq : h jc ] ) further .",

    "the only non - trivial situation is thus the non - frustrated case , @xmath5 , where @xmath71 . here",
    ", a series of transitions between phases with @xmath72 and @xmath73 excited spins takes place as @xmath7 is increased ( here @xmath74 ) .",

    "we start by determining the critical value of @xmath90 at which a transition from 0- to 1-excitation sector occurs in the spin model .",
    "this can be simply obtained from the condition @xmath91 and with the help of ( [ eq : egs spin ] ) we get _ a , c^spin = - .",
    "next , the breakdown of the effective model is indicated when _ any _ of the photonic eigenvalues ( [ eq : eigs ph ] ) becomes negative , corresponding to infinitely many photons in the ground state .",

    "the criterion of having a valid and non - trivial regime in the effective spin hamiltonian ( i.e. finite number of photons and non - zero spin excitations ) thus translates into r > 1 q 1 [ eq : cond breakdown ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : breakdown ] we plot the contours of constant @xmath98 ( left pane ) and @xmath99 ( right pane ) respectively in the @xmath100@xmath101 plane .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that increasing both @xmath102 and @xmath103 leads to a larger critical ratio @xmath98 , i.e. we can ensure the presence of the non - trivial region by tuning these parameters .",

    "parameters used : @xmath109.,width=491 ]    so far we have concetrated only on the simple 0 and 1-excitation sectors of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "clearly , for the interactions to become relevant one is interested in sectors with larger number of excitations . to this end",
    "one could extend the above analysis to the @xmath110 particle transitions for @xmath111 and for each of the transitions evaluate the critical ratio @xmath98 .",
    "the fully analytical approach is unfortunatelly obscured by the fact that for particle sectors @xmath112 , the spin interaction matrix ( [ eq : h spin int ] ) does not take the simple structure of ( [ eq : h1p ] ) and the evaluation of eigenvalues thus amounts to solving higher order polynomials which in general requires a numerical approach .",
    "however , the arbitrarily large values of @xmath98 for the @xmath113 spin excitation transition are suggestive and it is likely that also higher excitation number sectors can be reached without breaking the validity of the spin hamiltonian .    to recap , we have shown that the spin model ( [ eq : h spin main ] ) with both frustrated and non - frustrated interactions can emerge as an effective description of the parent jc hamiltonian ( [ eq : h jc ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved when considering an elongated geometry of the square array , @xmath114 .",
    "on one hand this circumvents the limitations related to realizing effective spin hamiltonians with frustrated interactions using optical setups governed by jc hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that one can simulate the parent jc model in the regime where it yields the effective spin model using qmc avoiding thus a sign problem of the spin model which opens up an interesting perspective on the qmc simulations of hamiltonians with sign problem .",
    "in this work we have analysed the ground states of a cavity array where each intersection of cavity modes is occupied by a single atom .",
    "we have shown that the system s description in terms of the jc model leads to an effective description - in a suitable parameter regime , where the cavity modes can be adiabatically eliminated - in terms of a two - component spin model . in one dimension ,",
    "we have provided exact solution of the spin model demonstrating explicitly the need of higher dimensions in order to obtain frustrated spin - spin interactions . using large - scale qmc simulation of the jc model",
    "we have performed a quantitative comparison between the parent jc and the emerging spin model .",
    "specifically , in two dimensions , we have studied the superradiant phase transition and the properties of two - point correlation functions in the cavity array and we have described the graph - theoretical structure of the ground states of the spin model . in all cases we found a firm agreement between the two models in the regime of validity of the approximations used .",
    "finally , we have outlined the possibility , by exploiting the non - linearities of the effective spin model , of studying frustrated spin hamiltonians using two - dimensional cavity arrays .    in conclusion , the theoretical framework and numerical tools established in this work open ways to address the cavity qed physics in a quantitative way beyond the traditional mean - field or perturbative treatments .",
