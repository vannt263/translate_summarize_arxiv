    "for almost 30 years the schechter luminosity function ( lf ; @xcite ) has been the standard tool for quantifying the galaxy population has three key parameters , @xmath1 the characteristic luminosity where the exponential cutoff cuts in , @xmath2 , the normalisation at this characteristic luminosity , and @xmath3 , the faint - end slope parameter .",
    "a value of @xmath4 implies equal numbers of galaxies in magnitude intervals , a more negative ( or steep ) value implies numerous dwarf systems . ] .",
    "the lf is loosely based on the press - schechter formalisation for the primordial halo distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover the lf consistently provides a good formal fit to the observed luminosity distribution ( ld ; see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this consistency , between the ld and lf , appears to hold regardless of environment ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the only departure from a pure schechter function appears to be in the central cores of rich clusters , where the galaxy ld is often seen to show a marked upturn at the giant - dwarf boundary ( @xmath5 mag ) .",
    "perhaps the most well known example is the central ld of the coma cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the core contains an overdensity of giant and dwarf ellipticals bolstering both the bright and faint - end of the core cluster lf .",
    "for example the more extensive coma survey by @xcite recovers a flat and invariant ld / lf ( @xmath6 ) to @xmath7 mag .",
    "the phenomena of an upturn in the ld , has also been seen in virgo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a963 ( @xcite ) , a868 ( @xcite ) , a2554 ( @xcite ) and a2218 ( @xcite ) for example . however , apart from these `` active '' core environments , the overall lds from the field , to the local group , to the local sphere , and near & far rich clusters all consistently follow a smooth lf within the luminosity ranges probed",
    "[ fig1 ] shows an ( incomplete ) summary of @xmath8 or @xmath9-band field and cluster lfs colour corrected to the johnson b filter .",
    "the main point to take from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that the global and cluster lfs each show a broad but overlapping range of distributions .",
    "clearly one can not reasonably argue for any significant variation between the global and overall cluster environment on the basis of these data .",
    "studies based within the same survey data , for example the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey study by @xcite , generally find fairly subtle changes with environment .",
    "hence it seems that the variations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates an unspecified systematic error in the various studies .",
    "the most lauded of these is the unsavoury topic of surface brightness selection effects ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the concern is that the galaxy population at each luminosity interval occupies a range in surface brightness ( or size ) .",
    "surveys with shallow detection isophotes may miss both light from a galaxy s halo , as well as entire galaxies ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite explored this possibility in detail and demonstrated that indeed surface brightness selection effects can play havoc with the recovered schechter function parameters and reproduce exactly the kind of variation seen in both the global and cluster lfs of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "more recently a number of papers have identified a clear luminosity - surface brightness ( or size)+36.57 $ ] where @xmath10 is the effective surface brightness , @xmath11 the absolute magnitude , and @xmath12 the semi - major axis half - light radius in kpc , hence the luminosity - surface brightness relation can be readily transformed to a luminosity - size distribution and we use the acronym lsp to indicate either . ] relation for field galaxies based on diverse datasets including : the hubble deep field @xcite ; the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite ; the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and a very local inclination and dust corrected sample of late - type disks @xcite .",
    "these studies consistently show that low surface brightness is synonymous with low luminosity  with a few notable exceptions as typified by malin 1 @xcite and the faint second disk surrounding ngc5084 .    to fully resolve the potential impact of surface brightness selection effects one must consider the joint luminosity - surface brightness distribution .",
    "this has been advocated in the past , not so much to compensate for selection bias , but to preserve the size ( or surface brightness ) information which may be of interest in its own right ( see @xcite and @xcite for instance ) .",
    "this latter point is illustrated in plate 1 , where i show an example lf for a nearby volume limited sample and images of the actual galaxies contributing to the lf .",
    "clearly much information is lost when one replaces these images with three simple numbers .",
    "it is for these reasons  the need to accommodate selection bias and the desire to explore additional parameter space  coupled with the abundance of data that now moves us beyond the simple ld / lf to start exploring multivariate distributions . here",
    "i introduce two such distributions , the luminosity - surface brightness plane ( for the reasons stated above ) and the colour - luminosity plane which is also of topical interest ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to construct multivariate distributions requires an extensive wide area survey ( @xmath13 ) , to reasonable depth ( @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) , with reasonable resolution ( fwhm @xmath16 ) , wavelength coverage ( e.g. , some of @xmath17etc ) and spectroscopic redshifts / distances .",
    "the most notable catalogues for this purpose are : the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xmath18 , 1800 sq deg , 250k z s ; @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xmath19 , 10000 sq deg , 1 m z s ; @xcite ) , the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; @xmath0+sdss , 37 sq deg , 10k z s ; @xcite ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xmath20 , all sky , sdss+2df+6df+mgc z s , @xcite ) . the mgc , although the smallest in area , is also the deepest ( @xmath21 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) , highest resolution ( fwhm @xmath22 ) and most complete survey ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". it also overlaps with the other three surveys and hence provides a `` best of all worlds '' hybrid dataset  for example 50 per cent of the @xmath23 mgc redshifts derive from the 2dfgrs or sdss , extensive optical colour coverage from sdss , and partial near - ir coverage from 2mass . the mgcjliske / mgc/ ( additional catalogues including redshift , morphological and structural parameters are available on request from spd@mso.anu.edu.au ) . ]",
    "contains 10,061 resolved galaxies with @xmath24 mag with 95 per cent complete redshift coverage .",
    "all galaxies have been analysed with a variety of software packages including sextractor ( @xcite ) , gim2d ( @xcite ) and eyeball classified to @xmath25 mag .",
    "the luminosity - surface brightness plane ( lsp ) is of particular interest because it enables one to compensate for both luminosity ( malmquist bias ) _ and _ surface brightness selection effects ( aka `` disney bias '' ) . in @xcite",
    "the lsp is derived for the mgc , which provides the most robust current estimate .",
    "the mgc lsp analysis used the joint luminosity - surface brightness step - wise maximum likelihood method of @xcite and incorporate into this tracking of 5 selection boundaries relevant to each individual galaxy ( _ i.e. , _ maximum & minimum observable size & flux and minimum observable central surface brightness for detection , see @xcite ) .",
    "an additional feature is the derivation of individual k - corrections using the combined mgc and sdss - dr1 colours ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the data as a series of gaussian fits across the lsp at progressive intervals of absolute magnitude .",
    "the thicker weighted lines shows the surface brightness distribution for the most luminous galaxies and the fainter lines for the dwarf regime .",
    "two facts leap out .",
    "firstly that the distributions are bounded ( the gaussian fits have good @xmath27 s ) broadening towards lower luminosity .",
    "secondly the peak of the distribution moves towards lower surface brightness for lower luminosity systems .",
    "in other words low luminosity systems apparently show greater surface brightness diversity than giant systems . however this can also be interpreted in terms of the kormendy relation for spheriods ( @xcite ) and freeman s law for disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two classic studies unveiled distinct relations for the structural properties of spheroid and disk components .",
    "the kormendy study found that the more luminous the spheroid the lower its central surface brightness .",
    "conversely freeman s study found that all disks , regardless of luminosity , have a constant central surface brightness of @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath15 . the mgc result shown on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are for the combined bulge+disk systems . around @xmath1",
    "the effective surface brightness for spheriods and disks is fairly close  a long - time nagging coincidence . however moving towards lower luminosity",
    "the trends for spheriods and disks diverge leading to the broadening of the global surface brightness distribution . to investigate further",
    "hence requires separating out these two structural components via 2d bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "here we use gim2d ( @xcite ) and fig .",
    "[ sball ] shows the data of fig .  2 subdivided by structural component .",
    "the dotted line shows the original freeman distribution which remains relevant today , albeit with a far broader dispersion than originally reported ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it would seem that galaxies consist of two principle components ( presumably formed via two mechanisms : merging and accretion / collapse ? ) and to unravel these two phases in detail must require robust bulge - disk decompositions of extensive samples over a variety of epochs .",
    "the next most obvious key global parameter , after luminosity and surface brightness ( size ) is colour , and in particular the rest @xmath29 which straddles the 4000 - break and hence a crude indicator of the current star - formation rate . @xcite and @xcite have recently studied this plane extensively with sdss data and demonstrate clear bimodality of the colour distribution .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows this trend for the 10k galaxies of the mgc ( using sdss colours ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] also shows this trend for the bulge and disks separately .",
    "to obtain the bulge colour we use the sdss psf magnitudes and to obtain the disk colour and we remove the bulge colour component from the global colour to reveal the disk colour - r_t -2.5 \\log[10^{(1-b / t)}]$ ] where the filter subscript refers to total petrosian magnitude ( t ) , disk ( d ) or bulge psf magnitude ( b ) . ] .",
    "we now see that the bimodal distribution can readily be explained in terms of predominantly red bulges and blue disks .",
    "this component segregation implies distinct stellar populations with distinct evolutionary paths .",
    "bulges must contain old stellar population and disks intermediate or young populations .",
    "again this follows conventional wisdom but highlights yet further the important of bulge - disk decomposition and the need to study the component properties of galaxies rather than the global properties .",
    "the two distributions outlined above , both suggest that the well known bulge and disk components of galaxies follow distinct trends in both the surface brightness ( size ) distribution and colour distribution .",
    "this is of course not particularly new , however what is exciting is our ability to quantify these distributions and trends in detail for large statistical samples , and to extend this kind of structural analysis to higher redshift .",
    "in particular the data resolution and signal - to - noise of the ground - based data discussed above is comparable to that available with the hubble space telescope ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the upcoming james webb space telescope .",
    "there is nothing , other than hard diligent work , to prevent us from quantifying the evolution of these distributions across the entire path length of the universe .",
    "however three further issues are worth raising :    * 1 ) which wavelength is optimal for structural studies of galaxies ? *",
    "\\2 ) how might we push back the boundaries into the dwarf regime ?",
    "\\3 ) can we connect structural measurements to the properties of the dark matter halo ?",
    "traditionally , almost all nearby galaxy catalogues have been based on flux - limited observations through an optical @xmath0 or blue bandpass filter ( @xmath30 nm ) , for example : the rc3 ; the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ; the millennium galaxy catalogue etc .",
    "this has been driven by technological / commercial necessity with flux detectors typically optimised to the spectral response of the human eye ( @xmath31 nm ) .",
    "however the most physically meaningful bandpass in which to observe a galaxy is in the near - ir ( rest-@xmath32 band or @xmath33 m ) .",
    "this is mostly because the stellar population that dominates the total stellar mass  and therefore best traces a galaxy s gravitational potential  is the long - lived low - mass population which emits in the near - ir ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated by the obviously smoother appearance of a galaxy in the near - ir than in progressively bluer wavelengths ( see upper panel of fig .  [ fig6 ] showing a montage of images for m51 in a variety of filters  the near - ir images ( right most ) are significantly smoother .",
    "the flux and shape of a galaxy in the near - ir is most dependent on the older relaxed stellar population and therefore a better tracer of the underlying potential .",
    "conversely the flux and shape in the optical is linked to the young stars and therefore dependent on the current and possibly transient star - formation rate .",
    "both optical and near - ir data are important if one wishes to understand galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the near - ir however appears to be the optimal filter for the investigation of the structural properties .",
    "the other great advantage is of course the minimisation of the impact of dust obscuration .",
    "this is illustrated in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] which shows the location of the @xmath0 and @xmath32 band filters superimposed on the night sky spectrum ( dotted line ) , a galaxy s continuum before and after star - burst ( solid lines ) , and the dust attenuation curve ( long dashed line ) .",
    "the impact of star - formation and dust is clearly less in the near - ir . the upcoming near - ir facilities and in particular the ukirt / wfcam and vista will have the capabilities to provide exactly the kind of wide , deep , high resolution data required for the comprehensive structural analysis of nearby galaxies .",
    "the space density of dwarf galaxies remains elusive . figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  &  [ fig2 ] shows that the mgc can only sample with credibility to @xmath34 mag at which point both limiting statistics and the high and low surface brightness selection limits bite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates this by showing the mgc galaxies on an absolute magnitude versus redshift plot .",
    "the data are of course bounded by the @xmath35 mag limit which highlights the rapidly diminishing volume observed for low luminosity systems .",
    "one way to overcome this is to simply conduct ever deeper redshift surveys ( as indicated on the figure ) .",
    "however this has a diminishing return as the number of galaxies one must observe to find one low luminosity system becomes unreasonable .",
    "one possible way forward is to use photometric redshifts to pre - select low - z candidates and then follow - up only these systems .",
    "however the accuracy of photometric redshifts at low z is poor ( although improved by near - ir colours , see @xcite for example ) . to overcome the surface brightness selection limits ( both high and low ) the source data",
    "must be improved to probe to very high resolution ( @xmath36 ) and very deep isophotes ( @xmath37 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) over wide areas ( @xmath38 sq deg ) .",
    "no such survey exists but facilities such as subaru / suprime and magellan / imacs just about have the capability to achieve such a survey .",
    "the alternative method is to observe the very local galaxy population ( i.e. , the local sphere of influence , defined as that within 10 mpc ) and obtain direct distance measurements rather than redshifts .",
    "the lsp may have the potential to connect key observables ( luminosity and size ) to the fundamental underlying physical properties of bulge and disk systems ( mass and angular momentum ) .",
    "in various studies of the formation of disk systems , ( _ e.g. , _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the dimensionless spin parameter ( @xmath39 , @xcite ) is directly related to the scale - length of the disk .",
    "the spin parameter reflects how close the halo is to a rotationally supported system and is a key parameter monitored by the numerical simulations ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; maller , dekel & sommerville 2002 for example ) . the pivotal idea ( here echoing the toy model of @xcite )",
    "starts with the premise that the baryons are coupled to the dark matter halo , because of this the luminosity ( generated by the baryons in the form of stars ) can be related to the systemic mass and the rotation of the stars / gas can be related to the systemic angular momentum . given this premise , which is intimated by the tully - fisher relation",
    ", one can analytically relate @xmath40 to luminosity and surface brightness ( or size ) : @xmath41 ( from @xcite ) , where @xmath42 is the effective surface brightness , @xmath43 is the intrinsic luminosity in some filter and @xmath44 is the dependence of luminosity on the mass - to - light ratio ( equal to 0.69 in @xmath0 or 1.00 in @xmath32 @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations consistently find that the distribution of the spin parameter is a log normal distribution which is globally preserved through hierarchical merging ( see for example @xcite ) this yields : @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "hence the gradient of any luminosity - surface brightness relation bears upon the relation between mass and light and the dispersion upon the breadth of the spin distribution .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the @xmath0-band lsp for a variety of samples as indicated ( lg , @xcite ; hdf , @xcite ; mgc , @xcite ; mw gcs , harris et al ( priv .",
    "comm ) ; local sphere of influence , @xcite ; lsbgs , @xcite ) .",
    "the solid lines show the approximate expectation as argued above and show remarkable agreement with the data - in detail the observed size distribution is marginally narrower than simulations predict ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that systems which form via merging ( i.e. , bulges ) and via accretion ( i.e. , disks ) are also predicted to show distinct @xmath40 distributions ( see for example @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the moment",
    "far more data and detailed simulations are required however this connection is clearly promising and could ultimately result in a galaxy equivalent to the hertzsprung - russell diagram , allowing a meeting ground between numerical simulations and survey observations .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function is not the only fruit , and with the many legacy datasets becoming available the time is now ripe to move beyond the lf and explore multivariate distributions . here",
    "i ve presented two : the luminosity surface brightness ( size ) plane ( lsp ) ; and the colour luminosity plane ( clp ) .",
    "both planes show that disks and bulges form distinct but overlapping distributions presumably indicating secular evolution of these components , i.e. , two mechanisms and two timescales .",
    "this finding argues for the community to move away from global measurements and start to measure the properties of these distinct components independently .",
    "we argue that this is best done in the near - ir and should be a key focus of upcoming ir facilities such as vista ( low - z ) & jwst ( high - z ) .",
    "perhaps most important of all the lsp appears to provide a direct meeting ground to the numerical simulations .",
    "this last point is by far the most important as its from the cross - talk between simulations and observations that real insight into the processes of galaxy evolution and formation will come .",
    "i am indebted to my colleagues on the mgc and to the hard work of those that have slaved on the superb 2dfgrs , sdss and 2mass facilities and databases .",
    "these data are changing the way we view galaxies in a profound way .",
    "finally i d like to thank the organisers for a very enjoyable meeting and support from pparc as a visiting fellow to the university of bristol where this article was revised ."
