    "as the lhc approaches the first 10 fb@xmath1 of 7 and 8 tev data , we are entering a new era in higgs physics .",
    "we will soon know whether or not a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson exists .",
    "it becomes then an urgent and fascinating question to verify that any observed particle does  or does not  have the couplings and properties expected of the sm higgs boson .",
    "recent results presented by atlas and cms suggest a light sm - like higgs may soon emerge from the data in the mass range below 130 gev @xcite .",
    "for such a higgs boson , the smallness of the @xmath2 quark yukawa coupling means that its total sm width is tiny : at 125 gev , @xmath3 is only 4 mev .",
    "thus , a light sm - like higgs boson is especially sensitive to the existence of physics beyond the standard model : even weak couplings to new light degrees of freedom can have an @xmath4 effect on the higgs branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting candidate for new degrees of freedom into which the higgs might decay is dark matter ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "dark matter can couple to the sm through the higgs portal  @xcite , which provides one of two leading interactions for physics in other sectors to couple to the sm . at colliders ,",
    "higgs - to - dm decays are invisible apart from large missing energy .",
    "the higgs portal coupling also feeds into the higgs - mediated dm - nuclear cross section , correlating the results of direct dm detection experiments with searches for invisible higgs - to - dm decays at colliders .",
    "this correlation is not rigid , in the sense that a nonobservation in direct detection does not imply that the higgs - to - dm branching ratio is small  @xcite , but the two handles are complementary and can be used together to constrain models for dm ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , there are many compelling reasons to imagine that new light degrees of freedom exist and couple preferentially to the higgs rather than to other parts of the sm .",
    "several questions of naturalness in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) can be remedied by extending the mssm higgs sector with a singlet superfield  @xcite .",
    "higgs decays into either the singlet or the singlino can then lead to cascade or invisible decays of the higgs ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "other examples which have been analyzed recently include decays of the higgs through pseudo - goldstone bosons to four jets  @xcite , multiple susy - breaking sectors where the higgs decays to two goldstini  @xcite , and a general analysis of higgs descendants in  @xcite . in such scenarios , the higgs is often produced with cross - sections close to the sm values , while the branching fractions to bsm particles can be large .",
    "searching for non - standard decay channels of a sm - like higgs at the 7 tev lhc therefore is a flexible , generic , and extremely well - motivated probe of physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is also critical as a cross check of the sm higgs production cross - sections : a universal discrepancy between the measured and expected higgs cross - sections could be due either to suppression of the production cross - section from mixing with another degree of freedom , or suppression of the visible branching fractions by decay to invisible or buried  @xcite final states .",
    "the tiny higgs width in the low - mass region is too small to measure through its line shape , as might be imagined for a heavy higgs @xcite .",
    "the scenarios can only be distinguished by directly observing the nonstandard decay mode of the higgs boson .",
    "existing searches for an invisibly - decaying higgs at lep  @xcite have set an upper bound on its mass at 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) of 114.4 gev , assuming sm production and 100% higgs decay into invisibles . at hadron colliders ,",
    "an invisible higgs signature is more difficult than at lepton colliders , as the inability to reconstruct events makes it challenging to separate the signal from the the large physics backgrounds coming from @xmath0 ( and @xmath5 ) , which live at a similar mass scale as the signal .",
    "however , the invisible decay mode is still comparatively easy to detect .",
    "large missing energy is a relatively clean signal of electroweak physics , cleaner than , for example , @xmath6-jets , and a signal in this channel may even be accessible in the 7 tev lhc run .",
    "both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies of an invisible higgs at the 14 tev lhc have been performed , focusing on higgs production from weak vector boson fusion ( wbf ) or in association with the @xmath0 boson .",
    "higgs production from gluon fusion plus one additional initial state radiation ( isr ) jet has not been considered a promising channel at the lhc .",
    "our aim in the current work is to update these studies and estimate the sensitivity of the 7 tev and 8 tev lhc to an invisibly decaying higgs .",
    "we first assess existing bounds on an invisible higgs .",
    "the most stringent constraints are indirect , coming from the reinterpretation of sm higgs exclusions as lower bounds on an invisible branching fraction , assuming sm higgs production .",
    "there are also direct constraints arising from existing searches in both mono - jet@xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite , which we translate into bounds on the higgs production times invisible branching fraction , @xmath9 these searches are sensitive to a light invisible higgs , produced through @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we find that the mono - jet searches currently provide a better limit than the @xmath12 channel , although a targeted optimization of the @xmath12 channel might change this picture .",
    "having established existing limits , we study the most sensitive channel for a light invisible higgs , namely weak vector boson fusion , @xmath13 .",
    "we perform a detailed detector - level study of the wbf channel to estimate the 7 tev and 8 tev lhc reach . incorporating improved strategies for controlling systematic errors",
    ", we find that invisible rates down to @xmath14 can be excluded at 95% cl with 20 fb@xmath1 at 7 tev and a similar reach is found at 8 tev .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly discuss simple reference models which can give the higgs an appreciable invisible branching fraction without altering electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the remainder of the paper is dedicated to estimating the sensitivity of the 7 and 8 tev lhc to an invisible higgs decay mode . in sections  [ sec : monojet ] and  [ sec : associated ] we adapt existing monojet@xmath7 and @xmath15 searches to establish current limits on @xmath16 from these channels . in section  [ sec : wbf ] we perform a detailed study of the weak boson fusion channel at the 7 tev lhc , which we find is the most sensitive channel . in section  [ section : wbf8 ] , we additionally estimate the sensitivity of the 8 tev lhc in this channel . in section  [ sec : combination ] we compare the invisible search reach to the visible search reach and discuss the ability of the 8 tev lhc to constrain the hypothesis of an invisibly decaying higgs through combinations of visible and invisible channels .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a @xmath17 symmetry to protect one new particle beyond the standard model from decaying . this new particle could be a scalar @xmath18 ( taken to be real ) or a dirac fermion @xmath19 , which are sm singlets .",
    "here we neglect the case of a new spin - one particle  @xcite . starting from the scalar field  @xcite , we have the following potential , v(h , s ) = - ^2hh^+ ( h h^)^2 + _ s^2s^2 + _ ss^4 + hh^s^2 .",

    "the coupling modifying the higgs decay is v(h , s ) = v h s^2/2 + , which provides an invisible decay width for the higgs boson , ( h s s ) = . for a light higgs boson ,",
    "the dominant decay channel in the sm is into two @xmath2 quarks . since the bottom yukawa coupling is small , it is easy to modify the total width of higgs boson and to suppress the sm visible decay branching ratios .",

    "[ fig : currentlimit ] for 20 fb@xmath1/channel at 8 tev ( projections for visible channels are made with @xmath126 rescaling of the expected limits given in  @xcite . ) for sufficiently large invisible widths , the total higgs width can begin to exceed the experimental resolution of the higgs bump , which would weaken the limits from the visible channels .",
    "this effect is not large , and negligible in the very light ( @xmath127 gev ) range of most interest .",
    "we use the expected limits from the visible channel searches directly without modification .",
    "even better limits may be derived by combining the visible and invisible sm higgs searches . allowing the cross section to float",
    ", one can make the usual `` brazil - band '' plots , where now the @xmath128-axis parametrizes a space of models that differ from the ihh by a universal rescaling @xmath129 of each channel s rate .",
    "limits below @xmath130 exclude the ihh for a given pair @xmath131 .",
    "strong limits will motivate a variety of interpretations not covered by the ihh  perhaps there is no higgs , or the higgs is buried , or the production cross section is suppressed .",
    "values of @xmath132 can be interpreted as a minimum required universal suppression factor of the cross section , or one minus the minimum required branching ratio into `` buried '' final states .",
    "we can make estimates for the combined reach of sm+invisible search channels with a quadrature combination of the statistical significances , or inverse quadrature combination of the individual limits on @xmath129 , @xmath133 here @xmath134 denotes the 95% cl limit on @xmath129 .",
    "since the error bars in each channel include systematic errors that are in general correlated across channels , our combinations are approximate and intended only to suggest the potential interplay between visible and invisible channels . to estimate the search sensitivity to the visible higgs decay modes , we use the recent expected limits from cms @xcite as they combine several channels with ( almost ) uniform luminosity per channel .",
    "the expected limits obtained from a combination of cms visible channels and the wbf invisible channel at 20 fb@xmath1/channel and 8 tev are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : combsig ] as a function of @xmath99 and @xmath135 .",
    "we use only the wbf channel ; in principle the reach could be extended using monojet and in particular @xmath63 in combination .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : combsig ] shows the reach for @xmath136 without channel combination , demonstrating the increase in sensitivity afforded by the combination , particularly at low higgs masses .         for low higgs masses ,",
    "the invisible reach is increasingly comparable to the visible channels .",
    "if the expected reach in invisible channels with @xmath137 is comparable to the expected reach in visible channels with @xmath138 , then the combined expected reach for mixed branching ratios is weaker  for this reason @xmath139 at @xmath117 gev has lower significance than either @xmath140 or @xmath137 at the same mass .    similarly , if a signal is seen in the sm higgs search channels , but the best - fit rate is less than expected from the sm",
    ", the invisible channels will be relevant .",
    "if a signal is observed in these channels , then an sm+invisible combination becomes very interesting ; if no invisible signal is detected then this suggests either altered production cross - sections or different beyond - the - sm decay modes .",
    "if a higgs - like particle is observed at the lhc , measuring its properties in detail is important for understanding the emerging description of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "new physics beyond the standard model can distort the higgs production cross - sections and branching fractions .",
    "the branching fractions of a light higgs ( @xmath141 , and in particular @xmath142 gev ) are particularly sensitive to the existence of new light degrees of freedom , owing to the small sm width of a higgs below the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "searching for beyond - the - sm decays of a higgs boson is thus an important cross check of higgs properties .",
    "we have focused here on light higgs decay into invisible particles , as ( 1 ) these decays are theoretically well motivated by the existence of dark matter among other considerations , and ( 2 ) the signatures of these decays are relatively clean , allowing sensitivity to branching fractions @xmath143 already at the 7 and 8 tev lhc .",
    "we have studied the 7 and 8 tev lhc reach for invisibly decaying higgs bosons .",
    "we have obtained the current direct upper limits on @xmath144 from experimental searches in @xmath145 and @xmath146 final states , and performed a full detector - level study of the weak vector boson fusion channel , which is the most sensitive .",
    "our analysis of the wbf channel is the first study at 7 and 8 tev for the signal @xmath147 invisibles .",
    "we find , after inclusion of the @xmath148 jets contribution to the signal and arguing for the use of reweighted @xmath149 jets to reduce the systematic errors in the @xmath150jets backgrounds , that invisible higgs branching fractions as low as @xmath151 can be excluded with 20 fb@xmath1 of data at 7 and 8 tev for all higgs masses below 170 gev .",
    "finally , we have considered the complementarity between searches in visible and invisible channels .",
    "if the branching ratios are highly mixed , then the hypothesis of invisible higgs decays ( as opposed to direct suppression of the higgs production cross section ) can be efficiently tested by a combination of the two types of channels .",
    "the interesting question of establishing whether higgs production and decay are indeed sm - like is thus one that the lhc can begin to usefully address even in the low - energy run .",
