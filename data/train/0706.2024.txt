    "in infectious disease epidemiology , the _ serial interval _ is the difference between the symptom onset time of an infected person and the symptom onset time of his or her infector @xcite .",
    "this is sometimes called the generation interval .  however , we find it more useful to adopt the terminology of svensson @xcite and define the _ generation interval _ as the difference between the infection time of an infected person and the infection time of his or her infector .  by these definitions ,",
    "the serial interval is observable while the generation interval usually is not .",
    "we define _ infectious contact _ from @xmath0 to @xmath1 to be a contact that is sufficient to infect @xmath1 if @xmath0 is infectious and @xmath1 is susceptible , and we define a _ potential infector _ of person @xmath0 to be an infectious person who has positive probability of making infectious contact with @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we use the term _ hazard _ rather than _ force of infection _ to highlight the similarities between epidemic data analysis and survival analysis .",
    "the generation interval has been an important input for epidemic models used to investigate the transmission and control of sars @xcite and pandemic influenza @xcite .",
    "more recently , generation interval distributions have been used to calculate the incubation period distribution of sars @xcite and to estimate @xmath2 from the exponential growth rate at the beginning of an epidemic @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that the generation interval distribution is characteristic of an infectious disease .  in this paper",
    ", we show that this is not true .",
    "instead , the expected generation interval decreases as the number of potential infectors of susceptibles increases .  during an epidemic , generation intervals tend to contract as the prevalence of infection increases .",
    "this effect was described by svensson @xcite for an sir model with homogeneous mixing .  in this paper",
    ", we extend this result to all time - homogeneous stochastic sir  models .",
    "a simple thought experiment illustrates the intuition behind our main result .",
    "imagine a susceptible person @xmath1 in a room .",
    "place @xmath3 other persons in the room and infect them all at time @xmath4",
    ".  for simplicity , assume that infectious contact from @xmath0 to @xmath1 occurs with probability one , @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a continuous nonnegative random variable denoting the first time at which @xmath0 makes infectious contact with @xmath1 .",
    "person @xmath1 is infected at time @xmath7 .  since all infectious persons were infected at time zero",
    ", @xmath8 is the generation interval .",
    "if we repeat the experiment with larger and larger @xmath3 , the expected value of @xmath9 will decrease .",
    "when a susceptible person is at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources , there is a race  to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection .",
    "generation interval contraction is an example of a well - known phenomenon in epidemiology : the expected time to an outcome , given that the outcome occurs , decreases in the presence of competing risks .  in our thought experiment , the outcome is the infection of @xmath1 by a given @xmath0 and the competing risks are infectious contacts from all sources other than @xmath0 .",
    "adapting our thought experiment slightly , we see that the contraction of the generation interval is a consequence of the fact that the hazard of infection for @xmath1 increases as the number of potential infectors increases .",
    "let @xmath10 be the hazard of infectious contact from any potential infector to @xmath1 at time @xmath11 and let @xmath12 $ ] be the expected infection time of @xmath1 given @xmath3 potential infectors .  then @xmath13   & = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-m\\lambda(t)}dt\\\\ & > \\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-(m+1)\\lambda(t)}dt = e[t_{j}|m+1],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the expected generation interval decreases as the number of potential infectors increases .",
    "a hazard of infection that increases with the number of potential infectors is a defining feature of most epidemic models , so generation interval contraction is a very general phenomenon .",
    "we note that a very similar phenomenon occurs in endemic diseases , where increased force of infection results in a decreased average age at first infection @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe a general stochastic sir epidemic model .  in section 3",
    ", we use this model to show that the mean generation interval decreases as the number of potential infectors increases .  as a corollary",
    ", we find that the mean serial interval also decreases .  in section 4",
    ", we consider the role of the population contact structure in generation interval contraction and illustrate the effects of global and local competition among potential infectors with simulations .  in section 5",
    ", we argue that hazards of infectious contact should be used instead of generation or serial interval distributions in the analysis of epidemic data .",

    "we start with a very general stochastic `` susceptible - infectious - removed '' ( sir ) epidemic model .",

    "we keep track of the infection times of the primary and secondary case in each infector / infectee pair and the prevalence of infection at the infection time of the secondary case , which is a proxy for the amount of competition to infect the secondary case .",
    "we then calculate a smoothed mean of the generation interval as a function of the infection time of the primary case in each pair",
    ".  another valid approach would be to calculate the smoothed means from the results of many simulations .",
    "we did not take this approach for the following reasons : ( i ) because of variation in the time course of different realizations of the same stochastic sir  model , many simulations would be required to obtain a curve that reliably approximates the asymptotic limit .",

    "if there is a vector of parameters @xmath185 for each pair @xmath90 ( which may include individual - level covariates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as pairwise covariates for the ordered pair @xmath90 ) and a vector of parameters @xmath147 such that latexmath:[$\\lambda_{ij}(\\tau|r_{i})=\\lambda(\\tau    @xmath147 can be obtained by multiplying equation ( [ pfail ] ) over all @xmath3 observed failure times .",
    "if @xmath48 denotes the index of the @xmath49 person infected , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 , then the partial likelihood is @xmath189 this is very similar to partial likelihoods that arise in survival analysis , so many techniques from survival analysis may be adaptable for use in the analysis of epidemic data .",
    "the goal of such methods would be to allow statistical inference about the effects of individual and pairwise covariates on the hazard of infection in ordered pairs of individuals .  in the ordered pair @xmath90 ,",
    "the effects of individual covariates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath168 would reflect the infectiousness of @xmath0 and the susceptibility of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "pairwise covariates could include such information as whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in the same household , the distance between their households , whether they are sexual partners , and any other aspects of their relationship to each other thay may affect the hazard of infection from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "this approach has several advantages over any approach based on a distribution of generation or serial intervals .",
    "first , it is not necessary to determine who infected whom in any subset of observed infections .",
    "if @xmath190 is known for some @xmath1 , this knowledge can be incorporated in the partial likelihood by replacing the term for the failure time of person @xmath1 in ( [ lp ] ) with @xmath191 from equation ( [ pjk ] ) .",
    "second , this approach allows the use individual - level and pairwise covariates for inference in a flexible and intuitive way .",
    "the resulting estimated hazard functions have a straightforward interpretation and can be incorporated naturally into a stochastic sir model .",
    "third , this approach allows theory and methods from survival analysis to be applied to the analysis of epidemic data .",
    "generation and serial interval distributions are not stable characteristics of an infectious disease .  when multiple infectious persons compete to infect a given susceptible person , infection is caused by the first person to make infectious contact .  in section 3",
    ", we showed that the mean infectious contact interval @xmath21 given that @xmath0 actually infected @xmath1 is less than or equal to the mean @xmath21 given @xmath0 made infectious contact with @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath64\\leq e[\\tau_{ij}|\\tau_{ij}<\\infty],\\ ] ] with strict inequality when @xmath21 is non - constant and @xmath1 is at risk of infectious contact from any source other than @xmath0 ( more precise conditions are given in section 3 ) .",
    "this result holds for all time - homogeneous stochastic sir models .     in an epidemic ,",
    "the mean generation ( and serial ) intervals contract as the prevalence of infection increases and susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources .  in the simulations of section 4",
    ", we saw that the degree of contraction increases with @xmath2 .  for models with clustering of contacts ,",
    "generation interval contraction can occur even when the global prevalence of infection is low because susceptibles are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources within their own clusters .  in all of the simulations , the greatest serial interval contraction coincided with the peak prevalence of infection , when the risk of infectious contacts from multiple sources was highest .",
    "the mean generation interval increases again as the epidemic wanes , but this rebound may be small when @xmath2 is high .",
    "the reason that generation and serial intervals contract during an epidemic is that their definition applies to pairs of individuals @xmath90 such that @xmath0 actually transmitted infection to @xmath1 .",
    "if we do nt require that an infectious contact leads to the transmission of infection , we are led naturally to the concept of the infectious contact interval , which has a well - defined distribution throughout an epidemic .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath2 as the mean number of infectious contacts ( i.e. , finite infectious contact intervals ) made by a primary case without reference to a completely susceptible population .",
    "generation and serial intervals and the effective reproductive number can then be defined in terms of infectious contacts that actually lead to the transmission of infection .",
    "many fundamental concepts in infectious disease epidemiology can be simplified usefully by defining them in terms of infectious contact rather than infection transmission .",
    "infectious contact hazards for ordered pairs of individuals can be used for many of the same types of analysis that have been attempted using generation or serial interval distributions .  in section 5",
    ", we derived a hazard - based estimator of @xmath142 very similar to that developed by wallinga and teunis @xcite .",
    "this derivation led naturally to a partial likelihood for epidemic data very similar to those that arise in survival analysis .",
    "we believe that the adaptation of methods and theory from survival analysis to infectious disease epidemiology will yield flexible and powerful tools for epidemic data analysis .",
