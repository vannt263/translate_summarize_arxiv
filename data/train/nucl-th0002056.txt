    "the elastic scattering @xmath4 reaction has been studied recently by several authors @xcite in order to investigate the existence of a resonance or a quasibound state in this system , for which there are experimental indications @xcite .",
    "some of these studies concluded that such an state would exist for certain values of the two - body @xmath1n data .",
    "however , since they used in one form or another incomplete information on the two - body subsystems ( in particular that corresponding to the @xmath2 sector ) , we believe that a new calculation is required which takes into account all the information that is now available",
    ". in particular , we study the effect of the repulsion at short distances of the @xmath3 interaction and take into account the @xmath5 scattering amplitude that has been determined recently @xcite",
    ".    we will present the faddeev formalism in section ii . in section iii",
    "we will first calculate the eta - deuteron scattering length to compare with the results of multiple - scattering theories as well as with separable potentials models and finally we will present the predictions of our model for @xmath4 scattering",
    ". we will give our conclusions in section iv .",
    "let us consider a system of three particles , where two of them are identical , interacting pairwise through separable potentials that act only in s - waves . in the case of the @xmath4 system ,",
    "s - wave means , for the eta - nucleon pair the @xmath6 channel , and for the nucleon - nucleon pair the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the two - body t - matrix of the pair @xmath8 will be assumed of the separable form    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 will be specified later . in the following",
    "we will identify particle 1 with the @xmath1 and the identical particles 2 and 3 with the two nucleons .",
    "the faddeev equations for the case of @xmath4 scattering can be solved explicitely for the @xmath12 transition amplitude @xmath13 , with nucleon 2 being the spectator particle in the final state .",
    "one obtains    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    and the driving term for the transition from the amplitude with spectator j in the initial state to the one with spectator i in the final state is    @xmath16    with    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the reduced masses    @xmath21    @xmath22    and the @xmath4 on - shell relative momentum @xmath23 is defined by the relation    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the binding energy of the deuteron .    the @xmath4 elastic - scattering amplitude is obtained from the solution of eq .",

    "we started by calculating the @xmath4 scattering length ( [ eq12 ] ) , by solving the integral equation ( [ eq2 ] ) with the method of matrix inversion after replacing the integration with a gaussian mesh .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) occurs for @xmath35 and is regularized by the integration volume element ) .",
    "additionally , we also calculated the integrated elastic cross section of @xmath4 scattering . in order to solve the integral equation ( [ eq2 ] ) above threshold",

    "we will calculate here the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath36 for the models proposed in refs .",

    "@xcite and in the multiple - scattering approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite the function @xmath40 for the @xmath2 subsystem , instead of being calculated , has been chosen independently of the form factor @xmath41 .",
    "such an assumption violates the spirit of the faddeev approach which requires a two - body interaction in order to relate the off - shell behavior of the t - matrix in the energy variable @xmath42 to the off - shell behavior in the momentum variable @xmath43 . nevertheless , it is instructive to repeat those calculations in order to check the accuracy of our numerical solution by comparing with the exact result of ref .",

    "@xcite , it was generated from a yamaguchi separable potential with an energy - dependent strength @xcite .",
    "using these parameters we calculated the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath36 with the formalism described in the previous section for a variety of values of the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath52 that have been proposed in the literature ( see refs .",
    "we show the results of this comparison in table i. the results of ref .",
    "@xcite using the ags formalism are given in column two and the ones obtained with the formalism of the previous section are given in column three .",
    "as one can see from table i there is very good agreement between the two calculations .",
    "the small discrepancies shown in some cases are of no significance since they occur for the values of @xmath52 allowing the quasibound state to occur and thereby the solutions are highly unstable . in our case ,",
    "in this situation we had to use a large number of mesh points in order to guarantee stability .    in the multiple - scattering approach of ref .",
    "@xcite an approximate formula was used which is based in a partial sumation of the multiple - scattering series .",
    "the function @xmath40 was taken to be constant    @xmath56    using the relation ( [ eq19 ] ) this gives    @xmath57    which will be referred to as their model i. they used also a second model which will be referred to as model ii for which instead of eq .",

    "for the nucleon - nucleon interaction they used a yamaguchi separable potential with a range parameter @xmath61 @xmath46 .    we compare in table ii the results of our exact calculations which we obtained using the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite with their results using an approximate formula for the two models i and ii . as it can be seen from this table , the approximate formula of the multiple scattering series works very well for small values of @xmath52 , as expected from convergence arguments .",
    "when @xmath52 is large the multiple scattering series formula deviates more from the exact result , nevertheless , it is still qualitatively correct , since it predicts correctly the quasibound states in all the cases where they exist for both models .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have seen that the models of refs . @xcite",
    "predict a quasibound state if the real part of @xmath52 is of the order of 0.7 - 0.8 fm .",
    "however , since their @xmath2 t - matrix is not derived from a potential their function @xmath40 is not constrained by their form factor @xmath41 .",
    "we will therefore construct separable potential models of the coupled @xmath2 - @xmath31 system that reproduce in one case just the complex scattering length @xmath52 for arbitrary values of the @xmath2 range - parameter @xmath62 and in another case the full @xmath2-@xmath2 scattering amplitude around the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "similarly , we will consider two different models of the @xmath3 interaction ; a simple yamaguchi potential that does not have short - range repulsion and a pest model which has the same half - off - shell behavior as the paris potential so that it contains short - range repulsion .",

    "( [ eq41 ] ) drops out and it becomes clear that in this case the strength of the @xmath2 potential is determined by the real part of the @xmath2 scattering length and the strength of the @xmath31 potential is determined by the imaginary part of the @xmath2 scattering length for a given value of the range @xmath62 . since this models are based in a yamaguchi form factor for the @xmath2 potential we will refer to them as @xmath83 models .",
    "we constructed also more realistic separable models that reproduce not only the @xmath2 scattering length but also the most important features of the @xmath6 resonance such as its position and width .",
    "for this we considered the @xmath6 amplitudes obtained from the analyses of refs .",
    "we found that with a simple yamaguchi model of the @xmath2 form factor is not possible to generate a resonance in the @xmath2 @xmath6 channel .",
    "we therefore changed the form factor @xmath84 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) to    @xmath85    while keeping for the @xmath31 form factor the yamaguchi form ( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "we give in table iii the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath62 , @xmath88 , @xmath78 of the coupled @xmath2-@xmath31 separable potentials fitted to the @xmath6 amplitudes of @xcite as well as to the models a , b , c , and d of @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 , as an example , the @xmath2-@xmath2 amplitude of ref . @xcite ( dashed lines ) compared with the ones of our separable - potential model .",
    "similar results are obtained for the other models . since these models generate a resonance in the @xmath2 channel we will refer to them as @xmath89 models . since we do not include the pion channel explicitly , only the @xmath90 component of the coupled @xmath2-@xmath31 t - matrix given by eq .",

    "we have considered two models ; the simple yamaguchi model used in ref .",
    "@xcite which has a range parameter @xmath61 @xmath60 ( which we will refer to as the @xmath92 model ) and the pest potential constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which we will refer to as the @xmath93 model ) that is of the form    @xmath94    where the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are given in ref .",
    "the half - off - shell t - matrix of this separable potential has the same behavior as that of the paris potential and therefore it takes into account the repulsion at short distances that is present in the nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "we give in table iv the results of our separable - potential models for the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath36 where we have considered all four combinations of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 separable - potential models . in the case of the @xmath2 yamaguchi model @xmath83",
    "we took the range parameter @xmath45 @xmath60 which is the same as in refs .",
    "here however the corresponding t - matrix is calculated through the lippmann - schwinger equation . in the first column",
    "we give the reference for the @xmath2 @xmath6 amplitude that we used to fit the @xmath89 model and in the second column we give the @xmath2 scattering length of that amplitude which has been used to construct the @xmath83 model .",
    "the third column gives @xmath36 using simple yamaguchi models for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions and it shows that even with these simple separable models the quasibound state only appears when @xmath97 is about 1.05 - 1.07 fm while in the multiple - scattering approaches of the previous section it appeared already with @xmath98 0.6 - 0.9 fm .",
    "the fourth column gives the results of the yamaguchi model for the @xmath2 amplitude and the pest model for the @xmath3 amplitude and it shows that the @xmath3 short - range repulsion also works against quasibinding since it wipes out the quasibound state although the @xmath99 remains large .",
    "the fifth and sixth columns contain the results of the resonant model of the @xmath2 amplitude with yamaguchi and pest models for the @xmath3 interaction respectively , and they show that the attraction of the system is greatly reduced when one takes into account the resonant nature of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "notice , however , that experimentally the effects will be similar whether there is a quasibound state or not since in both cases there will be an enhancement of the cross section at threshold .",
    "we calculated the integrated elastic cross section of @xmath4 scattering in the region of the @xmath6 resonance for the six resonant models of the @xmath2 interaction given in table iii and the realistic pest potential for the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the results of the three - body model ( solid lines ) and of the impulse approximation ( dashed lines ) . at threshold ,",
    "the results of all the three - body models are about one order of magnitude larger than those of the impulse approximation while at higher energies they are 2 or 3 times smaller .",
    "the behavior of the cross section at threshold indicates that even though the quasibound state is not present , the interaction in this region is very strong since it enhances the impulse approximation result by about one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , a signal of this behavior may appear also in other processes where there is an @xmath2 final state like the @xmath100 reaction where a large enhancement in the cross section has been observed in the region near threshold @xcite .    in order to illustrate the effect of the strong @xmath4 interaction in the reaction @xmath101 we will estimate the enhancement of the @xmath100 cross section at threshold due to the @xmath4 rescattering .",
    "we write the amplitude of the process @xmath102 as    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the amplitude of the @xmath102 process without @xmath4 rescattering , @xmath105 is the two - body lippmann - schwinger propagator of the intermediate @xmath4 state , and @xmath106 is the half - off - shell t - matrix of the elastic @xmath4 process . if we introduce the @xmath4 elastic - scattering amplitude @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the @xmath4 reduced mass , then at threshold , eq .",

    "( [ eq10 ] ) with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the enhancement factor of the @xmath102 cross section due to @xmath4 rescattering is    @xmath112    the amplitude @xmath104 of the @xmath102 process without @xmath4 rescattering is presumably given by meson exchanges such as @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath1 followed by the excitation and decay of the @xmath6 resonance @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the production operator without @xmath4 rescattering is not so important since in our estimate of the enhancement factor given by eq .",
    "( [ eq49 ] ) only the ratio @xmath115 enters .",
    "therefore , we take for it the @xmath1-exchange amplitude generated by our three - body model , i.e. ,    @xmath116    where @xmath34 and @xmath117 is the momentum corresponding to an initial @xmath3 state . using the models 1 - 6 of fig .",
    "2 , taken from references @xcite and included in table iv , we obtained the enhancement factors @xmath118 = 2.5 , 2.7 , 3.1 , 3.3 , 4.7 , and 5.1 respectively .",
    "these estimates are quite comparable to the enhancement factors observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in special for the 4 first models .",
    "recently , the experimental band for the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath52 has been pushed towards larger values for its real part @xcite .",
    "for those larger values , the @xmath2 models not generated directly from an integral equation , which would fix naturally their off - energy - shell behavior needed in three - body calculations , predict a quasi - bound @xmath119 state . if instead , the new data is used to generate @xmath1n t - matrices calculated from a potential and an integral equation , our results indicate that a realistic nn interaction , like the paris potential , through its short - range correlations , prevents the existence of the bound - state , independently of the @xmath1n models , provided they have been built dynamically .",
    "we confirmed then that the predictions of a @xmath120 eta - mesic nucleus are crucially affected by the off - shell behavior of the underlying @xmath1-n models .",
    "importantly , however , is that even for an inexisting quasi - bound state , an exact three - body calculation for the multi - scattering series in the final state predicts a severe enhancement of the elastic @xmath4 cross - section in the narrow region from threshold to 5 - 10 mev above threshold .",
    "this result is independent of the @xmath2 two - body models .",
    "very likely , the enhancement predicted by the exact three body calculations is related to the one observed in the reactions @xmath101 @xcite and @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "we actually made an estimate of the enhancement of the cross section of @xmath101 due to the @xmath4 final state interaction .",
