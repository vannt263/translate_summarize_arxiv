    "these structures arise from the strong coupling of collective plasmon- and single electron - hole excitations . for large diameter nanowires ,",

    "in contrast to the tddft result and experimental data on alkali clusters @xcite , the nlhd model predicts a blue shift of the dipole plasmon frequency from @xmath62 value .",

    "[ fig : models ] ) . at @xmath73",
    " the absorption spectrum is dominated by two resonant structures .",
    "first is the bonding dipole plasmon ( dp ) indicated with blue dotted line in figure .",
    "it is formed from hybridization of the dipole plasmon modes of the individual nanowires .",
    "the second resonance indicated with black dotted line is formed by bonding quadrupole ( qp ) plasmon degenerated with higher order modes .",
    "it is slightly red shifted with respect to the surface plasmon frequency @xmath62 . at @xmath74 ,",
    "the dp merges into the degenerate mode and the spectrum evolves into that of the individual nanowire . as the junction width @xmath2 decreases , the dp shifts to lower frequencies because of the attractive interaction between the charges of opposite sign across the junction .",
    "along with red shift of the dp , the qp ( orange dotted line in figure ) splits from the degenerate mode , and shows the red shift with decreasing @xmath2 .    despite the overall similarity of the results obtained with smaller and larger diameter nanowires",
    "there are some notable differences primarily caused by finite size effect .",
    "the resonances are much better defined for the larger @xmath4  nm nanowire . in this case",
    "the width of the resonances is smaller and the structures due to the interaction between the plasmon and electron - hole pair excitations disappear . for @xmath56  nm nanowire , this interaction can even split the single plasmon peak into several lines . the red shift of the dp and qp modes with decreasing @xmath2 is more pronounced for the @xmath4  nm nanowire dimer .",
    "this is because of the scale ( @xmath75 ) invariance of the plasmonic properties of nanostructure in the quasistatic limit .    for junction widths below @xmath76",
    " , electron tunneling across the junction becomes important .",
    "the results obtained here for the nanowire dimer have much in common with those reported in quantum studies of touching spherical nanospheres @xcite , and in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the dp resonance progressively disappears and the charge transfer plasmon mode ( c1 ) emerges prior to the direct contact between the nanoparticles .",
    "c1 appears as a broad shallow low - frequency peak at positive @xmath77   , and evolves into a well  defined resonance at @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , because of electron tunneling , the qp mode continuously evolves into a higher order charge transfer plasmon mode c2 before direct contact between the nanowires .",
    "thus , already at positive @xmath2 the nanowires appear conductively connected showing characteristic charge transfer plasmon modes @xcite . for a dimer with well established conductive contact , the c1 and c2 modes experience a blue shift as also reported in classical calculations @xcite .    to obtain further insights into the effect of the tunneling through the junction we have calculated the electron density dynamics in the plasmonic dimer subjected to an incident @xmath3-polarized laser pulse resonant with lower ( dp or c1 ) plasmonic modes .",

    "the structure of the induced charges and fields are similar to previous classical results for coupled cylinders @xcite and also resembles much to the case of metal sphere dimer @xcite .",
    "the probability of tunnelling between nanowires is negligible and no current flows across the junction .",
    "note that the maximum dipole polarisation corresponds to the instant of time when the maximum charge separation has occurred and the currents inside nanoparticles are minimal .",
    "for the reduced width @xmath86   , very similar profiles for induced densities and fields are obtained .",
    "therefore , we do not show @xmath81 but focus on the induced current .",
    "the junction width is now sufficiently small to allow weak electron tunnelling between the nanoparticles .",
    "large optical field in the junction acts as large bias in the scanning tunneling microscope causing tunneling current across the junction.@xcite thus , the junction shows the _ resistive _ character with maximum current between nanowires reached at the maximum field and consequently at maximum induced dipole .",

    "the maximum dipole moment of the dimer corresponds to the oppositely charged nanowires .",

    "the increase of the slope @xmath91 when @xmath2 is reduced from @xmath92   to @xmath86   is because of the increase of the tunneling probability . for @xmath93   and @xmath72",

    "[ fig : snapshots](k ) , the clock - wise rotation of the @xmath94 $ ] curve implies that the current is retarded with respect to the field .",
    "the junction becomes conductive which is particularly apparent for @xmath72 .",

    "the tunneling is negligible .",
    "each cylinder responds on the self consistent field created by the incident radiation and the neighbour .",
    "the effects of nonlocal screening discussed for the single cylinder should _ a priori _ influence the optical response of the dimer as suggested with nlhd calculations @xcite and as inherently build in the tddft results . while the effect of tunneling is clearly seen with tddft calculations , revealing the role of the nonlocal screening requires comparison with classical results , in particular for the energies of the plasmonic modes . in this respect ,",

    "the accumulation of charges on the opposite sides of the junction leads to exaggerated coupling between nanowires resulting in diverging fields and too large number of resonances .",
    "similarly , for negative @xmath2 , the sharp edges of the junction , which are otherwise smeared out by the electron tunneling also result in too many hybridized resonances @xcite .",
    "the nlhd description is free from the @xmath72 divergence problem.@xcite the number of resonances remains small and the fields in the middle of the junction stay finite albeit too large .",

    "the nlhd also fails to smoothen out the transition from separated to overlapping regimes and gives an abrupt nonphysical transition .",
    "the number of modes is smaller than in the classical drude description , but still larger than what is obtained in tddft or qcm calculations .",
    "our final remark concerns the qp plasmon that evolves into the c2 charge transfer mode for negative @xmath2 .",
    "the associated resonances are much less pronounced in the tddft cross - section compared to model approaches .",

    "[ fig : linearresponse ] suggests that this quantum size effect is small .",
    "we thus tentatively attribute the weaker high order resonances as obtained in tddft to the effect of the smearing of the induced surface charge densities .",

    "a similar analysis can be performed for the nlhd model calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler](c ) for the case of @xmath4  nm nanowire dimer .",
    "the nlhd results appear at even higher frequencies than the classical drude calculations , in even stronger disagreement with the tddft than the classical model .",
    "the explanation for this is that nlhd artificially places the plasmon  induced screening charges at a position @xmath112   inside the metal surface .",
    "thus , the separation between screening charges @xmath113 in the nlhd model is larger than separation @xmath2 in pure local theory , and too large compared to the quantum result @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "this decreases the interaction and results in blue shifted dp modes compared to the classical model and tddft . if the dp dispersion is plotted as a function of effective junction width , agreement between nlhd , classical drude , and tddft results is obtained .",
    "the above results show that the tddft dispersion of the dp can be fully retrieved with local classical calculations .",
    "the main issue here is the size of the junction for which the calculations have to be performed . for geometry of the nanostructure",
    ", it seems convenient to define the surfaces of the objects as given by the jellium edges . in this case",
    "the width @xmath72 of the junction would correspond to continuous solid formed at the contact point , which is physically sound . on the other hand ,",
    "classical calculations have to be performed for the effective junction width given by the actual separation between the screening charges .",
    "these conclusions have direct implications for the ultimate limit of resolution of plasmonic rulers.@xcite    for the free - electron na surface , the screening charges are located at approximately @xmath107   ( @xmath114   ) outside the jellium edge ( surface atomic layer ) meaning that for a na  na junction , the effective junction width would be @xmath115   ( @xmath116   ) smaller than the physical junction width measured between the jellium edges ( surface atomic planes ) .",
    "this conclusion holds not only for the nanowire case considered here , but for any junctions between na surfaces . for silver and gold , analysis of the data on the blue shift of the dipole plasmon resonance in small clusters @xcite with eq .",
    "[ eq : redshift ] places the effective screening charges inside the jellium edge at @xmath117   for silver , and at approximately @xmath118   for gold .",
    "therefore , for an ag  ag ( au  au ) junctions , the effective junction width would be by @xmath119   ( @xmath120   ) larger than the physical junction width measured between the jellium edges and close to the junction width masured between the surface atomic planes .",
    "the use of the plasmon ruler relies on the universal dependence of the dp frequency on the scaled separation @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler](d ) we show the tddft and classical results for the dp frequency of the @xmath56 nm and @xmath4 nm nanowire dimers as function of the scaled separation @xmath121 .",
    "the tddft data for both nanowire dimer sizes nearly falls on the unique curve provided that the separations @xmath2 are sufficiently large that no tunneling occurs .",
    "this holds for @xmath2 larger than typically 2 lattice constants between surface atomic planes , which sets lower bound for the distances that can be actually measured with plasmon ruler .      in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented fully quantum mechanical study of the optical response of the plasmonic dimer formed by realistic size cylindrical nanowires .",
    "this system is also representative of interacting nanorods and is of relevance for sers , plasmon ruler , and plasmon transport applications .",
    "translational invariance allows to apply the time ",
    "dependent density functional theory for the plasmonic dimer of largest size considered so far in quantum calculations .",
    "we considered nanowires made of sodium which is a prototype for free - electron metal so that jellium model applies .",
    "the free - electron character of na valence electrons implies that its permittivity can be well described with drude model , as well as it is consistent with approximations behind the hydrodynamic approach to model the nonlocal character of the dielectric function .",
    "thus , this is the system of choice allowing to set the full quantum tddft benchmark results , and to use these results to test different theoretical approaches addressing plasmonic response of the strongly coupled objects .",
    "this was one of the central goals of the present work .",
    "we have found that for the small junction widths , the optical response is determined by the quantum tunneling of conduction electrons across the potential barrier separating the nanowires .",
    "a decreasing junction size leads to progressive attenuation of the plasmon modes of separated nanowires and the emergence of charge transfer plasmon modes of conductively coupled dimer .",
    "as this happens , the fields in the middle of the junction are screened .",
    "the maximal field enhancement moves from the middle to the external regions of the junction . in this distance range the classical local drude and nonlocal hydrodynamic model descriptions fail since they do not account for tunnelling . at variance",
    ", the quantum corrected model reproduces the tddft findings on a semi  quantitative level .    for large separations",
    "@xmath2 , the tunneling is negligible and the overall agreement between tddft , classical and the qcm results is good . thus the qcm performs well over the entire range of separations studied here . for large @xmath2",
    "the agreement between the classical and tddft results can be further improved by taking into account the shift of the plasmon - induced charge density with respect to the geometrical surface of the nanoparticle .",
    "the latter can be defined as the jellium edge as in the present work , or as the top most atomic layer at the surface .",
    "the effective junction width is then given by the separation of plasmon indicted charges at the opposite sides of the junction . indeed , this is the interaction between these charges that determines the hybridization and energies of the modes . introducing a simple distance correction into the classical calculations allows a full account of this non - local effect .",
    "this result has implications for the plasmon ruler concept and shows that care should be taken with respect to the definition of the separation which is actually measured .",
    "we hope that the results presented here contribute to the understanding of the role of quantum nonlocal effects in strongly coupled plasmonic systems , and help in elaborating efficient theoretical approaches for their prediction .",

    "<S> for instance , strong plasmonic enhancement of the local fields @xcite opens a route to numerous practical applications , such as surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) @xcite , optical nano - antennas @xcite allowing , for example , the control of radiation from single quantum emitters @xcite , or generation of extreme ultraviolet pulses by non - linear high harmonic generation @xcite . in nanoparticle assemblies </S>",
    "<S> , the hybridization of plasmonic modes can serve for guiding of the propagating fields @xcite , as well as it offers a way for rational engineering of desired optical response and local field profile.@xcite not only light harvesting and sensing properties can be thus greatly improved , but also the specific geometry dependence of the optical response can be used as plasmon ruler to determine the arrangement and nanoscale distances within chemical or biological species . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    significant advances in fabrication and manipulation techniques allow nowadays for precise control of the geometry of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in particular , for nanoparticle assemblies the size of the gap between the adjacent nanoparticles can be brought below one nanometer so that the electron tunneling across the junction becomes possible . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the plasmonic devices enter the quantum regime which represents a significant challenge for available theoretical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , most of the descriptions of the optical response are based on the solution of the classical maxwell equations where the nanoparticles are modeled with sharp surfaces and the quantum nature of electrons forming the screening charge is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> such effects as experimentally observed appearance of the charge transfer plasmon for conductively coupled particles prior to direct contact @xcite , or optical rectification @xcite can not be addressed within a classical framework . </S>",
    "<S> as shown with recent quantum calculations @xcite the main ingredients missing in the classical model are the spill out of conduction electrons outside the nanoparticle surfaces , and the finite spatial profile of the plasmon - induced screening charge . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a nonlocal dielectric functions @xcite can account for the latter effect , where the variation of electron density is smooth rather than infinitely sharp , as assumed in the classical local approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spill out of electrons outside the nanoparticle surfaces and associated tunneling across the narrow interparticle junctions requires special treatment .    in this respect , the data available on the coupled nanoparticle dimer is quite revealing . </S>",
    "<S> this is a prototypical system for plasmonic nanoparticle coupling , which has been extensively studied . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite theoretical studies based on the solution of the classical maxwell equations predict a discontinuous transition from the capacitively to conductively coupled particles . </S>",
    "<S> for vanishing junction size , the fields in the junction diverge and the plasmon modes experience diverging red shift as a result of the interaction between high charge densities induced at the opposite sides of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the charge transfer plasmon appears abruptly after the conductive contact . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the nonlocal calculations based on the hydrodynamic model @xcite have shown that because of the finite spatial profile of the plasmon - induced screening charge , the fields in the junction stay finite albeit large . </S>",
    "<S> the number of plasmon resonances and their frequency shift is much reduced compared to classical predictions . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it follows from the quantum treatments @xcite that for narrow junctions , electron tunneling can short circuit the junction and quench the plasmon - induced field enhancement . the nanoparticles appear conductively connected prior to direct contact , and the transition between the non - touching and conductive contact regimes is continuous . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the charge transfer plasmon associated with interparticle charge transfer @xcite progressively emerges in the optical response of the system , as has been fully confirmed in recent experiments.@xcite these quantum effects could be reproduced with quantum corrected model ( qcm ) @xcite that treats the junction between the nanoparticles as an effective medium allowing to account for the quantum effects within the classical local maxwell theory.@xcite    present situation is thus characterised by the experimental ability to create the structures with sub - nanometer characteristic scales and several sometimes controversial theoretical approaches to address the optical properties of such a nanostructures . while quantum calculations provide an _ a priori _ exact answer to the problem , to date the application of rigorous quantum mechanical approaches to coupled plasmonic systems </S>",
    "<S> have been limited to rather small systems and are extremely heavy numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of considerable interest to have a bench mark quantum results on possibly large realistic system of coupled plasmonic particles allowing detailed comparison between full quantum and macroscopic maxwell theories . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow to assess of the role of quantum mechanical effects and of the possibility to account for these effects in classical theory . in this article which concerns a strongly coupled nanowire dimer </S>",
    "<S> , we offer such a comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quantum mechanical results for the optical response of the system can be quantitatively reproduced with simple models . </S>",
    "<S> _ local classical _ description of the system allows to account for the interparticle tunneling through the narrow junction and for the actual location of the dynamically induced screening charges . </S>"
