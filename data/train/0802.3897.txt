    "in 1998 , astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe was accelerating , not slowing down as expected  @xcite .",
    "this late - time acceleration of the universe is surely the most challenging problem in cosmology . within the framework of general relativity ( gr )",
    ", the acceleration originates from dark energy .",
    "the simplest option is the cosmological constant , first introduced by einstein .",
    "however , in order to explain the current acceleration of the universe , the required value of the cosmological constant must be incredibly small .",
    "particle physics predicts the existence of vacuum energy , but it is typically many orders of magnitude larger than the observed values of the cosmological constant ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , there could be no dark energy , but a large - distance modification to gr may account for the late - time acceleration of the universe  @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) . in order to realize the late - time acceleration ,",
    "it is necessary to modify gr at cosmological scales .",
    "it is really challenging to construct a consistent theory of modified gravity ( mg ) and progress in theoretical physics is required in order to have fully consistent models .",
    "even if successful theoretical models for mg are constructed , we need to distinguish them from dark energy models in gr via observations .",
    "this is indeed possible if one can combine various data sets which measure not only the expansion history of the universe but also the structure of the universe  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that by fine - tuning the properties of dark energy , it is always possible to mimic any mg model and hence it is impossible to distinguish between the two possibilities  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that it is indeed _",
    "possible _ to distinguish between mg models and dark energy models , and we propose a consistency test of gr which enables us to distinguish between these two possibilities ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from large - scale structure in the universe ,",
    "we can measure three quantities .",
    "one is the density perturbation which can be measured from the galaxy distribution and cluster abundance .",
    "the second is the peculiar velocity which can be measured from the redshift distortions of the galaxy power spectrum and the internal dynamics of clusters and galaxies .",
    "finally , we can measure the lensing potential from weak lensing of galaxies and clusters .",
    "we construct a consistency equation in gr which can be written only in terms of these observables . in this way ,",
    "it is possible to avoid using specific mg models or parametrising mg models in order to test gr on cosmological scales .",
    "then we discuss how we can realize this test using actual observations in the future .",
    "the most difficult part of the consistency test is that all the quantities should be measured at the same time and at the same location .",
    "however , weak lensing only measures the integrated effects of the lensing potential at different redshifts and there is no simple way to reconstruct the lensing potential at a given redshift . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel way to overcome this problem by reconstructing the lensing power spectrum from measured matter perturbations at given redshifts .    before going into the construction of the consistency test",
    ", we first summarize the assumptions that we make in this paper .",
    "first of all , we assume the cosmological principle and describe our background universe as an isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "thus we do not consider the possibility of an inhomogeneous universe which has been extensively studied in the literature as a possible explanation for the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the cosmological principle can be tested from observations @xcite and we assume that we can use this to exclude the inhomogeneous universe .",
    "next , we assume that the energy - momentum tensor for dark matter and baryons is conserved . in mg models ,",
    "we try to explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe without introducing any exotic fluids , so this is a reasonable assumption . in dark energy models ,",
    "dark matter can be coupled to dark energy ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , coupling between baryons and dark energy is strongly constrained by local experiments .",
    "thus only the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for dark matter can be broken .",
    "this creates a difference between peculiar velocities of dark matter and baryons , which can be tested from observations",
    ". this test will be investigated in a forthcoming paper @xcite and we assume that we can use this to exclude the possibility of the breakdown of energy - momentum conservation for dark matter .",
    "the final assumption is that mg models are metric theories and there exists a newtonian limit of the theory .",
    "this is necessary to reproduce the very tight constraints on deviations from gr at solar system scales . with this assumption , on subhorizon scales , only the time - time component and the anisotropic part of the space - space component of the modified einstein equations for perturbations",
    "are important . from the bianchi identity and the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor",
    ", other components of the modified einstein equations should be trivially satisfied .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize the basic equations for background cosmology and perturbations in gr and mg . in section iii ,",
    "the consistency test of gr is constructed , written only in terms of observables .",
    "we provide a set of consistency equations depending on the assumptions for the properties of dark energy in gr . in section iv , we propose a method to perform the test by reconstructing the weak lensing power spectrum from measured matter perturbations .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in gr , the friedman equation determines the expansion rate of the universe @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the matter energy density which include both dark matter , and baryon and the dark energy density @xmath2 accounts for the late - time acceleration of the universe .    on the other hand , in mg models",
    ", the expansion is determined by a modified friedman equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a function determined by the underlying modified theory of gravity .",
    "we can always rewrite this modified friedman equation as @xmath5    for a given mg model , it is always possible to find a dark energy model which gives exactly the same expansion history , i.e. the same @xmath6 .",
    "this gives the relation between total energy densities in two models as @xmath7 .",
    "we use the newtonian gauge to describe the metric perturbations @xmath8 the density fluctuation is defined by @xmath9 for each component of matter where the quantities with bar denotes the background quantity .",
    "the divergence of the peculiar velocity is @xmath10 . in gr ,",
    "the perturbed einstein equations at sub - horizon scales give @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an anisotropic stress .",
    "the quantity with the subscript t is the total contribution from matter perturbations @xmath13 as explained in the introduction , we assume that there is no interaction between dark energy and dark matter / baryons",
    ". then conservation of the energy - momentum tensor gives @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pressure perturbation of the dark energy fluid .",
    "assuming a newtonian limit in the mg model , the modified einstein equations yield the following equations @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 should be determined by the modified theory of gravity . in the mg model",
    ", we have only dark matter ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and the conservation equations are given by eq .",
    "( [ conmatter ] ) .",
    "all other components of modified einstein equations should be satisfied trivially thanks to the bianchi identity .",
    "first , let us consider simple dark energy models like quintessence , where we can safely ignore clustering of dark energy , at least under horizon scales . in this case ,",
    "the metric perturbations are given by @xmath22 in the gr dark energy model .",
    "in reality there is no direct measurement of the curvature perturbation @xmath23 .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing provides the combination @xmath24 which determines the geodesics of photons .",
    "then we can define a consistency parameter as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the newton constant measured by local experiments . if gr holds , @xmath27 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an early attempt to test gr from large - scale structure and gravitational lensing ) .",
    "we emphasize that all quantities in the consistency relation are observables and we do not need to assume any theory .",
    "it is easy to see that unless @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 in mg",
    ". we should emphasize that this test can allow a special class of mg with @xmath28 to pass the gr consistency test @xmath27 .",
    "however , if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 , which means that the gr relation @xmath32 is modified . in order to check this , we need one more equation which relates the newtonian potential @xmath33 to matter - energy perturbations . since energy - momentum is conserved , the continuity equation for matter is not altered and eq .",
    "( [ conmatter ] ) gives @xmath34 .",
    "then we define a consistency parameter for @xmath31 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 can be constructed by direct measurements of the peculiar velocity and acceleration of matter .",
    "we should emphasize that only energy - momentum conservation for dark matter is used .",
    "thus even if there is a peculiar velocity of dark energy @xmath38 , the reconstruction of the newtonian potential is not affected .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath39 , we can conclude that there is no modification of gr and dark energy has no clustering .",
    "however , even if one finds @xmath29 or @xmath40 , this does not give definite evidence for the breakdown of gr .",
    "in general , dark energy can have non - trivial clustering .",
    "in fact , the conservation equations for dark energy perturbations are not closed and the pressure perturbation @xmath16 and the anisotropic stress @xmath41 should be determined by the microphysics of the dark energy fluid . given that we do not know the origin of dark energy , we can treat these two functions as arbitrary functions .",
    "then it is always possible to mimic @xmath23 and @xmath33 in a mg model by tuning @xmath16 and @xmath41 in a dark energy model in gr , because @xmath42 mimics @xmath43 and @xmath41 mimics @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this fact can be clearly seen by rewriting poisson s equation in gr with clustering de as @xmath45 then , if we only observe dark matter fluctuations @xmath46 , we can not distinguish between clustering de and modified gravity as the clustering de mimics the modification of newton s constant @xmath47 thus if we find @xmath29 and @xmath40 , there are still two possibilities .",
    "one is mg and the other is dark energy model with non - trivial clustering .",
    "however , this argument is clearly based on the assumption that we only observe the clustering of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "once the dark energy clusters like dark matter , both perturbations participate in forming halos and thus galaxies .",
    "thus the galaxy distribution should trace the total matter perturbations , which are the sum of the dark matter and dark energy perturbations . in the same way ,",
    "the cluster abundance is sensitive to the total matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "when we measure the total matter perturbations from the galaxy distribution , bias between the galaxy density fluctuations and the total matter perturbations becomes the main issue . in this paper",
    ", we assume that bias can be measured independently by higher order statistics or other methods .",
    "we will come back to this issue in the conclusions .",
    "assuming we can measure the total density perturbations from observations , it becomes possible to improve the consistency test and we can distinguish clustering dark energy and modified gravity . including the dark energy perturbations , poisson s equation is now written as @xmath48 in the gr dark energy model , and @xmath49 in mg models .",
    "let us consider two models that give the same @xmath50 . in these two models , @xmath51 .",
    "then the relation between total density perturbations in the two models is @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the effective newton constant determined by the background friedman equation ( [ mgfr ] ) and @xmath18 is the effective newton constant determined by the poisson equation ( [ mgpo ] ) .",
    "in general these two effective newton constants are different , as is seen in explicit examples like the dgp @xcite and @xmath54 gravity models @xcite .",
    "we expect that this is a very general feature of mg",
    ".    then we can define the consistency parameter as @xmath55 in gr , @xmath56 . the total energy density @xmath57 is reconstructed from @xmath6 using the friedman equation in gr , eq .",
    "( [ frgr ] ) . in this case",
    ", we can not assume the gr relation @xmath58 and we should combine weak lensing that measures @xmath59 and peculiar velocity that determines @xmath33",
    ". then the consistency parameter is given by [ eq : grcon ] ^(2)(a , * k * ) = ( ) . again all the quantities in this equation can be measured from observations and we do not need to assume any theory to perform the test . from eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) and using the fact that in clustering de and mg , @xmath59 , @xmath37 and @xmath6 are the same , we find @xmath60 in mg models .",
    "this test ( [ eq : grcon ] ) is essentially the same as the consistency relation proposed in @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that this consistency relation is a test of the difference between the newton constants for the background cosmology and for sub - horizon perturbations .",
    "all observables in the consistency test should be measured at the same time and at the same location . however , in reality , there is no simple method to compare the statistical observables @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath37 in the consistency equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : grcon ] ) .",
    "this is because weak lensing is an integrated effect of the lensing potential determined by @xmath59 along the line of sight and it is impossible to reconstruct the lensing potential at a given redshift . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel way to accomplish the test using the projected power spectrum ( see @xcite for a review of the projected power spectrum ) .    the projected angular power spectra @xmath62 of any pair of perturbations @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by [ eq : cldd ] c_^xx=ddd w^x(d ) w^x(d ) _ , where @xmath65 is the comoving distance and we used the limber approximation which is valid for large @xmath66 .",

    "one of the most promising ways is to use the redshift distortions .",
    "even though the clustering of galaxies in real space to have no preferred direction , galaxy maps in redshift space show an anisotropic distribution due to the peculiar velocities of galaxies .",

    "this is one of the major systematic errors in the second test and we should probably wait for the surveys like ska to achieve sub @xmath137 accuracy .",

    "we have shown that this test probes the difference between the newton constants in the background cosmology and in large - scale structure .",
    "the main obstacle in realizing this test was that we should measure all the quantities in the consistency test at the same time and in the same location .",

    ", we have shown that , given the assumptions ( i ) the cosmological principle , ( ii ) energy - momentum conservation for dark matter and baryon , ( iii ) existence of a newtonian limit in the mg model , we can test general relativity only by using the measured quantities from the background expansion history and large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "we should also emphasize that there exist independent ways to test these assumptions from observations .",

    "<S> the breakdown of this consistency relation implies that the newton constant which governs large - scale structure is different from that in the background cosmology , which is a typical feature in modified gravity models . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method to perform this test by reconstructing the weak lensing spectrum from measured density perturbations and peculiar velocities . </S>",
    "<S> this reconstruction relies on poisson s equation in gr to convert the density perturbations to the lensing potential . </S>",
    "<S> hence any inconsistency between the reconstructed lensing spectrum and the measured lensing spectrum indicates the failure of gr on cosmological scales . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulties in performing this test using actual observations are discussed . </S>"
