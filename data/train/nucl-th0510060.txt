    "in recent years , shell - model calculations employing realistic effective interactions derived from modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potentials have produced results in remarkably good agreement with experimental data for a number of nuclei in various mass regions .",
    "a main difficulty encountered in this kind of calculations is the short - range repulsion contained in the bare @xmath0 potential @xmath3 , which prevents its direct use in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this difficulty is usually overcome by resorting to the well - known brueckner @xmath2-matrix method .",
    "recently , a new approach has been proposed @xcite which consists in deriving from @xmath3 a low - momentum potential @xmath1 defined within a given cutoff momentum @xmath4 .",
    "this is a smooth potential which can be used directly to derive the shell - model effective interaction @xmath5 .",
    "we have performed shell - model calculations @xcite using this method as well as the traditional @xmath2-matrix one .",
    "comparison of the results has shown that the former provides an advantageous alternative to the latter .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give a brief survey of the practical application of the @xmath1 approach in realistic shell - model calculations . in section 2",
    "we give an outline of the derivation of @xmath1 and @xmath5 , while in section 3 we show a few selected results of our current study of nuclei around doubly magic @xmath6sn , which have been obtained starting from the cd - bonn @xmath0 potential @xcite . in section 4",
    "we present some preliminary results of a study performed with different phase - shift equivalent @xmath0 potentials and examine their dependence on the choice of @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , we  smooth out \" the strong repulsive core contained in the bare @xmath0 potential @xmath3 by constructing a low - momentum potential @xmath1 .",
    "this is achieved by integrating out the high - momentum modes of @xmath3 down to a cutoff momentum @xmath4 .",
    "this integration is carried out with the requirement that the deuteron binding energy and low - energy phase shifts of @xmath3 are preserved by @xmath1 .",
    "this requirementy may be satisfied by the following @xmath7-matrix equivalence approach .",
    "we start from the half - on - shell @xmath7 matrix for @xmath3 @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes the principal value and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 stand for the relative momenta .",
    "the effective low - momentum @xmath7 matrix is then defined by @xmath12    where the intermediate state momentum @xmath11 is integrated from 0 to the momentum space cutoff @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "the above @xmath7 matrices are required to satisfy the condition @xmath14 the above equations define the effective low - momentum interaction @xmath1 , and it has been shown @xcite that they are satisfied by the solution : @xmath15 which is the well known kuo - lee - ratcliff ( klr ) folded - diagram expansion @xcite , originally designed for constructing shell - model effective interactions . in the above equation @xmath16 is an irreducible vertex function whose intermediate states are all beyond @xmath4 and @xmath17 is obtained by removing from @xmath16 its terms first order in the interaction @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the preservation of the half - on - shell @xmath7 matrix , which implies preservation of the phase shifts , this @xmath1 preserves the deuteron binding energy , since eigenvalues are preserved by the klr effective interaction . for any value of @xmath4 , the low - momentum effective interaction of equation ( 4 ) can be calculated very accurately using iteration methods .",
    "our calculation of @xmath1 is performed by employing the iteration method proposed in @xcite , which is based on the lee - suzuki similarity transformation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 given by the @xmath7-matrix equivalence approach mentioned above is not hermitian .",
    "therefore , an additional transformation is needed to make it hermitian . to this end",
    ", we resort to the hermitization procedure suggested in @xcite , which makes use of the cholesky decomposition of symmetric positive definite matrices . in a very recent paper @xcite it has been shown that the @xmath1 obtained through this method belongs to a family of hermitian low - momentum @xmath0 interactions which preserve the deuteron binding energy and are phase shift equivalent , all reproducing empirical phase shifts up to the cutoff momentum @xmath4 . from a comparison of shell - model matrix elements calculated with hermitian @xmath1 s given by various methods",
    "it has turned out @xcite that they are approximately equivalent to each other .",
    "having outlined the derivation of the low - momentum interaction @xmath1 from @xmath3 , we turn now to shell - model calculations in which we use @xmath1 as the input interaction .",
    "we derive the model space effective interaction @xmath5 by employing a folded - diagram method , which has been successfully applied to many nuclei @xcite using @xmath2-matrix interactions . since @xmath1 is already a smooth potential , it is no longer necessary to calculate the @xmath2 matrix .",
    "we therefore perform shell - model calculations following the same procedure as described , for instance , in @xcite , except that the @xmath2 matrix used there is replaced by @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we first calculate the @xmath16-box including diagrams up to second order in @xmath1 .",
    "the shell - model effective interaction is then obtained by summing up the @xmath16-box folded diagram series using the lee - suzuki iteration method @xcite .",
    "shell - model studies of neutron - rich nuclei in the close vicinity to doubly magic @xmath6sn offer the opportunity to test the matrix elements of the effective interaction well away from the valley of stability .",
    "we have recently studied @xcite several of these nuclei using as input interaction the @xmath1 derived from the cd - bonn @xmath0 potential .",
    "we report here some selected results of our current study of nuclei with valence neutrons in the 82 - 126 shell , focusing attention on @xmath18sn .",
    "this is the heaviest sn isotope for which some experimental information on excited states is presently available .    in our calculation",
    "we let the two valence neutrons occupy the six single - particle levels @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 of the 82 - 126 shell .",
    "as regards the single - neutron energies , they have been taken from the experimental spectrum of @xmath25sn , except that relative to the @xmath26 level which has not been observed .",
    "the latter has been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where all the adopted values are also reported . in this connection",
    ", it should be mentioned that the calculations performed in this previous work differ from the present ones mainly because we used there the @xmath2-matrix formalism .",
    "the results presented in this section have all been obtained with a @xmath1 derived from the cd - bonn @xmath0 potential and confined within a cutoff momentum @xmath4 = 2.1 @xmath27 .",
    "this value has been chosen according to the criterion discussed in @xcite .",
    "sn . ]    from figure 1",
    "we see that the calculated spectrum of @xmath18sn is in good agreement with the existing experimental data @xcite . in figure 2",
    "we compare with experiment our values of the excitation energy of the @xmath28 state for the three isotopes @xmath29sn , @xmath30sn and @xmath18sn . the experimental value for @xmath6sn is also reported to show the trend across the @xmath31 magic number .",
    "the neutron single - hole energies used in the calculations for @xmath29sn and @xmath30sn are the same as those adopted in our recent study @xcite of @xmath32 in and @xmath32sb .",
    "very recently @xcite , the @xmath33 values in @xmath6sn and @xmath18sn have been measured using coulomb excitation of neutron - rich radioactive ion beams .",
    "we have calculated this @xmath34 for @xmath18sn with an effective neutron charge of @xmath35 , according to our early study @xcite .",
    "the experimental and theoretical values are shown in figure 3 , where we also compare with experiment @xcite our @xmath33 values for @xmath29sn and @xmath30sn calculated with an effective neutron - hole charge of @xmath36 @xcite .    from figures 2 and 3",
    "we see that our calculations reproduce remarkably well the trend of both the first excited state and the @xmath33 across the @xmath31 magic number .",
    "excited state in sn isotopes around @xmath6sn .",
    "the calculated results are represented by circles and the experimental data by triangles . ]     for sn isotopes around @xmath6sn . ]",
    "the @xmath0 potential @xmath1 is currently attracting much attention . on the one hand",
    ", it is being applied in various contexts , for instance in the study of few - body problems @xcite . on the other hand , its properties are being studied in detail , in particular as regards the dependence on the original potential model .",
    "in fact , there is evidence @xcite that @xmath1 s derived from different phase - shift equivalent potentials , such as cd - bonn , nijmegen @xcite , argonne @xmath37 ( av18 ) @xcite , are nearly identical .",
    "we are currently investigating @xcite the dependence of nuclear structure results on the @xmath0 potential used to derive the shell - model effective interaction through the @xmath1 approach . here",
    "we present some preliminary results obtained for the nucleus with two valence protons @xmath18te , which provides a good testing ground for this investigation .",
    "we consider the three phase - shift equivalent @xmath0 potentials nijmegenii , av18 and cd - bonn . as regards the cutoff @xmath4 , we let it vary from 1.5 to 2.5 @xmath38 . in all cases",
    "we compare the calculated spectrum of @xmath18te with the experimental one up to about 4.5 mev excitation energy ( this includes sixsteen excited states ) and calculate the @xmath39 deviation @xmath40^{2}\\}^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath41 is the number of data points . ] .      in figure 4",
    "we show the behavior of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath4 for the three potentials .",
    "we see that the curves relative to nijmegenii ( nijmii ) and av18 practically overlap each other while that for the cd - bonn potential has a rather different pattern .",
    "in particular , the minimum of @xmath40 for cd - bonn is at @xmath42 while for the other two potentials it lies at @xmath43 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath40 for the three potentials is however almost equal and also the energies of the various states are practically the same . by way of illustration , we report in table 1 the ground - state energy of @xmath18te ( relative to doubly magic @xmath6sn ) and the excitation energies of the first three positive - parity yrast states .       from figure 4",
    "it also appears that all three curves are rather flat around the minimum . as a consequence ,",
    "the quality of agreement between theory and experiment does not change significantly for moderate changes in the value of @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , for the cd - bonn potential @xmath40 remains below 150 kev for values of @xmath4 between 1.5 and 1.9 @xmath27 while for the other two potentials this occurs for @xmath4 between 1.8 and 2.2 @xmath27 .",
    "the main conclusion of this preliminary study is that , allowing for limited changes in the value of @xmath4 , nuclear structure results obtained from @xmath1 s extracted from different @xmath0 potentials are practically independent of the input potential .",
    "it therefore appears that the low - momentum interaction @xmath1 gives an approximately unique representation of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "this is quite in line with the conclusions of @xcite .    at this point ,",
    "a comment on the results presented in this section is in order . as mentioned in section 2 , we include in the @xmath16-box all diagrams up to second order in @xmath1 . in the calculation of these diagrams we have inserted intermediate states composed of particle and hole states restricted to the two major shells above and below the fermi surface .",
    "however , as a development of our study , we are currently investigating the effect of increasing the number of intermediate states .",
    "the first results indicate that the minimum value of @xmath40 occurs at values of @xmath4 which are somewhat larger than those reported here .",
    "our final findings will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
