    "the modelling of molecular motors found great interest recently @xcite .",
    "the aim is the understanding of the working of molecular motors , where motor proteins perform unidirectional motion on structures having potentials without inversion symmetry .",
    "several processes were proposed that may lead to unidirectional motion of particles in such potentials .",
    "one process is a switching of the potential between different states , which may be caused by chemical reactions @xcite . to understand the working of molecular motors in principle , simplified models are desired which are amenable to explicit calculations . in this note we present a very simple hopping model for unidirectional motion , which includes switching of the hopping potential between two states . due to its simplicity",
    ", all quantities of interest can be calculated explicitly .",
    "recently two other simplified hopping models for molecular motors were introduced .",
    "schimansky - geier et al .",
    "@xcite considered chains of segments that can switch either individually or collectively between two states .",
    "the segments consist of three sites with a non - symmetric arrangement of hopping rates in one state and uniform hopping rates in the other state .",
    "kolomeisky and widom @xcite studied a model with coherent switching between two periodic non - symmetric potentials . in each potential only downward transitions are allowed ; consequently the motion of a particle comes to rest in each state in the absence of switching events .",
    "our model is simpler than the model of schimansky - geier in that the segments have only length 2 . we restrict the derivations to coherent switching between two states .",
    "the model is also different from the one of kolomeisky and widom in that it includes diffusion of the particle in the two states ; unidirectional motion is then brought about by the state changes .",
    "we restrict in this note the derivations to the stationary state with a unidirectional particle current ; also we do not intend to model real molecular motors with our simplified model . in the following section the model",
    "is formulated in terms of its master equations . in section",
    "iii the stationary current is calculated .",
    "the case with an additional uniform bias is treated in sec.iv .",
    "the question of the validity of the einstein relation between mobility and diffusion coefficient is addressed in sec .",
    "v. section vi presents a derivation of the power input and the power output when the systems performs work against the uniform bias field .",
    "section vii contains concluding remarks .",
    "the model consists of a linear chain with sites to which hopping rates to the neighbor sites are associated .",
    "the chain exists in two different states with different hopping rates .",
    "the model is pictorially represented in fig.1 where the hopping rates are visualized by potentials . in the state",
    "( 1 ) with an asymmetric potential , the sites with rates @xmath0 are designated by @xmath1 , and the ones with @xmath2 by @xmath3 .",
    "the transition to the other state ( 2 ) occurs in form of a poisson process with rate @xmath4 , and a particle on a site of type @xmath1 or @xmath3 is transferred to a site designated by @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . in the second state with",
    "uniform potential all sites have transition rates @xmath7 to the neighbor sites .",
    "the reverse transition to the non - symmetric state occurs with the same rate @xmath4 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions will be imposed on the system . to derive the current ,",
    "it is sufficient to take a period 2 .",
    "displacements of the particle , however , have to be counted in the extended potentials .",
    "let @xmath8 be the probability of finding the particle in any of the sites of type @xmath1 in the chain in state ( 1 ) .",
    "the probabilities @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined analogously .",
    "the probabilities fulfill the master equations @xmath12 the initial conditions are of no interest for the stationary state .",
    "the sum of the four equation shows that the time derivative of the sum of the four probabilities vanishes .",
    "hence @xmath13 .",
    "the sum of the first and the second master equation , and the sum of the third and fourth equation lead to the system of equations @xmath14 this set of equations shows that the state changes occur with rate @xmath4 .",
    "the stationary solution of these equations is @xmath15 where we have also used the normalization of the sum of all probabilities .",
    "the current from sites of type @xmath1 to @xmath3 , or from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , respectively , in the positive direction is given by @xmath16 the current from @xmath3 to @xmath1 , or from @xmath6 to @xmath5 , respectively , in the positive direction is given by @xmath17 in the stationary situation , the two currents are equal , @xmath18 . equating eqs.([j21 ] ) and ( [ j12 ] ) and using the stationary values for the sums @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we obtain an equation relating the differences @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 we find a second equation by subtracting the fourth from the third equation of the set ( [ me ] ) , @xmath24 the set of the two equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for the two differences is readily solved .",
    "we proceed directly to the stationary current , which follows from the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ j21 ] ) and ( [ j12 ] ) by inserting the differences , and the stationary values for the sums .",
    "the final result for the current is @xmath25 in the derivation of the current , there appears a term in the numerator proportional to @xmath26 , see also eq.([currb ] ) below .",
    "this term disappears due to the condition of detailed balance , which is valid within each of the two states of the chain .",
    "consequently , the current is proportional to @xmath4 for small @xmath4 , as it should be .",
    "we point out that the condition of detailed balance is fulfilled within each of the two states . the introduction of the state change with the rate @xmath4 leads to a violation of the condition of detailed balance when the full system is considered .",
    "this violation is necessary for the working of the motor , cf .",
    "the discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "the result shows that a unidirectional current exists for finite values of the flip rate @xmath4 .",
    "figure 2 presents the result for a particular choice of the hopping rates on the chain , as a function of the flip rate @xmath4 .",
    "the figure also contains the results of numerical simulations of the model .",
    "the current saturates for @xmath27 to the value @xmath28 from the continuum models with asymmetric potentials one expects that the unidirectional current is maximal for an optimal flip rate and vanishes in the limit of infinite flip rate .",
    "the saturation of the current at infinite flip rate is an artifact of our hopping model with only two sites .",
    "the model would correspond , in a continuum version , to a model containing sections with infinite slope in the potential .",
    "models with at least three sites are required to remove the artifact of saturation .",
    "for instance , the model of schimansky - geier et al .",
    "@xcite exhibits a maximum of the current as a function of the flip rate .",
    "the vanishing of the current in the limit of infinite flip rate , however , requires the presence of infinitely many sites in a segment , i.e. , the continuum limit .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the influence of a uniform bias on the unidirectional motion of the particle",
    ". then the system has to work against the bias field and the question is which bias is sufficient to stop the motion completely .",
    "a bias is introduced by multiplying the transition rates in state ( 1 ) in positive direction by a factor @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the transition rates in negative direction by @xmath31 , @xmath32 . in the state ( 2 ) , the transition rates @xmath33 are multiplied by @xmath34 for the positive direction and @xmath31 for the negative direction .",
    "the bias factor is related to an external force @xmath35 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lattice constant which is usually set unity .",
    "the calculation of the stationary current is easily extended to the case with bias , using the modified transition rates as given above .",
    "the result is @xmath38    \\lbrace 2b^2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2    -2b^{-2}\\delta_1\\delta_2 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & ( b - b^{-1})\\gamma [ b(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2 )     + b^{-1}(\\delta_1+\\delta_2)]\\rbrace \\nonumber \\\\    & + & ( b+b^{-1})\\gamma \\gamma_f    [ b(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2 ) - b^{-1}(\\delta_1+\\delta_2 ) + 2(b - b^{-1})\\gamma ] \\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39    [ 2(b+b^{-1})\\gamma + \\gamma_f ] + 2(b+b^{-1})\\gamma \\gamma_f \\:.\\ ] ] the result ( [ curr ] ) is readily recovered for @xmath40 .",
    "the result for the stationary current as a function of the bias @xmath34 is presented in fig.3 , for one particular value of the flip rate @xmath4 .",
    "one notices that the current behaves almost linearly as a function of @xmath34 , for our choice of the parameters .",
    "the bias value where the current vanishes can be read from the figure .",
    "we note that this value is rather small .",
    "no analytic expression can be given because the condition @xmath41 corresponds to an equation of 6@xmath42 order in @xmath34 .",
    "the slope of the curve is given by @xmath43 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2\\delta ( b=1)^2}\\ : [ \\gamma \\gamma_f(4\\gamma    + \\gamma_f)(\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2-\\delta_1-\\delta_2)^2 ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the slope and the value of the current at @xmath40 , an approximate prediction for the value of @xmath34 where the current vanishes can be obtained .",
    "the slope of @xmath44 at @xmath40 gives a prediction for the linear mobility of a particle in the stationary situation , i.e. , the increase / decrease of its velocity due to the action of a driving force .",
    "the question arises whether the linear mobility @xmath45 can be related to a diffusion coefficient @xmath46 by the einstein relation @xmath47 .    to examine this question",
    ", we calculated the diffusion coefficient of a particle in the system from its asymptotic mean - square displacement where the squared displacement is subtracted , @xmath48 to derive the mean - square displacement , site probabilities have to be considered that are defined on a linear chain with @xmath49 sites , in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the master equations ( [ me ] ) are easily extended to include site indices .",
    "the derivation of the mean - square displacement is a standard procedure , see for instance @xcite or @xcite .",
    "because it is somewhat lengthy , it will not be reproduced here .",
    "the result for the asymptotic diffusion coefficient is @xmath51\\ ] ] the diffusion coefficient is identical to the first term of the linear mobility as given in eq.([slope ] ) .",
    "since the second term is missing , the einstein relation between mobility and diffusion coefficient does not hold here ( note that we are using units where @xmath52 ) .",
    "a violation of the einstein relation is not surprising for the driven non - equilibrium , although stationary , system that is considered here .",
    "we point out that the numerical difference between the mobility and the diffusion coefficient is rather small for the parameters chosen here , it is barely visible on the scales of figures @xmath5 or @xmath6",
    ".    two limiting cases of the diffusion coefficient are of interest .",
    "first , for small flip rates @xmath46 can be brought into the form @xmath53 this form of the diffusion coefficient follows from a two - state model where @xmath46 is deduced from a weighted superposition of the diffusion coefficients in state @xmath54 ( first term on the rhs of ( [ d0 ] ) ) and of the coefficient in state @xmath55 ( second term ) .",
    "since the flip rate is the same in both directions , the weights are @xmath56 , and the result that is obtained agrees with ( [ d0 ] ) and is independent of the flip rate .",
    "our derivations show that a two - state description is only applicable at small flip rates . for large flip rates , the diffusion coefficient saturates at @xmath57 we were not able to find a physical interpretation of this limiting behavior .",
    "we also performed monte carlo simulations of the mean - square displacement of particles about the stationary state .",
    "the number of particles and system size used in the simulation are respectively @xmath58 and @xmath6 with periodic boundary condition .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates that @xmath59 is indeed proportional to @xmath60 , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath46 can be deduced from the simulation results .",
    "the numerical results agree with the theoretical ones .",
    "in this section we calculate the power input when the system is switched between two states , with an additional bias acting on the particle , and the power output , i.e. , the work performed by the particle per unit time when it moves against the uniform bias .",
    "power is required to switch the system from the state with a uniform potential to the state with the non - symmetric potential . in our model , if a particle is on a site of type @xmath6 in the uniform potential at the time where the switching occurs , its energy will be raised when it finds itself on site type @xmath3 after the switching event .",
    "the energy follows from detailed balance in state @xmath55 , @xmath61    to obtain the power input , the average occupation of sites type @xmath6 at the switching event is required . to derive this quantity ,",
    "we consider the dynamics of the site occupation under the condition that the particle is remaining in state @xmath55 , or is remaining in state @xmath54 .",
    "the respective conditional probabilities , which will be called @xmath62 for state ( 1 ) and @xmath63 for state @xmath54 , obey analogous master equations as @xmath64 , cf .",

    "the above derivations were formally made for the case of no bias . a uniform bias is immediately included in the derivations if the transition rates @xmath75 are replaced by @xmath76 , and the transition rates @xmath77 by @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the final formulae will be considered for the case including bias .",
    "the power input is now obtained by multiplying the occupation of type @xmath6 sites at the flipping time with the flipping rate and the energy supplied in one flip .",
    "this energy has been given in eq.([detb ] ) in units of @xmath79 .",
    "hence the power input is , in units of inverse time @xmath80    the power output is obtained from the velocity induced by the switching process by multiplying it with the force .",
    "the force is obtained from the bias parameter as @xmath81 where the expression is dimensionless due to the division with @xmath79 and the use of lattice constant @xmath82 .",
    "since the velocity is related to the current by a factor @xmath3 in view of the normalization of @xmath1 particle in the reduced system with periodic boundary conditions , we have @xmath83 if the current for @xmath84 is negative for the choice of parameters used ( as it is the case here ) we compensate the sign by multiplying with @xmath85 . the current is obtained as a function of f from eq.([currb ] ) by using eq.([f ] ) .",
    "the power input , the power output and the efficiency of the motor , which is usually defined as the ratio of the power output to the input , are plotted in fig.5 , 6 and 7 respectively for three chosen flip rates as a function of the force acting on the system .",
    "the increment of the power input is so small that it can not be seen from the figure .",
    "for example , for @xmath86 the power input increases from @xmath87 to @xmath88 in the range of the force considered , from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "the efficiency of the model that is studied here is rather small .",
    "this is related to the fact that the unidirectional current vanishes already for small bias fields opposing the motion of the particles , cf .",
    "figs.@xmath5 and @xmath91 . in order to devise models that have a higher efficiency , more sites within a repeat unit are required , as well as proper adjustment of the parameters .",
    "in this paper we have presented a very simple model for a molecular motor where a particle moves unidirectionally in a hopping potential which is flipping between a state having a potential without inversion symmetry and a state with uniform potential .",
    "such models are intended to mimick motion of proteins in polar filaments @xcite .",
    "the appeal of the model , which comprises only two different types of sites in the non symmetric state , is that all quantities of interest can be calculated explicitly .",
    "we demonstrated this by calculating the stationary current with and without bias which results from the switching of the system between the two states , and by deriving the power input and output of the system .",
