    "the prospect of having ubiquitous high data - rate wireless services is leveraged by the versatility and portability of the communication devices that will form the nodes of future wireless networks .",
    "these devices will be able to perform various functions including sending , receiving and/or relaying data to other nodes .",
    "as such , it is expected that future wireless networks will not possess a predetermined topology , but rather an _",
    "ad hoc _ one that encompasses many existing and upcoming network structures including current and relay - aided cellular networks  @xcite .    given the stringent limitations on the spectrum available for wireless communications , providing high data - rate services banks on sharing the spectrum by multiple users which results in potentially significant interference .",
    "one option to mitigate interference is to use the orthogonal frequency division multiple access  ( ofdma ) technique , wherein a set of orthogonal narrow - band subcarriers are exclusively assigned to each user .",
    "this technique offers several advantages including design simplicity and resilience to frequency - selective fading . in spite of these advantages ,",
    "rate - effective utilization of the available spectrum may require the ofdma subcarriers to be used simultaneously , rather than exclusively , by multiple users .",
    "this is especially the case when the network is composed of essentially separated clusters . in contrast , for tightly coupled networks exclusive usage of subcarriers can be more beneficial from a rate perspective  @xcite ,  @xcite .    in order for a wireless network to be able to support the reliable communication of high data rates , the scarce resources available for the network",
    "must be carefully exploited .",
    "such resources include the spectrum available for communication , time , and the typically low power of the wireless nodes .",
    "proper exploitation of these resources involves choosing the optimal routes of the data flows , the optimal powers to be allocated by the nodes to each subcarrier , and the optimal scheduling and possibly duration over which the subcarriers are assigned to various links .",
    "although these tasks have traditionally been performed separately , they are interrelated and performing them in isolation may incur a significant loss in performance . to avoid the aforementioned drawback ,",
    "we devise a joint optimization framework that incorporates data routing , subcarrier scheduling and power allocation in the design of a generic multicarrier network .",
    "the network is generic in the sense that it possesses an _ ad hoc _ topology and its nodes can assume multiple roles simultaneously including being sources , destinations and/or relays .",
    "this framework is centralized , in the sense that the design is performed by a central entity that is aware of the network parameters .",
    "hence , this framework can be seen as a benchmark for distributed and potentially less comprehensive designs . in this framework",
    "each subcarrier can be reused by multiple links , and the nodes acting as relays operate in the half - duplex mode , i.e. , a node can not send and receive at the same time on the same subcarrier .",
    "the objective of the design is to maximize a weighted - sum of the rates injected and reliably communicated over the network .",
    "weights are assumed to be known _ a priori _ , but can be adapted over time to account for fairness issues and to maintain a desired quality of service .",
    "two instances of networks are considered . in the first instance , each subcarrier can be time - shared by multiple links , thereby resulting in continuous subcarrier scheduling variables .",
    "the role of these variables is to determine the fraction of time during which a subcarrier is used over a particular link .",
    "in contrast with the first instance , in the second one time - sharing is not allowed and a subcarrier , once assigned to a set of links , is used by those links throughout the signalling interval .",
    "this instance results in binary subcarrier schedules , which using a particular change of variables , are incorporated in the power allocation constraints .",
    "this results in a design problem that is significantly easier than its general counterpart considered in the first instance .",
    "it is worth noting that the first instance is a generalization not only of the second instance , but also of instances in which frequency - reuse is not permitted  @xcite . as such ,",
    "the framework considered in this instance offers significant performance advantages over currently available designs , but at the expense of increasing dimensionality and design complexity .",
    "this instance provides an inherent tradeoff between performance and design complexity ; the design complexity can be reduced by restricting the number of links that can reuse a particular subcarrier .",
    "the optimization problems arising from the joint design in both instances are nonconvex and hence difficult to solve . to overcome this difficulty , a logarithmic transformation is used to cast the original problem in a form that , for all but a few constraints , complies with the geometric programming  ( gp ) standard form  @xcite .",
    "the constraints that are not compatible with that form are approximated by monomial expressions that correspond to their first order taylor expansion around a given initial point  @xcite .",
    "using an exponential transformation , the resulting approximation can be cast in a convex form .",
    "a refinement of this approximation can be obtained by iterative updating of the initial point .",
    "in particular , we use the so - called iterative monomial approximation technique , wherein the solution of one convex approximation is used as the initial point in the following iteration . under relatively mild conditions ,",
    "this technique is guaranteed to yield a solution of the karush - kuhn - tucker  ( kkt ) system corresponding to the original problem  @xcite .",
    "numerical results show that the designs developed in both instances yield performance that is considerably superior to that of their counterparts in which frequency - reuse is not allowed . in comparison with currently available designs ,",
    "the ones presented herein are the first to attempt designing data routes , subcarrier schedules and power allocation jointly when the subcarriers are both time - shared and frequency - reused .",
    "in particular , the contributions in this paper include : 1 ) introducing the concept of simultaneous time - sharing and frequency - reuse of subcarriers ; 2 ) casting the joint design of data routes , subcarrier schedules and power allocation in a framework that is amenable to gp - based optimization ; 3 ) providing a simplified approach that enables mustering a considerable portion of the gains offered by the full joint design , but with a significantly lower complexity ; and 4 ) developing an efficient polynomial complexity algorithm for the special case in which the subcarriers can be frequency - reused but not time - shared .",
    "this work builds on the results obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , the exposition herein is more comprehensive and includes additional examples , a simplified approach and complexity analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ se : lit - rvw ] provides an overview of currently available design techniques .",
    "section  [ se : pro_stm ] explains the system model and design objective .",
    "section  [ se : rpc_w_time ] considers the joint design of data routes and power allocations when time - sharing of subcarriers is allowed .",
    "the complementary instance in which time - sharing is not allowed is addressed in section  [ se : rpc_w",
    "/ o_time ] .",
    "the complexity of the proposed algorithms are examined in section  [ se : comp ] .",
    "numerical results are provided in section  [ se : sim ] , and section  [ se : con ] concludes the paper . for completeness , the gp standard form and the monomial approximation technique",
    "are provided in appendix  [ se : gp_mon_def ] , and the derivation of the results pertaining to complexity is provided in appendix  [ se : slf - crdn ] .",
    "in this section we provide an overview of the currently available techniques for routing and resource allocation in wireless networks .",
    "a plethora of techniques is available for optimizing each aspect in isolation , but significantly fewer ones consider their optimization jointly .",
    "resource allocation in wireless networks constitutes the task of determining the power allocated for each transmission and the fraction of time over which a particular subcarrier is assigned to that transmission .",
    "instances in which resource allocation techniques were developed are provided in  @xcite for various network scenarios .",
    "for instance , power allocation techniques for single - carrier cellular systems and _ ad hoc _ multicarrier systems were developed in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . to enable more effective utilization of resources ,",
    "power allocations were optimized jointly with binary - constrained subcarrier schedules .",
    "for instance , the designs developed in  @xcite and  @xcite rely on the premise that each subcarrier is exclusively used by one node and the solutions obtained therein are potentially suboptimal .",
    "when the binary constraint on the subcarrier schedules is relaxed allowing the subcarriers to be time - shared by multiple nodes , the optimal power allocations can be shown to be the water - filling ones  @xcite ; a related problem was considered in  @xcite for a case in which the nodes experience self - noise .",
    "further improvement can be achieved by joint optimization of resource allocations and routing  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a method for obtaining jointly optimal routes and power allocations was developed in  @xcite for the case in which the nodes were restricted to use orthogonal channels for their transmissions . in a complementary fashion , the case in which the power allocations are fixed was considered in  @xcite .",
    "therein , a heuristic was developed for optimizing the data routes and subcarrier schedules jointly .",
    "capitalizing on the potential gains of incorporating power allocation jointly with data routing and subcarrier scheduling , the authors considered a generic network in which the nodes can assume multiple roles at the same time and each subcarrier could be either used exclusively by one link or time - shared by multiple links  @xcite .",
    "although the designs provided in  @xcite offer an effective means for exploiting the resources available for the network , these designs restrict the subcarriers to be used exclusively by only one link at any given time instant .",
    "such a restriction may not incur a significant performance loss in tightly coupled networks  @xcite , but in networks with clustered structures , this restriction can be quite harmful . for unclustered networks , frequency - reuse may result in a substantial increase in the interference levels .",
    "however , if properly exploited , frequency - reuse can yield valuable performance gains .",
    "the effect of frequency - reuse was considered in single - channel networks in  @xcite for the case in which the data rates are restricted to assume discrete values , and in  @xcite for the case in which the nodes use superposition coding .    in the current work",
    ", we will consider the joint optimization of power allocations , subcarrier schedules and data routes in the design of generic multicarrier networks with frequency - reuse , and with and without time - sharing .",
    "as such , these designs generalize currently available ones , and will subsequently offer a significant improvement over their performance .    a summary of this review and a comparison to our work is presented in table  [ tb : lit_rew ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ example 3 : ( average weighted - sum rate comparison ) _ in this example , we use monte carlo simulations to evaluate the average performance of the joint designs with and without time - sharing when the channels are time - varying rather than static as in examples  1 and  2 .",
    "we consider a network with @xmath0 nodes in which nodes 3 and 4 wish to communicate with nodes 2 and 1 , respectively , over @xmath1 subcarriers .",
    "the number of simultaneous transmissions is set to @xmath2 and the simulation results are averaged over 10 independent network realizations .",
    "the average weighted - sum rates yielded by the algorithms in sections  [ se : rpc_w / o_time_gp_alg ] and  [ se : rpc_w_time_gp_alg ] for the values of @xmath3 ranging from 0 to 30 dbm are depicted in figures  [ fig : w2 ] and  [ fig : w1 ] for the cases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these figures also provide a comparison with the weighted - sum rates yielded by the designs in which frequency - reuse is not considered  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : graph ] , the weighted - sum rate yielded by the joint design with both time - sharing and frequency - reuse outperforms the designs in which either time - sharing or frequency - reuse is exclusively considered , but at the expense of increased complexity .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : w1 ] suggests that , at the sum - rate of 12  b / s / hz , the proposed design with both time - sharing and frequency - reuse yields a power advantage of 4  dbm over the designs in which either time - sharing or frequency - reuse is exclusively considered and a power advantage of 8  dbm over the design in which neither of these techniques is considered .",
    "this figure also suggests that , for values of @xmath3 less than 15 dbm , the design with frequency - reuse but without time - sharing yields better performance than the design with time - sharing but without frequency - reuse in  @xcite .",
    "however , for values of @xmath3 higher than 15 dbm , the design with time - sharing but without frequency - reuse performs better than the one with frequency - reuse but without time - sharing .",
    "this phenomenon can be attributed to the effect of interference . at low powers , the effect of interference is small and frequency - reuse performs generally better than time - sharing . in contrast , at high powers , the effect of interference is more severe and time - sharing performs generally better than frequency - reuse .",
    "as expected , the design with neither time - sharing nor frequency - reuse has inferior performance .",

    "we consider a snapshot of a network with @xmath10 nodes and @xmath11 links ( links with a distance more than 150  m are neglected ) . in this",
    "network nodes 3 and 4 wish to communicate with nodes 2 and 1 , respectively , over @xmath12 subcarriers .",
    "the number of simultaneous transmissions is set to @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath14 , which results in @xmath15 with @xmath16 , 190 and 110 variables , respectively .",
    "the sum - rate yielded by the generalized algorithm with different values of @xmath17 is depicted in figure  [ fig : modified ] . for comparison",
    ", this figure also shows the rates yielded by the special case in section  [ se : rpc_w",
    "/ o_time ] .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : modified ] , the algorithm with @xmath14 and 3 yields rates that are slightly less than the rate yielded by the algorithm with @xmath18 , however with a significantly less computational complexity .",
    "in fact , the complexity of the algorithm with @xmath19 is polynomial , whereas that of the algorithm with @xmath18 is exponential in @xmath20 .",
    "this feature renders the algorithm with @xmath21 more attractive for designing large networks with potentially rapid channel variations . from figure",
    "[ fig : modified ] it can be seen that the gap between the rates yielded by different values of @xmath17 decreases as the power budget increases .",
    "this is because as power increases , interference becomes more severe , which causes the reuse of a particular subcarrier on multiple links less beneficial .",
    "it can be also seen from this figure that , most of the gain of frequency - reuse is mustered by only considering two or three simultaneous transmissions , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that increasing @xmath17 trades complexity for performance .",
    "in particular , as @xmath17 increases , the performance of the algorithm becomes closer to that of the one with @xmath18 , but at the expense of increased complexity .",

    "is shown for 80 random instances of feasible initial points , @xmath28^{lk}\\times [ 0,1]^{|\\gamma|}$ ] .",
