    "the primordial density perturbations which provide initial conditions for structure formation @xcite can be classified as two types : curvature and isocurvature .",
    "isocurvature perturbations are defined to be fluctuations in the composition of the energy density .",
    "hence , the curvature remains fixed while the relative contributions of various fluid elements composing the total energy density changes .",
    "more explicitly , the isocurvature perturbation due to a cold dark matter particle species @xmath2 can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of photons and @xmath5 is the density of the dark matter particles .",
    "as can be seen in the appendix , generically , isocurvature perturbations are almost always synonymous with entropy perturbations .",
    "although the isocurvature perturbations do not give rise to potential energy during radiation domination , after matter domination occurs , the isocurvature perturbations also become source for gravitational potential energy leaving an imprint on the cmb .    in the late 80 s and early 90 s , isocurvature and",
    "curvature perturbation models were seen to be competing models for the theory of initial conditions for structure formation . today , from the precise measurements of the cmb acoustic peaks and initial measurements of the te correlations @xcite , most people agree that the dominant contribution to the primordial density fluctuations arise from curvature perturbations .",
    "nonetheless , as demonstrated by many recent works @xcite , an order 10% contribution to the cmb power spectrum from isocurvature is possible .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we generically expect from theoretical considerations a nonvanishing contribution to the cmb from isocurvature perturbations .",
    "( in other words , whenever there is more than one energy component in the universe , there is always some amount of isocurvature perturbations . )    in the most popular wimp cdm ( cold dark matter ) picture in inflationary cosmology , the isocurvature perturbations are expected to be small because cdm abundance today is determined from a freeze out process starting from chemical equilibrium initial conditions . since the chemical equilibrium is with radiation , which , by definition , has overdensities defined by curvature fluctuations during radiation domination , cdm in this case will naturally have suppressed isocurvature component since @xmath6 where @xmath2 denotes the dark matter density , @xmath7 denotes radiation , and @xmath8 denotes the equilibrium temperature .",
    "however , for superheavy dark matter which never equilibrates , the isocurvature perturbations are generically not negligible .",
    "furthermore , because , for gravitational particle production scenario , the superheavy dark matter _ homogeneous _ density is determined by the same inflationary dynamics as the isocurvature perturbations themselves , one obtains a correlated constraint for the superheavy dark matter abundance and the isocurvature perturbation amplitude . in this paper",
    ", we compute the generic feature of this correlated constraint .",
    "the gravitational production of superheavy dark matter has been well studied in the past @xcite . in this scenario , the nonadiabatic change in the particle dispersion relationship due to a relatively sudden transition from a quasi - de sitter phase of inflation to a small power law expansion phase of frw cosmology causes particle production .",
    "the only non - generic feature of this dark matter scenario is the existence of stable particles with heavy mass . for @xmath9gev particles , up to dimension 8 decay operators needs to be absent to have the particle be long lived enough to be cdm .",
    "nonetheless , there are many particle physics and string theory motivated candidates for superheavy dark matter ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "hence , what makes this scenario exciting is that if we can measure the signatures of superheavy dark matter , we would have a probe of the very early universe where the physics far beyond the standard model of particle physics was important .",
    "( indeed , it may even probe string theory . )",
    "this paper serves as one step towards identifying the signature of superheavy dark matter on the cmb .",
    "in particular , we investigate how much superheavy dark matter isocurvature perturbations are produced at around 50 efolds before the end of inflation and how those isocurvature perturbations will show up on the cmb .",
    "we find that the mass of the superheavy dark matter can not be too small if one is to avoid overproducing isocurvature perturbations inconsistent with the cmb data .",
    "more specifically , the constraint is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass of the superheavy dark matter and @xmath12 is the hubble expansion rate at the end of inflation .",
    "one implication of this is to strengthen the preference of large tensor perturbations for gravitationally produced superheavy dark matter scenario .",
    "more specifically , if the reheating temperature is less than @xmath1 gev , then the tensor to scalar power ratio is bounded from below by @xmath13    another implication of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intromassbound ] ) is that there is a lower bound on the reheating temperature for superheavy dark matter scenario to be viable since the number density of particles produced falls off as @xmath14 and increasing the reheating temperature increases the final number density . putting this together with the bound on the tensor perturbations from inflation , we find the approximate requirement @xmath15 in order to have the superheavy dark matter be the cdm while not contributing too much to isocurvature perturbations where @xmath16 represents the bound on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbation power .",
    "hence , we have a severe restriction on this scenario coming from the gravitino bound ( see for example @xcite ) if this scenario is embedded in gravity mediate susy breaking scenario ( for an introductory review of status of low energy supersymmetry , see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "note that given that both the superheavy dark matter and the gravity waves are produced by inflationary energy density , it is natural that there is a bound of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : introreheatingbound ] ) . what is not obvious about eq .",
    "( [ eq : introreheatingbound ] ) is how the bound on isocurvature perturbations make eq.([eq : introreheatingbound ] ) independent of the mass of the superheavy dark matter .",
    "the explanation of this is one of the main results of this paper .    in the present work",
    ", we will consider superheavy dark matter model of massive scalar field @xmath2 minimally coupled to gravity without any other interaction for @xmath2 .",
    "the results are not likely to change drastically with fermionic superheavy dark matter since none of the physics relies upon the existence of a vacuum expectation value of the dark matter field nor spin statistics .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to minimal coupling in this paper . for any fixed dark matter",
    "mass , nonminimal coupling will change the total amount of dark matter produced , the spectral distribution of the dark matter , and the dark matter s stress tensor correlator .",
    "the most important effect is likely to come from the dark matter s stress tensor correlator . because a coupling of the form @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the ricci scalar ) effectively shifts the mass of the superheavy dark matter as @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the expansion rate during inflation )",
    ", a positive @xmath21 results will relax the mass bound shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intromassbound ] ) , possibly to an extent where there will be no constraint from isocurvature perturbations . on the other hand , a negative value for the nonminimal coupling will make the bound more stringent .",
    "the order of presentation is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we make general estimates to establish the results associated with eqs.([eq : intromassbound ] ) , ( [ eq : lowerboundongwave ] ) , and ( [ eq : introreheatingbound ] ) . following that , we review the basic physics of cmb and its relationship to isocurvature perturbations .",
    "we then compute the isocurvature power spectrum ( essentially stress tensor correlation function ) in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we present numerical results with a special emphasis on a particular inflationary model as a check of our general argument .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 . in the appendix",
    "a , we give an elementary thermodynamic discussion of isocurvature perturbations to remind the reader of its physics .",
    "the technical details of the particle production computation for the toy model used in section 5 is presented in appendix b.",
    "it is possible to semi - quantitatively describe the mass bound coming from isocurvature perturbations as follows .",
    "field fluctuations are typically characterized by its @xmath22-point moments , and the most elementary nontrivial moment for perturbative theories is typically the two point function .",
    "the power spectrum of any two point function in a translationally invariant space is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined to be @xmath25 . as we will discuss below , the isocurvature perturbations that we are concerned with",
    "are characterized by the power spectrum @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cdm ( superheavy dark matter in our case ) energy overdensity .    as an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we can represent the energy overdensity field as @xmath28 , which gives @xmath29 hence , in the long wavelength limit , we can approximate this as @xmath30    for scalar fields @xmath2 in frw spacetimes in general , if @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the scalar field potential and @xmath20 is the expansion rate ) , we know that the correlation function will behave as in flat minkowski space . in that case , we know from minkowski space field theory that the two point correlation functions receive most of its power from short distances .",
    "we also know that for long wavelengths ( @xmath33 ) in de sitter ( ds ) space , when @xmath34 , that @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the factor that is breaking scale invariance due to the fact that @xmath37 . ) is only valid when @xmath38 in the minimal coupling scenario . on the other hand , for nonminimal coupling",
    ", this form is valid only if @xmath39 . ] hence , using the minkowski intuition and the fact that there is generically large power contribution in the infrared for @xmath40 ( due to instability ) , we can estimate the power index of eq.([eq : powerspecform ] ) as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive order unity dimensionless number .",
    "we thus find @xmath43    since inflation eventually ends and since the gravitational particle production does not really `` occur '' until the end of inflation , we have to assign the time at which we evaluate the time dependent quantities carefully .",
    "since the isocurvature fluctuations are generated as the scales leave the horizon early in the inflationary epoch , we assign @xmath20 to the expansion rate at about 50 efoldings before the end of inflation . on the other hand",
    ", the scaling of the wave vector continues until the end of inflation at which time particles are nonadiabatically produced .",
    "after the nonadiabatic particle production occurs , the power spectrum should remain approximately time independent in the long wavelength limit owing to the arguments of causality and adiabatic evolution .",
    "hence , we write @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the expansion rate at about 50 efolds before the end of inflation and @xmath46 represents the cdm energy density at the end of inflation . in section 4",
    "we will compute this more carefully and find that although this gives the right order of magnitude , there is comparable contribution coming from the kinetic terms neglected in this estimate .    the dark matter energy that appears in the denominator of eq.([eq : orderofmag ] )",
    "is not easy to estimate for minimal coupling because significant particle production contribution comes from the infrared which have ambiguous vacuum boundary conditions . as shown in the appendix , neglecting this infrared contribution , one finds @xmath47 for @xmath48 potential .",
    "more generally , we expect that @xmath49 hence , we generically find @xmath50 where we have assumed @xmath51 consistently with the particle production .",
    "although naively , one would guess that the exponential would dominated on the right hand side of eq .",

    "since the isocurvature contribution must not exceed the adiabatic contribution to @xmath58 , we have for small @xmath59 @xmath60 which gives a bound of @xmath61 where @xmath62 is close to unity .",

    "since this is similar to the result of our more careful computation , we will use this bound as our example for the rest of this section .",
    "however , more generally , the bound is @xmath66 .",
    "now , according to our estimate of particle production shown in the appendix , the dark matter density today is given by @xmath67 this implies that if @xmath65 , we must increase the relic abundance by increasing @xmath11 from @xmath68gev while keeping the exponential fixed or increase @xmath69 or increase both @xmath11 and @xmath69 . note that @xmath12 dependence only comes through @xmath14",

    "this means that , if the superheavy dark matter scenario is embedded in supergravity models with gravity mediated susy breaking , the gravitino bound , which is typically an upper bound on the reheating temperature of about @xmath358 gev , strongly squeezes these models . if , for example , lhc data favors a gravity mediated susy breaking scenario in which the cascade of gravitino decay reactions favors an upper bound on the reheating temperature of @xmath0 gev , then superheavy dark matter scenario can be ruled out .",
    "note also that because of the presence of tensor to scalar power limit @xmath378 , improved experimental bounds on this quantity can also squeeze this dark matter scenario .",
    "there is also a corresponding @xmath379 bound on the mass @xmath11 of the superheavy dark matter .",
    "this implies that the gravitational particle production is in the exponentially suppressed regime since the exponent of the suppression is of order @xmath380 : i.e. noninfrared modes make up most of the dark matter .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in eq.([eq : helowerbound ] ) , one can not lower @xmath12 to less than @xmath381gev while keeping @xmath14 fixed and @xmath382gev to obtain sufficient abundance of dark matter because the overall dark matter density scales as @xmath383 .",
