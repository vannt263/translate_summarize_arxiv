    "one of the main goals of the particle physics is to unravel the quark and gluon structure of hadrons , which are fundamentally described by the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the framework of the yang - mills gauge theory . due to the nonperturbative nature of the qcd at the hadron scale , it is almost impossible to calculate all the properties of hadrons directly from the qcd at present .",
    "though the euclidean lattice method provides a first - principle numerical simulation  @xcite , it is challenged by the enormous computational complexity and the unavoidable multi - hadron thresholds  @xcite . the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation method also leads to important insights on the nonperturbative properties of qcd  @xcite . besides , the remarkable connection between the quantum gauge field theory in four dimensions and the classical gravity theory in five dimensions , developed in last fifteen years and known as the holographic dual , sheds light on the confinement dynamics in qcd  @xcite .    the parton model formulated by feynman and formalized by bjorken and paschos  @xcite",
    "is proved successful in explaining the high energy hadronic scattering experiments .",
    "based on the partonic picture and factorization theorem  @xcite , a general process independent function , referred to as the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , is defined to describe the light - cone longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the partons in a nucleon , and it is a powerful tool on data analyses of high energy hadronic scattering experiments . with the development of the polarization techniques , one is able to obtain spin - related partonic information in the nucleon from the helicity and transversity . to describe the three - dimensional structure of the nucleon , the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds )  @xcite and the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite",
    "are introduced and proven to be useful tools .",
    "the tmd contains three - dimensional momentum distributions of the partons , while the gpd contains longitudinal momentum and two - dimensional transverse coordinates of the partons through the impact parameter dependent densities ( ipds ) .    as a further generalization ,",
    "the wigner distributions are defined as a position - momentum joint distributions to understand the partonic structure of the nucleon .",
    "the wigner distribution is a kind of phase - space distribution which contains the most general one - parton information in a nucleon .",
    "in fact , it is not a new concept and has been widely applied in many physical areas , such as the quantum information , quantum molecular dynamics , optics , nonlinear dynamics and so on  @xcite , and is even directly measurable in some experiments  @xcite .",
    "the wigner distribution was first explored in qcd as a six - dimensional ( three positions and three momentums ) function  @xcite , where the relativistic effects were neglected .",
    "then a five - dimensional ( two transverse positions and three momentums ) wigner distribution  @xcite was proposed in the light - cone formalism or in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , where the parton language is well - defined .",
    "the simple qcd vacuum structure in the light - cone form allows an unambiguous definition of the constituents of a hadron  @xcite .",
    "the five - dimensional wigner distributions will reduce to the tmds and ipds , when the transverse coordinates or the transverse momentums are integrated . thus possible relations between the tmds and gpds may be established via the wigner distributions . unlike the tmds and the ipds , the wigner distributions do not have probability interpretations because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum theories  @xcite , but at twist - two they can be expressed in terms of light - cone wave functions and the semiclassical interpretations are still possible  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on quark wigner distributions in the proton . with the combination of the polarization configurations ( unpolarized or polarized along three spatial directions ) of the quark and the proton ,",
    "16 wigner distributions are defined at the leading twist .",
    "we investigate all these wigner distributions in a light - cone spectator model .",
    "both the scalar and the axial - vector spectators are included , and the axial - vector one is necessary for flavor separation .",
    "this model is proven successful in calculating the structure functions  @xcite . with the melosh - wigner rotation effect  @xcite taking into account ,",
    "this kind of models has been applied to investigate many physical quantities , such as quark unpolarized , helicity and transversity distributions  @xcite , form factors  @xcite , tmds  @xcite and gpds  @xcite , and the results are comparable with experiments",
    ". therefore , the investigation of the wigner distributions in such a simple model may still provide us some valuable information to help us understand the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the light - cone spectator model in sect .",
    "ii , and then calculate the wigner distributions in sect .",
    "the numerical results are shown in sect .",
    "iv including discussions . a summary is drawn in the last section .",
    "the proton is an eigenstate of the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath2 and the eigenvalue is the invariant mass square . in the light - cone ( or front ) form relativistic dynamics  @xcite , the fields are quantized at fixed light - cone time @xmath3 instead of the ordinary time @xmath4 in the instant form .",
    "the light - cone longitudinal momentum @xmath5 of any massive particle is restricted to be positive definite , and thus the fock space vacuum state @xmath6 , _ i.e. _ the free vacuum , is exactly the qcd vacuum , if the possibility of the color - singlet states built on massless gluon quanta with zero momentum is ignored  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may have unambiguous definition of the constituents of the hadron .",
    "then the proton state can be expanded on the complete basis of free multiparticle fock states as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of the components in the fock state @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the light - cone longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the @xmath11-th component , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are its intrinsic transverse momentum and light - cone helicity .",
    "the projection of the proton state on the fock state @xmath9 is the so - called light - cone wave function @xmath14 , which is frame independent .",
    "the proton state is normalized as @xmath15 and the light - cone wave functions are correspondingly normalized as @xmath16 the one - particle fock state is defined as @xmath17 with the commutation or anticommutation relations : @xmath18=\\{b(p),b^\\dagger(p')\\}=(2\\pi)^3\\delta(p^+-p'^+)\\delta^{(2)}(\\bm{p}_\\perp-\\bm{p}'_\\perp),\\ ] ] where the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are annihilation and creation operators for bosons and fermions respectively .    in the spectator model , the proton is viewed as a struck quark and a spectator that contains the remaining part of the proton .",
    "considering the fact that the leading term in the fock states expansion for the proton is the valence three quark state @xmath23 , we approximately regard the proton state as a valence quark and a spectator that carries the diquark quantum numbers , and some nonperturbative effects between the quarks and gluons in the spectator part from higher fock states are effectively absorbed into the mass of the spectator . this kind of picture has been applied to study many physical observables , and is supported by some light - front holographic model  @xcite .",
    "however this picture is actually simplistic , and some effects can not be realistically absorbed into the spectator mass  @xcite .",
    "more realistic analyses will provide better descriptions of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "here we only adopt this crude model to have some qualitative results .",
    "constained by the quantum numbers of the proton and the quark , the spectator can only be either a scalar or an axial - vector , and the latter one is necessary for flavor separation .",
    "therefore , we express the proton state as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for the scalar and the axial - vector spectators respectively , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momentum space light - cone wave functions and @xmath29 is an angle to describe the @xmath30 spin - flavor symmetry breaking . in this paper , we choose the isospin symmetric case @xmath31 in our calculations .",
    "this choice is also adopted in the calculations of helicity and transversity distributions  @xcite , form factors  @xcite and single spin asymmetries  @xcite , and the results therein are comparable with the data .",
    "one might alternatively regard it as a parameter to fit data .",

    "<S> , we can define 16 independent wigner distributions at leading twist . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate all these wigner distributions for the @xmath0 quark and the @xmath1 quark respectively . in our calculation , both the scalar and the axial - vector spectators are included , and the melosh - wigner rotation effects for both the quark and the axial - vector spectator are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide us a very rich picture of the quark structure in the proton . </S>"
