    "supersymmetry ( susy ) represents an appealing possibility for beyond the standard model physics ; its discovery would help provide answers to many of the preeminent questions in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology .",
    "however , as no sparticles have been observed , it is clear that if susy exists , it must be broken .",
    "the mechanism which could break susy is a question of great importance , and there is an ever growing list of possible scenarios , including msugra@xcite , gmsb@xcite , amsb@xcite , and gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking@xcite . in each of these scenarios ,",
    "the susy spectrum is described by a handful of parameters , generally defined at the susy breaking scale ; straightforward rge running of sparticle masses and coupling constants yields predictions for the mass spectra and decay patterns of the various sparticles at energy scales relevant for colliders or cosmology .",
    "however , these susy breaking scenarios are restrictive and predict specific phenomenologies for colliders and cosmology that do not represent the full range of possible susy signatures .    it is clearly desirable to study the mssm more broadly without making simplifying assumptions at the high scale that may turn out to be unwarranted .",
    "however , the mssm requires 105 parameters to describe susy breaking , in addition to the parameters of the sm@xcite .",
    "obviously this is far too many parameters to study directly , so some simplifying assumptions must be made . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the cp - conserving mssm ( , no new phases ) with minimal flavor violation ( mfv)@xcite . additionally , we require that the first two generations of sfermions be degenerate as motivated by constraints from flavor physics .",
    "we are then left with 19 independent , real , weak - scale , susy lagrangian parameters , namely the gaugino masses @xmath0 , the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath1 , the ratio of the higgs vevs @xmath2 , the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath3 , and the 10 squared masses of the sfermions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7,and @xmath8 ) .",
    "we include independent @xmath9-terms only for the third generation ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) due to the small yukawa couplings for the first two generations .",
    "this set of 19 parameters has been called the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm)@xcite .",
    "to study the pmssm , we performed a scan over this 19-dimensional parameter space assuming flat priors for the specified ranges@xcite : @xmath13    the value of 43.5 gev in the last constraint was chosen to avoid the possible on - shell decay @xmath14 .",
    "we randomly generated @xmath15 points in this parameter space and subjected them to a number of existing theoretical and experimental constraints .",
    "we also performed a scan with log priors and slightly different mass ranges ( that we will not employ here ) in order to gauge the influence of priors on our results ; we found that these results are substantially similar to those obtained in our flat prior scan@xcite . using these parameters we generate a susy spectrum utilizing suspect2.34@xcite .",
    "by convention , the parameters are specified at the scale given by the geometric mean of the two stop masses .",
    "the input values for the sm parameters used in our analysis are given in  @xcite .",
    "we then apply a series of constraints obtaining a set of models that satisfy all existing theoretical and experimental data .",
    "( this is the so - called `` flat prior '' set obtained in ref.@xcite . ) in the analysis below we will discuss the applied constraints then will examine the properties of the lsp at the parameter points which remain viable . in particular , we will examine the gaugino and higgsino content of the lsp ( which is always the lightest neutralino ) .",
    "we will also discuss the nature of the nlsp and the difference between its mass and the lsp mass ; this is important , for example , in coannihilation processes .",
    "we will then examine the signatures in direct and indirect wimp detection experiments obtained for these points in parameter space .",
    "we now discuss the theoretical and experimental constraints which we applied to the generated parameter space points ( which we shall hereafter refer to as `` models '' for convenience ) .",
    "we will present each of these briefly in turn ; for more details , one should consult  @xcite .",
    "we demand that the sparticle spectrum not have tachyons or color or charge breaking ( ccb ) minima in the scalar potential .",
    "we also require that the higgs potential be bounded from below and that electroweak symmetry breaking be consistent .",
    "we assume that the lsp , which will be absolutely stable , be a conventional thermal relic so that the lsp can be identified as the lightest neutralino .",
    "if it is a significant component of the dark matter , the lsp must be uncolored and uncharged , thus the lsp can only be a sneutrino or a neutralino .",
    "the possibility that the lsp is a sneutrino can be easily eliminated in the pmssm by combining several of the experimental constraints , particularly those involving direct detection of sneutrino wimps and the invisible width of the @xmath16 , as discussed below .      the code micromegas2.20@xcite was used to evaluate the following observables for each point in the parameter space : @xmath17 , the decay rates for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the @xmath20 of the muon .",
    "in addition , we evaluate the branching fraction for @xmath21 following@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ranges that we allow for these observables are listed in table  [ low energy table ] .",
    "the large range for the susy contribution to @xmath20 ( @xmath22 ) is due to the evolving discrepancy between theory and experiment@xcite .",
    ".ranges allowed for various low energy observables in our analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find that the range of values obtained for these cross sections covers the entire region in cross section/ lsp space that is anticipated from different types of beyond the standard model theories in the above reference .",
    "this possibly suggests that we can not use direct detection experiments to distinguish between  susy versus little higgs versus universal extra dimensions dark matter candidates in the absence of other data .    in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    ", we compare the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron cross sections in the spin - dependent and spin - independent cases .",
    "the spin - independent cross sections are seen to be fairly isospin independent ; this is not the case , however , for the spin - dependent cross sections .",
    "the pamela collaboration has recently claimed an excess in the ratio of cosmic ray positrons to electrons observed at energies @xmath23 gev@xcite .",
    "here we employ darksusy 5.0.4@xcite to calculate this ratio for our model sample and compare these results with the pamela data .    in general , for a thermal relic",
    "dark matter candidate to reproduce the pamela data , its signal rate must be multiplied by a boost factor@xcite . in nature , such a boost factor could result from , , a local overdensity .",
    "the boost factor in that case would be the square of the ratio between the density of dark matter in the region from which one is sensitive to cosmic ray positrons and electrons to the universe as a whole .",
    "we have investigated four of the propagation models available as default choices in darksusy : the model of baltz and edsj(be)@xcite , that of kamionkowski and turner(kt)@xcite , that of moskalenko and strong(ms)@xcite , as well as galprop@xcite . in the figures that follow",
    "we show the results of calculations using the ms propagation model , which is based on early galprop green s functions and whose results typically lie between those computed otherwise",
    ". however , we note that the extent to which the positron / electron flux ratio predicted by our models matches the pamela data can be highly sensitive to the choice of propagation model parameters and assumed astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "we will explore this further in future work@xcite .",
    "the halo model employed here is the navarro - frenck - white profile@xcite .",
    "the differential positron flux as a function of energy for a random sample of 500 models from our set are shown in figure  [ fig14 ] . here",
    "we assume a boost factor of @xmath24 ; the normalization of the curves takes into account the fact that for many of these models @xmath25 .",
    "we next determine how well the predicted positron fluxes for these models agree with the pamela data , allowing for the possibility of a boost factor . to do this",
    ", we find the value for the boost factor ( with the restriction that it be @xmath26 ) which minimizes the @xmath27 for the fit of each model s prediction to the pamela data .",
    "( note that many of the models require an even larger boost to obtain a good fit and are thus not shown in figure  [ fig15 ] ) . in calculating the @xmath27",
    ", we consider only the seven highest energy bins , as at lower energies solar modulation is expected to play a major role@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig15 ] shows the @xmath27 and corresponding boost factor for these 500 random models .",
    "note that there are four data points for each model in this figure .",
    "we then display the positron to electron flux ratio , for the models with a low value of @xmath27 employing ms propagation , as a function of energy in figure  [ fig16 ] , and note the reasonable agreement with the data for some models .",
    "since the flux from wimp annihilation scales as @xmath28 , we might expect to improve the match to the pamela data using models from our sample for which @xmath29 . to test this ,",
    "we examine the predicted positron flux for 500 random models with @xmath30 employing ms propagation ; these fluxes are shown in figure  [ fig17 ] with no boost factor .",
    "we then again find the boost factor that minimizes the @xmath27 of the positron to electron flux ratios with respect to the seven highest energy pamela bins ; these are shown in figure  [ fig18 ] . here",
    ", we note that there are many more models for which the @xmath27-minimizing value for the boost factor is @xmath31 and there are many more points for which the @xmath27 value is low .",
    "the positron to electron flux ratios for these models , including the boost factor , are shown in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "it appears that some of our models do a reasonably good job of fitting the pamela positron data , especially in the case where @xmath32 lies fairly close to the wmap value . for most models , describing the pamela data requires large boost factors , however this is also a fairly generic feature of attempts to explain pamela and atic data in terms of wimp annihilation@xcite .",
    "there are however , many models which give relatively low @xmath27 per degree of freedom in the fit to the data with relatively small boost factors .",
    "we will study this further in future work @xcite .",
    "a study of the corresponding predictions for the the cosmic ray anti - proton flux is also underway .",
    "we have generated a large set of points in parameter space ( which we call `` models '' ) for the 19-parameter cp - conserving pmssm , where mfv has been assumed .",
    "we subjected these models to numerous experimental and theoretical constraints to obtain a set of @xmath33  k models which are consistent with existing data .",
    "we attempted to be somewhat conservative in our implementation of these constraints ; in particular we only demanded that the relic density of the lsp not be greater than the measured value of @xmath34 for non - baryonic dark matter , rather than assuming that the lsp must account for the _ entire _ observed relic density .",
    "examining the properties of the neutralinos in these models , we find that many are relatively pure gauge eigenstates with higgsinos being the most common , followed by winos .",
    "the relative prevalence of higgsino and wino lsps leads many of our models to have a chargino as nlsp , often with a relatively small mass splitting between this nlsp and the lsp ; this has important consequences in both collider and astroparticle phenomenology .",
    "we find that , in general , the lsp in our models provides a relatively small ( @xmath35 ) contribution to the dark matter , however there is a long tail to this distribution and a substantial number of models for which the lsp makes up all or most of the dark matter",
    ". typically these neutralinos are mostly binos .    examining the signatures of our models in direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments , we find a wide range of signatures for both cases .",
    "in particular , we find , not unexpectedly a much larger range of wimp - nucleon cross sections than is found in any particular model of susy - breaking as can be seen by comparing directly with the work in ref.@xcite . in fact , as these cross sections also enter the regions of parameter space suggested by non - susy models , it appears that the discovery of wimps in direct detection experiments might not be sufficient to determine the correct model of the underlying physics . as a first look at the signatures of these models in indirect detection experiments",
    ", we examined whether our models could explain the pamela excess in the positron to electron ratio at high energies .",
    "we find that there are models which fit the pamela data rather well where the lsp is mostly bino , and some of these have significantly smaller boost factors than generally assumed for a thermal relic .",
    "the study of the pmssm presents exciting new possibilities for susy phenomenology .",
    "the next few years will hopefully see important discoveries both in colliders and in satellite or ground - based astrophysical experiments .",
    "it is important that we follow the data and not our existing prejudices ; hopefully this sort of relatively model - independent approach to collider and astrophysical phenomenology can be useful in this regard .",
