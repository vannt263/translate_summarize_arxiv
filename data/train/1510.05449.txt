    "the heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic and lhc give us the opportunity to study the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the collective motion , the nuclear medium effects and so on .",
    "the particle spectrum is one of the basic quantities measured in experiments to address the questions raised in such studies .",
    "recently , the tsallis distribution has attracted the attention of many theorists and experimentalists in high energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to particle spectra produced in different reaction systems , from pp , pa to aa , to understand the particle production mechanism and extract physical quantities , e.g. temperature @xcite , chemical potential @xcite . in pp collisions ,",
    "the excellent ability to fit the spectra of identified hadrons and charged particles in a large range of @xmath1 up to 200 gev / c is quite impressive @xcite . a systematic investigation of particle spectra in p+p collisions at rhic and lhc has been conducted in ref .",
    "the results show that the tsallis distribution can fit all the particle spectra at different energies in p+p collisions .",
    "a possible cascade particle production mechanism is proposed .",
    "recently , a tsallis distribution scaling function was found for charged hadron spectra in p+p and p+@xmath2 collisions @xcite .",
    "comparing to nucleus - nucleus collisions , the pp collision is very simple .",
    "it has been used as a baseline for nucleus - nucleus collisions . a nuclear modification factor @xmath3 or @xmath4",
    "was proposed to show the nuclear medium effects in pa or aa collisions referring to pp collisions @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor different from unity is a manifestation of medium effects .",
    "many authors have successfully applied tsallis distribution to fit particle spectra in pa and aa collisions even though the spectra were affected by nuclear medium modification @xcite .",
    "we also notice that many works only show the small @xmath1 part of the particle spectra , while the exponential distribution also can fit the low @xmath1 region @xcite",
    ". it should cover all the @xmath1 regions of particle spectra , available in experiment , in order to show the advantage and/or the fitting power of the tsallis distribution . in recent years",
    ", the experimental groups at rhic and lhc have published the wide @xmath1 range of particle spectra for different particles in different reaction systems .",
    "such data allow us to conduct the systematic study of particle spectra in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc using the tsallis distribution , as we have done for p+p collisions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we would like to test whether the tsallis distribution can fit all the particle spectra produced at rhic and lhc , which can help us to understand the particle production mechanism .",
    "before we start to conduct our investigation , we can get some clues to estimate whether it can fit the particle spectrum or not from the nuclear modification factor .",
    "if the @xmath3 or @xmath4 is flat for the whole @xmath1 region , according to its definition , this means that the particle spectrum is similar in shape and only differs in magnitude to the one in p+p collisions . based on the previous studies @xcite",
    ", we are sure that the tsallis distribution can fit the particle spectrum since it can fit all the particle spectra produced in p+p collisions , especially up to extremely high @xmath1 @xcite . in the pa reactions , @xmath3 are flat and very close to 1 for most of the produced particles at different centralities @xcite . while in the aa collisions , the nuclear medium effects play an important role .",
    "@xmath4 increases from the most central collisions to peripheral collisions @xcite .",
    "since the nuclear modification factors of different particles are almost 1 in peripheral heavy - ion collisions @xcite , as we discussed , tsallis distribution should be able to fit the particle spectra .",
    "therefore we will only focus on the particle spectra at the most central collisions where the tsallis distribution may not fit all of them .",
    "we have collected data of particle spectra from d+au , cu+cu , au+au collisions at rhic and p+pb , pb+pb collisions at lhc and select the data for most of the particles with the highest @xmath5 gev to conduct this study .",
