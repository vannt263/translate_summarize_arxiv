    "a significant number of top quark candidate events reported by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations at the tevatron @xmath6 collider contain an extra hadronic jet , in addition to those expected from the leading - order processes @xmath7 .",
    "such jets can be produced , for example , by gluons emitted from the incoming partons , from the top quarks before or after they decay , or from the @xmath8 quarks in the final state .",
    "events with such ` extra ' jets are important from both the experimental and theoretical viewpoints .",
    "experimentally , they can complicate the identification and measurement of the top quark , for example when a gluon jet is wrongly identified as a @xmath8 jet .",
    "they can also , at least in principle , distort the measurement of the top mass when some of the top quark four - momentum is carried by a jet which is not identified as one of the decay products .",
    "there have been several recent studies of extra jets in top production . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a complete treatment of all the various contributions was presented in the ` soft - gluon ' approximation .",
    "this work built on previous studies @xcite of radiation off heavy unstable objects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the impact of hard - gluon radiation on top mass reconstruction was investigated , using a stable , on - shell top quark approximation which factorizes the gluon emission into @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) contributions . and",
    "of course the parton - shower monte carlo programs used in the experimental analyses naturally give rise to events with extra jets .",
    "however these are based on collinear approximations to matrix elements and , in some cases , may have certain types of gluon emission missing .",
    "in this paper we present the first complete calculation of the exact matrix elements for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , including ( i ) the contributions from gluons emitted during the top production and decay stages and the interference between these , and ( ii ) the complete set of feynman diagrams corresponding to both resonant and non - resonant top production . in the same way that the vecbos @xcite matrix - element - based program is successfully used to analyze @xmath12 jets events",
    ", we would expect our calculation to provide the most accurate predictions for those events in which an additional energetic jet in association with the usual @xmath2 decay products is observed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe how the matrix elements are calculated using the madgraph program @xcite .",
    "we discuss how these matrix elements are interfaced with the phase space generator to produce cross sections , and how it is possible to classify the emitted gluons as originating at either the top production or decay stages . in section  3",
    "we describe the set of kinematical cuts which enables us to define and calculate a @xmath13 jet cross section that is relevant to the experimental measurements .",
    "we present distributions of the jet @xmath14 and pseudorapidity , and also of the separation between the jet and the @xmath8 quarks , an important quantity when attempting to reconstruct the top momentum .",
    "some illustrative invariant mass distributions are also presented . in section  4",
    "we compare our distributions with those from the herwig @xcite parton - shower monte carlo program , one of the main analysis tools used in the experimental analyses .",
    "we make a careful comparison of the jet distributions obtained in our matrix - element ( me ) approach with those generated by the parton - shower ( ps ) approach , since any differences _",
    "could _ have important implications for the measurement of the top mass .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  5 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , previous works have investigated the effects of gluon radiation beyond leading order in either the ` stable top ' @xcite or ` soft - gluon ' approximations @xcite . in this study",
    "we focus on @xmath2 production in association with an extra jet which is identified as such in the experiment .",
    "we perform the complete @xmath15 tree - level matrix element calculation , including top width effects , radiation off the top decay products , and all interferences .",
    "in @xmath16 collisions there are three relevant parton - level processes which may contribute to @xmath17 production with an additional jet : @xmath18 subprocesses one and three are related by crossing and consist of 90 feynman diagrams , while subprocess two consists of 222 feynman diagrams .",
    "the complete set of diagrams and the corresponding helicity - amplitude code were generated automatically using the madgraph @xcite package . in practice",
    ", the contribution from subprocess three is very small , the extra jet is almost always a gluon jet ( and for simplicity will be referred to as such in what follows ) .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from subprocess two ( @xmath19 fusion ) is suppressed by the gluon density in the proton . therefore , although the full set of diagrams was used to generate the figures presented in this paper , a reasonable approximation can be obtained by using the 7 @xmath20 production diagrams shown in fig .  1 .",
    "annihilation cross section is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath19 fusion cross section for @xmath2 production with @xmath21  gev at the tevatron collider . ]",
    "we neglect radiation off the decay products of the @xmath22 s ; this is equivalent to assuming either that ( i ) the @xmath22 s decay leptonically , or ( ii ) strict cuts on the mass reconstruction of the @xmath22 will largely eliminate events where the @xmath22 decays into three well - separated jets . in practice",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation , but in principle the analysis could be extended to include the hadronic decay of one of the @xmath22 bosons , and the corresponding radiation off the @xmath23 decay products .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the production of an extra jet was analyzed in the soft approximation , it was shown that the gluon emission could be separated unambiguously into ` production ' and ` decay ' contributions , together with interferences between them .",
    "the former includes emission off the incoming partons and off the top quark _ before _",
    "it weak decays .",
    "the latter includes emission off the top quark _ during _ its decay , and off the daughter @xmath8 quarks .",
    "the interference between these types of emissions is only important for soft gluons whose energy is comparable to the top width , @xmath24 @xcite .    in the context of our exact calculation ,",
    "the separation into production and decay contributions is not completely unambiguous ( nor gauge invariant in general ) , but a consistent operational definition based on partitioning the phase space can be formulated as follows . production emission is defined as those regions of phase space for which the masses of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 systems reconstruct to the top mass . decay emission is defined as those regions of phase space for which either the @xmath25 or @xmath26 system requires the inclusion of the extra jet to give the top mass .",
    "this is implemented by comparing the relative sizes of the breit - wigner resonances which appear in the matrix element .",
    "explicitly , we define @xmath27 an event is then labeled as production emission if @xmath28 , and as decay emission if @xmath29 .",
    "this definition is gauge invariant and can be used in any region of phase space for any set of cuts .",
    "since the jet @xmath30 cut will remove the contribution from very soft gluon emission , one finds that for most events which pass the cuts either @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "for such events production emission is well described by diagrams 15 in fig .  1 , and decay emission",
    "is well described by diagrams 47 . ) is closer to being on shell before or after it radiates the gluon . ]",
    "this decomposition of the radiation is the natural generalization of the definition used in refs .",
    "@xcite and proves useful in understanding the distribution of the radiation .",
    "our aim is to calculate the cross section for the production of an extra , identifiable jet in @xmath2 production and decay .",
    "we therefore impose the following cuts on the final state partons ( the subscript @xmath34 refers to the extra jet only ) : and @xmath35 quarks . ] @xmath36 in addition , since the extra gluon jet must be distinguishable from the @xmath8 jets , we require the gluon to be separated ( in ( @xmath37 ) space ) from the @xmath8 and @xmath35 : @xmath38 the values of the cut parameters are deliberately chosen to mimic those in the actual experiments . they also serve to protect the theoretical cross section from the soft and collinear singularities of the matrix element .",
    "other parameters are : @xmath39  tev , @xmath40  gev , @xmath41  gev , @xmath42  gev , and @xmath43  gev .",
    "we use mrs(a ) parton distributions @xcite with @xmath44  mev , @xmath45 so that @xmath46 .    with the above cuts , we obtain the total jet cross section @xmath47 with 51% and 49% coming from the production and decay contributions respectively .",
    "this is to be compared to the leading - order cross section @xmath48 we note that the sum of these is not too far from the exact next - to - leading order total cross section of @xmath49  pb calculated in ref .",
    "although it gives an indication of consistency in the calculations , this equivalence should not be taken too seriously .",
    "the cross sections in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jet ] ) and ( [ eq : nojet ] ) depend on the cuts applied to the final - state particles , and we have not included virtual gluon corrections to the lowest - order cross section .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 cross section we calculate here contains what we might otherwise think of as corrections to two separate processes . roughly speaking , part of the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jet ] ) is part of the @xmath50 correction to the @xmath51 decay width , while the remainder is part of the @xmath50 ` k - factor ' correction to the production cross section . in the limit",
    "@xmath52 this correspondence can be made exact  a full discussion can be found in sec .",
    "2.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this section",
    "we study the distribution in phase space of the extra gluon jet , for the production , decay and total emission contributions , as was done in the soft - gluon analysis of ref .",
    "we note that the cuts we use are slightly different from those used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this largely accounts for the differences in shapes of some of the distributions .",
    "2 shows the jet @xmath53 distribution .",
    "the production ( dot - dashed histogram ) and decay ( dotted histogram ) contributions are broadly similar in shape , with a slight tendency for decay gluons to have higher @xmath14 . also shown , for comparison , is the @xmath14 distribution of the @xmath8 and @xmath35 quarks . as one would expect , the latter is significantly harder .",
    "more interesting is the jet pseudorapidity distribution shown in fig .",
    "we see a clear difference between the production and decay distributions .",
    "the former is broad , reflecting the importance of initial state radiation , while the latter is peaked in the central region , reflecting the tendency of the decay gluons to follow the directions of the @xmath8 and @xmath35 quarks .",
    "the distribution is quite sensitive to the @xmath54 separation cut .",
    "decreasing this from its nominal value of 0.4 has little effect on the production part , but increases the decay part .",
    "this can be inferred from fig .  4 , where the distribution in the jet@xmath8 separation itself is shown .",
    "for production gluons , the dominance of initial - state radiation gives a broad distribution peaked at @xmath55 .",
    "for decay gluons , the collinear quasi - singularity when the gluons are emitted close to the @xmath8 quarks ( it is not a true singularity because the @xmath8 s are massive ) gives rise to a sharp peak at small @xmath54 .",
    "this figure illustrates the strong dependence of the relative proportions of production and decay contributions on the separation cut .",
    "there are obvious problems in constructing the top mass from its decay products when there are additional jets in the final state .",
    "for example , the definition @xmath56 will give the correct mass when the extra jet is a production gluon , but will _ underestimate _ the mass when it is a decay gluon .",
    "conversely , the definition @xmath57 will be correct for decay gluons , but will _ overestimate _ the mass for production gluons .",
    "of course , this takes no account of the fact that any gross mismeasurement will be apparent when one compares the reconstructed masses of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in principle",
    ", one can simply ignore permutations of the decay products which lead to @xmath60 .    in practice ,",
    "however , given the experimental uncertainties in measuring the jet energies and in reconstructing one of the @xmath22 bosons from its leptonic decay products , there is a danger of biasing the @xmath61 measurement in events with extra jets , for example by adopting a strategy of not including such jets in the top quark four - momentum .",
    "for this reason , it is interesting to study the distortion of the top resonance in the presence of extra jets .",
    "figure  5 shows the distribution in @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "there are two entries for each event , corresponding to combining ( say ) the @xmath64 with both the @xmath8 and the @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed histogram ( production emission contribution ) simply illustrates the smearing of the resonance peak from choosing the ` wrong ' @xmath65 combination .",
    "the dotted histogram ( decay emission contribution ) has a significant shoulder on the lower side of the peak , showing the effect of omitting a gluon which was part of the top decay .",
    "the slight dip in the distribution below the peak reflects the @xmath14 cut on the gluon jet .",
    "the net effect ( solid histogram ) is a distribution with a strong peak at @xmath61 which is sitting on an asymmetric background , with a preference for lower mass values as expected . for purposes of comparison ,",
    "the insert in fig .",
    "5 shows the leading order ` correct combination ' @xmath66 breit - wigner distribution with width @xmath67 .",
    "when the extra jet is included in the mass reconstruction , the tendency is to overestimate the true mass .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , which shows the distribution in @xmath68 , where now @xmath69 . in this case",
    "it is the production gluon emissions which generate a shoulder above the peak .",
    "there is also a similar effect from decay gluons which are emitted off the ` wrong ' top quark",
    ".    an interesting feature of figs .",
    "5 and 6 is the much stronger broadening effect in the latter , in which there is a much larger contribution to the cross section _ outside _ the main peak .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that there is a single extra jet in each event and can be understood as follows .",
    "let us ignore wrong @xmath70 pairings and consider only correct ones ; the wrong pairings merely contribute smooth backgrounds to both figures . in each event",
    "at least one of the @xmath70 pairs will reconstruct to @xmath61 ( up to finite - width and interference effects which we can ignore ) .",
    "roughly half of these events will correspond to production emission , in which case the other @xmath70 pair will also reconstruct to @xmath61 .",
    "hence @xmath71 of correct @xmath70 pairs contribute to the @xmath61 peak in fig .",
    "those same three - quarters of @xmath70 pairs , when combined with the extra gluon jet , will then typically fall above the @xmath61 peak in fig .",
    "the remaining one quarter , which fell below the peak in fig .  5 ,",
    "_ do _ contribute to the @xmath61 peak when combined with the extra jet , as in fig .",
    "6 .    figs .  5 and 6",
    "show , then , that in events with extra jets , one can not unambiguously reconstruct the top mass either by systematically excluding or including the jet momentum in the reconstruction . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , one might hope to utilize the different characteristics of production and decay emissions ( as illustrated in figs .",
    "24 ) to devise a strategy for deciding whether to include the extra jets in the reconstruction .",
    "for example , since forward jets tend to be mostly from production ( fig .",
    "3 ) , one could decide to omit forward jets from mass reconstructions . in the central region , where both production and decay jets contribute significantly",
    ", one might gain by making assignments using weighting criteria according to , for example , proximity to the @xmath8 quarks . in any such procedure , of course",
    ", proper account must be taken of hadronization and detector resolution effects , which are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "soft gluons are able to probe the color structure of a hard scattering process @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the distribution of the soft gluon jet was shown to be sensitive to the color structure of the process @xmath72 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath73 antenna ( or ` string ' ) produces more radiation in the region between the @xmath58 and @xmath74 than , say , between the @xmath58 and @xmath75 . in practice ,",
    "the effect can be observed by comparing the probability of gluon radiation between the proton and the @xmath8 quark with that between the proton and @xmath35 quark @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in whether the asymmetry observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the soft gluon approximation survives the more exact calculation of the present study . and",
    "@xmath76 processes included here but omitted in ref .",
    "@xcite tend to dilute the asymmetry . ]    following the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( but with the basic cuts given in eqs .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) and ( [ cutsbis ] ) ) , we define a subsample of @xmath77 jet events in which the @xmath8 and @xmath35 are separated by at least @xmath78 in azimuth .",
    "this tends to select events in which the parent @xmath58 and @xmath59 have similar separation .",
    "we then preferentially select gluon jets associated with the @xmath58 ( as opposed to the @xmath59 ) by requiring that they lie within @xmath79 in azimuth from the @xmath8 quark .",
    "the @xmath80 distribution of such jets should then be asymmetric , with more jets produced at forward rapidities , _",
    "i.e. _ , between the directions of the @xmath8 and the incoming @xmath81 . figure  7(a ) shows that there is indeed a small forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "but note that this asymmetry is a feature of ` production ' emission only  the ` decay ' emission gives a symmetric pseudorapidity distribution ( at least in the limit when @xmath82 so that interference contributions can be neglected ) .",
    "one can therefore enhance the asymmetry by increasing the separation cut @xmath54 , thereby reducing the decay emission contribution .",
    "figure  7(b ) shows the corresponding @xmath80 distribution when the cut is increased to @xmath83 .",
    "it should also be possible to optimize the azimuthal angle cuts to enhance the effect .",
    "we have already seen that the cross section for the emission of an extra jet in @xmath2 production has a very rich structure , with the two main contributions coming from production and decay emission .",
    "we have given examples of how this relates to simple top mass reconstruction scenarios .",
    "it is vitally important that the programs used in the actual experimental analyses , which must of course take hadronization and detector effects fully into account and are therefore much more sophisticated than our parton - level calculations , contain as much of this structure as possible .",
    "it is not our intention here to make an exhaustive comparison with all the available programs for simulating top production .",
    "instead , we compare our predictions for the jet distributions with those of the herwig monte carlo program ( v5.8 ) @xcite , which is widely used in collider physics . this comparison is not at all straightforward , even when hadronization is switched off , since the monte carlo program can generate @xmath84 events with many additional quarks and gluons in the final state .",
    "we must therefore introduce a simple jet algorithm for clustering these partons . specifically , we draw cones in @xmath85 space around the @xmath8 quarks and around any additional energetic partons in the final state , and assign all transverse energy within the cones to the jet . in this way we obtain a final state with @xmath8-jets ( which contain a @xmath8 quark and possibly other partons ) and additional jets originating in energetic , wide - angle quark and gluon bremsstrahlung . the default cone size for clustering",
    "is chosen to be @xmath86 .",
    "we then apply the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) and ( [ cutsbis ] ) and select those events with one and only one additional jet , and compare this @xmath77 jet sample ( labeled ps for parton shower in the figures below ) with that generated by our tree - level matrix element calculation ( labeled me ) .",
    "8 shows the normalized distributions in ( a ) the jet-@xmath8 separation @xmath54 , ( b ) the jet pseudorapidity @xmath87 , ( c ) the jet @xmath14 , and ( d ) the jet energy @xmath88 in the parton subprocess center - of - mass frame .",
    "the first two show significant differences in shape .",
    "it would appear that the ps calculation produces _ too few jets in the direction of the @xmath8 quarks_. in fact one can see in the ps distribution in fig .",
    "8(a ) a clear separation between the ` production ' jets , which are widely separated from the @xmath8 quarks in general , and the ` decay ' jets which prefer to be close to the @xmath8 quarks .",
    "the me calculation evidently produces more of the latter and the dip is filled in .",
    "the same effect is seen in the @xmath87 distribution , fig .",
    "8(b ) . the peaking at @xmath89 in our me calculation is caused by a sizeable contribution from ` decay ' gluons produced close to the centrally - produced @xmath8 quarks .",
    "interestingly , the energy distributions shown in fig .",
    "8(c ) are very similar .",
    "however , the preference for more centrally produced jets in the me calculation produces a harder jet @xmath14 spectrum , fig .",
    "9 shows the @xmath62 and @xmath68 distributions for the me and ps calculations .",
    "and @xmath90 combinations in fig .  9 . ]",
    "the differences simply reflect the different behaviours already seen in fig .",
    "there are more ps events in the peak at @xmath61 in the @xmath62 distribution , and consequently fewer peak events in the @xmath68 distribution , since the ps calculation has apparently fewer jets emitted in the decay process .",
    "as noted above , the ps calculation requires a jet algorithm to cluster partons into jets .",
    "we have tried varying the cone size away from its nominal value of @xmath91 to see if we can improve the agreement between the me and ps results .",
    "we find , however , that the changes that result are small in comparison with the discrepancy ( in particular for the @xmath54 distribution ) between the models .",
    "we have no simple explanation as to why the ps calculation appears to give qualitatively different distributions in jet variables than our exact calculation , except to note that the differences appear to originate in the relative number of jets produced in top production and decay .",
    "traditionally , me and ps calculations are expected to agree quite well , except when the final state contains very energetic , widely - spaced parton jets ; see for example the study in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath22 + jets production . for such configurations ,",
    "the leading - logarithm approximation inherent in the ps approach is expected to break down .",
    "however , we note that our cuts as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) and ( [ cutsbis ] ) are not very stringent , and therefore _ not _ particularly biased in favor of such events .",
    "in fact , we have checked that the @xmath54 calculated using the soft - gluon approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite is very similar to the result of the exact ( me ) calculation shown in fig .",
    "it is important that experimental data analyses are based on predictions that account for all relevant physical effects . in the case of the top quark ,",
    "one very relevant physical effect is the presence of extra jets in top events .",
    "we have presented the results of the first exact calculation of hadronic @xmath17 production and decay in association with an additional jet , taking into account all feynman diagrams that can contribute , including both resonant and non - resonant top production and all interferences .",
    "this extends the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to gluons of arbitrary energies , and allows for a more complete and exact analysis .",
    "we have studied the distribution of such extra jets , and showed that the cross section can be decomposed into emissions associated with top production and with top decay , according to a gauge - invariant operational definition .",
    "this decomposition is particularly relevant to top mass reconstruction , and our motivation was , in part , to consider the consequences for top mass measurement of the presence of such extra jets in top events .",
    "we have seen that extra jets can give rise to shoulders outside the breit - wigner peak in @xmath70 and @xmath92 invariant mass distributions , potentially degrading the resolution for top mass measurements .",
    "we have also considered distributions generated with the herwig parton - shower monte carlo program , which is a major analysis tool for the experiments and which uses a collinear approximation to simulate emission of gluons . after defining a jet clustering algorithm that allowed us to compare our matrix element results with those of herwig",
    ", we have found some discrepancies .",
    "these appear to indicate a relatively smaller contribution from decay gluons generated by herwig , but we are unable to explain the difference in detail .",
