    "the orion nebula ( m42 , ngc1976 ) , being the nearest ( @xmath3 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) massive star - forming region , is ideal for investigating the physics of young stellar objects ( ysos ) and their interactions with ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite first discovered several gaseous knots ( lv 16 ) adjacent to the trapezium cluster .",
    "these knots are bright in optical emission lines and believed to be protoplanetary disks embedded in primeval material . the uv radiation from the primary trapezium ionizing star , @xmath4 ori c ( @xmath5 mag ) , constantly illuminates and photoevaporates these circumstellar disks , driving @xmath13photoevaporated flows @xcite .",
    "the flows accelerate to few tens of @xmath6 as they pass through the ionization fronts located at several disk radii .",
    "the interaction between the outflows and the stellar wind from @xmath4 ori c has created various features , including stationary bow shocks and cometary tails pointing away from the ionizing star . so far in the orion nebula more than 200 proplyds , either externally illuminated by ionizing photons from young massive stars or seen in silhouettes against the nebular background , have been discovered by various _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "surveys @xcite .    of these proplyds",
    "the lv 1 is unique as a tight binary system @xcite .",
    "two proplyds separated by 04 ( projected on the sky ) comprise this system , with the secondary ( 168326 nw ) being physically closer to @xmath4 ori c , and the primary ( 168326 se ) located at the southeast .",
    "lv 1 has the least massive proplyds in the submillimeter survey carried out by @xcite , with the total disk mass @xmath72 @xmath8 @xmath9 . both proplyds exhibit classic crescent ionization fronts and cometary tails ; however , there is also a surprisingly thin straight `` shell '' in - between the components .",
    "the shell is prominent in emission lines , e.g. , [ ] and h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it was also imaged in 5 ghz radio continuum by @xcite .",
    "simulations suggested that the collision of photoevaporated flows could form such a flat interproplyd shell @xcite , making lv 1 the first evidence of proplyd interaction in the orion nebula .",
    "this is an important example of a short - lived , but critical , phase of binary evolution in ob clusters .    in this paper , we present high spatial resolution h@xmath0 observations of lv 1 with the magellan adaptive optics system ( magao ) .",
    "magao is a new adaptive optics system used with the 6.5 m clay telescope . utilizing a 585-actuator adaptive secondary mirror to correct phase distortions , magao is the world s first ao system which demonstrates reasonable performance in visible wavelengths , with strehl ratio @xmath130% and resolution @xmath120 mas on bright stars @xmath10 mag .",
    "we also include published near - infrared ( near - ir ) [ ] and br@xmath11 ao observations with the 8.4 m large binocular telescope ( lbt ; * ? ? ?",
    "magao observations of lv 1 at 6563  h@xmath0 and 6730  [ ] were made on 2012 december 3 ( ut ) during the first magao commissioning run .",
    "we locked the ao system on @xmath4 ori c at 250 modes and 990 hz bandwidth .",
    "the guide star is @xmath163 from the proplyd ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , but we placed it outside of the @xmath12 field of view of the visao science camera @xcite to prevent saturation over the entire image . as a result of anisoplanatism , the data suffered a mild oval distortion toward @xmath4 ori c with fwhm ranging from 005 to 006 , comparable to _ hst _ performance .",
    "we employed the spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) mode of the visao camera to simultaneously observe the emission line and the continuum ( point - spread function , psf ) .",
    "the sdi mode works by separating the incoming light into two orthogonal linearly polarized beams with a wollaston prism .",
    "the beams then pass two narrowband filters ( very near the _",
    "f_/52 visao focus ) , one for the emission line and the other for the continuum , before arriving the camera ( for more on the sdi technique , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we obtained @xmath13 s h@xmath0 exposures and @xmath14 s at [ ] .",
    "we did not detect lv 1 in the h@xmath0 continuum nor in [ ] , so these images are not presented .",
    "data reduction is carried out using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the data were first dark - subtracted and cross - correlated , but not flat - field - corrected due to a lack of h@xmath0 flat frames . however , the visao science grade e2v ccd is quite flat to @xmath151% .",
    "then we rotated the images counterclockwise by rotoff+89.11 deg , where rotoff is the standard parallactic angle keyword in the visao header , so that north is up and east is left to @xmath16 .",
    "after median - combining the data , we selected @xmath4 ori f ( @xmath17 mag ; @xmath12@xmath18 from the proplyds ) as the psf .",
    "fortuitously , @xmath4 ori f is aligned almost exactly at the same position angle ( p.a . ) as lv 1 with respect to @xmath4 ori c , so the psf shows the same isoplanatic elongation and orientation ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "finally we deconvolved the reduced images using the iraf stsdas @xmath19 task .",
    "the lbt ao reduced images of [ ] ( 1.644 @xmath20 m ; fwhm = 0042 ) and br@xmath11 ( 2.16 @xmath20 m ; fwhm = 0055 ) from @xcite were also examined here .",
    "we also deconvolved these images with @xmath19 .",
    "lv 1 is unique in its various features sculptured by the powerful stellar wind of @xmath4 ori c and the mutual interactions between two proplyds .",
    "our deconvolved h@xmath0 image of lv 1 is presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "features like the bright ionization fronts , the interproplyd shell , and the cometary tails are clearly seen .",
    "it is remarkable that we can perform a 63 off - axis guiding at h@xmath0 from the ground and still have excellent images .",
    "this also demonstrates the power and potential of magao in the visible regime even for off - axis science .",
    "we examine the orbital motion of lv 1 by comparing the magao h@xmath0 ( @xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the _ hst _",
    "h@xmath0 observations of 1995 march 21 @xcite .",
    "the magao platescale was calibrated by comparing the positions of four trapezium stars from visao images with unsaturated _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys astrometry @xcite .",
    "since the photospheres are invisible in h@xmath0 , we look for any offset in the ionization fronts .",
    "the _ hst _ separation and p.a . were measured to @xmath22 mas and @xmath23 , while for magao we have @xmath24 mas and @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainties include difficulty in fitting the crescent shape , centroid error , platescale error , and geometric distortion .",
    "hence we see over @xmath118 yr a motion of just @xmath26 mas and @xmath27 .",
    "these low values are consistent with no significant motion and quite reasonable if these objects are of low mass since one would expect about 8 mas ( maximum velocity on sky with an edge - on circular orbit and masses @xmath28 ) or 12 ( face - on orbit ) relative motion . if , for example , they were each solar mass objects we would expect about 29 mas or 45 of motion that we would have detected .",
    "therefore , the lack of any significant offset observed is further evidence of the likely low mass of the system .",
    "lv 1 is almost absent in our optical continuum images , indicating that it is obscured by dust .",
    "recent sofia mid - ir observations found evidence that lv 1 shows a ne  sw elongation in accordance with the interproplyd shell @xcite .",
    "this implies that dust may be entrained by the photoevaporated flow such that the mid - ir is mainly from the superheated disk atmospheres and the interproplyd shell , not from photospheres of lv 1 itself .",
    "however , as the total disk mass is just @xmath7@xmath29 , the extinction may not be very large .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the deconvolved [ ] ( 1.644 @xmath20 m ) and br@xmath11 ( 2.16 @xmath20 m ) images .",
    "the ionization front of 168326 se and the interproplyd shell are prominent in br@xmath11 , but the shell is extremely faint in [ ] , as we expect since this should mainly trace continuum emission . on the other hand ,",
    "168326 se in [ ] looks more like a point source with an offset in position located behind the ionization front seen in br@xmath11 .",
    "compared with optical observations , [ ] suffers less dust extinction and may possibly detect the photosphere of the embedded protostar itself .",
    "previous efforts to estimate the binary mass in the near - ir have not had our spatial resolution .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimated the total embedded stellar mass at @xmath10.1 @xmath30 based on @xmath31 measurements",
    ". their value may be an overestimate of the mass as a significant amount of the @xmath31 flux seems to come from the bright ionization fronts of the proplyds , judging from our br@xmath11 image .",
    "therefore , we estimate the mass of protostars by comparing their @xmath2 magnitudes with stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the @xmath2 magnitudes are @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the major and the minor proplyd , respectively @xcite .",
    "estimating that half the radiation originates from the ionization front as seen in figure [ fig3 ] , we obtain absolute @xmath2 magnitudes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 pc ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the 1 myr dusty tracks of @xcite , given that the age of the orion nebula cluster is @xmath11 myr @xcite .",
    "we are likely to underestimate the true mass as we do not consider @xmath2 extinction .",
    "however , it should be mild due to small disk mass .",
    "our mass estimate is also consistent with the fact that we see no orbital motion in the h@xmath0 image .",
    "thus , lv 1 may comprise one very - low - mass star and one brown dwarf , or even two brown dwarfs .",
    "we list the properties of lv 1 in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "magnetic field is found to be energetically important in star formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "it provides extra support to slow down gravitational collapse of molecular clouds , influencing disk structure and planet formation .",
    "it also plays a major role in angular momentum transfer via jets and outflows .",
    "therefore , the morphology of ysos and the embedded magnetic field are deeply linked in a way that the observed features may help trace and constrain the field profile . in this section ,",
    "we estimate the location of the magnetopause of 168326 nw based on empirical relations , and show that the result well matches the observations .",
    "the standoff distance of magnetopause can be found by equating the ram pressure of stellar wind and the magnetic pressure , assuming a pure dipole field @xcite .",
    "however , plasma in the ism will also introduce its own magnetic field , making the dipole assumption invalid .",
    "therefore , we have to account for the contribution from the disk .",
    "we first notice that the field strength @xmath39 correlates with the number density @xmath40 .",
    "zeeman measurements have shown that @xmath41 over a wide range of number densities , from clumps of @xmath42 to dense cores of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the radial dependence of surface densities @xmath44 is ambiguous due to incomplete understanding of viscosity .",
    "different theories indicate scaling relations ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 @xcite . for simplicity , we consider a steady - state rotating disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "@xcite showed that in this scenario the surface density and the scale height @xmath2 have the relations : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the midplane gas temperature . assuming an optically thin surface with an optically thick midplane",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath49 scales as @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "these scaling relations are consistent with observations in the ophiuchus star - forming region , where thermal continuum measurements of dust grains show that @xmath54 and @xmath55 within a characteristic radius @xmath56 20200 au @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite also showed that in regions beyond @xmath57 the surface density often has an exponential taper , @xmath58 .",
    "we further notice that the electron number density outside of the ionization front decreases as @xmath46 @xcite . combining these relations , we find that magnetic field scales as @xmath59 for the inner disk , @xmath60 for the outer disk , and @xmath61 beyond the ionization front .    to determine the proportionality constant , we assume @xmath62 au for 168326 nw as it is a tiny proplyd .",
    "we also assume that its ionization front is at 20 au , judging from figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in addition , all brown dwarfs have a size similar to that of jupiter , and a @xmath28 young brown dwarf can have a strong magnetic field @xmath12 kg on its surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have this empirical formula : @xmath63 g for @xmath64 au .",
    "we finally equate the magnetic pressure with the ram pressure of stellar wind : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the mass density and the speed of stellar wind , @xmath68 is the mass loss rate , @xmath69 is the distance from the ionizing star , and @xmath70 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "the mass loss rate of @xmath4 ori c is @xmath1@xmath71 @xcite , and the wind speed is @xmath12500@xmath6 @xcite . substituting these numbers into the above equation , we obtain @xmath72 au , which is in reasonable agreement with the location of the bow shock ( @xmath1150 au ) in figure [ fig2 ] . this calculation , though oversimplified , demonstrates the possibility in applying the observed features of proplyds to constraining the magnetic field profile .",
    "we utilize the newly commissioned magao system to image the binary proplyd lv 1 in h@xmath0 .",
    "magao utilizes an adaptive secondary mirror to achieve a moderate strehl ratio in the visible .",
    "the sdi mode of the visao camera enables one to simultaneously observe the line emission and its adjacent continuum .",
    "we used @xmath4 ori f as the psf to perform deconvolution .",
    "various structures in lv 1 are identified , including the bow shock , the interproplyd shell , the ionization fronts , and the cometary tails .",
    "we find no significant orbital motion of the binary over @xmath118 yr , implying that the total masses are low .",
    "we also find a point source which could be the embedded protostar s photosphere in the lbt ao [ ] @xmath73 m continuum . assuming no extinction and converting @xmath2 photometry into stellar mass , we find that lv 1 may have one very - low - mass star with a brown dwarf secondary , or even be a double brown dwarf .    the magnetopause of 168326 nw is estimated to be 110 au from the proplyd , which reasonably agrees with the location of the bow shock seen in h@xmath0 .",
    "the morphology of proplyds may help understand the magnetic field strength and profile .",

    "we thank the whole magellan staff for making this wonderful telescope possible .",
    "we especially thank povilas palunas ( for help over the entire magao commissioning run ) .",
