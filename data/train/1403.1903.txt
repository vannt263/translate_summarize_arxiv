    "a common assumption when analyzing a stationary time series @xmath8 , is that @xmath9 is a causal linear process , that is , @xmath10 where @xmath3 is a sequence of i.i.d .  random variables with mean @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 .",
    "this assumption is based on the wold s decomposition , which states that if @xmath9 is stationary with mean @xmath11 and finite second moment , and is also purely non - deterministic , then the representation ( [ eq : linear ] ) always holds with @xmath13 a sequence of uncorrelated random variables ( @xcite  5.7 ) .",
    "the independence assumption of @xmath3 in ( [ eq : linear ] ) obliterates the higher - order dependence structure . in some applications ,",
    "linear processes provide good approximations , while in others , not , as in the case of the arch model for volatility data .",
    "the volterra process extends linear process by incorporating non - linearity .",
    "a ( causal ) volterra process with highest order @xmath14 is of the form @xmath15    to understand the importance of ( [ eq : volterra ] ) , suppose that the stationary process is @xmath16 for some regular function @xmath17 .",
    "then ( [ eq : volterra ] ) can be heuristically regarded as its @xmath14-th order taylor series approximation .",
    "the homogeneous polynomial - form expansion in ( [ eq : volterra ] ) and its continuous - time counterpart where the sums are replaced with integrals , was originally proposed by vito volterra ( see @xcite ) for modeling deterministic nonlinear systems , and later extended by norbert wiener ( see @xcite ) to random systems , which eventually lead to the well - developed theory of wiener chaos ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and the recent survey @xcite ) . in the context of approximation of stationary processes ,",
    "@xcite shows that any stationary process can be approximated in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions by a volterra process with @xmath18 s gaussian . some nonlinear time series models admit volterra expansions ( [ eq : volterra ] ) with @xmath19 .",
    "for example , the larch(@xmath20 ) model @xmath21 under suitable conditions admits the following volterra expansion ( see , e.g. , theorem 2.1 of @xcite ) : @xmath22    we are interested here in stationary processes that have _ long memory _ , or _ long - range dependence_. a common choice is a linear process in ( [ eq : linear ] ) with @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the _ memory parameter _ , and @xmath26 is some constant .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when @xmath0 is the stationary solution of the fractional difference equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the difference operator with @xmath29 being identity operator and @xmath30 being the backward shift operator , and @xmath31 is understood as a binomial series ( see , e.g. , @xcite chapter 7.2 ) .",
    "we note that such long - memory linear processes have an autocovariance decaying like @xmath32 as @xmath24 , and a spectral density exploding at the origin as @xmath33 as @xmath34 .    if one wants to consider a nonlinear long memory model , a natural choice is to have a volterra process ( [ eq : volterra ] ) with coefficients @xmath35 decaying slowly as @xmath36 tends to infinity , so that the autocovariance has a slow hyperbolic decay .",
    "the major goal in this paper is to study the limit of normalized partial sum of some long - memory volterra processes .",
    "when @xmath0 is a long - memory linear process , that is , a long - memory volterra process with @xmath37 , then the limit , as is well - known , is fractional brownian motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is polynomial of a long memory linear processes , that is , when @xmath38 in ( [ eq : volterra ] ) for some constant @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is large enough , then the limit is a hermite process of a fixed order ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such limit theorems involving non - brownian motion limits are often called _ non - central limit theorems_.    in this paper , we focus on volterra processes of a single order @xmath41 : @xmath42 which avoids possible cancellations between terms of different orders",
    ". note that the multiple sum ( [ eq : x(n ) ] ) _ includes _ diagonals , that is , it allows @xmath36 to be equal to each other . in the literature",
    ", one often considers multiple sums of the type ( [ eq : x(n ) ] ) where summation over the diagonals is _ excluded _ , which greatly simplifies the theory .",
    "although the exclusion of the diagonals is a typical theoretical assumption , it is , from a practical perspective , an artificial one . expression ( [ eq : x(n ) ] ) is the natural one since it includes all the terms .    to obtain a non - central limit theorem for ( [ eq : x(n ) ] ) , we assume that the coefficient @xmath43 behaves asymptotically as a homogeneous function @xmath44 on @xmath45 which is bounded excluding a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "we shall show that in this case , the limit of a normalized sum of centered @xmath0 is a linear combination of hermite - type processes of different orders .",
    "these hermite - type processes that appear in the limit were first introduced in @xcite , and were called in @xcite _ generalized hermite processes_. they live in wiener chaos , and extend in a natural way the usual hermite processes considered in the literature , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the limit , which is a linear combination involving different orders of multiple wiener - it integrals , can be re - expressed as a single _ centered multiple wiener - stratonovich integral _ with the zeroth - order term excluded .",
    "these integrals were introduced by @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , in contrast to the usual wiener - it integrals , the multiple wiener - stratonovich integrals include diagonals , and intuitively they are the continuous counterpart of the multiple sums in ( [ eq : x(n ) ] ) which , as was noted , do include diagonals .",

    ", the reader may want to have a look at this result , formulated as theorem [ thm : basic nclt ] , and also at the illustrative example [ eg ] .",

    "it is easy to see that the set of ghk(b ) functions on @xmath45 with fixed homogeneity exponent @xmath90 ( with the zero function added ) is closed under linear combinations and taking maximum or minimum .",

    "first , we have the following straightforward criterion for the @xmath125-well - definedness of @xmath124 :    [ pro : l^1 well - defined ] if @xmath126 , then @xmath124 in ( [ eq : diag poly ] ) is well - defined in the @xmath125-sense .",

    "we note that the formula ( [ eq : hu meyer ] ) was in fact known to wiener ( see ( 5.14 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a more general notion of trace than @xmath564 , called the limiting trace and denoted by @xmath570 ( see definition 2.3 of @xcite ) , involving tensor products of hilbert space .",
    "it is sufficient for our purpose to focus on the @xmath565-trace .",

    "hence the only way of getting terms that really contribute is to identify only pairs of the variables , which results in the form ( [ eq : hu meyer ] ) .    to express the limits in theorem [ thm : basic nclt ] in terms of wiener - stratonovich integrals ,",
