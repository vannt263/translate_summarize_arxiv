    "radio astronomy is poised to move ahead with a suite of new instruments such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "these instruments will improve sensitivity , resolution , bandwidth , and many other instrument and observational parameters by more than an order of magnitude . at present , many radio astronomy observations are corrupted to at least some extent by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "this interference comes from ground - based communication transmitters , satellites , and the observatory equipment itself . with the increase in sensitivity and frequency coverage of radio astronomy instruments , and with telecommunication signals occupying more of the spectrum ,",
    "it is essential to develop ways of removing or suppressing this rfi .    in radio astronomy",
    ", real - time adaptive filters can be used to modify an auxiliary voltage time series ( the reference signal ) so that it cancels rfi from an astronomical voltage time series @xcite . for each voltage sample",
    "the filters are allowed to slightly vary their internal coefficients in order to adapt to any changes taking place in the rfi .",
    "if one is interested in the power spectrum of the astronomy signal , and the filter coefficients stay fairly constant over the interval in which the power spectrum is estimated , cancellation in the post - correlation domain can give better results , since a second reference antenna can be used to give complete suppression of the rfi ( only zero - mean random receiver noise is added to the complex correlations and it will average away , see @xcite ) . however , many applications ( particularly in the communications field , but also some astronomy applications ) , require the recovery of the actual symbol stream ( i.e. , a transmitted sequence of symbols such as bits or words ) from the noisy rf environment , which is not retained in post - correlation . following a suggestion of @xcite ,",
    "we have devised a modified approach that can give improved rfi attenuation in the voltage domain . in an attempt to minimise any rfi in an astronomical voltage series the standard approach is to minimise the canceller s output power , which it will be shown means that some residual rfi always remains .",
    "the modified approach that we give here forces the rfi in the output power to zero .",
    "it results in residual power that is always greater than that of the standard approach ( output power is no longer minimised ) , but which does not contain rfi .",
    "that is , superior rfi cancellation is obtained , but at the expense of somewhat increased thermal noise .    in the following sections",
    "the standard adaptive canceller is discussed , and the new approach is introduced .",
    "this is followed by an overview of how cancellation can be applied after correlations are formed .",
    "residual rfi power and added receiver noise are investigated and an example from the australia telescope compact array is given .",
    "in an attempt to remain general , we assume a system of one or more radio antennae pointing towards a direction on the celestial sphere .",
    "delays are inserted into the signal paths so that a wavefront from the chosen direction arrives at the output of each antenna simultaneously .",
    "the celestial location is known as the phase tracking centre @xcite .",
    "given that we will attempt to deal with the interference in subsequent parts of the system , separate reference antennae are incorporated into the network of receivers to observe the rf environment , which typically enters the astronomy signal through the side - lobes of the antennae .",
    "signals from astronomy antennae will be referred to as main signals , and those from reference antennae as reference signals . at each antenna",
    "a waveform containing an additive mixture of all the signals present in the environment is received and downconverted to an if voltage series .",
    "this is sampled and quantised into a number of digital bits ( which we assume is sufficient to keep the voltage statistics linear so that quantisation effects such as intermodulation are negligible , and to ensure that the receiver noise and astronomy fluctuations are measured even in the presence of strong interference ) .",
    "each main if voltage series contains three components : a noise voltage from the receiving system , @xmath0 ; a noise voltage from the sky , @xmath1 ; and interference , @xmath2 .",
    "the sky voltage contains the information about the astronomical sources , which are the signals of interest .",
    "if the interference can not be removed completely , it is desirable to reduce it to less than the final rms noise level ( with a negligible  or at least predictable  effect on the astronomy , @xcite ) .",
    "since an interfering signal is usually incident from a direction other than the phase tracking centre , its wavefront will not be synchronous at the output of the different antennae .",
    "the geometric delay , @xmath3 , of antenna @xmath4  due to the physical separation of the receivers  represents the difference in arrival time of an interfering wavefront at antenna @xmath4 and an arbitrary reference point ( after accounting for the delay needed to track the selected field on the celestial sphere ) .",
    "as a signal passes through a receiving and processing system it encounters various convolutions and deconvolutions , so working in the frequency domain can offer a more intuitive basis for discussion . in the frequency domain the system can be represented by complex multiplications and divisions . a frequency - dependent coupling term , @xmath5 ,",
    "is used to describe the combined complex - valued gain of each receiver system and antenna to the interference , including any filtering ( time is included to account for the slow variations imposed as the rfi passes through antenna side - lobes ) . using upper case characters to denote frequency domain quantities , and keeping in mind that this spectral representation comes from fourier transforming each consecutive 1000 or so samples of the voltage series ,",
    "the signal in a quasi - monochromatic channel at frequency @xmath6 is    @xmath7    for main antennae and    @xmath8    for reference antennae .",
    "note that the phase term due to the geometric delay of the interfering signal , @xmath9 , has been kept separate from the @xmath10-terms ( time is also included here to account for changes as either the phase tracking centre or rfi transmitter direction change ) . to remain general",
    "the @xmath10-terms are kept as complex quantities , to allow for any effects on the phase that are not due to the geometric delay .",
    "it is assumed that there is only one interfering signal in a frequency channel ( see @xcite for a discussion of multiple interferers ) , and that there is negligible reference antenna gain in the direction of @xmath11 , i.e. , reference antennae do not measure signal from astronomical sources .",
    "these are important assumptions , but often quite reasonable ( the latter assumption is strengthened because the weak astronomy signal enters the reference antennae through side - lobes ) .",
    "however , statements made later in relation to the lack of effect of adaptive cancellers on the astronomy signal rely on the validity of the second assumption .",
    "if any astronomy signals leak into the reference series the achievable sensitivity , dynamic range , astronomy purity , etc .",
    ", will all be affected .",
    "for example , signal leakage could lead to the power of a strong self - calibration source changing as the canceller weights change .",
    "adaptive cancellers are usually applied to broadband if voltage samples in the time domain @xcite .",
    "( `` broadband '' here simply refers to the whole passband , rather than the quasi - monochromatic frequency channels . )",
    "while the adaptive canceller examples given throughout section [ an atca data example ] have been processed in the time domain , the following analysis is carried out in the frequency domain ( see @xcite ; and @xcite for descriptions of time domain implementation ) .",
    "the aim of adaptive cancellers in interference mitigation is to find the set of filter weights , * _ w _ * , which scale and phase shift each reference antenna frequency channel so that they best approximate the rfi in a main astronomy spectrum ( in the time domain delays are inserted into the signal paths so that positive and negative delays can be considered .",
    "so strictly speaking the cancellers are not truly real - time , the output is lagging in time by the length of the inserted delay . )",
    "so @xmath12 is a vector with a complex element for each frequency channel .",
    "figure [ mk1 adaptive cancellers ] shows schematically how such a canceller can be implemented , hereinafter referred to as a mark one ( mk1a ) canceller ( the `` a '' is added since we will be modifying the filter later ) .        throughout this paper it is assumed that the filter weights are varying slowly enough that they are approximately constant on the time scales used to calculate them ; typically less than a second .",
    "it is also assumed that the various signals are independent ( i.e. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are uncorrelated , and the receiver noise is independent for the different antennae , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are uncorrelated .",
    "the noise terms , @xmath17 , will not be independent for receivers used in low frequency instruments such as lofar , where they will be dominated by partially correlated sky noise . here",
    "we will only consider frequencies for which @xmath17 is dominated by uncorrelated noise , internal to the receivers . ) when these assumptions hold , the power in a single frequency channel at the output of the canceller is    @xmath18    where * denotes a complex conjugate and @xmath19 the expectation value .",
    "the explicit frequency dependency of the terms has been removed ( it is assumed that the channels are independent so that ( [ adaptive filter power ] ) can be applied to each frequency channel separately ) .",
    "if we set @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and assume that the complex gains , delays , and weights are constant over the time average , so they can be taken outside the average , then we can write    @xmath23    where @xmath24 represents the phase difference , @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ mk1 weight dependence ] ) highlights a critical point .",
    "minimising the output power reduces the _ combined _ power of the residual rfi and the inserted reference receiver noise .",
    "if there is reference receiver noise the rfi will never be completely cancelled @xcite .",
    "this is because both the interference and reference receiver noise are being weighted .",
    "the receiver noise of the main antennae and the astronomy signals , however , are not affected by the choice of weights and will pass through the canceller freely ( under assumptions of signal independence and zero reference gain towards astronomy sources ) .    to perform the minimisation of @xmath26",
    ", one can differentiate it with respect to @xmath27 and find the weights that set the derivative equal to zero .",
    "the surface of @xmath26 is a multidimensional ( positive ) quadratic surface that has a single minimum , so the weights that set @xmath28 must give the unique global minimum @xcite . alternatively",
    ", wiener theory tells us that the optimal weights ( known as the wiener - hopf solution ) , @xmath29 , which minimise the output power are also the weights that set the cross - correlation between the canceller output and the reference signal to zero ( @xcite , as indicated in figure [ mk1 adaptive cancellers ] ) :    @xmath30    so the weighting process takes the cross - correlation of the reference and main signals , which determines the correlated power and relative delay of the interference , and scales that by the auto - correlation of the reference signal .",
    "one can calculate these weights directly by calculating the correlations from short integrations , or they can be found adaptively by iteratively seeking and then tracking the weights that satisfy ( [ mk1 pre corr weights a ] ) .",
    "ideally the output of the canceller would consist of the astronomy signal and receiver noise .",
    "however , as mentioned above , since there is always some receiver noise in the reference signal , setting the correlation in ( [ mk1 pre corr weights a ] ) to zero can never remove all of the rfi .",
    "the rfi is played off against the reference receiver noise .",
    "if @xmath31 is the interference - to - noise power ratio of the reference signal , @xmath32 , the mean amount of residual output power ( power in addition to the main receiver noise and the astronomy , @xmath33 ) , is given by    @xmath34    it is clear from ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) that as @xmath31 approaches infinity ( no reference receiver noise ) the residual power goes to zero . if there is no rfi , @xmath35 will be zero and there will also be zero residual power ( the filter turns off )",
    "when @xmath31 is finite and non - zero the reference receiver noise term in the denominator of ( [ mk1 pre corr weights b ] ) biases the weights and some residual power will remain .",
    "what might not be so clear from an inspection of ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) is the statement made earlier that this residual power is a combination of reference receiver thermal noise added during cancelling and residual rfi that was not excised .",
    "another way to see this bias is to consider figure [ mk1 adaptive cancellers ] .",
    "thermal noise from the reference receiver is present in both inputs to the weight generation process ( in the @xmath36 term from the reference antenna and the @xmath37 term from the filter output , c.f .",
    "equation [ mk1 pre corr weights a ] ) .",
    "this will lead to a second non - zero - mean correlation product ( the first being the rfi ) . minimising",
    "the output power must be a trade - off between minimising the contributed reference receiver noise and the rfi , and as a result there will always be residual rfi .",
    "the total residual power given in ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) can be divided into the inserted reference receiver noise residual , @xmath38 , and the rfi residual , @xmath39 , such that    @xmath40    which are shown by @xcite to be    @xmath41    @xmath42    thus @xmath43 . to shed some light on the meaning of the relations in ( [ mk1 residuals a ] ) and ( [ mk1 residuals b ] )",
    ", we again interpret the process of output power minimisation as determining the weights that set the cross - correlation of the canceller output and the reference signal to zero .",
    "as @xmath31 increases , the rfi becomes the dominant signal in the cross - correlation , and the filter must concentrate on reducing the rfi power . as a result",
    "the proportion of the rfi that remains after cancelling decreases faster than the injected noise power . when @xmath44 noise starts to dominate and",
    "the filter will concentrate on reducing the contributed noise power .",
    "when @xmath31 goes to zero , the correlation is completely reference receiver noise , and the canceller turns itself off . when rfi dominates , most of the residual power is reference receiver noise , and when reference receiver noise dominates , most of the residual power is rfi .",
    "also , since the reference signal is being scaled in an attempt to match its own rfi to the rfi in the main signal , the larger @xmath45 is relative to @xmath46 ( for example using a reference antenna that is pointing directly at the interfering source ) , the smaller the scaling factor ( weighting amplitude ) and thus the amount of injected receiver noise .",
    "when @xmath47 and @xmath48 both of the residual terms drop off and extremely good results are achieved @xcite .      to remove the biasing effect caused by the reference receiver noise ,",
    "a second reference receiver can be used , as was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the rfi in the main spectrum is still estimated using a weighted version of the spectral channels from the first reference , but now the cross - correlation of the second reference signal with the canceller output is set to zero in order to find the weights .",
    "this mk2a canceller is shown in figure [ mk2 adaptive cancellers ] .",
    "it was mentioned in the previous section that the reference receiver noise is a component of both signals in ( [ mk1 pre corr weights a ] ) .",
    "zeroing this correlation results in minimum output power , but a non - zero rfi residual . correlating the canceller output against a second reference with uncorrelated receiver noise",
    "removes the bias . since the rfi is the only correlated signal , zeroing the cross - correlation results in zeroing the rfi",
    ". however , there is no built - in mechanism to guard against the amount of reference receiver noise contributed to the output .",
    "the amount added during cancelling must always be greater than the noise added by the mk1a canceller , since power is no longer minimised .",
    "the two references will be denoted @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so that    @xmath51    and we can again determine the weights that set the output - reference cross - correlation to zero :    @xmath52    as with the mk1a canceller the weights need to scale and phase shift reference signal @xmath53 so that its rfi component matches that of signal @xmath54 . here , however , the independent reference signal @xmath50 is used to give a true view of the scaling factor needed to match rfi levels .",
    "@xmath55 is only constrained by the rfi , since the receiver noise terms in @xmath56 are uncorrelated , and the rfi signal is entirely replaced with a weighted version of thermal noise from reference signal @xmath53 ( assuming that the various signals are uncorrelated and that the receivers are ideal and remain linear ) .",
    "while the noise in the weights will also increase the output power of the canceller , it is much weaker noise since the weights are averaged over many samples , and is not considered further here . when @xmath57 from ( [ mk2 pre corr weights ] ) is substituted into the equation for output power , @xmath58 ,",
    "the mean residual power is    @xmath59    as shown in @xcite .",
    "infinite attenuation of the rfi component has been achieved , but potentially a significant amount of system noise has been added during cancelling .",
    "compare ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) and ( [ mk2 residual power ] ) : as in ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) , when @xmath60 , the attenuation of the rfi signal in @xmath54 is very large . in this case however , any frequency channels with @xmath61 will end up with more unwanted power than they started with .",
    "the mk2a canceller does not turn itself off .",
    "the reference signal is boosted until its rfi matches the rfi in the main signal , regardless of the amount of receiver noise being added .",
    "note that @xmath62 does not affect the output power , provided there is enough rfi power in @xmath63 to keep the weights stable ( see section [ instabilities in the dual reference algorithms ] for a discussion of weight stability ) .",
    "if one is interested in the ( interference - free ) power spectrum of @xmath54 , the single reference antenna mk1a canceller output will contain less residual power .",
    "there are , however , advantages to the mk2a canceller .",
    "if one is concerned with retrieving a structured signal from a voltage series , random noise in the signal may not pose too much of a problem , but a structured rfi residual may detract from signal recovery .",
    "more relevant in radio astronomy is the case where one is looking for a structure in the power spectrum .",
    "the rfi remaining after mk1a cancelling will have features in the power spectrum , but if the ( amplified and filtered ) reference rfi , @xmath64 , is proportional to @xmath65 , equation ( [ mk2 residual power ] ) says that the noise contributed by mk2a cancelling will have the same spectrum as the input reference receiver noise ( apart from a constant scaling factor ) .",
    "it is also conceivable to remove the unwanted reference receiver noise from the auto - correlation of either canceller s output .",
    "this is discussed in the next section and can result in a mk2 canceller superior to the mk1 canceller for some applications .",
    "we now describe a double canceller setup that can be used to suppress the added reference receiver noise in the output astronomy power spectrum .",
    "if the main signal is duplicated before cancelling so there is an identical copy , the copy can be passed through a second canceller that uses different reference signals so that the noise added will be uncorrelated with the noise added to the first . when the two filtered copies are cross - correlated ,",
    "the main antenna receiver noise and astronomy will correlate as if the original signal has simply been auto - correlated , while the added reference noise power will average away with the radiometric factor ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "an important point to note about the mk2a canceller is that all of the noise added during cancelling is from the first reference receiver ( see equation [ mk2 residual power ] ) .",
    "the second reference is only used in setting the complex weights .",
    "so the second canceller can be made by interchanging the references .",
    "this setup will be called the mk2b canceller and is shown in figure [ indeprx mk2 ] . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "if the inr of the references are the same , the mean residual output power from the mk2b canceller is    @xmath67    which averages towards zero as the integration length is increased .",
    "similarly , if two references are used to create two independent mk1a cancellers for the two main signal copies , this gives the mk1b canceller shown in figure [ indeprx mk1 ] , and the mean residual output power becomes    @xmath68        equations ( [ mk2 indeprx ] ) and ( [ mk1 indeprx ] ) show that while @xmath69 should keep integrating towards zero , @xmath70 has a definite limit due to the rfi signal that remains after cancelling .",
    "however , one must be aware that in situations where the reference inr is very small the mk2 canceller does not turn itself off , and there are practical implementation issues that need to be addressed ( essentially , one may need to force the canceller to turn off ) .",
    "this is discussed in section [ instabilities in the dual reference algorithms ] .",
    "in this section the residual power equations given throughout section [ adaptive cancellers ] are demonstrated . note",
    "that while the plots for the dual - reference cancellers show the residual power as the reference interference - to - noise power ratio approaches arbitrarily close to zero , the algorithms in practice become unstable and need to be turned off .",
    "this point will be reiterated where appropriate in the discussion below .",
    "for the theory we have set @xmath71 , so that all of the output power displayed in this section is a combination of residual rfi and any reference receiver noise added during cancelling .",
    "figure [ residual power v btau 1 ] displays the proportion of residual power in the output signal after adaptive cancelling with mk1b and mk2b cancellers .",
    "the plot shows that the added reference receiver noise averages away as the integration length is increased .",
    "if single canceller systems were being considered , then since any noise added during cancelling is sent to an auto - correlator , the output power would remain constant ( i.e. , remain at the levels shown on the left hand side of figure [ residual power v btau 1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the mk1b canceller hits a limit when it reaches the residual rfi , but that the mk2b does not .",
    "values as a function of the number of samples used to average the noise down in the canceller output ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the three sets of solid and dashed lines are for @xmath31 values of 0.1 ( top ) , 10 ( middle ) , and 1000 ( bottom ) .",
    "solid lines indicate mk1b cancelling , dashed lines mk2b cancelling .",
    "the lines flatten when the residual rfi power level is reached.,width=321 ]    as @xmath31 decreases the normalised output power of the mk1b canceller levels off at 1 , so there is no cancelling taking place . on the other hand the mk2 canceller continues to insert more and more reference receiver noise in an attempt to match the reference rfi to the main signal rfi . even though the mk2b canceller always has the larger total residual power ,",
    "it is entirely zero - mean noise and averages out with the radiometric factor .",
    "again the reader should note that for low @xmath31 values the mk2 canceller can become unstable and requires an additional mechanism to turn off .",
    "figure [ residual power v inr ] shows contours of constant ( normalised ) output power as a function of @xmath31 and the number of samples , @xmath72 .",
    "figures [ residual power v inr]a and [ residual power v inr]b represent mk1a and mk2a cancelling respectively , and figures [ residual power v inr]c and [ residual power v inr]d represent mk1b and mk2b cancelling respectively .",
    "the amount of residual power in db is indicated by the grey scale and runs from -80 to 20 db .",
    "it is clear from figure [ residual power v inr]c that a constant rfi residual remains for all @xmath31 values after mk1b cancelling .",
    "the dashed line indicates the approximate line where the added reference receiver noise power has averaged down to expose the non - zero residual rfi power level .",
    "it is clear from figures [ residual power v inr]a and [ residual power v inr]c that an output power plateau is reached as @xmath31 becomes small for the mk1 cancellers .",
    "the residual power of the plateau is 0 db , and indicates that the canceller has turned off .",
    "in contrast , the mk2a canceller ( [ residual power v inr]b ) does not turn off and results in more output power than input rfi power for low @xmath31 levels . however , since the residual is entirely noise it averages down in a mk2b canceller , where two independent filters are used ( [ residual power v inr]d ) .",
    "this is highlighted further in the next section .",
    "we now demonstrate adaptive cancellation of real rfi impinging on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the rfi is a point - to - point microwave ( mw ) television link transmitted from a tv tower on a nearby mountain at 1503 mhz .",
    "the reference antennae were two orthogonal linearly polarised receivers on a small reference horn pointed in the direction of the mw transmitter , as described in @xcite . a linearly polarised receiver on a regular atca antenna , pointing at the sky and receiving the microwave link interference through the antenna side - lobes ,",
    "was used to collect the main signal .",
    "the rfi is polarised , and as long as all three receivers are at least partially polarised in the same sense as the rfi the cancellers will work correctly ( assuming that the polarisation cross - talk between the reference receivers is negligible so the receiver noise is independent ) .",
    "the received voltages were filtered in a 4mhz band centred at 1503 mhz , downconverted , and sampled with 4-bit precision .",
    "each of the cancellation techniques discussed has been applied to the mw data using matlab ( see the @xcite ) .",
    "all of the spectra shown were generated using 1024-point ffts .",
    "figure [ high inr mk1a spectrum ] shows the unfiltered and mk1a filtered power spectra of the main astronomy voltage series when large reference inrs were available .",
    "two synthetic astronomy signals have been added to the astronomy voltage series at 1503.0 mhz and 1503.2 mhz .",
    "what we want is to remove the rfi peak ( the 1 - 2 mhz wide peak centred at 1503 mhz ) from the main signal spectrum , leaving the broad , main antenna bandpass , and the astronomy .",
    "this is indeed what is seen , and similar results are achieved for all of the techniques discussed in this paper . since all of the techniques behave excellently when the reference inr is large , and any contributed reference receiver noise or residual rfi is much smaller than the main signals receiver noise level , it is difficult to compare them .     before and after mk1 cancelling with @xmath73 .",
    "two simulated cosmic signals were added at 1503.0 and 1503.2 mhz.,width=321 ]    figure [ reference spectra ] displays the power spectra of two reference signals that have had gaussian random noise injected into their sampled voltage series , to set @xmath74 at the centre of the mw band and zero at the edges .",
    "the reason for adding the fake receiver noise was to lower the inr and accentuate any residual rfi , as detailed in ( [ mk1 residuals a ] ) , ( [ mk1 residuals b ] ) , and ( [ mk2 residual power ] ) .",
    "plots of the power spectra of the main signal ( the one containing the astronomy ) , before and after the different cancellation techniques , are displayed in figures [ mk1 spectra ] through [ post - corr spectra ] .",
    "figure [ mk1 spectra ] shows unfiltered and mk1 filtered power spectra of the main astronomy voltage series .",
    "the two synthetic astronomy peaks have not been affected to any measurable level .",
    "the amount of residual power after mk1a cancelling is as expected from ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) .",
    "about twice as much power has been cancelled at the centre of the rfi peak by the mk1b canceller ( the added receiver noise in this case has a zero - mean cross - correlation ) , which is expected since @xmath74 .",
    "away from the centre of the peak , @xmath31 becomes smaller and the proportion of residual rfi increases ( which is why the residual rfi peak is flatter than the initial peak ) .",
    "no matter how long the integration is run this residual power will not decrease any further .",
    "that is , the canceller is operating in the horizontal region shown in figure [ residual power v btau 1 ] .",
    "before and after spectra for the mk2 cancellers are shown in figure [ mk2 spectra ] .",
    "as for the mk1 cancellers , the two synthetic astronomy signals have been left unaffected .",
    "it is clear from figure [ mk2 spectra]a that when @xmath44 the mk2a output residual power is greater than the input rfi power ( except when @xmath31 goes to zero , where the canceller was turned off , see section [ instabilities in the dual reference algorithms ] ) .",
    "this is clearly unsuitable and makes the situation worse .",
    "in contrast , the mk2b canceller ( figure [ mk2 spectra]b ) has removed the rfi peak down to the primary antenna s receiver noise level , indicating that the mk2a residual power was completely added noise and not residual rfi .",
    "the removal of the rfi was extremely successful , with only a slight increase in zero - mean noise at the primary receiver noise floor , as seen in figure [ mk2 spectra noise ] .",
    "b , with a @xmath75 mk2b spectrum overlaid .",
    "very little noise is added when @xmath75 , demonstrating the increase for the @xmath44 case.,width=321 ]    each spectral channel in the examples in this section was averaged for 15872 samples .",
    "this means that for the mk1b and mk2b cancellers the contributed reference receiver noise power will have averaged down by about a factor of @xmath76 , or about 20 db . since the mk2b canceller output has essentially the same noise spectrum as the mk2a canceller output , but averaged down , there has been about a 20 db reduction in unwanted power after mk2b cancelling at the centre of the rfi peak ( see figure [ mk2 spectra ] )",
    "this zero - mean noise would have continued to average down had we continued to integrate , and more attenuation would have been achieved .",
    "the mk1b canceller has only achieved around 6 db of attenuation , and this will not increase with a longer integration .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that we have inserted a substantial amount of noise into the reference voltages , which has also greatly lowered the achieved attenuation .",
    "an important final point to note is that , with the exception of the edges of the rfi peak ( where there are features associated with turning the filter off ) , figure [ mk2 spectra]a shows that the rfi is spread with essentially constant power over the rfi contaminated channels .",
    "this is because @xmath31 , which we recall is given by @xmath32 , is approximately proportional to @xmath65 , so that the spectral shape of the rfi cancels out of the residual power given in ( [ mk2 residual power ] ) .",
    "from an implementation point of view it is important to realise that in astronomy we are not usually seeking fast time - variable information such as modulation . in most astronomical applications",
    "the aim is to measure signal statistics since they are related to quantities such as cosmic flux density and visibilities as measured by arrays .",
    "these applications are generally either finding the auto - correlation of signals from a single antenna ( to measure the power spectrum of the astronomy signal ) , or the cross - correlation of signals from more than one antennae ( to measure the spatial coherence of the astronomy signal ) .",
    "see @xcite and various chapters of @xcite for an overview . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on the power spectra given by auto - correlations , however all of the techniques discussed can be generalised to work on cross - correlations .",
    "the upshot of only requiring signal statistics is that if the canceller weights are not changing appreciably over the 100 millisecond or so time interval that the statistics are measured over , then the algorithms can be applied to the statistics rather than each voltage series .",
    "this means that they are applied at a rate of hz to khz rather that mhz to ghz .",
    "it also means that if the new astronomical cross - correlators that are coming online for new and existing facilities have a few extra inputs for reference antennae , then no new filters need to be added to the signal paths , and the cancellation can be performed after the observation as part of post - processing . for a comparison of voltage cancellation and statistics",
    "cancellation for rfi signals that require filters with weights that are changing appreciably during an integration , see @xcite .",
    "the standard statistics canceller used in radio astronomy is a post - correlation version of the mk2b canceller discussed in section [ dual reference signal adaptive cancellers ] .",
    "if we use @xmath77 to denote the correlation between signals from antennae @xmath78 and @xmath4 , the quantity that is subtracted from the auto - correlation of antenna @xmath79 is determined from amplitude and phase closure relations @xcite :    @xmath80    since the reference signal does not contain any information about the astronomy signal , it will not be present in any of the quantities in ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) .",
    "the denominator removes the reference signal rfi s phase and amplitude information from the numerator , leaving information about the rfi in the signal from antenna @xmath79 , and zero - mean noise , since the expectation operators are not infinite in extent .",
    "when @xmath81 is subtracted from main signal power @xmath82 , the mean residual power is ( see @xcite )    @xmath83    as in ( [ mk2 indeprx ] ) .",
    "@xmath84 is shown in figure [ post - corr spectra ] .",
    "as long as the gain and geometric delay stay essentially constant over the time average , the `` pre '' and `` post '' correlation techniques are very similar ; @xmath85 .     before and after post - correlation cancelling .",
    "two simulated cosmic signals were added at 1503.0 and 1503.2 mhz .",
    "there are slight artifacts at the edge of the peak where @xmath86 and the canceller is turning off , as described in section [ instabilities in the dual reference algorithms].,width=321 ]    while in the last few sections an extreme case has be demonstrated ( that of a low reference inr ) , it does highlight major differences between the different cancellers . the main differences being that infinite rfi removal is theoretically possible for cancellers that use two reference signals , but not for single reference cancellers .",
    "it is also clear that when the weights are slowly varying , the post - correlation canceller is equivalent to the dual - reference mk2b canceller .",
    "another way in which the mk2b and post - correlation canceller techniques can differ is in their instabilities at low inr levels .",
    "equations ( [ mk2 pre corr weights ] ) and ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) have denominators that become zero - mean noise when there is no correlated rfi signal , which can lead to numerical errors .",
    "the coefficients of the single - reference techniques go to zero when the rfi becomes weak and the cancellers automatically turn off .",
    "these issues are discussed next .",
    "equations ( [ mk2 pre corr weights ] ) and ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) show that the dual - reference cancellers can have stability problems when @xmath87 . in frequency channels where the correlated interference is zero or very small ,",
    "( [ mk2 pre corr weights ] ) and ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) are noise dominated and can result in a division by zero ( or very close to zero ) .",
    "this can not occur in the mk1 cancellers since ( [ mk1 pre corr weights b ] ) goes to zero as @xmath88 and they turn off .",
    "a modified post - correlation canceller has been suggested by @xcite in which an extra term is added to the denominator of ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , which is an estimate of the noise power in the reference cross - correlation , and the prime indicates that @xmath81 has been approximated .",
    "the extra term @xmath91 stops the zero - mean fluctuations in @xmath92 from going too close to zero , while for large @xmath31 equation ( [ modified spectrum mk2 ] ) reduces to ( [ correction spectrum mk2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath91 introduces a small bias in a similar way to the mk1 cancellers , a relation equivalent to ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) , but with a much smaller bias , can be derived :    @xmath93    this will have both a noise and a rfi component , as in ( [ mk1 residual power ] ) , however , since the canceller is now biased like a mk1a canceller the added receiver noise term will not average away .",
    "@xmath94 reduces as @xmath95 multiplied by the number of samples in the time average .",
    "there is a similar problem for the pre - correlation mk2 adaptive cancellers . in the lag domain ,",
    "the division in ( [ mk2 pre corr weights ] ) becomes a multiplication by the inverse of a matrix with columns containing offset copies of the @xmath49-@xmath50 cross - correlation function @xcite .",
    "divisions by zero in the frequency domain due to interference - free frequency channels in @xmath92 are manifest in the reference lag matrix as singular values .",
    "one method of dealing with this is to use singular value decomposition to decompose the matrix into two orthonormal triangular matrices and one diagonal matrix ( see @xmath96 2.9 of @xcite ) .",
    "singular ( or near - singular ) values can be selected when the relevant diagonal matrix elements are less than a chosen threshold , such as @xmath97 .",
    "the singular parts of the matrix contain no information about the correlated signal and are removed from the decomposition matrices .",
    "the inverse matrix can then be reconstructed from the remaining parts of the three decomposition matrices , and it will not function in the rfi - free parts of the spectrum .",
    "interference cancelling using a single reference antenna can give excellent results when the reference signal interference - to - noise ratio is large , and there is more gain towards the interfering signal for the reference antenna than for the astronomy antennae .",
    "however , receiver noise in the reference signal means that a fraction of the interference will always remain after cancelling . a second reference signal can be used to remove the noise bias and give infinite interference attenuation , but a larger amount of reference receiver noise is added during cancelling . for pre - correlation systems , a dual canceller setup can be used to average the ( zero - mean ) receiver noise away , a process that comes automatically with post - correlation cancellers . a breakdown of the main properties for the different mitigation techniques is given in table [ summary table ] .",
    "it is important to note that even though the single - reference cancellers leave residual rfi , the residual may be extremely small and well below the rms noise .",
    "this occurs when the interference - to - noise ratios of the reference signals are very large , and the use of two references ( in pre - correlation systems ) might just add complexity to the system with little or no benefit .",
    "however , if maximum sensitivity is required , one should be aware that they will eventually reach a non - zero residual signal .",
    "using two reference signals to remove the reference receiver noise bias removes the inherent stability of the algorithms in situations where some or all of the frequency channels are interference - free .",
    "although there are applications in which the passband will always be entirely filled with rfi ( such as observations in the gps l1 and l2 bands ) , many interfering signals will only take up a part of the band . in these cases",
    "the algorithms need a mechanism to turn themselves off in the vacant frequency channels .",
