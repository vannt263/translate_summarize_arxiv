    "monitoring plant and animal populations is an important goal for both academic research and management of natural resources .",
    "successful management of populations often depends on estimates of their mean or total over a region .",
    "historically , this has been the purview of sampling theory using simple random sampling , stratified random sampling , etc .",
    ", which are design - based methods . for design - based methods ,",
    "sample units are chosen at random , measurements are made or observed from the sample units , and inference is derived from the inclusion probability for sample units ( i.e. , horwitz - thompson estimation ) . for overviews , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach developed in the early 1960 s called geostatistics includes methods such as block kriging @xcite , which also estimates a regional total .",
    "these methods rely on an assumption about a stochastic process that generated the realized observations , and are hence `` model - based . ''",
    "model - based inference relies on estimating parameters for the assumed model , and then forming probability statements ( confidence intervals , prediction intervals , etc . ) from the fitted model . in this paper",
    "we pursue the model - based approach because samples can not always be drawn randomly .",
    "in particular , we consider counts from aerial photographs , which are difficult and inefficient to randomize , with the basic problem being the estimation of the total count for a region .",
    "the goals and context of this paper are shown in figure  [ figregionssamples ] .",
    "the situation for block kriging is shown in figure  [ figregionssamples]a .",
    "let the spatial region of interest be @xmath0 .",
    "any particular location in @xmath0 is given by @xmath1- and @xmath2-coordinates contained in the vector @xmath3^\\prime$ ] , and the random variable at the @xmath4th location is denoted @xmath5 .",
    "we assume a spatial random field @xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "the set @xmath7 is continuous in space and hence infinite .",
    "we use the notation that for vector @xmath8 , @xmath9^\\prime$ ] , @xmath10 , so @xmath11 is euclidean distance between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 goes to one as @xmath16 , then @xmath17 will form a smooth ( differentiable ) but random surface .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 observed values from the random surface are contained in the vector @xmath19^{\\prime}$ ] ( the solid circles in figure  [ figregionssamples]a ) .",
    "block kriging uses a linear combination @xmath20 to predict the average or total in block @xmath21 ; @xmath22 , where this integral is assumed to exist ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "23 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pg.106 ) ) .",
    "the salient feature of block kriging is that a model of the autocorrelation of the spatial random field can be estimated from the point level data of the observations , and it is relatively easy to aggregate ( through the integral ) for an estimator of block @xmath21 .",
    "however , extensions to count data have been difficult because data are modeled on a transformed space but the integral is desired on the original space ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite develop maps from count data but do not attempt abundance estimates .",
    "counts are often obtained from plots , @xmath23 in figure  [ figregionssamples]b , that have substantial area , are in a regular grid , and exhaustively fill both @xmath0 and @xmath21 . here ,",
    "classical random sampling using design - based inferences are often employed , where a random sample of the observed count on the @xmath4th block , @xmath24 , are used to estimate a total . to correctly estimate variance ,",
    "a finite population correction factor is employed , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sample variance , @xmath27 is the fraction of sampled units ( @xmath18 ) to total sample units ( @xmath28 ) within @xmath21 , and @xmath29 is called the finite population correction factor . a model - based , finite - population version of block kriging for the situation shown in figure  [ figregionssamples]b was developed by @xcite . in the strict sense ,",
    "distance between samples is not well - defined because of the non - point nature of each sample @xmath23 .",
    "however , models of autocorrelation are often built in this case by using the centroid of each plot .",
    "the main problem considered by @xcite was that the traditional formulation of block kriging as shown in figure  [ figregionssamples]a assumed an infinite population .",
    "hence , if one were to estimate an autocorrelation model for figure  [ figregionssamples]b , and then apply standard block kriging formulas ( as has been done in the literature ) , there is no finite correction factor .",
    "for example , if we sampled all of the plots , then the prediction variance should be zero , but the traditional formulation of block kriging would have nonzero prediction variance .",
    "hence , a finite population version was developed by @xcite , and it performed well and had proper confidence intervals in a variety of situations @xcite .",
    "now consider the situation in figure  [ figregionssamples]c . here",
    ", we would like to use counts from samples with substantial area , @xmath24 , to predict at @xmath30 , but the sample units are not arranged in a regular grid that fills either @xmath0 or @xmath21 .",
    "classical random sampling would usually be employed in this situation , with an estimator of the total being @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total count divided by the sampled area , and the variance estimated by @xmath33 , where here @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the total area sampled .",
    "however , what if the samples @xmath36 are not randomly placed , and may in fact be in some regular pattern that does not form a regular grid that does not exhaustively fill both @xmath37 and @xmath21 ?",
    "the basic problem considered in this paper is the prediction of a total in region @xmath21 from a sample of @xmath38 as in figure  [ figregionssamples]c , where sampling at random is not possible .",
    "this is the case for counts from photographs taken from aircraft .",
    "the national marine mammal laboratory of the noaa - nmfs alaska fisheries science center developed aerial survey methods to estimate and monitor harbor seal populations in glacial fjords in alaska .",
    "we give more details next as a motivating example .",
    "to make the problem concrete , we consider an example that prompted the model development .",
    "aerial surveys were flown over the ice haul - out area of harbor seals in icy bay , alaska .",
    "ice emanating from tidewater glaciers provides a dynamic expanse of floating ice on which the seals whelp and nurse pups and rest during the molting season .",
    "the aerial platform , a twin - engine aero commander shrike , was flown at 1000 ft and ca .",
    "100 knots on transects with variable spacing that were oriented in two main directions to sample the two main arms of the bay ( figure  [ fig : studyarea ] ) , covering about 79 sq km .",
    "a vertically - mounted camera ( nikon d1x with a 60 mm lens ) captured an image approximately every 2 seconds through a portal , each covering about 80 @xmath39 120 m at the surface of the water .",
    "this firing rate , and the spacing of the transects , allowed for a gap between images of about 30 m end - to - end , and transects varied in spacing from side - to - side , but largely ensured that images were separated from each other ; i.e. , seals were sampled only once .",
    "the camera was usually turned off when flying over large areas of open water where hauled out seals would necessarily be absent .",
    "this survey was conducted on 20 may , 2004 , in the afternoon ( 1300 to 1430 hr ) when seals typically haul out in peak numbers .",
    "this is just one data set collected among dozens annually as part of a monitoring program for harbor seals .",
    "images were georeferenced and embedded as a raster layer in an arcgis @xcite project allowing individual seals to be spatially marked in a point layer by visually inspecting each image ( @xmath18 = 2080 images ) .",
    "footprints showing the extent of each image were generated as polygons ( figure  [ fig : studyarea ] ) in a separate layer and seal points were summed within and assigned to each centroid and exported for statistical analysis .",
    "the spatial extent of each image was assumed to be constant despite small random variation in altitude ( max : @xmath40 30 m ) during the survey .",
    "the total spatial extent of each day s survey effort , over which the intensity surface would be calculated , was delineated by creating a polygon that corresponded to : 1 ) the coastline of the bay ( shorelines from alaska department of natural resources line shapefiles ) , 2 ) an estimate of the location of the face of the glaciers ( by connecting points that marked the glacial terminus in each of the northernmost images from every transect , and 3 ) the extent of the ice field defined as the edge of the images where ice cover ( by area ) dropped to @xmath41 by visual estimation .",
    "areas of open water ( @xmath41 cover ) were delineated by `` donut - holes '' in the overall polygon where the spatial boundaries was defined by the outermost images in which ice cover increased to @xmath42 . in other words , to minimize problems with selection bias , any area that could not contain a seal was eliminated by creating the proper boundary .",
    "the 2080 images covered 25.3% of the study area . of the 2080 images ,",
    "180 of them had nonzero counts , so about 91% were zero .",
    "a total of 1002 seals were observed in the 180 plots .",
    "a maximum of 44 seals were counted in a single photograph .",
    "the data are summarized spatially in figure  [ fig : studyarea ] .",
    "most of the previous work in this area has used bayesian models .",
    "the literature has concentrated on producing smoothed maps of relative abundance , although going from those smooth maps to an abundance estimate would not seem difficult . in particular , @xcite developed poisson - lognormal models for a continuous surface , but the counts were at a scale that could be considered points , whereas we have counts in plots with substantial areas .",
    "@xcite used a tessellation to create spatial conditional autoregressive ( car ) models @xcite for neighbors as a spatial random effects model , with the car random effects constant within the tessellation , but the model retained point level data for covariates .",
    "@xcite model on a subsample of a systematic grid , and include detection models , but ultimately use a continuous poisson - lognormal model for counts .",
    "@xcite also use poisson - lognormal models with known covariates to model the intensity surface .",
    "note that none of these methods include a finite population correction factor , and while they are all very attractive , we do not adopt any of them for reasons that we describe next .",
    "based on this introduction , we desire a total abundance estimator from data like the motivating example that will satisfy several practical conditions .",
    "1 ) it must be fast to compute , robust , and require few modeling decisions , similar to classical survey methods .",
    "annually , we compute dozens of estimates for data like the example and , depending on the size of the fjord , each may have thousands of photographs .",
    "2 ) the estimator must use only counts within plots ; actual spatial locations of animals are unknown .",
    "3 ) we are interested in the actual number of seals , not the mean of some assumed process that generated the data .",
    "thus , the estimator must make use of the actual number of seals , and predict to those areas that are unsurveyed .",
    "4 ) the variance estimator should have a population correction factor that shrinks to zero as the proportion of the study area that gets sampled goes to one . in our real example",
    ", we surveyed approximately 26% of the study area ; in classical sampling , that directly reduces that variance by 26% . some fjords that we have surveyed are up to 50% sampled .",
    "5 ) the estimator should be approximately unbiased ( demonstrated through simulations ) , and we want valid confidence intervals that cover the true number of seals the correct proportion of times ; that is , we use this method dozens of times per year and desire confidence intervals in the frequentist sense .",
    "6 ) it appears that there is nonstationary variance throughout the area , with large areas of zero counts ( no seals ) . a variance estimator that accommodates this will be required .",
    "the goals of this manuscript are to develop an estimator to satisfy these criteria .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the estimator is developed from models for spatial point processes and generalized linear mixed models , so we begin with a brief review and then develop the estimator in section  [ sppestimator ] .",
    "we provide some simulations to validate the estimator and compare variance estimators in section  [ simexp ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : example ] we use the estimator on the motivating example of aerial photographs taken of harbor seals in a glacial fjord in alaska . we provide some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : discconc ] .",
    "from the introduction and motivating example , note that data are observed at an aggregated support level , but we need a model at the point support level .",
    "the reason should be clear ; because of the possibility of unbalanced spatial sampling ( figure  [ figregionssamples]c ) , and a real example of it ( figure  [ fig : studyarea ] ) , we need to predict and then integrate an abundance density surface continuously throughout the unsampled area . to achieve this",
    ", we develop a model - based estimator motivated by an inhomogeneous point process ( ipp ) that has been integrated to yield a poisson regression model .",
    "part of attraction of this framework is that it allows inference on point level support from data on areal support , and then we use the point level support model to make our abundance estimate .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the ipp , describe how abundance is related to the intensity surface , and then draw the connection to poisson regression .",
    "assume that locations @xmath43^\\prime$ ] of all individuals in @xmath21 , say @xmath44 , are the result of an inhomogeneous poisson process ( ipp ) with intensity function @xmath45 that varies with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a vector of parameters controlling the intensity function .",
    "the intensity function is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is expectation , @xmath50 is the total number of points in planar region @xmath0 , and @xmath51 is the area of @xmath0 . in general ,",
    "when analyzing ipp data , all of the individuals would be located within @xmath21 , and then inference about @xmath47 could be made by maximizing the point process log - likelihood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this is difficult in our case because @xmath21 can not be surveyed in its entirety and individual locations are unknown .",
    "for example , a simulated point pattern is shown in figure  [ fig : simulationexample ] , and the plots form a disjointed window on the point pattern that is masked in the areas between the plots , and although we show the point locations within plots , we assume we only have a count for each plot . ultimately , we will need to estimate the intensity function , but for now we proceed assuming that we have an estimate of the intensity function in the area between plots , as shown in figure  [ fig : simulationexample ] .      the primary quantity of interest is the abundance in a particular block @xmath52 . because the distribution of individuals is random under the model - based paradigm , there are two types of abundance to consider .",
    "first is the _ expected _ abundance in @xmath21 , @xmath53 , and then there is the _ realized _",
    "abundance @xmath54 for a given realization of @xmath55 from @xmath45 . assuming an inhomogeneous point process , @xmath56 , which is poisson distribution with mean @xmath57 .",
    "an estimate of the _ expected _ abundance is @xmath58 , which is often based on plug - in methods from estimates @xmath59 of @xmath47 ; i.e. , @xmath60 .    for an estimate of the realized abundance",
    ", consider that the total abundance can be partitioned into observed and unobserved .",
    "assume there are @xmath18 sample units @xmath61 , and let @xmath62 .",
    "note that some @xmath23 could be outside @xmath21 but within @xmath0 .",
    "it is also possible that some @xmath23 straddle the boundary of @xmath21 , though we will not consider that problem here .",
    "the region within @xmath21 that was not sampled is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the complement of @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 is the number of observed points and @xmath67 the number of unobserved points and @xmath68 .",
    "the total @xmath54 involves predicting @xmath69 , where @xmath70 . by substituting @xmath59 for @xmath47",
    ", one can use the estimator @xmath71 , and , without any observations from @xmath72 , we use the mean as a predictor @xmath73 .",
    "hence an estimator of the total is @xmath74 for making inference to the realized abundance @xmath54 .",
    "note that , as @xmath75 , then @xmath76 , so an estimator of this form satisfies condition 3 in section  [ sec : goalsorg ] .",
    "making such inferences involves first estimating the intensity function @xmath45 , and also incorporating the uncertainty of estimating @xmath45 .",
    "so our immediate goal is to infer @xmath45 from data on areal support , which we describe in the next sections .",
    "suppose that we have a smooth spatial surface @xmath45 that varies with spatial location @xmath46 and is controlled by parameters @xmath47 ; this is the intensity surface .",
    "this surface may be integrated over some compact region , such as the plot @xmath23 , and this forms the mean of an ipp .",
    "let @xmath36 be a random variable for a count in @xmath23 , then @xmath77 , where @xmath78 now , let @xmath12 be the centroid of plot @xmath23 . if the area of @xmath23 is small compared to the survey area @xmath21 , and if @xmath79 is smooth ( i.e. , changing slowly within @xmath23 ) , then @xcite show that a reasonable approximation for ( [ eq : mubi ] ) is , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the area of @xmath23 .",
    "this is an important assumption and is part of the general problem of change - of - support ; see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) and @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite shows an early attempt at creating a continuous surface from count data in census tracts .",
    "the mean of @xmath36 can then be modeled with a log link function , forming a glm with offset @xmath82 , @xmath83 now we use spatial radial - basis functions to model @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the centroid of plot @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a vector of covariates at location @xmath12 and @xmath87 is a parameter vector of fixed effects .",
    "the spatial basis functions will form the values of @xmath86 .",
    "there has been increasing interest lately in spatial models that use radial basis functions .",
    "suppose there is a set of fixed points in the study area , @xmath88 , called `` knots . ''",
    "let @xmath89 be a row vector where the @xmath90th item contains a radial basis function value @xmath91 .",
    "for example , we will use @xmath92 , which is a gaussian basis function .",
    "a flexible surface is created by taking a linear combination of the radial basis functions .",
    "the surface value at location @xmath12 depends on parameters @xmath87 and @xmath93 as @xmath94 , and we attach the subscript to show that values in @xmath95 depend on @xmath93 . using radial basis functions can be viewed as a semiparametric approach to spatial modeling @xcite , and they have been used for models with non - euclidean distance measurements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and for computational efficiency for large data sets @xcite .    to make the model more flexible , following @xcite , we considered radial basis functions at two scales .",
    "let the `` coarse '' scale knots be @xmath96 .",
    "let the fine scale knots be @xmath97 , where generally @xmath98 .",
    "note that @xcite use 3 scales with approximately 3 times as many knots at the next finer scale . here , because we only have two scales , we use 4 times as many knots at the finer scale .",
    "the knots are generally spread out more or less regularly throughout the study area ; more details on an algorithm for knot locations are given in section  [ sec : knots ] .",
    "consider the log - linear model @xmath99 where @xmath100 $ ] , @xmath101^{\\prime}$ ] , @xmath102 $ ] , @xmath103 $ ] and the @xmath90th column of @xmath104 has @xmath105 as the @xmath4th element , and the @xmath90th column of @xmath106 has @xmath107 as the @xmath4th element .",
    "we will not consider any covariates in our model , allowing all spatial variation to be modeled through the spatial basis functions , although future development could easily accommodate covariates here . from ( [ eq : loglambda ] ) , we only consider an overall constant , @xmath108 .",
    "also , we assume all plots are the same size , @xmath109 .",
    "then we can write , @xmath110 where @xmath86 is the @xmath4th row of @xmath111 .",
    "model ( [ eq : logmubipoint ] ) will form the basis for estimation and prediction throughout the rest of this paper .      to place coarse scale knots , a systematic grid of points",
    "was generated within @xmath21 , and k - means clustering @xcite on the coordinates was used to create @xmath112 groups . because k - means clustering minimizes within - group variance while maximizing among - group variance , the centroid of each group tends to be regularly spaced ; i.e. , it is a space - filling design that can work well when the region @xmath21 has an irregular boundary , as in our example data set ( section  [ sec : motivate ] ) .",
    "we also used k - means clustering placing @xmath113 fine scale knots , but the systematic grid was generated within a minimum convex polygon that contained all non - zero counts intersected with @xmath21 ; this polygon was defined on the centroids of plots with nonzero counts , and an example can be seen in figure  [ fig : simulationexample ] .",
    "we found that this helped ensure convergence of the algorithm . if there are too many basis functions with a small range centered in a large area that is all zeros , the fitting algorithm that we describe next would fail to converge .",
    "the effect of knot numbers , both @xmath112 and @xmath113 , are examined in the simulation experiments in section  [ simexp ] .",
    "other methods for spatial knot placement could be used ; for example see @xcite .",
    "the software proc glimmix @xcite generates spatial knots using vertexes of a k - d tree @xcite . regarding the number of spatial knots , (",
    "255 ) recommend @xmath114 , with no less than 20 and no more than 150 .",
    "recall that the @xmath4th plot @xmath23 is very small in relation to @xmath21 , and we let @xmath12 be the centroid of the @xmath4th plot .",
    "the count in the @xmath4th plot is random , denoted @xmath36 , and starting from an inhomogeneous poisson process , from ( [ eq : logmubipoint ] ) we assume that @xmath36 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath115 .",
    "this is poisson regression , more generally formed as a generalized linear model ( glm ) @xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath117 , and @xmath118 and @xmath47 were defined following ( [ eq : mixmod ] ) .",
    "conditional on fixed @xmath119 values contained in the @xmath111 part of @xmath118 , iteratively weighted least squares ( iwls ) @xcite provides maximum likelihood estimation for @xmath47 .",

    "this optimization routine over just two parameters , @xmath119 , converges quickly and can use existing poisson regression software for the iwls update , so it satisfies the speed requirement of condition 1 in section  [ sec : goalsorg ] . to help ensure convergence , we constrained @xmath123 to be between 0.5 and 3 times the minimum distance between any two knots in @xmath124 , and constrained @xmath125 to be greater than @xmath123 but less than 3 times the minimum distance between any two knots in @xmath126 .",

    "this connection is important because , in section  [ sec : varest ] , we use results from maximum likelihood estimation of the janossy density in ipp literature to obtain variance estimates . note that other approaches may be taken , including penalized splines @xcite or bayesian approaches ( see section  [ sec : prevwork ] ) .",

    "animals ( as well as other spatially patterned points ) are often clustered at very fine spatial scales . for animals",
    ", this might occur as mother - offspring pairs , clustering around locally desirable habitats , etc .",
    "the inhomogeneous intensity surface estimated in the foregoing discussion will be unlikely to capture this fine scale clustering , which will contribute to the overall variance , and without considering it , the confidence intervals on abundance estimates will be too short . various estimators of overdispersion for count models have been proposed , and the negative binomial and quasi - poisson are commonly used ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; see @xcite for an overview . here , we consider quasi - type models , where , if the mean is @xmath169 , then the overdispersion is constant multiplier , @xmath170 , so the variance is @xmath171 .",

    "examples of the overdisperson estimators are shown in figure  [ fig : residdisp ] , which were taken from the data seen in figure  [ fig : simulationexample ] .",
    "the traditional estimator can be viewed as a constant fit ( the average value ) through all of the squared pearson residuals for all fitted values , so this is shown as a horizontal solid line , the one that is below the short - dashed line ( whose value is constant at one ) in figure  [ fig : residdisp]a .",
    "note especially the wide divergence in squared pearson residuals for low expected values .",
    "this is not surprising because we are dividing by very small numbers , so any count greater than zero will have a very large residual .",

    "we investigated this by simulating ( [ eq : thata ] ) using @xmath168 from ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) as estimated from various data sets . in all cases , ( [ eq : thata ] ) was skewed , and a log transformation made the distribution approximately normal .",

    "overall , our method worked well , especially when using some of the newly introduced overdisperion estimators .",
    "one of the main contributions of this manuscript was the introduction of overdispersion estimators when the overdispersion appears to be varying spatially ( a nonstationary overdispersion ) .",

    "in retrospect , that may not seem surprising , but we have not found it reported in the literature .",
    "for that reason , we created spatially restricted knots over areas with non - zero values ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : simulationexample ] ; also see figure  [ realdatafittedsurface ] ) . for placing knots",

    "<S> monitoring plant and animal populations is an important goal for both academic research and management of natural resources . </S>",
    "<S> successful management of populations often depends on obtaining estimates of their mean or total over a region . </S>",
    "<S> the basic problem considered in this paper is the estimation of a total from a sample of plots containing count data , but the plot placements are spatially irregular and non randomized . </S>",
    "<S> our application had counts from thousands of irregularly - spaced aerial photo images . </S>",
    "<S> we used change - of - support methods to model counts in images as a realization of an inhomogeneous poisson process that used spatial basis functions to model the spatial intensity surface . </S>",
    "<S> the method was very fast and took only a few seconds for thousands of images . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted intensity surface was integrated to provide an estimate from all unsampled areas , which is added to the observed counts . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method also provides a finite area correction factor to variance estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity surface from an inhomogeneous poisson process tends to be too smooth for locally clustered points , typical of animal distributions , so we introduce several new overdispersion estimators due to poor performance of the classic one . </S>",
    "<S> we used simulated data to examine estimation bias and to investigate several variance estimators with overdispersion . </S>",
