    "it has been suspected for many years that the high mach number , collisionless shocks of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) do not produce electron - ion temperature equilibration .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot relations require that for very high mach numbers the temperature for each particle species @xmath4 : @xmath5with @xmath6 the particle mass , @xmath7 the shock velocity , and @xmath8 the ratio of specific heats , usually taken to be @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the heating process in collisionless shocks is not well understood , but the coulomb collision times are too long to provide the required heating .",
    "so other , collective , processes should be responsible for the heating .",
    "this raises the question whether the heating process leads to temperature equilibration or not , i.e. is the electron temperature very low compared to the proton temperature , which , according to ( [ eq - shocks ] ) , should be lower than the oxygen or iron temperature ?",
    "if temperatures are not equilibrated at the shock front , and subsequent equilibration proceeds through coulomb interactions , full equilibration takes @xmath10  s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a clear hint for non - equilibration is the low electron temperature in young snrs , which in no object seem to exceed 5  kev , whereas a typical shock velocity of @xmath11  km / s should give rise to a mean plasma temperature of 19  kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray observations usually allow only the electron temperature to be determined from the continuum shape and line ratios .",
    "the ion temperature is difficult to measure , as it does not alter the continuum shape , and hardly influences the ionization and excitation balance .",
    "some measurements of temperature non - equilibration based on optical and uv spectroscopy have been reported .",
    "the shock velocity and amount of electron - proton equilibration can be determined from the line widths and ratio of h@xmath12  and h@xmath13 emission from non - radiative shocks .",
    "for the northwestern shock front in sn  1006 , which is also the subject of this letter , @xcite measured a shock velocity from the h@xmath12   width of @xmath14  km / s and inferred an electron to proton temperature ratio @xmath15 . together with the measured proper motion @xcite were able to determine a distance to sn 1006 of @xmath16  kpc .",
    "uv spectra obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope showed broad c  iv , n  v and o  vi lines , indicating temperature non - equilibration of these elements @xcite , and a comparison of these line intensities with he  ii allowed a measurement of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of sn  1006  indicate a low value of typically @xmath18  @xcite , implying that if the equilibration is governed by coulomb interactions , the plasma did not have sufficient time to equilibrate .    here",
    "we report on a direct x - ray measurement of the o  vii temperature in the northwest of sn  1006 .",
    "it confirms with a high statistical confidence the slow equilibration of electron and ion temperature , but for a position further downstream from the shock than for the optical and uv measurements .",
    "we observed sn  1006  ( g327.6 + 14.6 ) with the _ xmm - newton _  x - ray observatory @xcite with the goal of measuring the ionization and equilibration in sn  1006 .",
    "the two observations are part of the guest observer program and were made on august 10 and 11 , 2001 .",
    "one observation pointed on the bright knot in the northwest , the main topic of this _ letter _ , the other on the narrow filaments in the east of sn  1006 .",
    "the exposure times varied per instrument , but were close to 60  ks for both observations . in order to produce fig .",
    "[ fig - prof ] we also used additional archival _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  data .    our main result is obtained with the reflective grating spectrometer ( rgs , * ? ? ?",
    "the two rgs instruments , rgs1 and rgs2 cover the wavelength range of @xmath19   , with a first order resolution of @xmath20 at 20   .",
    "emissions from different orders are separated using the intrinsic energy resolution of the ccds .",
    "unfortunately one ccd chip on the rgs1 and one on the rgs2 no longer function . as a result",
    "the rgs1 spectrum does not cover the wavelength range encompassing ne line emission , and the rgs2 does not cover the wavelength range around 22   , which contains the o  vii he@xmath12 line emission .",
    "we limited the extraction region to an 1  wide strip across the bright northwestern knot .",
    "the extended emission from sn  1006  means that the standard response matrices had to be convolved with the spatial emission profile displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - prof ] , with an attenuation due to off - axis telescope vignetting .",
    "the bright knot has a spatial width of 0.4  ( fwhm ) , which gives an apparent spectral broadening of @xmath21 ( fwhm ) , or @xmath22 at 21.6   . the intrinsic resolution of the rgs is @xmath23  @xcite . as the knot is compact and close to the edge of sn  1006  it is unlikely that any measurable broadening is due to bulk motions along the line of sight .    _",
    "xmm - newton _  also has ccd cameras behind each of its three mirrors , called the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",
    "we use the spectra extracted from the epic data to measure the electron temperature and abundances .",
    "all standard data reductions and response matrix calculations were done with sas 5.3.3 .",
    "background spectra for the epic data were taken from a region outside sn  1006 , but close to the center of the field .",
    "as rgs background spectra we used archival data of targets with no apparent line emission , such as gamma ray bursts .",
    "the measurement of the non - equilibration of the electron and ion temperatures requires the measurement of both the ion temperature , here oxygen temperature , and the electron temperature .",
    "the electron temperature is in this case most accurately measured from the spectral continuum shaped observed with the epic ccd spectra , as the low ionization time scales in sn 1006 make the available line ratios only weakly temperature dependent .",
    "the epic spectra from the northwestern knot were fitted with the _ spex_non - equilibration ionization ( nei ) code @xcite .",
    "as the knot is relatively compact , temperature and ionization gradients are probably of minor importance .",
    "the plasma parameters obtained by fitting the spectra indicate @xmath24 , and @xmath25@xmath26  kev , higher than the @xmath25@xmath270.7  kev reported by @xcite based on _ chandra _  data .",
    "note , however , that the _ chandra _  spectra have a lower spectral resolution , and have currently more calibration problems .",
    "moreover , as there are two different kind of epic instruments , we were able to verify the consistency of the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig - epic ] ) . nevertheless , the measured @xmath25  is substantially lower than the @xmath28  kev expected for a fully equilibrated plasma , but still higher than that expected from coulomb equilibration alone behind a 3000 km / s shock .",
    "[ fig - eq ] shows the predicted @xmath25  against @xmath29  for current observations of the sn 1006 knot , as well as the various ion temperatures .",
    "our fitted @xmath29  corresponds to plasma shocked 200 - 300 years ago , which is predicted to have @xmath30  ev .",
    "hence we infer a small degree of collisionless electron heating ( around 5% of the shock energy , i.e. @xmath31 , see @xcite ) consistent with optical and uv observations @xcite of sn 1006 and with observations of high mach number shocks in other supernova remnants such as tycho @xcite and sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the spectra are dominated by line emission from o  vii , the other line complexes are , however , not from helium - like stages of ne , mg and si , as identified by @xcite , but from lower ionization stages . for instance the epic spectra show consistently that the mg line centroid is @xmath32  kev , whereas the mg xi line centroid is @xmath33  kev .",
    "the si line centroid is @xmath34  kev , which differs significantly from the si xiii centroid of 1.85  kev .",
    "instead these centroids indicate ionization stages around mg ix and si ix .",
    "the ne centroid , as determined from the rgs2 spectrum , indicates @xmath35  kev , consistent with ne  vii .",
    "these centroids provide clear evidence for extreme nei conditions for the northwestern knot and corroborate the measured @xmath29  value .",
    "in agreement with @xcite we find that the knot emission indicates an overabundance of si , but contrary to the _ chandra _  data we do find o , ne and mg to be somewhat underabundant ( table  1 ) .",
    "this may indicate that instead of shocked ism the knot is actually ejecta or ism mixed with ejecta .",
    "this does not diminish the evidence for temperature non - equilibration , but it makes it harder to combine the results reported here with the h@xmath12 shock velocity measurements .    the rgs1 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rgs ] ) shows that the emission around 0.66  kev is dominated by o  vii he@xmath13  emission ( o  viii ly@xmath36o  vii he@xmath37 ) .",
    "ne is detected in the rgs2 spectrum , but mg and si are too weak for the rgs instruments .",
    "no evidence for fe  xvii line emission is seen at 15.01   , 16.78   , 17.0   , or 17.10   , presumably because fe has not yet reached the fe  xvii charge state .",
    "the o  vii emission is well described by @xmath38 , line ratios that scale with the ratios of the oscillator strengths , as is expected for @xmath25  @xmath39  kev .    in order to measure the ion temperature through the thermal doppler broadening we fitted the rgs1 spectrum in the range from @xmath40   , dominated by oxygen line emission , with six absorbed gaussians and a bremsstrahlung continuum with @xmath25@xmath41",
    "kev fixed to the continuum outside the fitted range ( @xmath42  @xmath43 , * ? ? ?",
    "the six gaussian components had centroids fixed at the energies of the bright o  v , o  vi , and o  vii lines .",
    "the ratios of those lines were fixed according to calculations with the fac atomic code @xcite , for @xmath25@xmath41  kev and a grid of @xmath29  values between @xmath44 .",
    "the line broadening was taken to be proportional to the line energies .",
    "spectral fitting was done with spectral fitting package _",
    "xspec _  @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to use the c - statistic , which is the maximum likelihood statistic appropriate for poisson noise @xcite .",
    "the best fits corresponded to @xmath45 with a maximum likelihood statistic of @xmath46 for 104 data bins , with a possible range of @xmath47 .",
    "this is somewhat lower , but arguably more accurate , than the value derived from the ccd spectra .",
    "it is also consistent with the measured oxygen ly@xmath12  to he@xmath13ratio with the rgs .",
    "for higher value of @xmath48 the emission would be much more dominated by the o  vii resonance line at 21.6   , whereas the rgs1 spectrum indicates a substantial contribution of forbidden line emission at 22.1    due to o  vi inner shell ionization and excitation .",
    "the line broadening needed to obtain an acceptable fit is @xmath49  ev ( 68% confidence ) , if fitted within the wavelength range 21.4 - 22.6   . as fig .",
    "[ fig - rgs ] shows the broadening underpredicts the wing of the resonance line between 21.0 - 21.4   , which is a possible indication that the oxygen ions may not be completely thermalized ( i.e. are not fully described by a maxwellian distribution ) .",
    "the statistical confidence of the detection of line broadening is at the @xmath50  level ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the 99.73% ( 3@xmath52 ) confidence range is @xmath53  ev .",
    "even if we do not fix the line ratios and optimize each individual line , we obtain @xmath54  ev with a statistical confidence still at the @xmath55  level . during our analysis",
    "we have compared different methods of analyzing the data , with various wavelength fitting ranges .",
    "this has given us some feeling of the systematic uncertainties involved .",
    "we estimate that the systematic error on @xmath56 is about 0.7  ev .",
    "our analysis of ccd and grating data of a bright knot in sn  1006  obtained by _ xmm - newton _   shows that @xmath25@xmath57  kev and @xmath47 the doppler broadening at 574  ev is @xmath58  ev , which corresponds to an oxygen temperature of @xmath59  kev ( e.g. eq .  10.69 * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates a shock velocity of @xmath60  km / s , if no significant temperature equilibration has taken place , but allowing for the possibility of some adiabatic cooling ( eq .  [ eq - shocks ] ) . the implied shock velocity is higher than the @xmath61  km / s indicated by recent h@xmath12  measurements @xcite , but given the systematic errors both measurements agree .    the excess emission in the wings of the o  vii line emission ,",
    "although possibly due to calibration uncertainties concerning the wings of the intrinsic rgs line profiles , may also be real and caused by a lack of complete oxygen thermalization .",
    "this is not unexpected as the oxygen self equilibration time at high temperatures is comparable to the oxygen - proton equilibration time .    to conclude , the measured high oxygen ion temperature is a clear indication that the shock heating processes resulted in only a small degree ( 5% ) of electron - ion equilibration at the shock front , and that the subsequent equilibration process is slow .",
    "this also has some bearing on the acceleration of cosmic rays in high mach number shocks , which are thought to be injected into the shock acceleration process from the pool of the thermal gas behind the shock front .",
    "a low electron - ion equilibration will make it relatively more difficult for electrons than for ions to be accelerated .",
    "however , the southwestern and northeastern limbs of sn  1006  are a prime examples of efficient electron acceleration as the x - ray emission from these parts is dominated by synchrotron emission @xcite . although we could not directly measure the electron temperature at those sites , the electron temperature close to the northwestern limb seems to be similar to that of northeastern knot .",
    "however , the notion of a thermal pool from which particles are accelerated is likely to be too simple , as recent simulations seem to indicate @xcite .    we thank john peterson for making to us available his monte carlo code which helped us verify the validity of our results .",
