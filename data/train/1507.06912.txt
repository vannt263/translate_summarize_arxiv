    "the standard model ( sm ) , if extrapolated up to extremely high energies by means of its renormalization group ( rg ) equations , reveals a rather peculiar property : the electroweak vacuum does not correspond to the configuration of minimal energy ; contrarily , it is a metastable state close to a phase transition  @xcite .",

    "however , this result relies on the assumption that thermal effects , due to non - zero values of the temperature , are neglected .",
    "the impact of thermal corrections on the computation of the tunneling probability was intensively discussed in the past  @xcite . intuitively , thermal fluctuations at finite temperature increase the tunneling probability , and the easiest way to visualize their role is to think about the analogy with the one - dimensional quantum mechanical system of a particle in a potential with a false ground state .",

    "as already noticed in  @xcite , therefore , the fate of the sm and its cosmological history are inextricably linked .",
    "a crucial question now seems to be : what was the highest temperature ever recorded in the early universe after inflation ended ? on a general ground , one could be inclined to think that it must have been very high . let us provide one example in the context of thermal leptogenesis and neutrino mass generation via type - i seesaw  @xcite . on the one hand , in order for baryogengesis to proceed via leptogenesis the mass scale @xmath151 of the sterile neutrinos must be of the order of @xmath152 gev or larger  @xcite ; on the other one , in order to produce thermally the heavy neutrino states a reheating temperature of the universe after inflation of @xmath153 is required .",
