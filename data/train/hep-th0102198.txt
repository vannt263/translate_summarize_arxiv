    "there has been something of an evolution in our ideas about how a d - brane should be considered . for the purposes of this paper we are interested only in the even - dimensional branes in a type ii string ( so - called `` b - branes '' ) .",
    "the sequence of a ideas have progressed roughly as follows    1 .",
    "a d - brane is something on which an open string may end .",
    "2 .   a d - brane is a @xmath0 gauge theory living on a subspace with scalar fields spanning the normal bundle .",
    "a d - brane should be viewed as coming from k - theory @xcite .",
    "a d - brane should be viewed as an object of the derived category of coherent sheaves @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we could also add that for non trivial @xmath1 field a d - brane should be viewed as an object of the derived category of sheaves of modules over an azumaya algebra @xcite .",
    "we will assume @xmath1 is trivial and so view d - branes as an object of the derived category of coherent sheaves .",
    "we will consider our target space to be a  threefold @xmath2 and we denote the derived category in question as @xmath3 . for the purposes of this paper",
    "we ignore any issues concerning the stability of d - branes .",
    "our d - branes , which are objects of @xmath3 , were called `` topological d - branes '' in @xcite where issues of stability were discussed .",
    "the reason that @xmath3 is `` better '' than k - theory is that it contains so much more information .",
    "for example _ any _ 0-brane on @xmath2 corresponds to the same single element of k - theory whereas the object of @xmath3 corresponding to a 0-brane knows _ where _ this point is .",
    "that is , k - theory measures the charge of the d - brane but @xmath3 tells us more and possibly all we could wish to know about a particular d - brane .    as well as being knowledgeable about d - branes",
    ", @xmath3 is also very knowledgeable about @xmath2 itself .",
    "this should nt be too surprising as if we know about all the 0-branes on @xmath2 then we know about all the points on @xmath2 and so we should know about @xmath2 itself . indeed for a very large class of algebraic varieties it was shown by bondal and orlov @xcite that @xmath2 is completely determined , as an algebraic variety , by @xmath3 .",
    "while this process does nt quite work for varieties it is easy to speculate that adding such data as the spectrum of central charges while in a ``  phase '' may provide the missing information .",
    "this would allow the target space to be constructed only given worldsheet information .",
    "clearly therefore the derived category should be of great _ physical _ as well as mathematical interest .",
    "an interesting question , also studied in @xcite , concerns in how many ways one may associate a derived category to a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "an `` autoequivalence '' of a derived category is a map from the category to itself preserving all the intrinsic algebraic structure associated to the category .",
    "such a map need not preserve d - branes themselves .",
    "for example an object representing a 2-brane may become something which more resembles a 4-brane under such a transformation . in terms of string theory",
    ", these autoequivalences can arise from monodromy in the moduli space of the complexified khler form as first observed by kontsevich @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fact that this monodromy action on @xmath3 can be understood at all is one the appealing aspects of the derived category .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the derived category should play a rle in the heterotic string for similar reasons .    since many interesting questions about @xmath3",
    "are associated to these monodromies , the purpose of this paper is to explore some of the aspects of these monodromies .",
    "the analysis of monodromies when the moduli space of complexified khler forms has only one complex dimension is pretty easy as we review in section [ s : one ] .",
    "most of the interesting properties of monodromy do not appear until we explore higher - dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "we do this in the later sections .",
    "one should note that many of these problems can be , and have been , performed using the method of solving the picard ",
    "fuchs equations and using analytic continuation ( see @xcite etc . ) .",
    "these methods have been used in the context of d - branes in such papers as @xcite .",
    "instead we will use the language of derived categories where , we believe , the structure is much simpler to understand . in this way , computation of the monodromy is extremely easy ( at least on the cohomology classes ) and does not require the aid of a computer . note that we are not being at all original in using the derived category",
    " computations along these lines have been done in @xcite for example .",
    "our work differs from the latter only in the way we probe more deeply into the moduli space addressing such questions as monodromy around landau ",
    "ginzburg points in multi - parameter examples .",
    "monodromy using the derived category approach has also been studied recently in papers such as @xcite .",
    "some interesting papers @xcite have appeared recently which compute the finite monodromy associated to orbifold theories by using the method of `` helices and mutations of exceptional sheaves '' .",
    "one of the motivations of this paper was to better understand this construction in the language of the derived category .",
    "we discuss the connection ( and differences ) in section [ s : hel ] .",
    "we also study the case of reducible exceptional divisors in section [ ss : red ] which appears , at least at first sight , to lie somewhat outside the method of helices .",
    "at least in the context of batyrev - type  varieties associated to toric geometry @xcite , it seems possible to rigorously classify all types of monodromy .",
    "indeed horja @xcite has achieved this in the neighbourhood of the large radius limit .",
    "rather than attempt such a classification we will simply go through some examples which appear to demonstrate most of the interesting things which can happen .",
    "our analysis is closely tied to the `` phase picture '' @xcite of the moduli space .",
    "one has various limit points in the moduli space each of which lies in the centre of some phase .",
    "there are naturally embedded @xmath4 s in the moduli space which connect adjacent limit points .",
    "we are concerned with monodromy within , or almost within , such @xmath4 s .",
    "most of the `` interesting '' questions one could ask about monodromy appear to be contained in this structure .    in section [ s : two ]",
    "we exhaustively study a two - parameter example obtaining all interesting monodromies associated to this model . in section [",
    "s : other ] we study some aspects of another couple of examples which exhibit some properties not seen in section [ s : two ] .",
    "because of the prominent rle played by the 0-brane in the construction of bondal and orlov , we discuss some of its properties under monodromies in section [ s : d0 ] .",
    "in this section we will quickly review the language we use for the derived category . see @xcite for more information about the derived category itself and @xcite for more on some of the notation used below .",
    "douglas @xcite has argued that the even - dimensional d - branes on a  @xmath2 should be associated with objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath2 .",
    "the morphisms in this category are associated to open strings . given a particular object @xmath5 of @xmath6 we associate projections @xmath7_{p_1}\\ar[dr]^{p_2}\\\\    x&&x } \\ ] ] and the fourier ",
    "mukai transform @xcite @xmath8 for any object @xmath9 of @xmath3 .    if @xmath5 is chosen carefully ( see @xcite for details ) then the fourier ",
    "mukai transform will be an `` autoequivalence '' of @xmath3 .",
    "namely it maps @xmath3 back to itself while preserving the important algebraic structure associated to the `` distinguished triangles '' .",
    "what this means for us is that the physics should remain invariant under such a transformation .",
    "there are two cases of such @xmath5 s which are of particular interest which will be denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "first let @xmath12 be a line bundle ( or invertible sheaf ) over @xmath2 and let @xmath13 be the diagonal embedding .",
    "then let @xmath14 ( where the superscript @xmath15 stands for `` @xmath15-field '' for reasons to become clear ) be the object of @xmath6 given by @xmath16 such that the nontrivial term is at the 0th position .",
    "now consider the object of @xmath3 given by a sheaf at 0th position : @xmath17 if we apply to ( [ eq : fsheaf ] ) the fourier ",
    "mukai transform associated to @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath18    to relate this to string theory , let @xmath19 be a sheaf supported over some subspace of @xmath2 .",
    "that is , we have a d - brane wrapping this subspace .",
    "all we have done by applying this transform is to change the field - strength of the @xmath20 gauge bundle over the d - brane .",
    "gauge invariance forces the combination @xmath21 to be appear in the action of the d - brane .",
    "the above transformation must therefore be equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "( note that we use @xmath12 to denote the line bundle , the associated divisor class and the dual 2-form @xmath23 . )",
    "thus we may assert ( as was also done in @xcite ) that _ the transformations associated to @xmath14 are those of a @xmath15-field shift @xmath22 . _    another transformation of interest is that of seidel and thomas @xcite given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the structure sheaf of @xmath2 .",
    "the superscript @xmath26 stands for `` kontsevich '' who was the first to use this kind of transformation in the context of string theory @xcite . here",
    "the notation @xmath27 is short for @xmath28 .",
    "the object @xmath29 is any object of @xmath3 which satisfies the sphericity conditions given in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a nice description of the cone construction .    now",
    "the associated fourier ",
    "mukai transform simplifies to the following @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the obvious evaluation map .",
    "it is worth pointing out a subtle but potentially important point .",
    "the cone construction is not a particularly well - defined functor in the context of the derived category .",
    "we refer to section 1.4 of chapter 5 of @xcite for a discussion of the problems . by writing the transformation in the form ( [ eq : st2 ] )",
    "we potentially expose ourselves to such ambiguities .",
    "one should always bare in mind however that the transformation exists as a fourier ",
    "mukai transform ( [ eq : fm ] ) which yields a perfectly well defined functor from @xmath3 to itself .",
    "in particular the cone appearing in ( [ eq : fmst ] ) is only defining @xmath32 as an object and no functorial properties of the cone are required there .",
    "it is difficult to understand the physical meaning of the transformation associated to @xmath32 working directly in the derived category .",
    "instead we take chern characters to see the effect on cohomology . from ( [ eq : st2 ] )",
    "one deduces that @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the tangent sheaf of @xmath2 .",
    "now it is generally believed that the ( skew - symmetric ) inner product @xmath36 on @xmath2 is equal to the ( equally skew - symmetric ) intersection form for 3-cycles on the mirror @xmath37 @xcite . according to this analogy , the transformation ( [ eq : pl ] )",
    "is nothing more than a picard  lefschetz transformation that one would associate to monodromy around a vanishing 3-sphere in @xmath37 @xcite . because of this it seems natural to expect this kind of transformation to be associated to monodromy in the moduli space of complex structures around some parts of the discriminant locus .",
    "in this section we will review a computation apparently first done by kontsevich @xcite .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath2 is the quintic hypersurface in @xmath38 . as is very well - known @xcite the moduli space of complexified khler forms can be taken to be @xmath4 with three interesting point .",
    "these point are as follows :    * the gepner point .",
    "metrically it lies at an orbifold point @xmath39 . *",
    "the `` conifold point '' .",
    "the mirror of @xmath2 acquires a conifold singularity .",
    "the conformal field theory associated to @xmath2 is singular . *",
    "the large radius limit .",
    "this point is an infinite distance away from the above two points .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the homology class of the 4-cycle given by the hyperplane section of the quintic 3-fold .",
    "we will also use @xmath1 to denote its poincar dual which generates @xmath40 .",
    "we then have @xmath41 and @xmath42    the monodromy around @xmath43 is expected to be of order 5 because of the @xmath44 quantum symmetry of the gepner model .",
    "the monodromy around @xmath45 is known to correspond to @xmath46 . in other words",
    "we expect it to be given by the transformation @xmath47 .",
    "we will denote this by @xmath48 for short .",
    "kontsevich conjectured that the monodromy around @xmath49 is given by the fourier ",
    "mukai transform @xmath50 of the previous section where @xmath29 is given by the structure sheaf @xmath25 .",
    "we denote this @xmath51 for short .",
    "we will return to this conjecture in a more precise form in section [ s : two ] .",
    "it follows from the topology of a sphere with 3 punctures that the product and @xmath45 in the `` same direction '' in order for their product to be a loop around @xmath43 . throughout this paper",
    "we will have orientation problems such as this .",
    "we will not concern ourselves at all with such details .",
    "in all the examples we do , we simply find the right combination which gives the expected results .",
    "] of the monodromy around @xmath45 and the monodromy around @xmath49 should equal the monodromy around @xmath43 and hence should be of order 5 .",
    "we may verify that this is consistent with the chern character of any starting d - brane .",
    "let us start with @xmath9 given by @xmath25 and apply the desired sequence of monodromy transformations . from ( [ eq : pl ] ) we obtain the following :",
    "@xmath52 as @xmath53 in @xmath2 .",
    "this is therefore consistent .",
    "it would be interesting to check that @xmath54 gives the identity transform when applied directly to @xmath3 rather than just applied to cohomology .",
    "we will not attempt this here .",
    "note that it is easy to apply the same method to other one parameter examples as listed in @xcite for example .",
    "the purpose of this section is to briefly point out similarities and differences between the above computation for the quintic and the notion of helices and exceptional sheaves .",
    "the reader who is not directly interested in such things can skip this section .",
    "it is easiest to describe mutations and helices directly in the derived category .",
    "see @xcite for example for more information .",
    "let us consider the space @xmath55 and let @xmath1 denote the hyperplane class . now consider the exceptional collection of sheaves @xmath56 .",
    "we may use a mutation to pull @xmath57 to the left through @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the resulting object in @xmath60 .",
    "one can compute @xmath61 .",
    "similarly we may begin with the set @xmath62 and pull @xmath63 through @xmath57 and @xmath58 to obtain @xmath64 etc .",
    "the result of such mutations appears remarkably similar to the monodromy transformations we considered in the previous section .",
    "indeed one obtains @xmath65    this correspondence fails for @xmath66 however . in this case",
    "we have @xmath67 .",
    "this disagreement should come as no surprise .",
    "the language of mutations of helices can be recast in the form of the fourier ",
    "mukai transforms of section  [ s : fmt ] .",
    "the key point however is that the algebraic variety in question is the ambient @xmath38 itself rather than the  hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "indeed exceptional sheaves can not exist on @xmath2 .",
    "a fourier  mukai transformation does _ not _ yield an autoequivalence of @xmath60 as it fails the canonical class constraint of @xcite .",
    "that is why the fifth application of the supposed monodromy transformation can kill the object in @xmath60 .",
    "the language of mutations of helices was used in @xcite successfully to obtain monodromies because equation ( [ eq : mut ] ) holds true .",
    "note however that the procedure of going from @xmath68 to @xmath69 can not generally be identified with monodromy around the gepner point because of the more general failure of this relation .",
    "the structure of monodromies becomes considerably more interesting when one starts to look at moduli spaces of more than one dimension . in this case , the `` discriminant locus '' of bad conformal field theories is a subvariety of the moduli space with dimension one or more .",
    "we wish to see if the fourier  mukai transforms considered above can also be applied in these more complicated situations .",
    "note that this problem has been studied by horja @xcite and by seidel and thomas @xcite .",
    "horja gave extensive results for monodromy loops which are `` close '' to the large radius limit in some sense .",
    "we will be interested in relations obtained by venturing further into the moduli space .",
    "the fourier ",
    "mukai transforms we will consider follow closely the construction by seidel and thomas @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite has appeared very recently which shows that these methods are essentially a special case of horja s construction .",
    "our goal in this section will be to obtain a similar result to section [ s : one ] in a two parameter example .",
    "namely , can we find a sequence of monodromies which give a loop around some point which looks like a gepner point , and hence has finite order ?    because the moduli space is two - dimensional there is no notion of `` monodromy around a point '' .",
    "given a complex curve in our moduli space we can define a monodromy .",
    "we will use two notions extensively in the text below and we wish to emphasize the difference here to avoid confusion .",
    "we will often refer to monodromy _ around _ a curve for a loop in the two - dimensional moduli space which lies external to the curve .",
    "we will also refer to to the completely different notion of monodromy _ within _ the curve around a specific point .",
    "the words `` around '' and `` within '' will always have the above meaning .",
    "our example is where @xmath2 is a blown - up hypersurface of degree 18 in the weighted projected space @xmath70 .",
    "this space was studied extensively in @xcite and analyzed in relation to d - branes in @xcite .",
    "the two generators of @xmath40 ( and their poincar dual divisors ) will be called @xmath1 and @xmath12 consistent with @xcite .",
    "if we put homogeneous coordinates @xmath71 $ ] on @xmath70 then the divisor class of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 , the class of @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "the class of @xmath76 or @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( after the blow - up ) is given by @xmath12 .",
    "this weighted projective space has a curve of singularities which intersects the hypersurface at one point .",
    "locally this point looks like the orbifold @xmath79 .",
    "we blow this up to produce an exceptional divisor @xmath80 . in terms of homology classes , @xmath81 .",
    "the remaining topological information for @xmath2 required is as follows .",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 live in @xmath85 or @xmath86 subject to the constraint @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 or @xmath89 has a single generator we denote @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "obviously any monomial of degree 4 or higher in @xmath1 or @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "finally @xmath95    the mirror , @xmath37 , of @xmath2 has defining equation @xmath96 the `` algebraic '' coordinates on the moduli space are then given by @xmath97    we may then define the discriminant as an expression in @xmath98 and @xmath99 which vanishes when @xmath37 becomes singular . if the data can be presented torically as in this case then section 3.5 of @xcite gives a nice efficient way of computing this discriminant .",
    "in our example , the discriminant factorizes into two parts : @xmath100    we want to picture the moduli space in two different ways .",
    "first we use the `` phase '' description of @xcite .",
    "see also section 3 of @xcite .",
    "we project the discriminant into @xmath101 by plotting @xmath102 against @xmath103 .",
    "we show the result in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "the result is that the 2-plane is divided into four `` phases '' .",
    "we chose our algebraic coordinates ( [ eq : algco ] ) so that the  phase appears in the positive quadrant .",
    "the limit point of this phase is the large radius limit .",
    "the positive quadrant may also be viewed as the khler cone of @xmath2 where the class @xmath1 gives the horizontal direction and @xmath12 gives the vertical direction .",
    "the other phases are pictured as follows .",
    "there is an orbifold phase whose limit point has the orbifold singularity @xmath79 but the  has infinite volume .",
    "there is a @xmath104 phase where @xmath2 collapses onto a @xmath104 .",
    "this can happen as @xmath2 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath104 . in the limit , this elliptic fibre has zero area and the @xmath104 has infinite volume .",
    "finally we have a landau  ginzburg phase with the gepner point as the limit point .",
    "the other way of drawing the moduli space is as a complex surface .",
    "the phase picture in figure  [ fig : phase ] , i.e. , the _ secondary fan _ of @xmath2 , is viewed as the fan of a toric variety @xmath105 as described in @xcite .",
    "the coordinates @xmath98 and @xmath99 are then naturally coordinates over a patch of the moduli space @xmath105.$ ] . ] in this case @xmath105 is a surface with two quotient singularities .",
    "the discriminant is a divisor in @xmath105 .",
    "we sketch @xmath105 in figure  [ fig : m ] by drawing complex dimensions as real .",
    "our limit points appear as dots in the diagram .",
    "we draw the curves @xmath106 as the @xmath4 s joining adjacent phase limits .",
    "torically these curves are associated to the lines in figure [ fig : phase ] which separate the phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : m ] also shows how the discriminant intersects these curves .",
    "note that @xmath107 and @xmath108 are themselves smooth curves in @xmath105 .",
    "the extra circles around the lg and orbifold point denote the fact that both of these points lie at a quotient singularity of the form @xmath109 in @xmath105 .    if we followed the analysis of @xcite we would now blow - up @xmath105 so that it was smooth and that the intersections of the discriminant with the curves @xmath110 were transverse .",
    "this requires several blow - ups . rather than do this ,",
    "we find it easier to work directly in @xmath105 .",
    "we would now like to take each of the curves @xmath106 in turn and do a similar computation to that of section [ s : one ] _ within _ that curve ( or nearly so ) to check our monodromy predictions .",
    "note that each curve @xmath110 has three special points on it  the two limit points and a third point where the discriminant hits the curve in some way .",
    "thus , just as in section [ s : one ] , we will show that the product of the monodromy around one of the limit points and around the discriminant is equal to the monodromy around the other limit point .",
    "let us fix a basepoint near the large  limit point . because we have identified the cone of this phase with the khler cone of @xmath2 we immediately know the monodromies around @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "each must be a shift in the @xmath15-field . to be precise",
    ", a loop around @xmath111 will correspond to @xmath22 and hence corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "similarly a loop around @xmath112 is given by @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath111 and @xmath112 intersect transversely , the monodromy around the  point within @xmath111 corresponds to going around @xmath112 and is thus given by @xmath48 .",
    "in other words @xmath113 .    what about the monodromy within @xmath111 around the point in the middle where the discriminant hits ?",
    "a method for computing this was presented in @xcite but we will proceed a little differently . first we need to decide how to go around a generic part of @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath107 is the irreducible component of the discriminant corresponding to the appearance of singularities in ( [ eq : def1 ] ) for _ nonzero _ @xmath114 .",
    "this was dubbed the `` @xmath115-discriminant '' in @xcite .- determinant '' for the full discriminant @xmath116 .",
    "even more confusingly , @xmath107 has sometimes been called the `` principal component '' of the discriminant @xcite . ]",
    "we will call it the `` _ primary _ '' component of the discriminant .",
    "one could also define this as the component which is computed by finding solutions to equation ( 3.45 ) of @xcite .",
    "we then state the following conjecture which appears to be due to horja , kontsevich and morrison in some form or another @xcite .    for a suitable choice of basepoint near the  limit point ,",
    "a loop around the primary component of the discriminant is given by @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "[ conj : k ]    this is certainly consistent with section [ s : one ] where the primary component was the entire discriminant .",
    "assuming this conjecture to be true we still have a complication that makes the computation a little less straight - forward .",
    "namely , @xmath111 does not intersect @xmath107 transversely but rather intersects it tangentially with multiplicity 3 .",
    "this means that we can not say that the monodromy within @xmath111 around the discriminant is given by the above conjecture .    to proceed with the computation we can put a small 3-sphere @xmath119 around the intersection of @xmath107 and @xmath111 .",
    "since @xmath107 and @xmath111 are both smooth it follows that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are both unknotted circles .",
    "because of the tangential intersection , these circles are linked three times .",
    "we may remove a point of @xmath119 and imagine the link in @xmath122 .",
    "we show this in figure  [ fig:3link ] .",
    "next we need to describe @xmath123 .",
    "to do this we use the wirtinger presentation ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "imagine fixing a basepoint above the sheet of paper .",
    "the arrow @xmath124 in figure  [ fig:3link ] then represents the element of @xmath125 looping under the left circle in the direction indicated by the arrow .",
    "similarly we define @xmath126 for the right circle .",
    "we then have further elements @xmath127 as shown in the figure .",
    "crossing relations then determine represents the path @xmath126 followed by the path @xmath124 . ]",
    "@xmath128 but clearly @xmath129 which yields the relation @xmath130 indeed @xmath123 is given by the group on two generators @xmath131 subject to the single relation ( [ eq : pi1rel ] ) .",
    "deform the path within @xmath111 around the discriminant point a little so that it lies outside @xmath111 .",
    "this is the path around which we wish to compute the monodromy .",
    "this is the ( clockwise ) path which follows closely the circle @xmath132 .",
    "such a path is homotopic to @xmath133 .",

    "the monodromy around @xmath167 is trivial .",
    "_ we also see that our natural deformation of the loop within @xmath112 is the correct one .",

    "this has the effect of sending that component of the khler form of to infinity .",

    "consider first the loop around the orbifold point within @xmath167 . in order to understand the monodromy we need again to deform this loop a little as in section  [ ss : c2 ] .",
    "it turns out that the simplest deformation of this loop is homotopic to the same class @xmath178 as above .",
    "figure  [ fig : m ] certainly makes this statement counterintuitive ! at first sight it looks like a loop within @xmath112 is like a loop around @xmath167 and a loop within @xmath167 looks like a loop around @xmath112 and these are certainly not equal .",
    "it is the quotient singularity which stops this argument working .",
    "both the loop within @xmath112 and the loop within @xmath167 must deform to elements of @xmath172 which map to the same element of @xmath162 in ( [ eq : ext3 ] ) .",

    "therefore monodromy around the orbifold point within @xmath167 is given by @xmath182 .",
    "the loop around the discriminant point within @xmath167 is easy .",
    "since @xmath107 intersects @xmath167 transversely , the monodromy is given by @xmath183 .",
    "the monodromy around the lg point is then given by @xmath184    what properties should we expect for @xmath185 ?",
    "the geometry around the lg point is very similar ( up to orientation questions ) to the geometry around the orbifold point .",
    "in particular one may show that the loop corresponding to @xmath185 is such that its third power is homotopic to a loop around @xmath167 and @xmath186 .",
    "now we know that a loop around @xmath167 induces no monodromy from section [ ss : c2 ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath186 intersects @xmath111 transversely at a smooth point in @xmath105 tells us that the loop around @xmath186 is given by @xmath135 from section [ ss : c1 ] . thus @xmath187 should have the same properties as @xmath135 .",
    "we saw in section [ ss : c1 ] that @xmath135 was of order 6 . _",
    "it follows that @xmath185 is of order 18 .",
    "_    we may confirm this explicitly .",
    "e.g. : @xmath188 comparing closely ( [ eq : q1 t ] ) and ( [ eq : q3 t ] ) we see that @xmath187 is not quite the same thing as @xmath135 although their effect is very similar .",
    "as we have described the loops corresponding to these transformations , they actually differ by a change in basepoint and so @xmath135 and @xmath187 are only equivalent up to conjugation .",
    "the sequence of transformations given in ( [ eq : q3 t ] ) is identical to the sequence predicted by @xcite in the language of helices and mutations .",
    "there one begins with a sequence of exceptional sheaves on @xmath189 of the form @xmath190 .",
    "one then mutates all the bundles to the left to reverse their order giving a sequence of objects whose chern characters are exactly given by ( [ eq : q3 t ] ) .",
    "it is not hard to see why this is so . roughly speaking the transformation",
    "@xmath191 may be described as follows .",
    "@xmath14 takes the sheaf @xmath192 to @xmath193 .",
    "next @xmath158 leaves @xmath194 or @xmath195 invariant but takes @xmath196 to @xmath197 .",
    "finally @xmath198 is a `` left mutation '' just as it was for the quintic in section [ s : hel ] .",
    "this gives a natural explanation for the funny `` jump '' seen in the required sequence of exceptional sheaves from @xmath195 to @xmath199 .",
    "it is effectively caused by the action of @xmath158 .",
    "note again the following shortcoming of the method of using sheaves on @xmath189 .",
    "if we extend this process by adding @xmath200 to the above sequence of sheaves then the 18th transformation of @xmath58 would have chern character equal to 0 rather than 1 .",
    "again this is because the corresponding fourier ",
    "mukai transform on @xmath189 is not invertible .",
    "finally we do the monodromy computation within @xmath186 .",
    "this actually yields nothing new .",
    "let @xmath201 be the monodromy given by the loop within @xmath186 around the lg point . because the lg point is an orbifold point",
    ", one can show that this loop ( or at least a small deformation of it ) is the same as the loop within @xmath167 around the lg point for reasons essentially identical to the discussion in section [ ss : c2 ] .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath202 .",
    "indeed monodromy around the @xmath104 point within @xmath186 is given by @xmath14 ; and monodromy around the discriminant point requires loops around both @xmath108 and @xmath107 as seen in figure [ fig : m ] .",
    "thus we see @xmath203 consistent with the above paragraph .",
    "consider trying to generalize the results of this example .",
    "one can show that the specific structure of the monodromy seen in this example depends mainly on the fact that @xmath2 is a fibration .",
    "for example we could consider a more complicated example with 3 khler moduli such as the resolved hypersurface of degree 24 in @xmath204 .",
    "this is an elliptic fibration over a hirzebruch surface which itself is a @xmath4-fibration over @xmath4 . in this example one",
    "has a curve in the moduli space which is the analogue of @xmath186 above .",
    "it connects the landau ",
    "ginzburg phase with the @xmath4 phase .",
    "monodromy around the lg point can then be shown to be of a form @xmath205 .",
    "this will then reproduce the results of section 9.3 of @xcite for example .",
    "note however that the fibration structure is essential here .",
    "the example of section [ s : two ] demonstrated many features of monodromy but there are many other important possibilities which did not appear . in this section",
    "we discuss some examples which do exhibit these effects .",
    "all the monodromies around components of the discriminant have been given by a fourier ",
    "mukai transform of the form ( [ eq : fmst ] ) studied by seidel and thomas .",
    "here we discuss an example that falls outside this class .",
    "let us consider the resolved hypersurface @xmath2 of degree 8 in @xmath206 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for extensive details of this model .",
    "the space @xmath2 can be thought of as a k3-fibration over @xmath207 or as the resolution of a singular space with a curve of singularities of the form @xmath208 .",
    "this model has the same moduli space as that of section [ s : two ] except for the following aspects :    * the @xmath104 phase is renamed a @xmath4 phase as this is the base of the fibration .",
    "* the lg and orbifold limit points are now at orbifold points locally of the form @xmath208 . *",
    "the @xmath107 component of the discriminant now intersects @xmath111 at a point of multiplicity two rather than three .",
    "when we compute the monodromies around the discriminant the real difference appears when we consider @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath141 be the exceptional divisor in @xmath2 coming from the resolution of the curve of singularities .",
    "@xmath141 is a product of a genus 3 curve @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "we associate @xmath108 with the collapse of @xmath141 down to @xmath209 .",
    "the discussion in section [ ss : c2 ] concerned an exceptional divisor contracting to a _ point _ and so can not be applied to monodromy around @xmath108 .",
    "the computation of the monodromy on chern characters was computed in @xcite .",
    "the result may be rephrased as follows . for a divisor",
    "@xmath141 collapsing to a curve @xmath209 of genus @xmath211 , monodromy around @xmath108 is given by @xmath212 where @xmath210 is the inverse image of a point for the blow - down .",
    "the fourier ",
    "mukai transform given by ( [ eq : fmst ] ) is incompatible with ( [ eq : etoz ] ) .",
    "a more general form which is consistent is given by horja in @xcite . ) .",
    "] we refer to these references for more details .    given the form of the monodromy ( [ eq : etoz ] ) it is easy to reproduce all the corresponding results of section [ s : two ] for this example .",
    "one might have got the impression from the localization argument in section [ ss : c2 ] that we can understand the monodromy associated to an orbifold singularity by studying the little  @xmath145 living inside the exceptional divisor @xmath141 . indeed",
    "this argument shows that the analysis we did in section [ s : two ] for a  threefold would also apply locally to a  fivefold which has a @xmath213 orbifold singularity given by the action @xmath214 where @xmath215 .",
    "this is because the resolved @xmath189 is the exceptional divisor for this five - dimensional orbifold .",
    "while this is useful in some circumstances it does not mean that any orbifold analysis can be reduced to a  computation in lower dimensions .",
    "the problem is that the exceptional divisor for an orbifold singularity may be _",
    "reducible_. indeed one generically expects an exceptional divisor be to reducible . in this case",
    "the notion of the  `` inside '' the exceptional divisor makes no sense .    at least in the context of toric cases",
    "we can make some general statements about the difference between a reducible and irreducible exceptional divisor .",
    "the impression one might have been left with from the above examples is that each particular exceptional divisor @xmath141 is associated with its own component @xmath216 of the discriminant divisor . in this case one then associates monodromy around @xmath216 with a process involving the collapse of @xmath141 .    in the batyrev @xcite way of describing  @xmath217-folds , one has a set of points , @xmath218 , lying in a hyperplane in @xmath219 .",
    "vectors from the origin to these points generate the one - dimensional edges of a fan . by the usual algorithm in toric geometry",
    "this fan gives the canonical line bundle over some @xmath220-dimensional variety @xmath221 .",
    "@xmath2 is then the `` little '' living inside @xmath221 .",
    "let @xmath222 by the convex hull of @xmath218 .",
    "one can show ( see chapter 10 of @xcite ) that the irreducible components of the discriminant are determined by faces of @xmath222 of various dimensions . for a nontrivial component we require at least @xmath223 points in a @xmath224-dimensional face .",
    "if each face of @xmath222 has at most one point in its interior then each divisor associated to this interior point gets its own component of the discriminant .",
    "this was the case for the examples studied above and was the case for all the examples studied in @xcite .",
    "it is precisely when we have a reducible exceptional divisor that this fails .",
    "we will consider an example of this .",
    "for a change we will use a k3 surface rather than a  threefold .",
    "the results generalize easily to the threefold case .",

    "each @xmath226 singularity is resolved by a single @xmath4 and each @xmath162 singularity is resolved by a sum of two @xmath4 s intersecting at a point .",
    "the fact that the k3 is embedded in the given ambient space ties the blow - ups of the points of similar type together .",
    "there are in fact only four khler degrees of freedom  the overall size of the initial weighted projective space , one blow - up of all the @xmath226 fixed points and two blow - ups for all the @xmath162 fixed points .",
    "@xmath227    we list the coordinates of the points @xmath218 in table  [ tab : k3 ] .",
    "we also show the divisor classes in terms of a basis @xmath228 associated to these vectors .",

    "we will only concern ourselves with monodromies associated to the @xmath162 blow - ups . to do this",
    "we only consider variations in the @xmath115 and @xmath15 components of the khler form .",

    "these each intersect @xmath2 in four copies of @xmath4 .",
    "each @xmath4 from one set intersects one member from the other set of @xmath4 s in one point .",
    "together these form the resolutions of the four @xmath162 fixed points .",
    "note that the set @xmath234 lies on a straight line .",
    "let us fix algebraic coordinates @xmath235 in terms of these , the component of the discriminant associated with the line @xmath234 is @xmath236 there are two other components of the discriminant  the primary component and one associated to the three @xmath226 fixed points .",

    "we will call the latter two phases @xmath238 and @xmath239 since they are associated to blowing down using the @xmath115 or @xmath15 component of the khler form respectively .",
    "note again that there is only a _",
    "irreducible component , @xmath108 , of the divisor associated to this picture .",
    "the same component of the discriminant is responsible for blowing down either of the @xmath4 s .",
    "now , of course , the moduli space is really four dimensional .",
    "we want to think of figure  [ fig : z3 ] as representing a slice of the moduli space , where the @xmath1 and @xmath240 components of the khler form have been taken to infinity .",

    "one can show that applying @xmath248 twice induces multiplication by @xmath249 on the chern characters .",
    "this should be viewed in the same way as section [ ss : c2 ] .    what about the curve @xmath250 which connects the large radius limit to the @xmath239 limit point ? in this case",
    "the discriminant point induces monodromy given by @xmath251 which induces @xmath252 one can then show that applying @xmath253 twice induces multiplication by @xmath254 on the chern characters .",
    "this is all very well except that @xmath245 and @xmath251 are both monodromies around the _ same _ component of the discriminant .",
    "the reason they are different is that if we fix a base point near the large radius limit then the loop around @xmath108 inside @xmath243 is not homotopic to the loop around @xmath108 inside @xmath250 .",

    "this allows for the difference between @xmath245 and @xmath251 .",
    "note that this is the very same cusp as the one studied by argyres and douglas @xcite .",
    "finally let us see how to compute the effect of monodromy going three times around the @xmath162 limit point .",
    "let @xmath256 be the curve connecting the @xmath238 limit point to the @xmath162 limit point .",
    "the monodromy within @xmath256 around the @xmath238 limit point is identical to the monodromy within @xmath257 around the @xmath238 limit point for the reasons given in section [ ss : c3 ] .",

    "_    we may check that this cubes to something nice .",
    "indeed the effect on the chern characters implies that @xmath259 one can show that this is consistent with the global geometry of the moduli space and so our monodromies all have the expected properties .",
    "we have given various rules for how to compute the effect of monodromy on the chern character of a d - brane .",
    "in this last section we will discuss the consequences for a 0-brane .",
    "the 0-brane is of particular interest as it is the basic object used in the construction of bondal and orlov @xcite to build the target space from the derived category .",
    "the fact that the 0-brane can transform into something else under monodromy is one reason why the bondal and orlov construction is ambiguous for a  space .",
    "note again that the following results could have been guessed using the picard ",
    "fuchs differential equations . in that language",
    "the 0-brane often appears as a constant solution to the differential equations @xcite .",
    "the derived category provides a much simpler picture however .    for a  threefold @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath260 be an object in @xmath3 which corresponds to a 0-brane .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is poincar dual to a point . under monodromy",
    "about @xmath107 we have @xmath263 that is , the 0-brane always picks up a 6-brane charge upon an orbit around @xmath107 .",
    "now consider the other monodromies in this paper .",
    "they all involve taking the structure sheaf @xmath155 of some collapsing cycle @xmath141 and computing @xmath264 .",
    "if @xmath141 is of dimension less than 6 then this inner product is always zero .",
    "thus the 0-brane undergoes no monodromy about these kinds of components in the discriminant .",
    "we therefore make the following    the 0-brane undergoes monodromy if and only if we circle the primary component , @xmath107 , of the discriminant .",
    "if we begin in a large radius smooth  phase , which other phases may we visit without crossing a wall in the phase diagram which contains @xmath107 ?",
    "in other words , over what area of the phase diagram can we fix a choice of 0-brane without worrying about monodromy ?",
    "the answer consists of the so - called `` geometric phases '' or `` partially enlarged khler moduli space '' of @xcite .",
    "the phases correspond to triangulations of batyrev s reflexive polytope @xcite .",
    "the statement that a phase is geometric corresponds to every simplex in the triangulation having the unique point in the interior of the polytope as a vertex .    comparing to the example in section [ s : two ] for example",
    ", the geometric phases consist of the  phase and the orbifold phase where we have a three complex dimensional picture of the target space .",
    "indeed , these phases are separated only by @xmath108 around which the 0-brane has no monodromy .",
    "the geometric phases consist of those reached from the  phase only by blowing down subspaces .",
    "if one reduces the overall dimension of the target space then one must cross a wall containing @xmath107 .",
    "there are also exotic `` exoflop '' transitions @xcite where part of the target space remains three - dimensional but a lower - dimensional part grows out of the side of the target space .",
    "these exoflops also involve crossing a @xmath107 boundary and are not considered geometric .    proving the statement about these phases is an application of the combinatorics discussed in chapter 11 of @xcite .",
    "there is an object @xmath265 which is a function on the cones of the secondary fan .",
    "if @xmath265 changes as you pass to a neighbouring cone then the wall contained @xmath107 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath265 changes as you pass from a geometric phase to a non - geometric phase .",
    "this result is essentially contained in corollary 4.5 of chapter 11 of @xcite .",
    "it is a more tedious exercise to show that passing between geometric phases of threefolds keeps @xmath265 constant .",
    "this result appears to jibe nicely with the bondal and orlov construction .",
    "we may consistently tie the derived category to a target space interpretation so long as we confine ourselves to geometric phases .",
    "once we leave these phases then the 0-brane undergoes monodromy and we acquire an ambiguity in the way we construct the target space .",
    "finally we should note that there can still be an ambiguity in what exactly is called a 0-brane in the geometric phases .",
    "if there are two or more smooth phases related by flops then each phase has its own 0-branes . the exact way these branes",
    "are related to each other was given by bridgeland @xcite .",
