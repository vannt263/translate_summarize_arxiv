    "russell theorem break down in the pre - ms , where substantial star - to - star variations in luminosity are ubiquitous at fixed  in star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this behaviour has traditionally been interpreted as the signature of an intracluster age spread , but an alternative explanation is that stars at fixed mass and age can have non - uniform stellar parameters ( i.e. radius ) induced by processes neglected in traditional models , such as rotation , mass accretion , and magnetic fields .",
    "much attention has been paid to understanding these processes , as a complete picture of pre - ms evolution is crucial for inferring the ages of young star - forming regions , measuring the low end of the stellar initial mass function , and constraining the distribution of circumstellar disc lifetimes , which in turn have important implications for both the angular momentum evolution of stars and the formation of planets .",
    "the light element @xmath2li is a sensitive diagnostic of pre - ms structure .",
    "lithium burns through the @xmath2li@xmath3 reaction at a temperature @xmath4  k , and is therefore directly destroyed in stellar envelopes when the temperature at the base of the surface convection zone ( @xmath5 ) is high . during the period of deep convection on the pre - ms , @xmath5 surpasses @xmath6 for fgk stars , inducing li depletion in the envelope @xcite .",
    "this ` standard model ' depletion terminates during the approach to the zero - age ms ( zams ) , when the convection zone retreats and again becomes cool .",
    "because the rate of li burning scales as @xmath7 near the destruction temperature @xcite , the magnitude of standard model depletion is extremely sensitive to @xmath5 . in standard stellar models ( ssms ) , only mass and composition influence this temperature ,",
    "so equal mass stars within clusters are expected to reach the zams with equal surface li abundances , and remain nearly fixed in a(li)(@xmath8(li)/@xmath8(h ) ) ] until the ms turn - off .    by contrast , li abundance spreads have been observed in many stellar populations , such as the late g and k dwarfs on the pre - ms and zams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* sp14 hereafter , and references therein ) , the mid - f dwarfs of 0.10.5 gyr old clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and solar analogues of old clusters and the field ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "various non - standard processes have been put forward to explain the development of these dispersions , but they are generally unable to simultaneously explain all three above classes .",
    "for example , rotational mixing can induce depletion and dispersion on the ms , but can not replicate the pattern in young stars ( see below ) . explaining this multifaceted li depletion pattern presents a serious challenge for stellar evolution theory , but",
    "its resolution must reveal interesting physics not included in the standard model .    in this work , we investigate a potential cause of the li dispersion developing on the pre - ms .",
    "this dispersion has been identified in several young clusters , such as blanco 1 and @xmath9 per @xcite , but we focus solely on the most notable example , the pleiades .",
    "the pleiades is a nearby open cluster ( d @xmath10 133  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , just beyond the k dwarf zams ( @xmath11  myr old ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with a near - solar iron abundance ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 0.03 @xmath12 0.02 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pleiades also exhibits a significant ,  dependent spread in the @xmath136708 li i absorption feature , originally identified by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "this ew dispersion suggests an abundance spread at fixed  of a few tenths of a dex at 6000k , which increases to greater than an order of magnitude below 5500k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lirot ] ) .",
    "this dispersion has remained unexplained since its discovery , but an intriguing clue has motivated several attempts at resolution : the most li rich stars at fixed  tend to be the most rapidly rotating in the k dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "this observation has led several authors to suggest that the dispersion results from various observational biases related to rapid rotation , such as the enhancement of the @xmath136708 li i feature due to blending from rotational broadening @xcite , large spot filling factors and chromospheric activity altering observed equivalent widths @xcite , and non - lte effects @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that while these effects may contribute to the total dispersion , some underlying li spread is likely present ( see the discussion in @xmath146.2 of ) .",

    "rotational mixing has been invoked to explain the progressive destruction of li observed in ms open clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it also naturally predicts the development of li dispersions , found in some ( but not all ) old clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since depletion rates are determined by the non - uniform angular momentum ( am ) histories of individual stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , rotational mixing decreases in efficiency at late ages due to stellar spin down , permitting the observed plateauing of li abundances seen for old clusters @xcite .",
    "while rotational mixing may be responsible for ms depletion , it is unlikely to produce the pattern seen in the pleiades k dwarfs .",
    "li depletion through rotational mixing is most efficient in rapid rotators , opposite to the sense of the li ",
    "rotation correlation in the pleiades .",
    "this implies that some stronger process related to rotation on the pre - ms must counteract the depletion of li through mixing .",
    "several such mechanisms have been suggested in the literature , such as stronger internal shears in slow rotators due to disparate core ",

    "li spread : a dispersion in stellar radii at fixed mass and age during the pre - ms .",
    "if the convective envelope of a star were inflated relative to standard predictions , the temperature at the base of the convection zone would be reduced .",
    "li destruction in the envelope is a strong function of this temperature , so stars of dissimilar radii would undergo different rates of li depletion during the pre - ms , and thus arrive at the zams with unequal li abundances .",
    "this effect is so strong that a pre - ms radius spread of @xmath1010 per cent in non - rotating models produces a greater than order - of - magnitude spread in li at the zams , and if the most inflated stars were also the most rapidly rotating , the observed li ",
    "rotation correlation would be naturally produced .",
    "this idea was motivated by the rapidly - growing literature on discrepancies between the precisely measured radii of stars and the predictions of modern stellar evolution codes .",
    "accurate radius measurements ( @xmath1013 per cent ) can be obtained by analysing the light curves of detached eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by measuring the angular diameter of nearby stars with interferometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the average radii of open clusters can also be inferred by statistically modelling projected radius measurements ( @xmath15 sin @xmath16 ; @xcite ) . with each method ,",
    "discrepancies between predicted and observed radii of @xmath1010 per cent have been found .",
    "these so - called ` radius anomalies ' have been identified , and found to correlate with rotation , in the pre - ms cluster ic 348 @xcite .",
    "they have also been claimed in young ms clusters , including the pleiades @xcite , and the magnitude of the discrepancy has been seen to correlate with chromospheric activity and rotation rate @xcite .    in",
    ", we showed that a @xmath1010 per cent radius dispersion on the pre - ms can produce a li dispersion commensurate with the pleiades pattern .",
    "however , the impact of rotational mixing was not included .",
    "mixing - driven li destruction is strongest in rapid rotators , so this effect could compete with the inflationary inhibition of li destruction .",
    "we therefore seek to assess whether a connection between rotation and radius inflation during the pre - ms represents a viable class of solutions to the pleiades li problem . to address this question",
    ", we simultaneously calculate the effects of rotational mixing and radius inflation on li depletion in our evolutionary models , and compare the results to the empirical pleiades distribution . to model radius inflation , we apply a modification to the mixing length in our stellar evolution code ( @xmath14[sec : calib ] ) .",
    "this approach provides us with a generic framework within which to explore the impact of radius on li destruction .",
    "we construct a grid of models with dimensions of mass , radius inflation , and rotation using this method ( @xmath14[sec : amevol ] ) , and collect a catalog of pleiades data , for comparison with our models ( @xmath14[sec : data ] ) .    with this model grid , we explore the individual and simultaneous impacts of rotation and radius inflation on li abundances ( @xmath14[sec : section3 ] ) , and conclude that large inflation factors can indeed suppress rotationally - driven li destruction in stellar models . based on this result , we explore whether a putative connection between the two properties can produce a pattern which resembles the empirical pleiades distribution ( @xmath14[sec : section4 ] ) .",
    "several limiting cases are ruled out , and a special case where faster rotation leads to greater radius inflation is found to compare favourably with the pleiades .",
    "thus , we conclude that the important qualitative features of the pleiades li and rotation pattern can be predicted in stellar models _ if and only if _",

    "the final solar calibrated values are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and  @xmath22 .",

    "we treat electron screening using the method of @xcite , and do not include diffusion , as the timescales of this process are very long compared to the ages of systems we are concerned with .",
    "our models are initialised with a li abundance equal to the proto - solar abundance a(li ) = 3.31 @xcite .",
    "we model radius inflation in this paper by reducing the mixing length parameter , as suggested by @xcite . while inhibited convection can result directly from the presence of magnetic fields in the convective envelope of stars",
    ", we do not ascribe a specific underlying cause to the radius inflation considered in this paper . due to the adiabatic nature of convective regions ,",
    "a given fractional increase in the radius will have a similar effect on the temperature at the base of the envelope regardless of the underlying cause .",
    "we can therefore use an altered mixing length to explore the generic effects on li abundances of any mechanism which increases the radii of stars .",
    "the mixing length is held fixed for each individual model during its lifetime , and is determined by requiring a specified inflation percentage at 10 myr , an age characteristic of pre - ms li destruction .",

    "the resulting pattern is more complicated : li depletion can either increase or decrease compared to a standard benchmark ( no inflation , no rotation ) depending on the relative strength of the two effects .",
    "in particular , we find that if a connection between rotation and inflation is present , li abundance tends to correlate with rotation in cool stars .",

    "rotational mixing , meridional circulation and internal shears transport material between layers , leading to a gradual dilution of the convective envelope with li - depleted material from the deep interior .",
    "stars are born with a range of initial rotation conditions , so the rate of mixing differs from star to star in young systems , leading to the emergence of li dispersions . both the convective envelope and the radiative interior spin down over the course of 0.55 gyr , eventually losing memory of their initial conditions , and asymptoting to rotation profile that depends on age but not early rotation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this process equalises the rate of late - time li depletion between stars with different am histories , thus freezing out the intra - cluster li dispersion . throughout stellar lifetimes ,",
    "the strength of mixing depends both on the absolute rotation rate of the star and on the degree of differential rotation within the star ; this makes li depletion efficient at young ages and inefficient at old ages , given the progressive spin - down of stars .",
    "this generic picture of ms rotational mixing has been long established , but we are concerned in this work with the effect of rotation on the pre - ms , which is often neglected in mixing studies due to its small assumed effect relative to standard model depletion .",

    "shorter disc - locking times lead to faster rotation at the zams , given an equal initial rotation rate .",
    "thus the observational result that disc lifetimes differ from star to star naturally implies a @xmath271  dex range of rotation periods at the zams .",
    "the bottom left panel follows the evolution of li in the envelope of each model .",

    "the second pre - ms phase represents the time when the temperature at the base of the convection zone surpasses the li depletion temperature ( see @xmath14[sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the rate of li destruction during this phase is a strong function of rotation , so depletion in rapid rotators is high .",
    "this is because rotational mixing is particularly efficient when the material directly below the convection zone is highly depleted , as is the case when convection zones are deep .",
    "we have also plotted the li track of a standard , non - rotating model ( black dashed line ) for comparison .",
    "this model depletes nearly the same amount of li during the pre - ms as the slow rotating models (  @xmath37 1 myr ) , suggesting that very rapid rotation ( @xmath38 1 day period ) is necessary for an appreciable enhancement to the rate of pre - ms depletion .        the right column of fig .",

    "a large range of rotation rates persist at 125 myr within our mass range .",
    "the rotation dispersion is largest below @xmath10 5700k , and decreases towards larger .",
    "we also see that the structural effects of rapid rotation lead to a reduction of the surface temperature by @xmath10 50150k , independent of spot - induced changes .",
    "this results from the additional pressure support provided by rotation at the equator , which leads to a lower effective gravity , and hence a larger equilibrium radius .",
    "the bottom right panel shows li isochrones at the age of the pleiades .",
    "lower mass stars undergo deeper convection during the pre - ms , and spend more time on the pre - ms , resulting in more rapid li destruction over an extended period of time , and ultimately a lower abundance at 125 myr .",
    "variable rotation induces a li dispersion commensurate with the 0.9  spread at all masses in the considered range , suggesting that the 0.9  li tracks are representative of the behaviour of li destruction in all of our models .",
    "thus , our rotating models predict that at the age of the pleiades , slow rotators should cluster near the standard prediction ( dashed black line ) , and fast rotators should be depleted below the standard prediction by @xmath101.5 dex .",
    "these results are necessarily dependent on the details of the stellar models , notably the treatment of angular momentum transport and loss .",
    "while we have assumed that angular momentum is redistributed purely by hydrodynamics and mechanics ( @xmath14[sec : intro ] ) , some authors have argued that empirical rotation trends are better fit by models which include additional transport processes operating in the interior ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which could have implications for pre - ms li destruction .",

    "we expand upon this idea by generating synthetic cluster distributions with a variety of inflation / rotation prescriptions , initialised to reproduce the pleiades rotation distribution , and comparing them directly to the data .    to construct these synthetic distributions ,",
    "we first adopt a rule that explicitly links the degree of inflation to the rotation period at a benchmark age of 10 myr [  = ( ) ] . using this rule , we collapse our 3-dimensional model grid ( mass , , inflation ) into two dimensions ( mass , ) by interpolating between models of fixed @xmath23 and , but variable , to the location in parameter space where the inflation rule  = ( ) is satisfied .",
    "the result is a specific mapping between each choice of @xmath23 and  ( corresponding to a specific  at 10 myr ) , and the relevant observables , , a(li ) , and , at 125 myr .",
    "next , we derive initial conditions by backwards modeling the empirical pleiades pattern . for each pleiad shown in fig . [",

    "we then calculate the li abundance at 125 myr for the derived @xmath23 and  of each pleiad , given the above rotation / inflation relationship .",
    "this method is advantageous : since the synthetic cluster matches the temperature and rotation distribution of the present day pleiades by construction , a comparison between the li / rotation pattern of the synthetic cluster and the empirical pattern is unbiased by the sampling of the initial conditions .",
    "finally , we randomly generate  and a(li ) errors from gaussians with @xmath39 = 100k and 0.1 dex , respectively , and apply them to the models to simulate noise .",
    "using this methodology , we generate two limiting cases which represent distinct classes of physical models : no radius anomaly in any stars , regardless of rotation ( i ) ; constant radius anomaly of 10 per cent in all stars , regardless of rotation ( ii ) .",
    "we further test a third limiting case , with radius anomalies in the range 010 per cent , uncorrelated with rotation ( iii ) .",
    "the methodology of case iii differs somewhat from cases i and ii , since no direct mapping exists between rotation and inflation in the uncorrelated scenario ( see @xmath14[sec : case3 ] ) . with the synthetic distributions in hand , we search for three features of the empirical pleiades pattern : the median abundance as a function of , the width of the li distribution as a function of , and a positive correlation between li abundance and rotation rate .",
    "in each case , the resulting distribution is found to be at odds with the empirical pleiades pattern .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that a power law relationship between  and  above a critical rotation period produces a qualitatively accurate synthetic distribution , and show that the agreement is insensitive to the details of the assumed mapping .",
    "we caution that the mass dependence , the normalisation , and indeed even the existence , of the correlation between rotation and inflation are at present unresolved ( see @xmath14[sec : mechanism ] ) .",
    "we therefore present this section as an exploratory exercise , and do not attempt a rigorous quantitative analysis .",

    "the models bracket the lower envelope of the pleiades distribution , but do not approach the upper envelope .",
    "the synthetic distribution for this case , generated as described above , appears in the bottom left panel of this figure .",
    "as can be seen , the resulting li pattern is inconsistent with empirical cluster distribution .",
    "the median abundance falls below the empirical median , the distribution width fails to increase substantially towards lower , and while the slowly rotating models approximately correspond to the locus of slow rotators in the pleiades , the rapid rotators are too strongly depleted in li to reproduce the observed pattern . as none of the aforementioned empirical features",
    "is reproduced by this limiting case , we strongly rule out the possibility that the observed li pattern results purely from rotationally - induced mixing .",
    "the second limiting case assumes a ` saturated ' inflation law ; all stars possess the same radius anomaly regardless of rotation rate  hence ( ) @xmath40 0.1 .",
    "this scenario is consistent with @xcite , who found that the _ average _ k dwarf radius in the pleiades is @xmath1010 per cent larger than expected from isochrones calibrated on old , inactive stars .",
    "furthermore , uniform  on the pre - ms is supported by @xcite and @xcite , who found that nearly all stars in the pre - ms associations onc and h per are saturated , and might therefore have the same radius anomaly if magnetic field proxies correlate directly with radius inflation .",
    "the upper middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : limitingcases ] shows the mapping for this scenario .",
    "the slowest rotating models tend to lie above and to the right of their counterparts in case i , as inflation suppresses li destruction and reduces the surface temperature . for the rapidly rotating stars ,",
    "the decrease in  is far more extreme , causing a strong shift to the right .",
    "the result is a substantial overlap of the mass tracks .",
    "this is not seen in the most massive tracks , since even the fastest rotators in these bins have spun down substantially by 125 myr ( see fig .",

    "the lower middle panel shows the resulting synthetic distribution . as in case i",
    ", the models occupy a band at fixed  that is far narrower than the empirical spread . unlike case i",
    ", the median abundance trend lies far above the empirical median , and traces the upper envelope of the pleiades distribution .",
    "this signifies that a uniform suppression of depletion is too strong to reproduce the most li - poor stars below @xmath10 5500k .",
    "the location of the rapid rotating models approximately corresponds with the rapid rotators in the pleiades , but they remain more depleted than slowly rotating models . once again , the qualitative features of the pleiades pattern are not in general reproduced , ruling out uniform inflation from the epoch of pre - ms li destruction to the present .",
    "we note however that case i and case ii suggestively bracket the observed data range .",
    "the final limiting case assumes that no direct correlation exists between rotation and inflation . as stated above , a direct mapping such as those constructed for cases i and ii",
    "can not be defined for case iii , as rotation and inflation are by definition uncorrelated .",
    "instead , we adopt the initial distribution of @xmath23 and  derived from the pleiades for case i , randomly draw an inflation factor between 010 per cent for each individual star , and interpolate in the model grid to find the 125 myr distribution . a physical scenario which may correspond to this limiting case",

    "the resulting synthetic distribution is presented in the bottom right of fig . [",

    "in particular , it increases from @xmath100.5 dex at the solar temperature to @xmath1011.5 dex below 5000k , in good agreement with the pleiades .",
    "the median of the pattern appears to track the empirical median as well .",
    "however , the rotation distribution does not correspond to the observed pattern .",
    "since rotation and inflation are uncorrelated , we see far too many slow rotators at the top of the distribution , and far too many rapid rotators at the bottom . for example , cool - ward of 5000k , 21 out of the 32 stars with rotation periods greater than 2 days have a(li ) @xmath27 2 in our synthetic distribution ( 65 per cent ) , compared to only 1 out of 15 in the empirical distribution . the probability of finding only 1 slow rotator out of 15 when the expectation is 65 per cent is @xmath41 , ruling out case iii at high confidence .",
    "this suggests that without some correspondence between rotation and inflation , the li ",
    "rotation correlation in the pleiades can not be produced .",
    "none of the first three cases resemble the observed pattern , but they collectively point towards a resolution . as noted , the locus of slow rotators in the a(li ) plane is accurately predicted by case i , the locus of rapid rotators is accurately predicted by case ii , and the  dependence of the median and width are produced by a range of radius anomalies from 010 per cent , as in case iii .",
    "if the li depletion history of slow rotators was similar to those in the case i mapping ( i.e. no radius anomaly ) , and the depletion history of rapid rotators was similar to those in the case ii mapping ( i.e. @xmath1010 per cent radius anomaly ) , the li  rotation correlation in the pleiades would be produced , and the  dependence of the median and dispersion may be preserved . following this logic , our last class of models assumes a correlation between rotation rate and inflation factor , such that rapid rotators are physically larger than slow rotators .",
    "we implement case iv as follows . the maximum radius anomaly in our grid",
    "( 10 per cent ) is assigned to the stars that achieve  @xmath10 0.5 days at 10 myr , our fastest rotators .",
    "the radius anomalies of slower rotators are then determined by a power law , which extends down to a cut - off rotation period , below which stars are un - inflated .",

    "@xmath46 represents the power - law exponent of the relation .",
    "thus , stars rotating slower than @xmath45 at 10 myr will have no radius inflation , stars rotating faster than @xmath45 but slower than @xmath44 at 10 myr will have an inflation factor between 0 and 10 per cent , and stars spinning at @xmath44 at 10 myr will have a 10 per cent radius inflation .",

    "* ) , and our maximum anomaly was chosen to coincide with the upper envelope of claimed anomalies in the literature , as previously stated .    with this methodology , we first test a linear scaling ( @xmath46 = 1 ) , with a transition period @xmath45 = 2 days . this version of eq .",

    "the behaviour of the models is striking .",
    "unlike cases i and ii , where a shorter  always results in a lower abundance , the response of case iv models to shorter  is mass dependent .",
    "higher mass models ( e.g. 1.2 ) always cool down and deplete more with greater rotation , whereas lower mass models ( e.g. 0.8 ) show a more complicated relation . for long greater",
    "rotation induces more depletion , since none of these models are inflated in our chosen mapping .",
    "for intermediate greater rotation actually _ inhibits _ depletion , since intermediate rotation (  @xmath10 0.7 myr ) has a smaller effect on li depletion than intermediate inflation (  @xmath10 0.05 ; see fig . [",
    "fig : infltracksinf ] ) . finally for short , mixing again dominates , and the li abundance decreases with faster rotation .",
    "the overall trend is that shorter disc - locking times drive the models to the upper right of this figure , and increase their pleiades - age rotation rate .",
    "the case iv synthetic distribution derived from the empirical pleiades pattern appears in panel d. unlike the first three cases , several salient qualitative features of the empirical distribution are reproduced by this mapping .",
    "first , the locus of slow rotators roughly corresponds to the lower envelope of the pleiades distribution , just as in case i. second , the most rapid rotators lie above and to the cool side of this locus , roughly corresponding to the locus of rapid rotators in the empirical pattern , as in case ii .",
    "this morphology is due in part to the decreased rate of li destruction on the pre - ms , and in part to the reduced  of rapidly rotating , inflated stars .",
    "third , a significant dispersion sets in around 5500k and increases towards cooler temperatures , in excellent agreement with the pleiades . it can be understood why this occurs at 5500k from the case iv map .",
    "rapid rotation displaces stars horizontally towards cooler temperatures in the a(li ) plane ; this horizontal path coincides with the slow rotators above 5500k , but lies above the slow rotators at lower temperatures , since these stars are strongly depleted .",
    "the  decrement due to rotation and inflation is of a similar magnitude for all masses , but the effect on the observed distribution is more apparent in the sub - solar regime .",
    "one location where the models conspicuously fail is the coolest rapid rotators ; four stars near 4500k are predicted to have a(li )  @xmath27  1.5 by our models , but are actually more heavily depleted by 0.5 - 1 dex .",
    "this may reflect a deficiency in our modeling of radius anomalies , which does not account for changes as a function of mass and evolutionary state .",
    "for instance , the true maximal radius anomaly could decrease with mass , so that depletion factors among the fastest spinning k dwarfs are larger than we have predicted .    despite the _ ad hoc _ nature of our ( )",
    "scaling , this model succeeds at accurately predicting several puzzling features of the observed pleiades distribution .",
    "however , one could reasonably contend that fine tuning may be required to achieve this qualitative agreement . to address this concern , we assess the generality of the case iv agreement by calculating synthetic cluster distributions resulting from different choices of @xmath46 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : inflate ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : many_clusters ] ) . from left",
    "to right we increase the power law exponent ( @xmath46 ) , and from top to bottom we decrease the rotation rate at which inflation sets in ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the initial conditions were derived for each individual case using the specified inflation prescription , and the same run of  and a(li ) errors was applied to each . from this plot , we see that some features of the case iv mapping are generic , such as the population of rapid rotators to the upper right of the main locus of slow rotators , and the onset of dispersion at @xmath47k .",
    "other features of the synthetic pattern vary from mapping to mapping , such as the number of rapid rotators that lie near the bottom of the abundance distribution below 5500k ( approximately half for @xmath48 day , none for @xmath49 days ; the dependence on @xmath46 is negligible ) .",
    "never the less , since the important qualitative features of the pleiades pattern are generically reproduced by each considered version of eq .",
    "[ eqn : inflate ] , we conclude that fine tuning is not essential for the conclusions of this section .    to summarise @xmath14[sec : case4 ] , the three qualitative features of the empirical pattern described at the beginning of @xmath14[sec : section4 ] are reproduced by a relationship between rapid rotation and inflation , and these qualitative features are largely insensitive to the exact choice of mapping function .",
    "we conclude that case iv strongly outperforms each of the limiting cases , and produces an observational pattern consistent with the pleiades .",
    "we have presented the first consistent physical model that replicates the qualitative pattern of li and rotation observed in the pleiades .",

    "we consider both the inhibition of convection by magnetic fields , and the impact of mass accretion during the proto - stellar phase .",
    "next , we discuss a method for detecting radius dispersions on the pre - ms and beyond , as a test of our scenario and as a means to constrain the putative connection between rotation and inflation .",
    "our paradigm assumes the existence of a mechanism which reduces the temperature at the base of the convection zone across the observed range of rapid rotators on the pre - ms .",
    "this behaviour naturally results from an increase in the stellar radius , so we have developed our models in the context of radius anomalies correlating with rotation .",
    "there is observational support for this effect from young clusters and associations @xcite , and from pre - ms eclipsing binaries @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss two possible mechanisms for inducing a rotation - radius correlation .",
    "we have modelled radius inflation as a product of inhibited convective efficiency .",
    "this may result as a direct consequence of rapid rotation , when extreme coriolis forces begin to govern the behaviour of convective particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we focus on the suppression of convection produced by rotationally - generated magnetic fields .",
    "magnetic fields in the envelopes of low mass stars can disrupt the motions of charged particles when they attempt to cross field lines .",
    "this leads to an increase in the convective energy flux per unit area in the non - magnetic regions , forcing the radius to expand in order to match the flux emanating from the core @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this effect is the formation of star spots on the surface , which result from the inefficient heat flux induced by magnetism .",
    "several authors have taken this approach , and considered the impact of spots on the radii of stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "polytropic models show that a filling factor of @xmath100.350.51 is sufficient to achieve a k dwarf inflation @xmath1010 per cent , consistent with filling factors @xmath100.20.4 found on active g and k dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this behaviour appears particularly effective in stars with deep convection zones @xcite , and so may be effective on the pre - ms .",
    "magnetic fields can also provide pressure support in stellar interiors , thus working to counteract the force of gravity similar to rotational support @xcite .",
    "each of these effects serves to puff the radius up in stellar models , leading to a reduced temperature in the convection zone .",
    "while these effects would naturally produce the type of correlation we require , activity studies of pre - ms clusters have found that most young stars of ages @xmath10 115 myr are saturated , meaning that the strength of their magnetic field proxies ( i.e. x - rays ) no longer correlate with rotation rate @xcite .",
    "the predominate interpretation of this result is that magnetic fields cease to increase in strength beyond the critical rossby number at which saturation sets in ( @xmath50 ; * ? ? ?",
    "if true , it would appear difficult for convection to be progressively inhibited by rapid rotation among pre - ms stars .",
    "however , an alternative interpretation is that magnetic field proxies decouple from the strength of the surface field at the onset of saturation , so that magnetic fields can continue to grow with rotation without impacting proxies .",
    "for instance , saturation could represent a threshold above which chromospheric and coronal heating can not increase , but the spot filling factor can ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternatively , the spot filling factor could saturate , but the spot temperature could continue to decrease with greater rotation .",
    "several studies have attempted to measure directly the magnetic field strengths of saturated stars and have found mixed results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their efforts are hampered by the extreme difficulty of inferring zeeman broadening from stars whose lines are already highly broadened by rotation @xcite . due to these observational issues ,",
    "the continued inhibition of convection with greater rotation in the saturated regime remains unresolved at present , but further work in this area will ultimately favour or disfavour this mechanism as a viable avenue .",
    "mass accretion may also play an important role in determining pre - ms radii .",
    "proto - stars accrete the majority of their mass during the first @xmath51  yr , when the initial core of @xmath52  gains material from the surrounding over - density in its natal molecular cloud .",
    "accretion likely progresses at a modest level ( @xmath53@xmath54 yr@xmath55 ) , interspersed with short bursts of vigorous accretion ( @xmath56@xmath57 yr@xmath55 ) until the final mass is assembled ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a major unknown factor in this picture is the amount of thermal energy deposited during these intense accretion bursts . `",
    "cold accretion ' scenarios assert that all of the accreted thermal energy is radiated away at the photosphere , so only mass ( and not entropy ) is added to the proto - star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this additional mass leads to a contraction of the radius . alternatively , ` hot accretion ' scenarios suggest that a substantial fraction of the thermal energy of the accreted material is absorbed into the stellar envelope .",
    "this type of accretion can increase stellar radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in either case , a dispersion in radii will arise from differing accretion histories , and may persist throughout the pre - ms due to the lengthy thermal readjustment times .",
    "this leads to a range of li depletion efficiencies during the epoch of standard burning @xcite .",
    "if hot accretion is accompanied by substantial angular momentum deposition , or if the rotation period of cold accretors remains fixed during radius contraction due to magnetic interactions with circumstellar material , then the necessary rotation correlation will be likewise present .",
    "this scenario makes two interesting predictions .",
    "one , that the rotational history of stars is intrinsically linked to their accretion history .",
    "two , that radius inflation is only a transient event on the pre - ms , and therefore will be gone by the age of the pleiades , leaving behind a li dispersion as a fossil record of early time inflation .",
    "the debate in the literature about hot versus cold accretion scenarios remains unsettled @xcite , so further work remains to determine precisely how accretion impacts stellar radii on the early pre - ms .",
    "while these mechanisms are fundamentally different , their impact on the structure at the base of the convection zone will be analogous .",
    "any increase in the stellar radius moves the base of the convection zone outwards , reducing the rate of li depletion , and any decrease in the stellar radius has the opposite effect .",
    "we therefore believe that the results of @xmath14[sec : section3][sec : section4 ] hold in the presence of a radius dispersion , regardless of the underlying cause . given recent efforts to probe the radius  rotation connection in young stars",
    ", constraints may soon be placed on the connection between these two properties during the pre - ms .",
    "@xcite claimed that the average radius of the pleiades k dwarfs is inflated by @xmath1010 per cent , but they did not attempt to characterise the distribution about this average . if a radius dispersion was present in the pleiades at @xmath1010 myr , as required by our theory , then a remnant of the dispersion might still exist today .",
    "detection of a radius dispersion at 125 myr would have important implications not only for the evolution of li , but for the structure of stars on the pre - ms , the behaviour of saturated stars , and the effects of spots and magnetic fields on stellar radii .",
    "a viable avenue for testing whether a spread is present in the pleiades is through obtaining surface gravities for a large number of cluster members .",
    "if rapidly rotating pleiads are physically larger than slowly rotating pleiads , a dispersion in  at fixed colour arises due to three compounding effects .",
    "first , a radius increase of @xmath1010 per cent naturally reduces the surface gravity ( g @xmath58 m / r@xmath59 ) compared to non - inflated stars at fixed colour .",
    "second , the most inflated stars are very rapidly rotating ; rapid rotation reduces  at fixed mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : infltracksrot ] ) , enhancing the effect at fixed temperature .",
    "third , since inflation also reduces , the most inflated stars at fixed colour are also the most massive",
    ". surface gravity decreases with increasing mass , because r is proportional to m in the solar regime ( g @xmath58 m / r@xmath59 @xmath58 m / m@xmath59 @xmath58 1/m ) , leading to an additional reduction in the @xmath60 of the most inflated ( most massive ) stars at fixed colour .    for a 10 per cent dispersion in radius ,",
    "our models predict that the  dispersion could be as large as 0.2 dex at fixed colour .",
    "this signal may be detectable through granulation - induced light curve flicker @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time - scale of the formation and dissolution of convective cells on the surface of stars is proportional to the surface gravity .",
    "this induces a correlation between the power of short time - scale luminosity variations and the strength of surface gravity , permitting the inference of stellar  with an accuracy of 0.10.15 dex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this signal can be extracted from high precision , long baseline , short cadence photometry , such as that obtained by the @xmath61 satellite .",
    "although its mission has ended , @xmath61 s descendant @xmath62 will observe a field containing the pleiades in early 2015 @xcite , and despite the degraded photometric quality , may be able to detect granulation flicker at the necessary level .",
    "this offers a unique opportunity to detect and characterise the distribution of surface gravities , and search for a dispersion about the inflated mean",
    ".    this test will open the door for using li abundances to understand differential pre - ms stellar structure , but much work remains to be done in order to correctly interpret the information .",
    "first , we must determine the mechanism driving the putative connection between rotation and inflation .",
    "if magnetic fields are responsible , how do they impact stellar structure in the saturated regime ? if accretion is responsible , is the cold or hot scenario more appropriate , and how do they impart the angular momentum distribution ? if differential radius inflation on the pre - ms is not responsible for the observed li dispersion , then how is it formed ?",
    "second , we must understand the mass , rotation , and age dependence of radius inflation on the ms .",
    "@xmath62 will place constraints on this mechanism , since it will measure surface gravities in a large number of clusters of different ages , and track the evolution of anomalies along the ms .",
    "third , the systematic effects plaguing the precise determination of li abundances and effective temperatures in rapidly rotating k dwarfs must be resolved .",
    "these include the shifting spectral energy distributions driven by surface spots , the blending of the li absorption line with nearby lines due to rotation , and the effects of active chromospheres on line formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "once accurate  and abundances can be determined , the true rate of li depletion for individual stars on the pre - ms can be derived , and the magnitude of the li dispersion at fixed mass , and hence the degree of radius inflation on the pre - ms , will be revealed .",
    "finally , observations of the surface gravity distribution of the pleiades can only provide circumstantial evidence in favour of our theory . detecting a dispersion in radii correlated with rotation in a @xmath1010 myr old cluster , or detecting a correlation between rotation at li abundance at fixed temperature in a 1020 myr cluster , will serve as the decisive test of an inflationary origin for the observed li  rotation correlation .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the simultaneous impact of rotation and radius inflation on the depletion of lithium from stellar models during the pre - ms .",
    "our goal is to describe the generic features of a mechanism which would bring the predictions of rotational mixing into concordance with the well - known li ",
    "rotation correlation in the k dwarfs of the pleiades .",
    "such a mechanism must suppress li destruction in rapid rotators relative to slow rotators , thus overcoming the trend predicted by rotational mixing calculations .",
    "as radius anomalies @xmath1010 per cent are sometimes found in rapidly rotating stars , and a increased radius is known to inhibit li depletion in standard models , we are motivated to test whether a correlation between rotation and radius inflation on the pre - ms ( induced by some physical process neglected in standard stellar models ) could be responsible for the observed pattern .",
    "we first reviewed the impact of rotation and inflation on the evolution of li abundances . in accordance with previous studies ,",
    "we find that the depletion of li is a strong function of both properties , such that rotation _ increases _ the rate of li destruction , and radius inflation , modeled by a reduction of the mixing length parameter , _ decreases _ the rate of li destruction . while this behaviour is straight forward , the picture becomes far more complicated when the two effects are combined .",
    "rapid rotation and substantial radius inflation ( 10 per cent ) enhances li depletion for stars with @xmath63 , but inhibits li depletion for stars with @xmath64 , relative to non - rotating benchmarks .",
    "this is the first new result of our work , and implies that if the radii of just the rapid rotators in the pleiades were inflated by 10 per cent during the pre - ms , while the radii of the slow rotators agreed with standard predictions , then a positive correlation between the rate of rotation and the abundance of li at 125 myr could arise in k dwarfs , in agreement with observations .",
    "next , we assessed whether this qualitative notion could explain the observed relationship between li and rotation in the pleiades . to do this , we generated synthetic cluster distributions derived from the empirical /rotation distribution of the pleiades which obey various inflation / rotation prescriptions , and compared them to the empirical pleiades pattern .",
    "first , we found that three limiting cases , which represent distinct classes of physical models , were unable to reproduce the pleiades pattern : no radius inflation in all stars regardless of rotation , uniform radius inflation of 10 per cent in all stars regardless of rotation , and radius inflation uncorrelated with rotation .",
    "next , we adopted a prescription where rapidly rotating stars are more inflated than slowly rotating stars , and found that observed pattern in the pleiades is generically produced .",
    "the dispersion in li remains small around the solar temperature and increases to greater than an order - of - magnitude towards cooler temperatures , precisely as is found in the pleiades .",
    "moreover , the median abundance trend is accurately reproduced , and rapidly rotating stars are found to be more rich in li than slowly rotating stars in the k dwarf regime .",
    "furthermore , we found that these qualitative features are insensitive to the precise details of the rotation / inflation prescription we adopt as long as more rapid rotation leads to greater inflation , demonstrating that fine tuning is not required to achieve this level of agreement .",
    "this is the first consistent physical explanation for the pleiades li pattern to date , so we conclude that it is a strong candidate for explaining the observed pattern .    after establishing that a connection between rotation and inflation could explain the pleiades pattern , we discussed what sort of physical mechanisms might lead to this correlation .",
    "the inhibition of convection due to strong magnetic fields in rapid rotators could lead to such a correlation if field strengths continue to grow with rotation in the saturated regime .",
    "accretion could also alter the radii and rotational histories of proto - stars , plausibly inducing the observed correlation .",
    "finally , we suggest that the remnants of a pre - ms radius dispersion may still be present in the pleiades , and a survey of stellar surfaces gravities in this cluster could place strong constraints on the radius dispersion needed at 10 myr to produce the observed pattern .",
    "the ongoing @xmath62 mission offers a valuable opportunity to perform this experiment ."
