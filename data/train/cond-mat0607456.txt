    "quantum hall systems , i.e. , two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) under strong magnetic fields , exhibit a variety of novel physical phenomena @xcite . besides the widely known quantum hall effects , these systems also display quantum hall ferromagnetism  an spontaneously formed spin - polarized many - body state arising from the interplay of the zeeman , coulomb , and thermal energy scales within the highly - degenerate landau states of the 2deg @xcite .",
    "quantum hall ferromagnetism has been experimentally investigated via magneto - transport measurements of the longitudinal @xmath2 and hall @xmath3 resistances in both the integer and fractional quantum hall regimes .",
    "a crucial ingredient in these experiments is the occurrence of opposite - spin landau level crossings @xcite near the fermi energy . at these crossings",

    "the above results seem to corroborate the conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ringlike shapes of the structures should be due to density - dependent exchange - correlation effects .",
