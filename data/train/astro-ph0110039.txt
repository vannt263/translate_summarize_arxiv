    "the black hole candidate gx3394 was discovered by with the _ oso-7 _ satellite and was soon noted for its similarity in x - ray behaviour to the classical black hole candidate cygx1 (; ; ) .",
    "the source exhibits aperiodic and quasi - periodic modulations on time scales spanning milliseconds to years and over a wide range of wavelengths . unlike typical soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) which are barely detected in their quiescent state",
    ", gx3394 spends most of the time in the so - called x - ray low / hard state ( ls ) like a faint persistent source . during the ls",
    ", the energy spectrum can be described as a power - law with photon index of @xmath0  1.52 ( see appendix for full list of references ) .",
    "it changes to the high / soft state ( hs ) occasionally ( e.g. ) which are similar to the outbursts of transient sources . during the hs",
    ", it becomes brighter ( in the 210 kev band ) by a factor of @xmath0  5100 ( see e.g. , and references therein ) and exhibits an ultra - soft spectral component plus a steeper power - law component .",
    "the ` low ' and ` high ' states referred to here are also called the ` hard ' and ` soft ' states so as to reflect the spectral behaviour . however , the luminosity of the ` low ' state can sometimes be higher than the ` high ' state ( see appendix ) and hence it can be confusing to define the ` state ' solely by the intensity of the x - rays",
    ". therefore , a knowledge of the x - ray spectra are essential to distinguish different states accurately ( see table 1 of for the spectral and temporal properties of different states ) .",
    "in addition to the ls and hs , gx3394 exhibits a very high state ( vhs ; ) with a higher x - ray luminosity than in the hs ( by a factor of @xmath0  3 ) . note that the vhs also occurs in several other black hole soft x - ray transients ( bhsxts ) : gs1124683 @xcite , xte1550564 @xcite and xtej1748288 @xcite .",
    "an intermediate state ( is ) in e.g. gx3394 @xcite and 4u163047 @xcite has also been reported and its spectral and timing properties are similar to the vhs but with a much lower luminosity .",
    "finally , every now and then gx3394 enters an ` off ' state ( see ; ; ; ; ) , in which the x - ray fast time variability and spectral shape are consistent with that seen in the ls ( ) , except that the 210  kev flux is at least @xmath1 times lower than in the ls .",
    "it was concluded that the ` off ' state is indeed an extension of the ls , but with lower luminosity (; ) .",
    "it is worth noting that gx3394 and gs1124683 @xcite are the only x - ray sources observed in all these states ; however , only gx3394 visits the different states so frequently ( except for the vhs ) .",
    "we show in figures 13 the different states of gx3394 in the past 30 years .",
    "x - ray variability on long timescales ( from days to years ) has been found in many low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries , but its origin is still an open question ( e.g. ) .",
    "long - term x - ray variability has also been seen in the persistent black hole candidates cygx1 ( e.g. ) and lmcx3 ( e.g. ) .",
    "the timescales of their variability range from 100 days to 300 days . given the similarity in x - ray properties between gx3394 and cygx1 , it is intriguing to investigate the long - term x - ray variability of gx3394 .",
    "we therefore exploit the long - term capabilities of the all sky monitoring instruments on board the _ vela 5b _ , _ ariel 5 _ , _ ginga _ , _ compton gamma ray observatory _ and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ to study the x - ray behaviour of this source on timescales of months to years .",
    "gx3394 has been monitored by several x - ray missions in the last 30 years .",
    "we describe below all the instruments which contribute to the long - term x - ray light curves for this work .",
    "in addition , a new _ bepposax _",
    "observation of the source during the ` off ' state is reported so that we can have a better understanding of the current status of the source .",
    "gx3394 has also been studied by other pointed observations which are summarised in the appendix .",
    "the _ vela 5b _ satellite @xcite monitored the x - ray sky from 1969 august to 1976 august ( mjd 4036743937 ) in two energy channels , 312 kev and 612 kev , the archival results of which are available from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .",
    "the light curve ( see fig .  [ fig : av ] ) is made up from 508 data points using only the first channel ( 312 kev ) since it has higher signal - to - noise ratio compared to the second channel ( 612  kev ) . due to its limited temporal resolution and sensitivity ,",
    "the data points exhibit a large scatter and only some outburst - like events were detected .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a hs at @xmath0  mjd  41370 and 41660 ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : av ] ) according to the pointed observations made by satellite _ oso-7 _",
    "( , see appendix ) ; however the intensity is not that high comparing to other data points .",
    "the _ ariel 5 _ asm experiment @xcite consisted of a pair of x - ray pinhole cameras with position sensitive proportional counters ( 36 kev ) that covered 75% of the sky during each orbit ( @xmath0100mins ) . from the archival heasarc _ ariel 5 _ database",
    ", we obtained 2605 data points on gx3394 spanning the period from 1974 october to 1980 march ( mjd 4233844308 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : av ] ) . note that part of the _ ariel 5 _ data was collected simultaneously with the _ vela 5b _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : av ] ) and the count rate variations are consistent with each other . as for the _",
    "vela 5b _ data , the light curve shows considerable scatter as well as some clear flaring episodes .",
    "no pointed observations were carried out in this period and hence the x - ray ` state ' of the source is not clear .",
    "the _ ginga _  asm @xcite monitored the x - ray sky in the 120  kev band from 1987 february to 1991 october .",
    "the effective area of the _ ginga _  asm was about 420  @xmath2 with a @xmath3 field - of - view .",
    "the sky - scanning observations were performed at intervals of a few days and covered about 70% of the sky .",
    "the typical exposure time for each scan across each observed source is about 318  s. during the observations from 1987 march to 1991 october ( mjd 4686048531 ) , 215 data points were collected and it is very clear that four state transitions are seen in the light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ginga ] ) , indicating excursions from the ls to the vhs / hs .",
    "the ls , hs and vhs state identifications were confirmed by the energy and power spectra obtained with the _ ginga _  lac @xcite , _ granat _ @xcite and batse @xcite instruments . during the ls , the corresponding flux is always below 100  mcrab ( 16  kev ) and in 1988 august ( @xmath0 mjd 47374 ) , the source flux increased dramatically up to 1  crab in @xmath0  10 days .",
    "subsequent _ ginga _  lac observations in 1988 september ( @xmath0 mjd 47405 ) revealed that the source was in a vhs .",
    "the flux then decreased to about 500  mcrab over @xmath0  55 days , which presumably returned to the hs . by the end of 1989 ,",
    "the source again went to the ls until the other ls / hs transition between 1990 august and december ( @xmath0 mjd 4810448226 ) .",
    "the last ls / hs transition observed by _ ginga _  took place in 1991 august which was observed simultaneously with batse and will be discussed in  [ sec : batse ] .",
    "the all sky monitor ( asm ; ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; ) has monitored gx3394 several times daily in its 212 kev pass - band since 1996 february .",
    "the source remained at a low flux level ( @xmath4  asm cts / s or 27  mcrab ) until early 1998 january ( @xmath0 mjd 50810 ) although some variations were seen ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : batse ] ) .",
    "extensive pointed proportional counter array ( pca ) observations during this period indicate that it was in the ls @xcite .",
    "after mjd 50800 , the source flux increased dramatically to @xmath5 asm cts / s ( 270  mcrab ) where it stayed for about 200 days before declining .",
    "reported that the source underwent a ls to hs transition , probably through an is ( @xmath0 mjd 50820 ) .",
    "the source changed back to the ls again in 1999 february ( @xmath0 mjd 51200 ) .",
    "after 1999 june ( @xmath0 mjd 51330 ) , the asm count rate dropped further and the source intensity fell below the 3-@xmath6 detection level .",
    "found that the source entered the ` off ' state at that time from _ bepposax _  and optical observations .",
    "note that the asm count rate is also correlated with the hard x - rays as observed by batse ( see next subsection ) .",
    "interestingly , radio emission is also correlated with the x - ray during these different states @xcite .      the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ was operated continuously from april 5 , 1991 ( mjd 48351 ) until its re - entry on june 4 , 2000 ( mjd 51699 ) .",
    "batse consists of eight identically configured detector modules with energy channels spanning from 20 to 600 kev ( see ) .",
    "the gx3394 observations presented here were taken from the archival database which consists of data from 1991 april to 1999 august ( mjd 4837050554 ) in the 20100  kev band . in constructing the light curve ,",
    "the detector count rate is obtained by the earth occultation technique @xcite and is fitted by an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) model at a fixed temperature @xmath7  kev @xcite , resulting in the photon fluxes presented here .",
    "the data presented in fig.[fig : batse ] were rebinned by a factor of 2 .    the batse light curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : batse ] ) shows about ten hard x - ray outbursts . the first hard x - ray outburst in 1991 august ( @xmath0 mjd  48470 ) was accompanied by _ ginga _",
    "asm observations and two pointed observations by _ granat _ ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : batse ] ) .",
    "the soft and hard x - rays are more or less correlated until the hard x - rays reached maximum .",
    "the hard x - rays then decreased sharply and the source became very soft with a much steeper power law spectrum @xcite ; the source changed from the ls ( as observed with the _ ginga _  asm ) to the hs .",
    "the hs lasted for about 70 days , during which near - simultaneous radio data were available @xcite and then the source entered a possible ` off ' state due to the non - detection of soft x - ray emission in the 310 kev band @xcite .",
    "the source then underwent three major hard x - ray outbursts before 1996 ( mjd 50083 ) and a detailed energy spectral analysis of the batse data was presented by and . in particular , the second one ( mjd  4934049420 ) is similar to the very first outburst ( observed by _ ginga _",
    "observations ) , and radio observations @xcite suggest that the duration of the hs ( after the sharp decrease in flux at @xmath0  mjd  49420 ) is also about 70 days .",
    "it is not clear whether there is a hs occurring between mjd  4900049300 and mjd  4950050100 since there is no soft x - ray and/or pointed data , but radio observations after mjd  49500 indicate that the source stayed in the ls @xcite .    after the launch of _ rxte _ ,",
    "the source was monitored regularly by both the _ rxte_/asm and batse and it is easily seen in the simultaneous light curves that the soft and hard x - rays are ( anti ) correlated in their gross behaviour , as already suggested from the simultaneous _ ginga _  asm and batse light curves . in addition , some ` mini'-outbursts with shorter recurrence times were also seen in the batse light curve .",
    "extensive pointed _ rxte _",
    "observations suggest that the source was in the ls during these periods @xcite .",
    "batse initially observed three strong outbursts with near equal intensities and separations ( @xmath8 days ) , the subsequent outbursts clearly show that the time between outbursts was variable , with a significant correlation between outburst fluence and time since the last outburst @xcite .",
    "the source changed from the ls to hs in 1998 january ( @xmath0 mjd  50814 ) according to _ rxte _",
    "( asm and pca ) observations @xcite and the batse flux dropped to below significant detection levels .",
    "such a ls / hs transition was also accompanied by non - detection of radio emission @xcite .",
    "the hs ended in 1999 february ( @xmath0 mjd  51210 ) and the return to the ls was accompanied by the reappearance of the hard x - rays and radio emission @xcite .",
    "following the ls , the source entered the ` off ' state ( see  [ sec:339rxte ] ) with a small drop in the batse flux .",
    "we observed gx3394 with the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board _ bepposax _ between march 23.9 and 24.6 , 2000 ut . the nfi consist of two co - aligned imaging instruments providing a field of view of @xmath9 : the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; 0.110 kev ; parmar et al .",
    "1997a ) and the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ; 1.610.5 kev ; boella et al .",
    "the other two nfi , non - imaging instruments are the phoswich detector system ( pds ; 12300kev ; frontera et al . 1997 ) and the high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hp  gspc ; 4120 kev ; manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "following the reduction procedures outlined by , we applied an extraction radius of @xmath10 centred on the source position for both lecs and mecs images so as to obtain the source spectra .",
    "the mecs background was extracted by using long archival exposures on empty sky fields . for the lecs spectrum , we extracted the background from two semi - annuli in the same field of view as the source ( see parmar et al .",
    "1999 for the reduction procedure ) .",
    "both the extracted spectra were rebinned by a factor of 3 so as to accumulate at least 20 photons per bin and to sample the spectral full - width at half - maximum resolution ( fiore et al .",
    "a systematic error of 1% was added to both lecs and mecs spectra to take account of the systematic uncertainties in the detector calibrations ( guainazzi et al .",
    "data were selected in the energy ranges 0.84.0 kev ( lecs ) , 1.810.5 kev ( mecs ) and 15220 kev ( pds ) to ensure a better instrumental calibration ( fiore et al .",
    "a normalization factor was included for the lecs and pds relative to the mecs in order to correct for the nfi s flux intercalibration ( see fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the source was only detected in the 110  kev range , and the broad - band ( 110 kev ) spectrum of gx3394 from the lecs and mecs data is satisfactorily ( @xmath11 for 33 degrees of freedom ) fitted by a single power - law with photon index of @xmath12 plus absorption .",
    "we fixed the @xmath13 at @xmath14  @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the absorbed flux in the 210  kev band is @xmath16  erg @xmath15s@xmath17 .",
    "from the light curves shown in the above section , gx3394 underwent several state transitions and showed quasi - periodic variability in the past 30 years .",
    "we therefore exploit the data collected from different instruments to characterise its overall variability . in order to search for periodic phenomena",
    ", we used the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ; hereafter lsp ) , a modification of the discrete fourier transform which is generalised to the case of uneven spacing .",
    "we have also employed the phase dispersion minimisation ( pdm ; ) to check the results from the lsp , as the pdm is sensitive to non - sinusoidal modulations . for the _ rxte _  asm data ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : batse ] ) , we first excluded the most recent hs and ` off ' state ( after mjd 50815 ) from the dataset as the flat - topped hs will dominate the lsp and the data from the ` off ' state are non - detection . by applying the lsp ,",
    "a broad peak was found at periods around 190240  d , centered at 213  d ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : combine_pow]a ) .",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : combine_pow]a the 99% significance level for both white noise ( gaussian ) and red noise . in determining the white - noise confidence level",
    ", we generate gaussian noise datasets with the same time intervals and variance as the true data and then perform the lsp analysis on the resulting datasets . the peak power in each periodogram ( which must be purely due to noise )",
    "was then recorded .",
    "this was repeated 10,000 times for good statistics .",
    "however , the noise is not necessarily gaussian , it can also be frequency dependent with a higher power at lower frequencies . by using the above method , strong peaks at the low frequencies might give misleading results . in order to take into account such a noise contribution in the data ,",
    "we simulate the noise as a power law , which is also known as red noise ( e.g. ) .",
    "quantitatively , the power spectrum of the red - noise light curve will be given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is frequency .",
    "following an implementation of the method of , we generate simulated light curves with the red - noise power spectrum , together with the same time sampling and mean variance as the original data .",
    "finally , we combine the white - noise simulated light curve as mentioned above , with the red - noise simulated light curve , by scaling the data points in each such that the relative contribution of both white and red - noise components is matched with the real data . following the method used previously to determine the white - noise confidence level",
    ", we derive the red - noise confidence level with the combined simulated light curve .",
    "since red noise is frequency dependent , we need to compute the confidence level for a set of frequency bins .",
    "hence it appears as a histogram rather than the continuous line for white - noise ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : combine_pow ] ) .",
    "the peak at 190240  d is well above the 99% confidence levels ( as determined by both methods ) and we conclude that it is highly significant .",
    "the folded light curve of our _ rxte _ asm data on 228  d ( which is consistent with the peaks in the _ rxte _ , batse , _ ginga _  and _ vela 5b _ periodograms , and such that they are all on a common ephemeris for intercomparison of the structure so as to see whether the variability is stable ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fold ] ; t@xmath20 is defined by the first data point of _ vela 5b_. analysis with the pdm gave similar results to the lsp .    for the batse data , ten outbursts occurred during the past 7 years and like the _ rxte _  asm data",
    ", we exclude the recent high / soft and ` off ' state ( after mjd  50800 ) in calculating the lsp .",
    "the lsp shows a strong peak at @xmath21 days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : combine_pow]b ) which is consistent with the _ rxte _ asm result .",
    "the peak is very distinct and exceeds the 99% confidence level of both white and red noise .",

    "the _ ginga _  asm monitored the source for 4.5 years and the four ls / hs / vhs state transitions on timescales of @xmath0  200400 d are seen ( see fig .  [",

    "however , the sparse sampling prevents us from calculating a good lsp .",
    "nevertheless , we include all the data points in searching for any variability .",

    "it should be noted that two hs occurred during these observations ( see appendix ; ) and hence the results should be interpreted with great caution .",
    "the strongest peak in the periodogram of the _ vela 5b _ data is at @xmath0  365 days and is caused by an annual variation in the spacecraft environment @xcite .",
    "the lsp reveals a second peak at 232  d which is just above the 99% confidence level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : combine_pow]d ) .",
    "although the sensitivity of _ vela 5b _ is poorer than current x - ray satellites , a clear variability is seen in the light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : av ] ) and the long timebase ( over 10 years ) increases the sensitivity to these timescales .",

    "ls / hs transitions might occur during the _ ariel 5 _ observations but there is no pointed observations to confirm the ` state ' of the source .",
    "we here used all the data in calculating the lsp .",
    "the lsp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : combine_pow]e ) shows a peak near 365 days , again due to the annual variation in the count rate from solar x - ray scattering or fluorescing from the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "through the extensive dataset obtained with the _ cgro_/batse and _ rxte_/asm , we find evidence of variability on timescales @xmath0  190240  d in gx3394 ( it should be noted that the recent hs and ` off ' state data are excluded in both datasets and at least one hs occurred in the batse data ) .",
    "observations from _ ginga _  and _ vela 5b _ also suggest a similar timescale but the data consist of state transitions .",
    "such a variability has been noted previously by for the _ rxte _  asm data .",
    "they also pointed out that the observed long - term x - ray variability is not a strict clocking phenomenon but is more likely to be a characteristic timescale . from our analysis ,",
    "this timescale is also manifested in the batse , _",
    "vela 5b _ data .",
    "in addition , the broad peak in the lsp of the _ rxte _  asm data ( see fig .  [ fig : combine_pow ] ) also hints that such variability is not strictly periodic and can only be regarded as a characteristic timescale . from the folded light curves of different datasets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fold ] ) , the peaks occur almost in anti - phase , suggesting the aperiodic nature . indeed ,",
    "such quasi - periodic long - term variability ( usually referred to as the _ super - orbital _ period ) has also been seen in other x - ray binaries such as cygx2 , lmcx3 and cygx1 ( see e.g. ) , but no clear understanding of its origin has yet been established ( see ) . as noted by , the observed long - term x - ray variability of gx3394 could be due to a combination of a quasi - steadily precessing disc at large radii with coronal structure changes on small radii .",
    "if this is the case , x - ray irradiation can give rise to a precessing disc @xcite and it might even explain the ls / hs transition of the source .",
    "actually , results from the _ ginga _  and _ vela 5b _ data suggest that the ls / hs transitions and the outburst - like events during the low / hard state ( as seen in the _ rxte _  and batse data ) may be due to the same mechanism , although the data is not well - sampled .",
    "therefore , it is possible that such quasi - periodic outbursts might actually be a characteristic precursor to the ls / hs transition . in the next subsection , we will discuss the role of x - ray irradiation in the state transition and also the origin of the long - term x - ray variability .",
    "our _ bepposax _",
    "observations presented here indicate that the source was fainter than the previous observation in 1999 august ( see ) by a factor 3 in half year ; therefore the source is still in the ` off ' state .",
    "the energy spectra of both observations are very similar to those obtained in the ls .",
    "hence , there is no doubt that the ` off ' state is an extended ls ( see discussions by ) and we may now refine the source as a transient rather than a persistent source .",
    "in fact the luminosity during the ` off ' state is in the upper end of the quiescent luminosity of typical x - ray transients ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the results also further confirm that during quiescence , significant x - ray variability can be seen . such variability in quiescence",
    "is also found in several black hole transients such as gs2023 + 338 (; ) , 4u163047 @xcite and a062000 @xcite .      as noted in  [ sec:339rxte ] and [ sec : batse ] , gx3394 underwent a ls / hs transition in 1998 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : batse ] ; also ) which differs somewhat from the previous ones observed with the _ ginga _  asm .",
    "after the source reached the peak of the hs , it spent nearly 200 days at a constant flux level of @xmath0  20 _ rxte_/asm cts / s .",
    "such a flat - topped x - ray light curve for gx3394 is different from the ` standard ' fast - rise exponential decay profile , as observed from various x - ray transients ( see for various examples of different outburst patterns ) .",
    "the state transition mechanism for such a persistent source is still a puzzle and observations in different states suggested that it is most likely associated with the mass accretion rate ( e.g. ) .",
    "a change in the mass accretion rate can be caused by a thermal instability in the accretion disc ( disc instability model , or dim ) and in fact it is widely accepted that the outbursts in bhsxts are due to this mechanism ( e.g. ) .",
    "interestingly , the dim was originally developed to describe the outbursts in dwarf novae ( dn ; see e.g. for a review ) which contain a white dwarf as the compact object ; it was suggested quite early that it also applies in bhsxts ( e.g. ) . in lmxbs , x - ray irradiation can influence the stability of the accretion disc @xcite and thus a dim which includes x - ray irradiation was developed @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the recent hs spectroscopic observations of gx3394 obtained by also indicate that the accretion disc is heated by soft x - ray irradiation , suggesting that irradiation plays a role in the state transition .",
    "irradiation of the outer disc by x - rays from the inner disc gives a stability criterion , from which the minimum mass accretion rate for a stable , steady - state accretion in an x - ray irradiated disc can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the black hole mass , @xmath24 is the mass of the companion , @xmath25 the orbital period in hours .",
    "@xmath26 is a parameter to describe the properties of irradiation through :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the irradiation temperature and @xmath6 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for a stable x - ray irradiated disc during the hs , @xmath29 can be estimated from the hs observations by , in which they have fitted the spectrum with a power law plus a multi - colour disc blackbody model . by using the derived inner disc radius , @xmath30 of @xmath31  km ( where @xmath32 is the distance to the source in units of 4  kpc ; ) and the blackbody temperature , @xmath33 of 0.72  kev , we can calculate the bolometric luminosity of the disc blackbody component as    @xmath34    the accretion rate can be estimated via the relation @xmath35 , which leads to @xmath36  g s@xmath17 if we assume an orbital inclination of about @xmath37 @xcite for a 14.8-hr orbital period @xcite .",
    "assuming an estimated mass of the black hole of 5  @xcite and companion star of 0.4  @xcite , we obtain @xmath38 from eqn .",
    "1 , which is slightly higher than @xmath39 obtained by comparison with other results in the literature ( see ) . according to the scenario outlined above , the mass of the compact object is limited to be @xmath0  35 .    from the previous ls observations ,",
    "the estimated mass accretion rate is about @xmath40  g s@xmath17 ( e.g. ) which is a factor of 3 below the critical accretion rate for a stable disc and hence the disc may be subject to the dim in order to give rise to a ls / hs transition . since the accretion rate during the ls is very close to the critical value , a slight increase in the accretion rate by a small factor would produce a stable disc . as a result , a shorter interval to the next state transition would be expected . unlike the sxts in which the outburst timescale is normally longer than ten years , gx3394 has much more frequent state transitions , as seen in e.g. the _ ginga _  asm data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ginga ] ) .",
    "in fact , the 232-d variability seen in the _ ginga _  and _ vela 5b _ data has already hinted at such behaviour .",
    "the most interesting behaviour of the 1998 hs is that the observed flat - topped x - ray light curve of gx3394 bears characteristics of z cam - type dn in which standstills ( i.e. the brightness remains constant ) occasionally interrupt the recurrent outbursts .",
    "such a scenario can be explained by the dim @xcite in which the accretion rate before standstill is very close to a critical value and a sudden increase in the accretion rate ( e.g. by a starspot or irradiation induced mass overflow ) triggers the standstill state .",
    "the light curve of gx3394 is even more similar to the model proposed by in which the standstill is at a higher luminosity than the normal outbursts . for z cam systems ,",
    "the intensity of the standstills is lower than the maximum of the outbursts ( ) , but we should note that the models for explaining the z cam systems are used to account for optical light curves .",
    "the second similarity between gx3394 and z cam systems concerns the recurrence of outbursts between standstills . from our earlier period analysis of the archival gx3394 data over 30 years",
    ", we find a variability timescale of @xmath0190240  d and we suggest this to be the recurrent outbursting behaviour seen in z cam systems .",
    "as pointed out by dubus et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) , the accretion rate can vary on timescales of 10100 days when a viscously unstable disc is irradiated by a constant x - ray flux .",
    "if irradiation is crucial for determining the accretion rate of gx3394 , this may explain the variability of the ` mini'-outbursts observed during the ls .",
    "there is also an indication that the accretion rate of gx3394 was building up before the hs in 1998 as the average intensity level of both _",
    "asm and batse data has a slight increasing trend especially after mjd  50000 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : batse ] ) .",
    "in addition , the hs occurring at mjd  48550 and 49450 ( see  [ sec : batse ] ) were just after a strong x - ray outburst in the ls ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : batse ] ) .",
    "perhaps this takes the accretion rate in the ls to be close to the critical value and finally triggers the state transition . as a result",
    ", this hs may be simply a strong , prolonged outburst in an otherwise ls .",
    "in fact , from the period analysis of the _ vela 5b _ and _ ginga _  data for which state transitions are included in the calculation , the timescale of variability resembles that found in the _ rxte _  asm data in the ls .",
    "perhaps the ls outbursts may be excursions towards the hs but which they do not quite reach .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect similar spectral evolution during the ls outburst , just like during a state transition .",
    "however , such outbursts are usually short and therefore observations are difficult to arrange .",
    "the most likely observations available are from , in which an _ rxte _",
    "pointed observation of gx3394 was made near the outburst ( mjd  50710 ) just before the ls / hs transition .",
    "although the energy spectrum appeared to be slightly softer , it is still consistent with other ls observations within the uncertainties .",
    "it is worth noting that cygx1 also shows ls / hs transitions occasionally and it has flaring activities during the ls .",
    "moreover , the long hs of cygx1 between 1996 may and august resembles that seen in gx3394 , but with more flares during the hs @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the state transition of cygx1 is due to a similar mechanism to that discussed here ( see however ) .",
    "more recently , lmcx3 was also shown to have recurring state transitions but the driving force is very likely to be due to other mechanisms @xcite .",
    "given that the accretion rate in the ls is close to the critical value , similar ls / hs transitions would be expected in the near future and multi - wavelength observations of such transitions , particularly the correlation between the x - ray , optical and radio emissions will constrain the accretion disc structure and behaviour of the secondary star .",

    "gx3394 has been observed by several x - ray satellites in the past 30 years and the results from those pointed observations are crucial to determine the ` state ' of the source .",
    "we compile here a list of pointed observations of gx3394 from the literature ( see table a1 ) .",
    "note that the ` state ' quoted is determined by spectral and temporal analysis .",
    "although the x - ray flux level can more or less reflect the ` state ' of the source , on several occasions the x - ray flux in the ls is actually higher than the hs ( e.g. 1981 may and 1984 may ) .",
