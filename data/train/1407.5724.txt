    "one of the major challenges in high - energy physics experiments is to detect and analyze majority of the particles produced in the collisions of elementary particles or heavy - ions .",
    "experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and at the planned colliders ( international linear collider or future circular collider ) necessitate accurate energy measurements over a large dynamic range and high precision tracking of the particles emitted in the collisions .",
    "compared to proton - proton collisions , the challenges get manifolded for the heavy - ion ( such as pb - pb ) collisions due to the increase in the number of emitted particles by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a calorimeter  @xcite is normally used for accurate characterization of an incoming particle in terms of its position and energy .",
    "sampling calorimeters , segmented in longitudinal as well as in transverse directions , are considered to be ideal for accurate characterization of particles in terms of their positions and energies .    in this article",
    ", we consider si - w calorimetry , using tungsten as converters / absorbers and segmented silicon pad detectors as active medium .",
    "because of good energy and position resolution characteristics , silicon detectors are considered to provide the most suitable detection medium .",
    "although the silicon pad detectors used here have no intrinsic charge gain , they exhibit good charge collection efficiency , fast response time and require low bias voltage to achieve full depletion .",
    "low sensitivity of silicon detectors to the magnetic field enables the calorimeter to be compatible with complex experimental setup in high magnetic field environment . at the same time , use of tungsten as absorber makes the electromagnetic calorimeter relatively compact and helps to achieve full energy containment .",
    "combination of silicon and tungsten layers offer one of the most novel design for calorimetry in high energy physics experiments  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we report the design of a si - w calorimeter , which can provide accurate position and energy measurement with minimum leakage in both transverse and longitudinal directions . in order to test the feasibility of such a design , a mini - tower , consisting of four layers of silicon pad detectors and tungsten plates as absorbers , has been constructed .",

    "a sampling type electromagnetic calorimeter with silicon detector as active medium and high purity tungsten as absorber has been simulated using geant4 toolkit  @xcite .",
    "the main goal is to optimize the design with adequate energy and position resolutions in order to handle extreme high particle density environment .",

    "being a high - z element , tungsten converts high energy photons or electrons into electromagnetic showers .",
    "the majority of the photons that are emitted in high energy collisions are decay photons from @xmath3 mesons .",
    "one of the major goals is to reconstruct @xmath3 mesons and their energy from the measured photon showers .",
    "the decay angle of the two emitted photons decreases with the increase of the energy of @xmath3 mesons .",
    "the reconstruction of the photon showers needs to be accurate in order to obtain the shower positions of the photons and deposited energy . in order to measure @xmath3 energy accurately , tracking of the shower in different layers",
    "is needed .",
