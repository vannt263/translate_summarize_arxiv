    "spectral observations in radio astronomy are aimed to detect emission or absorption line features that bring us rich information such as intensity , velocity , line width , etc . to acquire a spectrum , signals received by a radio telescope",

    "the performance of a spectral observation is characterized by the spectral resolution , the bandwidth , the sensitivity , and the stability .",
    "a certain bandpass calibration procedure is needed to obtain a desired performance of spectral observations .",
    "an acquired spectrum is a summation of unwanted noise , @xmath6 , and the signal from the target source that is denoted as the antenna temperature , @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral shape is affected by the bandpass response , @xmath8 , that is the transfer function of the receiving system as a function of frequency , @xmath9 .",
    "the acquired on - source spectrum will be then @xmath10 .",
    "bandpass calibration is necessary to estimate @xmath7 from the acquired spectrum , @xmath11 .    in most of radio observations ,",
    "the acquired spectrum is dominated by the system noise , i.e. , @xmath12 . to relieve the source spectrum from the system noise , a spectrum of off - source blank sky adjacent to the target source",
    "is subtracted from the on - source spectrum .",
    "this position - switching scan yields the source spectrum as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spectrum taken from the off - source scan . in conventional position - switching observations , the bandpass @xmath8 is also acquired from the off - source scans because the blank sky emits a featureless flat spectrum . for @xmath15 , equation [ eqn : onoff_subtraction ]",
    "will be @xmath16 the sensitivity of spectal observations is evaluated by a sd ( standard deviation ) , @xmath17 , of the acquired spectrum in line - free channels .",
    "it is derived from equation [ eqn : onoff_subtraction2 ] as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are sds of the on- and off - source spectra , respectively . for weak sources for which @xmath21 , @xmath17 is given by a root of sum squared ( rss ) of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dominated by thermal noise , according to @xcite , they are expected to relate to the integration time , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the spectral resolution , @xmath24 , and @xmath6 as followed , @xmath25 the total telescope time is the sum of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and other overhead time such as setup , system noise measurement , gaps between scans , etc .",
    "optimized scan pattern is designed to maximize the sensitivity , i.e. , to minimize @xmath17 , within the minimal telescope time . conventionally @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equally allocated in position - switching observations to have @xmath26 .",
    "this manner makes the total telescope time longer than twice of @xmath22 and lets @xmath27 .",
    "if there is an efficient way to reduce @xmath20 less than @xmath19 , we can save the total telescope time and get better sensitivity .",
    "for an ideal receiving system , whose bandpass response were known _ a priori _ and very stable , off - source observations would be unnecessary .",
    "modern systems offer better spectral stability in the trend in replacing analog devices with a high - speed digital sampling system in an upper stream of signal transfer .",
    "the bandpass response of a digital system , including a digital filter and a digital spectrometer , is determined by a fixed algorithm and is not affected by environmental variations .",
    "utility of digital devices brings us a possibility to reduce the integration time and the sd of off - source scans .    in this paper",
    "we propose the smoothed bandpass calibration ( sbc ) method where the off - source spectrum is smoothed across the bandwidth to reduce the integration time of the off - source scans and the sd of the spectrum .",
    "section 2 describes the concept of the sbc method .",
    "section 3 reports test experiments that verify the sbc and that quest for the optimal parameters of a smoothing window and a scan pattern . in section 4",
    "we discuss the behavior of the spectral stability and estimate sensitivity improvements expected in some scan patterns .",
    "we propose relevant spectral smoothing along frequency for off - source scans to reduce required integration time that achieves a desired sd . before the spectral smoothing ,",
    "a bandpass correction is employed using a template bandpass response that is presumed to be relevantly static and taken by long - time integration toward blank sky .",
    "the bandpass - corrected off - source spectrum will be almost flat with slight warp due to fluctuations of the receiving system and smeared by thermal noise . in the following subsections we formularize the spectral behavior and establish a strategy to reduce spectral unevenness .      as described in section 1 ,",
    "the purpose of off - source scans is to subtract @xmath6 and calibrate the bandpass , @xmath8 , which is a frequency - dependent system response .",
    "since the bandpass can be time - variable , we denote it as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a static template bandpass and @xmath30 is a fluctuation from @xmath29 . the observed off - source spectrum is composed of not only @xmath31 but also thermal noise , @xmath32 , which is assumed to be attributed to a stochastic random process following the normal distribution with the mean , @xmath33 , and the variance , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the integration time . thus the observed off - source spectrum will be @xmath36 , and its expectation will be @xmath37 .",
    "sufficiently long integration time is required for conventional off - source scans to reduce @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 is relatively smaller than @xmath29 , almost flat and smooth along the frequency , with a typical frequency scale , @xmath39 of variation .",
    "relevant spectral smoothing for off - source spectra efficiently reduces @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath40 and keeps the expectation of off - source spectrum .",
    "since the spectral smoothing will not be applied for on - source spectra , desired spectral resolution will be kept .",
    "the flatness of @xmath30 is evaluated by the spectral allan variance ( sav ) analysis .",

    "sav analysis allows us to decompose @xmath30 from the thermal noise .",
    "an example of sav for an off - source spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : quantization_diagram ] , as a function of the channel spacing , @xmath45 , we used an fx spectrometer whose spectral resolution function is a squared sinc function and @xmath46 by 2048-point fft to produce 1024 ch . ] .",
    "the sav in the 1-min integrated raw spectrum ( @xmath47 ) is decomposed into two components ; ( 1 ) thermal noise , @xmath32 , that dominates in the range of @xmath48 and whose sav has a dependence , @xmath49 and ( 2 ) bandpass characteristics , @xmath31 , that dominates in the range of @xmath50 .",
    "when components ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show approximately symmetric power - law characteristics , the bottom of the sav appears at the frequency span where those two components are almost equivalent ( see results in subsectino 3.2 and discussion in subsection 4.1 ) .",
    "after bandpass correction using a template spectrum , @xmath29 , component ( 2 ) is considerably eliminated as ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the rest fluctuation , @xmath30 , dominates the sav in @xmath52 . as the thermal noise will be reduced via time integration in ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the bottom of the sav shifts to smaller @xmath54 ( e.g. @xmath55 for 546-min integration ) .",
    "relevant spectral smoothing with the smoothing window given by the bottom in sav , as described in the next subsection , will yield efficient reduction of the thermal noise keeping the bandpass response as shown in ( @xmath56 ) .      the relevant smoothing window and on  off scan pattern",
    "should be determined to minimize the sd in the off - source - subtracted spectrum within the given telescope time , or to minimize the total telescope time that achieves the given sd . the best smoothing window ,",
    "@xmath57 is determined by the bottom of the sav .",
    "after we apply spectral smoothing to the off - source spectra , their variance is expected to be reduced to @xmath58 .",
    "because of inequality in variances of on- and off - source spectra , we need to re - design the best duty cycles of @xmath22 and @xmath23 under the condition where total telescope time is constant .",
    "let an on - to - off - source integration time ratio set to @xmath59 in each of the duty cycle and the total telescope time of @xmath60 .",
    "substituting @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and assuming that @xmath63 in equations [ eqn : sensitivity1 ] and [ eqn : sigma ] , we have @xmath64 the variance is minimized to @xmath65 when we have @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 for instance , the best ratio is @xmath68",
    ".    the interval between adjacent off - source scans should be shorter than the timescale of spectral stability in the receiving system .",
    "the spectral stability is evaluated by the time - based allan variance ( tav ) .",
    "as we ll see in figure [ fig : caledspec ] , a typical spectral shape of @xmath30 show an s - shaped feature with a peak and a bottom .",
    "since we focus on stability of the bandpass shape , the tav is calculated by the difference between levels of the peak and the bottom , i.e. @xmath69 .",

    "field tests have been carried out for the sbc to investigate how does it work efficiently .",
    "we used the vera @xcite iriki 20-m antenna in the single - dish mode .",
    "the antenna pointed to the zenith throughout our tests .",
    "the 22-ghz hemt receiver was tuned at 22.235 ghz with the bandwidth of 512 mhz .",
    "the received signal was downconverted with the first lo of 16.8 ghz , and the second lo of 5179 mhz before digitized at 1024 msps 2-bit quantization by the digital sampler ads-1000 @xcite .",
    "digital filtering was applied using the digital filter unit @xcite to split the signal into sixteen 16-mhz streams where we used only the first stream .",
    "spectroscopy was employed using the software spectrometer , vespa ( vera spectrum analyzer ; @xcite ) , that produces 1024 ch by 2048-point fft .",
    "this produces a squared sinc spectral resolution function whose first null appears at the adjacent ch , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "the template bandpass , @xmath29 , was obtained on 2010 apr .",
    "15 for 230-min integration .",
    "a 10-hour observation was conducted on 2010 oct . 5 , half - a - year later than acquiring the template bandpass to include seasonal variation .",
    "pseudo on  off scan pattern was produced from the 10-hour continuous observation ; off - source scans was pilfered from the continuous zenith observations .",
    "data quality was checked via monitoring the total power of every spectrum .",
    "the first 50-min data were not used because of unexpected operations of hot - load insertion .",
    "we also flagged out 3-sec data because of obviously irregular spectra probably due to data transmission error .",
    "finally , we obtained 32768-sec continuous spectra .",
    "for calculation of sav , we did not use the first spectral channel that includes direct current ( dc ) component affected by voltage bias offset at the digital sampler .    in this test",
    ", we set the target sd of the antenna temperature of @xmath76 mk , which is the standard of regular monitoring program in the vera iriki single - dish observations .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 for @xmath78 k.    we employed 3rd - order b - spline smoothing for off - source spectra in step 7 described in subsection [ subsec : strategy ] .",
    "node intervals are set to be equal to the smoothing window , @xmath73 .",
    "the statistical package r was used for data analyses of integration , bandpass calibration , av calculation , and b - spline smoothing .",
    "all of source codes for these procedures are presented in the github .",
    "the template bandpass , @xmath29 is shown in figure [ fig : bp ] .",
    "the sd of its random noise was @xmath79 , which was estimated by @xmath80 where @xmath81 was a b - spline - smoothed spectrum .",
    "we used @xmath81 for the following tests , though the sd was one order of magnitude smaller than the target noise level , to quest the ultimate performance .",
    "bandpass - corrected spectra , @xmath82 , are shown in figure [ fig : caledspec ] . here , @xmath83 is the mean value of the off - source spectra that represents @xmath6 .",
    "thus the bandpass - corrected spectrum indicates @xmath84 .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : caledspec ] was computed by the 3rd - order b - spline smoothing with the node intervals , @xmath67 and represent @xmath85 .",
    "departures from the solid line were dominated by the thermal noise , @xmath86 .",
    "the smoothed spectrum was time variable .",
    "its time variability is described in subsection [ subsec : timevariability ] .",
    "the savs of bandpass - corrected spectra defined as equation [ eqn : def_av ] are shown in figure [ fig : spactralav ] . at every frequency channel separation ,",
    "the sav decreased as was integrated for longer time .",
    "while the sav was decreasing as a function of frequency channel separation at shorter integration than 16 s , it appeared a local bottom and a top for longer integration than 16 s. they appeared at @xmath87 ch and @xmath88 ch , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : sav_fit ] shows the sav of a 64-min - integrated spectrum as an example .",
    "the profile was composed of two power - law components . for narrower channel separations than the bottom , the savs was dominated by a power - law profile with the index of @xmath89 .",
    "the index above the bottom was @xmath90 .",
    "the bottom of the sav appeared near the frequency span where the two power - law components were equivalent .",
    "at longer time integration , the bottom shifted towards narrower spectral separation in longer integration time , while the top stayed at almost the same separation .",
    "these behavior is summarized in table [ tab : spectralav ] .",
    "figure [ fig : spectralvariation ] displays variability of @xmath85 . the smoothed spectrum shows time variation in terms of not only the power level but also its shape such as slope , curvature , and local bumps .",
    "variation of the bandpass was evaluated by the standard deviation of the smoothed spectrum , @xmath91 , defined as @xmath92 .",
    "here , the expectation is taken by time average .",
    "figure [ fig : spectralsd ] shows the standard deviation of the smoothed spectrum .",
    "two clear peaks appeared at 71 ch and 920 ch , near the shoulders of the bandpass , @xmath29 .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath93% was significantly greater than the target accuracy of @xmath77 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to calibrate the bandpass using the smoothed off - source spectrum within the timescale while @xmath85 is stable enough .",
    "the timescale of stability was evaluated using the tav defined in equation [ eqn : def_time_av ] .",
    "since the top and bottom channels of the smoothed bandpass were also time variable , we instead used the twin peak channels in @xmath91 , i.e. we substituted @xmath94 .",
    "the tav is shown in figure [ fig : timeav ] .",
    "the first bottom of 30-sec - integrated spectrum appeared at 300 s. the power - law index of the tav was @xmath95 for @xmath96 s and was @xmath97 at @xmath98 , which we regulate as the spectral stability timescale in following processes .      basing on above results we set the new scan pattern and compared with the conventional on  off scans without spectral smoothing .",
    "the conventional pattern ( case 1 ) consists of pairs of 30-s on and 30-s off scans .",
    "the new scan pattern ( case 2 ) was a set of 70-s on and 10-s off with the sbc .",
    "the pattern was designed as the cycle period to be shorter than the spectral stability timescale of 80 s and the optimal on - to - off integration time ratio described in equation [ eqn : smoothed_sigma ] with @xmath67 .    to reach the targeted noise level of @xmath99 ,",
    "the conventional pattern required 20 sets ( 1200 s ) of the total telescope time .",
    "its resultant spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : resultspectra ] ( a1 ) . the case-2 spectrum with the telescope time of 1200 s ( 15 sets of 80-s scans ) is shown in figure [ fig : resultspectra ] ( c1 ) .",
    "the sd was @xmath100 ( median , minimum , and maximum of 27 samples ) , @xmath101 that of the conventional scan pattern . to achieve the targeted noise level , case 2 required 5 sets ( 400 s ) .",
    "its resultant spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : resultspectra ] ( b1 ) .    since the resultant spectrum appeared wiggled features other than random noise , we attempted baseline fitting and subtraction using the 3rd - order b - spline function with the node interval of 45 ch . after the baseline subtraction , the sds of cases 1 , 2 ( 1200 s ) , and 2 ( 400 s ) became @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively , and shown in figures [ fig : resultspectra ] ( a2 , c2 , and b2 ) .",
    "the performance of sd as functions of total telescope time is summarized in table [ tab : rms_integ ] and figure [ fig : residual_rms ] . at any total telescope time , the sbc exhibited better performance than conventional scans . while the sd of the conventional scans followed @xmath105 dependence , as was expected , the sbc resulted in a shallower slope with the power index of @xmath106 .",
    "the optimal spectral smoothing window , @xmath54 , was determined by the bottom in the sav listed in table [ tab : spectralav ] . for the timescale",
    "longer than 16 min , the bottom appeared at @xmath107 ch .",
    "we chose the window of 45 ch for time stability tests and spectral performance tests in previous subsections .",
    "we also tested the spectral performance with various windows of 2 , 3 , 4 , @xmath108 , 191 ch for the scan pattern of case 2 with the total telescope time of 400 and 1200 s.    figure [ fig : residual_sd ] shows the results .",
    "the median values of sds in the resultant spectrum before baseline subtraction recorded a minimum at the 64-ch window for both telescope times of 400 s and 1200 s. after baseline subtraction , the sd became significantly lower and the minimum appeared a flat bed for wider window than 45 ch . in all cases",
    "the bottom was smaller than the targeted noise level .",
    "as is shown in figure 1 , the sav across bandwidth is composed of the thermal noise and fluctuation of bandpass characteristics .",
    "the crossover point , where the thermal noise and the bandpass fluctuation is equivalent , appears at the bottom of the sav .",
    "relevant smoothing window , @xmath54 , should be set around the crossover point . for longer integration the bottom of sav shifts toward narrower channel separation .",
    "the regression of the crossover point indicates that the channel separation of the bottom relates to the integration time as @xmath109 for @xmath110 min .",
    "this behavior is explained as following consideration .",
    "the thermal noise component is stochastic which does not depend on time and frequency .",
    "thus the sav of thermal noise component @xmath111 .",
    "the bandpass fluctuation sav @xmath112 .",
    "this power - law index is slightly steeper than sav @xmath113 which is expected for a random - walk process along frequency .",
    "since the bandpass characteristics is frozen during short timescale , the sav of bandpass fluctuation is independent of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the crossover point appear under the condition of @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a proportional coefficient .",
    "thus , the sav bottom will appear at @xmath116 .",
    "the behavior of the test observation , which indicates @xmath109 , is consistent with the theoretical consideration .",
    "although a different combination of a receiving system and a spectrometer other than the vera system may have different properties of bandpass flatness , measuring savs at various integration time allows us to decompose it into thermal - noise and random - walk components .",
    "as shown in subsection 3.4 , the sbc ( case 2 ) allows us to shorten the total telscope time to @xmath2 to achieve the targeted noise level , compared with the conventional method ( case 1 ) . in other words ,",
    "the sbc reduces the sd by a factor of @xmath117 within the same total telescope time .",
    "these results demonstrate that the telescope time efficiency can be tripled by the sbc method with the optimal scan pattern .",
    "since our analysis did not take scan gaps time into consideration , the efficiency can be different in realistic observations .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : resultspectra ] , systematic undulation remains in the case-2 spectrum before baseline subtraction .",
    "the undulation can be ascribed to off - scan time interval of 70 s that may be longer than the stability timescale ( * see figure [ fig : timeav ] * ) .",
    "off - scan intervals should be shorter to reduce the undulation , however , this modification increases the time loss in scan gaps .",
    "optimal scan pattern should be tested in detail under realistic conditions of scan gaps and time stability .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : residual_rms ] , the slope of sd reduction by time integration for the sbc was shallower than that for conventional scans .",
    "the shallower slope indicates that the sbc underperforms at a long integration time .",
    "this underperformance can be caused by time instability of the bandpass .",
    "the power index of the tav of @xmath97 at @xmath98 s , with a small departure from @xmath118 , indicates that bandpass fluctuation remains with the level of @xmath119 ( * see figure [ fig : timeav ] * ) .",
    "this level of fluctuation is not tangible in the conventional scans even at the longest integration ( @xmath120 ) but can affect in the sbc ( @xmath121 )",
    ". the bandpass stability can be the principal component to determine the sensitivity at a longer integration time then 32400 s. to pursue the sensitivity at the longer integration , shorter scan pattern should be considered in spite of time loss in scan gaps .",
    "dual beam systems are equipped in some radio telescopes such as the gbt 100-m @xcite , the nobeyama 45-m @xcite , and the vera @xcite , to double the time efficiency by interchanging on- and off - source scans between two beams .",
    "the duty cycle for on and off scans in dual beam systems should be 1:1 ( or @xmath122 in equation [ eqn : min_sigma ] ) , if performance of two receivers is uniform , and different from the optimal duty cycle for the sbc . in this case the variance , @xmath123 , will be reduced by a factor of @xmath124 when we employ the sbc .",
    "taking @xmath67 for instance , the variance is reduced by the factor of @xmath125 and the telescope time efficiency is almost doubled , 3.9 times better than conventional on  off scans with a single beam system , or 1.3 times better than the sbc with a single beam system .",
    "consideration in this subsection implies that the sbc for single - beam with conventional on  off scans ( 1:1 duty cycles ) also doubles snr .",
    "re - analysis with the sbc for previous observations can offer an opportunity to enhance snr , if on- and off - source spectra are separately recorded , and the efficiency depends on the spectral stability of the system .      on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping shares the off - source pointing among a continuous scan pass .",
    "@xcite argued that the noise level achieved in the unit observing time of the otf map is written as @xmath126 and derived the optimal off - source integration time to map a rectangular area with the row span of @xmath127 was given @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the on - source scan time for a row by the scan speed of @xmath130 , @xmath131 is the overhead time between row scans , @xmath132 is the efficiency determined by the gridding convolution function , @xmath56 is the grid spacing , and @xmath133 is the number of row scans between off - source integrations . in the practical case of @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 s , and @xmath139 , according to @xcite , the on - source scan time of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 s yields @xmath143 , 12 , and 17 s , respectively .",
    "the optimization is modified when the sbc is applied .",
    "equation [ eqn : sawada2008 ] is modified as @xmath144 when the smoothing window is @xmath73 ch .",
    "the optimal off - source integration will be @xmath145 .",
    "for comparison to @xcite , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 s yields @xmath146 , 1.8 , and 2.5 s when we take @xmath67 , and the noise level decreases by factors of 0.886 , 0.874 , and 0.856 , respectively .",
    "thus , the total telescope time that achieves the same sd will be reduced by a factor of @xmath147 .",
    "the effect of the sbc is less than simple on - off scans , nevertheless , the sbc offers somewhat better results .",
    "consideration in this subsection does not involve bandpass fluctuation .",
    "more realistic optimization and noise level should be estimated basing on time - stability of receiving systems",
    ".      sbc yields weakness against unwanted spurious emissions such as rfi , contamination of sampling clocks and reference signals in a receiving system , artificial pattern caused by numerical errors of spectral calculation , etc .",
    "these spurious signals usually show spiky features in both on- and off - scan spectra .",
    "they are suppressed in the smoothed off - scan spectra while kept in the unsmoothed on - scan spectra .",
    "thus they will appear in the final results , though they would be subtracted by the conventional on - off scans if they were stable .    in our test observations",
    ", spurious emissions appeared at 704 ch and 832 ch ( see figure [ fig : resultspectra ] ) that correspond to 11/16 and 13/16 of the bandwidth .",
    "their line width is narrower than the spectral resolution .",
    "digital noise such as harmonics of the sampling clock can cause such spurious emissions whose frequencies are simple fractions of the bandwidth .",
    "these spurious frequencies should be masked in spectral data reduction .",
    "observers need to pay deeper attention to spurious when they apply sbc .",
    "it is presented that the proposed sbc method offers significantly better performance than conventional on  off scans , especially when a stable spectrometer such as digital system was equipped .",
    "our tests showed that the total telescope time was reduced to @xmath2 to attain the same snr , or @xmath148 better snr was obtained in the same telescope time for a single - pointing on - off scans .",
    "the sbc method was also efficient for dual - beam systems , on - the - fly mapping .      * long - time integrated bandpass to obtain good - enough @xmath29 .",
    "this can be done in off seasons . *",

    "<S> we have tested the sbc using the digital spectrometer , vespa , on the vera iriki station . for the targeted noise level of @xmath0 as a ratio to the system noise , the optimal smoothing window was 32  60 channels ( ch ) in the whole bandwidth of 1024 ch , and the optimal scan pattern was designed as a sequence of 70-s on + 10-s off scan pairs . the noise level with the sbc </S>",

    "<S> the sbc was 400 s , which was @xmath2 of 1200 s required by the conventional way . </S>",
    "<S> improvement in telescope time efficiency with the sbc was calculated as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for single - beam , dual - beam , and on - the - fly ( otf ) scans , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sbc works to optimize scan patterns for observations from now , and also works to improve signal - to - noise ratios of archival data if on- and off - source spectra are individually recorded , though the efficiency depends on the spectral stability of the receiving system . </S>"
