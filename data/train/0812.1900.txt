    "much current research in optical device physics is focused on bistable , switchable semiconductor lasing elements .",
    "the aim is to provide sophisticated functions for all - optical signal processing , including optical memory , flip - flop or optical logic [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the systems considered comprise single @xcite or coupled @xcite devices including micro - cavity lasers @xcite , edge - emitting devices @xcite and vcsels [ 8 - 10 ] .",
    "although laser diodes are known to exhibit complex dynamical features , they are nevertheless successfully modeled by surprisingly low - dimensional and generic systems of equations .",
    "laser diodes therefore provide model systems for the understanding of fundamental concepts of nonlinear dynamics , such as non - invasive chaos control @xcite or synchronisation of coupled chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "switching between co - existing states of bistable semiconductor laser devices can be achieved using modulated or pulsed optical injection .",

    "semiconductor lasers with optical injection are well understood .",
    "for a recent review see reference @xcite . while two - mode models have successfully explained the switching between single mode states with different polarizations in vcsels @xcite , a general understanding of nonlinear dynamical phenomena in laser diodes for the case of more than one simultaneously active mode is still lacking . in edge - emitting lasers",
    "a reason for this is that plain edge - emitting fabry - prot ( fp ) laser diodes will generally operate with many longitudinal modes close to threshold , which complicates the interpretation and modeling of experimental results considerably @xcite .    using an inverse problem solution @xcite , which relates the threshold gain modulation in wavenumber space to the spatially varying refractive index in a fp laser , we have designed a two - color fp laser diode with thz primary mode spacing .",
    "the large engineered mode spacing of this two - color device leads to weakly coupled modes with the result that the bias current can be adjusted so that the two primary modes oscillate simultaneously with the same average power level . with only two active modes ,",
    "such a device represents a test - bed for the systematic study of the nonlinear dynamics of multiwavelength semiconductor lasers .    in this paper , we examine the locking bistability of the two - color device with optical injection .",
    "in contrast to the case of a single mode laser , where a bistability is found between a stable limit cycle associated with wave mixing and the injection locked state @xcite , we demonstrate that in the two - color laser a bistability between the injection locked ( single mode ) state and a two - color steady state is possible .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate all - optical switching between these bistable states , where the uninjected mode of the device performs an inverted memory function with greater than 35 db intensity contrast .",
    "we explain the underlying mechanism using modeling and bifurcation analysis , showing that a four - dimensional model of the system provides excellent agreement with experimental results .",
    "our results demonstrate a new and unique approach to in - plane all - optical signal processing .",

    "[ opex3 ] .",
    "one can see that the device operates as a memory element where we can regard the mode at short wavelength as performing the ( inverted ) memory function and the injected mode at long wavelength as the writing channel .",

    "this ratio between the cross and self saturation is consistent with the stability of the two - mode solution in the free running laser @xcite .",
    "note that although we have provided a complex equation for the field @xmath33 , the phase of @xmath33 is in fact decoupled leading to a four - dimensional system of equations .",
    "only the intensity of the uninjected mode influences the dynamics , reflecting the fact that the mode spacing is in the highly non - degenerate regime .",
    "more generally , our model describes two oscillators , whose amplitudes are coupled via a global variable @xmath19 , and where one of the oscillators is forced by a periodic external input .    using the model equations ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] )",

    "as @xmath25 increases from zero , the stable two mode limit cycle associated with @xmath37 which exists for small @xmath25 evolves into a stable two mode equilibrium via a supercritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath38 . with increasing @xmath25",

    "[ opex4 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "bistability therefore occurs if the @xmath40 bifurcation occurs at a smaller @xmath25 value than the @xmath41 bifurcation , which is the case for sufficiently negative detuning ( @xmath42ghz ) as evident from fig.[opex4 ] ( c ) .",

    "[ opex2 ] .",
    "finally , the lower end of the bistable region @xmath51 in fig . [ opex2 ] can be identified with the saddle - node bifurcation @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ opex4 ] . when approaching this bifurcation with decreasing @xmath25 , no precursor oscillations are observed , as saddle - node bifurcations do not generically involve oscillatory behaviour .",
    "all of the above conclusions are confirmed by numerical simulations that include spontaneous emission noise .",
    "it is interesting to compare this bifurcation structure with others considered in the literature . in @xcite a bistability between a limit cycle and a locked state was reported in optically injected single mode lasers .",
    "this limit cycle becomes unstable via a subcritical torus bifurcation .",
    "in contrast , our bistability mechanism involves only hopf and saddle - node bifurcations and occurs between two equilibria .",
    "the relative simplicity of our bifurcation scenario is therefore a result of the presence of the second lasing mode , and the increase of the dimensionality of the dynamical system by one .",
    "a pair of subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations have also been associated with relaxation - oscillation and wave - mixing pulsations in the context of in - plane semiconductor lasers with integrated optical feedback @xcite where similar precursor features close to the bifurcation points were also reported .",
    "the bifurcations of a two - mode system have also been studied in the context of optically injected vcsels to explain the switching between single - mode states with different polarizations @xcite . however , since the two polarization modes in a vcsel have a very small frequency spacing ( c.  10 ghz ) , these polarization modes are intrinsically bistable , and a six dimensional system of equations is required for adequate modeling . as a result the bifurcation scenario differs significantly from that considered here , which involves an equilibrium state with two simultaneously active and highly nondegenerate lasing modes .",
    "we note also that the case of two - mode injection locking in an optically injected vcsel @xcite must also be contrasted with our case , as injection locking implies a frequency degeneracy between the orthogonally polarized modes and the injected field .",
    "such a state , which can be regarded as a single mode state with elliptical polarization , can not arise in the context of our model as the phase of the uninjected mode is decoupled .    in fig .",
    "[ opex5 ] we show the results of numerical modeling of the optical memory element . for this simulation",
    "we have used a 5 ns pulse duration and we also included spontaneous emission noise .",
    "agreement with the measured intensity time traces is very good .",
    "in particular , we have reproduced the large and decaying relaxation oscillations in the injected mode s unlocking dynamics .",
    "the fast locking of the injected mode and the fast extinction of the uninjected mode is also reproduced as is the rather slower recovery of the uninjected mode once the injected mode unlocks .",
    "numerical results suggest that the memory element can be switched between states with subnanosecond pulses .",
    "numerical intensity time traces of the injected field strength and of the two primary modes of the device .",
    "the detuning is -14 ghz .",
    "the average value of the injected field strength is 0.018 with a modulation of @xmath52 0.008 .",
    "the pulses are 5 ns duration with a 200 ps rise - time . ]",
    "we have demonstrated an all - optical memory element based on the injection locking of a two - color fabry - prot laser diode .",
    "pulsed modulation of the injected field leads to switching of the uninjected mode with 35 db intensity contrast .",
    "the underlying bistability in the system was found to be between the single mode injection locked state and a two - color equilibrium state , unlike in the single mode injected laser .",
