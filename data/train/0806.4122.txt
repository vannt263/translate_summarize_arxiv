    "such feedback processes sometimes trigger or regulate nearby star - formation activity .",
    "their thermal and kinetic effects are important factors in the phase cycle of the interstellar medium .",
    "strong coherent feedback by many massive stars causes galactic - scale dynamical phenomena , such as galactic winds .",
    "furthermore , massive stars dominate the light from distant galaxies .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate is mostly estimated with the light observed from massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite such importance , the question of the formation process of massive stars still remains open .",
    "as for lower - mass stars , there is a widely - accepted formation scenario , where gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores leads to subsequent mass accretion onto tiny protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if one directly applies this scenario to massive star formation , however , some difficulties arise in the main accretion phase ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "the main difficulty in the formation of massive stars is the very strong radiation pressure acting on a dusty envelope .",
    "the radiative repulsive effect becomes quite strong at the dust destruction front , where the accretion flow gets much of the outward momentum of radiation .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for massive star formation is to overcome this barrier at the dust destruction front .",
    "however , some theoretical work has shown that the accretion rate of @xmath1 expected of lower - mass protostars is too low to overcome the barrier ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wc87 ) .",
    "because of this difficulty , various scenarios different from the standard accretion paradigm have been proposed such as stellar mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and competitive accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an origin of this disputed situation is uncertainty concerning the initial condition for massive star formation .",
    "this uncertainty partly originates from the scarcity of massive stars ; most of the massive star forming regions are distant .",
    "in addition , the initial condition is easily disrupted by feedback from newly formed massive stars .",
    "since the accretion rate reflects the thermal state of the original molecular core , it is still uncertain which rates should be favored for growing high - mass protostars .",
    "in fact , some observations of young high - mass sources suggest high accretion rates . signatures of infall motion are detected with various line observations toward high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) and hyper-/ultra - compact h  ii regions , and the derived accretion rates are @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "detailed modeling of such protostars should be useful for future high - resolution observations and simulations of massive star formation . however , previous studies on such protostars are fairly limited .",
    "the protostellar evolution has been well studied for low - mass ( @xmath14 ) and intermediate - mass ( @xmath15 ) protostars by detailed numerical calculations solving the stellar structure , but these studies have focused on evolution at the low accretion rate of @xmath16 ( e.g. , stahler , shu & taam 1980a , b , hereafter sst80a , b ; palla & stahler 1990 , 1991 , hereafter ps91 , 1992 ; beech & mitalas 1994 ) maeder and coworkers have calculated the protostellar evolution under accretion rates growing with the stellar mass , which finally exceeds @xmath12 @xcite , but it is still uncertain how the evolution changes with accretion rates , and which physical mechanisms cause differences .",
    "some authors have used polytropic one - zone models originally invented for low accretion rates even at such a high rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ [ adiabatic - accretion - phase ] ] adiabatic accretion phase + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    upper panels of figure [ fig : slpf_1em3 ] present the evolution of entropy profile within the protostar .",
    "this shows that the entropy profiles at different epochs completely overlap : at a fixed mass element , the specific entropy remains constant .",
    "the entropy is originally generated at the accretion shock front , and embedded into the stellar interior .",
    "thus , during this earliest phase , the entropy profile inside the star just traces the history of entropy at the post - shock point . owing to a high value of opacity ,",
    "radiative heat transport is inefficient in the interior of the protostar .",
    "this makes the interior luminosity small , then @xmath56 in this phase ( see fig .  [",

    "although a significant entropy loss occurs in this luminosity spike as indicated by the relation @xmath58 ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ene ] ) ) , this layer is extremely thin and the time for a mass element to pass though it is so short that the entropy hardly changes .",
    "this can be confirmed by comparing the two timescales ; the local accretion time @xmath59 and local cooling time @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the depth ( in mass coordinate ) of a mass shell from the accretion shock , and @xmath62 denotes arbitrary small entropy change .",
    "the former , @xmath63 , is the time for a thin shell of mass @xmath64 at the surface to be replaced by the newly accreted material , while the latter , @xmath65 , is the time for the same shell to lose the entropy @xmath66 by outward radiation .",
    "comparison between these timescales in the settling layer is presented in figure [ fig : t_comp_1em3 ] . where @xmath67 is adopted for numerical evaluation .",

    "sps86 have derived the mass - radius relation for protostars in the adiabatic accretion phase ; @xmath76 under the condition that opacity in the radiative precursor is dominated by h@xmath77 bound - free absorption .",
    "as this condition holds in our case , our calculated mass - radius relation is in a good agreement with equation ( [ eq : r_sps86 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : r_sps86 ] ) suggests the large radius ( @xmath78 ) of the rapidly - accreting protostar .",
    "the interior of the protostar remains radiative throughout this phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em3 ] , upper panel ) : all the energy transport is via radiation .",
    "this is in high contrast with low @xmath79 ( @xmath16 ) cases , where most of the interior becomes convective owing to deuterium burning for @xmath80 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] below ) .",
    "this can be attributed to a difference in the interior temperature . from equation ( [ eq : typ_rhop ] ) ,",
    "typical temperature within the star is @xmath81 therefore , the large stellar radius leads to the low temperature in the stellar interior .",
    "in fact , the maximum temperature in this phase does not exceed the threshold for deuterium burning ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em3 ] ) .",
    "once the accreted matter has passed through the outermost layer with the luminosity spike , the luminosity gradient becomes much milder .",
    "the luminosity has a maximum at some radius : outside the luminosity maximum , the gradient @xmath82 , while @xmath83 inside .",
    "this means that heat is removed from the deep interior and absorbed in the outer layer .",
    "this entropy transfer , however , remains small and does not modify the entropy distribution significantly during this phase .",
    "efficiency of the outward entropy transfer is related to the value of opacity . in most of the stellar interior ,",
    "major sources of opacity are bound - bound and bound - free transitions of heavy elements , which approximately obey kramers law , @xmath84 @xcite . with the increase in stellar mass and",
    "then the interior temperature , the opacity decreases .",
    "this results in steady increase of the outward heat flux with evolution .",
    "in fact , as shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig : slpf_1em3 ] , the amplitude of the luminosity increases with the growth of the protostar .",
    "also the maximum luminosity within the star @xmath85 increases as a power - law function of @xmath69 as seen in the middle panel of figure [ fig : lum_enuc_tsc_1em3 ] .",
    "this dependence can be understood as follows : for a star with radiative stratification and kramers opacity , the luminosity scales as @xmath86 ( e.g. , cox & giuli 1968 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that @xmath85 roughly obeys , @xmath87 in our calculations . using equations ( [ eq : r_sps86 ] ) and ( [ eq : l_max_a ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath88 for a constant accretion rate .",
    "when opacity becomes sufficiently small , the radiative heat transport becomes significant even in the deep interior .",
    "consequently , the entropy distribution and thus stellar structure are drastically altered , which leads to the subsequent swelling phase .",

    "the stellar radius suddenly increases by a factor of about three and eventually exceeds @xmath3 .",
    "this swelling is caused by redistribution of entropy within the star .",
    "as explained above , the outward heat flow continues to increase , and ceases to be negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : slpf_1em3 ] shows that the entropy distribution changes significantly with time , i.e. , with @xmath69 : the entropy decreases in the deep interior , and increases in the outer layer .",
    "the extent of the inner entropy - losing region becomes larger and larger , and approaches the surface , as more of the interior becomes less opaque .",
    "as seen in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : slpf_1em3 ] , the peak of the luminosity , which is the boundary between the entropy - losing interior and the outer absorbing layer , gradually moves toward the surface with increasing height .",
    "this outward propagation of the luminosity peak is called the luminosity wave ( sps86 ) .",
    "only a thin outlying layer absorbs the entropy transported from the deep interior .",
    "this rapid increase of the entropy near the surface causes swelling of the radius .",
    "actually , only a small fraction of mass near the surface contributes to this swelling .",
    "for example , at the maximum expansion of the radius @xmath90 at @xmath91 , only 0.03% of the total mass is contained in the outer layers of @xmath92 .",
    "note that the swelling is not due to the shell burning of deuterium .",
    "@xcite have presented that a similar swelling occuring in intermediate - mass protostars at the low accretion rate of @xmath93 , and concluded that this is caused by the shell burning of deuterium . in our case , however , deuterium burning is not important for the swelling . even in the run without deuterium burning ( md3-nod ) ,",
    "the swelling is caused by redistribution of entropy in the same fashion ( also see ",

    "also a thin convective layer near the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em3 ] ) is not brought about by the deuterium burning .",

    "the region in the accreting envelope with temperature @xmath111k becomes optically thick .",
    "thus , the photospheric temperature @xmath112 remains at @xmath113k throughout the evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prec_1em3 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "since the photospheric radius is related to the total luminosity by @xmath114 for the constant @xmath112 , the rapid increase in the luminosity in the contraction phase causes the expansion of the photosphere .",
    "next , we revisit the evolution of an accreting protostar under the lower accretion rate of @xmath93 ( run md5 ) . although this case has been extensively studied by previous authors , a brief presentation should be helpful to underline the effects of different accretion rates on protostellar evolution .",

    "see appendix  [ ap : prev ] .",
    "the lower accretion rate means the longer accretion timescale @xmath115 : even at the same protostellar mass @xmath69 , the evolutionary timescale is longer in the case of low @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the protostar has ample time to lose heat before gaining more mass .",
    "this results in the lower entropy and thus a smaller radius at the same protostellar mass in the low @xmath79 case as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] .",
    "although with the smaller value , the overall evolutionary features of the high and low @xmath79 radii are similar .",
    "again , the protostellar evolution can be divided into four characteristic stages , i.e. , ( i ) convection ( @xmath116 ) , ( ii ) swelling ( @xmath117 ) , ( iii ) kh contraction ( @xmath118 ) , and ( iv ) main - sequence accretion ( @xmath119 ) phases .",
    "note that the first phase is now the convection phase instead of the adiabatic accretion . in the low @xmath79 case ,",
    "the deuterium burning drastically affects the protostellar evolution in early phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the temperature , as well as density , is higher in the low @xmath79 case ( cf .",
    "lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] ) .",
    "the maximum temperature reaches @xmath120  k as early as @xmath121 and active deuterium burning begins subsequently ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] ) , while in the high-@xmath79 case the d ignition does not occur until @xmath122 ( fig .  [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em3 ] ) .",
    "unlike in the high-@xmath79 case , the deuterium burning makes most of the interior convective .",
    "this is a result of high density and thus high opacity at the ignition of deuterium burning , occurring at a fixed temperature of @xmath123 k. since high opacity hinders the radiative heat transport , entropy generated by deuterium burning can not be transported radiatively .",
    "this necessarily gives rise to convection .",
    "figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] shows that the extent of the convective layers experiences a complicated history . at @xmath124 ,",
    "a convective layer appears for the first time slightly off - center .",
    "inside the convective layer , entropy is homogenized and its value increases owing to the d burning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slpf_1em5 ] , i ) . with this increased entropy",
    ", the outer layer is gradually incorporated into the convective region .",
    "fresh deuterium is supplied from the newly incorporated layer and spreads over the convective region , and finally is consumed by nuclear burning at the bottom of the region .",
    "however , the expansion of the convective region can not be maintained if the supply of deuterium becomes insufficient . without the fuel , the deuterium concentration in the convective region @xmath125 drops and",
    "the nuclear burning ceases : the convective region disappears .",
    "this occurs at @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] , upper ) . at @xmath127 , another episode of",
    "deuterium burning begins just outside the first convective region , where fresh deuterium still remains .",
    "the second convective region develops there and immediately reaches the stellar surface .",
    "although this complicated evolution of the convective regions is different from that reported in sst80b , this difference can be attributable to high sensitivity of the evolution on adopted initial deuterium abundance .",
    "we discuss this in greater details in appendix  [ ssec : dab ] .",
    "since the energy generation by d burning is very sensitive to the temperature , temperature remains constant at @xmath128k during the active deuterium burning ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "this is the so - called thermostat effect ( e.g. , stahler 1988 ) .",
    "if this works , @xmath129 from equation ( [ eq : t_typ ] ) : the protostellar radius @xmath70 increases as @xmath130 .",
    "this linear increase in @xmath70 with @xmath69 can be observed in the range @xmath131 ( fig .  [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "when the deuterium concentration in the convective region drops to a few percent , the thermostat effect ceases to work .",
    "the maximum temperature starts increasing again and the radial expansion slows down after that . owing to the high temperature , opacity decreases in the deep interior with increasing stellar mass .",
    "this allows efficient radiative energy transport and renders a large portion of the interior radiative .",
    "the radiative core gradually extends to the outer layer , and the convective layer moves outward . since",
    "fresh deuterium is no longer supplied to the radiative interior by the mixing , deuterium is soon exhausted there .",
    "the expansion of the radiative interior occurs in a later phase in the calculation of ps91 .",
    "this difference can be attributed to different initial models : whereas ps91 assumed a fully convective star of @xmath132 as an initial model , we started calculation from the initial mass @xmath133 . at @xmath134 ,",
    "the protostar is not fully convective in our case .",
    "the outer layers of @xmath135 are convective , where the d burning occurs at the bottom , while the remaining inner core is radiative at this moment .",
    "we confirmed that , starting from the same initial model , the evolution becomes similar to that of ps91 as discussed in appendix [ ssec : psini ] .",
    "because of the early ignition of deuterium burning , entropy and luminosity profiles in this phase look rather different from those in the high @xmath79 case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slpf_1em3 ] and [ fig : slpf_1em5 ] ) . for easier comparison ,",
    "let us see the case without deuterium burning , where the similar profiles are in fact reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slpf_1em5_nod ] ) . however , one important difference exists , the spiky structure in the entropy profiles near the surface .",
    "this shows significant entropy loss near the surface in the low @xmath79 case , which leads to the low entropy within the star . the reason can be seen clearly in figure [ fig : t_comp_1em5 ] , where the comparison between the local accretion timescale @xmath68 and cooling timescale @xmath136 ( eq.s [ eq : taccs ] and [ eq : tcools ] ) is presented .",
    "in contrast to the the case of high @xmath79 , in most of the settling layer , @xmath68 is shorter than @xmath136 : accreted matter loses entropy radiatively near the surface before settling into the adiabatic interior .

    "[ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] , upper ) .",
    "although deuterium burning continues near the surface , it does not drive convection any more .    the cause of this",
    "swelling has been attributed to the shell burning of deuterium , which also occurs in our calculation ( palla & stahler 1990 ) .",
    "however , we conclude that the main driver of the swelling is not the d shell burning , but the outward entropy transportation as in the case of the high accretion rate .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , evolutionary features of entropy and luminosity profiles in this phase are similar to those in the swelling phase in the high @xmath79 case ( run md3 ; cf .",
    "figs.[fig : slpf_1em3 ] , [ fig : slpf_1em5 ] ) : in both cases , entropy decreases in the deep interior and increases significantly near the stellar surface ; simultaneously , the peak of the luminosity distribution moves to the surface as the luminosity wave .",
    "second , even in the run without deuterium burning ( run md5-nod ) , this swelling occurs as shown in figure [ fig : str_1em5_nod ] : the protostar swells up at @xmath137 .",
    "the interior luminosity @xmath42 jumps up at @xmath127 with the arrival of the convective region at the surface as a result of high efficiency of convective heat transfer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_enuc_tsc_1em5 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "although this rise in @xmath42 decreases @xmath45 , @xmath45 remains much longer than @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_enuc_tsc_1em5 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "it is not until another sudden rise in @xmath42 at @xmath138 due to the arrival of the luminosity wave that @xmath45 becomes as short as @xmath46 .",
    "the maximum radius is attained at this epoch since the swelling is also caused by the luminosity wave , as seen above .",
    "then , the analytical argument leading to equation ( [ eq : m_rmax ] ) also holds in this case : for @xmath93 , this leads to the maximum radius at @xmath139 , which agrees with our numerical result .",
    "simultaneous returning to the radiative structure with the swelling has been explained by @xcite .",
    "the luminosity from the steady deuterium burning is comparable to the accretion luminosity by chance : @xmath140 the epoch of the radial turn - around obeys equation ( [ eq : m_rmax ] ) , which is derived by equating @xmath46 and @xmath141 .",
    "this means that @xmath85 becomes comparable to @xmath142 and thus to @xmath143 in the swelling phase .",
    "hence , the radiative luminosity now has a capacity to transport the energy generated by deuterium burning : @xmath144 .",
    "the deuterium burning no longer gives rise to any convective layer after the swelling .",
    "[ [ later - phases ] ] later phases + + + + + + + + + + + +    subsequently , the protostar enters the kh contraction phase .",
    "the evolution thereafter is similar to the previous high-@xmath79 case .",

    "the radiative precursor disappears thereafter . without the precursor ,",
    "the stellar surface is directly visible , with effective temperature rising remarkably in the kh contraction phase , i.e. , for @xmath148 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case of high accretion rate @xmath19 , where the effective temperature remains several thousand k throughout the evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prec_1em3 ] ) .      here , we summarize the effects of the different accretion rates on the protostellar evolution .",
    "the mass - radius relations of protostars with accretion rates @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 are shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : m_rtmax ] .    first , the protostellar radius is larger for the higher accretion rate at the same protostellar mass , as discussed in   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] .",

    "the mass - radius relations in the no - deuterium cases are also shown by thin lines in figure [ fig : m_rtmax ] .",
    "the deuterium burning enhances the stellar radius , in particular , in low @xmath79 cases ( see in this section below ) .",
    "nevertheless , the trend of larger @xmath70 for higher @xmath79 remains valid even without the deuterium burning . for simplicity",
    ", we do not include the effect of deuterium burning in the following argument .",
    "the origin of this trend is higher specific entropy for higher accretion rate .",
    "recall that the stellar radius is larger with the high entropy in the stellar interior as shown by equation ( [ eq : r_srel ] ) .",
    "the entropy distributions at @xmath153 for the no - d runs are shown in figure [ fig : s_1msun_nod ] , which indeed demonstrates that the entropy is higher for the higher @xmath79 cases .",
    "the interior entropy is set in the post - shock settling layer where radiative cooling can reduce the entropy from the initial post - shock value as observed in spiky structures near the surface ( e.g. , the case of @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_1msun_nod ] ) . for efficient radiative cooling ,",
    "the local cooling time @xmath65 in the settling layer must be shorter than the local accretion time @xmath68 , as explained in ",
    "[ ssec : md_1em3 ] and [ ssec : md_1em5 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : r_tcl_tacc ] shows that the ratio @xmath158 is smaller for lower @xmath79 and becomes less than unity for @xmath159 .",
    "thus the accreted gas cools radiatively in the settling layer in low @xmath79 ( @xmath160 ) cases , while in the higher @xmath79 cases , the gas is embedded into the stellar interior without losing the post - shock entropy .",
    "the difference in entropy among high @xmath79 ( @xmath161 ) cases comes from the higher post - shock entropy for higher @xmath79 . in those cases ,",
    "the protostar is enshrouded with the radiative precursor , whose optical depth is larger for the higher accretion rate ( c.f.,figs.[fig : prec_1em3 ] and [ fig : prec_1em5 ] , bottom ) . consequently",
    ", more heat is trapped in the precursor , which leads to the higher post - shock entropy .",
    "figure [ fig : m_rtmax ] shows not only that not only the swelling of the stellar radius occurs even in the `` no - d '' runs , but also that their timings are almost the same as in the cases with d. this supports our view that the cause of the swelling is outward entropy transport by the luminosity wave rather than the deuterium shell - burning (   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] and [ ssec : md_1em5 ] ) .",
    "also , in all cases , the epoch of the swelling obeys equation ( [ eq : m_rmax ] ) , which is derived by equating the accretion time @xmath46 and the kh time @xmath162 .",
    "another clear tendency is that the deuterium burning begins at higher stellar mass for higher accretion rate .",
    "similarly , the onset of hydrogen burning and subsequent arrival at the zams are postponed until higher protostellar mass for the higher accretion rate . for example , the zams arrival is at @xmath163 ( 40@xmath164 ) for @xmath165 ( @xmath17 , respectively ) @xmath166 .",
    "these delayed nuclear ignitions reflect the lower temperature within the protostar for the higher @xmath79 at the same @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m_rtmax ] , lower panel ) .",
    "since @xmath70 is larger with higher @xmath79 at a given @xmath69 , typical temperature is lower within the star . substituting numerical values in equation ( [ eq : t_typ ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath167 which is a good approximation for our numerical results .",
    "finally , we consider the significance of deuterium burning for protostellar evolution . comparing with `` no - d '' runs , we find that the effect of deuterium burning not only appears later , but also becomes weaker with increasing accretion rates . at the low accretion rates",
    "@xmath168 , convection spreads into a wide portion of the star owing to the vigorous deuterium burning .",
    "in addition , the thermostat effect works and the stellar radius increases linearly during this period . at the higher accretion rates @xmath13 , on the other hand , deuterium burning affects the protostellar evolution only slightly .",
    "convective regions do not appear even after the beginning of deuterium burning for @xmath169 (   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] ) .    a key quantity for understanding this variation is the maximum radiative luminosity at the ignition of deuterium burning .",
    "the maximum radiative luminosity within the star @xmath85 at deuterium ignition can be evaluated by eliminating @xmath70 and @xmath69 in equation ( [ eq : l_max_a ] ) with ( [ eq : r_sps86 ] ) , ( [ eq : t_max_aly ] ) , and setting @xmath170  k : @xmath171 on the other hand , the luminosity from deuterium burning is ( eq . [ eq : l_dst ] ) @xmath172 .",
    "for accretion rate @xmath37 , @xmath173 : radiation is able to carry away all the entropy generated by the deuterium burning .",
    "therefore , the protostellar interior remains radiative in the high @xmath79 cases ( e.g. , run md3 , see   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] ) , while convection is excited for the lower @xmath79 ( e.g. , run md5 , see   [ ssec : md_1em5 ] ) .",
    "besides the massive star formation in the local universe , high accretion rates have been invoked in the primordial star formation in the early universe . without important metal coolants ,",
    "the temperature remains at several hundred k in the primordial gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the mass - radius relations for the primordial ( @xmath178 ) protostars are presented in figure [ fig : m_r_z ] , along with their solar - metallicity ( @xmath179 ) counterparts for comparison .",
    "this indicates that basic evolutionary features are similar despite differences in metallicity : as in the present - day protostars , primordial protostars pass through the same four characteristic phases ( see   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] and [ ssec : md_1em5 ] ) .",
    "the following two differences , however , still exist .",
    "first , the swelling of the protostar and subsequent transition to the kh contraction occur earlier in the @xmath178 cases . for example , for @xmath180 ,",
    "the maximum radius is attained and the kh contraction begins at @xmath181 in the @xmath179 case , while it is @xmath182 in the @xmath178 case . recall that the transition to those phases is caused by the decrease in opacity with increasing @xmath69 (   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] ) .",
    "owing to the lack of heavy elements , the opacity is lower in the primordial gas at the same density and temperature .",
    "efficient radiative heat transport begins earlier , which results in the earlier transitions in the evolutionary phases .",
    "second , the stellar radius in the main - sequence phase is smaller as a result of higher interior temperature ( @xmath183k ) for the primordial stars . due to the lack of c and n , sufficient energy production by the cn cycle is not available at a temperature similar to that of the solar metallicity case ( @xmath184k ) .",
    "the kh contraction is not halted until the temperature reaches @xmath183k , where a small amount of carbon produced by the he burning enables the operation of the cn cycle @xcite .",
    "since more contraction is needed , the arrival at the zams can be later in the @xmath178 case , despite the earlier beginning of the kh contraction : for example , it is @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) in the @xmath187 ( @xmath178 , respectively ) case .      the higher the mass accretion rate , the more massive the protostar grows before the arrival at the zams phase (   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] and [ ssec : md_dep ] ) .",
    "however , this trend does not continue unlimitedly : for a rate exceeding a threshold value , stars have an upper mass limit set by the radiation pressure onto the radiative precursor .",
    "the evolution of the protostellar radius is shown in figure [ fig : m_r_blowup ] ( upper panel ) for cases with very high accretion rates @xmath188 . up to a certain moment in the kh contraction phase",
    ", the evolution in all cases proceeds in a qualitatively similar way although the radius is larger and the onset of swelling and the kh contraction are later for higher @xmath79 cases .",
    "however , for accretion rates @xmath189 , the contraction is halted at @xmath190 , followed by abrupt expansion at @xmath191 . in such cases , further steady accretion onto the star",
    "is not possible owing to strong radiative pressure exerted onto the radiative precursor .",
    "this phenomenon has been found for the primordial star formation by @xcite .",
    "they found that abrupt expansion occurs when the total luminosity from a protostar , @xmath192 , becomes close to the eddington luminosity @xmath193 .",
    "the strong radiation pressure decelerates the accretion flow and then reduces the ram pressure onto the stellar surface . with reduced inward ram pressure , an outward thrust by the interior radiation blows a thin surface layer away .    the critical accretion rate @xmath194 is defined as the rate above which the abrupt stellar expansion occurs in the kh contraction phase . by using the condition that @xmath195 reaches @xmath193 before the protostar reaches the zams , @xcite derived the critical rate as follows : @xmath196 that is , @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the electron - scattering opacity , and the suffix `` zams '' means quantities of the zams stars . although the critical rate @xmath199 by equation ( [ eq : mcr_pm ] ) depends on the stellar mass , the dependence is very weak and @xmath200 for the primordial stars . since the zams radius increases with metallicity ( see   [ ssec : metal ] ) , @xmath199 is expected to increase with metallicity . for example",
    ", for @xmath201 , @xmath202 by equation ( [ eq : mcr_pm ] ) , and the evolutionary calculation demonstrated that abrupt stellar expansion occurs in fact for higher accretion rates @xcite .",
    "our calculations , however , indicate that the critical accretion rate in the solar metallicity case is @xmath203 , slightly smaller than that of primordial protostars .",
    "this apparent contradiction comes from the fact that , in the solar metallicity case , opacity in the accreting envelope is higher than that of the electron scattering one @xmath204 postulated in the above derivation for the critical accretion rate .",
    "in fact , the violent stellar expansion is found to take place with a total luminosity of about a half of the eddington luminosity , as shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : m_r_blowup ] .",
    "a marginal case is run md3x3 , where the contraction is about to be reversed , but the star barely reaches the zams after some loitering . in this case , the eddington ratio @xmath205 slightly exceeds 0.5 at @xmath206 . for comparison , the case of the primordial star is shown for the same accretion rate , @xmath207 , which is slightly lower than the critical accretion rate ( run md3x3-z0 ) . because of the earlier transition to the kh contraction phase , the eddington ratio also begins to increase earlier than the present - day counterpart ( run md3x3 ) . despite high luminosity almost reaching the eddington limit ,",
    "the kh contraction is not reversed and the protostar can grow further . taking into account the higher opacity in the envelope , we add the eddington factor of @xmath208 to equation ( [ eq : lcr_pm ] ) : @xmath209 for present - day protostars .",
    "the critical accretion rate becomes @xmath210 , which agrees well with our numerical results .",
    "although this critical rate is a function of the stellar mass , its dependence is weak as in the primordial case .",
    "our results suggest an upper mass limit of pms stars at @xmath211 , which corresponds to the mass where the protostar reaches the zams at the critical accretion rate of @xmath212 .",
    "more massive pms stars can not be formed by steady mass accretion . with higher accretion rates ,",
    "the steady accretion is halted by the abrupt expansion at @xmath213 .",
    "what happens after the abrupt expansion is speculated upon in the next section .",
    "as long as the central star is not so massive and its feedback on the accreting envelope is weak , the accretion proceeds at a rate set by the condition of the parent star - forming core .",
    "our assumption concerning the accretion at a pre - determined rate remains valid .",
    "however , when the central star grows massive enough and its feedback , e.g. radiative pressure on the dusty outer envelope , thermal pressure in the hii region , etc . , can no longer be neglected , the accretion rate is now regulated by the stellar feedback . the mass accretion is eventually terminated and the final stellar mass is set at this moment .    among possible types of feedback ,",
    "the radiation pressure on the outer dusty envelope is considered to be the most important in terminating the protostellar accretion ( e.g. , wc87 ) . since",
    "no such outer envelope has been included in our calculation , we evaluate here the epoch of accretion termination by stellar feedback with the assumption that the accretion rate is roughly constant up to this moment .",
    "most of the stellar radiation , emitted in the optical or uv range , is absorbed in a thin innermost layer of the dusty envelope , i.e. , the dust destruction front , and the outward momentum of photons is transfered to the flow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prost_schem ] ) . overcoming this radiation pressure barrier is a necessary condition for continuing accretion .",
    "the condition that the outward radiation pressure falls below the inward ram pressure of the accretion flow is expressed as @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the radius of the dust destruction front , and @xmath216 and @xmath217 are the flow density and velocity there .",
    "the limit on the stellar mass by this condition is shown in figure [ fig : wc ] as a function of the mass accretion rate ( i.e , `` @xmath218 limit '' ) . here",
    ", we have assumed that the flow is in the free - fall . in figure",
    "[ fig : wc ] , the epochs of the maximum swelling and the arrival at the zams are also presented from our results . except in cases with very high accretion rates ( @xmath5 ; ",
    "[ ssec : edd ] ) , the radiation pressure limit is attained after the stars reach the zams .",
    "this verifies previous authors treatment in assuming that the central star is already in the zams phase when the feedback becomes important ( e.g. , wc87 ) .    in reality , the accretion flow is decelerated before reaching the dust destruction front . the radiation absorbed at the dust destruction front is re - emitted in infrared wavelengths and this re - emitted radiation imparts pressure onto the outer flow .",
    "this radiation pressure exceeds the gravitational pull of the star if the luminosity exceeds ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) : @xmath219 which is the `` eddington luminosity '' for dusty gas , calculated by using the dust opacity for the far - infrared light @xmath220 instead of the electron - scattering opacity .",
    "the adopted value @xmath221 is the rosseland mean opacity at @xmath222  k , where the opacity takes the maximum value @xcite . in the outermost region of the dust cocoon , where @xmath223  k and @xmath224 , the deceleration effect is somewhat milder .",
    "this effect becomes significant when the flow reaches the inner warm region .",
    "as shown by the light - shaded region in figure [ fig : wc ] , the deceleration of dusty flow occurs ( @xmath225 ) in a wide range of @xmath69 and @xmath79 . in this case , the upper mass limit by the radiation pressure ( `` @xmath218 limit '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : wc ] ) , which is derived by assuming the free - fall flow , becomes lower : the boundary of the `` @xmath218 limit '' region shifts to the left to some extent . to evaluate this effect more quantitatively and then to identify how mass accretion",

    "it has been shown that the deceleration effect of infrared light is diminished by reduced dust opacity ( wc87 ) , non - spherical accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other various processes ( e.g. , see mckee & ostriker 2007 for a recent review ) .",
    "note that even with the reduced dust opacity , the `` @xmath218 limit '' still remains as long as the dusty envelope is thick enough for optical / uv ( not infrared ) light from the star .    as seen in ",
    "[ ssec : edd ] , for a very high accretion rate of @xmath226 , the radiation pressure acting on the gas envelope terminates the steady mass accretion . figure [ fig : wc ] shows that this limit ( `` quasi-@xmath193 limit '' ) is more severe than the radiation pressure limit for @xmath226 although the deceleration of the dusty flow is already important .",
    "note that wc87 s result on this quasi - eddington limit differs from ours ( see their fig .",
    "this discrepancy comes from their assumption that the forming star is already in the zams , which is not valid in that case . on the other hand",
    ", we have consistently calculated the evolution until this limit is reached and the star begins abrupt expansion .",
    "for such a high accretion rate , what happens when the steady accretion becomes impossible is not clear in realistic situations .",
    "the accreting envelope may be completely blown away and growth of the protostar may be terminated at this point . without accretion ,",
    "the protostar quickly relaxes to a zams star .",
    "another possibility is that since the strong radiation force originates in the accretion luminosity itself , the accretion may continue in a self - regulated way by reducing its rate , for example , by an outflow .",
    "this process may proceed in a sporadic way : the protostar continues to grow alternately repeating eruption and accretion .",
    "if this is the case , the protostar evolves along the trajectory ( iv ) in figure [ fig : wc ] , which runs along the boundary of the prohibited region and the maximum stellar mass is about @xmath227 set by the radiation pressure feedback at the critical accretion rate @xmath228 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wc ] ) .",
    "this is a somewhat higher value than the likely upper mass cut - off of the galactic initial mass function @xmath229 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this disagreement might be due to the deceleration of the outer dusty envelope , which is not included in this analysis .",
    "massive protostars with high accretion rates have some characteristic observational features . in this section ,",
    "we explore possibilities of identifying them observationally and of verifying the postulated high accretion rates .",
    "although protostars still in the main accretion phase are hard to observe directly , pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars just after this phase are optically visible .",
    "the distribution of such pms stars in the hertzprung - russell ( hr ) diagram retains a footprint of the previous accretion phase .",
    "the birthline is the initial loci of the pms stars on the hr diagram as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "the pms stars move down - left toward the zams line on the diagram thereafter .",
    "it has been shown that the birthline for @xmath1 successfully traces the upper envelope of observed distributions of low - mass and intermediate - mass pms stars in the hr diagram @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] , we show the birthlines for various accretion rates .",
    "these tracks are calculated from the interior luminosity @xmath42 and the stellar radius @xmath70 at the end of the accretion , i.e. , when the protostellar mass reaches @xmath69 . without the accretion , contribution to the total luminosity",
    "is now only by the interior one @xmath42 and the effective temperature is given by @xmath230 .",
    "with higher @xmath79 , protostars have larger radii and their birthline shifts toward the upper - right .",
    "this dependence on @xmath79 is consistent with previous calculations @xcite .    if a high accretion rate of @xmath0 is indeed achieved in massive star formation , stars as massive as @xmath231 have not yet arrived at the zams at the end of the accretion phase .",
    "thus , the presence of such massive pms stars is peculiar to the high @xmath79 scenario .",
    "these pms stars are very luminous with @xmath232 , and their effective temperature is much lower than that of the zams stars . although some candidates have been reported very close to the zams line , no such object has yet been firmly detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation for the lack of detection is the very short kh timescale @xmath45 of such pms stars .",
    "for example , in the case with @xmath169 ( run md3 ) , @xmath45 falls below @xmath233yr for @xmath234 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_enuc_tsc_1em3 ] , bottom ) . on the other hand , from the case with @xmath93 ( run md5 ) we see that @xmath235  yr ( @xmath236  yr ) for low- ( intermediate- , respectively ) mass protostars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum_enuc_tsc_1em5 ] , bottom ) .",
    "in addition to the small number of massive stars , such a short duration in the pms phase severely limits the possibility of detection .    as referred to in   [",
    "sec : intro ] , some information of dust - enshrouded protostars has been gleaned from the light re - emitted in the envelope . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reported a unique indirect observation of an embedded massive protostar .",
    "they observed the infrared light from the orion bn / kl nebula , which is scattered by dust grains far away from the exciting protostar .",
    "direct light from the protostar is blocked by a torus - like structure on the line of sight toward us , but likely leaks in the polar direction and is scattered by the nebula . the color temperature of the scattered light is evaluated as @xmath237k from features of the absorption lines .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the protostar is @xmath238 .",
    "if the scattered light is from the photosphere of the star , this low @xmath239 can not be explained by a ms star : @xmath239 of a zams star with the same luminosity is about 35000k , much higher than the above estimation .",
    "@xcite concluded that a very large stellar radius of @xmath240 is needed to explain the low effective temperature .",
    "stimulated by this result , @xcite studied the evolution of protostars with very high accretion rates @xmath241 using a one - zone model .",
    "however , they concluded that stellar radius does not exceed @xmath242 and then failed to reproduce the observed low effective temperature .",
    "in contrast , using more detailed modeling , we have shown that the stellar radius in fact reaches as large as @xmath243 in the cases of high accretion rate . in figure [ fig : kl ] , we present evolution of photospheric temperature and bolometric luminosity for three cases with @xmath37 .",
    "this figure shows that the required condition is satisfied , for example , with the case of @xmath244 for @xmath245 . as a conclusion",
    ", the observation can be explained if the accretion rate is higher than @xmath246 .",
    "the allowed mass range corresponds to the duration of the swelling of the protostar by the luminosity wave ( see   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] ) .",
    "recall that this swelling is caused by very inhomogeneous entropy distribution : the matter near the surface receives a large amount of entropy temporarily . since this",
    "is not included in nakano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) s one - zone model , their model gave a smaller radius than ours .",
    "in appendix  [ sec : one_zone ] , we present calibration of parameters for a polytropic one - zone model to include this effect approximately .",
    "we have studied evolution of accreting protostars by solving the structure of the central growing stars and the surrounding accreting envelopes simultaneously .",
    "particular attention is paid to cases with high accretion rates of @xmath13 , which are envisaged in some current scenarios of massive star formation .",
    "the protostellar evolution at a high mass accretion rate of @xmath49 ( run md3 in table 1 ) can be summarized as follows :    the entire evolution is divided into four characteristic phases ; ( i ) adiabatic accretion ( @xmath52 ) , ( ii ) swelling ( @xmath53 ) , ( iii ) kh contraction ( @xmath54 ) , and ( iv ) main - sequence accretion ( @xmath55 ) phases .",
    "a main driver of transition between the evolutionary phases above is a decrease in opacity in the stellar interior with increasing temperature , and thus protostellar mass . due to the fast accretion ,",
    "the matter accreted onto the stellar surface is embedded into the interior before radiatively losing the entropy produced at the accretion shock .",
    "early in the evolution , the opacity in the stellar interior , which is mainly by free - free absorption , is very high owing to low temperature . as a result of the high opacity , the star keeps a large amount of entropy imported by the accreted matter .",
    "this is the adiabatic accretion phase ( i ) . with the decrease in opacity",
    ", the entropy is transported outward gradually .",
    "when the matter near the surface temporarily has a large amount of entropy , the star expands as large as @xmath247 .",
    "this is the swelling phase ( ii ) . after that",
    ", all parts of the protostar lose energy and the protostar contracts .",
    "this is the kh contraction phase ( iii ) . with contraction , the temperature increases and the hydrogen burning eventually begins .",
    "when the nuclear burning provides sufficient energy to balance with that lost from the star radiatively , the star stops the kh contraction and reaches the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) phase at @xmath248 ( iv ) .",
    "deuterium burning plays little role in the evolution .",
    "even if the deuterium burning is turned off by hand , the result hardly changes .",
    "the swelling ( ii ) is caused by outward transfer of entropy within the star , which is observed as a propagating luminosity wave .",
    "in general , at the higher accretion rate , the protostellar radius is larger and then the maximum temperature is lower at the same stellar mass , owing to the higher entropy within the protostar . as a result of the lower temperature , the onset of the nuclear burning is postponed to the higher protostellar mass .",
    "for very high accretion rate @xmath226 , in the course of the kh contraction , the radiation pressure onto the inner accreting envelope becomes so strong that the flow is retarded before hitting the stellar surface .",
    "the reduced ram pressure onto the stellar surface causes abrupt expansion of the star .",
    "the steady - state accretion is not possible thereafter . at this moment",
    ", the accretion might be halted , or might continue at a reduced rate or in a sporadic way . in either case , the evolution at the critical accretion rate of @xmath249 gives the upper mass limit of pms stars at @xmath211 .",
    "further growth of the star should be finally limited by the radiation pressure onto the outer dusty envelope .",
    "we have found this limit with @xmath250 gives the maximum mass of ms stars at @xmath251 .",
    "such a high accretion rate has also been expected and studied for the first star formation in the universe .",
    "the evolutions of primordial and solar - metallicity protostars are very similar at the same accretion rate .",
    "however , the lower opacity of the primordial gas results in the earlier transitions between the evolutionary phases above . for example , with @xmath49 , the accreting star enters the kh contraction phase at @xmath252 in the solar metallicity case , while it enters at @xmath182 in the primordial case .    distinguishing features of those massive protostars accreting at high rates include the large stellar radius sometimes exceeding @xmath3 , and then low color temperature @xmath253k . a massive protostar in orion bn / kl nebula indeed",
    "has such features and is a possible candidate of such objects .",

    "the shocked gas next enters the relaxation layer behind the shock front and is cooled down by radiative loss . in our formulation",
    ", this detailed structure is not solved , but treated as a mathematical discontinuity ( sst80 ) .",
    "we define the following two points across the discontinuity : a post - shock point , where gas and radiation temperature first become equal behind the relaxation layer , and a post - shock point ahead of the shock front . in our calculations ,",
    "the former is the outer boundary of the protostar , and the latter is the inner boundary of the accreting envelope .",
    "physical states at each point are related by a radiative shock jump condition .    here , we focus on cases where the post - shock quantities are given in advance by the trial outward integration of the protostar ( see   [ sssec : prost ] ) .",

    "the jump condition at the accretion shock front is provided by considering the flow structure across the shock front ( sst80b ) . in the optically - thin case ,",

    "we construct initial models by solving their structure .",
    "the method of calculation is based on that of evolutionary calculations , but with slight modifications .",
    "first , we assume the entropy distribution in the stellar interior as an increasing function with @xmath258 , @xmath308 where @xmath309 is specific entropy at the stellar center , @xmath310 is boltzmann constant , @xmath311 is atomic mass unit , and @xmath312 is a free parameter . in the core interior , we integrate equations ( [ eq : con ] ) and ( [ eq : mom ] ) outward beginning with guessed @xmath309 and central pressure , @xmath313 . according to equation ( [ eq : lpfile ] ) , the luminosity profile there is calculated using an entropy gradient obtained from ( [ eq : s0 ] ) . whereas this procedure is valid in the adiabatic interior , entropy and luminosity profiles should be consistently calculated in place of equation ( [ eq : s0 ] ) near the surface ( also see   [ sssec : prost ] ) . the switching point is defined as follows . using equations ( [ eq : ene ] ) and ( [ eq : relm ] ) , the energy equation can be written as , @xmath314 omitting the nuclear energy production and time - derivative terms .",

    "we have confirmed that some variations of initial models only affect subsequent protostellar evolution in a very early phase . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath316 as the entropy slope in equation ( [ eq : s0 ] ) .      for the opacity",
    ", we adopt opal tables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we examine causes of these differences by exploring some cases with different deuterium abundances and initial models .",
    "the effect of different deuterium abundances on the stellar interior structure in early phases is shown in figure [ fig : str_ddep ] for cases with @xmath321}=3\\times 10^{-5 } , 2.5\\times 10^{-5}$ ] , and @xmath322 .",
    "the middle panel is the same as figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] ( upper ) , but reproduced for comparison . as described in ",
    "[ ssec : md_1em5 ] , our run md5 exhibits somewhat complex evolution of convective layers in the early phase .",
    "a convective layer first appears at @xmath124 , just after the deuterium burning begins .",
    "this convective layer disappears at @xmath126 .",
    "the second convective layer emerges just outside the former outer boundary of the first one at @xmath127 , and quickly reaches the surface .",
    "sst80a calculated the same model , but did not observe such a complex evolution . in their calculation",
    ", the first convective layer survives and eventually incorporates most of the stellar interior .",
    "this difference comes from the fact that the evolution of convective layers sensitively depends on the initial deuterium abundance .",
    "for example , in the case with the deuterium abundance [ d / h ] = @xmath323 ( figure [ fig : str_ddep ] upper ; run md5-dh3 ) , slightly higher than the fiducial value , the convective layer first appears at the same epoch as the fiducial case with [ d / h ] = @xmath33 , and extends outward . in this case",
    ", another convective layer soon emerges at the surface and begins to extend inward .",
    "these two convective layers finally merge at @xmath126 , and render most of the interior convective . at @xmath147 ,",
    "the convective region contains about 97% of the total mass .",
    "these features are very similar to those found by sst80a , who terminated their calculation at @xmath134 .",
    "our calculation shows that the subsequent evolution in this case is almost the same as in our fiducial run md5 .",
    "the central radiative core gradually expands as the stellar mass increases , and finally occupies most of the interior at @xmath324 .",
    "this sensitive dependence on the deuterium abundance is explained as follows .",
    "the expansion of convective layers is caused by increase of the specific entropy within it , which is generated by the nuclear burning at the bottom of the layer .",
    "for continuing expansion of the convective layer , deuterium needs to be supplied continuously .",
    "fresh deuterium becomes available when the convective layer newly incorporates the radiative region .",
    "this deuterium immediately spreads over the convective layer , and is consumed for further nuclear fusion . for sufficiently high deuterium abundance ,",
    "acquired deuterium is high enough to maintain the active nuclear burning . in this case",
    ", the convective layer continuously grows as in the case with @xmath321}= 3\\times 10^{-5}$ ] ( run md5-dh3 ) . on the other hand , for low deuterium abundances ,",
    "the nuclear burning becomes too weak to maintain development of the convective layer .",
    "the convective layer ceases to grow and disappears as in the case with @xmath321}= 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] ( run md5 ) . for even smaller deuterium abundance [ d / h ] = @xmath325 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str_ddep ] , lower ; run md5-dh1 ) , no convective layer appears even after ignition of the deuterium burning until at @xmath326 , when the surface convective layer finally emerges . in this case",
    ", the subsequent mass - radius relation is almost same as in the case without deuterium burning ( run md5-nod ) although the surface convective layer pesists until @xmath327 .",
    "our fiducial run md5 is just intermediate between the deuterium - rich ( run md5-dh3 ) and -poor ( md5-dh1 ) cases presented in figure [ fig : str_ddep ] .",
    "therefore , a slight difference in input physics affects the internal structure significantly .",
    "evolution of accreting intermediate - mass ( @xmath328 ) protostars have been studied in some previous work ( e.g. , ps91 ) .",
    "our results agree well with the previous work , but still show some differences even with the same accretion rate , which can be ascribed to different initial models . whereas our initial model is a tiny radiative protostar with @xmath329 ( see   [ ssec : initial ] ) , the initial model of ps91 , for example , is a @xmath132 fully - convective protostar .",
    "we confirmed that our code reproduces almost the same evolution as that of ps91 , if we begin the calculation with the same initial model .    the initial model of ps91",
    "is constructed in a manner similar to that described in ",
    "[ ssec : initial ] .",
    "the homogeneous entropy distribution is adopted in place of equation ( [ eq : s0 ] ) , and its value is taken from the semi - analytic model of @xcite .",
    "we have reconstructed the model of @xcite , and obtained @xmath330 for a @xmath132 star with our adopted opacity tables . as in   [ ssec : initial ] , we separately solve the core interior and the surface super - adiabatic layer .",
    "first , we integrate the core interior outward from the center with a guessed value of the central pressure .",
    "we also guess the luminosity at the bottom of the surface super - adiabatic layer in advance , and record the entropy gradient @xmath331 using equation ( [ eq : heat ] ) .",
    "once the recorded @xmath331 attains a small finite value , we switch the scheme and integrate all equations ( [ eq : con ] )  ( [ eq : heat ] ) .",
    "the guessed quantities are adjusted for the core to satisfy the outer boundary conditions .",
    "the constructed model is a fully convective star , whose mass and radius are @xmath132 and @xmath332 .",
    "we calculate the subsequent evolution beginning with this initial model ( run md5-ps91 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5_ps ] shows the evolution of such a protostar .",
    "our calculation reproduces the basic features of a calculation done by ps91 , which adopted the same accretion rate and accretion - shock outer boundary . in an early phase ,",
    "the star remains fully convective and deuterium burning occurs around the stellar center .",
    "deuterium concentration significantly falls in this phase .",
    "this is because the central temperature continuously increases , and total burning rate @xmath94 slightly exceeds the steady burning rate @xmath143 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these features are somewhat different from our fiducial run md5 , where a radiative core persists throughout the evolution and gradually expands with the increase in @xmath69 by accretion ( see fig .  [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] ) .",
    "these differences come from different initial models .",
    "figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5 ] also shows that mass - averaged deuterium concentration @xmath103 does not fall much below 0.01 in our run md5 .",
    "this is because the deuterium burning layer gradually moves to the outer layer , where temperature is always around @xmath120  k and @xmath333 . at @xmath334 , for example , @xmath335 in run md5 , but only @xmath336 in run md5-ps91 .",
    "therefore , our calculation predicts that intermediate - mass protostars have a larger amount of deuterium than assumed by ps91 .",
    "figure [ fig : str_fdtmax_1em5_ps ] shows that the fully convective phase ends at @xmath337 , when a thin radiative layer , i.e. , radiative barrier , suddenly appears within the star .",
    "the radiative barrier blocks inward convective transport of the accreted deuterium .",
    "consequently , the inner region , where deuterium has run out , immediately returns to being radiative .",
    "after that , the convective layer remains only above the radiative core , and deuterium burning occurs at the bottom of the convective layer . as in our fiducial run md5 , the protostar swells up at @xmath338 .",
    "ps91 have concluded that this swelling is caused by the shell - burning of deuterium . to see the role of the deuterium shell - burning in the swelling , we also calculate evolution with cessation of the deuterium burning after the appearance of the radiative barrier .",
    "we find that the swelling occurs similarly , although it is slightly delayed , even without deuterium burning .",
    "this is caused by the outward transport of embedded entropy , which is observed as propagation of a luminosity wave ( see   [ ssec : md_1em3 ] and [ ssec : md_1em5 ] ) .",
    "although ps91 have attributed the swelling only to the shell - burning of deuterium , we conclude that the main driver of the swelling is always the propagation of the luminosity wave . after the turn - around of the radius ,",
    "the star enters the subsequent kh contraction phase .",
    "the calculated mass - radius relation thereafter gradually converges with that in our fiducial run md5 .",
    "the epoch of the hydrogen burning , @xmath145 , also agrees with that in the fuducial run .",
    "while detailed numerical calculations as in this paper are a direct method to study the structure of accreting protostars , one - zone modeling with the polytropic equation of state @xmath339 is also a useful way . in the one - zone models of protostellar evolution , which were originally developed by nakano , hasegawa , & norman ( 1995 ) , an energy budget of the protostar",
    "is considered .",
    "the total energy of the star @xmath340 and its time - derivative @xmath341 are written as functions of the stellar mass @xmath342 and radius @xmath343 respectively .",
