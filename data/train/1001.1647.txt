    "the hubbard model is one of the most important models for the electron of solids which describes quantum mechanical hopping of electron between lattice sites and their short ranged repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "this model was discussed by hubbard @xmath0}$ ] in order to describe a narrow - band system of transition metals and has been revised to investigate the properties of highly correlated electron systems such as the copper oxide superconductors and others .",
    "hubbard model exhibits various phenomena including metal - insulator transition , antiferromagnetism , ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "this model assumes that each atom of the crystal lattice has only one electron orbit and the corresponding orbital state is non degenerate .",
    "the hamiltonian of hubbard model is a sum of the two terms @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the atomic contribution , which contains the coulomb interaction term @xmath3 and local electron energy @xmath4 on the atom @xmath5 and hopping hamiltonian @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the creation ( annihilation ) electron operators with local site @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 . because in the thermodynamic perturbation theory we shall use thermal averages in a grand canonical ensemble we have added to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) the term @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the chemical potential and @xmath13 electron number operator .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath13 are the fundamental parameters of the model and because of large value of the coulomb repulsion it is taken into account in zero approximation of our theory .",
    "the operator @xmath14 , which describes hopping of the electrons between sites of the crystal lattice is regarded as a perturbation .    for investigating this model new physical and mathematical concepts and techniques have been elaborated .",
    "we can only enumerate some of them .",
    "there are many analytical approximations as hubbard approximation , noncrossing approximation ( nca ) , slave - boson method , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , composite and others projection operator methods and approaches .",
    "also numerical simulations of thermodynamic quantities and density of states have been performed by various methods .",
    "some exact results for one- and two - dimensional hubbard model are known .",
    "each approximate method has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "a short and comprehensive reviews of the methods can be found in papers and books @xmath15}$ ] . besides these approaches we must enumerate also the special diagram techniques elaborated for strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "stasyuk @xmath16}$ ] , zaitsev @xmath17}$ ] , izyumov @xmath18}$ ] and coworkers have developed a diagram technique for hubbard model , based on the disentangling of nondiagonal hubbard operator @xmath19 out of a time - ordered products of other such operators . due to a more complicate algebra of hubbard transfer operator than that for fermi operators",
    "the essential features of this technique remain till now poorly developed .",
    "the other diagrammatic approach around the atomic limit also has been proposed for hubbard model both in normal @xmath20}$ ] and in superconducting state @xmath21}$ ] .",
    "this theory introduces the generalized wick theorem ( gwt ) that uses cumulant expansion of the statistical average values for the products of the fermion operators .",
    "the gwt takes into account the fact that hamiltonian @xmath2 is nonquadratic in fermion operators due to coulomb interaction .",
    "this last circumstance is responsible for the appearance of the nonvanishing site cumulants called irreducible green s functions .",
    "these new green s functions take into account all the spin , charge and pairing fluctuations of the system .",
    "the perturbation formalism around atomic limit has the advantage that local ( atomic ) physical properties can be evaluated exactly and that the transfer of this local information to neighboring sites due to the kinetic mobility of the conduction electrons can be handled perturbatively in powers of hopping integral .",
    "a gwt for chronological averages of products of electron operators was formulated later also by metzner @xmath22}$ ] .",
    "metzner did not derive a dyson - type equation for the renormalized one - particle green s function and the role of our correlation function has not established .    in spite of the similarity to our works ,",
    "the diagrams in his approach are quite different .",
    "the @xmath23 - particle cumulant is represented a @xmath24 - valent - point vertex with attached @xmath23 entering and @xmath23 leaving lines , where as our such a cumulant or irreducible green function is represented by a rectangle with @xmath24 vertices with @xmath23 entering and @xmath23 leaving arrows .",
    "the rectangle contours the vertices with the same site index but different time and spin labels . in addition",
    "metzner investigated the limit of high lattice dimensions .    in this paper we shall develop the diagrammatic theory proposed before for hubbard model @xmath20}$ ] with the aim to demonstrate the existence of the relation between renormalized quantities of thermodynamic potential and one - particle green s function and also to prove the stationary properties of this potential .",
    "such theorem was proved firstly by luttinger and ward @xmath25}$ ] for uncorrelated systems by using the diagrammatic technique of weak coupling field theory .",
    "the strong coupling diagram theory used by us needs new conceptions and new equations and they are used to prove stationary property of thermodynamic potential for strongly correlated systems . such a proof has been already achieved for anderson impurity model in paper @xmath26}$ ] .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we develop the diagrammatic theory in the strong coupling limit and the skeleton diagrams are introduced . in section iii",
    "we prove the stationary theorem for renormalized thermodynamic potential .",
    "section iv has the conclusions .",
    "we shall use the definition of the one - particle matsubara green s functions in interaction representation as in paper @xmath20}$ ] : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for @xmath29 and index @xmath30 for @xmath31 means the connected part of the diagrams which appear in the right - hand of part of ( 5 ) .",
    "we use the series expansion for the evolution operator @xmath32 with some generalization because we introduce the auxiliary constant @xmath33 and use @xmath34 instead of @xmath14 : @xmath35 in the presence of this constant we shall use index @xmath33 for all dynamical quantities as @xmath36 and so on . at the last stage of the calculations",
    "this constant will be put equal to one .    in zero order approximation",
    "the one - particle green s function @xmath37 is local @xmath38 and the fourier representation of the last function is @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energies of atomic sites .",
    "as has been proved in papers @xmath20}$ ] propagator ( 5 ) has the diagrammatic representation depicted on the fig .",
    "1 .        the irreducible green s functions of order @xmath23 are depicted with rectangles with @xmath24 vertices .",
    "the arrows which enter in the vertex point depict annihilation electrons and that which go out the created electrons .    in paper @xmath42}$",
    "] we have introduced the notion of correlation function @xmath43 which is the sum of strongly connected diagrams containing irreducible green s functions and related to a more convenient function @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "1 the fourth and seventh diagrams of the right - hand site belong to correlation function . due to the fact that irreducible functions are local and tunneling matrix elements have the property @xmath45 in fig .",
    "1 are omitted all the diagrams which contain self - locked tunneling elements .    as is seen from fig .",
    "1 the process of propagator renormalization is accompanied by the analogous process for tunneling matrix elements renormalization and replacing of the instant quantity @xmath46 by dynamical one @xmath47 equal to @xmath48 which in fourier representation @xmath49}\\nonumber \\ ] ] has a form : @xmath50 the renormalized tunneling matrix element @xmath51 really is tunneling green s function and will be depicted as double dashed line .",
    "@xmath52 is represented by such double dashed line multiplied by @xmath33 .",
    "now we introduce the skeleton diagrams which contain only irreducible green s functions and simple dashed lines without any renormalization . in such skeleton diagrams",
    "the thin dashed lines are replaced by double dashed lines with realizing the complete renormalization of dynamical quantities .",
    "the skeleton diagrams for correlation @xmath53 function are depicted on fig .",
    "2 .    as can bee seen from fig .",
    "2 the skeleton diagrams for @xmath54 function are of two kinds .",
    "the first four diagrams of this figure are local and therefore their fourier representation do nt depend on momentum .",
    "the last diagram and other ones with more number of rectangles are non localized and their fourier representation depends on momentum .",
    "only the first category of diagram are taken into account in dynamical mean field theory .        as was proved in papers @xmath20}$ ]",
    "the knowledge of this function permits to formulate the following dyson - type equation for one - particle green s function @xmath55 here @xmath56 stands for @xmath57 with odd matsubara frequencies .",
    "equation ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) gives us the results @xmath58 equation ( 12 ) has a form of dyson equation for tunnelind green s function , and the role of mass operator @xmath59 is carried out by correlation function multiplied by auxiliary constant @xmath33 : @xmath60 in hubbard i approximation we neglect the correlation function @xmath61 and consider function @xmath62 equal to zero order green s function @xmath63 . in this approximation",
    "we have @xmath64 which describes two hubbard energy subbands distanced between them for @xmath65 and without the possibility to describe the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the system is determined by the connected part of the mean value of the evolution operator @xmath20}$ ] @xmath66 let us consider a more general quantity first @xmath67 and put then @xmath68 .    by using the perturbation theory",
    "we have obtained the first orders of diagrams for @xmath69 , depicted in fig .",
    "3 .        in order to obtain the better understanding of these diagrammatic contributions we examine the expression @xmath70 where double repeated indices suppose summation and integration . consequently ( 16 ) is equal to @xmath71 here we have carried out the integration by time",
    ".    from diagrammatic point of view equation ( 16 ) implies the procedure of locking of the external lines of propagators @xmath72 diagrams depicted on the fig .",
    "1 with the tunneling matrix element @xmath73 and obtaining in such a way the diagrams without external lines similar with ones for @xmath74 depicted on fig .",
    "these two series of diagrams differ by coefficients in front of them .",
    "in expression ( 17 ) the coefficients @xmath75 before each diagram are absent , where @xmath23 is the order of perturbation theory .",
    "these coefficients are present in fig .",
    "3 . in order to restore these @xmath75 coefficients in ( 17 ) and",
    "obtain the coincidence with @xmath69 series it is enough to integrate by @xmath33 the expression ( 17 ) and obtain : @xmath76 the expression ( 18 ) displayed in a diagrammatic representation coincides exactly with mean value of the evolution operator : @xmath77 in fourier representation we have @xmath78 from ( 15 ) and ( 20 ) we obtain @xmath79 using the definition ( 14 ) , the equation ( 21 ) can be written in the form : @xmath80 from ( 22 ) we have @xmath81 in order to have a full system of equations we add to ( 22 ) the definition of the chemical potential of the system @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the electron number .    equation ( 21 ) establishes the relation between thermodynamic potential and renormalized one - particle propagator .",
    "this last quantity depends on the auxiliary parameter @xmath33 and ( 21 ) contains an additional integration over it and is awkward because that .",
    "we shall obtain more convenient equation for thermodynamic potential without such integration by @xmath33 .",
    "for that we shall introduce a special functional @xmath84 where @xmath85\\exp(i\\omega_{n}0^{+ } ) , \\label{26 } \\ ] ] and @xmath86 is constructed from skeleton diagrams without external lines and is depicted on fig.4        the dependence on @xmath33 in the functional @xmath86 is twofold , just through the dependence of the renormalized green s functions @xmath87 and @xmath59 and through the explicit factors @xmath88 in front of each diagram of @xmath86 .    by using these definitions we can prove the equations @xmath89 and as a result we obtain the stationary property : @xmath90 by using the definition ( 13 ) of the mass operator @xmath91 we can rewrite the functional @xmath92 in the form @xmath93\\exp(i\\omega_{n}0^{+ } ) , \\label{29 } \\ ] ] and prove the second form of stationary property @xmath94 if we take into account the dyson equation for tunneling function @xmath95 .",
    "now we shall discuss the derivative by @xmath33 of the functional @xmath96 . as was mentioned above",
    "there is twofold dependence of @xmath33 through @xmath91 and explicit through the factors @xmath88 before skeleton diagrams of @xmath86 fig .",
    "4 .    due to the stationary property ( 30 )",
    "we obtain @xmath97 here we have taken into account the equation ( 30 ) and that that @xmath92 has not explicit dependence of @xmath33 .    by using fig . 4 for @xmath86 and the definition of @xmath53 of fig .",
    "2 it is easy to establish the property : @xmath98 therefore from ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) we obtain : @xmath99 from equation ( 23 ) and ( 33 ) we have @xmath100 and as the consequence we obtain @xmath101 because for @xmath102 perturbation is absent and @xmath103,@xmath104 we have @xmath105 now we can put @xmath68 and to obtain @xmath106 with the stationary property @xmath107",
    "we have developed the diagrammatic theory proposed for hubbard model many years ago and introduced the notion of renormalized tunneling green s function @xmath108 in addition to known before .",
