    "since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in an atomic bose gas @xcite , the field of ultracold gases has been one of the most active fields in physics .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that these gases are very clean , accessible , and easy to manipulate . for",
    "both theorists and experimentalists , ultracold atomic gases have therefore become an important playground for the study of a diverse set of quantum phenomena , that often in other guises also appear in very different condensed - matter systems . at present also degenerate atomic fermi gases are available @xcite and have been at the center of attention in the last two years . in particular , the superfluid bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase has been created in two - component fermi mixtures @xcite . to overcome the problem of the small critical temperature , which depends in general exponentially on the interaction strength , all experiments have made use of a feshbach resonance @xcite . in this manner the interactions between the atoms can be strongly enhanced by an external magnetic bias field , giving rise to the bec - bcs crossover phenomenon @xcite . as a result of the atomic physics of the feshbach resonance ,",
    "the nature of the cooper pairs in the bec - bcs crossover is , however , not solely determined by the interaction strength or scattering length , but in principle also depends on the width of the feshbach resonance . in the limit of an infinitely broad resonance , the properties of the gas can be derived from a single - channel theory that requires only the resonant scattering length as an experimental input . in general , however , a two - channel theory is needed .",
    "this is in particular true for the description of the wave function of the cooper pairs that plays an important role in the bec - bcs crossover as we will show in this paper .    in the crossover experiments with atomic @xmath0li , on which we focus mostly in this paper , the atomic gas is spin polarized with respect to the electron spin of the atoms . in the event of a collision",
    ", the two atoms therefore approach each other in a triplet state , which is called the open channel . due to the hyperfine interaction ,",
    "there is a nonzero coupling to a closed singlet channel , which has a different interatomic interaction potential that , most importantly for our purposes , contains a bound molecular state .",
    "this bound molecular state we call the bare molecule from now on",
    ". moreover , the triplet state has a magnetic moment , and the energy of the two incoming atoms can thus be tuned by a magnetic field due to the zeeman effect . near a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the threshold energy of the open channel is exactly tuned near a bound state of the closed channel and the nonzero coupling between the two channels causes the scattering cross section between the atoms to be resonantly enhanced , in a similar manner as in many collision experiments discovering new elementary particles in high - energy physics .    in this paper",
    "we aim at presenting a theory of the bec - bcs crossover that includes ( gaussian ) fluctuations on top of the mean - field theory .",
    "moreover , we include the above mentioned two - channel physics of the feshbach resonance exactly and in this way improve upon the various theories @xcite that have also been used to discuss different aspects of the bec - bcs crossover observed experimentally .",
    "some consequences of our theory were previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we considerably expand upon that work by giving a detailed derivation of our bogoliubov , or random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , theory and present new results in the bec , unitarity , and bcs limits of the theory .",
    "the main physical idea behind the theory is that the entire bec - bcs crossover can be seen as a bose - einstein condensation of pairs or dressed molecules , that in the extreme bec limit are the bare molecules , and in the bcs limit the atomic cooper pairs .",
    "the wave function of these dressed molecules is given by the linear superposition @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interatomic distance .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the probability of the dressed molecule to be in the bare molecular state in the closed - channel of the feshbach resonance .",
    "the spatial part of the bare molecular wave function is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the spin part of the bare molecule is equal to @xmath6 , in agreement with the fact that it is a bound state in the closed channel .",
    "the open channel has the spin state @xmath7 and the spatial part of the wave function in this channel is @xmath8 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the well - known wave function of the cooper pairs in bcs theory . that this is a sensible way to describe the system at low temperatures , follows from the fact that it contains the correct physics in both extremes . in the extreme bec limit",
    "the dressed molecules are just bare molecules , i.e. , @xmath9 . in the bcs limit",
    "we have @xmath10 and the dressed molecules correspond to the bcs cooper pairs with the wave function @xmath8 . in between these two limits",
    "the probability @xmath4 changes gradually and in this manner describes the smooth crossover from the bec to the bcs limit .",
    "this important microscopic parameter has indeed been measured recently for @xmath0li by partridge _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and was shortly thereafter calculated theoretically for that case in ref .",

    "in particular , we give a simple two - body derivation of the probability @xmath4 , that is then generalized in sec .",
    "iii when we discuss in detail the many - body bogoliubov theory for the bose - einstein condensation of the feshbach molecules . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the theory to the broad feshbach resonance of @xmath0li at a magnetic field of @xmath1 g. we here present results for the probability @xmath4 , the spectral function of the molecules , and the speed of sound in the gas throughout the bec - bcs crossover . in sec .",
    "v we briefly discuss the qualitative difference that would occur in these quantities if the feshbach resonance in @xmath0li would be much narrower . in sec .",
    "vi we consider the bec , unitarity , and bcs limits of the theory .",
    "we end our paper in sec .",
    "vii with some discussion and conclusions .",
    "for several reasons it is most convenient to start with the discussion of the relevant two - body physics of the feshbach resonance .",
    "first , it is a natural way to introduce the probability @xmath4 , that describes the exact bound state wave function of the two - body hamiltonian .",
    "second , it gives a quantitative description for the problem that works quite well in the bec - limit , where there are no free atoms in the gas and the bose - einstein condensate of dressed molecules is well described by two - body physics .",
    "third , it illustrates how to incorporate not only the resonant scattering , but also the background scattering of the atoms , which turns out to be very important in the case of the extremely broad feshbach resonance in @xmath0li of interest to us .    for two atoms",
    ", we can simplify the feshbach problem by first splitting off the center - of - mass motion . in that manner",
    "we arrive at the time - independent two - channel schrdinger equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the relative motion in the presence of the background interaction @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the component of the two - body wave function in the open ( triplet ) channel , and @xmath15 is the component of the two - body wave function in the closed ( singlet ) channel .",
    "the bare detuning from resonance is given by @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the coupling between the open and closed channels .",
    "we formally eliminate @xmath14 from eq .",
    "( [ twobody - schrodinger ] ) , by making use of the fact that the energy of the exact molecular bound state that we want to determine never lies in the spectrum of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath18 , and insert a complete set of states in the resulting expression . in the case of a large and positive background scattering length , there exists a bound state @xmath19 just below the threshold of the scattering continuum of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "since this bound state may be relevant we include it explicitly as well .",
    "in this manner we ultimately find @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the energies of the atomic scattering states @xmath22 .",
    "we focus on the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2bodyder ] ) that is due to the continuum of scattering states , and leave the second term due to the bound state for later .",
    "we would like to use the pseudopotential approximation for the matrix element @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we rewrite the first term by using the definition of the two - body @xmath24-matrix @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the incoming plane - wave state associated with the scattering state @xmath22 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath27 for long wavelengths , the scattering properties of any interatomic potential become hard - core like , as the incoming particles have too low energies to probe the structure of the interaction potential .",
    "the background scattering is then described by a single parameter , the background scattering length @xmath28 . moreover",
    ", the conservation of probability then leads to the simply result @xmath29 . as a result",
    ", we can introduce the coupling parameter @xmath30 , that describes the coupling between the two channels by means of @xmath31 hence the continuum contribution in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "we have that @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we have written @xmath39 to indicate that this term gives the self - energy of the molecules , which follows from the fact that the energy of the exact molecular bound state is found from @xmath40    now we wish to include also the bound state in the case of a large and positive background scattering length . for the moment we do not assume that the bound - state energy lies at @xmath41 , but we initially use @xmath42 , where @xmath43 may be different from @xmath28 due to effective - range effects . to determine the contribution of the bound state",

    "the closed - channel component in the bcs - limit is @xmath225 it is important to notice that in this bcs limit , @xmath4 and the density contribution of the bose - einstein condensate of bare molecules @xmath226 have an entirely different behavior as a function of detuning . from the gap equation",
    "it can be derived that the gap vanishes exponentially , @xmath227 thus the ratio between @xmath4 and @xmath224 diverges linearly with the detuning .",
    "this shows that these are different entities with different physical meanings .",
    "for @xmath114 we can make a rough estimate of @xmath4 , that gives a simple physical reason for why @xmath4 is small for broad feshbach resonances . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bcsplaatje ] , the most notable result of the many - body theory is the gap around the fermi surface .",
    "in contrast to two - body physics , where @xmath4 goes to zero at resonance , the many - body physics stabilizes the pairs , much like cooper - pairs . for broad resonances ,",
    "the spectral function has a long tail at high energies , which is not affected by many - body physics because it lies far above the fermi energy .",
    "using the fact that the spectral function is normalized to one , we can thus approximate the spectral weight in the delta function by integrating the two - body spectral function over an energy interval of twice the gap .",
    "@xmath228 from our calculations , the gap at unitarity is equal to @xmath229 , which is quite close to the monte - carlo result of @xmath230 @xcite . substituting this in eq .",
    "( [ unitz ] ) results in an approximate value for @xmath4 of @xmath231 , which is only about 20% lower than the result of our bogoliubov theory .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover near a feshbach resonance is very rich in physics .",
    "we have presented a theory that rigorously incorporates the two - body feshbach physics and , due to the inclusion of fluctuations , allows for an accurate study of the full crossover problem , both for broad and narrow resonances .",
    "we calculated the probability @xmath4 , that is crucial in understanding the microscopic physics of the crossover , and studied the molecular spectral function and the spectrum of collective modes throughout the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "where possible , we have compared our theory with experiment and have found a satisfying agreement , even in the unitarity limit where the interactions are very strong .",
