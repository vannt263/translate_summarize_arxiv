    "recent advances in nanofabrication technology increasingly enable the construction of devices operating in the quantum regime .",
    "however , to utilize coherence effects for practical applications such as quantum information processing and communication tasks requires the ability to engineer their dynamics with high precision .",
    "considerable progress in the area of laser technology and optimal control has shown that precise coherent manipulation of the dynamics is not infeasible for a variety of quantum systems , but such control requires accurate knowledge of the system s dynamical behavior and response to external fields , which can be used to construct accurate models from which effective control designs can be engineered .",
    "the problem is particularly acute for manufactured systems , due to inevitable variations in the manufacturing processes , which ensure that the exact behavior of each device is unique and must be individually measured and characterized .    for the manufacture of large - scale practical devices ,",
    "the design and operation of each device should be as simple as possible meaning that the physical resources available to initialize and measure the state of a system are usually restricted to a single basis set defined by static electrode geometry . in normal operation , any state can be produced from an initial fiducial one by applying a suitable unitary rotation .",
    "this also enables us to effectively perform measurements in an arbitrary basis , and given both these abilities , one can perform quantum process tomography  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of characterizing a device is not trivial since initially , if one does not yet know the control response of the system , one can not generate the unitary rotations required in the first place , leading to a catch-22 situation .",
    "what is required is a method of bootstrapping the control and characterization process so that the system dynamics and response can be incrementally assessed until full control and process tomography is possible , and only using the _ in situ _ resources .",
    "hence , we have developed techniques based upon the analysis of generalized coherent oscillation data from rabi or ramsey - type experiments .",
    "there are several approaches to the analysis of such experimental data including frequency - domain and time - domain analysis . in the regime of a single system transition ,",
    "fourier analysis is effective but in the presence of multiple signals , it ceases to an optimal estimator .    in previous work ,",
    "we have shown how bayesian signal analysis can be effective in determining accurate model parameters in generic two - qubit hamiltonian systems where multiple frequencies are present . in this work ,",
    "we extend the technique to systems with dephasing and use bayesian signal analysis to reconstruct the underlying dynamics , which are now non - unitary .",
    "we apply this technique to three - level ( qutrit ) systems and analyze its performance for a range of dephasing rates and find that as long as coherent dynamics dominate , which would be the case for quantum information purposes , signal parameters can generally be reliably extracted and the system effectively reconstructed .",
    "the evolution of a closed quantum system is governed by a time - dependent unitary operator @xmath0 obeying the schrodinger equation .",
    "the evolution of an open quantum system can be highly complicated but under certain conditions it can be described by a master equation @xmath1+l_d\\rho(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath2=ab - ba$ ] is the usual matrix commutator , @xmath3 is a super - operator describing the interaction with the environment , and @xmath4 is a unit - trace positive operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 representing the state of the system .",
    "this form of master equation is generally applicable to systems interacting with a memory - less ( markovian ) reservoir such as an effectively infinite bath , where it can be shown that the superoperator @xmath6 takes the form @xmath7\\rho$ ] , where @xmath8 are operators on @xmath5 and the superoperators @xmath9 $ ] are defined by @xmath10\\rho = v_k \\rho v_k^\\dag                   -\\frac{1}{2}(v_k^\\dag v_k\\rho + \\rho v_k^\\dag v_k).\\ ] ] under certain conditions we can make further simplifying assumptions . for example , dissipative effects in open systems weakly coupled to an environment are often dominated by a certain types of decoherence such as pure phase relaxation or population relaxation processes such as the spontaneous emission of photons or phonons .",
    "these types of processes can be described by relatively simple master equations . in the case of pure dephasing the dissipation superoperator",
    "is often determined by a single hermitian operator @xmath11 . in this case , it is easy to show that the master equation simplifies @xmath12 - \\frac{1}{2 } [ v,[v,\\rho(t)]].\\ ] ] even with these simplifying assumptions on the open system dynamics we see that full system identification now requires the identification two generally independent hermitian operators @xmath5 and @xmath11 , which in general means the identification of @xmath13 real parameters .",
    "fortunately , dephasing often acts in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian , in which case @xmath5 and @xmath11 commute and are simultaneously diagonalizable , i.e. , there exists a basis @xmath14 such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real , and in this case the identification problem reduces to finding a joint eigenbasis @xmath14 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath5 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this simplifies the problem .",
    "if @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the representation of the state in a joint eigenbasis of @xmath5 and @xmath11 then it is easy to see that the master equation ( [ eq : lme ] ) gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , we have @xmath24 and if @xmath25 is the unitary basis transformation that maps the measurement basis to the joint eigenbasis of @xmath5 and @xmath11 , then the evolution of the density operator @xmath4 with respect to the measurement basis is given by @xmath26 . thus the evolution is determined by the transition frequencies @xmath27 , dephasing rates @xmath28 and the relation between the system and measurement basis @xmath25 , which are to be determined .",
    "as in previous work  @xcite we assume that we can prepare and measure the system in a fixed set of ( orthonormal ) computational basis states @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hilbert space dimension . no other measurements or resources such as non - basis states are assumed to be available initially .",
    "the basic protocol is to prepare the system in a computational state , let it evolve for a period of time , then measure the probabilities that the system ends up in one of the computational basis states , repeating it for different times and all computational basis states .",
    "the experimental data thus consists of @xmath31 time traces , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , which represents the probability that the system , initially in state @xmath34 is measured in state @xmath35 after evolving under the system hamiltonian for time @xmath36 .     if it was original initialized in @xmath37 . at long times , noise dominates the signal which leads to an optimal total sampling time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when we include dephasing in the hamiltonian eigenbasis , it can be shown that the observable probabilities are @xmath38 where the coefficients are    [ eq : coeff ] @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the amplitude and phase of the complex number @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the phase difference .    if the hamiltonian is known to be real - symmetric in the computational basis , which is the case for many systems including atomic and molecular systems , where the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are usually real transition strengths or dipole moments , and spin systems , the problem can be simplified .",
    "the eigenvectors of a real - symmetric matrix are real , thus the phases @xmath41 must be multiples of @xmath44 so that @xmath45 , and since the sine of a multiple of @xmath44 vanishes , we have @xmath46 . in many cases the signs of the off - diagonal matrix elements are also known , e.g. for a spin chain in an anti - ferromagnetic material , the off - diagonal elements are positive , as the case for many atomic or molecular systems .",
    "we then have @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which further simplifies the reconstruction .",
    "this shows that the identification problem for dephasing that acts in the system s natural basis is similar to the hamiltonian identification problem except that we also have to determine the dephasing rates @xmath28 . from the measurement results obtained from time",
    "traces like in fig .",
    "[ fig : datasignals ] , we must extract signal frequencies @xmath27 and damping rates @xmath28 as well as the amplitudes @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in order to be able to perform reconstruction of the system dynamics .    we can do this again by bayesian estimation , maximizing the likelihood that a particular process generated the observed signal  @xcite . for convenience",
    "we label the transition frequencies of the system @xmath53 , assuming @xmath54 , and the corresponding dephasing rates @xmath55 , and define the vectors @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 range from @xmath61 to @xmath30 and @xmath62 from @xmath61 to the number of transition frequencies @xmath63 . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : probs ] , the traces should be linear combinations @xmath64 of the @xmath65 basis functions    [ eq : case1 ] @xmath66    or in the case where @xmath5 is real - symmetric , the @xmath67 basis functions    [ eq : case2 ] @xmath68    and our objective is to find parameters @xmath55 , @xmath53 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath50 that maximize the likelihood of the measured data @xmath71.\\ ] ]    we can eliminate the explicit dependence on the linear coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath50 and the noise variances @xmath74 by integration over suitable priors to obtain an explicit expression for the probability of a particular model given the observed data @xmath75 that depends only on the @xmath63 transition frequencies @xmath53 and corresponding dephasing rates @xmath55 . following standard bayesian analysis  @xcite",

    "a global optimization such as pattern search or evolutionary algorithms might circumvent this problem , but neither proved either very effective in our case , especially for higher - dimensional search spaces .",
    "alternatively , starting with a somewhat reasonable initial guess , especially for the frequencies , a standard quasi - newton optimization method with cubic line search  @xcite proved generally very effective in finding the global maximum .    to obtain an initial estimate for the frequencies we used the sum of the power spectra of the signals . although the peaks in the power spectrum are not optimal frequency estimators when there are multiple frequencies and the exact peak locations can be difficult to ascertain even for systems with only three frequencies , as fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows , rough estimates of the peak locations usually seem to provide a reasonable initial guess for the gradient - based likelihood optimization routine . in principle",
    "the damping rates could be estimated from the peaks widths as well but these estimates can be tricky , especially for overlapping and minor peaks , hence we chose multiple runs with random initial guesses for the damping rates @xmath92 and selected the run with the highest final likelihood ( `` global '' maximum ) .    given the extracted signal parameters we have to solve two further inverse problems : ( i ) reconstructing the level structure from the frequencies and ( ii ) constructing the matrix @xmath25 that relates the hamiltonian basis to the computational basis .",
    "the former usually involves analyzing the relationships between the frequencies as illustrated in  @xcite . in general",
    "this is be tricky but for a qutrit system , is analysis is essentially trivial .",
    "the basis reconstruction requires solving further optimization problems to find the coefficients @xmath100 such that eqs  ( [ eq : coeff ] ) are satisfied given the estimates for the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath50 and @xmath103 derived in the previous step .",
    "due to finite sampling and noise , the inversion may not be exact , hence we recast it as a constrained optimization problem and solve it as described in  @xcite .",
    "our previous analysis  @xcite also shows that we can only identify a single generic hamiltonian up to equivalence @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a diagonal unitary matrix , in the basis of the measurement . however , if the off - diagonal elements in the hamiltonian are known to be real and positive , for instance , then the hamiltonian will be uniquely determined up to a global energy level shift @xmath106 , at least in the generic case , since we have @xmath107 for @xmath108 . for a quantum control situation ,",
    "the system dynamics can be controlled and hence different hamiltonians can be applied , and in the case subsequent hamiltonians can be fully determined up to the gauge fixed by the initial hamiltonian . by varying control parameters and tracking the change in the system dynamics , a dynamical control model can be built of the system .",
    "we randomly generated 100 real - symmetric qutrit hamiltonians and dephasing operators with different spectral properties and the geometric average of the system @xmath109-factors ranging from 12 to 72 .",
    "from these we generated various data traces corresponding to the stroboscopic sampling described in section [ sect : exp ] .",
    "we considered three cases , the zero noise case ( @xmath110infinite samples per point ) , fixed finite sampling with @xmath111 experimental repetitions per time point , and an adaptive sampling strategy @xmath112 which varies the number of samples per point to reach an estimated target signal to noise ratio of @xmath113 for all @xmath60 and @xmath36 with an upper limit of @xmath114 for each data point .",
    "we then applied our parameter estimation and reconstruction algorithms to the resulting data traces .",
    "a range of dephasing rates was studied to see the effect on the reconstruction of the hamiltonian part of the dynamics . for the purposes of control ,",
    "accurate determination of the hamiltonian is much more important than a precise determination of the dephasing rate , usually it suffices to know that they are below certain limits .",
    ".median likelihoods ( @xmath115 ) and error rates ( @xmath116 ) for qutrit systems . for the 100 qutrit systems we compared the case with and without dephasing ( superscript h ) for different samples ( @xmath117 ) per data point . with no sampling noise @xmath118",
    ", there was a small change in the median errors . for the @xmath119 case ,",
    "the median errors increase due to the sampling noise , the addition of dephasing increases the final error by an order of magnitude to the @xmath120 region .",
    "a simple adaptive scheme @xmath112 does similarly .",

    "the frequency @xmath122 estimation is slightly more accurate but estimation of the signal amplitudes @xmath51 is slightly less accurate since the basis functions depend on @xmath123 , hence errors in both @xmath122 and @xmath123 contribute to errors in the coefficients @xmath51 . for reduced signal to noise",
    ", dephasing decreases the maximum likelihood and increases frequency , basis and reconstructed hamiltonian errors with a marked increase in median of the amplitude errors .",
    "adaptive sampling overall increases the accuracy of the parameter estimation step and the reconstructed hamiltonian for both hamiltonian and dephasing systems but the improvement is more pronounced for dephasing systems",
    ". this may be due to adaptive sampling being more beneficial for small signal amplitudes i.e. , decaying signals .",
    "this suggests the use of adaptive sampling to increase the signal to noise ratio for samples at increasing times .",
    "alternatively , the sample data can be weighted to give precedence to earlier samples .",
    "further exploration of these methods will be the subject of future study .",
    "dephasing leads to a reduction in signal at long times which can lead us to fitting noise . for strong dephasing ,",
    "this leads to reduced accuracy in the estimation of the frequencies , and hence increased errors in the other parameters .",
    "the spread in the fourier peaks can also lead to problems for closely spaced frequencies .",
    "this in itself is not a problem _ per se _ for the bayesian parameter estimation step  @xcite , except that it can lead to inaccurate initial search parameters coming from peak detection in the power spectrum .",
    "this can be obviated somewhat by trying different initial parameters assuming that either of the two remaining peaks were doublets and using the most likely result .    for systems of interest for quantum information processing",
    ", the dephasing rates should be sufficiently low so that the damping of the rabi - type oscillations do not impact the scheme greatly .",
    "for very small dephasing rates , however , it can be a problem if the algorithm overestimates the dephasing rates which means that the basis functions used are not suitable , and this is reflected in errors of the estimated amplitudes . for such systems , it is a simple enough matter to test models which are purely hamiltonian to see which gives the larger likelihood",
    ".     for various samplings shows a strong correlation and suggests that the total error in the hamiltonian is dominated by errors in the basis reconstruction step that comes about from the separate optimization of each basis function from the amplitude estimation , which may not lead to orthogonal data vectors.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one factor which limits the reconstruction is that we may obtain a set of @xmath124 matrices @xmath125 , which ideally should be projectors onto orthogonal eigenspaces , but may not always form an orthogonal set of projectors .",
    "we can quantify this basis error by @xmath126 fig .",
    "[ fig : serror ] shows that there is a strong correlation between @xmath127 and the ( relative ) error in the final reconstructed hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we can use @xmath127 to choose the best reconstructed hamiltonian from multiple optimization runs and as a rough indication of the likely accuracy of the reconstructed hamiltonian .",
    "the data also suggests that there is little direct correlation between the likelihood and errors in the parameter estimation step and the final hamiltonian error , suggesting that the final error in the hamiltonian is dominated by errors in the basis reconstruction step .",
    "the reconstruction step obviously depends on the parameter estimates obtained in the first step , and poor estimates for the parameters will generally result in large hamiltonian errors , but in some cases the basis reconstruction produces poor results even when the individual errors in the estimated parameters are small .",
    "it should be possible to improve the reconstruction step by solving the @xmath31 optimization problems for the @xmath100 simultaneously rather than independently and enforcing orthonormality constraints for the basis vectors , but doing so would require solving a rather more complicated optimization problem with several nontrivial constraints .",
    "other researchers have also begun to address the problem of system characterization with limited resources .",
    "for example , leghtas et al .",
    "@xcite also consider estimating parameters of three - level quantum systems using weak continuous population measurements .",
    "however , in their case it is assumed that most of the system is already known including the transition frequencies and the precise structure of the hamiltonian , and there is no intrinsic decoherence .",
    "they consider extracting only two real parameters of the system , the dipole transition strengths between levels 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 , which simplifies the problem enormously .",
    "burgarth et al .",
    "@xcite also consider hamiltonian characterization with restricted resources for heisenberg spin chains where only a small subset of spins are individually addressable .",
    "the form and structure of the hamiltonian is known _ a priori _ to be of a particular class , and only the coupling strengths and anisotropy of the system hamiltonian are to be determined . the sign of the couplings is also known beforehand .",
    "characterization is achieved in this case by preparing different initial states of the first spin , letting the system evolve and then performing quantum state tomography on the accessible spins .",
    "if we consider a system of three spins , the first excitation subspace acts as a qutrit .",
    "our protocol could be applied to this problem with some modifications .",
    "our scheme does not require state tomography , only the determination of position of the up - spin , and there is no requirement to know the network topology .",
    "it would be interesting to explore bayesian analysis of the response of such systems for hamiltonian characterization , and especially the role of topology in identifiability , and whether it is possible to relax the requirement for addressability of all spins .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that our current two - step procedure of bayesian parameter estimation followed by a reconstruction via optimization works in the presence of dephasing on three - level systems . however , we find that the reconstruction step is a weak point of our current implementation",
    ". it may be possible to eliminate the parameter estimation step and directly apply bayesian maximum likelihood estimation upon the dynamical system parameters .",
    "this would have the advantage of always giving admissible solutions at all steps .",
    "another direction which should be explored is adaptive sampling , not only varying experimental repetitions per data point , but also using non - uniform time - domain sampling for better frequency discrimination ."
