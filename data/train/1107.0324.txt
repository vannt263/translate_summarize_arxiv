    "the so - called pearson random walk describes the evolution of particles starting from a point - source and performing straight - line displacements until collision events , where either the direction of propagation changes at random with probability @xmath1 ( scattering ) , or the trajectory is terminated ( absorption )  @xcite . when the traversed medium is homogeneous , so that the scattering centers are uniform , the inter - collision distances ( flights ) are exponentially distributed .",
    "exponential flights are key to understanding the dynamics of many transport processes , encompassing areas as diverse as radiation transfer , electron motion in semiconductors , gas dynamics , and search strategies  @xcite . in most such applications ,",
    "one is typically interested in assessing the particle density @xmath2 ( or some functional defined on @xmath2 ) averaged over a @xmath3dimensional volume @xmath4 in the phase space . in reactor physics , for instance , @xmath2 might represent the number of particles escaping from radiation shielding  @xcite .",
    "the particle density of exponential flights , in turn , is intimately connected to the statistical properties of the collisions @xmath5 falling in the region @xmath4 , and the residence time @xmath6 spent within @xmath4  @xcite . even under simplifying hypotheses , namely , that scattering and absorption probabilities do not depend on particle energy , so that we can safely define an average speed @xmath7 ( one - speed approximation ) , and that scattering is isotropic , the interplay between @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 turns out to be a deceivingly simple problem , and has attracted a renovated interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "for instance , when the typical size @xmath8 of the volume @xmath4 is much larger than the mean free path @xmath9 between collisions , namely , @xmath10 ( the so - called diffusion limit ) , the normalized distribution of collision number @xmath11 and the normalized probability density of residence times @xmath12 converge to each other  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) .",
    "this is in general not true when @xmath8 is comparable to @xmath9 , i.e. , when finite speed effects and boundaries come into play , and particles spend only a limited number of collisions in @xmath4 before wandering away , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) .",
    "= 9.0 cm    aside from its theoretical interest for understanding the dynamics of exponential flights in bounded geometries , the study of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is also motivated by their prominence in monte carlo methods . in view of the intrinsic stochastic nature of exponential flights ,",
    "one is naturally led to resort to monte carlo simulation , which can guide the development of analytical solutions , and , in most realistic applications , provide the answers that are not accessible by analysis alone  @xcite . in plain monte carlo methods , the volume - averaged particle density @xmath2 for one - speed transport",
    "can be estimated by simulating particle trajectories in the phase space and either counting the collisions @xmath5 in @xmath4 , or measuring the length @xmath13 of particle tracks within @xmath4 . in the former case , we have @xmath14 , whereas in the latter @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "as speed is assumedly constant , we can equivalently compute @xmath16 by measuring the residence time @xmath17 that particles spend in @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the two estimators described above are unbiased with respect to @xmath2 , which amounts to saying that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes averaging with respect to particle trajectories , and the limit is attained for an infinite number of realizations  @xcite .",
    "this in particular implies that the two estimators are related by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the average flight time . such a property non - trivially holds for any kind of boundaries imposed on @xmath4 and stems from the memoryless ( markovian ) nature of the underlying exponential flight process  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] suggests that @xmath6 and @xmath23 , while preserving the same average , will generally have different higher order moments , and in particular different variances .",
    "hence , there might be an advantage in using either estimator for determining the desired particle density @xmath2 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in the following , we address the issue of characterizing the distribution of collisions @xmath5 and residence times @xmath24 in a volume @xmath4 for exponential flights .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the trajectory @xmath25 of exponential flights in the phase space is defined by the stochastic evolution of position and direction , starting from the point - source @xmath26 at time @xmath27 .",
    "due to the exponential nature of the displacement lengths , the stochastic process @xmath28 is markovian . in other words ,",

    "the propagator @xmath29 defines the probability density for the walker being at a point @xmath30 in the phase space , at a time @xmath31 , having started from the initial condition .",
    "the propagator of exponential flights satisfies a probability balance , the forward chapman - kolmogorov equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the forward transport operator @xmath34 here we have set @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the scattering mean free path , and the integral over directions is normalized to @xmath38 , i.e. , the surface of the unit sphere .",
    "we introduce then the collision density @xmath39 which intuitively represents the equilibrium distribution of the particle ensemble .",
    "remark that the propagator @xmath29 depends on the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath40 .",
    "the absence of boundary conditions corresponds to defining a fictitious ( ` transparent ' ) volume @xmath4 , where particles can indefinitely cross @xmath40 back an forth . on the contrary",

    "knowledge of all moments suffices to describe the associated distributions . in the following",
    ", we derive explicit expressions that allow evaluating the moments @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of the equilibrium distribution @xmath46 .      in a series of seminal works based on feynman path - integral formalism",
    ", kac  @xcite has worked out a general method for deriving the residence time distribution when the underlying stochastic process is a brownian motion @xmath47 , and later showed that his results hold more generally for markov processes  . for a review ( focused on brownian motion ) ,",

    "more generally , the definition in eq .   allows for multiple exits and re - entry crossings of @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of kac approach is the stochastic integral @xmath54 , where the expectation is taken with respect to the propagator @xmath55 , i.e. , the probability density of performing a trajectory from @xmath56 at @xmath57 to @xmath58 at time @xmath59 , namely , @xmath60 the existence and well - posedness of eq .",

    "the standard approach would therefore imply first solving eq .   for @xmath61 , and obtaining then @xmath66 by performing an inverse laplace transform .",

    ".   thus allows expressing the moments of the residence time as a function of the particle equilibrium distribution .",
    "= 8.0 cm      in a previous work  @xcite , we have explicitly derived the moments of the collision number @xmath23 for a broad class of renewal processes , when the point - source emits isotropically . for exponential flights , it is sufficient to remark that the process",
    "@xmath79 , i.e. , the direction - averaged position of the walker , is markovian at each collision event .",
    "the probability of performing @xmath23 collisions in the volume @xmath4 is related to the propagator by @xmath80 we introduce the direction - averaged collision density @xmath81 the derivation of the moments @xmath82 closely follows that of @xmath83  @xcite .",

    "the approach presented in the previous section allows explicitly evaluating the moments @xmath44 and @xmath45 . when the equilibrium distribution is known , this amounts to solving the convolution integrals in eqs .   and  , respectively .",
    "however , analytical expressions for @xmath46 or @xmath88 ( subject to the appropriate boundary conditions ) are known only in a few cases  @xcite , so that one must generally resort to numerical integration .",

    "though the rod model is somewhat inadequate to address realistic radiation transport phenomena , we shall discuss it here for two main reasons .",
    "first , it allows illustrating the application of the above formulas for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and provides some hints on their use as monte carlo estimators .",
    "second , the rod model , despite being admittedly oversimplified , is nonetheless widely used in biology ( often called velocity jump process ) , gas dynamics ( lorentz gas ) , finance and neutronics , as it captures the essential features of the corresponding physical system  @xcite .",

    "the second moments @xmath155 and @xmath156 are displayed in fig .",
    "it is immediately apparent that @xmath157 ( actually , equality is attained only for @xmath158 ) : this means that for this example the use of a track length estimator is to be preferred , as it would lead to a smaller variance .",

    "the solutions of the rod problem   and   are given by combinations of exponential functions , rather than linear polynomials .",
    "in this case , the expressions for the moments are rather cumbersome and will not be reported here .",
    "instead , we plot the moments as a function of the initial condition @xmath146 , the domain size @xmath8 and the scattering rate @xmath1 . in fig .",

    "this means that in presence of absorption the collision estimator may lead to a smaller variance . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we display the difference @xmath162 when @xmath163 , for various values of @xmath1 : when @xmath8 is large , @xmath156 becomes larger than @xmath155 , and this behavior is enhanced for small values of @xmath1 , i.e. , large absorption rates .",
    "when @xmath8 is large , the dependence on the angular variable @xmath164 gets progressively weaker , so that the integrals   and   coincide . under this assumptions ,",
    "calculations show that @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , independent of the initial condition .",
    "then , from the equality of the kac convolution integrals , the difference @xmath162 for large @xmath8 converges to the limit @xmath167 , which implies a smaller variance for the collision estimator .",
    "we have also verified that @xmath154 and @xmath156 satisfy the surface- and volume - averaged recursion property in  @xcite , which generalizes eq .",
    "to residence times .",
    "again , all analytical results have been validated by comparison with monte carlo simulations .",
    "motivated by their relevance for stochastic transport phenomena as well as for monte carlo methods , in this paper we have examined the moments of collision number @xmath23 and residence time @xmath6 of exponential flights in a volume @xmath4 .",
    "we have presented a general approach that - based on the kac moments formula - allows explicitly evaluating such quantities in terms of repeated convolutions of the particle equilibrium distribution . to exemplify the proposed formalism ,",
    "we have in particular analyzed a @xmath0 system , the so - called rod problem , where closed form expressions can be found .",
    "we have therefore explicitly computed the moments of @xmath23 and @xmath6 for various boundary conditions , focusing in particular on the first and second moment .",
    "finally , the relevance of these findings in the context of monte carlo collision and track length estimators has been discussed .",
    "results show that the averages of @xmath23 and @xmath6 coincide , whereas the second moments ( hence the variances ) depend on boundary and initial conditions , and on the scattering probability .",
    "residence time has in general a smaller variance , but the opposite is true when absorption dominates over scattering .    by virtue of the increasing power of monte carlo methods in solving realistic three - dimensional transport problems , one might argue that such a simple system as the rod problem has a limited interest . on the contrary , we are persuaded that this analysis is useful , in that it allows focusing on the essential features of the physical system at hand .",
    "indeed , on one hand it sheds light at the deep connections between sojourn times and collision number for exponential flights , and on the other hand it gives some hints on the behavior of the intrinsic variance of monte carlo collision and track length estimators .",
    "extending the proposed approach to higher - dimensional and more complex systems is highly desirable , and investigations to this aim are ongoing .",
