    "modern realizations of composite higgs models rely on the hypothesis of partial compositeness , each sm state has a heavy partner with equal quantum numbers under the sm symmetries , see @xcite and references therein . until recently most studies focused on the so called `` anarchic scenario '' where the sm light quarks are mostly elementary and the top largely composite @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis hides strong coupling effects from flavor and electroweak observables but also eliminates the typical collider signatures of compositeness .    in references",
    "@xcite it was shown that a different philosophy is possible within the partial compositeness paradigm , where one chirality of sm light quarks has large compositeness .",
    "these scenarios are in fact strongly motivated by flavor physics . assuming universal couplings for either left - handed or right - handed fermions allows to realize the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) @xcite in strongly coupled theories , solving the flavor problem of composite higgs models @xcite . here",
    "the compositeness of the up quark can not be small , it being determined by the one of the top .",
    "generalisations allowing to split the third generation can also be considered @xcite .    in this note",
    "we will focus on the phenomenologically attractive scenario of composite right - handed quarks that is weakly constrained by precision electroweak tests allowing a large degree of compositeness , see @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "we will study in detail the collider phenomenology extending and updating the results in @xcite .",
    "the experimental signatures are dramatically different from the ones of the widely studied anarchic models @xcite .",
    "there the fact that the proton constituents are elementary makes it difficult to produce the new states at the lhc .",
    "if right - handed up and down quarks are composite instead , the couplings to the strong sector will be large .",
    "this implies larger production cross sections for the heavy states that can be tested with present lhc data .",
    "the typical collider signatures of our scenario are jet final states .",
    "in particular we derive a strong bound on gluon resonances from the latest dijet searches at lhc .",
    "the phenomenology of heavy fermions depends on the chirality of the associated sm particles .",
    "partners of left - handed quarks can be singly produced through electroweak interactions with large cross sections already at the 8 tev lhc .",
    "this places a stringent and rather model independent bound that can be extracted from an atlas search @xcite .",
    "partners of right - handed quarks are instead more difficult to produce and lead to final states with up to six jets and no missing energy .",
    "we find that present multi - jet lhc searches , tailored for supersymmetric scenarios , are mostly insensitive to this signature even in the r - parity violation case .",
    "bounds could be here significantly improved with dedicated searches and we suggest some possibilities that could be explored by the experimental collaborations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : compositelightquarks ] we review the model and discuss the relevant features of right - handed compositeness .",
    "we emphasize in particular the importance of chromomagnetic interactions . in section [ sec : coloroctet ]",
    "we discuss the phenomenology of the color octet .",
    "the relevant experimental searches will be discussed and limits on the octet mass extracted . in sections",
    "[ sec : lefthandedpartners ] and [ sec : righthandedpartners ] the collider signatures of heavy quark partners will be discussed .",
    "available searches will be analyzed and dedicated search strategies will be proposed in section [ sec : dedicatedsearches ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : compositemodel ] the model used in our simulations is presented and in appendix [ sec : ptordering ] the @xmath0 distribution in single production of heavy quark partners is discussed .",
    "within the framework of partial compositeness sm fields mix with states of the composite sector of equal quantum numbers under the sm symmetries , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "all the new states are classified according to representations of the composite sector global symmetry .",
    "we will make the minimal assumption that this contains @xmath1 .",
    "the sm yukawa couplings are schematically given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the mixings matrices of left and right chiralities of the sm quarks with the composite states .",
    "the coupling @xmath4 , in general a matrix , has a typical strength that characterizes the composite sector .",
    "for simplicity we will often assume this to be equal to the coupling of spin-1 resonances @xmath5 but it should be kept in mind that these are in principle independent parameters .",
    "the standard assumption , naturally realized in randall - sundrum scenarios , is that the degree of compositeness is controlled by the mass of the sm states . within this logic",
    "the light generations are practically elementary and couple only through mixing of the sm gauge fields .",
    "this property makes the new states experimentally well hidden both from direct and indirect searches .",
    "it was pointed out however that at least the right - handed chiralities of the light generations could be composite @xcite . in this case the effects of compositeness are more visible at lhc because the proton constituents are strongly coupled to the composite states . despite the large degree of compositeness , corrections to precisions observables measured at lep are small and can be compatible with experimental bounds .",
    "this perhaps counterintuitive possibility is in fact quite naturally realized if the right - handed quarks couple to singlets of the custodial symmetry .",
    "moreover this possibility is automatic in scenarios that realize the mfv hypothesis @xcite because a flavor symmetry relates the compositeness of the up quark to the one of the top that is necessarily large .",
    "contrary to anarchic scenarios , composite light quarks have striking experimental signatures that could be seen at lhc . among the new states we will consider the lightest partners of the up and down quarks . for the right - handed quarks we assume that these are singlets of @xmath6 while left - handed quarks will be associated to bi - doublets . for the up sector",
    "we have , @xmath7 the full model can be found in the appendix .         of the composite spin one",
    "states only the gluon partner , a massive color octet vector , will be included .",
    "we assume that the color octet couples as a gauge field with strength @xmath8 .",
    "electroweak resonances will not be studied here but we expect the rough features to be similar .",
    "the mixing with sm quarks generates the trilinear couplings of the heavy gluon of figure [ fig : rhocouplings ] with strengths @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) a light ( heavy ) quark .",
    "analogous formulas hold for the left - handed chiralities",
    ". we will be interested in the situation where the right - handed up and down quarks are significantly composite .",
    "strictly in mfv models @xmath13 but this can be relaxed in more general constructions based on @xmath14 flavor symmetries @xcite .",
    "the sm right - handed quarks can couple to gluon resonances with a trilinear coupling @xmath15 as large as @xmath16 .",
    "moreover the partners of right - handed quarks can be produced and decay through the heavy - light vertex in figure [ fig : rhocouplings ] .",
    "on the other hand the vertex with left - handed partners is negligible because the compositeness of left - handed light quarks is extremely small .    for electroweak interactions the situation",
    "is exactly reverted , see figure [ fig : rhocouplings ] . in the limit of zero quark masses in the up sector",
    "the relevant vertices are @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 is the up sector fermionic coupling , see appendix [ sec : compositemodel ] .",
    "these interactions allow to singly produce the partners of left - handed quarks .",
    "higgs interactions are also generated but we will not study them here , for more information see @xcite .",
    "the last important ingredient in our analysis will be the chromomagnetic operator @xmath20 this dimension five operator is relevant in our analysis because it controls the decay of the right - handed partners in the region @xmath21 where the decay into @xmath22 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "it is generated by loops of the strong sector fields with a size ( see appendix [ sec : compositemodel ] ) @xmath23    let us briefly comment on the scenario where left - handed quarks are strongly composite . here",
    "precision electroweak tests , in particular modified coupling to the @xmath24 , strongly disfavours large compositeness .",
    "one finds @xcite , @xmath25 repeating the analysis above implies that cross sections not larger than in the anarchic scenario will be obtained , at least for the scales and couplings that we expect in composite models that address the hierarchy problem .",
    "in fact due to the opposite sign of the two contributions in eq .",
    "the couplings may even turn out to be smaller . in what follows",
    "we will only consider the scenario with composite right - handed quarks .      in this paper we will study the phenomenology of the gluon resonance , partners of left - handed quarks @xmath26 and partners of right - handed quarks , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we focus on the first generation partners whose mass is however equal to the one of the top partners under the mfv hypothesis .",
    "the searches are very sensitive to the spectrum of the new states .",
    "we will mostly work under the assumption that the fermionic scale @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "this hypothesis appears to be necessary for the theory to be natural , given that spin one particles lighter than @xmath31 tev are disfavoured . on the other hand",
    "new vectorial fermions are the most relevant from the naturalness point of view , have weaker direct bounds .    in our simulations we generate event samples with madgraph5 @xcite , using a model generated with feynrules 1.6 @xcite .",
    "the parton level events are passed to pythia 6.4 @xcite to simulate the effects of parton showering , and then to delphes 2.0 @xcite or atlfast @xcite for a fast detector simulation .",
    "we use the default cms and atlas parameters for delphes depending on what experimental analysis we are comparing with , and reconstruct jets with the anti-@xmath32 algorithm @xcite using @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the jet cone radius respectively .",
    "these simulated events are then analyzed using the experimental analyses , providing a method to interpret the relevant experimental searches in terms of our model .",
    "among possible spin-1 resonances we will focus on the gluon partner , a color octet with mass @xmath30 .",
    "the experimental searches of dijets and @xmath35 by cms and atlas imply important bounds on the parameter space of our scenario that we derive in this section .",
    "constraints on spin one resonances from flavor physics are not necessarily negligible , even if mfv is realized , as certain operators ( in particular @xmath36 ) are generated at tree level @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these bounds are more model dependent ( for example they could be avoided in extensions of mfv ) and we will not include them here ( see however @xcite ) .           the color octet can be produced through the drell - yan process @xmath37 of figure [ fig : octetpheno ] . through the coupling with light quarks , it can be copiously produced at lhc if @xmath38 is sufficiently large .",
    "no gluon fusion is possible due to gauge invariance",
    ".    the decay of the @xmath39 will play an important role in the phenomenology . the decay into sm right - handed quarks is equal for all generations while only the one into @xmath40 is relevant for left - handed quarks .",
    "if the heavy fermions are lighter than the color octet the decay into a single heavy and one sm fermion or two heavy fermions ( for @xmath41 ) will be possible .",
    "since the couplings to the composite states are large this can affect strongly the phenomenology .",
    "the decay modes are displayed in figure [ fig : octetpheno ] .",
    "analytic formulas for the partial widths read @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\      \\gamma ( \\rho \\to q \\bar q , \\ , q \\bar q ) & = \\frac{\\alpha_s}{12 } m_\\rho \\left ( 1 - \\frac{m_q^2}{m_\\rho^2 } \\right )   \\left ( 1 - \\frac{m_q^2}{2m_\\rho^2 } - \\frac{m_q^4}{2 m_\\rho^4 } \\right ) \\left [ \\left ( x_l^{qq } \\right)^2 + \\left ( x_r^{qq } \\right)^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      \\gamma ( \\rho \\to q \\bar q ) & = \\frac{\\alpha_s}{12 } m_\\rho \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\\rho^2 } } \\left [ \\left ( 1 - \\frac{m_q^2}{m_\\rho^2 } \\right )   \\left [ \\left ( x_l^{qq } \\right)^2 + \\left ( x_r^{qq } \\right)^2 \\right ] + 6 \\frac{m_q^2}{m_\\rho^2 } x_l^{qq } x_r^{qq } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 s are the couplings as defined in equation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : octetwidth ] the width of the color octet changes drastically when the decay modes to one or two heavy fermions open up . in the last case",
    "the resonance is very broad .    .",
    "the width increases significantly as the decay channels to the quark partners open up , these qualitative features hold independently of the mixings . _ _ ]      we start our analysis considering compositeness bounds reported by atlas and cms , see also @xcite . in the large @xmath30 limit we can integrate out the color octet and replace it with an effective four fermion operator .",
    "such an operator produces dijets with an angular distribution different from the qcd that allows to distinguish it from the background .",
    "the experiments in particular place a bound on the effective operators with light quarks , @xmath45 that can be recast in our scenario .",
    "recent experimental results on the angular distributions of dijet final states by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite imply @xmath46 the @xmath47 superscript refers to the sign of the coefficient , and the atlas analysis only considers the case of destructive interference .",
    "cms provides an exclusion for both signs of the coefficient and the most constraining one is used .",
    "note that the operators with heavy quarks ( such as @xmath48 ) are expected to be less relevant at lhc since dijet production requires a quark - antiquark initial state in that case , a process suppressed by the protons pdfs . integrating out the heavy color octet one generates the four fermion operator @xcite @xmath49 using the strongest",
    "bound reported by cms and the coefficient in equation we derive @xmath50 both constraints by atlas and cms are displayed in figure [ fig : dijetbounds ] .",
    "the compositeness of right - handed down quarks is slightly less constrained due to the predominance of up quarks in the proton .",
    "note that the sign of coefficient obtained integrating out heavy vectors ( a similar conclusion holds for scalars ) is fixed and corresponds to the most constrained sign in the cms analysis .",
    "hence , it is useful that the experiments report the bound for both signs of the operator .      .",
    "in blue , region excluded by compositeness bounds . in red ( atlas ) and green ( cms ) exclusion from direct production .",
    "the different regions correspond to @xmath51% confidence level exclusion for two hypothetical scenarios where the quark partners are light ( @xmath52 tev , solid contour ) or heavy ( @xmath53 tev , dashed contour).__,title=\"fig : \" ] . in blue , region excluded by compositeness bounds . in red ( atlas ) and green ( cms ) exclusion from direct production .",

    "the natural search strategy is to look for a bump in the invariant mass distribution of dijets .",
    "we emphasize that this search is of a very different nature compared to compositeness bounds that rely on the angular distribution of dijets to distinguish new physics effects from the enormous qcd background . while the effective operator bound is limited by the energy of the accelerator , the on - shell production , when kinematically accessible , is limited by statistics .",
    "we use the most recent analyses of atlas @xcite and cms @xcite based on @xmath55 tev data .",
    "the experiments provide a limit on @xmath56 of resonances coupled to light quarks that can be applied to our scenario .",
    "we follow the procedure given by atlas for a gaussian resonance with a particular width ranging from zero to 15% .",
    "roughly the same strategy is applied to the cms search , which provides limits on @xmath57 .",
    "our bounds are conservative as we explicitly take into account the width of the resonance .",
    "both atlas and cms perform a search for a relatively narrow resonance through a bump hunter algorithm . if the width of the the resonance exceeds a certain threshold the bump hunter search is invalidated and hence we discard the limit whenever the color octet width is above @xmath58% . in the @xmath30 and mixing angle plane , a grid of points is generated for which @xmath59 are computed , and the efficiencies of the experimental cuts are analyzed .",
    "the results are compared to the experimental limit , that only depends on the resonance mass , and are then interpolated to form exclusion regions .",
    "the limits for a resonance with @xmath60 are presented in figure [ fig : dijetbounds ] .",
    "the blue region corresponds to the bound on the effective four fermion operators discussed in the previous section .",
    "the exclusion due to the on - shell production is given by the red and green regions .",
    "this exclusion limit depends strongly on the fermionic spectrum , because of two reasons .",
    "one is the increase in the width of the resonance possibly invalidating the search .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant when the decay into two heavy partners is kinematically accessible , see figure [ fig : octetwidth ] .",
    "moreover when other channels open up the signal strength is reduced since only the decay into sm quarks will generate a bump in the invariant mass distribution of the two leading jets .",
    "for this reason the region with @xmath61 tev is weakly constrained .",
    "note also that model independently the region of high compositeness is not constrained because the width is in this case always too large .       in mfv models compared to the experimental benchmark randall - sundrum model .",
    "the blue region corresponds to a width greater than @xmath62 where the experimental bounds are not be applicable . in this comparison",
    "the assumption is made that the decay to heavy fermions is kinematically forbidden . _ _ ]    in anarchic scenarios gluon resonances are strongly coupled to the third generation and decay mostly into top quarks .",
    "for example in randall - sundrum scenarios as considered in reference @xcite one finds that the branching of heavy gluons into top right is almost @xmath63% . to connect with our parametrization",
    "this model roughly corresponds to @xmath64 , @xmath65 for the light quarks and @xmath66 for the top quark .",
    "a strong bound on gluon resonances is obtained through searches of resonances that decay into @xmath67 pairs .",
    "exclusion limits for this benchmark point have been reported in the searches from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . in the case of the randall - sundrum benchmark",
    "the heavy gluon resonance is excluded below @xmath68 tev at @xmath51% confidence level .    in models that realize mfv , or more generally",
    "models with composite light quarks , the situation is different both for the production and decay of the heavy gluon , and one may obtain an even stronger bound . in these models the decay into third generation is typically not dominant .",
    "this depletion of the signal is however easily compensated by the increased production cross section .",
    "to get an idea of the bounds in this case , we can estimate @xmath69 by rescaling the couplings of the anarchic scenario .",
    "the numerical result is presented in figure [ fig : ttbarmfv ] .",
    "we see that the cross section in @xmath35 is typically larger than in anarchic scenarios . as a consequence slightly stronger",
    "bound will apply .",
    "searches by atlas ( red ) and cms ( green ) .",
    "the exclusion limits correspond to @xmath51% confidence level for two hypothetical scenarios where the quark partners are light ( @xmath52 tev , solid contour ) and where they are heavy ( @xmath53 tev , dashed contour).__,title=\"fig : \" ]   searches by atlas ( red ) and cms ( green ) .",
    "the exclusion limits correspond to @xmath51% confidence level for two hypothetical scenarios where the quark partners are light ( @xmath52 tev , solid contour ) and where they are heavy ( @xmath53 tev , dashed contour).__,title=\"fig : \" ]    one caveat must be considered : similarly to the dijet searches , the experimental bound is obtained by looking for bumps in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath35 pairs .",
    "this procedure depends on the width of the resonance and becomes inefficient for large widths . in anarchic scenarios the resonances are relatively broad . in the example of @xcite",
    "the width is below @xmath70% of the mass .",
    "the width can be larger in the mfv scenario due to multiplicity factors and the decay to heavy quark partners , as explained in the section above .",
    "the blue region in figure [ fig : ttbarmfv ] corresponds to a width greater than @xmath62 . in this region",
    "the experimental bound must be reconsidered .",
    "this region is however excluded by compositeness bounds discussed in the previous section . to compare the limits with the dijet searches also an exclusion plot in the @xmath71 plane",
    "is provided in figure [ fig : ttbarbounds ] .",
    "these exclusion plots have been obtained in a similar fashion as for the dijet limits from the previous section , including a careful treatment of the width of the heavy partners possibly invalidating the @xmath67 search .",
    "we should mention that in extensions of the mfv scenario based on @xmath14 rather than @xmath72 flavor symmetries the compositeness of the third generation can be different from the first two @xcite .",
    "those scenarios are attractive phenomenologically as the light generations can be mostly elementary , avoiding compositeness bounds but with the same virtues as mfv for what concerns flavor . in this case",
    "the phenomenology of heavy gluons will be similar to anarchic scenarios .      summarizing the direct limits on the color octet depend heavily on the fermionic spectrum .",
    "we differentiate two scenarios , one with light fermionic partners , @xmath73 and one with heavier partners @xmath74 . in the first we find , @xmath75 at @xmath51% confidence level . for the heavy scenario",
    "we find the constraint @xmath76 that is slightly stronger than the bound in anarchic scenarios .",
    "this constraint holds for all values of the mixings @xmath77 and tighter bounds on the octet mass are obtained for specific mixings .",
    "more stringent bounds can be inferred from from flavor physics and precision tests but these rely on extra assumptions on the structure of the theory and do not directly test the hypothesis of large compositeness of the first and second generation .",
    "we start our study of fermionic partners with the left - handed sector , focusing in particular on the @xmath26 colored fermions . these states can of course be pair produced through strong interactions , see @xcite for a study in anarchic scenarios .",
    "as we will see in the next section the exclusion on top partners of reference @xcite can be translated in mfv scenarios into an exclusion of these states around 600 gev . here",
    "we derive the bound obtained from single production through the electroweak vertices of figure [ eq : octetquarkcouplings ] . using the results in @xcite",
    "we derive a bound significantly stronger than the one on top partners .",
    "the single production of left - handed partners is dominated by @xmath78-channel exchange of electroweak gauge bosons producing a forward jet ( @xmath79 ) and a heavy quark .",
    "this decays mainly through weak interactions into jets and @xmath80 , @xmath24 or higgs .",
    "the jet has the same flavor of the mother particle so that only light quark jets are obtained in the final state .     obtained from the search of charge 2/3 ( 5/3 ) heavy quarks .",
    "the regions above the lines are excluded . _ _ ]    in the anarchic scenarios only third generation quarks can be produced in this way because the coupling is proportional to the degree of compositeness that is significant only for the third generation . to produce third generation partners one needs to scatter a @xmath80 or @xmath24 boson and a top , the latter originating from the splitting of a gluon .",
    "this will be perhaps the most promising channel for the production of heavy fermions at lhc14 @xcite but in the present run suppression from pdfs and low luminosity is too severe for this process to be dominant .",
    "this is different with composite light quarks since the heavy partners can be directly produced with the proton constituents . in this case",
    "one can produce the left - handed partners through diagram b ) in figure [ fig : fermionprod ] with access to the valence quarks of the proton .",
    "a related aspect is that the width of the resonance is larger than in anarchic scenarios .",
    "the search of vector like quarks coupled to the first generation was performed by the atlas collaboration based on @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and can be applied to our scenario .",
    "we use the most recent results in @xcite obtained with 5 fb@xmath81 luminosity and 8 tev energy .",
    "the search constrains directly the combination @xmath82 .",
    "the derived exclusion is shown in figure [ fig : crossx ] for the charge 2/3 and exotic charge 5/3 states , the latter being the strongest . recall that in mfv scenarios there is a constraint , @xmath83 necessary to reproduce the top mass . from this",
    "it follows that the left - handed partners are often excluded up to 2 tev and always below 1.5 tev .",
    "this can only be avoided in extensions of mfv where the third generations can be split @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this is an extremely strong bound that pushes the model into fine tuning territory . in view of the recent discovery of a @xmath84 gev resonance @xcite some of the fermions associated to the top",
    "should be light if the theory shall remain natural .",
    "recent analyses have shown that the lightest top partner should be typically below @xmath85 tev in a natural theory @xcite . in mfv scenarios the mass of the top partners",
    "is the same as the one of the light generations , up to mixing effects .",
    "hence , we can translate the bound on the light generations into a bound on the top partners .",
    "the phenomenology of partners of right - handed quarks is entirely different as they can not be singly produced by electroweak interactions and they mostly decay into two or three jets leading to multi - jet final states .",
    "the majority of multi - jet searches at lhc , being motivated by supersymmetry , assumes a large missing energy typically of the order of few hundreds gev or more . in our scenario ,",
    "the missing energy in the event is a consequence of jet calibration accumulated by all jets , typically below 50 gev .",
    "therefore , we do not expect vanilla supersymmetric searches to play a role in constraining the parameter space of right - handed compositeness .",
    "analysis of the relevant atlas and cms searches will be done in the next two sections , separated into single production ( through heavy resonances ) and double production ( both through qcd and heavy resonances ) .",
    "dedicated searches that could improve the experimental reach will be discussed in the section 6 . before analyzing the different searches at the lhc we first review production modes and decay channels in detail .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the experimental signatures and bounds of partially composite higgs models where right - handed quarks are strongly composite .",
    "this scenario , strongly motivated by flavor physics , was until recently very weakly constrained experimentally .",
    "the situation is rapidly changing with the lhc results that are progressively carving out significant regions of parameter space .",
    "we presented the most relevant bounds that can be extracted from the latest lhc data .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the experimental strategies to test these models at lhc are of a different nature from the ones of the more studied anarchic scenarios or supersymmetry .",
    "in particular they typically produce jet final states without leptons or missing energy . for this reason",
    "existing analysis are in some cases not optimal and could be improved with dedicated searches .",
    "one of the most important constraints on right - handed quark compositeness arises from dijet searches .",
    "these place a direct bound on the spin one gluon resonances . in some regions of parameters these states are excluded up to 3 tev but the result is strongly sensitive on the fermionic spectrum .",
    "we also derive bounds on the masses of the lightest fermionic partners .",
    "these are particularly relevant given their role for the naturalness of the theory .",
    "in the light of the 125 gev higgs discovery some fermions should be lighter than 1 tev for a small tuning of the theory @xcite .",
    "one interesting experimental feature is that single production of the new fermions dominates the bounds unlike the case of anarchic scenarios where at present double production produces the strongest constraints .",
    "we derive an extremely strong bound on the left partners that are excluded up to 2 tev in theories that realize mfv .",
    "this is obtained from single electroweak production of partners of the up quark studied by the atlas collaboration .",
    "right - handed quark partners can be singly produced through the gluon resonances with smaller cross sections and different final states .",
    "the direct bound is much weaker in this case .",
    "overall our study shows that models that realize mfv are at least as tuned as the anarchic scenarios .",
    "this can be avoided abandoning mfv in favour of theories based @xmath14 flavor symmetry @xcite where the light generations can be more elementary than the top , see also @xcite for a related discussion .",
    "we conclude by noting that our scenario motivates more general experimental searches than the ones presently published .",
    "this is already possible with the existing data with minor modifications of experimental analyses . in particular our multi - jet signals",
    "could be more efficiently captured with a different ordering of jets .",
    "dijet studies should also be extended to trijets .",
    "let us also mention that the multi - jet signals originate from quarks , whereas the background is dominated by high - multiplicity qcd gluons .",
    "therefore , jet tagging techniques , such as in reference @xcite , would be valuable to reject the background .",
    "we hope that these efforts will be pursued by the experiments .",
