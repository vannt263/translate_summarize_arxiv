    "giant pulses ( gps ) have been reported in four pulsars ( b0531 + 21 , b1937 + 21 , b1821@xmath124 and b0540@xmath169 ) todate ( staelin & reifenstein  1968 ; lundgren et  al .  1995 ; cognard et  al .",
    "1996 ; romani & johnston  2001 ; johnston & romani  2003 ) .",
    "three of these pulsars are millisecond pulsars ( msps ) and also show strongly pulsed hard x - ray profiles ( takahashi et  al .",
    "the radio gps occur in a narrow phase window close to the high energy non - thermal pulse indicating a common magnetospheric origin .",
    "all these pulsars have a high value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have used gmrt to search for gps in candidate msps with a non - thermal high energy emission and a range of @xmath0 and report detection of such pulses in two more pulsars , psr j0218 + 4232 and b1957 + 20 .",
    "we obtained about 3600 s of data on each pulsar using 20 to 22 gmrt antennae in an incoherent mode at 610 mhz with 16 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the expected rms noise in the above configuration of gmrt for a sampling time of 258 @xmath2 is about 1 jy . the data in two subbands ( 8 mhz each ) were dedispersed to a common sky frequency ( 610 mhz ) .",
    "the periods with a peak greater than 3.5 times rms in both bands at the same sample were identified as large amplitude pulses ( laps ) .",
    "this procedure disperses any narrow interference spike discriminating against interference .",
    "a number of marginal laps , i.e. pulses with a peak between 3.0 to 3.5 times rms , were also identified .",
    "we searched 2.2 million periods for psr j0218 + 4232 ( @xmath3 3.2 @xmath4 g ) and found three significant laps .",
    "figure 1a shows the integrated profile for this pulsar and the detected laps are marked with filled circles .",
    "the largest of these had an intensity 51 times the mean intensity ( intensity of lap , @xmath5 jy-@xmath6s ) .",
    "our data also consisted of 9 marginal laps , 7 of which occur between phase 0.89 - 1.2 , which is the phase interval corresponding to one of the high energy peaks .",
    "we searched about 1 million periods for psr b1957 + 20 ( @xmath3 3.8 @xmath4 g ) and found one significant lap , shown in figure 1b , with an intensity 129 times the mean intensity ( @xmath7 jy-@xmath6s ) .",
    "in addition , we also detected 5 marginal laps .",
    "psrs b1957 + 20 and j0218 + 4232 have the fourth and sixth highest values of @xmath0 respectively of known radio pulsars .",
    "hence , these new detections support a connection between the magnitude of @xmath0 and the existence of gps and laps .",
    "the data for pulsars with @xmath0 marginally below @xmath8 g are being analyzed currently .    ,  i. et  al .",
