    "the integrable spin chain @xmath2 constructed in 1992 by de vega and woynarovich @xcite shows a rich physical structure with different ground states depending on the anisotropy parameter and the two coupling constants . in our previous papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite we have analyzed this structure and calculated several important quantities . in this paper we deal mainly with dispersion relations and speeds of sound .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after having reviewed the definitions in section 2 we found it necessary to remind the reader results of our last paper @xcite concerning the phase diagram . in the same section the dispersion relations for all sectors with infinite fermi zones only are compared . in section 4",
    "we present the calculations for the speeds of sound obtained either by power expansion or wiener - hopf technique for small or large fermi radii respectively .",
    "our conclusions are contained in section 5 .",
    "some useful definitions are compiled in an appendix .",
    "we refer the reader to papers @xcite and @xcite for the basics of the model .",
    "our hamiltonian of a spin chain of length @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 with the two couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 is limited to @xmath8 .",
    "for convenience we repeat the bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) , the magnon energies and momenta and the spin projection . @xmath9",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12",
    "in section 4 of @xcite we have carried out the complete analysis of the ground state structure based on the solution of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .",
    "we will now review the main results .    using different sets of special anisotropy points we were able to prove that ( for @xmath8 ) only three kinds of strings occur in the ground state .",
    "the picture changes remarkably at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "all possible sectors are compiled in table 1 taken from @xcite . to keep our notation consistent",
    "we found it useful to call the sector already discussed in @xcite sector 0 .",
    ".[t]all sectors appearing in the phase diagram .",
    "upper indices indicate infinite and finite fermi zones . in the latter case ,",
    "the second index distinguishes , wether the filling starts at @xmath15 or @xmath16 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking at figure [ g2p5 ] one clearly sees two effects .",
    "first the two singularity lines at @xmath17 ( the vanishing of the @xmath18-strings ) and at @xmath19 ( the vanishing of the @xmath20-strings ) cause discontinuities for the speed of the remaining excitation .",
    "while the first line is universal for arbitrary @xmath7 , the second one is peculiar to @xmath14 . for other @xmath7",
    "that line is replaced by sectors i or iii .",
    "second one sees the two conformal points where two velocities intersect , one at @xmath21 and the other at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "our calculations in the previous section allow now to look closer at what happens for @xmath23 when the above mentioned singularity line is replaced by sector i. as far as the limits of sectors ii and iv are concerned the only change is that @xmath24 no longer vanishes at the border of sector iv .",
    "now we make use of equations ( [ sos5- ] ) , ( [ border]),([sos6 + ] ) and ( [ sos6- ] ) .",
    "they tell us first that both velocities must reach their maximum ( at different @xmath25 ) within sector i and second that there is ( at least one ) point of intersection in the same sector . in that point",
    "the finite size corrections must exhibit a rather simple structure like in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that there is no such effect in sector iii but a strict prove requires further calculations .",
    "in addition , our calculations show another interesting effect , at @xmath26 all velocities vanish .",
    "finally we remark that we expect the theory at @xmath14 and both velocities equal to be highly symmetric and of particular interest . up to",
    "now it is only known that its central charge is @xmath27 .",
    "we were not able to calculate the operator dimensions analytically , because contrary to what happened in case of paper @xcite it requires the knowledge of the dressed charge @xcite and hence the explicit factorization of the kernel .",
    "the authors would like to thank h. frahm for helpful discussions .",
