    "it is a remarkable fact that three gauge coupling constants of the su(3)@xmath10su(2 ) @xmath10u(1 ) theory meet at a very high energy scale @xmath11 gev in the supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model .",
    "the grand unified theory ( gut ) is the most manifest candidate to explain the unification of the three gauge coupling constants .",
    "the gut was considered as a necessary scheme to maintain the gauge - coupling unification up to the planck scale @xmath12 gev .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by witten some time ago @xcite that the fundamental scale can be much lower than the planck scale in the strongly coupled string ( m ) theory @xcite and the unification scale , @xmath11 gev , is regarded as the cut - off scale @xmath13 of the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "that is , the standard - model gauge interactions are directly unified with gravity without going through the gut phase .",
    "this new interpretation of gauge coupling unification has various phenomenological merits ; in particular , it does not suffer from the doublet ",
    "triplet splitting problem , unlike the susy gut , and it may provide a natural peccei  quinn axion @xcite to solve the strong cp problem since the effects of world - sheet instantons are expected to be suppressed in the strongly coupled string theories @xcite . in this new unification approach , however , yukawa coupling constants are free parameters and hence we need a principle to understand another success of the susy gut , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "the yukawa - coupling unification is the most well - known principle to explain it .",
    "thus , we assume the yukawa - coupling unification for the third family at the unification ( cut - off ) scale @xmath15 gev , and consider that the yukawa couplings for the first and second families receive easily large threshold effects from heavy particles at the cut - off scale , since their tree - level values themselves are small compared with the yukawa coupling constants for the third family .",
    "this interesting principle may be extended if there are right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this is because we may have another `` yukawa - coupling unification ( @xmath16 ) '' , where @xmath17 is the largest eigenvalue of the dirac mass yukawa coupling for the neutrino .",
    "recently , super - kamiokande experiments on atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite have presented very convincing evidence for the oscillation of @xmath18 to @xmath19 with a mass difference @xmath20  ev@xmath21 , which implies the largest mass of the neutrino to be @xmath22 ev , provided there is a mass hierarchy @xmath23 . if neutrinos are indeed massive , the seesaw mechanism  @xcite is the most natural framework to account for the smallness of neutrino masses , where the small masses are low - energy consequences of the presence of superheavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos are determined by the dirac mass term for neutrinos , @xmath24 .",
    "it is very interesting that the yukawa - coupling unification ( @xmath25 ) suggests the majorana mass @xmath26 of the right - handed neutrino to be @xmath27 gev , which is very close to the unification ( cut - off ) scale @xmath13 .    in the models with the yukawa - coupling unification @xmath28 , large lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) in the charged lepton sector",
    "is expected in the susy standard model , since the @xmath2 neutrino yukawa coupling is very large and it induces non - negligible mass splitting among sleptons through radiative corrections @xcite . in this letter",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of lfv processes assuming the yukawa - coupling unification ( @xmath29 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that all squarks and sleptons have a common susy - breaking soft mass at the unification scale @xmath30 gev taking the gravity - mediated susy breaking model .",
    "we show that the present experimental upper bound on @xmath31 decay already gives a stringent constraint on the mixing @xmath32 ( typically @xmath33 for @xmath8 ) .",
    "since the constraint is very severe , the models with the yukawa - coupling unification need an explanation ( e.g. symmetry ) for the smallness of @xmath34 . in the existing literature , this constraint has not been taken into account .",
    "therefore , most of the models with the yukawa - coupling unification should be subject to this new constraint .",
    "however , we also stress that the above intriguing principle , i.e. yukawa - coupling unification , is not yet ruled out .",
    "future improvement of the branching ratios for the lfv processes  @xcite will provide a more significant impact on the yukawa - coupling unification models , otherwise they will indeed be observed .",
    "furthermore , in most of the neutrino - mass models proposed so far , the mixing @xmath34 approximately equals the neutrino mixing @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise measurement of @xmath9 in future neutrino experiments  @xcite is very important , since the observation of non - zero @xmath9 together with the negative result of @xmath31 decay has a great potential to exclude a large class of susy standard models with the yukawa - coupling unification .",
    "first , we briefly review the susy standard model with right - handed neutrinos . introducing the right - handed neutrinos",
    ", we have the following superpotential in the lepton sector : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are right - handed charged leptons , lepton doublets and right - handed neutrinos , respectively . in this letter , without loss of generality , we take a basis where the charged - lepton yukawa couplings ( @xmath39 ) and right - handed neutrino masses , @xmath40 , are diagonalized .    assuming @xmath41 , we integrate out the right - handed neutrinos and obtain the following effective superpotential : @xmath42 after the electroweak symmetry breaking , neutrinos get tiny majorana masses : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a flavor-(mass- ) eigenstate of neutrinos .",
    "we also define lepton mixing matrices @xmath0 and @xmath48 , which diagonalize the neutrino yukawa matrix as follows : @xmath49 here the matrix @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 note that in general the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath45 is different from the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known , the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath45 is responsible for the neutrino - oscillation physics .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 , on the other hand , is important for the lfv processes , as we will see later .",
    "many models for fermion masses have been proposed so far , in order to accommodate a large mixing for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "it has been pointed out that without introducing a nontrivial structure in the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix , the large mixing for neutrinos and small mixings for quarks are naturally explained by a lopsided structure of the dirac mass matrices  @xcite . in this case , the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 possesses a large mixing , i.e. @xmath52",
    "o(1 ) . as we will see",
    ", the experimental limits on the lfv processes can put a stringent constraint on the mixing @xmath0 .",
    "we should also note that the neutrino mixing @xmath45 is approximately equal to the mixing matrix @xmath0 in many models  @xcite : @xmath53 in this class of models , neutrino oscillations and lfv phenomena are correlated .",
    "therefore , neutrino experiments , together with the lfv searches , will provide a significant constraint on the models .",
    "let us now discuss the lfv in the susy models with right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "non - zero neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath54 generate the lfv in left - handed slepton masses via the renormalization group ( rg ) effects , even if a common susy - breaking mass for all scalars is assumed at the unification ( cut - off ) scale @xmath13 .",
    "an approximate solution to the rg equation for masses responsible for lfv at the weak scale is given by @xmath55 here , we have assumed a common susy - breaking mass @xmath56 for all scalar bosons and a common a - term @xmath57 at the unification scale ( @xmath58 gev ) , and we have used eq .  ( [ dirac_mixing ] ) . note that the lfv masses @xmath59 depend on the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 rather than on the neutrino mixing @xmath45 .",
    "lfv processes @xmath6 and @xmath60 conversion in nuclei are induced by @xmath61 component through the slepton - mediated diagrams . assuming a hierarchical structure of the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath62 , which is similar to those for the charged - leptons and quarks , the dominant contribution is given by @xmath63 a branching ratio for @xmath6 decay is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a complicated function of the susy parameters .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .    in the models with the yukawa - coupling unification ,",
    "the @xmath2 neutrino yukawa coupling is unified into the top - quark yukawa coupling at @xmath13 .",
    "since the large neutrino yukawa coupling induces large lfv masses in the slepton sector  @xcite , the event rates for lfv processes can be significantly large .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    "( [ lfv_slepton ] ) , the event rates for @xmath6 process depend on @xmath66 and @xmath34 components of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino results indicate that the lepton sector has a large mixing between the second and third generations .",
    "especially if the large mixing for atmospheric neutrinos originates from the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 , the component @xmath66 has a nearly maximal mixing , @xmath67 , and hence it further enhances the lfv . for example , the neutrino - mass models with lopsided froggatt ",
    "nielsen ( fn ) u(1 ) charges in ref .",
    "@xcite possess a large mixing in @xmath66 , as shown in fig.[v_lepton ] .",
    "in many of the existing models  @xcite , the almost maximal mixing comes from the lepton mixing @xmath66 as listed in table  [ list ] .",
    ".typical predicted values for @xmath66 , @xmath34 , and @xmath9 in various models  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , the searches for lfv can either constrain , or unveil , such a large lepton mixing , @xmath32 , which can not be probed by neutrino - oscillation physics .    in our analysis",
    ", we numerically solve the rg equations and use the complete formula in ref .",
    "@xcite for a calculation of the @xmath6 branching ratio .",
    "we fix the heaviest neutrino mass to be @xmath68 ev in order to determine the right - handed neutrino mass scale ( @xmath69 gev ) .    in fig .",
    "[ exclude ] , we present our numerical result , which shows an upper bound on @xmath32 from the current limit on the branching ratio for @xmath70 , br@xmath71 , assuming a wino mass @xmath72 to be 150 gev , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath4 is the yukawa coupling for the top quark at the unification scale @xmath13 . here",
    ", we do not impose the exact bottom - tau yukawa unification at @xmath13 , but a milder unification ( @xmath75 with 20% deviations )  @xcite is adopted .",
    "( @xmath76 )  @xcite . in this case , the constraint on @xmath77 is more stringent , since the event rate for @xmath6 is nearly proportional to @xmath78 . ]    in order to obtain a conservative bound on @xmath32 , we have neglected sub - dominant contributions in the lfv slepton masses in eq .",
    "( [ lfv_slepton ] ) , which are proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 . is equal to zero , even the sub - dominant contributions are important . for details , see ref .",
    "] moreover , since the branching ratio for @xmath81 is approximately proportional to @xmath78 , we took a small @xmath82 ( @xmath73 ) in fig .",
    "[ exclude ] .",
    "therefore , our result in fig .  [ exclude ] should be considered as a very conservative one .",
    "our result is also applicable to gut models with the yukawa - coupling unification @xmath74 . in the gut models ,",
    "the rg running from the planck scale to the unification scale also induces the lfv in slepton masses .",
    "therefore the constraint would be more stringent in general , unless there are accidental cancellations between the two contributions below and above the gut scale , although the gut contribution depends on a detail of the model  @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ exclude ] , the current limit on the br(@xmath70 ) can put a severe bound on @xmath32 ; typically the limit is @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath83 gev . without any symmetry",
    ", such a small value of @xmath34 would be very unnatural . actually as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ v_lepton ] and table  [ list ] , many of the existing models are already strongly constrained or excluded .",
    "furthermore , the future @xmath6 experiment  @xcite with a sensitivity of @xmath84 in the branching ratio will bring down the limit of @xmath34 to @xmath85 for @xmath8 and @xmath83 gev , and hence it will be able to test the models with yukawa - coupling unification .",
    "in addition to the @xmath81 process , @xmath60 conversion in nuclei is also important .",
    "a ratio between the branching ratio for @xmath81 and the @xmath60 conversion rate is given by @xmath86 in almost the entire parameter space of the models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the future meco experiment  @xcite for @xmath60 conversion in al , with a sensitivity of @xmath87 , and a further future project , with a sensitivity of @xmath88 ( _ e.g. _ prism  @xcite for @xmath60 conversion in ti ) will also provide a robust probe on the models ; otherwise the lfv phenomena will be observed . , where the event rate depends on the different matrix elements ( @xmath66 and @xmath89 ) , gives a different information on the parameters ( see ref .",
    "]    we should stress that even if @xmath66 is smaller than the maximal mixing @xmath90 , the constraint does not change much unless it is extremely small .",
    "for example , a factor of 2 smaller value of @xmath66 gives only a factor of 2 weaker limit on @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we comment on a connection between neutrino oscillation and lfv . as we mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "it is very likely in many models that the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath45 equals the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 approximately ( see eq .",
    "( [ same ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , a precise measurement of neutrino mixing @xmath9 in future neutrino experiments  @xcite would be very important , since the observation of non - zero @xmath9 could be in conflict with the constraint from the lfv processes .",
