    "in recent years a very significant effort , both experimentally and theoretically , has been made to determine the symmetry of the pairing state@xcite in high temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) .",
    "it is usually held that such an identification would provide significant clues towards a better understanding of the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconductivity .",
    "the symmetry properties of the pairing state itself , being connected to those of the superconducting energy gap , have important physical and technological implications .",
    "there is a large body of experimental results , supported by theoretical work , that is generally interpreted as indicative of a pairing state at least predominantly of the @xmath4-wave type @xcite , ( although there are experiments@xcite which are difficult to interpret in that framework . ) by this , it is meant a pairing state which has an order parameter ( op ) which vanishes , or nearly so , along four lines on the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the angle between such lines of nodes ( or `` quasinodes '' ) is presumed to be near @xmath5 , but , because of the orthorhombic symmetry of htsc materials ( as exemplified by the strong anisotropy of superconducting properties@xcite in the @xmath1 plane ) this is unlikely to be precisely correct .",
    "pairing states of different tetragonal symmetry , such as @xmath4- or @xmath6-wave , could mix .",
    "several proposals , mostly incorporating a predominantly @xmath4-wave op , have been set forth to describe this mixing@xcite .",
    "some of them include op s of different symmetry near the surface than in the bulk@xcite .",
    "many of the best probes of the op give information only on the pairing state within a few correlation lengths from the surface , which might differ from the bulk state .",
    "thus , large uncertainties exist .    the aim of this paper is to show that nonlinear electromagnetic phenomena@xcite can provide a systematic way to distinguish op s of different symmetries , or of mixed symmetry .",
    "we will show how the nonlinear electrodynamic effects in the meissner regime , which are due to the presence of nodes or small minima in the superconducting gap , can be used to perform `` node spectroscopy '' , that is , to determine the angular position of any lines on the fs where the absolute value of the op is very small or zero , and the value of the op at these lines .",
    "further , the bulk character of these effects ( they extend over a length on the order of the penetration depth rather than the much smaller coherence length ) means that these determinations would refer to the bulk , and can become very useful in avoiding material imperfections near the surface and other difficulties of the surface probes .",
    "we concentrate in this work on the nonlinear magnetic moment as a sensitive probe for the superconducting gap symmetry .",
    "in particular , we examine its transverse component ( perpendicular to the applied field , which lies in the @xmath1 plane ) which is determined by the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "other quantities , such as the penetration depth , might also be used for the same purpose , and will be referred to briefly .",
    "the transverse moment , however , can be readily measured either directly or through the torque it produces , and , as shown in ref .",
    ", its size for typical samples is large enough to be detected . at temperatures",
    "much below the critical temperature , the excitations responsible for the nonlinear meissner effect are energetically favorable only near the nodes or quasinodes of the fs . the spectroscopy method described in this paper , provides an accurate positioning of the nodes in the energy gap and not just information about their presence .",
    "similarly we show that even in the absence of nodes , the presence of `` quasinodes '' would lead to several distinctive features in the angular and field dependence of the nonlinear magnetic moment .",
    "we will examine various pairing states that are compatible with the crystal symmetry , including leading candidates for the pairing state of htsc materials , and excluding only the pure @xmath4-wave state which we have extensively discussed elsewhere@xcite . in our notation for the pairing states , we shall follow the discussion from refs . .",
    "we start with the spin singlet pairing states in a square @xmath7 lattice as given in table [ table1 ] . for the @xmath8 family of cuprates ,",
    "the orthorhombic crystal distortion amounts to a simple change in the length of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 crystallographic constants .",
    "therefore@xcite the admissible mixing of op s include combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath6 , or of @xmath12 and @xmath13 symmetries only .",
    "the nodes of the gap function are not necessarily at an angle @xmath14 from the crystallographic axes , and do not in general form an angle of @xmath5 .",
    "for the @xmath15 family the situation is different@xcite .",
    "the distortion occurs in such a way that the new orthorhombic axes form an angle of @xmath14 with the original tetragonal axes .",
    "the relevant mixing is then between @xmath13 and @xmath6 or between @xmath11 and @xmath12 symmetries .",
    "the nodes are at the orthorhombic axes and , as in the pure @xmath4-wave case , the directions along which they occur form angles of @xmath5 . in the following sections",
    ", we shall use these considerations to choose the gap functions to be studied .    in section",
    "ii we discuss methods to solve the nonlinear maxwell - equations in the meissner regime to compute the physical quantities of interest .",
    "the general procedure we use exploits the fact , proved in ref .",
    "( see particularly fig .",
    "5 there ) that the angular dependence of the transverse magnetic moment for a typical finite sample ( a flat crystal ) can be very accurately computed by assuming that the sample is infinite in the @xmath1 plane , while the overall amplitude is underestimated somewhat by this assumption . since , as we shall see , the nodal structure is directly reflected in the angular dependences , we can proceed for our purposes here by considering a simple `` slab '' geometry .",
    "this allows us to do the entire work analytically , treating the small nonlinear effects perturbatively .",
    "we illustrate our perturbation method in section ii by considering first a superconducting gap with mixed @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "various additional gap functions , with nodes , are studied in section iii .",
    "we show how to include the effects of orthorhombic distortion as they affect both normal ( fs shape ) and superconducting ( penetration depth tensor ) properties , in the calculation of the nonlinear effects . in section",
    "iv we consider gaps without nodes in contrast with the corresponding results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "we propose several ways that would allow to experimentally distinguish nodes from small minima in the superconducting gap . in the last section",
    "we give our conclusions and possible guidelines for the future work .",
    "we briefly review here the nonlinear maxwell - london equations@xcite that need to be solved for superconductors with various pairing states . for a @xmath4 wave infinite superconductor ,",
    "these nonlinear equations have been solved , perturbatively@xcite at zero temperature , or numerically@xcite when finite systems or temperatures have been considered .    here we are concerned with node spectroscopy , that is , with the effect that a pattern of nodes ( or deep dips ) in the angular dependence of the op has on the dependence of the nonlinear meissner effect on the angle between applied field and sample orientation . for this purpose",
    "we can work at @xmath16 since it was shown@xcite that at the temperatures @xmath17 and field ranges experiments are performed , the @xmath16 result is sufficiently accurate .",
    "similarly , we can work in a simple `` infinite slab '' geometry ( as defined below ) since it is known@xcite that finite size effects , while changing the amplitude of the nonlinear phenomena to some extent , do not affect their angular dependence .",
    "we will , therefore , develop a zero temperature perturbation methods , for a simple geometry , that can be used with a wide variety of pairing states .",
