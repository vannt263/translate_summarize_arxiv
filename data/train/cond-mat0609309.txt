    "thermoelectric properties of hybrid normal - metal / superconductor ( n / s ) structures are strongly modified by the superconducting proximity effect ( see refs .   for review ) .",
    "it was predicted that at low temperatures the thermopower in mesoscopic n / s structures can be as much as 1000 times larger than that in normal metals.@xcite moreover , the thermopower acquires a phase - coherent part as was first observed in ref .  , where thermopower oscillations as a function of superconducting phase difference @xmath0 were recorded in a geometry of an andreev intereferometer ( a superconducting loop connected to a normal part , see review@xcite for details ) . according to theory,@xcite",
    "this oscillating part of thermopower should be antisymmetric in @xmath0 and have reentrance in temperature dependence with a maximum at the thouless energy , similar to that of magnetoresistance .",
    "is determined from the distance @xmath1 between the superconductors , and in the latter case from the distance of the superconductors to the normal terminals . ]",
    "the value of thermopower at the maximum can reach a few @xmath2v / k .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in quantitative measurements of thermopower,@xcite where local thermometry technique based on proximity resistance@xcite was used , the value of only 100nv / k was reported , considerably less than that predicted by theory . while the above qualitative behavior has been observed in several experiments , some deviations from it",
    "have been reported as well .",
    "in particular , large thermopower symmetric in @xmath0 has been observed,@xcite which is not explained by theory .",
    "close to the supercondicting transition of the superconducting parts of hybrid mesoscopic ns junctions , a thermopower due to quasiparticle thermoelectric currents has been reported.@xcite however , the value of the thermopower observed near @xmath3 in these experiments was considerably larger than that predicted by theory.@xcite in structures consisting of a normal ring with only one superconducting contact a small thermopower periodic and symmetric with respect to magnetic flux through the normal ring has been reported.@xcite recently , thermal conductivity of andreev interferometers has been studied as well , see refs .  .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the effect of supercurrents flowing through the normal part of the andreev interferometer , which were first highlighted in ref .  .",
    "we designed our structure so that the supercurrent can be created by an applied magnetic flux through the superconducting loop or directly from an external power supply using extra superconducting contacts .",
    "the results are compared with the predictions from the quasiclassical theory .",
    "the samples were fabricated using two - stage e - beam lithography .",
    "first , a normal part was made of a thermally evaporated 30 nm thick ag film .",
    "then the second layer was made of 55 nm thick al film used as a superconductor . to obtain clean interfaces between the layers ,",
    "the contact area was @xmath4 plasma etched before the deposition of the second layer .",
    "this @xmath5 etching process produces interface resistance less than 1 @xmath6 for contact area of 100 nm @xmath7 200 nm . figure 1 shows the geometry of one of the measured samples .",
    "the sample consists of an @xmath8-shaped n wire connected to a superconducting loop with two s contacts , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and to superconducting contacts @xmath11 and @xmath12 . on the left side",
    ", the n structure is connected to a small normal reservoir ( which we will call a quasi - reservoir ) , which in turn is connected to two superconductor electrodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 . by passing current from @xmath13 to @xmath14",
    "we were able to vary the temperature of the quasi - reservoir .",
    "on the right side the n structure is connected to a normal reservoir , which is in good thermal contact with massive au pads so that its temperature is fixed by the substrate .",
    "measurements were performed in a he@xmath15 cryostat at temperatures from 0.28 k to 1.5 k with a magnetic field up to 1 mt applied perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "resistivity , @xmath16 , of the ag film was about 2 @xmath17 cm with diffusion constants , @xmath18 , about 130 @xmath19/s .",
    "magnetoresistance measurements were performed using conventional ac bridge technique .",
    "thermopower measurements have been done using two different methods . in the first method ,",
    "a heating current , @xmath20 , was a sum of dc and 0.5@xmath21 ac currents and it was applied between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "thermovoltage , @xmath22 , between @xmath10 and @xmath23 was measured using a lock - in amplifier on the frequency of the ac signal . in the second method , only ac current at the frequency @xmath24 was applied to the heater but the signal was measured by the lock - in amplifier at the frequency 2@xmath24 .",
    "a superconducting magnet was used to sweep a magnetic field .",
    "zero of magnetic field on all graphs corresponds to zero current through the magnet . since there was a small shift due to magnetic field of the earth , the relative phase of thermopower and magnetoresistance oscillations was double checked by repeated measurements to ensure they were measured with the same reference point .",
    "nonequilibrium electrical properties of diffusive superconductor  normal - metal heterostructures can be described with the quasiclassical keldysh - usadel theory.@xcite we model the experimental sample by a system of quasi - one - dimensional wires connected to each other at nodes , see fig .",

    "the primary object to be described is the keldysh green s function , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the retarded , advanced and keldysh green functions , @xmath29 describes two degrees of freedom of the distribution function , and @xmath30 is the @xmath31:the pauli matrix .",

    "symbols with a `` check '' ( such as @xmath35 ) are chosen to represent matrices in the keldysh space , and symbols with a `` hat '' ( @xmath36 ) are matrices in the nambu space .",

    "this form is valid in a normal metal where the superconducting order parameter @xmath47 vanishes .",
    "the first leakage term describes the dissociation of cooper pairs entering a normal metal , and it gives the finite penetration depth @xmath48 for the proximity effect .",
    "the second term @xmath49 describes inelastic scattering due to , for example , electron - electron or electron - phonon interaction . in what follows",
    ", we assume that the latter term is finite only in the electrodes and vanishes inside the wires .",
    "the matrix currents flowing at different wires are connected via the nodal conditions : the sum of the currents @xmath50 flowing into each node vanishes and the functions @xmath35 are continuous across each node .    for the numerics ,",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the retarded and advanced green s function by the complex parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , such that    @xmath53    here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the complex conjugates of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . with this parametrization , eq .",

    "finally , in the reservoirs the green functions tend into the bulk functions of those reservoirs . for retarded / advanced parts in the absence of magnetic field",
    "this means @xmath67 or @xmath68 in a normal metal and they tend to @xmath69 in a superconductor with the superconducting order parameter @xmath70 , with @xmath71 or @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    the reservoir values for the distribution functions @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the potential and @xmath77 is the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "there is one exception : for energies below the superconducting gap , andreev reflection forbids the energy current into a superconductor .",
    "therefore , there the dirichlet boundary condition of @xmath78 is changed into the vanishing of the energy current , @xmath79 into all superconductors .    if one would like to describe the behavior of the superconducting order parameter @xmath47 in the superconducting parts of the structure , a self - consistency equation connecting @xmath47 with the solution @xmath80 could be applied . however , in what follows we assume that all the superconductors are reservoirs , such that @xmath47 obtains its bulk value quickly near the ns boundary .",
    "such an assumption works fairly well for our system , but it brings some inaccuracy to the exact position of the ns interface as the inverse proximity effect suppresses @xmath47 and @xmath51 close to the interface .",
    "generally these quantities have a healing length of the order of the superconducting coherence length , @xmath81 .",
    "another consequence of assuming that the superconductors are reservoirs is a boundary condition @xmath82 at the normal - superconducting interface . for energies below the gap",
    ", @xmath59 decays into the superconductors within @xmath83 , but above the gap , the decay length is much longer , of the order of the charge relaxation length inside the superconductors.@xcite the validity of this assumption may thus be questionable at high temperatures , where thermal quasiparticles inside superconductors play a role . to simulate the effect of a very long charge relaxation length , we replaced the dirichlet boundary condition for the distribution functions at @xmath84 with a neumann condition @xmath85 .",
    "this then takes into account the charge - imbalance voltage due to the quasiparticle current entering the superconductor , assuming the detailed form of charge relaxation can be neglected .",
    "compared to the dirichlet condition , this condition results in our geometry to a slightly reduced thermopower at high temperatures , where thermal quasiparticles play a role .",
    "equations and together with the nodal and boundary conditions need in general to be solved numerically .",
    "when the solutions to them are found , one can obtain , for example , the observable energy and charge currents flowing in wire @xmath31 from @xmath86 the current conservation and kirchoff laws for these currents follow naturally from the corresponding laws for @xmath87 .",
    "is fixed by current conservation , @xmath88 ; for a left - right symmetric system @xmath89 .",
    "the phase @xmath90 can be controlled by the flux through the superconducting loop , and @xmath91 by the applied supercurrent between the contacts s@xmath92 and s@xmath93.,width=302 ]    the numerical results presented in the remainder of this text have been obtained by solving the above equations without further approximations .",
    "we model the experimental setup with the schematic system presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , where seven quasi - one - dimensional wires are connected to each other and to two normal - metal and four superconducting reservoirs .",

    "as the parameters for the wires 6 and 7 could not be separately measured , we assume the system symmetric with respect to the inversion around the around the axis lying along wires 1 , 5 , and 2 .",
    "in all the numerical curves , we use the same set of parameters , and fit only the diffusion constant @xmath18 and the self - inductance @xmath1 of the superconducting loop , see below .",
    "we aim to calculate two separately measured observables for the same measured structure : the critical supercurrent @xmath109 between the superconductors s@xmath92 and s@xmath93 and the thermopower @xmath110 between reservoir 2 and the superconductors .    as shown for example in refs .  , the presence of the spectral supercurrent and the anomalous kinetic coefficient in eqs",

    "the theory predicts a reentrant thermopower , with the maximum slightly above the thouless energy .",
    "this is below the maximum point @xmath200 k found in the experiments . increasing the thouless energy in the simulations would lead to an improved fit of the peak position ( see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : qvst ] ) , but then the critical current data can not be understood . in the presence of screening ( finite @xmath1 ) , at the lowest temperatures the phase does not reach the point where the maximum thermopower would be obtained , and thus the resulting thermopower is reduced , and the position of the maximum thermopower is slightly shifted to the right .",
    "however , to get the maximum near the experimentally observed value , a much larger value of @xmath1 would be needed , and in this case the calculated @xmath201 is much wider than in the experiments .",
    "k and different values of the inductance : @xmath160 ( solid line ) , @xmath161 ph ( dashed line ) , and @xmath202 ph ( dash - dotted line ) . for comparison ,",
    "similar data calculated for @xmath203 k and @xmath160 is plotted as a dotted line.,height=288 ]    in the geometry of our experiment the effect of supercurrent can be measured directly .",
    "figure [ fig : qvsis ] shows the dependence of thermovoltage on magnetic field measured at different values of dc current between contacts @xmath11-@xmath12 . at small currents an extra shift in thermovoltage occurs .",
    "the precise shift depends on the ratio of the supercurrents entering the loop and flowing in the central wire .",
    "according to the simulations , the previous dominates at the temperatures where the measurements were made , and as a result the phase shift is close to @xmath204 .    measuring @xmath195 as a function of @xmath205 at @xmath8 = 0 showed linear dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vvsis ] and eq .  ) . at higher values of current through @xmath11-@xmath12 the total current in the central n - wire ( applied dc current plus screening current due to magnetic flux ) exceeds the value of critical current of this part ( @xmath206 , see fig .",
    "4 ) . in this case",
    "a dc voltage will appear between thermovoltage probes s1-n1 , which is also temperature dependent .",
    "since temperature is modulated at the frequency @xmath24 , so is the above constant voltage , leading to an extra contribution to signal measured by lock - in amplifier .",
    "let us concentrate on the linear response to @xmath205 .",
    "the effect of @xmath205 can be estimated using eq .",
    "( 13 ) . assuming the supercurrent - phase relation in the n wire is not strongly temperature dependent",
    ", we have @xmath207f@xmath208 , where f@xmath209 sin@xmath208 , eq .  ( 13 ) can be rewritten as @xmath210 substituting @xmath211 = 8.7 @xmath2a / k at @xmath77 = 0.28 k found from fig .",
    "[ fig : icvst ] into ( 18 ) we get @xmath199 = 2.5 @xmath2v / k for @xmath205 = 3 @xmath2a . comparing with experimental data we have @xmath212 = 20 nv at @xmath186 = 5 @xmath2a and @xmath187 = 0.5 @xmath2a , which corresponds to @xmath199 = 0.7 @xmath2v / k .",

    "blue : magnetic field corresponds to a zero flux through the @xmath213 loop .",
    "red : magnetic field corresponds to a half flux quantum.,height=288 ]",
    "we have explored the dependence of the thermopower of an andreev interferometer on supercurrents created by magnetic field and applied directly from external power supply .",
    "the experimental thermopower was modelled theoretically using the numerical calculations with the actual geometry and fitting only the thouless energy corresponding to the distance between the superconductors .",
    "we find that the thermovoltage oscillates as a function of the magnetic flux through the superconducting loop .",
    "the shape of these oscillations can be well described by the theory once the loop inductance is taken into account .",
    "the theory predicts correct order of magnitude for the thermopower .",
    "however , the calculated temperature dependence does not fit experimental data .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to the experimental error in calculating @xmath199 due to the ambiguity in determination of true temperature difference across the interferometer using only one thermometer in the middle of the structure as opposed to two separate thermometers at hot and cold ends of the interferometer .",
    "another possible reason is a complicated geometry with its extra superconducting electrodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in addition to the @xmath213 loop , and especially the ambiguity in determining the parameters for the sample geometry .",
    "the effect of supercurrent has been measured directly using extra superconducting electrodes .",
    "the experimental dependence is linear in agreement with theory .",
    "the absolute value of thermopower due to this supercurrent found experimentally is smaller than that predicted by theory .",
    "this dicrepancy may at least partially be attributed to a more complicated relation between @xmath199 and @xmath205 due to the presence of the s loop . when both externally applied supercurrent and screening current due to magnetic flux through the @xmath213 loop are present , the situation becomes more complicated ( see red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : vvsis ] ) .",
    "in particular , when the total current approaches the critical value of the @xmath163 wire , the dependence of the thermovoltage on @xmath205 becomes strongly nonlinear .",
    "this can not be accounted for completely by only the above mentioned extra contribution to measured signal .",
    "this case will be discussed in detail elsewhere .    when @xmath214 , the quasi - reservoir is heated locally so that its distribution function is close to equilibrium .",
    "the main heat transport channel is through the @xmath163-wire into @xmath163 reservoir , so that in this regime the temperature gradient is well defined .",
    "we concentrated on this regime to compare obtained results with the theoretical calculations . when @xmath215 ( or when the heater electrodes made of a normal metal ) heater contacts turn normal and the quasi - reservoir distribution function has a nonequilibrium form due to a long energy relaxation length in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "the measurements in this regime will be reported elsewhere .",
