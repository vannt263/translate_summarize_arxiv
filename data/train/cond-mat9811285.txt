    "it is known that the electron - hole symmetry is peculiar to the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "one of manifestations of this symmetry is the equivalence of the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "it is the result of an equality of hopping integrals describing both `` translational '' hoping of holes and doubly occupied sites ( doublons ) and the processes of their paired creation and destruction . equality of noted hopping integrals is caused by neglecting the matrix elements of electron - electron interaction @xmath3 in the general hamiltonian ( the matrix elements  ( 1 ) describe hopping of electrons between @xmath4 and @xmath5 lattice sites ; @xmath6-function is the wannier function ) .",
    "however , theoretical analysis , on the one hand , and available experimental data , on the other hand , point out the fact that the hubbard model generalization by taking into account correlated hopping  ( 1 ) is of principle necessary  @xcite  @xcite . in such model hopping integrals describing `` translational '' hopping of holes and doublons are different .",
    "these hopping integrals also differ from the hopping integral which is connected with the processes of paired creation and destruction of holes and doublons . in consequence of that",
    "the lower and upper hubbard bands are non - equivalent ( non - symmetric ) . in recent years similar models have been studied intensively  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "important puzzle arising in an investigation of these models is metal - insulator transition problem which is one of the most essential in narrow - band in this connection special interest is challenged by the observable metal - to - insulator transitions in some narrow - band materials with the increase of temperature ( see , for example  @xcite ",
    "@xcite ) .    on the basis of an approach proposed in the papers  @xcite we have studied metal - insulator transition in a model of narrow - band material with non - equivalent hubbard subbands ( so - called `` non - symmetric hubbard model '' ) at half - filling and zero temperature in the paper  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a further study of metal - insulator transition in a model with non - equivalent hubbard subbands , in particular , an investigation of temperature - induced metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "we start from the following natural generalization of the hubbard model  @xcite at half - filling including correlated hopping  ( 1 ) @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the chemical potential , @xmath9 is the creation ( destruction ) operator of an electron of spin @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) on @xmath4-site ( @xmath12 denotes spin projection which is opposite to @xmath10 ) , @xmath13 is the number operator of electrons of spin @xmath10 on @xmath4-site , @xmath0 is the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion , @xmath14 are the integrals of electron hopping between nearest neighbors , @xmath15 the primes at the sums in hamiltonian  ( 2 ) signify that @xmath16 .    using a generalized mean - field approximation  @xcite in green function method",
    "we obtain for a paramagnetic state the single - particle energy spectrum as  @xcite @xmath17 ^ 2 + ( 4dt'_{\\bf k})^2},\\quad b=1 - 2d+4d^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the wave vector , @xmath19 are the energies of electrons within the lower ( upper ) hubbard band , @xmath20 is the concentration of polar states ( holes or doublons ) , @xmath21 are the fourier transforms of respective hopping integrals @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are terms describing hopping of quasiparticles within the lower and upper hubbard bands ( hopping of holes and doublons ) respectively , @xmath25 describes quasiparticle hopping between hole and doublon bands ( the processes of paired creation and destruction of holes and doublons ) .    note",
    "that single - particle energy spectrum  ( 3 ) gives the exact atomic and band limits : if @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( neglecting correlated hopping ) then @xmath28 take the band form , if @xmath29 then we obtain exact atomic limit .    with the help of single - particle energy spectrum  ( 3 ) we find the expression to calculate the energy gap width ( difference of energies between bottom of the upper and top of the lower hubbard bands ) : @xmath30 ^ 2+(4dzt')^2},\\\\   & & q_2=\\sqrt{\\left [ b(w-\\tilde{w})+u\\right]^2+(4dzt')^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are halfwidths of the lower ( hole ) and upper ( doublon ) hubbard bands : @xmath33 (",
    "@xmath34 is the number of nearest neighbors to a site ) .    at given @xmath35 and change of @xmath20 ( which can be caused by external influences , in particular , by temperature )",
    "energy gap  ( 5 ) vanishes when the condition @xmath36 is satisfied where @xmath37 is the root of the equation @xmath38 then a metallic state ( @xmath39 ) is realized at @xmath36 , an insulating state ( @xmath40 ) is realized at @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 ( the hubbard model ) then energy gap  ( 5 ) takes the following form  @xcite : @xmath43 and vanishes when the condition @xmath36 is satisfied where @xmath44    from eq .",
    "( 8) we obtain the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath45 ratio ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 characterize value of correlated hopping . from fig .  1",
    "one can see that value of @xmath37 depends on the parameters of correlated hopping @xmath47 ( thus on @xmath48 ) weakly when @xmath45 is near zero .",
    "but with the increase of @xmath45 the value of @xmath37 begins to depend strongly on the parameters @xmath47 .",
    "1 points out the extension of region in which narrow - band material is a metal with the increase of @xmath48 ratio ( at given @xmath45 ) .",
    "the concentration of polar states ( obtained with the help of the green function @xmath49 ) is  @xcite @xmath50d\\varepsilon\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 and chemical potential of narrow - band model with non - equivalent hubbard subbands is given by the equation @xmath52d\\varepsilon=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath53 are obtained from respective formulae  ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) for @xmath54 by substitution of @xmath55 .",
    "here we have used the rectangular density of states @xmath56 where @xmath57 if @xmath58 otherwise ; @xmath59 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the temperature dependence of chemical potential of a narrow - band model with non - equivalent hubbard subbands obtained from eq .",
    "( 12 ) is plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "one can see that in the considered model in the region of low and normal temperatures chemical potential is essentially dependent not only on the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 and also on temperature ( in contrast to the hubbard model where @xmath60 ) , and what is more with the decrease of temperature chemical potential rapidly increases depending on the paramaters of non - equivalence of hubbard bands @xmath47 .",
    "in high temperature region in the proposed model chemical potential tends to @xmath61 with the increase of temperature ; really , at @xmath62 the probabilities of an electron finding within the lower and upper hubbard bands ( independently of their bandwidths ratio ) are equal .    at given @xmath63 ( constant exterior pressure ) concentration of polar states  ( 11 )",
    "increases with the increase of temperature .",
    "it leads to the fact that system can undergo transition from the state with @xmath39 to the state with @xmath40 , i.e. metal - to - insulator transition can occur . in this case the results obtained in the hubbard model and those obtained in non - symmetric hubbard model",
    "can be essentially different ( fig .",
    "3 illustrates it ) .",
    "let us take for example @xmath64 .",
    "one can see that at @xmath65 the energy gap width in both models is @xmath66 ( a metallic state )",
    ". with the increase of temperature metal - to - insulator transition does not occur in the hubbard model , in non - symmetric model the values of parameters @xmath47 exist at which metal - to - insulator transition occurs .    in case",
    "metal - to - insulator transition occurs in both models from fig .  3",
    "one can see that at given values of @xmath45 in model with non - equivalent hubbard subbands metal - to - insulator transition occurs at smaller temperature than in the hubbard model .",
    "so , for example , for @xmath67  ev ( such bandwidth of nis@xmath68 was estimated in paper  @xcite ) in considered model in a paramagnetic state metal - to - insulator transition occurs at @xmath69  k for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( observable the transition temperature of nis@xmath68 is @xmath72  k at @xmath73  mpa  @xcite ) . for the same value of @xmath2 metal - to - insulator transition",
    "occurs at @xmath74  k when @xmath75 ( neglecting of correlated hopping , the hubbard model ) and at @xmath76  k when @xmath77 . if @xmath78 then transition from a metallic state to an insulating state is realized at @xmath79  k for @xmath75 ; at @xmath76  k when @xmath80 .",
    "note that at @xmath81 the temperatures of metal - to - insulator transiton found in both models are essentially different ; with a deviation from this ratio the difference decreases .",
    "the obtained temperature dependence of energy gap can explain observable transition from the state of a paramagnetic metal to the paramagnetic mott - hubbard insulator state in the ( v@xmath82cr@xmath83)@xmath68o@xmath84 compound  @xcite , @xcite in nis@xmath68  @xcite and in the nis@xmath85se@xmath83 system  @xcite with the increase of temperature .    in summary , metal - to - insulator transition observable in the materials with narrow energy bands",
    "can be explained on the basis of the proposed approach at realistic values of the parameters characterizing non - equivalence of the hubbard subbands . in this way series of results obtained from such consideration",
    "are essentially distinct from those obtained without taking into account this non - equivalence ( the hubbard model ) . in particular , the temperature of metal - to - insulator transition is essentially smaller than in the hubbard model ( this fact agrees to the observable transition temperature ) , and chemical potential disctinguishes from the value @xmath60 ( obtained in the hubbard model ) and is temperature dependent .",
