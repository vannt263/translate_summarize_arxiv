    "recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the relaxation of a bosonic condensate in interaction with its quantum and/or thermal fluctuations .",
    "some of the main results of this research program have been obtained in the description of the inflationary dynamics , where one has to consider the expectation value of a scalar field rolling down towards equilibrium . since",
    "similar scalar theories can be used to describe the low energy features of hadronic physics ( like the interaction among pions ) , this subject has been studied also in connection with the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) , which may happen after the collision of two ultrarelativistic nuclei .",
    "thus , much work has been done about the quantum evolution out of equilibrium of the @xmath4 model in @xmath6 dimensions @xcite . as is well known @xcite , the renormalized theory",
    "trivial_. practically , this means that we should consider the model as an effective theory , keeping the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath7 much smaller than some landau scale .",
    "the logarithmic dependence on @xmath7 should disappear from the renormalized quantities , while a weak inverse power dependence remains .",
    "if we want to push the application of non equilibrium techniques to more fundamental theories , like qcd , we should consider that the ultraviolet properties change drastically . in those cases ,",
    "in fact , there is no landau pole in the ultraviolet and the renormalized coupling becomes smaller and smaller as the momentum scale increases .",
    "this corresponds to the property of asymptotic freedom , whose presence justifies self  consistently the perturbative renormalization procedure and allows in principle to perform the infinite cut - off limit smoothly .    motivated by this consideration and by its intrinsic relevance both in quantum field theory and in statistical mechanics , we analyse in this paper the dynamical properties of the nonlinear @xmath1 model in @xmath2 dimensions , which is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet @xcite . thus , @xmath7 can be pushed to infinity rigorously and there should exist a renormalized out  of  equilibrium dynamics , completely independent of the ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the linear and nonlinear @xmath1 models in @xmath6 dimensions were introduced in elementary particle theory in order to provide a useful model of the low  energy strong interaction sector , which was able to realize the @xmath8 current algebra and the partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) and satisfy the corresponding low energy theorems @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the nonlinear @xmath1 model has been considered fruitfully in many areas of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics , mainly in the description of quantum spin chains and @xmath9 spin models @xcite and , quite recently , of disordered conductors and of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "we consider in this paper the @xmath10 invariant model , in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "first of all , we present in section [ eveq ] an original derivation of the relevant result that the large @xmath3 limit and the large coupling limit , which turns the linear model in the nonlinear one , commute .",
    "more precisely , we show that the same _ classical _ ( in the sense of yaffe @xcite ) hamiltonian , which describes the quantum dynamics of the model in the large @xmath3 approximation , is obtained , no matter in which order we perform the two limits .",
    "previous studies on this subject were presented in @xcite , using perturbative techniques and the derivative expansion for the model in 3 + 1 dimensions , with the conclusion that the divergent terms are universal , while finite parts do differ when taking the large coupling limit on the quantum corrections on the linear model , or calculating the same quantum corrections on the nonlinear model . in our case",
    "we find instead that the large coupling limit of the @xmath11 model is completely equivalent to the large @xmath3 limit of the quantum nonlinear @xmath1 model .",
    "we also derive the evolution equations for the nonlinear model at the leading order in the @xmath12 expansion , in the case of an initial field condensate different from zero .",
    "we implement the constraint by the use of a lagrange multiplier , which we denote @xmath13 , since it enters the dynamics as a squared mass .",
    "we show that the usual renormalization procedure , which makes the bare coupling constant depend on the uv cutoff , is sufficient to get properly renormalized , that is uv finite , evolution equations . moreover , we characterize the ground state of the model , giving an interpretation of the dynamical generation of mass ( the so ",
    "called dimensional transmutation ) in terms of a compromise between energetic requirements and the constraint .",
    "we conclude by describing suitable initial conditions for the condensate and the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we want to emphasize that , while the approach we follow in the study of the dynamical evolution in this field theory has become by now quite standard and is very similar to that of ref.s @xcite , the different dynamical properties of the nonlinear @xmath1 model leads to different and new results , most notably the absence of parametric resonances and the consequent need for a detailed study of the scaling properties with respect to variation of @xmath7 , which we describe in the second part of this work .    in sec .",
    "[ num ] we present the analysis of the numerical evolution for the condensate and the lagrange multiplier as well as for the number of particles created during the relaxation of the condensate ( the quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "remarkably , we do not find any period of exponential growth for the fluctuations . actually , no spinodal instabilities were to be expected , since the symmetry is always unbroken in 1 + 1 dimension .",
    "but there occurs also no parametric resonance , as takes place instead in the unbroken symmetry scenario of the large@xmath14 @xmath4 model in @xmath6 dimension .",
    "this is due to the quite different nonlinearities of the @xmath15model and in particular to the nonlinear constraint [ see eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) ] which sets an upper bound to the quantum infrared fluctuations [ see fig .",
    "[ sigma - fig ] ] .",
    "in fact , even if the constraint disappears as the bare coupling constant @xmath16 vanishes in the infinite uv cutoff limit ( asymptotic freedom ) , the quantum fluctuations in any given finite range of momentum remain constrained to finite values , as implied by the possibility of fully renormalize the model , including the constraint [ see eq . ( [ ren_lm ] ) ] .",
    "because of this and of the reduced momentum phase space , we observe that the damping of the condensate is not as efficient as in the large@xmath14 @xmath4 model in @xmath6 dimension with unbroken symmetry . as a matter of fact",
    "our data do not even allow to establish for sure that the condensate will eventually relax to zero ( in the case with zero angular momentum , see below ) .",
    "in particular , we carefully study , by numerical fit and self  consistent analytic computations , the asymptotic evolution of the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the estimated dependence of its asymptotic value , @xmath17 , on the initial condensate @xmath18 , turns out to be very well approximated by an exponential , which is the exact dependence of @xmath19 [ at infinite uv cutoff , see eqs .",
    "( [ alfadiro ] ) and ( [ m0dia ] ) ] ; remarkably however , the prefactor in the exponent is changed [ see eq .",
    "( [ minfrho ] ) ] .",
    "we also verify that , after the proper renormalization , the dependence of the asymptotic values on the uv cutoff @xmath7 is only by inverse powers .",
    "as far as the emission of particles is concerned , we considered three different reference states : the initial state , the adiabatic vacuum state and the equilibrium vacuum state , that is the true ground state of the theory .",
    "the numerical results suggest a weak nonlinear resonance , yielding a relaxation of the condensate via particle production driven by power laws with non universal anomalous exponents , a result similar to what found in @xcite for the asymptotic dynamics of @xmath4 in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "however , more numerical as well as analytical work is necessary for a better quantitative estimates .",
    "finally , since we allow the condensate to have a number @xmath20 of components larger than @xmath21 , we are able to study the evolution of configurations with non  zero angular momentum @xmath22 in the internal space of the field [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) ] . in this case",
    "we find numerical evidence for an adiabatic spectrum broader than in the case @xmath23 [ see figure [ lneq0_3 ] ] , suggesting a stronger coupling with hard modes . again , more work is necessary for a better understanding of this issue .",
    "there are , of course , physically relevant issues which are not addressed in this paper , like the effects of subleading ( in @xmath12 ) terms , which may lead to genuine thermalization , and the consequent non  uniformities between large time and large @xmath3 , or the comparison with the evolution of spatial inhomogeneous condensate @xcite .",
    "it nevertheless appears evident that , when compared to the unconstrained @xmath4 model , the dynamics of this constrained model has qualitatively different properties , which deserve a separated and more detailed analysis .",
    "the classical lagrangian of the @xmath0 @xmath24 model is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a multiplet transforming under the fundamental representation of @xmath0 and constrained to the @xmath27dimensional sphere of radius @xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath30 may be regarded as the coupling constant , since the sphere flattens out in the @xmath31 limit .",

    "we have replaced the coupling constant @xmath30 with @xmath16 ( the _ bare _ coupling constant ) to stress the fact that in quantum field theory it is generally cut - off dependent .",
    "now we derive the quantum dynamics in the large @xmath3 limit , applying a general technique already used in the analysis of the @xmath4 dynamics in finite volume @xcite and based on well  known work by yaffe @xcite .",
    "if we consider the nonlinear model as a limit of the @xmath4 linear model ( being this true at least at the classical level ) , we have to take two limits and we might wonder whether it is legitimate to interchange their order . to be more specific ,",

[ spec_1 ] - [ asy_sp ] .",
    "since the lagrange multiplier tends asymptotically to a constant value @xmath179 , the condensate @xmath180 oscillates with frequency @xmath164 and the mode functions @xmath181 with frequency @xmath182 .",
    "this implies that particle spectra @xmath183 and @xmath184 are more and more strongly modulated as time elapses , as figs .",
    "[ inspec ] and [ eqspec ] show ; on the contrary , @xmath185 is a slowly varying function of the momentum @xmath186 ( cfr . figs .",
    "[ spec_1 ] - [ adnum0_6 ] ) , because the oscillations of the mode functions are counterbalanced by the time dependence of the adiabatic frequencies @xmath187 .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ asy_sp ] allows for a comparison of the spectra related to different initial values of the condensate .",
    "looking at the momentum distribution of the created particles at different times , we see the formation of a growing peak corresponding to soft modes .",
    "we can give an analytic , self - consistent description of this behavior at large times through a perturbative approach , similar to the one used in ref .",
    "we split the time ",
    "dependent lagrange multiplier in two parts , as in equation ( [ asymass ] ) and we treat the `` potential '' @xmath188 perturbatively , as is done in @xcite .",
    "we find the following solution : @xmath189 which is equivalent , up to terms of order @xmath190 , to @xmath191 e ^{i \\omega_q t } \\\\ & + b_q \\left [ 1 - \\frac{a \\sin \\psi ( t)}{4im_{\\infty}t } - \\frac{a}{8\\omega_qt } \\left ( \\frac{e ^{i \\psi ( t)}}{\\omega_q - m_{\\infty } } + \\frac{e ^{-i \\psi ( t)}}{\\omega_q + m_{\\infty } } \\right ) \\right ] e ^{- i \\omega_q t } + o\\left(\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath192 .",
    "the logarithmic dependence is due to the `` coulomb form '' of the perturbative term @xmath188 in the equations of motion .",
    "the expression ( [ pert_z ] ) displays resonant denominators for @xmath193 , that is @xmath194 .",
    "the perturbative approach is valid as long as the first order correction is small compared to zeroth order .",
    "such a condition is satisfied if @xmath195 that implies @xmath196 for non relativistic modes .",
    "thus the position of the peak found before may be interpreted as the result of a weak nonlinear resonance .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the condensate and the mode functions related to soft momenta must be obtained through non - perturbative techniques , implementing a multitime scales analysis and a dynamical resummation of sub - leading terms .",
    "a self - consistent justification of the numerical result ( [ pert1 ] ) , along with the power law relaxation behavior for the expectation value ( with non - universal dynamical anomalous dimensions ) , are likely to be obtained following the line of the analysis performed in @xcite for the @xmath4 model in @xmath6 dimensions .    from the numerical study of the complete spectrum history , we conclude that no exponentially growing ( parametric or spinodal ) instabilities are present in the case at hand , as apparent from fig.s [ spec_1 ] - [ adnum0_6 ] , which show the spectrum of produced particles with respect to the adiabatic vacuum state .",
    "the natural continuation of this paper is the detailed numerical study of the evolution , in order to give a precise picture of the process of mean field dissipation via particle production in the framework of this constrained , asymptotically free model . it should be possible to determine precisely the power laws that characterize the asymptotic evolution of relevant variables , like the condensate , the lagrange multiplier and the number of created particles .",
    "after this , one should be able to decide whether , at zero angular momentum , the damping leads to the complete dissipation of the energy stored in the condensate or the system evolves towards a limit cycle with an asymptotic amplitude different form @xmath197 .",
    "also a comparison with the linear model in @xmath2 dimension might be useful to understand the peculiarities of the dynamics in a constrained model .",
    "moreover , it would be very interesting to study the dependence of the evolution on the value of @xmath22 , the angular momentum of the field in the internal space . as the preliminary results presented in this paper show ( see figure [ lneq0_3 ] ) , the asymptotic state is far from the state of minimum energy compatible with the given value of @xmath22 . remarkably , the adiabatic spectrum of produced particles in case of @xmath198 is broader than that one corresponding to @xmath23 , suggesting a stronger coupling with hard modes .",
    "most important , the effects of the inclusion of @xmath199 corrections and the evolution of non unigorm condensates should be analyzed also in the framework of the nonlinear @xmath1 model in @xmath2 dimension .",
