    "in acoustic experiments , the time - reversal mirror ( trm ) technique has been developed by mathias fink and collab .",
    "@xcite in order to focus ultrasonic waves through heterogeneous media .",
    "the remarkable robustness of this technique against inhomogeneities allows novel applications in medical physics @xcite , oceanography @xcite and telecommunications @xcite .",
    "the acoustic signals diverging from a localized source point or scatterer are recorded by an array of transducers until all excitations have decayed .",
    "their registries are then played - back following the inverted time sequence .",
    "notably , with this simple prescription , the initial excitation is recovered in the source region up to a good degree of fidelity .",
    "this constitutes an alternative form of achieving the loschmidt echo @xcite , i.e. the time reversal of an excitation that has spread in a complex medium . in its closed version ,",
    "called time - reversal cavity , the array of transducers @xmath0 encloses the source region separating the space in two portions : the closed cavity @xmath1 , where the focusing takes place ; and the outer region , towards which all the excitations finally escapes . in order to ensure the perfect refocusing and quantify the stability of the trm",
    ", we have introduced a formal prescription for quantum systems denoted as the perfect inverse filter ( pif ) @xcite .",
    "this achieves exact focusing by injecting a wave function that has to be corrected to account for the time reversed signal and the system response .",
    "the injection prescription was derived as a solution to the schrdinger equation with boundary source conditions that arises when a wave packet arrives at the cavity from the outside .",
    "as the wave packet enters at the cavity , it interferes with its reflected component and finally spreads out in space and time .",
    "the reversed counterpart is obtained via the injection process and a burst of wave probability is emitted from @xmath1 .",
    "this is the quantum version of the _ sound bazooka _ , suggested by m. fink and collaborators @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we implemented this prescription in a classical chain of harmonic oscillators @xcite . in that case , a low frequency mode ( e.g. a heavy mass ) was coupled to a semi - infinite chain of lighter masses leading to broad continuum spectrum of excitations that acts as an `` environment '' .",
    "the energy stored in the surface oscillator decays almost exponentially and its propagation was registered by a single transducer inside the environment . in this case where all the normal modes participate in the local excitation ,",
    "the pif correction becomes effective and both the dynamical build - up and the final contrast , spatial distribution of the recovered initial condition , are substantially improved .",
    "in addition to the trm , fink and collab . proposed the spatio - temporal inverse filter ( stif ) for acoustic waves as a focusing method that optimizes spatial contrast @xcite .",
    "it requires the inversion of the fourier transform of the direct wavefield propagator .",
    "this matrix is build from the temporal response at the transducers to a dirac delta function in each control point within the focal region .",
    "unlike the trm , the stif injection acts as a highly invasive technique because it is necessary to measure the full propagator whereas the former only need to compute the row related to the focal point .",
    "recently , an alternative proposal by _ vignon et al . _",
    "@xcite , denoted minimally invasive stif ( mistif ) , achieves the same focusing quality than stif .",
    "the idea behind this procedure is that all the information in the wavefield propagator can be deduced from the backscattering signals of the transducer array at the boundaries .",
    "hence the technique is no more invasive than trm . in this context , mistif and pif result",
    "similar because they correct the trm injection function using the propagator in the reduced basis of the transducers .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the pif procedure for the case in which the source is placed inside the cavity . in sec .",
    "ii the general pif formula is deduced from the properties of the system green s function .",
    "the obtained result is then applied in a semi - infinite chain with a single transducer and also to a general multichannel system .",
    "for this last case , a numerical simulation is performed yieding a favourable test of the most difficult task : the time reversal of an initially localized excitation . in sec .",
    "iii the pif is reobtained from the optical theorem and compared with the mistif technique .",
    "we look for the situation in which at the initial time _ all _ excitations are located _ inside _ the cavity .",
    "if we denote by @xmath2 the coefficient of the initial condition at site @xmath3 , then we have @xmath4 during the propagation from @xmath5 until a registration time @xmath6 , the wave function is detected and recorded as crosses the boundaries @xmath0 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a matrix arrangement whose element @xmath9 relates the response at site @xmath10 to a dirac delta function @xmath11 in @xmath12 following the schrdinger equation whose hamiltonian is @xmath13 @xmath14 the fourier transform of this matrix gives the retarded green s function @xmath15   _ { x , x^{\\prime}}. \\label{eq_green}\\ ] ] assuming that there are no localized states , the registration time @xmath6 is taken long enough in order to ensure that all excitations have been left the cavity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "as we have shown in ref.@xcite , the time reversion for a wave packet arriving at the cavity from the outer region is performed through the injection @xmath17",
    "^{-1}\\vec{\\psi}_{b}^{\\mathrm{rev}}(\\varepsilon).\\ ] ] notice that in the above expression , @xmath18 accounts for the time reversed _ complete evolution _ of the wave packet , i.e. both the incoming and outgoing components are necessary in order to compute @xmath19 . however , in the present work we want to reverse the signal that is produced inside the cavity .",
    "then , we should deal with the building up of the complete evolution from the knowledge of only a partial component @xmath20 at times @xmath21 . by supposing that the injection function is known , the reversed propagation at the boundary should be @xmath22",
    "since the pif prescription achieves for exact reversion inside the cavity , the evolution at subsequent times can be assumed as the wave packet that starts at the focalization time with @xmath23 .",
    "thus , for subsequent times we have @xmath24 a comparison between eqs.([eq_for ] ) and ( [ eq_subs ] ) shows that for the most simple case in which all coefficients of @xmath25 are real , both evolutions become identical .",
    "the same evolution but sign changed should be obtained when @xmath25 is purely imaginary .    in a more general situation where the coefficients present relative phases we start with the fourier transform    @xmath26   , \\label{eq_rev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the second term within the brackets can be interpreted as the unknown evolution for subsequent times . at this point",

    "these errors are related with the approximation done by the trotter - suzuki and because a finite registration time was taken .",
    "once we have the corrected injection , we reverse the dynamic and compare it with the trm case .",

    "notice that in the case where the eigen - energies are close together and the band width becomes wider , the pif correction is only a constant pre - factor and the focalization quality by trm increases .",
    "in a more general point of view , we may develop an alternative derivation of the pif formula based on the fundamental optical theorem @xcite . in words ,",

    "the strategy of stif is to compute the inverse of the propagator @xmath118 .",

    "\\label{eq_stif}%\\ ] ] notice that this filter requires the determination of the non - local green s function connecting the transducer at @xmath49 and the focal point @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the mistif was developed as a procedure that replaces it in terms of the local green s function at the transducer site .",
    "such replacement is enabled by the optical theorem@xmath125 applied to an infinite chain where @xmath126 . here , @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) is the self - energy correction that accounts for the free propagation at the left ( right ) of the focal point ( transducer ) whose imaginary part is @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",

    "this actually results as the back - propagation of the `` original '' pulse excitation . as such , in our one dimensional homogenous case , the amplitude at the focal point is not a delta function in the time domain but @xmath138 , a bessel function of first kind . in the acoustic case , where the wave function normalization is not required ,",
    "this can becomes an approximation to the delta function as @xmath66 .",
    "we presented the generalization of the pif focusing method in the internal source condition .",
    "although we considered the schrdinger equation , since this formulation is based in general properties of the propagators , as before @xcite , the results remain valid to describe sound propagation .",
    "contrary to what happens when the source is external , the prescription one has to use in this case does not involve internal details of the cavity but only simpler information about the propagation in the outer region .",
    "this simplified filter applies to two physically relevant situations : 1 ) when the excitation is actually originated in the interior of the cavity by an external source . in this case , one obtains a perfect reversal of the wave function for all the times after the source have been turned - off .",
    "2 ) whenever one uses an external source , but one can separate the incoming from the outgoing waves . in that case , one can use the recording of the outgoing wave to perfectly reverse the whole excursion of the excitation through the cavity . in principle",
    ", one can achieve this condition when the boundaries are placed far enough from the reverberant region .",
    "an interesting consequence of our result is the affirmation that for close cavities in the acoustic case , trm should produce perfect time reversal , up to a constant factor , provided that the external propagation is free of collisions .",
    "we confirm the validity of this expression both analytically and numerically in a multichannel system and compared with its trm counterpart .",
    "results on the reversion quality show that pif correction constitute a notable improvement over trm prescription in cases where the energy dependence has a non - linear dispersion relation , as typical excitations described by the schrdinger equation , or when the escape velocity presents structures due to the presence of many simultaneously propagating channels or when collisions outside the cavity have a relevant contribution ."
