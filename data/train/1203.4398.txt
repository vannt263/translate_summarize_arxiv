    "certain magnetic compounds lack conventional magnetic long - range order but develop static order below a temperature @xmath9 , with locally `` frozen '' spins .",
    "well - known examples are spin - glasses but there are now examples of geometrically frustrated compounds with somewhat different microscopic properties .",
    "they are dense ( one spin per site on a periodic lattice ) , but have a rather small `` frozen '' moment .",
    "the physical origin of such glassy - like phases is an interesting issue .",
    "it may be a spin - glass phase associated with weak quenched disorder@xcite or it may be more intrinsic to the pure compound and its geometrical frustration .",
    "for example , structural glasses do lack quenched disorder but are out - of - equilibrium with a relaxation time longer than the observation time of the experiment .",
    "it is a general idea that the frustration , by suppressing long - range order , may lead to glassy - like phases.@xcite in the present paper , we study the relaxation to equilibrium of the dynamics of a simple spin model , in the presence of geometrical frustration . we find that the spin relaxation is nonexponential and develops spontaneously two time - scales below a crossover temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the system does not slow down uniformly in space ; instead , it develops some fast - moving and slow - moving regions characterized by an emergent length - scale ( called `` dynamical heterogeneities '' in the context of structural glasses@xcite ) . below a second crossover temperature @xmath9",
    ", the slow - moving spins may appear `` frozen '' on the experimental time - scale , _",
    "i.e. _ the system has fallen out - of - equilibrium . in this case , the system is found to be trapped into one of an exponential number of metastable states and some local disorder is self - induced .    competing local spin interactions resulting _",
    "e.g. _ from the geometrical frustration of the lattice tend to suppress the magnetic long - range order . at low temperatures ,",
    "some local correlations appear and the system is in a collective paramagnetic regime .",
    "the spin dynamics is different from that of a high - temperature paramagnet : the system still has a macroscopic number of accessible states but these states are locally constrained .",
    "the spin dynamics is hindered by these local constraints : single spin flips become suppressed if they violate local arrangements and the degrees of freedom acquire a more collective nature , which , in the present context , are loops ( or `` strings '' ) of spins .",
    "the issue is whether these cooperative excitations are efficient enough to reorganize the system as in the liquid state ( here the paramagnetic state ) or if the system is `` jammed '' .",
    "such excitations are rather ubiquitous and appear in different contexts , _",
    "e.g. _ ice and ferroelectrics.@xcite stringlike excitations have been also identified in molecular dynamics simulations of structural glasses@xcite and were argued to indeed play a role in the glass transition problem.@xcite here we study how these excitations self - organize in a simple degenerate spin model _ on a lattice _ , and how they permit or not , depending on temperature , the relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "we find that , while the motion of long loops is very efficient at high temperatures , it is too slow at low temperatures and the residual `` rapid '' degrees of freedom do not lead to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the magnetic materials we have in mind are highly frustrated systems with spins on the sites of the two - dimensional kagome lattice , but some spin - ice systems on the three - dimensional pyrochlore lattice have a rather similar phenomenology,@xcite and sustain similar loop excitations.@xcite the kagome systems have a spin freezing transition at @xmath9 but the `` frozen '' moment is rather small and the system retains some dynamics below @xmath9 .",

    "e.g. _ further - neighbor interactions,@xcite or dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions,@xcite the issue of the spin freezing is delicate .",
    "many theoretical studies of spin freezing phenomena in the context of the kagome antiferromagnet have been undertaken , mainly from classical or semi - classical approaches .",
    "the role of the local collective degrees of freedom ( also called `` weathervane '' modes ) was put forward , leading to the conjecture of a spin freezing for the heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet.@xcite it was later argued that distortions may help in stabilizing a `` frozen '' state , e.g. a trimerized kagome antiferromagnet has slow dynamics on time - scales of single spin - flips,@xcite ( short compared with the time - scales probed in the present study , as we shall see ) or distorted kagome lattices.@xcite it is in discrete spin models that a `` jamming '' transition was found , in the presence of additional interactions that favor an ordered state : the dynamics becomes very slow as a consequence of a special coarsening of the domains of the ordered phase.@xcite here we shall consider similar discrete spins , with a different classical dynamics ( not induced by additional interactions -the equilibrium state remains paramagnetic ) , but resulting from activated motion within discrete degenerate states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we introduce a simple degenerate spin model and the associated dynamics within the degenerate ground states . section [ micro ] gives a heuristic motivation based on a microscopic model more appropriate to real kagome compounds . in section [ dynamics ] , we present the results of monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of the degenerate model . in section [ fragmentation ] , we study how the phase space gets fragmented in many metastable states and compute the configurational entropy from finite - size scaling .",
    "we compare with experiments on kagome compounds in section [ exp ] and conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a classical three - coloring model@xcite with spin variables @xmath17 a , b , c ( three possible colors , or spins at 120@xmath18 ) defined on a lattice .",
    "@xmath19 are the bonds of the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice , or the sites of the kagome lattice ( fig .",
    "[ n6flip ] ) .",
    "there is a strict local constraint which forces neighboring sites to be in different colors , and each state @xmath12 that satisfies the constraint has energy , @xmath20 by definition .",
    "the number of degenerate states is macroscopic ( extensive entropy ) and was calculated exactly in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite as a consequence of eq .",
    "[ ei=0 ] , the temperature has no effect on the thermodynamics of the model : at equilibrium , each state @xmath12 has the same probability . yet the spin - spin correlations averaged over the uniform ensemble are nontrivial because of the local constraint and decay algebraically ( `` critical '' state).@xcite however , the model has no dynamics and one has to specify a particular model to study dynamical properties .",
    "here we consider the simplest dynamics within the degenerate states , _",
    "i.e. _ compatible with the constraint .",
    "while the constraint forbids single color changes , the simplest motion consists of exchanging two colors along a closed loop of @xmath21 sites ( fig .",
    "[ n6flip ] ) .",
    "we assume an activation process over a barrier of energy @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 depends on microscopic details ) , with a time - scale , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature and @xmath26 a microscopic time .",
    "the exact form ( eq .  [ tau ] ) is unessential , the important point being that longer loops take longer time ( local dynamics ) .",
    "since the system is known to have a power - law distribution of loop lengths@xcite ( reflecting the criticality of the thermodynamical state ) , we have therefore a broad distribution of time - scales in the problem . however , the loops are strongly correlated and the spin dynamics is nontrivial .",
    "it has been argued that such constrained problems can be described at large scales by effective gauge theories .",
    "such examples are spin - ice systems or hard - core dimers which can be viewed as artificial coulomb phases.@xcite the local constraint is solved by an auxiliary ( divergence - free ) gauge field and a long - wavelength free - energy is postulated .",
    "it describes , as in standard electrostatics , algebraic correlations at long distance .",
    "the hydrodynamic parameters are then extracted from the comparison with exact results ( in the present case,@xcite the baxter solution@xcite ) or numerics .",
    "furthermore , it also allows one to predict a relaxational dynamics ( _ e.g. _ langevin ) and the slowest spin - spin correlations are expected to decay as a power - law , as in dimer models.@xcite    however , we also find a different `` short - time '' regime , resulting from the microscopic model we are considering .",
    "indeed , the motion of a loop reorganizes its immediate vicinity and can facilitate the motion of a so far frozen neighbor ( see fig .",
    "[ n6flip ] ) . in this sense , this resembles kinetically constrained models where the motion of a local variable needs a specific configuration of its neighbors,@xcite but the kinetic constraints here result directly from the local correlations .",
    "although the system is fully packed with loops ( each site belongs to two loops ) , the issue is how the loops ( and especially the small loops ) self - organize .",
    "we give some heuristic justifications for the model of section [ model ] , based on microscopic considerations .",
    "the model can indeed be viewed as an effective model within the ground state manifold of some more general hamiltonian , at @xmath27 where @xmath28 is defined below .",
    "we consider first a heisenberg model , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a quantum spin @xmath31 operator on site @xmath19 of the kagome lattice , and @xmath28 an antiferromagnetic coupling between nearest neighbor spins . we will discuss the semi - classical treatment for which the classical states are the important starting point .",
    "the minimization of the classical energy associated with [ eq .  [ h0 ] ] leads to many degenerate states where spins point at 120@xmath18 apart on each triangle .",
    "these states are not necessarily coplanar ; however , the coplanar states have the lowest free - energy at low @xmath25 , a form of ( partial ) order - by - disorder to a `` nematic '' state.@xcite similarly , for quantum fluctuations at order @xmath32 in spin - wave theory , the zero - point energy is minimized by the coplanar states.@xcite however , all coplanar states remain degenerate at the harmonic level .",
    "the spins pointing at 120@xmath18 in the common plane are represented by three colors a , b , c and the three - color states therefore form the ground state manifold of the model [ eq .  [ h0 ] ] .",
    "it is a rather difficult issue to calculate the lifting of the degeneracy due to anharmonic fluctuations . in this respect ,",
    "the long - range ordered nel state with a @xmath33 unit - cell plays a special role .",
    "it was indeed argued that small - amplitude fluctuations ( albeit anharmonic , _",
    "i.e. _ at the next order in spin - wave theory ) favor this state,@xcite this is similar to the result of schwinger - boson mean - field theory,@xcite although this is true only at ( small ) finite @xmath25.@xcite from high-@xmath25 series expansion , the degeneracy is indeed lifted but is a small effect.@xcite    by eq .",
    "[ ei=0 ] , we assume that the lifting of the degeneracy is small compared with both the temperature and the energy barriers .",
    "the generation of an energy barrier by fluctuations is typical of order - by - disorder.@xcite a canonical example is the @xmath34 model on the square lattice .",
    "while two sublattice nel order - parameters can point in any direction at the classical level , the fluctuations select the collinear arrangements.@xcite the rotation of one sublattice order - parameter with respect to the other costs a ( fluctuation - induced ) macroscopic energy .",
    "there remains only two degenerate states separated by an energy barrier of @xmath35 , the number of sites ( broken symmetry ) . in systems with a macroscopic number of degenerate states ,",
    "the situation is different because local modes connect different degenerate states .",
    "the states are separated by barriers of o(1 ) and the associated dynamics which consists of large - amplitude motion of collective spins eq .",
    "[ tau ] may be relevant.@xcite there are two different processes : the small fluctuations about a given state of the manifold , and the large - amplitude motion within the manifold . for continuous spins ,",
    "the large - amplitude motion consists of rotating collectively the spins of a loop , out - of - plane , by an angle @xmath36 in a cone at 120@xmath18 , thus preserving the constraint .",
    "the corresponding fluctuation - induced barriers were calculated numerically and appear not to be a pure function of the loop length as assumed in eq .",
    "[ tau ] , but also depend on the configuration.@xcite however , for small loops at the lowest @xmath25 ( when the fluctuation energy is dominated by the quantum zero - point motion ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath38),@xcite and eq .",
    "[ tau ] is justified .    at very low temperatures , quantum tunneling through the barrier",
    "may take place@xcite and the time - scales of eq .",
    "[ tau ] saturate.@xcite the time - scales then depend on the barrier shapes and the model considered.@xcite    in real systems , symmetry - breaking fields of spin - orbit origin may be present and provide also some energy barriers .",
    "consider for example , @xmath39 which is chosen to be compatible with the 3-coloring states : @xmath40 is an easy - plane ( xy ) anisotropy and the three vectors @xmath41 are directed at 120@xmath18 in the kagome plane.@xcite in the limit of strong @xmath42 , @xmath43 is analogous to the 6-state clock model,@xcite except for the degeneracy of the classical ground states .",
    "we note that in the opposite limit of ising - like xxz anisotropy , although the system orders ferromagnetically , there is a slow persistent dynamics of creation of loops.@xcite we will restrict the discussion to @xmath40 and @xmath44 in the following .",
    "when the anisotropy is small ( which is generally the case of intermetallic magnetic ions ) , rotating the spins of a loop continuously by @xmath36 , defines a classical energy barrier , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "when the anisotropy is strong ( possibly more appropriate to rare - earth compounds ) , it is too costly to rotate all components out - of - plane .",
    "the lowest - energy excitations consist of violating the constraint by nucleating defects .",
    "the simplest effective process for the spins to move in the constrained manifold is to create two defects along a loop .",
    "this costs twice the exchange energy but the defects are then free to move along the loop ( deconfinement ) and leave behind them a string of exchanged colors.@xcite when the defects annihilate , the loop has flipped .",
    "the time - scale of this process is given by eq .",
    "[ tau ] , with @xmath47.@xcite this is the important effective process in spin - ice systems in general , and the nonequilibrium dynamics of defects has been directly studied recently.@xcite    note that by using the discrete model , we intend to describe only the slow collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the rapid motion about the `` equilibrium '' state ( spin - waves ) is present in the continuous spin model but is integrated out in the discrete model ( in the barrier ) , at the first order of spin - wave theory.@xcite",
    "the system evolves in the classical degenerate manifold by the motion of closed loops , described by a local stochastic activated process given by eq .",
    "[ tau ] .",
    "we have studied the spin ( color ) dynamics by classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "such monte carlo simulations have been used to study the equilibrium state of constrained or loop models,@xcite and also in the present context.@xcite in these simulations , the updates were accepted following the metropolis algorithm , and irrespective of the length of the loop . here , the aim is not to probe the equilibrium state ( which is known ) but to study how the spin dynamics slows down when longer loops have to pass higher energy barriers , which take more time .",
    "the issue is rather to study the relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "the algorithm is similar to that used earlier : ( a ) we choose a single site at random , ( b ) we choose a neighbor of this site at random ( this defines two colors , hence one of the three types of loop a - b , a - c , or b - c ) ( c ) we search among its four neighbors the site with the same color as the original site ( but distinct from it ) and we iterate until a closed loop is formed ( this is guaranteed by the periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "contrary to previous studies , however , the colors are exchanged along the two - color loop ( the loop is `` flipped '' ) according to the probability to cross the barrier , @xmath48 .",
    "this amounts to choose in the metropolis acceptation rate a microscopic rate which depends on the degree of freedom that moves .",
    "the cluster sizes are @xmath49 , @xmath21 is the linear size ( up to @xmath50 ) and a monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) corresponds to @xmath51 attempted updates .    we have computed the autocorrelation function @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an average over initial states ( 10@xmath54 in fig .",

    "@xmath58 and if the state at time @xmath59 is decorrelated from that at @xmath60 , each spin is in one of the three possible colors with probability @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 measures how long the system keeps memory of its initial state ) . to accelerate the simulations ,",

    "[ tau ] by @xmath64 so that the shortest loops ( hexagons ) flip at each attempt . in the following ,",

    "the autocorrelation is given in fig .",
    "[ sloct ] for different temperatures .",
    "the relaxation of the system occurs on a time - scale @xmath68 and follows a power - law decay , @xmath69 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ sloct ] ) , which is well described by a long wavelength field theory , as we shall see .    below a crossover temperature @xmath10 ,",
    "the spin dynamics develops two distinct time - scales , @xmath68 and @xmath65 ( @xmath68 and @xmath65 are the notations in supercooled liquids for the long and short relaxation times ) : the autocorrelation decreases first into a plateau ( quasi - stationary state ) and then relaxes to equilibrium . at short times",
    "@xmath70 , the relaxation is approximately a stretched exponential @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . while the dynamics is spatially homogeneous above @xmath10 , it becomes heterogeneous below @xmath10 with slow and fast regions .",
    "we define the relaxation time of the system , @xmath68 , by _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath73 ( the value chosen has no consequence as long as it is small enough ) . in fig .  [ twotau ] , we give @xmath74 as a function of temperature .",
    "this ratio becomes much larger than one in the limit of low-@xmath25 , @xmath75 so that @xmath76 is controlled by the second shortest loops ( of length 10 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the time that characterizes the initial decay of @xmath63 , defined by @xmath77 , is of order @xmath78 ( fig .  [ twotau ] ) , _ i.e. _ controlled by the shortest loops .",
    "such definitions and spontaneous generations of two time - scales appeared in a different spin model where the frustration is played by long - range interactions which fragment the system into domains.@xcite    by rescaling all the curves by @xmath68 , we find that the decay at long times is a power - law , @xmath79 with @xmath80 ( see the inset of fig .  [ sloct ] ) .",
    "since @xmath81 , the integrated relaxation time @xmath82 diverges , and , at small frequencies , the fourier transform diverges like @xmath83 ( we do not discuss here some natural cutoffs provided by _",
    "e.g. _ defects at finite temperatures ) .",
    "the long - time regime reflects the criticality of the equilibrium state and is well described by a free vector - field model .",
    "the model is obtained by a mapping of the color variables onto an auxiliary two - component height field @xmath84 defined at the centers of the hexagons.@xcite the construction is as follows : the height vector @xmath84 picks up a @xmath85 vector each time it crosses a @xmath86a , b , c color with the condition @xmath87 .",
    "in such a way , the local constraint is automatically satisfied .",
    "one assumes that the free - energy ( of purely entropic origin ) reads @xmath88 where @xmath84 is the coarse - grained height field .",

    "( [ f ] ) describes a classical@xcite interface in two spatial dimensions .",
    "similarly to dimer models,@xcite the classical fluctuations of the interface can be described by langevin equations , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a two - dimensional white noise , @xmath93 .",
    "[ langevin ] describes a simple diffusion of the height of the interface .",
    "the mapping to the slowest spin fluctuations , @xmath94 , @xmath95,@xcite gives the spin correlations at long times and long distance , @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( from eq .",

    "we therefore obtain @xmath100 , in good agreement with the @xmath101 found numerically ( see inset of fig .",

    "the approach also explains that the exponent does not vary with @xmath25 because the underlying critical phase is independent of @xmath25 , by definition .",

    "[ langevin ] are important and lead to a different dynamics , as we now show .",
    "below a crossover temperature @xmath102 , a shoulder develops in @xmath63 and the relaxation time @xmath68 starts to differ from @xmath65 which characterizes the initial decay .",
    "@xmath63 develops a plateau which becomes more and more stable when @xmath25 is further lowered .",
    "the limiting value of the plateau is ( see fig .",
    "[ sloct ] ) , @xmath103 it gives the averaged frozen moment on time - scales shorter than @xmath68 , which we note @xmath104 . on these time - scales ,",
    "only the hexagons have dynamics : all other loops are blocked until @xmath105 at which a loop of length 10 may flip , and the system leaves the plateau and returns to equilibrium .    when the relaxation time of the system becomes longer than the experimental time , @xmath106 , the system is out - of - equilibrium .",

    "the system is trapped into the plateau .",
    "once all fast processes have occurred ( _ i.e. _ after @xmath65 ) the system is in a quasi - stationary state with frozen moment squared @xmath112 ( we reserve the term `` edwards - anderson order - parameter '' to true equilibrium phase transition ) .",
    "we can furthermore calculate @xmath112 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "it is related to the susceptibility by @xmath113 the frozen fraction depends logarithmically on time below @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ q ] ) , so that @xmath114 has a cusp at @xmath9 between a high-@xmath25 paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath115 and a low-@xmath25 time - dependent susceptibility .",
    "the existence of a frozen moment on average is both the consequence of frozen regions ( which are purely static ) and dynamical regions with a finite moment on average ( because of a recurrent behavior ) . in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] , we show the autocorrelation @xmath116 on each site , at intermediate times in the quasi - stationary state ( @xmath57 is white , @xmath117 is black if it has never moved between 0 and @xmath59 or gray otherwise ) . while most sites have dynamics ( white and gray ) ,",
    "there is a fraction of frozen sites ( in black ) .",
    "the averaged fraction of frozen sites is @xmath118 , and the probability distribution function is found to be gaussian ( as a consequence , fig .",
    "[ overlap ] is typical of what happens at low @xmath25 ) .",
    "the existence of 12.1@xmath13 of frozen sites explains only part of the averaged frozen moment , @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , other ( dynamical ) sites contribute .",
    "this is because the frozen clusters provide boundary conditions for the neighboring sites and the constraint propagates between clusters .",
    "for instance , the spins on the outer side of the cluster boundary can take only two of the three possible states , the third possibility being frozen inside the cluster .",
    "they have hence stronger probabilities to return to the original value . in fig .  [ overlap ] , we indeed see , extending between the frozen clusters , large dynamical regions where the spins are in their original state ( gray ) .",
    "these constrained regions contribute to almost two thirds of the averaged frozen moment .",
    "furthermore , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] that frozen sites form clusters randomly distributed over the system .",
    "the number of spins in a cluster is distributed according to fig .",
    "[ histcluster ] .",
    "the average is @xmath120 sites ( and is size independent for @xmath121 , see inset of fig .",
    "[ histcluster ] ) , thus defining an emergent length scale @xmath122 intersite spacings .",
    "the picture of the frozen phase is that of `` jammed '' clusters of nanoscopic scale @xmath123 occupying 12.1@xmath13 of the sites .    what is the origin of the `` jamming '' ?",
    "first , `` jammed '' clusters do not contain flippable hexagons ( by definition ) but are , of course , criss - crossed by longer loops which are blocked at the temperatures considered .",
    "this implies that a typical three - coloring state must have a low - enough density of flippable hexagons . on the kagome lattice",
    "the density of flippable hexagons ( averaged over the uniform ensemble ) is 0.22 , so that forming a large cluster of @xmath12442 sites on average is unlikely in absence of correlations . in fig .",
    "[ structurefactorloop ] , we give the correlations @xmath125 ( radial distribution function ) in the positions of the flippable hexagons of the same type.@xcite we find indeed a strong attraction : the neighboring hexagons can not be occupied by the same type of loop ( it is incompatible with the constraint ) but the second neighbor positions are highly favored ( attraction ) . there is a high probability to have a flippable hexagon if the ( second ) neighbor is a flippable hexagon .",
    "this attraction creates aggregates and voids , opening the way to regions free of flippable hexagons .",
    "the system can therefore be viewed as a microscopic phase separation of active and inactive regions , the active regions having flippable hexagons , the inactive regions having longer loops .",
    "recall that the degenerate model can be seen as being at the boundary of a phase transition in parameter space,@xcite in particular between active and inactive phases , having respectively short and long loops.@xcite this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the region to be `` jammed '' because the number of flippable hexagons is not conserved by the dynamics and they `` move '' on the lattice ( see fig .  [ n6flip ] ) .",
    "the frozen clusters correspond to special configurations and regions inaccessible to flippable hexagons .",
    "for example , a frozen cluster of 12 sites is shown in fig .",
    "[ jam ] : each hexagon on the border has the three possible colors a , b , c , thus making it impossible to create a flippable configuration .",
    "one can have clusters of arbitrary size ( see fig .",

    "we have argued that @xmath9 is controlled by the anisotropy ( dynamically - generated or not ) , and the anisotropy is present in zncu@xmath3(oh)@xmath6cl@xmath5.@xcite two important effects are missing : it is known that antisite disorder is present,@xcite and that @xmath190 compounds have strong quantum effects with currently debated quantum spin liquid phases if the anisotropy is sufficiently weak ( such a coupling may discriminate between different phases in @xmath190 compounds@xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that competitions are important to account for all these phases .",
    "we have described a simple spin model which has a dynamical glassy - like freezing at a crossover temperature @xmath9 , in absence of any quenched disorder .",
    "the system evolves from a dynamically homogeneous phase with a single time - scale ( @xmath271 ) to a dynamically heterogeneous phase with two time - scales ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the first time - scale @xmath272 corresponds to the `` rapid '' degrees of freedom , the shortest loops .",
    "the second time - scale @xmath68 is associated with the rearrangement of the `` frozen '' clusters .",
    "the frozen clusters have a microscopic length - scale ( they typically contain a few tens of sites ) but their rearrangement time is not controlled by the their size but by the size of the second shortest loops , @xmath273 .",
    "when @xmath68 becomes longer than the experimental time - scale for @xmath111 , the system is out - of - equilibrium and glassy - like .",
    "the clusters contain spins that are frozen on the experimental time - scale and realize a microscopic - scale disorder . in this case",
    ", the system has a finite ( small ) averaged frozen moment but no true long - range order .",
    "we have explained that the frozen moment is due , partly to the frozen clusters themselves and , partly to dynamical regions where the spins are strongly constrained by the frozen regions .",
    "the phase space of the system appears to be organized in a partially hierarchical manner with conserved quantities defining @xmath160 basins separated by infinite barriers ( broken ergodicity ) .",
    "each basin was shown to further split into @xmath137 sectors separated by finite barriers which trap the system in a metastable state below @xmath9 .",
    "this macroscopic fragmentation of the phase space corresponds to the local disorder induced by the `` frozen '' clusters . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the system has therefore some `` thermodynamic '' anomalies characterized by the loss of the configurational entropy which we have calculated by finite - size scaling , @xmath274 per site .    the system undergoes a glassy - like transition at @xmath9 because the residual `` rapid '' degrees of freedom ( the shortest loops ) only _ partially _ reorganize the system . in a typical state ,",
    "the density of the shortest loops is not very small , but , by effectively attracting each other , they form aggregates and voids ( micro phase separation ) , the latter regions being , hence , frozen .",
    "some details , as to what their density is , or how they precisely interact , certainly depend on the system and the model , but the mechanism we have presented here is rather clear : the strong local correlations generate slow extended degrees of freedom which , since they are correlated and attract each other , `` phase - separate '' in dense active regions and void inactive regions .",
    "several aspects of the degenerate model are simply _",
    "assumed_. we have assumed the absence of long - range order by considering degenerate states ( eq .  [ ei=0 ] ) , and an activated relaxation time ( eq .  [ tau ] ) ; hence , not surprisingly , the dynamics is slow .",
    "we have discussed in section [ micro ] why both assumptions may be approximately realized in microscopic models with continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "we argued that the origin of the energy barriers is the partial order - by - disorder , i.e. the barriers are dynamically generated by the rapid spin - waves , or by an explicit anisotropy arising from the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the degeneracy ( eq .  [ ei=0 ] ) is in general not exact and lifting it favors a `` crystal '' state in the energy landscape without modifying -if it remains sufficiently small- the dynamical aspects we have described .",
    "we have compared the results with the experiments on the kagome compounds .",
    "the present study gives a model for the spin freezing observed at @xmath9 and provides an interpretation for the nature of the low - temperature phase .",
    "the picture of the `` frozen '' phase that emerges is that of an heterogeneous state with dynamical and frozen regions .",
    "the weak measured frozen moment is interpreted as the consequence of the remaining dynamics of the shortest loops and its strength is close to what is measured in the experiments . while in magnets in general , the on - site moment is reduced by the small oscillations around the ordered state ( spin - waves ) , here the main effect",
    "is argued to be the large - amplitude motion of the shortest loops .",
    "the short loop fluctuations do not fully destroy the moment for @xmath111 but their presence is in agreement with the persistent fluctuations observed by different experimental techniques ( neutrons , @xmath67sr , nmr ) .",
    "in particular , the observation in nmr of nuclei with different time - scales is consistent with the heterogeneous picture of the dynamics proposed here . in conventional magnets , the thermal excitations of the spin - waves",
    "destroy the on - site magnetization .",
    "here , one needs longer loops , that are thermally excited only for @xmath216 .",
    "these fluctuations give a spectral response that obeys a power - law @xmath268 in the small energy limit , very different from that of conventional magnets ( flat response in two dimensions ) . a broad power - law response",
    "is indeed observed experimentally in neutron inelastic scattering .",
    "although the exponent seems to be underestimated , the experiments may not have had access to the low - energy limit or the exponent may be inacurately predicted because of the interaction between the spin - waves and the discrete modes . in the paramagnetic phase",
    ", the model has algebraic spatial correlations at equilibrium ( @xmath216 ) , a feature that is not observed in elastic neutron scattering .",
    "we believe that this is not redhibitory , for the spin freezing we have described is not related to the long - distance behavior . in two spatial dimensions , the correlation length is always finite at finite temperatures.@xcite furthermore , the chemical disorder is present to an amount which is difficult to quantify and which has been completely neglected here .",
    "the energy scale that governs the freezing temperature @xmath9 is argued to be @xmath28 in the small anisotropy limit ( dynamically generated barriers ) , @xmath275 and it crosses over to @xmath276 in the strong anisotropy limit , typically if @xmath277 .",
    "this led us to a tentative classification , where scgo is in the small anisotropy limit and ( h@xmath3o)fe@xmath3(so@xmath4)@xmath5(oh)@xmath6 in the strong anisotropy limit .",
    "this is clearly a different interpretation from that of chemical disorder , where @xmath9 is governed by the amount of disorder.@xcite    in order to disentangle intrinsic effects from the effects of chemical disorder , one can test the present theory , in particular by characterizing experimentally the active magnetic degrees of freedom , for instance by neutron form factors,@xcite or by inferring the nanoscopic size of the frozen clusters .",

    "<S> by considering the constrained motion of classical spins in a geometrically frustrated magnet , we find a dynamical freezing temperature below which the system gets trapped in metastable states with a `` frozen '' moment and dynamical heterogeneities . </S>",
