    "in this paper we discuss the application of a skewed-@xmath0 model suitable to capture skewness and kurtosis commonly present in insurance risks data . in particular , we introduce a bayesian approach based on minimal informative prior distributions @xcite to estimate the parameters of the asymmetric student-@xmath0 distribution ( ast ) introduced in @xcite and re - proposed in @xcite .",
    "insurance risks data , for example insurance losses , tend to present skewed behaviour @xcite in almost any circumstance .",
    "furthermore , losses related to catastrophes ( e.g. earthquakes , exceptional floods , etc ) are also better modelled by distributions with relatively heavy tails , as they quite often include extreme events .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to use a statistical model that can simultaneously account for data that is skewed and with values that may be extreme in behaviour .",
    "the generalised ast distribution , presented in section [ sc_prelim ] , includes a skewness parameter and allows to control the heaviness of both the left and right tails by means of a parameter representing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "an obvious advantage of the ast , as it will be discussed , is that it allows to _ adjust _ to the observed data , in the sense that can consider both skewed and non - skewed data and heavy - tailed data as well as observations that are suitable to be modelled by a distribution with tails like the one of the normal density . in other words , by estimating the parameter controlling the skewness of the distribution and the number of degrees of freedom , translates into a model selection scenario , where the competing models are : the normal distribution , the @xmath0 distribution , the skew normal and the skew @xmath0 .",
    "it is often important to consider cases where the prior information about the true parameter values is minimal .",
    "there are circumstances where the prior information is not available or , for some reasons , it is not reliable or practical to be used . as such",
    ", we consider an inferential scenario where the prior distributions for the parameters of the model are set up according to objective bayesian criteria .",
    "note that here , the term `` objective '' is not intended to represent an actually objective set up , but simply to categorise the procedure followed to derive the prior distributions as one that provides an output in a sort of an automated fashion @xcite .",
    "the choice of the objective prior for the skewness parameter is the jeffreys prior , while for the location and the scale parameters we will adopt the reference prior . for the number of degrees of freedom we adopt the truncated discrete prior proposed in @xcite .",
    "although we do not discuss the possibility of using prior distributions elicited on the basis of reliable prior information , we still believe that it would be the most sensible way to proceed .",
    "of course , the fact that inferential results can be effectively obtained by means of an objective bayesian approach , it just strengthens the proposed model , as it allows to remove the ( not always easy ) task of translating prior information into prior probability distributions .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sc_prelim ]",
    "we introduce the asymmetric student-@xmath0 distribution and discuss some of its properties .",
    "we also present the prior distributions used for the parameters and , in particular , the prior for the number of degrees of freedom , which we argue to have a support that is discrete and truncated . in section [ sc_priors ]",
    "we explicit the prior for the number of degrees of freedom and prove its independence from the skewness parameter .",
    "this result is key in motivating the prior for @xmath1 proposed by @xcite .",
    "section [ sc_simul ] is dedicated to present the results of a simulation study aimed to analyse the frequentist properties of the posterior distribution for the number of degrees of freedom . to complete the discussion of the proposed approach to model insurance loss data , in section [ sc_real ] we analyse two well known data sets",
    "we are able to show the versatility of the model in a scenario of skewed data with extreme events and in a scenario where a symmetric normal distribution is sufficient to be used as a model .",
    "final discussion points and conclusions are presented in section [ sc_disc ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider the asymmetric student-@xmath0 ( ast ) distribution whose general density has the form @xmath2^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2 } } & \\quad x\\leq\\mu\\\\      \\dfrac{k(\\nu)}{\\sigma}\\left[1+\\dfrac{1}{\\nu}\\left(\\dfrac{x-\\mu}{2(1-\\alpha)\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2 } } & \\quad x>\\mu    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath3 represents the skewness parameter , @xmath4 is the location parameter , @xmath5 is the scale parameter , and @xmath1 represents the degrees of freedom , with @xmath6,\\ ] ] see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion of the distribution and its properties .",
    "the usual student-@xmath0 distribution can be recovered by setting @xmath7 in , while the skewed cauchy and the skewed normal distributions are special cases obtained when @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .    in the bayesian framework ,",
    "the inference about the parameter of a model is accomplished by combining the prior uncertainty about the true value of the parameters , expressed in the form of probability distributions , and the information contained in the observed sample .",
    "the latter is expressed by the likelihood function which , for the model in , has the form @xmath10^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2 } } \\times \\prod_{x_i>\\mu}\\dfrac{k(\\nu)}{\\sigma}\\left[1+\\dfrac{1}{\\nu}\\left(\\dfrac{x_i-\\mu}{2(1-\\alpha)\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if we indicate the joint prior distribution for the parameters by @xmath11 , the posterior distribution is given by @xmath12 the prior distributions will be discussed in section [ sc_priors ] .",
    "however , we believe it is useful to give an overview of the overall approach in this section .    in this paper we adopt an objective bayesian approach to make inference on the unknown parameters of the density in . to proceed , we assume that the tail parameter @xmath1 is discrete . that is , @xmath13 .",
    "the reason of choosing a discrete parameter space for @xmath1 is due to the close proximity of models with consecutive number of degrees of freedom . in line with what discussed for the @xmath0 density by @xcite and @xcite , the amount of information from the observations ( i.e. the sample size ) will rarely be sufficient to discern between consecutive densities with a difference in the number of degrees of freedom smaller than one . as such",
    ", the choice of a discrete support for @xmath1 , with intervals of size one , is sensible .",
    "it is still possible to define a discrete prior ( with the same approach ) over a more dense support ; however , the choice has to be motivated by some prior evidence , such as the certainty of dealing with a very large sample size , and the resulting prior distribution will obviously be different as the amount of information would have changed .",
    "in this section we outline the approach to derive the prior distributions for the parameters of the ast model .",
    "we dedicate most of this section to the prior for the number of degrees of freedom because , being a discrete parameter , presents some non - trivial challenges .",
    "we start by making the assumption that the parameters present , a priori , some degree of independence and , therefore , the prior has the form @xmath14 as we will show in section [ sc_nuprior ] , the prior for the number of degrees of freedom does not depend on the skewness parameter , therefore @xmath15 .",
    "it has to be noted that , although objective methods aim to obtain prior distributions depending only on the chosen model , in practice there is always some degree of subjectivity involved . in this case",
    ", we make the assumption that the parameters are independent _ a priori _ , noting that this is a common practice in objective bayesian analysis .",
    "one of the assumptions on which the model presented in this paper is based upon , is that the parameter representing the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath1 ) is considered as discrete .",
    "the specific reasons for this choice are presented in section [ sc_nuprior ] , but it is worthwhile to give an overview of the general idea behind the prior specific for @xmath1 here .",
    "whilst there are several approaches to deal with continuous parameter spaces , such as jeffreys prior @xcite and reference prior @xcite , discrete parameter spaces have always been dealt with on a case - by - case basis .",
    "only recently general solutions for the discrete case have been put forward , with different degree of success . among these ,",
    "possibly the most noteworthy include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the former approach can be applied to a limited set of models , and the latter approach shows some deficiencies in terms of objectivity and generality . in this paper",
    ", we consider the method discussed in @xcite , which , as far as we know , is the sole objective approach that can be applied to any discrete parameter space without the necessity of being `` adjusted '' to the chosen model .",
    "the prior proposed in @xcite is based on the idea of assigning a _ worth _ to each element @xmath16 of the discrete parameter space @xmath17 .",
    "the _ worth _ is objectively measured by assessing what is lost if that parameter value is removed from @xmath17 , and it is the true one . once the _ worth _ has been determined , this will be linked to the prior probability by means of the self - information loss function @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "a detailed illustration of the idea can be found in @xcite , but here is an overview .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath19 a distribution ( either a mass function or a density ) characterised by the unknown discrete parameter(s ) @xmath16 and let @xmath20 be the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence @xcite .",
    "the utility ( i.e. _ worth ) _ to be assigned to @xmath19 is a function of the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence measured from the model to the nearest one ; where the nearest model is the one defined by @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is minimised . in fact ( see @xcite ) @xmath23 is where the posterior asymptotically accumulates if the true value @xmath16 is excluded from @xmath17 .",
    "the objectivity of how the utility of @xmath19 is measured is obvious , as it depends on the choice of the model only .",
    "let us now write @xmath24 and let the minimum divergence from @xmath19 be represented by @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath26 is the utility associated with the prior probability for model @xmath19 , and @xmath25 is the utility in keeping @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "we want @xmath26 and @xmath25 to be matching utility functions , as they are two different ways to measure the same utility in @xmath16 .",
    "as it stands , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while we actually want @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "the scales are matched by taking exponential transformations ; so @xmath31 and @xmath32 are on the same scale .",
    "hence , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 by setting the functional form of @xmath35 in , as it is defined in , we derive the proposed objective prior for the discrete parameter @xmath16 as follows @xmath36 we note that in this way the bayesian approach is conceptually consistent , as we update a prior utility assigned to @xmath16 , through the application of bayes theorem , to obtain the resulting posterior utility expressed by @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , there is an elegant procedure akin to the bayes theorem which works from a utility point of view , namely that @xmath38 which has the interpretation of @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant which does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "there is then a retention of meaning between the prior and the posterior information ( here represented as utilities ) .",
    "this property is not shared by the usual interpretation of bayes theorem when priors are objectively obtained ; in fact , the prior would usually be improper , hence not representing probabilities , whilst the posterior is ( and has to be ) a proper probability distribution .",
    "in this section we will show that the prior for @xmath1 introduced in @xcite can be used as prior for @xmath1 for the skewed student-@xmath0 distribution .",
    "the prior for @xmath1 is based on similar arguments as the ones discussed in @xcite . in particular , we consider the following .",
    "first , the parameter is treated as discrete ; that is , @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is that the amount of information provided from the data will rarely be sufficient to discern densities with @xmath1 separated by an interval smaller than one .",
    "in other words , in general , the sample size is not going to be sufficient to allow estimates more precise than size one . whilst it is possible , in principle , to consider any continuous parameter as discrete , for this model we deem appropriate to limit the discretisation to @xmath1 .",
    "besides the above motivation , we note that considering @xmath1 as discrete has connection with an interpretation of a @xmath0-distributed random variable .",
    "in fact , a @xmath0 with @xmath1 degrees of freedom can be seen as the ratio of two independent random variables : a standard normal and the square root of a chi - square divided by its number of degrees of freedom @xmath1 .",
    "while in principle it is possible to discretise any continuous parameter , such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath41 , the procedure would carries a strong degree of subjectivity , namely the discretisation density .",
    "in fact , the above considerations made for @xmath1 can not be applied to the remaining three parameters of the model .",
    "hence , the choice to consider @xmath1 only as discrete .",
    "second , the parameter space of @xmath1 has to be truncated . in @xcite",
    "this argument is motivated by the fact that , as the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath1 ) of a student-@xmath0 goes to infinity , the density converges to a normal in distribution . as such , after a certain value of @xmath1 , the model can be consider normal for any value of the parameter .",
    "a sensible choice is to set @xmath42 to represent the normal model .",
    "therefore , the inference problem reduces in choosing among @xmath0 densities with @xmath43 and the normal density .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , a similar result holds for the skewed student-@xmath0 distribution as well .",
    "indeed , as @xmath1 goes to infinity , the model converges to a skewed normal distribution .",
    "this allows to apply the same truncation argument to the skewed student-@xmath0 distribution .    to derive the prior for @xmath1",
    ", we apply the approach introduced in section [ sc_intro_obj ] .",
    "let us , at first , assume that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in this case , the density in represents a symmetrical @xmath0 distribution with @xmath1 degrees of freedom , and the prior for the parameter @xmath1 has the form as in @xcite . to simplify the notation",
    ", we indicate the @xmath0-density with parameters @xmath1 , @xmath41 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 by @xmath46 ; therefore , the prior for @xmath1 is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 and , for @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the skewed normal distribution with mean @xmath4 and standard deviation @xmath5 , i.e.    @xmath52    as recalled in the introduction , the choice of @xmath45 corresponds to the usual student-@xmath0 distribution and the prior above is the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "the following theorem states a crucial result to set @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the skewed student-@xmath0 distribution with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". then @xmath54 for every @xmath55 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can consider @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 we focus on the first term @xmath61^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}\\log\\left\\{\\frac{k(\\nu)\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\alpha}\\right)^2\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}}{k(\\nu+1)\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\nu+1}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\alpha}\\right)^2\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+2}{2}}}\\right\\}\\,dy.\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] the change of variable @xmath62 yields @xmath63^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}\\log\\left\\{\\frac{k(\\nu)\\left[1+\\frac{z^2}{\\nu}\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}}{k(\\nu+1)\\left[1+\\frac{z^2}{\\nu+1}\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+2}{2}}}\\right\\}\\,dz\\\\ & = 2\\alpha d_{\\leq}(f_{\\nu}^{0.5}\\parallel f_{\\nu+1}^{0.5 } ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] in a similar fashion @xmath64 the symmetry of the standard student-@xmath0 distribution ensures that @xmath65 therefore @xmath66 and we can easily conclude @xmath67    in a similar way , it can be proved that @xmath68 for every @xmath69 .",
    "the above result also holds when we assume that for @xmath70 , @xmath46 is the skewed normal distribution .",
    "these results lead to the following important considerations :    1 .   the objective prior distribution for @xmath1 does nt depend by the skewness parameter @xmath41 ; 2 .",
    "the objective prior distribution for @xmath1 for the skewed model is exactly the prior introduced in @xcite , i.e. @xmath71 .      the derivation of non - informative priors for the remaining parameters of the ast is straightforward .",
    "a common assumption is that the parameters are independent a priori .",
    "although this assumption can be relaxed , in the sense of limiting the independence to the one between the skewness parameter on one side and the location and scale parameters of the other side , the resulting overall prior is the same .",
    "in fact , if we consider @xmath4 independent from @xmath5 , the jeffreys independent prior will have the form @xmath73 .",
    "given that the jeffreys prior for a location parameter is proportional to 1 , and the jeffreys prior for a scale parameter is proportional to the inverse of the parameter , we would have @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "however , the above prior coincides with the reference prior for the pair @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming or not assuming prior independence between the location parameter and the scale parameter does not make any practical difference from an inferential point of view .",
    "for the skewness parameter @xmath41 , we will use the jeffreys prior discussed in @xcite , which is a beta distribution with both parameters equal to 1/2 ; that is @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , it can be seen in theorem 3 and corollary 3 of @xcite that the ( independence ) jeffreys prior for @xmath41 , under the parameterisation in , is precisely a beta distribution with both parameters equal to @xmath76 .",
    "in this section we present a simulation study of the prior for @xmath1 . due to the objective nature of the prior",
    "considered it is appropriate to present the frequentist properties of the yielded marginal posterior for the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , we analyse the frequentist mean squared error ( mse ) and the frequentist coverage of the @xmath77 credible intervals .",
    "the former represents a measure of the precision of the estimate , while the latter reports the proportion of times the true value is contained in the interval defined by the @xmath78 and the @xmath79 quantiles of the posterior in a repeated sampling scenario .",
    "the posterior distribution for @xmath1 tends to be skewed , as for example is shown in figure [ fig : single_samp ] ; as such , an appropriate index of the posterior which summarises its centrality is the median .",
    "furthermore , considering @xmath1 as discrete calls for an index which is discrete as well , i.e. the median . therefore ,",
    "the mse is computed with respect to the median , and the precision of the estimate is defined by the relative square root of the mean squared error from the median : @xmath80 .",
    "given that the model converges to the normal distribution for @xmath81 , it is more difficult to discern between ast densities with large values of @xmath1 . by considering the relative mse , we somehow counterbalance an otherwise naturally increasing mse and give a more interpretable information about the performance of the prior .    the posterior distribution for @xmath1 is obtained by marginalising the full posterior @xmath82 , where @xmath11 is the prior defined in and @xmath83 is the likelihood function defined in . as the posterior distribution is analytically intractable , we use monte carlo methods to obtain the marginal posterior distributions for each parameter . the algorithm employed is outlined in the appendix .    in this simulation study",
    "we consider the following scenarios .",
    "we noted that the location parameter and the scale parameter do not have any effect on the inferential results for the number of degrees of freedom , as such we have considered , without loss of generality , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have considered three different values of the skewness parameter , that is @xmath84 , @xmath45 and @xmath85 . for each of the above three values",
    "we have performed repeated sampling with @xmath86 .",
    "we have run 100000 iterations of the mcmc algorithm for each case , and for a sequence of sample sizes @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the simulation has been done in r language and it took about 5.4 hours per case in a cluster of computers with i7 processors .",
    "although the main fields of application of the asymmetrical @xmath0 density discussed in this paper call for relatively large sample sizes , we have also considered the possibility of applying the model to small numbers of observations .",
    "it is in fact for relatively small sample size that bayesian analysis tends to give better pay - off compared to the frequentist approach .",
    "therefore , beside considering @xmath89 , we have also analysed the frequentist properties for @xmath88 and @xmath87 .",
    "the prior used for the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the objective priors outlined in section [ sc_prelim ] which , as shown in @xcite and the references therein , yield proper posterior distributions .",
    "the simulation results are summarised in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the left column , plots ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , shows the square root of the relative mean squared error for the posterior medians of @xmath1 .",
    "while there is a dependence on the accuracy of the estimate from the sample size , we do not appreciate any effect from the value of the skewness parameter @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , within each plot on the left - hand - side , the mean squared error curves have a similar behaviour , with a higher value towards the region of the parameter space where contiguous number of degrees of freedom characterise distributions relatively different .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , leading to @xmath0 densities which are more and more similar to each other , the relative mean squared error decreases . as expected , the mean squared error in higher for small sample sizes than for larger sample sizes , given that more information is carried by the observations via the likelihood function .",
    "this is easily seen by moving from the top to the bottom of the left column of figure [ fig : figure1 ] , corresponding to sample sizes of , respectively , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the right column of figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows the frequentist coverage of the @xmath77 credible intervals for @xmath87 ( top ) , @xmath88 ( middle ) and @xmath89 ( bottom ) .",
    "although there is no apparent impact from different values of @xmath41 , we note more variable coverage values around the region of the parameter space associated with higher relative mean squared errors , compared to areas where the relative mean squared error is smaller .",
    "although this behaviour is common to any sample size , we see a shifting of the more uncertain area towards higher number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this last result is common to other bayesian objective methods to estimate @xmath1 , such as in @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the above conclusion can also be drawn by inspecting the posterior median credible intervals for @xmath1 , shown in table [ tab : median_intervals ] .",
    "in particular , the higher the value of the number of degrees of freedom , keeping the sample size fixed , the larger the interval . alternatively , the higher the sample size , for the same value of @xmath1 , the smaller the median credible interval .",
    "as expected , there is no appreciable difference in the median interval for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "+    .median @xmath77 credible intervals of the posterior of @xmath1 , for simulations with @xmath86 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note the following two important results . first , the skewness parameter is estimated to be close to 0.5 .",
    "this indicates that a symmetric model would be suitable for this data set .",
    "second , the estimated number of degrees of freedom is very closed to the upper bound of the parameter space .",
    "this is a clear indication that the data could be represented by a @xmath0 density with a high number of degrees of freedom or , which is equivalent , by a normal density .    for what it concerns the inferential results",
    ", we see that the credible intervals are relatively narrow , indicating a relatively strong posterior beliefs about the obtained estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : predus ] shows the posterior predictive density against the real data , where again we do not see any substantial difference between the two curves . as done in section [ sc_danish ] , we have performed monte carlo estimates of the data statistics fro the us loss data set . in particular , we have computed the mean , the standard deviation and the skewness index obtaining , respectively , 2.45 , 1.64 , -0.15 .",
    "these values can be compared with the ones in table [ tab : usloss1 ] .    ]",
    "an important aspect in analysis insurance loss data is their tendency to follow a skewed distribution and , because extreme events are not uncommon , to exhibit heavy tails .",
    "however , in some circumstances , symmetrical models with either non - heavy tails , like for example the normal distribution , or heavy tails , such as the @xmath0 density , may be effectively employed .",
    "usually , this type of modelling can be achieved by considering the data in the log - scale .",
    "although competing models could be estimated and assessed for their inferential and predictive performances , it is appealing to be able to consider a single model which , on the basis of the estimated values of some of the parameters , `` adjusts '' itself , in a sort of an automated fashion , to the problem under consideration .",
    "the asymmetrical student-@xmath0 considered in this paper to represent insurance loss data has the above flavour .",
    "in fact , the estimated value of the skewness parameter @xmath41 would suggest a symmetrical or non - symmetrical scenario , and the number of degrees of freedom would indicate the fatness of the tails of the data .    when dealing with a @xmath0 distribution , whether the usual symmetrical one or the one considered here , the estimation of the number of degrees of freedom has always been a challenge .",
    "it is not uncommon that the problem is somehow eluded by either setting @xmath1 on the basis of some appropriate theoretical results , or by consider different values and chose the most appropriate on the basis of some criteria .",
    "a bayesian approach , and in particular an objective bayesian approach , allows to obtain reliable estimates of the number of degrees of freedom with minimal initial input .",
    "we have here consider the number of degrees of freedom discrete and bounded above on the basis of the well known property of the @xmath0 density to converge to the normal distribution for sufficiently large @xmath1 . with this consideration ,",
    "we have been able to consider the objective prior for @xmath1 presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we prove here that the prior is not dependent on the value of the skewness parameter @xmath41 , therefore directly applicable to the model here considered .",
    "we have studied the frequentist properties of the posterior for @xmath1 yielded by the truncated objective prior . as expected from the analytical result discussed in section [ sc_priors ] , different values of the skewness parameter",
    "do not affect the performance of the prior , except regular small variations due to the randomness of the repeating sampling .",
    "as expected , the performance of the prior distribution , in terms of mse , improves when the sample size increases .",
    "the above results are in line with the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "we have then employed the discussed model to analyse real insurance loss data .",
    "the work has been carried out by using objective priors for each parameter of the model , to ensure a minimal information approach to the problem . in the first illustration",
    "we look to a well - known data set of losses due to fire in denmark .",
    "the peculiarity of the data is to show strong ( positive ) skewness and to have extreme values . even by considering the logarithmic transformation of the observations skewness and extremeness",
    "can not be removed .",
    "the inferential procedure shows the model adjustment to the scenario by resulting in an @xmath41 very close to zero and a number of degrees of freedom equal to 9 .",
    "the same bayesian model , i.e. sampling distribution and prior distribution , is applied to a different data set .",
    "this data set , which contains indemnity losses in the us market , shows skewness and extreme values as well , but these appear to be removed once the logarithm of the observations is considered .",
    "a posterior mean of @xmath45 indicates a symmetrical distribution , and a posterior median of @xmath92 indicates a distribution that is not very different from a normal density .",
    "the above two results show how the same model can be applied to insurance loss data sets , without the need to change neither any of of its components nor the prior distributions for the parameters .    to conclude , it is obvious that the same approach here illustrated can be adopted to other types of data , which exhibit similar characteristics of skewness .",
    "that is , the objective bayesian analysis of data by means of the ast model , including both the distribution and the priors for the parameters , can be generalised and employed in other disciplines , such as finance , environmental sciences and engineering , for example .",
