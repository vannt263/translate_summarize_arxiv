    "the far - infrared ( fir ) , all - sky survey conducted by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) revealed that roughly 15% of nearby main sequence stars have excess thermal emission due to the presence of circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "the thermal excess was first discovered around vega @xcite , and approximately 100 main sequence stars display the `` vega phenomenon '' @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of vega - like stars are typically fitted assuming disk - like distributions of grains @xcite , though in the optically thin regime the adopted geometry plays no role .",
    "assuming the grains orbit the host stars as circumstellar disks , the dust destruction timescales are typically one or two orders of magnitude shorter than the stellar ages .",
    "the existence of unseen parent bodies , exosolar analogs to kuiper belt objects , is inferred in order to replenish the dust complex via collisional erosion @xcite .",
    "high resolution imaging of vega - like stars has confirmed the existence of circumstellar debris disks around @xmath47 main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "however , the ratio of debris disks inferred from the fir seds , to those spatially resolved by imaging , is roughly 10:1 .",
    "here we present coronagraphic images of reflection nebulosity surrounding six main sequence stars previously identified as vega - like @xcite .",
    "the new data show dust morphology that is not disk - like , but qualitatively resembles the pleiades reflection nebulosity in five cases .",
    "dust scattered light detected around hd 123160 shares characteristics with nebulosities seen in both the pleiades and in star forming regions .",
    "we used an optical coronagraph at the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2 m telescope to obtain ccd images in the @xmath5-band ( table 1 ) .",
    "hd 123160 was also imaged in the @xmath6-band .",
    "reimaging optics gave 0.4@xmath0 per pixel , sufficient to nyquist sample the @xmath41.2@xmath0 full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the field of view was a circular region with diameter 5.5@xmath7 .",
    "follow - up observations were obtained in the near - infrared ( nir ) for hd 123160 using the lick observatory 3 m telescope ( table 1 ) . a 256@xmath8256 pixel ( 0.076@xmath0/pixel ) , coronagraphic ,",
    "near - infrared camera was used to artificially eclipse the central star with a 0.7@xmath0 wide finger @xcite .",
    "adaptive optics compensation @xcite using the primary star as a wavefront reference source improved image quality from @xmath41@xmath0 intrinsic seeing to @xmath40.16@xmath0 ( fwhm ) .",
    "our target sample was compiled from lists of vega - like stars published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we imaged all 22 vega - like stars from table 16 in @xcite , and 38 of the 60 stars from table viii in @xcite .",
    "the total sample of 79 stars ( the two tables have three stars in common ) includes several with resolved debris disks ( @xmath9 pic , vega , @xmath10 eri , and fomalhaut ) , two members of the pleiades ( 18 tau and 21 tau ) , and three herbig ae / be stars ( hd 34282 , hd 35187 , and hd 141569 ) .",
    "we also observed stars nearby in the sky and with magnitudes comparable to the science targets to be used later as template stars for psf subtraction .",
    "data reduction followed the standard steps of bias subtraction , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , image registration , and median - filtering of multiple frames to attain the effective integration times listed in table 1 .",
    "the psf of each science target was subtracted by using either template psfs discussed above , or by radially sampling the template psf , fitting the data with a 7th order polynomial , and producing an artificial psf from this fit .",
    "the psf subtraction step is useful for extracting faint nebulosity as close to the star as possible , but the nebulosities discussed here are detected in raw data .",
    "residual noise after the psf subtraction dominates the data @xmath41@xmath0 beyond the edge of the occulting spot .",
    "table 1 lists the radius centered on each target star below which we can not obtain reliable information about the circumstellar environment .",
    "the suppression of direct stellar light with the coronagraph reveals the presence of faint reflection nebulosity around the six vega - like stars in table 1 and fig .",
    "1 . the nebulosites have the following general properties : ( a ) spatial extent @xmath41@xmath7@xmath12@xmath7 radius ; ( b ) surface brightness varying as radius , @xmath11 , with @xmath9@xmath12 2 ; ( c ) range of surface brightness approximately 20 mag arcsec@xmath13 to 24 mag arcsec@xmath13 ; and ( d ) linear , filamentary , striated morphological structure , similar to that observed in the pleiades reflection nebulosities @xcite .",
    "the background noise , 3@xmath1424 mag arcsec@xmath13 , limits the radial extent to which each nebulosity is detected . table 1 gives the @xmath15 parallaxes , indicating heliocentric distances @xmath3100 pc for every star .",
    "the detected nebulosities therefore span spatial scales 10@xmath16 @xmath1 10@xmath17 au from their parent stars , and the occulted regions obscure the central @xmath410@xmath16 au ( table 1 ) .",
    "the nebulosity around hd 26676 ( fig .",
    "1d ) , the brightest and most extended , has been previously documented by @xcite and identified as a member of the tau r2 association @xcite , which is part of the pleiades .",
    "an examination of the literature indicates that the other five nebulosities were not previously known .",
    "the nebulosity around hd 123160 is characterized by a double - arm structure southeast of the star ( fig .",
    "1f ; features @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , rather than the linear features seen around the other five stars .",
    "arm - like morphologies appear near several pre - main sequence stars such as gm aur and z cma @xcite . the outside boundary of arm @xmath18 traces a closed curve that intersects feature @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is curved in the same direction as @xmath18 , indicating that @xmath20 may be a detached segment of @xmath18 .",
    "another diffuse , curved structure , @xmath21 , is 95@xmath0 from the star with position angle and curved morphology comparable to feature @xmath20 .",
    "neither @xmath20 nor @xmath21 have a core+halo structure that characterizes background field galaxies in these data .",
    "we also detect two point sources lying along a north - south axis and separated by 3.6@xmath0 at position @xmath22 .",
    "they are surrounded by a nebulosity that has a tail pointing towards hd 123160 .",
    "both are red , with @xmath23=1.7 mag and 1.1 mag for the north and south stars , respectively ( after applying the extinction correction determined for hd 123160 in table 3 ) . the colors of the northern component are consistent with a late - type stellar photosphere . however , the southern component has @xmath24=1.1 mag , indicating an additional source of near - infrared emission such as from a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows that two brightness knots exist within arm @xmath19 . in the k - band",
    "adaptive optics data , the north knot , @xmath25 , contains a point - like source 9.7 @xmath260.2@xmath0 from the star superimposed on the broader nebular emission . after subtracting an estimate for the background contributed by the broader nebulosity , the point - like source has @xmath6=16.5@xmath260.3 mag and @xmath27=14.2@xmath260.3 mag ( extinction corrected ; table 3 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 color is consistent with a k dwarf spectral type and distance modulus @xmath3100 pc .",
    "compared to the optical data , the adaptive optics @xmath27-band data probe closer to the star for any structure that may have a disk - like morphology .",
    "no circumstellar disk is detected as close as @xmath42.5@xmath0 from the primary .",
    "aperture photometry ( diameter = 4.0@xmath0 ) performed on the nebulosities labeled in figs .",
    "1f and 2 gives @xmath5 and @xmath6-band fluxes that decrease radially from the star with @xmath281 , rather than @xmath292 or @xmath293 that would characterize a homogenous medium or dust disk , respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath20 has 9% the flux of @xmath25 , but is 5 times farther from the primary . if both features are produced by grains with similar scattering properties , then @xmath20 has approximately twice as many scattering grains as @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath30 colors range from 0.0 to -0.2 mag after an extinction correction is applied . using @xmath5=7.81 mag for hd 123160 @xcite , @xmath30 = + 0.2 mag if hd 123160 is a g5v star , or",
    "@xmath30 = + 0.3 mag if it is a g0iii star .",
    "therefore the nebulous features in figs .",
    "1f and 2 appear bluer than hd 123160 , consistent with the scattered - light colors of the merope nebula @xcite .",
    "the discovery of nebulosity around these vega - like stars that is not disk - like raises the question of whether or not the dust emitting in the fir is contained in disks related to planet building , or merely due to dust contained in the ism .",
    "the `` pleiades phenomenon '' is due to the chance encounter of bright , nearby stars with a clump of ism @xcite .",
    "filamentary features in optical scattered light are produced by the shearing of the cloud as radiation pressure pushes dust around each star .",
    "our data do not necessarily exclude the existence of circumstellar disks in addition to the pleiades - like nebulosity because the observations are not sensitive to the central @xmath44@xmath0 radius ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , the main reason to presume the existence of a circumstellar disk is that the iras data give fluxes in excess of photospheric levels .",
    "if the pleiades - like dust detected here is capable of producing the fir emission , then the pleiades phenomenon is a more plausible explanation for the fir excesses than the vega phenomenon .",
    "below we test the validity of attributing the observed excess fir emission to an interstellar dust cloud encountering each of our target stars .",
    "to test if the iras far - infrared data are consistent with the pleiades phenomenon , we experiment with a model comprising a star embedded in a uniform number density , optically thin , dust cloud .",
    "the geometry is spherical , except that radiation pressure from the star excavates an axisymmetric paraboloidal cavity within the cloud , as described by @xcite .",
    "in spherical coordinates , ( r , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , a volume element is given as dv = dr @xmath8 r sin@xmath31d@xmath32 @xmath8 r d@xmath31 .",
    "the inner boundary of the cloud cavity has radius ,    @xmath33    the smallest radius that grains can approach the star , @xmath34 , depends on the relative velocity and the force of radiation pressure ( which scales with stellar luminosity and grain properties , such as size ) . for example , at a relative velocity of 12.2 km s@xmath35 , grains @xmath360.2 @xmath2 m in size will not approach vega closer than @xmath42000 au , whereas 1 @xmath2 m sized grains will reach as close as @xmath4200 au @xcite . in our simulations",
    "@xmath34 is a free parameter .",
    "grain temperatures are calculated in each volume element assuming grains receive blackbody radiation from the star , and emit as blackbodies .",
    "grain absorption and emission efficiences will depend on grain properties and wavelength regimes .",
    "we estimate the absorption and emission efficiencies empirically by assuming that they have the same functional form as the extinction function for interstellar grains given by @xcite in his table 1 .",
    "a smoothed version of this extinction function can be described by three power laws with form @xmath37 , where @xmath38=0 for @xmath39 0.5 @xmath2 m , @xmath38= 1.68 for 0.5 @xmath2 m @xmath40 5 @xmath2 m . and",
    "@xmath38=1.06 for @xmath41 5 @xmath2 m .",
    "very hot stars will put out their energy at short wavelengths where the grain absorption efficiency is at a maximum , whereas cool stars will not efficiently heat these interstellar grains .",
    "most of the energy re - radiated by grains will occur in the @xmath41 5 @xmath2 m regime , and therefore will have emission efficiency proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the dust cloud thermal emission is fitted to the observed iras fluxes by adjusting the grain number density , @xmath43 , the inner minimum radius of the cavity , r@xmath44 , and the outer radius of the cloud , r@xmath45 .",
    "the photospheric contribution from optical wavelengths through 12 @xmath2 m is fit by adjusting the stellar temperature , radius , and heliocentric distance . in the first iteration",
    "the stellar temperature and radius are taken from @xcite based on the spectral type for each star given in the literature .",
    "table 2 gives the observed optical , near - infrared , and far - infrared magnitudes and fluxes .",
    "interstellar reddening and extinction were calculated using both the b@xmath1v and v@xmath1k colors and is given in table 3 ; we used r@xmath46=3.1 for the total - to - selective extinction values given by @xcite in his table 1 .",
    "the color correction for the fir data was obtained from table vi.c.6 in the _ iras explanatory supplement version 2_. in table 4 we list the extinction - corrected optical and nir photometry , and the iras fluxes color - corrected based on the temperatures listed in table 1 . in several cases an alternate spectral type",
    "is proposed and the extinction and photometry are recalculated .",
    "we considered both the iras psc and the fsc data for fitting the model to the 12@xmath1100 @xmath2 m fluxes .",
    "the uncertainties for these data are given in the respective iras catalogs , with typical values @xmath410% .",
    "the heliocentric distances used in the first iteration are taken from the @xmath15 parallaxes for each star ( table 1 ) , but beyond 100 pc the @xmath15 distances have significant uncertainties .",
    "table 5 gives two examples of model fits to the sed of each star , and figs .",
    "3 - 10 display the model fits as discussed below .",
    "table 5 also lists the maximum grain temperature , t@xmath47 , the fractional infrared luminosity of the cloud , l@xmath48/l@xmath49 and the maximum optical depth , @xmath50 . for hd 4881 , hd 26676 and hd 49662 , the model fits to the 60@xmath1100 @xmath2 m emission gives a deficit of 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission .",
    "our simple model assumptions do not account for at least four factors that could enhance the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission .",
    "first , density variations exist within the dust cloud , as shown in the optical images ( fig .",
    "the theoretical model of @xcite also shows that a `` snowplow '' effect occurs as the dust moves around the cavity maintained by radiation pressure .",
    "a skin of higher density material will exist near the surface of the cavity .",
    "if we assume that the cavity is a sphere for simplicity , and displace the material that would have occupied the sphere to an annular skin with thickness @xmath51r = r@xmath52 - r@xmath44 , then the mass density in the skin is :    @xmath53    the larger the dust cavity produced by the star , the denser the skin layer for a fixed skin thickness . for example",
    ", @xmath43 is a factor of two greater in the skin compared to the ambient cloud for r@xmath44=200 au and r@xmath52=250 au , and a factor of 3 greater if we assume r@xmath44=500 au and r@xmath52=550 au .",
    "we find that including a high density surface layer in the model increases the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission slightly , but a good fit to the data requires a factor of @xmath410@xmath54 increase in dust density between the skin and the ambient material .",
    "thus , the enhanced 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission must have additional sources .",
    "second , larger grains ( @xmath551 @xmath2 m ) will not be pushed back by radiation pressure and will occupy the cavity @xcite .",
    "we find that filling the cavity with grains also does not succeed in fitting the observed 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission , given no increase in the density of material above the ambient medium ( table 5 ) .",
    "third , the smallest grains ( @xmath120.1 @xmath2 m ) will undergo non - thermal heating events to @xmath41000 k @xcite .",
    "the empirical finding for the pleiades is that the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission should represent @xmath430% of the total nebular fir flux @xcite .",
    "the iras sed s for four stars in the pleiades show that the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m flux densities lie significantly above a blackbody fitting the 60@xmath1100 @xmath2 m data @xcite .",
    "thus , a hot grain component could be present that will add 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m flux that is not accounted for by our model .",
    "however , the existence of small - grain heating should also produce observable nir excess emission and infrared emission features @xcite .",
    "fourth , our simulation does not take into account the existence of a circumstellar disk in addition to the ism nebulosity detected in this paper .",
    "material close to the star with number density decreasing with radius would add 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m flux to our model sed .",
    "future high resolution observations are required to detect number density variations closer to the star than our observations permit ( table 1 ) . in four cases below",
    "we discuss previous attempts to fit the sed s with model circumstellar disks .      before applying our model to the stars shown in fig . 1 , we test it on two pleiads that are in the iras psc and fsc , and have been identified as candidate vega - like stars @xcite .",
    "18 tau ( hd 23324 ) and 21 tau ( hd 23432 ) are both b8v stars with @xmath15 distances between 110 pc and 120 pc .",
    "two model fits to the sed of each star are given in figs . 3 and 4 , and table 5 . the parameters for models 18 tau - a are chosen to produce a sed that fits the psc 100 @xmath2 m data .",
    "model 18 tau - b demonstrates that a fit to the fsc 100 @xmath2 m point requires decreasing the mass density , @xmath43 , and increasing the outer radius , @xmath56 , relative to model 18 tau - a .",
    "however , no combination of parameters can fit the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m and the 60@xmath1100 @xmath2 m regions simultaneously , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest that the non - equilibrium heating of small grains may account for the observed excess flux in the iras 12 and 25 @xmath2 m passbands .",
    "the angular radii of models 18 tau - a and 18 tau - b would be 8@xmath7 and 21@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "@xcite measure 8@xmath7 radius for 18 tau in the iras infrared sky survey atlas ( issa ) .",
    "thus , model 18 tau - a is preferred over 18 tau - b .    for a straightforward comparison",
    ", the model fits to the 21 tau data use the same stellar parameters as the 18 tau models .",
    "model 21 tau - a fits the iras 60@xmath1100 @xmath2 m psc data and again demonstrates that a second source of 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission is necessary .",
    "relative to the 18 tau models , we decrease the inner radius to 10 au to show that the hotter grains do not add enough 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m flux to match the observations . however , the 60 @xmath2 m flux density for 21 tau in the iras fsc is significantly higher than in the psc .",
    "model 21 tau - b gives a fit to the fsc data that agrees with the entire observed 12 - 100 @xmath2 m sed .",
    "thus , the errors in any single fir data point may change the physical interpretation significantly .",
    "the angular radii of models 21 tau - a and 21 tau - b would be 8@xmath7 and 3.7@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "@xcite measure 5@xmath7 radius for 21 tau in issa maps .",
    "thus , model 21 tau - b is preferred over 18 tau - a .",
    "given the b9.5v spectral type for hd 4881 , our model gives optical - nir flux densities that lie well below the observed values if we assume the @xmath15 distance of 350 pc ( table 1 ) and t@xmath57=11,400 k. rather , the fit to the optical and nir data shown in fig .",
    "5 assumes d=168 pc and t@xmath57=12,300 k. the higher temperature is consistent with the @xcite reclassification of this star as b8 .",
    "the 25@xmath1100 @xmath2 m fluxes are fitted with the dust cloud parameters given in table 5 .",
    "figure 5 maps the spectral energy distributions of two model fits .",
    "fitting the 100 @xmath2 m photometry requires that r@xmath45 is not smaller than @xmath48.7@xmath810@xmath58 au . at the assumed distance , the model dust cloud subtends @xmath48.6@xmath7 radius , which is approximately equal to the average angular extent measured by @xcite in iras skyflux plates",
    "this is larger than the @xmath45@xmath7 radial extent measured by @xcite and @xcite , but a factor of two uncertainty in the measured angular extent has been demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we find that r@xmath44 may be varied between 1 au and 800 au with the resulting 25 @xmath2 m flux density contained within the iras psc and fsc data points , and with negligible effect on the 12 @xmath2 m flux density . at 12 @xmath2",

    "a poor fit to the 12 @xmath2 m flux was previously found in circumstellar disk models for hd 4881 @xcite , as well as models that assume spherical dust clouds @xcite . here",

    "the statistical significance of the poor model fit is therefore best evaluated after follow - up 10@xmath120 @xmath2 m observations can better constrain the photometry .",

    "this contrasts sharply against the subsequent @xmath60 parallax measurement that places hd 23362 at 352 pc .",
    "the derived visual extinction of @xmath42 mag ( table 3 ) is also inconsistent with the @xcite distance . in view of the high reddening , @xcite comment",
    "that the distance to hd 23362 should be determined independently and that the star may be misclassified .    in order to produce a closer match to the @xmath15 distance , we re -",
    "calculate the extinction values assuming the spectral type is k2iii , with t@xmath57=4200 and r=20r@xmath61 ( tables 3 and 4 ) .",
    "with this assumption we are then able to fit the optical and nir photometric data with a stellar blackbody at 187 pc ( table 5 , fig .",
    "the model dust cloud parameters are similar to those of hd 4881 , except that there is no disagreement between the model sed and the 12 @xmath2 m iras flux ( fig .",

    "we have no nir data for hd 26676 , but the nir data for hd 49662 is consistent with a purely photospheric origin .",
    "the scale of emission for models hd 26676-a and hd 49662-a , given the distances listed in table 5 , is @xmath45.5@xmath7 , which is consistent with the @xmath410@xmath7 radii measured by @xcite in iras skyflux plates .",
    "the photometric distance of 16 pc assuming that hd 123160 is a g5v star @xcite is inconsistent with the lack of parallax information from the @xmath15 and @xmath62 catalogs , and with the high extinction ( table 3 ) .",
    "though we confirm that the optical and nir data may be fit with a g5v star at 16 pc , a nearly equal model sed is obtained by assuming a g0iii star at @xmath4110 pc . for either spectral type the visual extinction exceeds 2 magnitudes ( table 3 ) . in fig .",
    "10 and table 5 we present dust cloud models assuming hd 123160 is a distant giant . however , further study of this system is necessary to determine its evolutionary status .",
    "lithium abundance measurements suggest that hd 123160 is relatively young , with age @xmath470 myr @xcite .",
    "this age is comparable to that of many vega - like stars as well as members of the pleiades .",
    "the nebulosities @xmath25 and @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "2 ) may originate from the same physical mechanisms that produce the ic 349 nebulosity near 23 tau in the pleiades @xcite .",
    "the semi - stellar appearance of @xmath25 is similar to the main knot in ic 349 @xcite , except that it is very red ( section 3 ) . on the other hand , the entire complex of nebulous features shown in fig .",
    "1f resembles a star - forming region where a young star illuminates its natal dust cloud .",
    "feature @xmath25 could be a k star associated with hd 123160 .",
    "the sed s produced by our pleiades cloud model fit the observed 12@xmath1100 @xmath2 m data points ( fig .",
    "10 ) , and the scale of emission for the models is @xmath41.5@xmath7 radius .",
    "this corresponds to the projected separation between hd 123160 and feature @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "4f ) . a circumstellar disk model used by @xcite , assuming",
    "hd 123160 is a g5v star at 16 pc , also gives satisfactory fits to the data .",
    "however , the present high resolution data ( fig .",
    "2 ) show no evidence for a circumstellar disk , and we therefore favor the pleiades cloud model .",
    "@xcite cautioned that thermal emission from reflection nebulosities such as in the pleiades may appear similar to thermal emission from vega - like stars .",
    "our simulations of interstellar grain emission demonstrate that the nebulae shown in fig .",
    "1 are capable of producing the excess thermal emission observed by iras . in three cases , a circumstellar disk or",
    "non - equilibrium small - grain heating may account for the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission .",
    "the latter mechanism is consistent with our current understanding of grain emission from the pleiades .",
    "a general problem in interpreting seds is that the models typically have as many adjustable parameters as there are data points .",
    "good fits are not persuasive by themselves to determine the distribution of the dust , especially when the dust is optically thin to absorption and emission . unlike the seds of young stellar objects ,",
    "the vega - like stars have strongly peaked far - infrared flux densities consistent with dust with a small range of temperatures .",
    "to interpret the dust distributions as lying in a single plane ( disks ) requires additional information , such as images of the scattered light .",
    "other authors have fitted the iras data for hd 4881 , hd 23362 , hd 23680 , and hd 123160 with circumstellar disk models , and in some cases interpreted excess emission at 100 @xmath2 m as due to infrared cirrus @xcite in the background . given the optical data and the results of our modeling",
    ", we argue that the infrared cirrus is local to each star , appearing as the pleiades phenomenon in scattered light . from the infrared standpoint",
    ", the term `` cirrus hotspot '' is used to describe the local heating of ism by a star . to qualify as cirrus hotspots",
    ", fir emission must be extended on arcminute scales with color temperatures between 25 k and 70 k @xcite .",
    "the early - type stars in the pleiades , for example , appear as cirrus hotspots in the iras data .",
    "the three b stars in our list , hd 4881 , hd 26676 , and hd 49662 , are also identified as infrared cirrus hotspots @xcite .",
    "our three b stars , as well as 18 tau and 21 tau from the original sample , are given as vega excess stars by @xcite in their table viii .",
    "we find that all but three of the remaining 29 b stars in the @xcite table are also identified as cirrus hotspots by @xcite .",
    "the two different interpretations for the same fir data illustrate the difficulty in uniquely identifying the origin of dust that produces excess thermal emission .",
    "for instance , @xcite identified vega - like stars if the color temperature satisfied 30 k @xmath64 500 k , which overlaps the color temperature criterion adopted by @xcite .",
    "however , the vega - like stars with resolved debris disks and rings ( e.g. @xmath9 pic , @xmath10 eri , fomalhaut , hr 4796a ) have heliocentric distances d@xmath36100 pc , whereas the stars discussed here are located at d@xmath3100 pc .",
    "thus the unique identification of thermal excess is problematic for the more distant objects . from our initial sample of 79 vega - like stars ,",
    "72 have @xmath15-detected distances , and of these 43 ( 60% ) have d @xmath3 100 pc . in part , the source confusion is a question of spatial resolution .",
    "resolved observations from the optical to the far - infrared are essential for determining the nature of circumstellar dust .",
    "however , the sun also lies within a relatively ism - free bubble 65@xmath1250 pc in radius @xcite .",
    "thus , the pleiades phenomenon naturally occurs with greater frequency among the more distant stars .",
    "though distance is a first order measure for the reliability of identifying the vega phenomenon , the local bubble has a non - spherical geometry , giving specific directions with respect to the sun that are most likely to contain denser ism that would produce the pleiades phenomenon .",
    "@xcite use the nai d - line doublet to measure absorption toward stars within 300 pc of the sun , and produce maps of neutral gas in three galactic projections . in figs .",
    "11 , 12 , and 13 , we plot the locations of vega - like stars using the same same galactic projections as @xcite . we take the 60 vega - like stars from @xcite table viii ( `` bright star catalog main - sequence stars with vega - like far - infrared excesses '' ) , and 73 vega - like stars from @xcite table 2 ( `` newly identified candidate main - sequence stars with debris disks '' )",
    ". two stars ( hd 73390 and hd 181296 ) in @xcite are in the @xcite table , leaving a total sample of 131 stars . from this sample",
    "we select the 111 stars that have @xmath15-detected distances .",
    "finally , a total of 85 vega - like stars lie within the three planes of reference defined by @xcite , and those within 300 pc of the sun are plotted in figs .",
    "we overlay two contours that trace the lowest and highest nai d2 absorption mapped by @xcite .",
    "the figure captions give more details .",
    "figures 11@xmath113 show that the walls of the local bubble approach the sun @xmath3650 pc in certain directions , but are @xmath3100 pc distant in other directions , particularly toward the north galactic pole ( fig .",
    "13 ; named the `` local chimney '' by welsh et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the galactic plane view ( fig .",
    "11 ) the local bubble has maximum extend toward @xmath65=225@xmath66 , which is also the direction toward hd 49662 .",
    "however , hd 49662 is located right on the wall of the high density gas .",
    "three more vega - like stars in fig .",
    "11 ( hd 52140 , hd 28149 and hd 108257 ) appear spatially associated with local overdensities of gas .",
    "figure 12 shows that hd 23680 is in the same general direction of hd 26676 and both are within the region of high - density gas .",
    "also evident is a group of five stars that trace the high - density wall at @xmath65=180@xmath66 , @xmath67 , d@xmath4125 pc .",
    "these vega - like stars ( hd 23324 = 18 tau , hd 23432 = 21 tau , hd 28149 , hd 28375 , hd 28978 ) are associated with taurus and the pleiades .",
    "two more groups of five stars each appear in fig . 12 . at @xmath65=0@xmath66 , @xmath67 , d@xmath450 pc",
    "we find hd 181296 , hd 191089 , hd 176638 , hd 181864 , and hd 181327 .",
    "these are not associated with gas , but hd 181296 and hd 181327 are members of the tucanae association @xcite . their youth and the lack of interstellar gas favors the vega phenomenon interpretation of their fir excesses .",
    "a third group of vega - like stars is evident at @xmath65=0@xmath66 , @xmath68 , 100 pc @xmath36 d @xmath36 150 pc ( hd 142096 , hd 142165 , hd 143018 , hd 145263 , and hd 145482 ) .",
    "these are at the distance and direction of the upper scorpius subgroup of the sco ob2 association @xcite which is encompassed by a giant reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "the association of these stars with large - scale dust and gas favors the pleiades phenomenon interpretation for the fir excesses .",
    "figure 13 shows that vega - like stars may be detected at the greatest distances with the least confusion from the ism in the direction of the north galactic pole .",
    "the figure also shows a group of four stars at @xmath65=90@xmath66 , @xmath67 , d@xmath420 pc ( hd 39060 = @xmath9 pic , hd 41742 , hd 53143 , and hd 67199 ) .",
    "their location in the local bubble and their association with @xmath9 pic favors the vega phenomenon explanation for their fir excesses .",
    "overall , the fraction of vega - like stars that lie at or beyond the local bubble wall ( thin contour ) is @xmath350% . in fig .",
    "11 we plot 40 vega - like stars , but only five are in the local bubble .",
    "the remainder are located at or beyond the wall of low density gas , and 16 of these are in high density gas regions .",
    "another 11 stars from the @xcite and @xcite tables would appear in fig .",
    "11 if we plotted distances between 300 and 600 pc . from the 30 vega - like stars plotted in fig .",
    "12 , 16 are in the high - density gas and 6 more lie between the high density and low density walls . in fig .",
    "13 , 6 vega - like stars are in the local bubble , 4 lie between the low and high density walls , and 4 more are found in the high density regions .    the post-@xmath15 distance determinations are not only useful for judging the position of vega - like stars relative to the local bubble , they also help evaluate the physical scale of thermal emission .",
    "we found that the @xmath15 parallaxes for hd 23362 , hd 23680 , and hd 123160 , as well as the large reddening values , probably place these stars beyond 100 pc , rather than 6@xmath116 pc , as determined in pre-@xmath15 investigations .",
    "the greater distances therefore explain how the thermal emission may originate from ism material extending 10@xmath16@xmath110@xmath17 au from each star and still meet the criteria for inclusion in the iras psc .",
    "the possibility that these stars are distant giants producing the pleiades phenomenon may help explain the infrared excesses observed around @xmath4100 luminosity class iii stars @xcite .",
    "we detect optical reflection nebulosity around six main - sequence stars that are candidates for having debris disks .",
    "five nebulae share the morphological characteristics of dust surrounding bright stars in the pleiades .",
    "the environment of hd 123160 has features that resemble both the pleiades and star forming regions .",
    "no disk - like structures are detected , though our optical coronagraphic technique does not probe the circumstellar environment closer than @xmath44@xmath0 radius .",
    "the sensitivity - limited radii of the nebulosities are between 1@xmath7 and 2@xmath7 and the radial measurements of surface brightness are consistent with uniform density dust clouds illuminated by the central star .    we show that thermal emission from an optically thin , uniform density dust cloud surrounding hd 23362 , hd 23680 , and hd 123160 can entirely explain the 12@xmath1100 @xmath2 m emission detected by iras .",
    "the pleiades phenomenon , a random encounter between a clump of ism and a star , is the most likely explanation for the excess fir emission . for hd 4881 , hd 26676 , and hd 49662 , the blackbody cloud model can not simultaneously fit the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m and 60@xmath1100 @xmath2 m regions of the iras - detected sed .",
    "these stars may have circumstellar disks in addition to the interstellar dust detected in the optical .",
    "however , the excess 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m emission may also arise from non - equilibrium heating of small grains .",
    "we show that 18 tau and 21 tau in the pleiades have comparable sed s with signatures of hot grains in the 12@xmath125 @xmath2 m fluxes .",
    "future observations sensitive to disk - like structure within 500 au of each star , and that search for nir excesses and emission features , are necessary to determine if these stars are manifesting the vega phenomenon and the pleiades phenomenon simultaneously .",
    "we find that most vega - like b stars have also been associated with fir cirrus hotspots .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath350% of vega phenomenon stars are located beyond the gas - poor local bubble , and many are spatially associated with regions of high density neutral gas .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of vega phenomenon stars beyond 100 pc may be confused with pleiades phenomenon stars .",
