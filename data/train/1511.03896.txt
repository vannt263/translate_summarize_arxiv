    "in a hydrodynamic calculation of a relativistic heavy ion collision , particles are emitted independently from a fluid element , and all information is thus contained in the single - particle momentum distribution .",
    "this momentum distribution is determined by the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic evolution , that is , the initial energy density profile and the initial fluid velocity profile .",
    "the fluid velocity at early times is itself mostly determined by the energy density profile at earlier times  @xcite , as shown by direct inspection of hydrodynamic equations  @xcite and strong coupling calculations  @xcite , so that all observables are to a very good approximation functionals of the sole initial density profile .",

    "[ fig : response ] .",
    "up to 30% centrality , smooth initial conditions and fluctuating initial conditions give very similar results for both @xmath44 and @xmath43 . above 30% centrality , the centrality dependence is stronger with fluctuating initial conditions than with smooth initial conditions . in particular",

    "the cubic response leaves the ratio unchanged for central collisions but increases it by up to 15% for peripheral collisions where it significantly improves agreement with experimental data  @xcite .    in a previous hydrodynamic study using as initial condition the ip - glasma model  @xcite",
    ", it was found that the distribution of @xmath0 matches experimental data for all centralities while the distribution of @xmath1 is too narrow for centralities above 35% .",
    "this observation is naturally explained by the cubic response .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratios ] shows that the fluctuations of @xmath1 are very similar with the ip - glasma model and with the monte - carlo glauber .",
    "the fact that linear eccentricity scaling alone underpredicts the ratio for peripheral collisions has also been noted previously  @xcite using monte - carlo glauber and mckln  @xcite models .",
    "it seems a generic feature of existing models of initial conditions .",
    "once the cubic response is taken into account , one expects models to be in better agreement with data on elliptic flow fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ fig : scatter ] shows that there is a significant dispersion of anisotropic flow for a given initial anisotropy , i.e. , a significant residual @xmath19 . for elliptic flow ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath49 is typically 10% of the value of @xmath0 , which is as large or larger than the cubic response .",
    "but unlike the cubic response , the residual averages to zero , so that its effect on measured quantities , which are averaged over many events , is small . for instance , its contribution to the mean square elliptic flow is proportional to @xmath62 , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the correction from the residual to the rms value of @xmath0 is typically less than 1% in relative value .     multiplied by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the average number of participants in the centrality bin , as a function of centrality percentile , for the same viscous hydrodynamic calculation as in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] .",
    "[ fig : residual ] ]    the residual @xmath19 is due to short - range fluctuations whose effect is not captured by the eccentricity @xmath8 .",
    "fluctuations in our calculation are due to the finite number of participant nucleons @xmath64 .",
    "therefore one naturally expects that the magnitude of @xmath19 scales roughly like @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : residual ] displays @xmath66 as a function of the centrality percentile from our viscous hydrodynamic calculation for @xmath13 .",
    "one sees that it varies by less than a factor 2 , while the number of participants varies almost by a factor 10 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath67 as a function of centrality percentile seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] can be ascribed to the larger damping of @xmath3 , relative to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that latexmath:[$\\langle |\\delta_n|^2|f_n|^2\\rangle=\\langle    centralities .",
    "this means that the magnitude of the residual is independent of that of the estimator , a property referred to as _",
    "homoscedasticity_.    finally , we have studied whether the distribution of @xmath19 is isotropic .",
    "the projection of @xmath19 parallel to the estimator @xmath18 corresponds to the dispersion in the magnitude @xmath41 , while the projection perpendicular to @xmath18 corresponds to the dispersion in the flow angle . for elliptic flow",
    ", we find a sizable anisotropy as the centrality percentile increases : @xmath69 ^ 2\\rangle > \\langle [ { \\rm im}(\\delta_2^ * f(\\varepsilon_2))]^2\\rangle$ ] , which means that the relative fluctuations of the flow magnitude with respect to the estimator are larger than the fluctuations of the flow angle .",
    "we find that the elliptic flow not only has a contribution from the usual linear response from the initial eccentricities but there is a nonzero cubic response that plays a strong role for mid - central to peripheral collisions , which highlights the importance of cubic response for large eccentricities .",
    "in fact , its contribution to the total elliptic flow is of order 10% at around 50% centrality .",
    "the existence of non - zero cubic response indicates that the distribution of @xmath0 is not homothetic to the distribution of @xmath1 , as usually assumed  @xcite .    because we consistently see this effect regardless of the scale of fluctuations and the type of viscosity ,",
    "we conclude that it is a general property of the hydrodynamic response .",
    "current calculations are for pb+pb collisions at @xmath27  tev , however , previous results at au+au rhic energies @xcite qualitatively appear to have nearly identical response .",
    "most likely smaller , asymmetric systems would display similar effects but they may see a larger influence from small scale structure  @xcite .",
    "the sum of the linear and cubic response is approximately constant across centralities so one would naively expect a simple explanation . note that this quantity corresponds ( see eq .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) ) to the limiting value of @xmath0 for @xmath70 , i.e , to the emission from a one - dimensional source . while both smoothed and event - by - event initial conditions see a non - zero cubic response , the magnitude of the each is quite different across centralities . with fluctuating initial conditions , the cubic response coefficient , @xmath43 consistently increases as a function of centrality percentile whereas it is roughly constant for smoothed initial conditions .",
    "thus , for event - by - event initial conditions the cubic response is large precisely in the region where the cubic response is most relevant .",
    "conversely , the linear response coefficient , @xmath44 , decreases across centralities at a steeper rate for event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "we conclude then that the cubic response depends on the detailed structure of initial conditions with a non - trivial dependence on the small scale fluctuations of the initial density profile , which deserves further investigations .",
