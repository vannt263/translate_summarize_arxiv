    "consider a leaf vertex @xmath356 in the tree @xmath327 corresponding to the vertex @xmath77 in @xmath7 and to the path @xmath88 in @xmath7 . since @xmath356 is a leaf vertex in @xmath327 , @xmath88 must end with a cycle at @xmath77 , say @xmath357 .",
    "since @xmath77 was exited in the west direction at the beginning of the 4-cycle , and since @xmath358 , the leaf vertex @xmath356 would be labeled occupied in weitz s construction , thus resulting in the removal of @xmath356 and its parent in the construction of @xmath355 .",
    "note , every vertex @xmath359 in @xmath327 of type @xmath360 has a child @xmath356 of type @xmath361 , and consequently @xmath359 ( and its subtree ) will be removed from the tree in the pruning process to construct @xmath355 .",
    "thus , after removing vertices of type @xmath360 ( and similarly , @xmath362 , @xmath363 and @xmath364 ) from @xmath327 , it is still the case that @xmath110 is a subtree of the resulting tree ( @xmath355 ) .",
    "this highlights why @xmath355 has a significantly smaller average branching factor than @xmath327 .",
    "we can define a branching matrix @xmath365 , with 17 types ( as illustrated in figure [ fig-17types ] ) , such that @xmath366 , and hence @xmath367 .",
    "we can prove the dms condition is satisfied for @xmath365 at @xmath368 , as we will describe shortly , which significantly improves upon our initial bound resulting from considering @xmath327 .     where @xmath369.,width=377 ]    a natural direction for improved results is to consider branching matrices corresponding to avoidance of larger cycles , while also accounting for the removal of vertices prescribed by the construction of weitz .",
    "we briefly outline such an approach for walks avoiding cycles of length at most 4 , 6 , and 8 , respectively . avoiding cycles of length @xmath370 results in @xmath371 types ,",
    "hence the computations become increasingly difficult for larger @xmath117 . for 8-cycles the task of finding appropriate parameters to satisfy the conditions of theorem [ cor : dms ] is still feasible .",
    "more precisely , we can define branching matrices @xmath372 for @xmath373 , that ( i ) represent the structure of trees of walks avoiding cycles of length @xmath374 , as well as ( ii ) account for the removal of vertices based on children being labeled ` occupied . '",
    "one can extend the above construction of @xmath365 for general @xmath375 by using types encoded by longer paths with length at most @xmath370 and ruling out the types that either contain a cycle of length at most @xmath370 or whose children end up being labeled occupied .",
