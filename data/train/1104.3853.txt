    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite is a well - known technique in many - body physics .",
    "it can be considered as the next step after the mean field approximation ( mfa ) , being able to describe in a rather simple way some of the effects induced by the residual interaction , such as collective excitations @xcite . in this work",
    "we want to examine its application to the problem of evaluating pairwise type entanglement in general composite systems invariant under translations , such as cyclic spin chains with long or short range couplings in a uniform magnetic field , at both zero and finite temperature .",
    "the fundamental importance of quantum entanglement in different areas of physics is well recognized , constituting an essential resource for quantum information science @xcite and providing a deeper understanding of quantum correlations in many - body and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the evaluation or even the estimation of entanglement in interacting many - body systems is in general not an easy task , particularly for long range couplings and finite temperatures , lying beyond the scope of basic methods like the mfa which rely on separable trial states .    here we will show that the mf+rpa can provide a simple general method for estimating pairwise entanglement , with a complexity which does not exceed that of solving a _ local _ mf+rpa problem in the case of translationally invariant systems with uniform mean fields .",
    "its accuracy actually increases for long range interactions or high connectivity , i.e. for situations where numerical techniques for evaluating ground states of spin chains ( like quantum monte - carlo @xcite , dmrg @xcite and methods based on matrix product states @xcite ) become normally more complex to apply or less accurate . in any case",
    "it allows for a rapid estimation of the main features and their behavior with the control parameters , leaving the application of more accurate approaches for a second step .",

    "its ability to reproduce pairwise entanglement in more general systems was , however , not examined .",
    "we will first briefly revisit the general mf+rpa formalism derived from the path - integral representation of the partition function , discussing its implementation in composite systems and in particular in those which are translationally invariant .",

    "comparison with numerical exact results is made for finite chains with anisotropic @xmath0 interactions of distinct ranges .",
    "the method is able to capture most essential features of the entanglement between two arbitrary spins away from mf critical regions , becoming accurate for strong magnetic fields , where it provides an analytic description of the concurrence . at weak fields the agreement with exact results is less accurate but improves as the interaction range increases , being as well able to predict the appearance of a factorizing field @xcite and an infinite entanglement range in its vicinity .",

    "<S> we discuss a general mean field plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) for describing composite systems at zero and finite temperature . we analyze in particular its implementation in finite systems invariant under translations , where for uniform mean fields it requires just the solution of simple local - type rpa equations . as test and application , </S>",
    "<S> we use the method for evaluating the entanglement between two spins in cyclic spin 1/2 chains with both long and short range anisotropic @xmath0-type couplings in a uniform transverse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is shown to provide an accurate analytic description of the concurrence for strong fields , for any coupling range , pair separation or chain size , where it predicts an entanglement range which can be at most twice that of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it also correctly predicts the existence of a separability field together with full entanglement range in its vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> the general accuracy of the approach improves as the range of the interaction increases . </S>"
