    "our knowledge of neutron star interiors is still uncertain .",

    "the matter consists of only nucleons and leptons .",
    "when the density is higher than @xmath5 , the equation of state ( eos ) and composition of matter are much less certain .",
    "the presence of hyperons in neutron stars has been studied by many authors  @xcite . @xmath6",
    "condensation in dense matter was suggested by kaplan and nelson  @xcite and has been extensively discussed in many works  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the quark matter may exist in the core of massive neutron stars , and the hadron - quark phase transition can proceed through a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter  @xcite .",
    "if deconfined quark matter does exist inside stars , it is likely to be in a color superconducting phase  @xcite , and various color superconducting phases have been intensively investigated in recent years  @xcite .",
    "baryon pairing is believed to play an important role in the evolution of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the presence of neutron superfluidity in the crust and the inner part of neutron stars can be considered well established  @xcite .",
    "the neutron fluid in the crust probably forms a @xmath0 superfluid . with increasing density , the @xmath0 interaction turns repulsive , and the neutrons in the outer core mainly form a @xmath7 superfluid . on the other hand",
    ", one can expect @xmath0 proton pairing in the outer core because the small proton fraction brings about a low proton density in this region . in the inner core of neutron stars",
    ", hyperons may appear through the weak interaction because of the fast rise of the baryon chemical potentials with density .",
    "it is widely accepted that hyperons appear around @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of hyperons tends to soften the eos at high density and lower the maximum mass of neutron stars  @xcite as well as increase the neutron star cooling rate  @xcite . in general , the first hyperon to appear is @xmath1 , which is the lightest one with an attractive potential in nuclear matter . the potential of @xmath8 hyperons is now considered to be repulsive ; therefore @xmath9 appears at a higher density than @xmath1 in neutron star matter  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 superfluidity of @xmath1 hyperons is suggested to occur in the same way as that of neutrons arising from the attractive @xmath2 interaction in the @xmath0 channel  @xcite .",
    "it is known that hyperon pairing can significantly affect the thermal evolution of neutron stars by suppressing neutrino emission from the hyperon direct urca process  @xcite .",
    "young neutron stars cool primarily by neutrino emission from the interior . as discussed in refs .",

    "this process is exponentially suppressed when @xmath12 , and it is much less efficient than the direct urca process  @xcite .",

    "we have studied the @xmath0 superfluidity of @xmath1 hyperons in neutron star matter and neutron stars . in this article",
    ", we employ the rmf model with the parameter sets tm1 and nl3 to calculate the properties of neutron star matter , which is composed of a chemically equilibrated and charge - neutral mixture of nucleons , hyperons , and leptons .",
    "the rmf theory has been successfully and widely used for the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei , including unstable nuclei . in the rmf approach ,",
    "baryons interact through the exchange of scalar and vector mesons .",
    "the baryons considered in this article are nucleons ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and hyperons ( @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the exchanged mesons include isoscalar scalar and vector mesons ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , an isovector vector meson ( @xmath30 ) , and two additional hidden - strangeness mesons ( @xmath31 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is well known that the meson - hyperon couplings play an important role in determining the properties of neutron star matter .",
    "we have used the couplings constrained by reasonable hyperon potentials that include the updated information from recent developments in hypernuclear physics . to examine the @xmath0 pairing of @xmath1 hyperons ,",

    "we have calculated the @xmath0 pairing gap of @xmath1 hyperons at the fermi surface , @xmath109 , using the @xmath2 potentials adopted in this article .",
    "it is found that @xmath109 depends both on the @xmath2 interaction and on the treatment of neutron star matter .",
    "the maximal @xmath109 obtained in the present calculation is about 0.8 mev with the esc00 potential in the tm1 case .",
    "this is because the esc00 potential has the strongest attraction among the @xmath2 interactions used in this article .",
    "the nd1 and nd2 potentials yield somewhat smaller @xmath109 of the order of @xmath116@xmath117 mev . for the nsc97e ,",

    "the @xmath1 pairing does not appear for the nsc97b and nsc97f potentials .",
    "the difference in these results reflects the dependence of @xmath109 on the @xmath2 interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude and the threshold density of @xmath109 are also dependent on properties of neutron star matter , especially on the effective mass and particle fraction of @xmath1 hyperons . in the case of tm1 ( nl3 ) with the esc00 potential ,",
    "the threshold density of @xmath109 is around @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , reaches a maximum value at @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , and finally vanishes at @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . by solving the tov equation ,",
    "we have calculated neutron star properties and found that whether the @xmath3 superfluidity of @xmath1 hyperons exists in the core of neutron stars mainly depends on the @xmath2 interaction used . with stronger @xmath2 interactions , such as esc00 , nd1 , and nd2",
    ", the @xmath1 superfluidity may exist in massive neutron stars .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath1 superfluidity can exist in neutron stars with the nfs , nsc97s , and urbana interactions , which have simulated the experimental value of @xmath108 from the nagara event .    in this article , we have considered the updated information from recent developments in hypernuclear physics and used the weak attractive @xmath2 interactions suggested by the nagara event .",
    "however , there are still large uncertainties in the hyperon - hyperon interaction and the eos of neutron star matter .",
