    "this goes beyond the temperature analysis in the resonant case because in the former , only @xmath217 entered into the relaxation rate whereas , for strong detuning , the environmental spectrum is probed at multiple , distinct frequencies .",
    "the analysis here is fully similar to that of cooling and heating of oscillators @xcite , the area that attracted much interest recently @xcite .",
    "we note that , in contrast to the previous work , here we consider heating and cooling of a two - level system , a qubit , that results from the coupling to an oscillator rather than heating and cooling of the oscillator that may result from such coupling provided the relaxation rate of the qubit is higher than that of the oscillator .",
    "if @xmath218 , the qubit temperature @xmath219 exceeds @xmath220 , whereas for @xmath221 we have driving - induced cooling of the qubit , @xmath222 ; for @xmath223 the temperature @xmath224 is negative . heating and cooling of the qubit can be achieved also for nonresonant excitation of the oscillator @xcite .    for weak driving and @xmath1 far from @xmath8 , qubit decay may be due to two - quanta transitions in which an oscillator makes a transition between its neighboring levels and a quantum of the bath is created or annihilated ( for stronger oscillator - bath coupling , two bath quanta transitions may be also important ) .",
    "the corresponding rate is determined by @xmath225 , where @xmath226 . here , function @xmath215 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonresonant_decay ] ) ( except that @xmath2 should be replaced with @xmath4 ) , whereas @xmath227 for @xmath228 and @xmath229 for @xmath230 .",
    "this expression coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadrate ] ) for @xmath231 .",
    "the results on nonresonant oscillator - mediated decay can be extended also to the case of linear qubit - oscillator coupling , with coupling energy @xmath232 . in this case",
    "@xmath233 $ ] .",
    "the decay rate is independent of the attractor occupied by the oscillator .    due to the factor @xmath234 in @xmath235 , i.e. the particular choice of working point ,",
    "the dephasing rate of the qubit is several orders of magnitude larger that the relaxation rate , allowing for a good , near - qnd , qubit detection .",
    "in conclusion , the presented approach describes the relaxation of a qubit coupled to an underdamped driven quantum oscillator , both in the regime where the qubit transition frequency @xmath1 resonates with the oscillator frequency or its second overtone and where it is far away from resonance .",
    "the proposed mechanism shows to what extent quantum measurements with bifurcation amplifiers are of the nondemolition type .",
    "the qubit relaxation rate is expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the oscillator .",
    "we find this power spectrum in the explicit form near resonance where , as we show , it can have a double - peak structure as function of frequency .",
    "this result and the proposed method are general for a nonlinear oscillator , and thus go beyond the problem of qubit relaxation .",
    "both in the resonant and nonresonant regimes the qubit decay rate strongly depends on the attractor the oscillator is latched to .",
    "far from resonance , including the experimentally important range of a high qubit frequency , and for the coupling quadratic in the oscillator coordinate the qubit decay rate is quadratic in the amplitude of the oscillator s forced vibrations .",
    "for @xmath1 close to @xmath8 , the decay rate is resonantly enhanced . for a strongly underdamped oscillator it displays narrow maxima as a function of the control parameters once @xmath236 goes through the appropriate oscillator quasienergy , which depends on the attractor .",
    "we observe that the decay mediated by a driven oscillator changes the qubit temperature , leading to heating , cooling , or population inversion depending on the frequency detuning . in the case of linear qubit - oscillator coupling",
    ", the qubit relaxation rate does not contain the squared vibration amplitude as a multiplying factor , but for @xmath1 close to @xmath4 it displays attractor - dependent quasienergy resonances .",
