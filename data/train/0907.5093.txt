    "the recent measurements of the local cosmic - ray electron and positron fluxes have stimulated a lot of interest in the cosmic - ray field .",
    "the sharp rise in the positron fraction detected by pamela  @xcite seems a clear indication of the existence of a nearby positron source in addition to the secondary positron component due to the interaction of primary species with the interstellar medium along propagation .",
    "the very recent high - statistic measurement by fermi  @xcite of the all - electron flux ( namely the flux of electrons plus positrons without charge discrimination ) , while not confirming previous hints of an anomalous peak by atic  @xcite and ppb - bets  @xcite , has found a spectral index sensibly harder than the one inferred from past extrapolations for the electron spectrum based on lower energy ( and less accurate ) data . such a picture leaves room for a substantial contribution from unconventional ( or previously disregarded ) lepton sources , and it is very tempting to consider the possibility that a large component of the positron and electron flux is provided by the pair annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) particles , possibly forming the dm halo of the milky way ( for early proposals in this direction see , e.g. ,  @xcite ; for reviews on indirect dm detection see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the latest fits of the data with such a component , see , e.g. ,  @xcite confirm that this picture is viable .",
    "two general features of the dm - induced source were well - known even from early analyses : i ) to match the level of the positron background , the local pair annihilation rate needs to be much larger than the one expected for thermal dm weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , within standard assumptions for the universe thermal history and the local dm distribution ; ii ) having normalized the annihilation rate to the observed positron flux , there are very stringent bounds on the wimp model from measurements of the local antiproton flux , disfavouring annihilation modes giving rise to a hadronic yield , and favouring the leptonic channels .",
    "dm models fulfilling these requirements have been proposed recently , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . for what concerns the first requirement",
    ", they mainly focus on a mechanism to account for a mismatch between the thermally averaged annihilation cross section at the freeze - out in the early universe and a much larger annihilation cross section in the halo today .",
    "alternatively , one could invoke an enhancement in the positron signal based on the presence of a local population of dense dark matter substructures , with the pair annihilation rate being large because the average of the number density of dm pairs is much greater than one half of the square of the mean dm number density ( i.e. , in terms of the local dm halo density @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "when considering an average effect within many realizations of the milky way substructure population as extrapolated from current @xmath2cdm numerical n - body simulations , the mean enhancements in the local cosmic - ray fluxes are typically very modest , possibly below a factor of few  @xcite .",
    "large effects , at the level needed to account for pamela and fermi data , have been claimed instead in connection to a ( few ) single , very dense , nearby substructure(s )  @xcite ; the price to pay in this case is that one has to refer to a configuration with a very small realization probability according to the n - body simulations , or to rely on a subhalo picture which is less standard .    both in discussing average effects from a full subhalo population and in tracing the effect of individual substructures ,",
    "the approach of the recent papers and the vast majority of papers in the literature has been to ignore the fact that one is dealing with a system which is not static , and the emission and propagation of charged particles has been treated in the steady state limit . the distribution of substructures in the galaxy is not rotationally supported ; their typical velocity can be estimated from the total mass density profile of the milky way .",
    "assuming for simplicity spherical symmetry for the galaxy and an isothermal sphere for the subhalo phase - space distribution function , the velocity dispersion for such a distribution is simply equal to @xmath3 times the value of the circular velocity  @xcite , i.e. , assuming 250  km  s@xmath4 for the local rotational speed  @xcite , about 300  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "an object moving at such speed on an orbit perpendicular to the galactic plane has a time of crossing of the diffusive halo region for cosmic - rays , say a cylinder with a 4  kpc half - height , of about @xmath5  s. such value is comparable to the typical confinement time for cosmic rays as estimated in the simplified `` leaky - box '' propagation models , and to the energy loss timescale for electrons and positrons  @xcite .",
    "this is clearly just a qualitative argument ( actually not even referring to the most appropriate quantities , see the discussion below ) to illustrate that the effect of proper motion of dm substructure can be relevant .",
    "indeed , we will show that there is the possibility that local antimatter measurements reflect a transient due to dm annihilations in a subhalo , rather than a source to be modeled in the steady state limit .",
    "the paper discusses the main features of the local antimatter fluxes resulting from individual dm substructures , taking proper motion into account .",
    "analytic solutions for the propagation equation , as appropriate for positrons and antiprotons / antideuterons , are presented taking into account the most relevant terms , referring to a simplified description of the diffusion region , the interstellar medium and radiation field ( these are the same kind of assumptions which are usually implemented for dm studies in the steady state limit , as well as , most often , to discuss electron / positron fluxes from astrophysical sources ) .",
    "we show results in a few benchmark configurations for the propagation parameters and for the orbit of the dm source .",
    "we introduce a few sample possible interpretations for the pamela and fermi positron / electron data , illustrating how sensitive one becomes to different assumptions .",
    "in particular , we show that , contrary to the picture extensively discussed in recent analyses , it is no longer true that one can extract from the data , in a unique way , model independent particle physics observables , such as the dm mass , the pair annihilation cross section and the annihilation channel .",
    "we also consider the gamma - ray signals associated to this scenario and compare with current limits as well as with the detection prospects in the upcoming future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : crprop ] , we present the description of the particle propagation in the galaxy . we discuss point - like dm substructures as sources of positrons and compare to pamela and fermi data in section  [ sec : positronpoint ] and [ sec : positrondata ] , respectively .",
    "the contribution to the antiproton flux is presented in section  [ sec : antiproton ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "extra ] , we compute other detectable extra features of the electron / positron flux , such as the associated radiative emission and the dipole anisotropy of the spectrum . section  [ sec : concl ] concludes .",
    "details on the solution of the transport equation for positrons and antiprotons are reported in the appendix .",
    "the random walk of charged cosmic - rays in the turbulent and regular component of the galactic magnetic fields is usually treated through an effective description . defining @xmath6 the number density per unit total particle momentum of a given particle species ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath7 is the number of particles in the momentum interval @xmath8 ) , the propagation equation can be casted in the general form ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath9     - \\frac{n}{\\tau_f } - \\frac{n}{\\tau_r}\\ , .",

    "we will follow the second route , implementing however solutions of the diffusion equations valid for positron or antiproton primary sources which are non - stationary .",
    "as commonly done , we will assume a spatially constant diffusion coefficient and introduce a spatial average for the positron / electron energy loss rate ; we will also neglect both convection and reacceleration , sketching the relative energy dependent effects through an appropriate choice of the momentum scaling of the spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "this very simplified scheme , which is flexible enough to introduce many study cases without neglecting any of the physical effects we wish to discuss , can actually be sufficient for a fair description of some of the key observables in cosmic - ray physics .",

    "the diffusion region is treated as a cylinder extending from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in the vertical direction , with standard primary sources in a thin layer around @xmath28 , and up to @xmath29 in the radial direction ; in the example of ref .",

    "we label this parameter choice as `` model a '' , and take it as reference benchmark case .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the dependence of our results on the propagation model is clearly beyond the scope of this paper ; the main trends we will present are essentially insensitive to slight readjustments in the parameter space .",
    "one of the most relevant parameters for our discussion is the vertical size of the propagation region @xmath36 .",
    "it is well known that the local measurements of secondary to primary ratios are mostly sensitive to @xmath37 rather than to each of the two parameters .",
    "the degeneracy would be broken by local measurements of the so - called `` radioactive clocks '' , namely unstable secondaries , such as @xmath38be as compared to @xmath39be .",
    "such data are however not very accurate at present .",
    "we consider two extreme setups : a thin halo model with @xmath40  kpc and a thick model with @xmath41  kpc ; @xmath42 is rescaled to , respectively , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath45 as we find simulating this model with galprop and refitting the b / c ratio ( reduced @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; the thin halo model is labeled as `` model b '' , while the thick one as `` model c '' ) . within these models the local primary proton and electron fluxes",
    "are reproduced as well ( for the electron injection spectrum we take a spectral index of 2.30 at high energy , i.e. above @xmath48  gev ) .",
    "the spectra obtained with galprop in our reference cases will be used to as background estimates in the next sections ; the local electron and positron flux are computed with the spatially - dependent energy loss terms following from the standard templates for the interstellar radiation field and the magnetic field profile as implemented in the code .",

    "furthermore , there are potentially other relevant issues which we do not address in our simplified approach .",
    "e.g. , we expect some dependence of the results on how boundary conditions are treated in the diffusion model : we are adopting here the standard approach of a spatially constant diffusion coefficient and free escape ( i.e. the diffusion coefficient going to infinity ) as a sharp transition at the vertical boundaries ; this is the same approach followed , e.g. , in galprop .",

    "this is due to the fact that there is no fresh source of high energy electrons and positrons , and the ones injected along the transit of the source through the diffusion region have rather rapidly degraded their energy .",
    "therefore , there is no efficient high energy source to up - scatter starlight photons to @xmath125-ray frequency .",
    "the trend is probably exaggerated by the fact that we are assuming a sharp boundary for the propagation region , while a smoother boundary condition would be certainly more physical and would probably lead to a smoother transition between the cases , @xmath111  kpc to the @xmath169  kpc .    from the sample case",
    "discussed , we can infer that it is rather likely that if the local positron flux receives a sizable contribution from a single point - source , the induced ic flux is a relevant target for the fermi @xmath125-ray telescope .",
    "a more thorough discussion about this point is delayed to an upcoming dedicated analysis .      as pointed out by recent analyses",
    "( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) , a single nearby point - like source ( e.g. , a pulsar ) , being the dominant local positron source at high energy , induce an anisotropy which could be at a detectable level .",
    "in this section , we reconsider this possibility in the context of dm substructure .",
    "we take into account proper motion effects , which are not relevant for bursting - like sources as pulsars .",
    "we assume the dominant contribution to the anisotropy to be given by the dipole term . in order to detect an anisotropy along a certain direction at a good confidence level",
    ", the required number of events has to be very large .",
    "therefore , although the anisotropy in the positron spectrum would be higher than in the total electron plus positron spectrum , we refer to the latter , being the detection prospects for fermi much more promising than for pamela .",
    "if the anisotropy is dominated by the dipole term , the intensity at a given point as a function of the direction of observation has only one maximum .",
    "the degree of dipole anisotropy can be defined by the quantity @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the maximum and minimum @xmath173 intensity with respect to direction . expanding the intensity in spherical harmonics up to the dipole term",
    ", we have : @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the angle with respect to the direction of maximal anisotropy , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 and @xmath178 are angle - independent coefficients . note that contrary to the case of a stationary point - source ( with homogeneous and isotropic propagation parameters ) , the @xmath179-dependent terms of the dipole are not null .",
    "although the direction of maximal anisotropy ( chosen , e.g. , as the @xmath180-axis ) is , in general , unknown , we can define the particle flux @xmath181 along such direction by integrating over all the possible directions the projection over @xmath180 of the intensity , i.e. , @xmath182 , and by estimating it as @xmath183 .",
    "the latter is obtained in the diffusion approximation  @xcite , but it is valid at first order ( i.e. , for small anisotropies ) also when including energy losses .",
    "moreover , we assume the anisotropies in directions orthogonal to @xmath180 to be subdominant ( i.e. , @xmath184 ) . by equating the two expressions for @xmath181",
    ", one gets  @xcite : = = , [ eq : anis ] where @xmath185 denotes the contribution to the @xmath173 number density induced by a dm substructure , @xmath186 is the contribution from cosmic - rays , and @xmath187 .    neglecting boundary conditions ,",

    "[ eq : epnsol ] : |n_dm(r , p , t)| = ^1/2 , [ eq : anis2 ] with @xmath95 obtained from @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 , respectively .    .",
    "]    we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : anis ] , the degree of dipole anisotropy for the benchmark dm scenarios in table  [ tab : fit ] . comparing models 3 and 4 , describing sources at analogous distance and with analogous local spectrum",
    ", one can note that , as intuitive , an approaching source would induce a higher anisotropy than a moving - away source ( both on a straight - line trajectory ) . on the other hand , for sources at moderate distance",
    "the mismatch is quite small and the picture is similar to the stationary case .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is strongly and inversely correlated to the diffusion length ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : anis2 ] ) .",
    "although the benchmark dm models 1 and 2 induce a very similar local spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pamela1 ] ) and describe substructures moving away from us on a vertical trajectory at the same velocity , in the second case the electrons and positrons undergo a greater diffusion before reaching us , and the anisotropy is suppressed with respect to the first case .",
    "note that the maximum of the curves in fig .",

    "[ fig : anis ] can be observable by fermi in few years of data taking .",
    "on the other hand , the predictions for the anisotropy associated to a dm substructure suffer of many theoretical uncertainties , as in the case of the spectrum , and , depending on the trajectory , the degree of anisotropy can be suppressed or slightly enhanced with respect to an analogous ( i.e. , at analogous distance from the observer ) stationary point - like case .",
    "we have discussed the contribution to the local antimatter fluxes due to individual wimp dm substructures , accounting for the substructure proper motion . we have derived analytic solutions to the propagation equation as appropriate for a time - dependent positron and antiproton primary sources , identifying the relevant quantities to discriminate whether proper motion effects are relevant or not .",
    "we found that , for both positrons and antiprotons , the static limit is a fair approximation only in the case of high energy particles and nearby sources , while it fails in all other situations .",
    "the discussion has involved a few benchmark dm candidates and and a few sample orbits for the substructure .    as an application of the general discussion , we focused first on wimps annihilating into leptons only , and we derived sample fits of the pamela positron excess and fermi all - electron data .",
    "the fits have been obtained starting from some arbitrary values of the wimp mass , demonstrating that , for a single non - static dm point - source , it is no longer true that one can extract from the data , in a unique way , as extensively done in recent analyses , model independent particle physics observables , such as the dm mass , the annihilation yield and the pair annihilation cross section . indeed",
    ", the threshold of the local electron / positron spectrum can not be used as a sure indicator of the dm particle mass , being possibly set by the distance of the dm substructure .",
    "the relation between the shapes of the injection spectrum and of the propagated spectrum is not straightforward for a non - static dm substructure , which behaves as a transient source .",
    "moreover , the annihilation rate depends on the product of the pair annihilation cross section times the unknown annihilation volume of the substructure , rather than on @xmath192 only .",
    "the pamela positron excess can be explained in such a scenario , provided that a large annihilation rate in the substructure is considered .",
    "this requires either a large annihilation volume ( much larger than typical values predicted for dm substructures in n - body simulations , but viable for scenarios accounting for the adiabatic formation of an intermediate mass black hole in the substructure ) and/or a pair annihilation cross section significantly enhanced with respect to the reference thermal value .",
    "we have then used pamela and fermi electron / positron data to derive , under different configurations , limits to the total annihilation rate in the dm source .",
    "these limits have been compared to the bounds extracted from the @xmath125-ray luminosities associated to the same dm models .",
    "the general trend is that the @xmath125-ray signal induced by a dm point - source , giving a sizable contribution to the local positron flux , is below the level of the brightest unidentified egret sources , but well above the fermi @xmath125-ray telescope sensitivity .",
    "we have also discussed wimp models giving raise to an antiproton yield through pair annihilations in the substructure , as in the case with @xmath193 as final state of annihilation .",
    "analogously to the electron / positron case , single dm sources inducing a significant contribution to the local antiproton flux can be detected by fermi in @xmath125-rays ( on the other hand , as for the smooth dm halo component , a positron / electron flux at the level of pamela and fermi data can be hardly obtained in such wimp models without violating antiproton limits ) .    finally , we sketched two further features in connection to positron / electron emission from a dm point - source , namely the spectral and angular shape of @xmath125-ray flux induced by inverse compton emission on starlight , and the dipole anisotropy in the electron / positron spectrum .",
