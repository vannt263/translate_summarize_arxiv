    "\\(i ) if r = 0 then eq . 1 is the free energy for two bands without pairing transfer ( josephson coupling ) between them .",
    "the quartic term which mixes the two order parameters reflects the fact that although the two bands are different , there is a constraint coming from the common chemical potential which connects them in equilibrium .",
    "it is also the realization and a measure of the strength of the interband interaction of quasiparticles and it affects the critical temperatures .",
    "the absence of a bilinear in the two order parameters term facilitates the observation of the leggett s mode in the josephson tunneling between a two - band superconductor and an ordinary superconductor @xcite .",
    "the onset of the superconducting state in one band does not imply the onset in the other . to investigate this possibility in mgb@xmath8 an experiment which checks the splitting of the transitions due to the lattice deformation by the strain fields can be decisive . in the mgb@xmath0 the compression due to pressure",
    "is anisotropic@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the compressibility along the @xmath19-axis is almost twice larger that of the plane compressibility",
    ". therefore application of uniaxial pressure on single crystals will affect differently the two gaps and the result will be a splitting of the critical temperatures , even if at ambient pressure they appear to be the same .",
    "this can be measured through a specific heat experiment under pressure . following ozaki s formulation @xcite",
    ", we add to the gl functional eq.(1 ) the term which couples the order parameters , in second order , with the strain tensor @xmath20 to first order .",

    "the effect of the pressure on these two order parameters , each one belonging to an one - dimensional representation is to shift the critical temperatures .",
    "the new critical temperatures can be found , by solving the coupled equations for @xmath25 and then setting the coefficients of @xmath25 to zero .",
    "the result is : @xmath26 , where for uniaxial pressure @xmath27 . in order to detect the splitting , the pressure must be above a certain value @xmath28 which depends on the resolution of the experiment , so that the difference in the two critical temperatures @xmath29 is experimentally detectable",
    ".    \\(ii ) if r @xmath30 0 then the pair transfering term is present and it means that the onset of superconductivity in one band implies automatically the appearance of superconductivity in the other .",
    "there is a single observed t@xmath31 with a different pressure dependence . analyzing the equations which result from the minimization of the gl free energy we get in the regime @xmath32 : @xmath33 this gives the pressure dependence of the @xmath34 : @xmath35 +   \\frac{1}{2 }   \\left[(t_{c\\sigma}^0 - t_{c\\pi}^0 + ( \\eta_{\\pi } - \\eta_{\\sigma})p)^2 +   a^2\\right]^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath36 .",
    "deviations from a straight line at moderate values of pressure can be attributed to the two bands .    _ case ii :",
    "only the @xmath12- bands superconduct . _ in this case",
    "there is one order parameter initially and the gl free energy functional is the usual one .",
    "the dominant physical situation is an important change in the electronic properties of the material under pressure , because the band ( @xmath37 ) which is below the fermi level at ambient pressure @xcite can , partially , overcome the barrier and get above the fermi level at a certain value of pressure ( crossover pressure ) , restoring the degeneracy of the two @xmath12 bands at point @xmath14 .",
    "then there will be a crossover from a superconducting state @xmath38 to a state @xmath39 . to understand this effect we need to write the gl free energy taking into account the second order parameter of the same symmetry as well as the hexagonal symmetry of the boron layers .",
    "the irreducible representation of the @xmath40 group are four one - dimensional ones ( three of them have line nodes ) and two two - dimensional ones @xcite .",
    "there are experimental data compatible with _ s_-wave or an anisotropic @xmath41-wave order parameter . and a penetration depth experiment @xcite which suggests nodes or anisotropic @xmath41-wave .",
    "therefore we consider the gap to be a function of @xmath42 and @xmath43 with a smooth modulation in the @xmath44 direction as in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a consequence",
    "the most promising candidates for the initial order parameter are the basis functions of the @xmath45 representation of the @xmath40 group .",
    "to construct the functional of the free energy for two order parameters , we need to take into account the decomposition of the terms containing the derivatives @xmath46 , which belong to the @xmath47 representation .",
    "then the decomposition @xmath48 contains the @xmath45 representation once and suggests that there is precisely one term quadratic in @xmath49 which mixes the two order parameters ( to first order each ) .",
    "there is also a quadratic term which mixes the two components , according to the trivial decomposition @xmath50 and a quartic term as well . taking into accounts all the usual terms ,",
    "we obtain the following expression for the free energy : @xmath51 we have used the fact that the @xmath52-term favors the coupling of linear combination of the two order parameters with phase difference 0 or @xmath13 between them @xcite , therefore a term @xmath53 is incorporated into the @xmath54-term of the free energy .",
    "the resemblence between eq.(1 ) and eq.(7 ) is apparent ; in the first case the mixing terms are a consequence of the interactions between the two bands , in the second case it is due to the modification of the existing gap in the electronic spectrum .    with the present approach we are in the position to describe the crossover and to consider the possibility of different effective masses and parameters ( the inclusion of the effect at @xmath55 ) .",
    "the effect of pressure can be taken into account as usual @xcite with the modification due to the particular physical situation by writing @xmath56 , @xmath57 . the additional term which couples the order parameter with the strain tensor @xmath20 , in the regime where @xmath58 is : @xmath59 \\times     parameters in the same way .",
    "the approximate value of the crossover pressure can be estimated as follows .",
    "the energy difference between the two subbands is approximated by @xmath60 , where the fraction of superconducting electrons is @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ the carrier density per boron atom in mg@xmath62 .",
    "the approximate value of the crossover pressure @xmath63 which suppresses the deformation potential @xmath64can be estimated by the expression @xmath65 where @xmath66@xmath67 is a unit cell volume of mg@xmath62 and @xmath68 is the deformation potential for a boron displacement @xmath69  @xcite . using these parameters , we get a crossover pressure of @xmath70 .",
    "this estimation shows , that an applied pressure at a realistic value influences drastically the electronic structure , producing the degeneracy of two bands which are initially splitted .",
    "superconductivity in the second band will occur at lower values of the estimated @xmath55 .",
    "the requested band overlapping around the fermi energy will also occur at lower values due to the corrugation of the fermi surfaces and the already existing strains in the material and the anisotropic compressibility .",
    "these considerations make the above estimation an upper limit of @xmath55 .",
    "the degree to which shear stresses of the sample and the surrounding fluid under pressure affect the data of pressure measurements is still under investigation @xcite .",
    "the physics of this crossover is similar in spirit to an electronic topological transition of 5/2 kind @xcite . in fig.1 in a model calculation , we illustrate the expected behavior of t@xmath31 and the form of the order parameter as a function of pressure at fixed temperature and schematically the kink at p@xmath31 of t@xmath31 . the anomaly close to @xmath55 can be detected directly in a penetration depth experiment under pressure .",
    "the picture we provide for the second case is complimentary to the first .",
    "both cases may be realized since the effects can be detected at different values of pressures . in case i , the value of pressure necessary to see the effects is limited either by the experimental resolution or by the validity of the eq . 4 at low pressure .",
    "the specific symmetry of the order parameters is only used to produce the additional terms due to strain . in case ii there is a larger predicted value for the crossover pressure and there are more specific assumptions regarding the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "early pressure experiments @xcite demonstrated the overall decrease of @xmath34 with pressure which was attributed to the loss of holes . in two of the samples there is a linear dependence of @xmath34 on pressure and in two others a weak quadratic dependence .",
    "we stress that the samples are polycrystalline and the experiment is effectively under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "also the degree of nonstoichiometry was not known .",
    "the almost linear dependence for a wide range of pressures , makes the gl functional as presented , valid for the mgb@xmath8 .",
    "experiments on single crystals will be able to verify the effects which are described .",
    "we do not attempt at the moment any fitting of experimental data because there is no experimental consensus on the different values of key parameters of the theory ( e.g. there is a wide range of published data on the value of @xmath71 @xcite ) .",
    "the presented microscopic model of superconductivity in mgb@xmath72 , is based on the correlated @xmath1- and the non - correlated @xmath2-band . the negatively charged boron layers and the positively charged magnesium layers provide a lowering of the @xmath2-band with respect to the @xmath3-band which was also noticed first in band calculations @xcite .",

    "the quasi-2d @xmath1-electrons are more localized than the 3d @xmath2-electrons .",
