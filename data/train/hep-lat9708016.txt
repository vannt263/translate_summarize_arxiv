    "since the continuum limit of a lattice gauge theory is governed by its 2-loop @xmath4-function , one expects the physics of confinement and deconfinement for pure @xmath1 gauge theory to be identical to that of pure @xmath0 gauge theory . on the other hand , @xmath0 does not have the @xmath5 center symmetry whose spontaneous breakdown in the case of the @xmath1 theory indicates its deconfinement transition .",
    "this makes the investigation of the phase diagram of the @xmath0 gauge theory especially interesting and important .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the deconfinement transition for the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory may show up as a cross over which sharpens in the continuum limit to give an ising - like second order phase transition .",
    "another reason for investigating the finite temperature transition in @xmath0 gauge theory is that it is supposed@xcite to have a bulk phase transition and may thus provide a test case for studying the interplay between these different types of phase transitions .",
    "recently , simulations of the bhanot - creutz action for su(2 ) gauge theory@xcite , @xmath6 at finite temperature revealed@xcite that the known deconfinement transition point in usual wilson action becomes a line in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane and joins the bulk transition line seen in @xcite . the order of the deconfinement transition",
    "was also seen to change from second to first for @xmath9 .",
    "the studies in @xcite were all done for a relatively small @xmath8 , i.e. , close to the wilson action .",
    "@xmath0 gauge theory provides an example far away from it .",
    "a study of finite temperature so(3 ) gauge theory was carried out in @xcite and a deconfining transition for this theory was found .",
    "however , there was some ambiguity about the nature of the high temperature phase and the order of the phase transition in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to clarify these ambiguities .",
    "the wilson action for so(3 ) gauge theory is @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the directed product of the link variables , @xmath12 , around an elementary plaquette p. the action ( [ bha ] ) for @xmath13=0 also corresponds to an @xmath0 gauge theory which was found in @xcite to have a first order bulk transition at @xmath14 .",
    "a third action we used is the halliday - schwimmer action @xcite @xmath15 here the link variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 . besides the integration over the link variables , the partition function in this case also contains a summation over all possible values of @xmath18 .",
    "it too shows @xcite a first order bulk phase transition at @xmath19 .",
    "the chief advantage of this action is that both the link variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be updated using heat - bath algorithms .",
    "we studied the adjoint plaquette @xmath22 , defined as the average of @xmath23 [ @xmath24 over all plaquettes for actions ( [ bha ] ) and ( [ adj ] ) [ action ( [ hal ] ) ] .",
    "we also measured @xmath25 , which is the average over all spatial sites of the adjoint polyakov loop , defined by @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath25 is not an order parameter .",
    "since @xmath25 can be thought of as a measure of the free energy of an adjoint quark which can be screened by gluons created from the vacuum , it is not constrained to be zero in the confined phase .",
    "similarly an adjoint wilson loop is not supposed to show area law in the confining phase . however , creation of gluon pairs from vacuum costs a considerable amount of energy as glueballs are heavy",
    ". it may therefore be favourable for adjoint quarks also to have a string between them , at least when they are not too far separated . using the action ( [ bha ] ) for @xmath27 on a @xmath28 lattice , ref .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath25 was consistent with zero till @xmath14 , after which it became nonzero , indicating a deconfinement transition around this value of @xmath8 .",
    "an unexpected and curious result of ref .",
    "@xcite was that after becoming nonzero in the high temperature phase , @xmath25 settles into either a positive value ( @xmath29 as @xmath30 ) , or a negative value ( @xmath31 as @xmath30 ) , the two states being degenerate in free energy . in @xcite",
    "the negative @xmath25 state was interpreted as the manifestation of another zero temperature confined phase .",
    "we have carried out a number of tests in order to understand the nature of the negative @xmath25 state .",
    "first , it was checked that the appearance of this phase is not due to any algorithmic problem by observing that it appears for all the three actions discussed above .",
    "we then checked that the value of @xmath25 is quite stable against changes in spatial lattice sizes from @xmath32 to @xmath33 lattices .",
    "next , we introduced a polarising ` magnetic field ' by adding a term @xmath34 to the action .",
    "as shown in the upper half of fig .",
    "1 , the average plaquette p on a @xmath28 lattice is not affected strongly by this term either below the transition ( @xmath35 ) or above the transition ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , @xmath25 is .",
    "irrespective of the start , it converges to a unique value whose sign is determined by that of @xmath37 .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath1 case and suggests strongly that the high temperature phase of the @xmath0 gauge theory also manifests itself in two ways corresponding to positive and negative @xmath25 .",
    "also note in fig .",
    "1 that the extrapolation of @xmath25 to vanishing @xmath37 yields a value consistent with zero below the phase transition .    a further test of whether the physics of these two phases is the same is the equality of the correlation lengths in these phases . we measured the correlation function , defined by @xmath38 on an @xmath39 lattice for @xmath40 and for the positive and negative @xmath25 states at @xmath41 and 3.5 .",
    "it was found that i ) at @xmath35 , which is below the transition , the correlator vanishes rapidly with @xmath42 , ii ) it approaches a constant above the phase transition and iii ) the constant is bigger for larger @xmath8 and bigger in the positive @xmath25-phase for the same @xmath8 .",
    "the mass gap , obtained from the connected parts of the correlator above or from their zero momentum projected versions , was similar for _ both _ the positive and negative @xmath25 states corresponding to both @xmath41 and 3.5 , as expected for states with same physics .",
    "it is , however , considerably different for @xmath40 .",
    "in simulations on @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath39 lattices with the actions ( [ bha ] ) and ( [ hal ] ) , long metastable states were observed on all lattices near the transition region , signaling a possible first order transition .",
    "@xmath25 was seen to tunnel between all the three states , two of which correspond to the same value of the action .",
    "runs on smaller lattices show more tunnellings and larger fluctuations in the positive @xmath2-phase .",
    "the estimated transition points for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath39 lattices are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath46 respectively .    fig .",
    "2 displays distributions of @xmath2 from the runs made at the critical couplings but from different starts .",
    "we performed about 100k-400k heat - bath sweeps depending on the size of the lattice .",
    "while the frequent tunnelling smoothens the peak structure for the @xmath43 lattice considerably , a clear three - peak structure is seen for both the @xmath44 and the @xmath39 lattices .",
    "the stability of these peaks under changes in spatial volume suggests the phase transition to be of first order .",
    "the estimates of the discontinuities in the plaquette , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "it is also interesting to note that i ) the peak for the confined phase is almost precisely at zero and ii ) normalising by the maximum allowed @xmath25 in each phase , the discontinuties for both the positive and negative phases are equal , being @xmath52 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "we also studied the theory on @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 lattices .",
    "on all these lattices , only one transition point was found , where both the plaquette and @xmath25 show a discontinuity .",
    "a clear shift in @xmath57 was found in going from @xmath58 to @xmath3 but no perceptible change in @xmath57 was found in going from @xmath3 to 6 and 8 for both actions ( [ bha ] ) and ( [ hal ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the su(2 ) case , and is also unexpected for a deconfinement transition .",
    "our simulations with a variety of actions showed the negative @xmath25-state to be present for all of them .",
    "however , using a ` magnetic field ' term to polarise , we found a unique @xmath25 state depending on the sign of the field .",
    "the correlation function measurements in both the phases of positive and negative @xmath25 indicated that the two states are physically identical high temperature deconfined phases of so(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "although a shift in @xmath59 was observed in changing @xmath60 from to 2 to 4 , no further shift was seen for @xmath60 = 6 and 8 which is characteristic of a bulk phase transition .    9 a.v .",
