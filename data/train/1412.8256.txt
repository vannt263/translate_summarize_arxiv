    "* ) , or blue shifted absorption lines in the uv or x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are typically interpreted as signs of outflowing gas .",
    "outflows can be driven in principle magnetically , thermally , and through radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the large kinetic energy and angular momentum transport outwards , outflows have strong influences on the agn environment . as a consequence ,",

    "the class of agn that shows the strongest outflows as defined by largest absorption column density and outflow velocity ( besides jets ) are broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which can reach outflow velocities of more than 20000 km s@xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "roughly 10 - 20% of optically - selected quasars belong to this class ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with even higher percentage among infrared selected samples . however , it has also been suggested that the occurrence of bals may mark a specific time in the life of a quasar @xcite .",
    "because the strength of radiation driven outflow directly depends on @xmath0 , we infer that bal qsos have extreme values for @xmath0(e.g .",
    "* ) .    in the local universe",
    "the agn with the highest @xmath0  are narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are historically defined as seyfert 1s with a fwhm(h@xmath82000 km s@xmath7 and [ oiii]/h@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although this is a rather crude definition ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the purpose of our study we adopt this definition throughout the paper . nls1s",
    "have drawn a lot of attention over the last two decades due to their extreme properties , such as , on average , steep x - ray spectra , strong fe ii emission and weak emission from the narrow line region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these properties are linked , and are most likely driven primarily by the mass of the central black hole and the eddington ratio @xmath0 . generally speaking ,",
    "nls1s are agn with low black hole masses and high @xmath0 .",
    "nls1s have also been considered to be agn in an early stage of their evolution @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite that bal qsos and nls1s are similar with respect to their high @xmath0 .",
    "it has also been found that the rest - frame optical spectra of at least some bal qsos look very much like low - redshift nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , bal qsos and nls1s have very similar feii / h@xmath1 and [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios and follow the classical @xcite eigenvector 1 relation .",
    "this is remarkable , because bal qsos and nls1s differ in their black hole masses and appear to be at opposite ends of the @xmath10 spectrum .",
    "typically seyfert 1s with large black hole masses have larger [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and smaller feii / h@xmath1 ratios than nls1s ( or bal qsos ) as shown for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although there seem to be many similarities between nls1s and bla qsos , as pointed out by @xcite , the strengths of the broad absorption lines ( bals ) seem to be directly correlated with the luminosity of the agn and bals appear only in highly - luminous agn .",
    "so far only one object has been established that shows a clear connection between nls1s and bal qso : the x - ray transient nls1 wpvs 007 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this nls1s was discovered as a bright x - ray agn during the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but showed a dramatic drop in its x - ray flux when observed a few years later @xcite .",
    "various follow - up observations by rosat , chandra , xmm and _ swift _  all confirmed this x - ray low state ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of wpvs 007 can be modeled by a power law with a strong partial covering absorber in the line of sight @xcite .",
    "uv spectroscopy by fuse and hst revealed that strong board absorption line features had evolved within just a decade ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , and cooper et al . 2014 , in prep ) .",
    "another nls1 suggested to be a link between nls1s and bal qsos is mkn 335 which was discovered by _ swift _  in may 2007 to be in a deep x - ray flux state @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , mkn 335 has also developed uv absorption lines as reported by @xcite .",
    "this new finding may suggest that mkn 335 will develop similar uv absorption lines as wpvs 007 did over the last two decades .",

    "four of the 11 bal qsos appear to be clearly x - ray weak following the definition by @xcite with @xmath21@xmath272.0 .",

    "although for bal qsos absorption is the first thought when a source is detected to be x - ray weak ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectral analysis of the data for these four source does not suggest the presence of a strong absorber .",
    "interestingly , the bal qsos in which an intrinsic absorber is clearly detected appear not to be x - ray weak .",
    "alternatively , these sources could be heavily absorbed ( i.e. compton thick ) , and only a reflected fraction of the intrinsic emission is actually seen . also , given the quality of the spectral data , a partial covering geometry can not be excluded . in a partial covering absorber scenario only a fraction of the intrinsic continuum emission is seen directly , while the rest is strongly obscured .",
    "also note again , that some of the bal qsos , like pg 1004 + 130 and pg 1700 + 518 may be intrinsically x - ray weak @xcite .",
    "if bal qsos and nls1s represent related phenomena , then some of their characteristic intrinsic properties should be similar . for our study",

    "the mean , standard distribution , and median of these distributions are summarized in table[agn_statistics ] .",
    "while the uv spectral indices of nls1s and bal qsos are very similar , bal qsos show significantly flatter x - ray spectral slopes @xmath22 , and steeper optical to x - ray spectral slopes @xmath21  than nls1s .",
    "there are several ways to interpret these properties .",
    "the flatter x - ray slopes in bal qsos may be a consequence of their slightly lower eddington ratios than nls1s , as suggested by the relations found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they may also imply stronger ( cold or ionized ) absorption , which was not yet detectable in available x - ray spectra due to short exposure times .",
    "the steeper @xmath21  can be primarily explained by stronger absorption in x - rays in bal qsos , for example by a partial covering absorber ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , bal qsos exhibit much larger @xmath29@xmath21  parameters than nls1s .    as for the emission line properties , we noticed that the fwhm([oiii ] ) of bal qsos are significantly larger than those of nls1s .",
    "note , that these broad nlr emission lines are consistent with bal qsos being hosted in significantly larger galaxies .",
    "as we will see later , these [ oiii ] line widths are consistent with the black hole masses measured in bal qsos .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 flux ratios in bal qsos are significantly lower than compared with nls1s",
    ". the feii / h@xmath1 ratios of bal qsos are larger than those found in nls1s .",
    "this follows the eigenvector 1 relation found by @xcite in which agn with stronger feii emission show weaker emission from the nlr . compared with the bal qso sample of @xcite , the bal qsos in our sample here appear quite extreme in their [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and feii / h@xmath1 line ratios as listed in table[agn_statistics ] .",
    "the bal qsos in @xcite showed mean , standard deviations and medians of 0.63 , 0.29 , and 0.65 , and 0.12 , 0.42 , and 0.20 for log [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and log feii / h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to those found for nls1s ( see table[agn_statistics ] ) .",
    "note however , that the bal qsos in our sample for which optical line ratios could be determined are all at lower redshift , which the bal qsos in the @xcite sample are all at redshifts around z=2 .",
    "bal qsos have significantly larger black hole masses than nls1s . in general ,",
    "the black hole masses of bal qsos are about 100 times larger than those of nls1s .",
    "what is somewhat surprising is that the eddington ratios @xmath0  of bal qsos are about a factor of 10 lower than we found in the nls1s in our bright soft x - ray selected agn sample .",
    "figure 7 in @xcite , however , suggested that the eddington ratios of nls1s and bal qsos are about unity .",
    "figure 7 in @xcite also suggests that the mass accretion rates @xmath2 of bal qsos and nls1s are significantly different . as displayed in figure[plots_distr ] also when compare our bal qso and nls1 samples we come to a similar conclusion .",
    "we estimated the mass accretion rate from the bolometric luminosity with @xmath30 assuming a mass to radiation efficiency of @xmath31=0.1 .",
    "also in our sample , bal qsos have larger mass accretion rates than nls1s .",
    "note that some of these mass accretion rates in bal qsos exceed 100 @xmath3/year .",
    "figure[plots_lledd_mdot ] displays the relation between the eddington ratio @xmath0  and the mass accretion rate @xmath2 following figure 7 in @xcite . in figure[plots_lledd_mdot ]",
    "the bal qsos of the chandra sample are displayed as magenta stars , nls1s as solid blue triangles , bls1s as solid red circles , and the bal qsos of @xcite are shown as turquoise crosses .",
    "clearly , bal qsos and nls1s fall on two separated groups . for a given @xmath0 , bal qsos",
    "have a significantly larger mass accretion rate than nls1s .",
    "this is not completely surprising given the fact that the black hole masses of nls1s is about a factor of 100 lower than that of bal qsos ( see also the distributions of black hole masses in figure[plots_distr ] ) .",
    "however , the plot also shows that the schematic plot shown in figure 7 in @xcite is too simple .",
    "although generally speaking , bal qsos have higher mass accretion rates than nls1s , as already shown in figure[plots_distr ] , there is some overlap between the two groups and the separation between the two classes of agn is not as strong as suggested in figure 7 in @xcite .",
    "the other difference is that the bal qsos in our sample appear to have lower @xmath0  than in the @xcite sample .",
    "the lower @xmath0  found in our bal qso sample is similar to those found in the bal qsos in @xcite .      in order to better understand the relations among the observed parameters we applied a principal component analysis ( pca ;",
    "to the sample of 119 agn , including the swift agn sample plus the 7 low - redshift bal qsos listed in table[chandra_log ] .",
    "a pca is a standard data mining tool that allows to reduce the number of properties that describe a sample of sources from many to a few . in a mathematical sense , the pca searches for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a correlation coefficient matrix .",
    "a good description for the application of a pca in astronomy can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for our sample we used @xmath22 , @xmath32 , @xmath21 , @xmath29@xmath21 , fwhm(h@xmath1 ) , fwhm([oiii ] ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath1 , feii / h@xmath1 as input parameters in the pca .",
    "the results of the pca are summarized in table[pca_results ] .",
    "this pca is somewhat similar to the one that we applied to basically the same agn sample in @xcite , although with slightly different input parameters .",
    "figure[pca_corr ] displays the correlations between eigenvector 1 and @xmath0 , and eigenvector 2 and the black hole mass and @xmath2 .",
    "while the eigenvector 1 of our sample can be associated with the eddington ratio @xmath0  ( left panel ) , such as in the pca performed by @xcite , the eigenvector 2 of our sample is clearly dominated by the black hole mass ( middle panel ) .",
    "the spearman rank order correlation coefficients , student s t - test values , and probabilities of a random result of the eigenvector 1 - @xmath0  and eigenvector 2 - @xmath10 correlations are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "although the mass accretion rate is anti - correlated with eigenvector 2 ( right panel ) with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , it is in our sample also anti - correlated with eigenvector 1 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 however , eigenvectors are orthogonal , which means they should not show a correlation among them .",
    "therefore we conclude that in our sample eigenvector 2 represents the black hole mass and not @xmath2 .",
    "note , that for his input sources and input parameters , @xcite concluded from his pca that eigenvector 2 represents the mass accretion rate @xmath2 . as a test we performed a pca with just the optical line properties ( fwhm(h@xmath1 ) , fwhm([oiii ] ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath1 , and feii / h@xmath1 ) .",
    "in this case the correlation between eigenvector 2 and @xmath2 becomes more significant with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "however , the correlation between eigenvector 2 and the black hole mass is still stronger than that with @xmath2 .",
    "the main motivation behind this study is the question of whether bal qsos and nls1s are intrinsically similar but only appear at different ends of the black hole mass distribution spectrum as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although we see similarities between our sample and that of @xcite , in particular that nls1s and bla qsos have similar feii / h@xmath1 and [ oiii]/h@xmath1 line ratios we also notice differences in the studies .      while our sample size is significantly larger than the initial exploratory study of @xcite , it is still subject to selection effects , and we therefore first address the key question , if and how our sample selection affects the parameters we wish to compare among nls1s and bal - qsos :    1 .   * redshift distributions : * traditionally , bal qsos have been discovered at redshifts of about z=2 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this leads to selecting highly - luminous and therefore high black hole mass agn . on the other hand ,",
    "our agn sample consists of bright x - ray selected agn which appear at much lower redshifts with z@xmath470.4 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the 7 low redshift bal qsos presented in this paper have redshifts that are between z=0.04 and z=0.47 and fall into the redshift range of our agn sample .",
    "this redshift range is also comparable to the pg sample by @xcite which contains the bal qsos used in @xcite sample .",

    "therefore the soft x - ray selection favors sources with high l / ledd among the class of nls1 galaxies as a whole and the eddington ratios found in our agn sample may appear larger than in an optically selected nls1 sample .",
    "the soft x - ray selection also misses highly absorbed agn , such as typically bal qsos .",
    "although we have to keep these selection effects in mind , they do not make our study invalid . on the contrary",
    ", our comparison is between bal qsos and nls1s , and the latter are usually found among soft x - ray selected agn . it has also been shown that in bal qsos and in nls1s absorbers can develop over time and the absorption column density and covering fraction can vary in x - rays as well as in the uv . for nls1s a good example here is wpvs 007 which has developed strong bals within a decade @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , more and more evidence has been found that also the bals in bal qsos can be highly variable ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * e.g. ) .",
    "while figure 7 in @xcite suggests that nls1s and bal qsos are both at high @xmath0 where bal qsos have significantly larger mass accretion rates than nls1s , we found from our sample that this picture is more complicated : although also in our sample bal qsos appear to show the highest mass accretion rates , some appear to be significantly lower , even down to 0.1 @xmath3/year in the case of pg 1004 + 130 . compared with the bal qsos in @xcite , where the mean mass accretion rate was of the order of about 35 @xmath3/year",
    ", the mass accretion rates in the sample presented here appear to be rather modest with a median of about 4 @xmath3/year",
    ". however , some of the mass accretion rates of the bal qsos in our sample are extreme , exceeding 100 @xmath3/year .",
    "the distribution of the mass accretion rates in bal qsos spans over three orders of magnitude as shown in figure[plots_distr ] .",
    "although the mass accretion rate of nls1s also stretches over three orders of magnitude , the lowest values of the mass accretion rate are of the order of 10@xmath48 solar masses and the highest of the order of a few solar masses per year .",
    "there is a some overlap between nls1s and bal qsos in mass accretion rate in our sample .",
    "the two samples are not as separated as the bal qso and nls1s samples of @xcite .",
    "this maybe in part a selection effect , because the nls1s is our sample are soft x - ray selected which are primarily sources with high @xmath0 .",
    "if we just focus on the 7 low - redshift bal qsos in our study ( see table[chandra_log ] ) we notice that the mass accretion rates of these bal qsos are in the range between 0.1 to 8 @xmath3/year and are somewhat comparable to the mass accretion rates seen in nls1s . the bal qsos which really make a difference are those at higher redshifts .",
    "we noticed that the mass accretion rates in bal qsos is rather high with more than 100 @xmath49 yr@xmath7 , and 35 in the bal qso sample by @xcite .",
    "one reason why these accretion rates appear so high might be our assumption of the mass to radiation efficiency which we for simplicity just set to @xmath50 .",
    "if however the black hole spin in bal qsos is significantly higher this would increase the efficiency and reduce the mass accretion rate necessary to explain the observed bolometric luminosity .",
    "for example , if the black hole in a bal qso is maximal spinning ( a=0.998 ) the efficiency will be @xmath51 , or three times higher than our assumed @xmath31=0.1 . this would imply that the mass accretion rate is a factor of 3 lower , which is much easier to explain than the high mass accretion rates we estimated at first .",
    "in contrast to bal qsos , in nls1s the efficiency may be lower and the mass accretion rate higher if the black hole is rotating slower than in our assumption .",
    "keep in mind that for an efficiency of @xmath50 the black hole is spinning already with a=0.6 .",
    "one argument that the black hole spins in bal qsos and nls1s are systematically different , is the finding that the black hole masses in bal qsos are significantly larger than in nls1s .",
    "a larger black hole mass also means that the accreted matter has transferred a larger amount of angular momentum to this black hole which then results in a larger spin ( in a scenario where smbhs primarily grow by accretion ) .",
    "one more argument for a higher efficiency of the mass to radiation conversion due to a relativistically spinning black hole is that the mass accretion rates in the sample presented here appear to be relatively low compared with those of the bal qso sample by @xcite .",
    "the bal qsos in our sample also have eddington ratios @xmath0  which are lower than those of nls1s . in figure 7 in @xcite",
    "shows that the bal qsos in the @xcite sample are all at @xmath0=1 , which is typical for nls1s .",
    "although our agn / nls1 sample is soft x - ray selected and has therefore a bias towards high @xmath0  agn , the eddington ratios found in our sample agree well with those of the nls1s in the optically selected sample by @xcite . however , a comparison between our sample and that of @xcite appears somewhat difficult because @xcite do not list the values of @xmath0  and @xmath2 of the nls1s and bal qsos of their pg quasar sample .",
    "although the eigenvector 1 in our pca can also be associated with the eddington ratio @xmath0  as in the @xcite sample , our eigenvector 2 seems to be different .",
    "while @xcite suggested that the eigenvector 2 in his sample is clearly associated with the mass accretion rate @xmath2 , in our sample eigenvector 2 is more strongly correlated with the black hole mass .",
    "these differences are not surprising .",
    "a pca is a purely mathematical tool and the results depend strongly on the set of input parameters as well as the objects in the sample . while in our pca we used continuum properties and line widths and ratios , the pca in @xcite primarily used optical line properties .",
    "therefore it can be expected that the results of the pcas could be different . however , when we only use optical line parameters in a pca , we still find that in our sample that eigenvector 2 is strongly correlated with the black hole mass .      from our bal qso and nls1 samples we found that bal qsos have black hole masses more than 100 times larger than those seen in a typical nls1 .",
    "at first glance this seems to be a selection effect because most bal qsos appear at higher redshifts which leads to selecting objects with higher luminosities and larger back hole masses .",
    "however , for low - redshift bal qsos in our _ chandra _  sample , we note that even these objects have black hole masses of the order of @xmath52@xmath3 , significantly larger than those found in nls1s ( see figure[plots_distr ] ) .",
    "in contrast to nls1s , bal qsos may have already fully developed black holes with regards to their host galaxy masses .",
    "this argument is supported by the m - @xmath4 relation which relates the mass of the central black hole to that of the host galaxy .",
    "bal qsos fall right on the @xcite m - @xmath4 relation as shown in in figure[plots_m_sigma ] ( the @xcite relation is shown as a black solid line ) , while nls1s typically fall below this relation @xcite .",
    "we adopted the method introduced by @xcite who suggested to use the [ oiii ] line as a proxy of the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy bulge}$ ] for the stellar velocity dispersion determined from the width of the [ oiii]@xmath53 line . ] .",
    "because the narrow line region is in the gravitational potential of the host galaxy bulge , the nlr gas follows the same velocity dispersion as the bulge stars . as a comparison",
    "we also show the bal qsos from the study by @xcite in this plot .",
    "note that the bal qso of the @xcite sample have redshifts between z=1 - 2 and from our bal qso sample we have only [ oiii ] and h@xmath1 measurements of the 7 low - redshift bal qsos .",
    "the bal qsos of our sample which are at higher redshifts also have similar black hole masses as the objects in the @xcite bal qso sample .",
    "whether nls1 galaxies , as a group , fall on or below the @xmath54}$ ] relation is an important question ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the only bal qso that falls below the m - @xmath55}$ ] relation is pg 1001 + 054 .",
    "the ( soft x - ray selected ) nls1 sample of @xcite was located significantly below the @xmath54}$ ] relation , while the nls1 sample of @xcite was consistent with the @xmath54}$ ] relation of non - active galaxies , with the exception of sources at high @xmath0 .",
    "these had their whole [ oiii ] emission systematically blueshifted ( `` blue outliers '' ) , implying large outflows which come with a strong extra line broadening apparently displacing them from the @xmath54}$ ] relation .",
    "therefore the fwhm([oiii ] ) measured in these objects may not represent the velocity of the velocity dispersion in the bulge , but has an additional , unknown contribution by outflows . in the same way as turbulent motion can lead to an overestimation of the the black hole masses from blr emission line widths as shown by @xcite , an outflow adds an additional velocity component to the total velocity and therefore leads to an overestimation of the mass of the host galaxy bulge .",
    "the main question remaining is why do we see strong outflows which appear as deep uv absorption troughs in bal qsos but these are rarely seen in nls1s . in a matter of fact , the only nls1s that has shown dramatic uv absorption roughs is wpvs 007 .",
    "part of the answer maybe that bal qsos are highly - luminous agn and as shown by @xcite , the strengths of the bal troughs correlates with luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , the nls1 wpvs 007 is a low luminosity agn and seems to contradict these findings .",
    "strong outflows are typically associated with high @xmath0  which results in a strong radiation field from the accretion disk producing radiation driven winds / outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , nls1s with high @xmath0  exhibit strong outflows through their broad , blueshifted [ oiii ] emission lines ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we do not see in bal qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one reason for the slight differences between our study and that by @xcite maybe the different sample sizes . while in our sample we have 11 bal qsos ( 7 at low redshift ) and 53 nls1s , the numbers in the @xcite sample are 4 bal qsos and 8 nls1s",
    ". the low number of in particular bal qsos may have a large influence on these differences . as mentioned about",
    ", the mass accretion rates in other bal qso samples , like that in @xcite appear to be larger .",
    "therefore in a sample of just 4 sources , the chance of selecting bal qsos with larger mass accretion rates is quite high .    to conclude , we confirm the results by @xcite and @xcite about the differences in the black hole mass distributions between bal qsos and nls1s .",
    "we also confirm that the eddington ratios of bal qsos and nls1s are at the higher end of the @xmath0  distribution of agn in general .",
    "however , from our samples of nls1s and bal qsos the eddington ratios nls1s typically operate around unity , while those of the bal qsos are slightly lower . nls1s and",
    "bal qso also share that their feii / h@xmath1 ratios are very high and their [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios are low - following the classic @xcite eigenvector 1 relation .",
    "although some bal qsos in our sample exhibit very high mass accretion rates inferred from their bolometric luminosities , the mass accretion rates of bal qsos and nls1s appear to be more similar than previously thought .",
    "this is in particular true when we look at the low redshift bal qsos in our sample .",
    "interestingly , even though bal qsos have relatively large @xmath0  ratios , they fall right onto the @xmath56}$ ] relation suggesting that they have fully developed black holes .",
    "one reason for the large bolometric luminosities found in bal qsos may be that the black hole is spinning relativistically which leads to a significantly higher efficiency of the mass to radiation conversion . in the future we need to increase the number of bal qsos in our study to obtain better statistics on the relations found in our study . in particular we need to obtain more x - ray observations of bal qsos to measure the continuum properties . and last but not least , in the far future we need to study the fe k@xmath57 line emission line to study the gravitational and relativistic effects which can be used to measure the black hole spin .",

    "<S> we consider whether broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are similar , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we constructed a sample of 11 bal qsos from existing chandra and swift observations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that bal qsos and nls1s both operate at high eddington ratios @xmath0 , although bal qsos have slightly lower @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> bal qsos and nls1s in general have high feii / h@xmath1 and low [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios following the classic boroson & green eigenvector 1 relation . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the mass accretion rates @xmath2 of bal qsos and nls1s are more similar than previously thought , although some bal qsos exhibit extreme mass accretion rates of more than 10 @xmath3/year . </S>",
    "<S> these extreme mass accretion rates may suggest that the black holes in bal qsos are relativistically spinning . </S>",
    "<S> black hole masses in bal qsos are a factor of 100 larger than nls1s . from their location on a m-@xmath4 plot </S>",
    "<S> , we find that bal qsos contain fully developed black holes . applying a principal component analysis to our sample we find eigenvector 1 to correspond to the eddington ratio @xmath0 , and eigenvector 2 to black hole mass .    </S>"
