    "elliptic flow  @xcite  the azimuthal momentum anisotropy of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane , @xmath2  is one of the key observables for collective behavior in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the large @xmath3 observed experimentally in semi - central au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite is consistent with non - viscous hydrodynamic expansion of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) droplet  @xcite . on the other hand , a hadron `` plasma '' with small transverse pressure as initial condition underestimates @xmath3 at midrapidity  @xcite .",
    "these observations have been interpreted as an indication for the formation of a qgp with very small viscosity shortly after the instant of collision .",
    "specific solutions of partial differential equations such as hydrodynamics in general depend on the assumed boundary conditions . here , we focus on the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of the matter created in non - central au+au collisions at rhic . specifically , we consider the `` color glass condensate '' ( cgc ) initial conditions within a @xmath0-factorization approach  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath3 in the final state is proportional to the initial spatial eccentricity @xmath4 in the plane @xmath5 perpendicular to the beam axis , @xmath6 the average is taken with respect to the initial energy density distribution .",
    "the reaction plane is spanned by the beam ( @xmath7 ) and impact parameter ( @xmath1 ) directions .    ref .",
    "@xcite observed that the cgc initial conditions correspond to much larger eccentricity than the commonly assumed scaling of the initial energy density with the local number of participants .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamical simulations with such initial conditions were shown to overestimate the measured @xmath3 even if dissipative effects in the cool hadronic phase are taken into account ( by using a hadronic cascade  @xcite rather than hydrodynamics ) .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the different eccentricities obtained from the cgc and glauber model , respectively , arise from mainly the low - density edges of the overlap region where the cgc approach is less trustworthy .    in this paper",
    "we show that more sophisticated models for the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath8 than those employed in the original kln approach  @xcite and in  @xcite also predict much larger eccentricity than the glauber approach .",
    "in particular , we shall calculate @xmath4 using gluon distributions which account not only for saturation but also for extended geometric scaling ( anomalous dimension ) and leading - twist shadowing , both of which are important for transverse momenta above the saturation momentum @xmath9 .",
    "we also provide a simple qualitative explanation of the large eccentricity in the cgc approach which motivates that it does not originate from pure `` edge effects '' .",
    "we therefore expect that both the large eccentricity of the transverse overlap region as well as the in - plane `` twist '' of produced gluons  @xcite are rather generic predictions of the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "finally , using a simple model for energy loss induced by the dense medium , we show how high-@xmath10 partons could probe the initial distribution of produced gluons in coordinate space .",
    "in the @xmath0-factorization approach the number distribution of produced gluons is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 the number of colors .",
    "here , @xmath10 and @xmath13 denote the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the produced gluons , respectively .",
    "the light - cone momentum fractions of the colliding gluon ladders are then given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the center of mass energy .",
    "we set @xmath16 such that the minimal saturation scale @xmath17 in the above integration is @xmath18 gev .",
    "we note that the eccentricity _ at midrapidity _ is rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the kln approach  @xcite employs the following unintegrated gluon distribution function at @xmath19 : @xmath20 @xmath9 denotes the saturation momentum at the given momentum fraction @xmath1 and transverse position @xmath21 .",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath22 is determined by the multiplicity at midrapidity for the most central collisions . in the kln approach , the saturation scale for a nucleus in @xmath23 collisions",
    "is then parameterized as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the transverse density of participants .",
    "it is calculated from the thickness functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 is the impact parameter vector in the transverse plane . the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section at @xmath30  gev is @xmath31  mb .",
    "the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 is motivated by deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data from the hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) for @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the parameterization  ( [ eq : qs ] ) leads to an average saturation momentum at midrapidity of about 1.5  gev for central au+au collisions at @xmath30  gev , which is in line with standard estimates  @xcite .",
    "the kln model  ( [ eq : uninteg ] ) exhibits a transition from saturation , @xmath35 , directly to the dglap regime @xmath36 at @xmath37 ; it does not incorporate leading - twist shadowing since @xmath38 is proportional to the density of participants at a given transverse coordinate . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that dis data from hera exhibit approximate `` geometric scaling '' even for @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that at small @xmath1 the anomalous dimension @xmath40 of the gluon distribution function evolves smoothly towards its dglap limit of @xmath41 as @xmath42 increases .",

    "the @xmath10-integrated multiplicity is small when @xmath9 is large .",
    "since the eccentricity @xmath4 involves an integration over a wide range of saturation momenta , however , it appears less obvious whether or not the geometric scaling window above @xmath9 plays a role . here , we employ the following parameterization of @xmath47 for @xmath48  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the anomalous dimension corresponding to leading - order ( lo ) bfkl evolution with saturation boundary conditions in the saddle point approximation  @xcite .",
    "the rapidities @xmath51 of the fusing gluon ladders are related to their momentum fractions @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "the extended geometric scaling window corresponds to the region of @xmath0 where @xmath47 evolves from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "for asymptotically small @xmath1 , one can neglect the term @xmath56 in  ( [ eq : anom ] ) and the upper end of the extended geometric scaling window is then given by @xmath57  @xcite ; for the central region of rhic collisions , the approach to the dglap regime is mainly driven by the subasymptotic @xmath56 term .",
    "the above form of @xmath47 reproduces the evolution of inclusive @xmath10-distributions from minimum - bias @xmath58 collisions with rapidity rather well  @xcite .    finally , we shall also compute @xmath4 using an unintegrated gluon distribution obtained from an _ ansatz _ for the dipole forward scattering amplitude @xmath59  @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the transverse size of the dipole , conjugate to @xmath62 .",

    "the fact that all of the above models for @xmath22 predict about the same @xmath4 already indicates that the large anisotropy in coordinate space might be generic to the @xmath0-factorization formula  ( [ eq : ktfac ] ) .",

    "the number of produced gluons scales approximately with the _ smaller _ of the saturation scales of the two nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this is valid not only as a function of rapidity but also as a function of the transverse coordinate  @xcite : @xmath80 to understand this , approximate the local unintegrated gluon distribution by @xmath81 . scaling with @xmath82 follows also from analytical solutions of the classical yang - mills equations for asymmetric collisions  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : almond ] depicts two paths away from the center of the overlap region .",
    "along @xmath83 the number density scales , to logarithmic accuracy , as @xmath84 on the other hand , in the opposite direction along @xmath85 we have @xmath86 in the wounded nucleon model , the density scales with the _ total _ number of participants from both nuclei , @xmath87 which of course drops less rapidly with @xmath88 since the drop of the density towards the edge of the more dilute nucleus is at least partly compensated by the increasing number of participants from the other nucleus .    along the line @xmath89 ,",
    "in turn , both saturation scales are equal and so @xmath90 since the number density along @xmath91 drops more rapidly for the cgc initial conditions than for the glauber model , while both behave the same along @xmath92 , the resulting eccentricity is higher for the former . thus , the large eccentricity is a feature inherent to the @xmath0-factorization formula .",
    "contrary to simple geometrical overlap models , the cgc also predicts a non - trivial longitudinal structure of the initial condition . even under the simplest assumption of _ local _ quantum evolution , which implies that the @xmath21-dependence of @xmath93 arises exclusively via @xmath94 at any rapidity , moments of the density of produced gluons in coordinate space do depend on @xmath13  !",

    "hence , as compared to the geometry at @xmath105 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : almond ] , not only does the center of the `` overlap '' shift with rapidity but the entire shape changes .",
    "[ fig : x - moments ] also shows that the @xmath98 factor , which models large-@xmath1 effects , strongly affects the third moment of @xmath88 at @xmath106 .",

    "[ fig : x - moments ] can not be trusted quantitatively . )",
    "this result indicates that our present limited understanding of `` large-@xmath1 '' effects within the cgc formalism inhibits more quantitative calculations of the initial conditions for hydrodynamic models over a broad range of @xmath13  @xcite . in order to compute the observable momentum - space distributions of particles from these initial conditions",
    "one needs to solve for the subsequent thermalization and three - dimensional hydrodynamical expansion  @xcite of produced gluons , which is beyond the scope of the present note .",
    "however , high-@xmath10 particles may probe the initial density distribution via final - state interactions such as energy loss .",
    "we employ a simple model for radiative energy loss of fast partons to illustrate the qualitative effect .    in a dense qcd medium",

    "the asymmetry @xmath3 for semi - central collisions is slightly larger for cgc versus glauber initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , for the assumed non - dissipative expansion , which leads to a rather rapid cooling of the medium , the difference is moderate .",
    "we have shown that the eccentricity predicted by cgc models is larger than that from glauber models .",
    "this property is due to the different scaling behavior of the density in the transverse plane of the collision .",
    "namely , @xmath0-factorization predicts that @xmath137 is proportional to the smaller rather than to the average of the two local saturation scales .",
    "we also find that the centrality dependence of the multiplicity and of the eccentricity depend only weakly on `` details '' of the unintegrated gluon distribution function , such as leading - twist shadowing and the anomalous dimension .",
    "the centrality dependence of the saturation momentum can be tested further by high-@xmath10 particle production in p+a collisions  @xcite .",
    "these observations could be very important for our understanding of the collective expansion of the high - density matter created at rhic and , in the near future , at the lhc .",
    "larger initial eccentricity should lead to larger @xmath3 in the final state unless the build - up of azimuthally asymmetric collective flow is damped by dissipative effects .",
    "@xcite found that dissipation in the hadronic stage might not be sufficient to explain experimental data .",
    "dissipative corrections to relativistic ideal fluid expansion of a qgp have recently been discussed in refs .",
    "previous parton cascade simulations with only elastic two - body scattering concluded that a huge transport opacity ( large parton cross sections and/or large parton densities ) is needed to account for the measured @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it will be most interesting to reconsider those results using the cgc initial conditions suggested here together with parton multiplication processes  @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that a better understanding of _ large_-@xmath1",
    "effects within the cgc is important to provide quantitative results on the structure in coordinate space of the initial condition for hydrodynamic models of heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "this note has been added in compliance with a request of the referee of this paper to clarify our use of the participant density  ( [ eq : npart ] ) in the definition  ( [ eq : qs ] ) of the saturation momentum , and in the unintegrated gluon distribution function  ( [ eq : uninteg ] ) .",
    "this may raise concern as the unintegrated gluon distribution functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 then appear to be non - universal quantities which depend on properties of the collision partner .",
    "one might prefer to take @xmath140 to be proportional to the thickness function @xmath141 of the corresponding nucleus rather than to its participant density .",
    "we have found that doing so leads to a significant overestimate of the multiplicity in peripheral collisions and hence to a less good description of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndy ] than for the original kln approach  @xcite with @xmath142 .",
    "this failure can be corrected by taking into account explicitly the probabilities @xmath143 of actually encountering at least one nucleon in nucleus @xmath78 or @xmath144 , respectively , at a given transverse coordinate .",
    "this redefines the unintegrated gluon distributions as @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath146-dependence of @xmath147 can then be defined as @xmath148 , which prevents it from dropping below the saturation scale for a single nucleon at the periphery of the nuclei .",
    "factorization is now manifestly preserved and we also find that the centrality dependence of the multiplicity is very similar to that from the original kln approach , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndy ] .    with respect to the multiplicity @xmath149 , however , the approach sketched in the previous paragraph is essentially identical to that of ref .",

    "consequently , we find that the approach sketched in this note predicts an eccentricity roughly half - way inbetween the glauber and the kln approaches for the most peripheral collisions but is close to the latter for semi - central collisions where @xmath141 and @xmath157 differ very little .",
