    "a scientific connection of hypernuclear to nuclear few - body physics seems to be well established by the modern picture that @xmath0 particle plays _ a glue like role _ in hypernucleus . according to that picture @xmath0-particle acts towards the centre producing a dynamical contraction of the core nucleus .",
    "such picture opens _ per definitionem _ interesting issues of the effects of @xmath0-nucleon ( @xmath3 ) spin - orbit force as well as hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath4 ) interaction , both for the single-@xmath0 and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "this is a basic direction of research in contemporary hypernuclear physics dealing with @xmath0 and @xmath5 hyperons ( @xmath6 ) , and broadening to a higher strangeness degree of freedom by including of @xmath7 hyperons ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the crucial steps have been recently made by the japanese groups of y.  akaishi @xcite and of e.  hiyama @xcite .",
    "within _ ab initio _ variational calculations of the s - shell single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , the important role was attributed to the @xmath3-@xmath9 coupling which strongly affects an internal structure of the core nucleus @xcite . in case of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei , beyond the pauli suppression effect",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath11 coupling effect was investigated to be significant for the proper evaluation of the @xmath4 interaction @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the @xmath12 and @xmath4 interactions may be searching for within the two theoretical frameworks : meson theory ( meson exchange model ) which is based on the modern potentials of few - body physics and/or quark model .",
    "which way of answering will be conceptually more or less accepted , depends exclusively on the present and near future hypernuclear experiments . at present ,",
    "two state - of - the - art experimental techniques on @xmath0-spectroscopy seem to dominate in hypernuclear physics .",
    "the first , based on the reaction @xmath13 and neutral meson spectrometer , was developed by the e907 and e931 experiments at the bnl .",
    "in both experiments , hypernuclei were created by producing @xmath14 via the strangeness exchange reaction by using secondary beam of stopping kaons .",
    "another high resolution technique was developed at the _ jlab _ by the _",
    "hnss collaboration_. that is the electroproduction of @xmath0-hypernuclei by the @xmath15 reaction . in this paper",
    ", our attention is focussed on the first method which is , essentially , based on the nms and its detection properties and parameters .",
    "a neutral meson spectrometer ( nms ) constructed and commissioned at lampf , has been used by the collaboration experiment e907 @xcite at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) of the bnl for @xmath0-hypernuclear spectroscopy based on the reaction : @xmath16 , when a recoiling hypernucleus and a @xmath17 are produced .",
    "the e907 was particularly dedicated for the reaction : @xmath18 , in order to study s- and p - level states in the excitation spectrum of the @xmath19 hypernucleus .",
    "reaction vertex reconstruction is well determined by the @xmath17 production and its immediate electromagnetic decay ( @xmath20 ) in two photons , without loosing energy in the target at the @xmath0-production point .",
    "a high spectroscopic resolution is thoroughly defined by the kinematically complete measurement of two photons from the @xmath17 decay : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is energy sharing parameter between two photons , @xmath23 is opening angle between two photons as seen by the _ arm1 _ and _ arm2 _ of the nms , and @xmath24 is total energy of the @xmath17 to be reconstructed from the two photons .",
    "a schematic view of nms including large area veto scintillation counter , bgo conversion planes , mwpcs , and csi crystal array of each arm can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . within the frame of the e907 engineering runs off - line data analysis , we found the bgo - layers are very critical and sensitive parts in view of the overall energy resolution of the nms .",
    "1 . shows a conceptual front view of the single bgo conversion plane .",
    "it consists of 14 rods of @xmath25 cross section and 40 cm length each .",
    "the individual rod was composed from the two identical bars of 20 cm length , coupled together and viewed from the ends by photomultipliers ( _ pmts _ ) .",
    "it can be proved by the taylor s derivative expansion of the @xmath26 function that uncertainty in @xmath17 energy , arising from the bgo thickness ( @xmath27 ) and opening angle ( @xmath28 ) of the nms real set - up , should be less than 0.02 mev @xcite .",
    "hence , a top - bottom position dependence along the bgo rod length only remained to be investigated .",
    "we developed a precise method for calibration of the two conversion bgo front planes in each arms of nms , which convert photons from the @xmath17 decays into showers .",
    "gain equalization and position dependence of the output pulses ( voltage - time area , in units of _ nvs _ ) over an entire length of the each rod were calibrated by the small collimated @xmath2co source coincident method .",
    "a method was based on acquiring coincidences between top and bottom signals of the individual bgo rod , while a collimated source was located at the particular place of the five different positions ( @xmath29 , respectively ) along @xmath30 length of the crystal . a basic function used to figure out a position dependence of bgo",
    "has the form of @xmath31 .",
    "effective attenuation length @xmath32 was fitted out for each top - bottom bgo rod , which finally gave a column of 112 calibration values which correspond to four conversion planes of the nms .",
    "a mean value of @xmath33 was determined on the set of all data .",
    "variation in the intensities of the pulse comparing a position at the near edge with respect to the middle of the bgo rod was evaluated to be @xmath34 , and should be ignored assuming @xmath35 as an overall calorimeter parameter for the entire bgo plane .",
    "however , the strongest attenuation length of @xmath36 was evaluated from the measured data @xcite . for that case , a variation in the intensities was calculated to be @xmath37 , and hence to be used for correction of the nms overall energy resolution . in fig .",
    "2 . a position dependence of the individual bgo rod is shown .",
    "by the nms a reaction @xmath13 became a new tool for the high resolution @xmath0-spectroscopy .",
    "our hypothesis of position dependence of the bgo - layers has been clearly demonstrated by the small collimated @xmath2co source coincident method .",
    "a significant variations in @xmath32 of individual rods were figured out .",
    "the position sensitive parameters of the four bgo conversion planes of the nms have inevitably to be integrated in the data analysis program of the e907 .",
