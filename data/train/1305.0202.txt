    "then the mask polynomial @xmath5 contains the following kernel polynomials    case * ( i ) * : either    ( i )  @xmath708 ; or    \\(ii )  a factor of @xmath709 ,    where   @xmath710 and at least one @xmath711 with    @xmath712 and @xmath713 .",
    "case * ( ii ) * :    \\(iii )  @xmath714 .",
    "moreover , each of the above @xmath534 represents a tile digit set of @xmath34 .    * remark . * for the polynomial in @xmath539 , if @xmath715 , then @xmath716 and this means that the whole factor @xmath717 divides @xmath718 .",
    "however , for a non - trivial @xmath539 to occur , we must need at least one @xmath711 .",
    "this is consistent with theorem [ th5.5 ] , case ( ii ) , since there is only one factor in the above product when @xmath719 , which reduces to @xmath720 .",
    "it is direct to check that that for @xmath536 , it represents a tile digit set @xmath721 for @xmath539 , @xmath722 for @xmath656 , @xmath723 these three digit sets are up to an rearrangement of the factors so that the powers of @xmath38 are in non - decreasing order .",
    "the proof is basically identical to the case @xmath491 .",
    "first , it is easy to deduce lemma [ th5.7 ] for @xmath724 . for case * ( i ) * we first suppose that @xmath725 .",
    "the same argument shows that @xmath726 will divide @xmath718 .",
    "hence , we have type ( i ) using lemma [ th4.7 ] .",
    "suppose that the above factors does not divide @xmath718 .",
    "for those @xmath727 , we let @xmath728 be the first integer such that @xmath729 does not divide @xmath237 ( hence @xmath711 ) . by making use of the technique in theorem [ th5.5](i)-case(2 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath730 . note that @xmath731 where @xmath732 and @xmath41 are defined in the statement .",
    "hence , @xmath733 divides @xmath5(x ) .",
    "this forms @xmath269 of type ( ii ) which contains the kernel polynomial @xmath734 .",
    "the previous consideration for type ( iii ) applies in the same way .",
    "[ th5.9 ] let @xmath706 and let @xmath22 be a tile digit set @xmath707",
    ". then @xmath22 must be a @xmath61-order modulo product - form .",
    "it follows from the same idea of proof as theorem [ th5.6 ] , the first thing is to establish the analogue of lemma [ lem ] for @xmath543 , @xmath545 and @xmath544 given above .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath543 and @xmath544 are 1-st order product - form . for @xmath545 ,",
    "pick @xmath436 so that @xmath735 and @xmath736 , then we note that @xmath737 from this , we can use the same argument in lemma [ lem ] to conclude that @xmath545 is a product - form of some orders @xmath738 .",
    "next , we need to show that any tile digit sets must be given by the modulo product - forms of @xmath543 , @xmath545 and @xmath544 .",
    "this is done by arranging the powers of @xmath38 of those digit sets in non - decreasing order and applying the same argument in the proof of theorem [ th5.6 ] .",
    "we can eventually show that all are of modulo product - form of order @xmath739 .",
    "one of the aims in our investigation is to study the role of the modulo product - forms ( and the higher order ones ) in the tile digit sets , in particular , to characterize the tile digit sets to be such forms .",
    "so far we can only describe the modulo product - forms on @xmath9",
    ". it will be interesting to define the analog in the higher dimensional spaces .",
    "note that the definition of the product - form is easy to be generalized ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , however , there is no direct generalization for the modulo product - form .",
    "one of the main difficulties is to find some replacement of the cyclotomic polynomials . in another direction",
    ", it will also be useful to develop an algorithm to check for a given digit set @xmath740 to be a tile digit set .",
    "the main techniques we use in the explicit characterization for the tile digit sets of @xmath741 is the classical results of de bruijn about @xmath742 ( theorem [ th4.2 ] ) , and the decomposition of integer tiles @xmath56 when @xmath743 ( theorem [ th4.4 ] ) .",
    "it is likely that our approach can further be improved to obtain a complete characterization of tile tile digit sets of @xmath744 ( as well as integer tiles @xmath56 of the same cardinality ) as certain kind of modulo product - forms as in theorems [ th5.8 ] , [ th5.9 ] .",
    "finally and more challengingly , if @xmath357 or @xmath745 has more than two prime factors , some new factorization theorems may need to be developed .",
    "our study of the structure of the tile digit sets is closely related to the spectral set problems .",
    "recall that a closed subset @xmath746 is called a _",
    "spectral set _",
    "if @xmath747 admits an exponential orthonormal basis @xmath748 ( @xmath749 is called a spectrum ) .",
    "the well - known fuglede conjecture asserted that @xmath750 is a spectral set if and only if it is a translational tile . the conjecture was eventually proved to be false on @xmath1 for @xmath751 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the conjecture is still widely open for self - affine tiles .",
    "our consideration on cyclotomic polynomials factors for the tile digit sets is closely linked to the spectral problem , because it also deals with zeros on the unit circle .",
    "it would be instructive to first study the spectral problem for simpler product - form as a testing case .",
    "on the other hand , there are studies of the spectral problem for integer tiles on @xmath9 @xcite . in view of theorem [ th2.4 ] , the results can be applied to the tile digit sets , and it may offer some insight to investigate the spectral problem of the self - affine tiles ."
