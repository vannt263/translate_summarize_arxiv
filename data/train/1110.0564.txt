    "in an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , the bit error rate ( ber ) decreases exponentially with signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for various error correcting codes and modulation schemes ( @xcite,@xcite ) for high signal to noise ratios .",
    "however , this diversity order ( rate of decay of ber with snr ) also depends upon the transmission rate . the fundamental tradeoff between diversity order and the transmission rate ( converted to multiplexing gain by normalization with the rate of a standard awgn channel )",
    "was first investigated in the seminal paper @xcite for slow fading channel .    in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite a different approach is taken .",
    "the authors consider awgn and fast fading channels , bpsk modulation and use error exponents to obtain diversity rate tradeoff for systems with channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter and receiver .",
    "diversity order in @xcite , @xcite is defined as the slope of the average error probability vs snr at a particular snr . at high snr",
    "it can be approximated by the slope of the outage probability vs snr as defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , @xcite that the capacity region can be divided in three regions ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the diversity order can be qualitatively different in the three regions .",
    "in particular , it was shown that in low and high rate region the block error probability decreases exponentially with snr while for the medium rate region the decrease is polynomial .",
    "these results were observed for an awgn channel ( without fading ) also .",
    "these results , not reported before , beg the following questions . are these results specific to bpsk only ?",
    "since these results are observed for upper bounds , do they also hold for practical coding and modulation schemes ? do the lower bounds satisfy these unusual characteristics ?",
    "the present study is motivated by these questions . theoretically and via extensive computations and simulations",
    "we provide answers to some of these questions . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to an awgn channel . in future",
    "work we will report our investigations on fading channels .    in the literature there has been much work on the upper and lower bounds on error probability for an awgn channel .",
    "the upper bound on average decoding error probability with and without input constraints is given by gallager in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this upper bound depends on the input distribution and the constellation used for the modulation . in @xcite ,",
    "the optimal constellation is derived by maximizing the error exponent in the upper bound .",
    "these have been studied for continuous inputs also with average and peak power constraints on the input distribution ( chap.7 , @xcite ) , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these upper bounds is that they are independent of the constellation and the modulation used .",
    "the lower bounds are also extensively studied in the literature .",
    "broadly there are two types of lower bounds on the probability of decoding error .",
    "the sphere packing lower bounds ( spb ) are lower bounds for all block codes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another type of lower bounds depend on the distance spectrum of codes ( for specific codes , not ensembles ) with bpsk input @xcite .",
    "the classical sphere packing lower bound on the probability of error are shannon s lower bound ( sp59 ) for continuous input and large block lengths @xcite and shannon , gallager , berlekamp s lower bound ( sp67 ) @xcite on probability of error for a discrete input and discrete output channel .",
    "valembois and fossorier @xcite extended the lower bound ( sp67 ) to a continuous output channel .",
    "an improved sphere packing lower bound ( isp ) obtained is @xcite for a discrete input and symmetric output channel .",
    "thus presently for continuous input , the tightest lower bound is shannon s 1959 bound @xcite while for discrete input and continuous output it is isp @xcite .",
    "the error exponents for the upper and lower bounds ( @xcite , @xcite ) are equal in the high rate region ( region 3 ) but not in region 2 ( mid rate region ) and region 1 ( low rate region ) . in a small fraction of region 2 , burnashev @xcite has shown that the error exponents for the upper and lower bounds are equal . even though the error exponents are equal in high rate region ( region 3 ) , the corresponding bounds on probability of error are not tight for finite block lengths even in region 3 .    in this paper , we study the diversity order of an awgn channel with m - ary psk ( bpsk , qpsk , 8 psk , 16 psk ) , optimum constellation and continuous constellation . we show that the distance spectrum lower bounds and gallagher s upper bounds are close to the simulated values for probability of error of practical codes .",
    "in fact for large block length the gallagher s upper bounds can be quite close to the performance of the practical codes .",
    "therefore , we study the diversity order of these bounds closely . although we observe exponential diversity in most of the capacity region , there is a polynomial diversity in a significant rate region of practical importance for all the constellations stated above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] deals with discrete input constellation . in this section ,",
    "we provide the results for m - ary and optimum constellation .",
    "the results obtained from upper bounds are supported with lower bounds and simulations . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "results are provided for continuous constellation .",
    "section [ sec4 ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an awgn channel with input @xmath0 and output @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is independent of @xmath0 with gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we take @xmath0 with values in a finite alphabet @xmath5 .",
    "we study the upper and lower bounds on probability of error for different constellations and compare with the performance of practical codes .",

    "the three rate regions are as follows : region 1 is @xmath14 , region 2 is @xmath15 and region 3 is @xmath16 . for m - ary psk modulation ( usually considered in literature @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "the signal points are equally spaced on a circle .",
    "the modulation symbols have equal energy ( say 1 ) . we treat the channel input @xmath0 and output @xmath1 as 2 dimensional real vectors .",
    "the input @xmath17 takes values @xmath18 where @xmath19      we consider two lower bounds .",
    "one is the classical sphere packing lower bound ( isp ) .",
    "the other is a lower bound based on improvements on the de cane s inequality provided in @xcite .",
    "the second bound is complex to evaluate for large codes .",
    "if we specialize it to bpsk modulation , the resulting bound depends on the code only through its weight enumeration ( distance spectrum of the code ) and is easier to evaluate .",
    "thus we use the improved isp bound from @xcite and distance spectrum bound from @xcite .",
    "these are currently the best available lower bounds .      in this section ,",
    "we numerically evaluate the upper bound and the lower bounds described above .",
    "we also compare these bounds with simulation results for practical codes .",
    "we study the diversity - rate tradeoff for m - ary psk input with uniform distribution .",
    "we also simulate the communication system with bch encoding and decoding techniques with m - ary psk modulated signals to evaluate the block error probability .",
    "these are well known codes and were selected for their good performance in different applications ( e.g. , in header - error protection of atm cells and video codec for audio visual services @xcite ) .    in figs.[awgn_bpsk1]-[awgn_16psk2 ] , we plot logarithm of probability of error vs logarithm of snr ( db ) for bpsk , 8psk and 16 psk modulation schemes .",
    "we also provide simulations for bch codes .",
    "the three rate regions are demarcated by vertical lines .",
    "we observe ( figs.[awgn_bpsk1]-[awgn_16psk2 ] ) from the upper bound that the decay of probability of error with snr is exponential in region 3 , changes to polynomial in region 2 and then again to exponential in region 1 .",
    "similar trend was also seen in @xcite for bpsk .",
    "this is an interesting result because for an awgn channel , the probability of error for practical modulation and coding schemes ( @xcite,@xcite ) is upper bounded in terms of summation of @xmath20 functions where @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the modulation and coding scheme .",
    "there is no closed form expression for the @xmath23 function . from the approximate formulae @xcite",
    ", one observes the exponential decay of probability of error with respect to snr .",
    "but , this approximation is valid only for high snr . in our figures ,",
    "we consider both high and low snr rate regions . for our bch simulation results",
    "also we see only exponential decay .",
    "we do not see similar changes of slope ( as for the upper bounds ) for the lower bounds figs [ awgn_bpsk1 ] , [ awgn_bpsk2 ] .",
    "there is exponential decay throughout . for bpsk modulation , in fig.[awgn_bpsk1 ] and [ awgn_bpsk2 ] for different block lengths and rates , we observe that the simulations are closer to the upper bound in region 3 and part of region 2 .",
    "the isp lower bound is very far off while the distance spectrum lower bound is closer .                        from figs.[awgn_8psk2 ] and",
    "[ awgn_16psk2 ] , we observe that even for higher modulation schemes the upper bound is quite close to the simulated values in region 3 and upper part of region 2 . fortunately ,",
    "these are the regions of most practical interest . for bpsk , 8 psk and 16 psk modulation schemes ,",
    "the region 2 is 2.5 db for block length 255 and coding rate 0.968 bps .    from figs.[awgn_bpsk1]-[awgn_16psk2 ]",
    ", we also observe that the simulated curve for the bch codes decay exponentially throughout but the error exponents for them are smaller than for the upper bound in region 3 .",
    "the non - exponential upper bounds in region 2 seem to have an effect on this .",
    "one of the applications of an awgn channel without fading is a wireline channel .",
    "the itu - t recommendation g.821 for bit error rate ( ber ) for data circuits is @xmath24 and for telegraph circuits is @xmath25 .",
    "for ber @xmath26 and @xmath27 bps , we get @xmath28 . in fig.[awgn_bpsk2 ] , we consider bpsk modulation with @xmath29 and @xmath27 bps . in this case ,",
    "region 3 is @xmath30 db where @xmath31 values are from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and region 2 is @xmath34 db where @xmath31 values are from @xmath33 to @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the region 3 and upper part of region 2 are regions of practical interest .",
    "this is the region for which we have obtained interesting new properties for the upper bound and this is also the region where these bounds are close to the ber of practical codes .",
    "thus in the rest of the paper we will focus on upper bounds and theoretically show the interesting diversity - rate tradeoff observed in this section .",
