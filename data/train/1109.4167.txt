    "fossil groups ( fgs ) are systems dominated by a single , giant elliptical galaxy , yet their x - ray emission indicates a deeper cluster - scale gravitational potential .",
    "they are generally defined as systems with a @xmath1 = 2 magnitude difference between the first and second rank galaxies within @xmath2 , and they have an extended thermal x - ray halo with @xmath3 erg  s@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "fgs are thought to be old , isolated galaxy groups and clusters in which the large galaxies have coalesced through dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "this coalesced cluster scenario is further supported by high x - ray temperature measurements ( up to @xmath5 4 kev ) and by the galaxy velocity dispersions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high nfw @xcite halo concentration parameters , lack of spectral star formation indicators , and large @xmath1 magnitude difference suggest these systems finished merging in the distant past , perhaps before @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent studies of x - ray selected fgs paint a more complicated picture .",
    "the cooling time of fgs is significantly shorter than the hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet they typically lack cool cores , suggesting that these systems may be younger or more active than previously thought @xcite .",
    "regular ( non - fossil ) rich groups often possess cool cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even in the presence of agn activity .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for enhanced sn ii metal fraction in the central regions of fgs , suggesting a scenario where sn ii powered winds resulting from merging late type galaxies erase the original central sn ia fe mass fraction dominance @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the previously found disky isophotes of the central dominant galaxies in fgs by @xcite and also with the presence of shells in the stellar component in at least one of these galaxies , indicative of multiple past mergers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some authors suggest that the fgs we see are the tail of the cluster distribution , possessing few @xmath7 galaxies at their current epoch for any number of reasons : failure to form those galaxies , early merging , or a quiescent state during a cycle of galaxy accretion @xcite . the truth about fossil groups is somewhat muddled by the phenomenological rather than physical definition of the class . extracting a useful physical definition",
    "is in turn complicated by the relatively small number of fgs with deep x - ray observations .",
    "indeed , what we call `` fossil groups '' perhaps comprise a heterogeneous set of galaxy systems with different formation and evolution histories .    to characterize the ages and structural properties of fgs , it is crucial to have good data , especially x - ray observations .",
    "detailed study of the intra - group medium ( igm ) metal abundance , temperature structure , and inferred mass distribution help to constrain the halo formation epoch and the importance of recent star formation or agn activity .",
    "the available x - ray data are typically photon - poor due to the serendipitous nature of fg detections , and this has limited their study .",
    "to address this problem , we have embarked on a project to identify a large sample of fgs for future detailed follow - up studies . in the work presented here ,",
    "we have constructed a sample of 15 fossil group candidates , using the maxbcg cluster catalog @xcite to optically identify the candidates , which are then targeted with x - ray snapshots using the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory to confirm the existence of a bright x - ray halo .",
    "this initial sample of confirmed fgs ( using the phenomenological classification ) will be invaluable for follow - up , including deep x - ray observations to study the metallicity structure of the gas and concentration of the mass distribution ; and optical spectroscopy to compare the velocity dispersion to the x - ray mass .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( or @xmath12 ) . except where specified with @xmath13 notation ,",
    "all numerical values from the literature have been scaled to correspond to this cosmology .",
    "uncertainties are 1@xmath14 and upper / lower limits are 3@xmath14 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "to select a large sample of fg targets , we used the maxbcg cluster catalog @xcite .",
    "this is a volume - limited catalog of over 17,000 optically selected red - sequence clusters in the redshift range @xmath15 with precise photometric redshifts ( @xmath16 ) and optical richness estimates from the sloan digital sky survey dr4 ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optical richness employed , @xmath17 , is the number of red - sequence member galaxies brighter than @xmath18 ( in the @xmath19-band ) found within a scale radius  of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mean properties of this catalog have been studied in detail , and we have obtained mean x - ray luminosities  @xcite , velocity dispersions  @xcite , and a mass calibration via the mean weak - lensing shear profile around maxbcg clusters @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that the catalog purity and completeness are very high ( @xmath2090 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we selected for several optical characteristics that are expected of fgs from the empirical definition of the class .",
    "in particular , at a given optical richness , these systems should have a larger magnitude difference between the bcg and the next brightest galaxy and should have highly luminous bcgs typical of massive clusters . in our initial selection",
    "we restricted ourselves to systems in the richness range @xmath21 , corresponding to a mass range of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "our aim was to select systems rich enough to have sufficient x - ray luminosity for detection and analysis , and at the same time remain in the fg range where the bcg can truly dominate the system .",
    "we note that the publicly released maxbcg catalog was restricted to @xmath23 ; we used a slightly extended catalog described by @xcite , including an additional 3532 clusters with @xmath24 and allowing us to use the same richness bins studied in the analysis of maxbcg galaxy dynamics @xcite and weak lensing @xcite . to maximize the flux in the x - ray",
    ", we restricted the sample to those systems with a confirmed spectroscopic bcg redshift in the range @xmath25 ; the lower redshift cut is imposed by the maxbcg photometric redshift lower limit of @xmath26 . at the time of selection from sdss dr4",
    ", 42% of all maxbcg clusters in this redshift range had a spectroscopically determined bcg redshift .    to quantify the galaxy magnitude gap representative of fgs , we used the difference in @xmath19-band magnitude of the bcg and the next brightest red - sequence cluster member within @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 values were estimated from the mass - scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "bright non - red - sequence galaxies projected within @xmath27 were not considered because the majority of these are foreground galaxies unassociated with the cluster .",
    "thus , we have opted for a more complete sample of systems with this magnitude gap at the risk of a small amount of impurity .",
    "we refined our selection to all the systems with @xmath30 and bcg @xmath19-band luminosity @xmath31 ( @xmath32 in our adopted cosmological framework ) .",
    "there were 26 maxbcg systems that passed this selection cut .",
    "we illustrate the maxbcg selection in figure  [ fig : selection ] , plotting @xmath28 as a function of @xmath33 ; these two values are correlated , as the most luminous bcgs also tend to have a large @xmath28 . however",
    ", richer maxbcg clusters ( @xmath34 ) in the same redshift range ( magenta points ) do not extend this trend to the largest @xmath28 , despite having relatively larger @xmath33 .",
    "we discuss selection effects of our sample more fully in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "the cuts based on these parameters are consistent with the majority of known fg systems  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that overlap the sdss footprint , marked with blue diamonds in figure  [ fig : selection ] .",
    "these five systems are present in the maxbcg catalog , however they each fail one or more of our selection criteria , with four falling out of our redshift range and the fifth having @xmath35 .",

    ". the @xmath5 15 arcsec spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _  corresponds to 30 kpc at @xmath36 .",
    "this is a sizeable fraction of the typical group core radius , so to maximize the utility of these targets for deeper x - ray spectroscopic analysis we sought to reduce the possibility of bright central agn emission that might contaminate the diffuse igm emission .",

    "additionally , we rejected all bcgs that match radio sources in the first catalog @xcite within 3 arcsec of the bcg position ( 6 kpc at @xmath36 ) , eliminating another 6 candidates .",
    "finally , we rejected 2 systems that have bright stars with @xmath38 in the field - of - view that exceed the bright star limit for _ xmm - newton_. in total , we identified 15 candidate fgs , marked with red squares in figure  [ fig : selection ] and summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",

    "it is clear that the stacked x - ray emission of this sample is significantly extended when compared to a rass point source . ]",
    "the elimination of candidates based on agn activity , especially in the radio , could produce a selection bias .",
    "the motivation for this selection was based on @xcite and @xcite , who find a clear correlation between bondi accretion rate and central engine jet power in samples of low - power radio galaxies .",
    "the presence of radio emission from a jet or expanding bubbles is a signal of strong accretion , with rate @xmath42 . as the x - ray emission measure of this plasma",
    "is @xmath43 , the flux within the central few kpc can be quite bright and contaminate the _ xmm - newton _  surface brightness profile , and through an abundance of caution , we expunged these radio - bright candidates .",
    "the direct correlation between agn radio and x - ray luminosity in bcgs is not well constrained , although @xcite find a small overlap ( @xmath5 10% ) between radio- and x - ray - bright agn in general , with the former tending to live in luminous red sequence galaxies and the latter tending to `` green valley '' galaxies .",
    "the possible effects of this selection on our sample are discussed in section  [ sect : success ] .",
    "the final criterion in the fg definition is a cluster - scale x - ray halo , which also serves as confirmation of a collapsed system rather than a projection of unrelated galaxies . while six of the fg candidates are bright enough to be detected at the @xmath44 level in the _ rosat _",

    "thus while some strong cool core fgs may have escaped our sample , it remains useful for future radio studies , and we expect little bias in @xmath191 given the large measurement uncertainties in the current analysis .",
    "a deeper _ xmm - newton _  study will allow removal of the core emission when assembling scaling relations , a technique that greatly reduces scatter and does not produce any apparent bias @xcite .",
