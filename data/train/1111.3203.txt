    "the dynamical systems with fractional dynamics are adequate for the description of various physical phenomena in viscoelasticity , diffusion processes , dielectric relaxation , etc @xcite . however , now the analysis of nonlinear differential equations with fractional derivatives is in early development .",
    "the point is that on the one hand the derivation of such equations from some initial principles is in the making . on the other hand",
    "the numerical simulation of fractional differential equations are enough expensive  @xcite . in the present state of affairs",
    "it may follow a formal way by changing the derivatives of integer order in the well - known nonlinear equations on the derivative of an arbitrary order .",
    "this means a search to the touch together with overcoming the difficulties of numerical analysis .",
    "so that was at the beginning of fractional calculus .",
    "but there exists an alternative way .",
    "the other approach may be based on the recent success in the study of linear fractional differential equations . in particular ,",
    "the linear fractional equations have been well investigated analytically in detail @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the fractional oscillator and the fractional relaxation have an clear physical interpretation @xcite .",
    "some nonlinear models turn out to be very close to linear ones in a sense .",
    "this permits one to combine analytical computations with simple numerical simulations .",
    "the aim of this work is to present one of such nonlinear systems under fractional dynamics .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ par2 ] is devoted to a derivation of the nonlinear reaction obeying a stochastic time arrow .",
    "the arrow leads to a system of fractional differential equations that describe the process evolution .",
    "one of the equations can be resolved by analytical methods .",
    "the sum of the two others has also an clear analytical form .",
    "the feature analysis is represented in section  [ par3 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the system of the equations upon the whole is nonlinear .",
    "therefore , the next step is directed to numerical simulations of those equations what can not be resolved analytically .",
    "we rewrite them in the integral form and apply a recursive procedure of numerical fractional integration .",
    "it should be observed here that the results obtained in section  [ par3 ] proves to be useful for section  [ par4 ] .",
    "we sum up and discuss the outcome in section  [ par5 ] .",
    "the nonlinear processes play an important role in the kinetics of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the typical example is a reaction in the gas that consists of atoms of two grades ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . the reaction @xmath2 creates two - atom molecules . in the same time",
    "it is not impossible an inverse process , dissociation @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamical system can be described by differential equations in the nonlinear form .",
    "one of similar nonlinear reactions is mentioned in @xcite .",
    "its temporal evolution is written as @xmath4 with the initial condition @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the common number of atoms , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 the number of molecules of three types arising from the chemical reaction of the atoms .",
    "the equation for @xmath12 is linear and is independent from @xmath13 and @xmath14 . using the stochastic time arrow described in @xcite , the equation is easily generalized in the fractional form .",
    "the stochastic time arrow characterizes an interaction of a physical system with environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "then the time variable becomes a sum of random temporal non - negative intervals @xmath15 .",
    "they are independent identically distributed variables belonging to a lvy - stable distribution .",
    "their sum gives asymptotically a stable distribution with the index @xmath16 .",
    "following the arguments of @xcite , a new time clock is defined as a continuous limit of the discrete counting process @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the set of natural numbers .",
    "the time clock is the hitting time process @xmath19 .",
    "its basic properties has been represented in @xcite .",
    "the probability density of the process @xmath19 is written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the bromwich path .",
    "this probability density has a clear physical sense .",
    "it defines the probability to be at the internal time @xmath22 on the real time @xmath23 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "let us make use of the general kinetic equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 defines the transition probability ( or the concentration of a substance ) in a system , @xmath26 is the transition operator between the system states . in a general case the operator",
    "@xmath26 may be even nonlinear .",
    "provided that it is independent on time explicitly .",
    "now we determine a new process with the probability @xmath27 it is that the function @xmath28 characterizes the stochastic time arrow .",
    "the laplace transform of the probabilities @xmath29 and @xmath25 gives the relation @xmath30 with @xmath16 , and the laplace image of @xmath31 is written as @xmath32 by the simple algebraic computations we have @xmath33 after the laplace inverse transform the fractional representation of eq.([eq02 ] ) takes the form @xmath34 although eq.([eq04 ] ) is integral , it can be expressed in terms of fractional derivative @xcite .",
    "this approach permits one to generalize eqs.([eq01 ] ) in that way too . for more details , see the next section .",
    "consider the following nonlinear system described by fractional differential equations @xcite @xmath35 under the initial condition @xmath36 where @xmath16 . here",
    "the fractional operator @xmath37 is supposed in the sense of caputo @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 means the @xmath40-derivative of @xmath31 . to sum up eqs.([eq1 ] ) , we get @xmath41 the system analysis shows above all that the first equation for @xmath42 is linear .",
    "it may be integrated analytically , namely @xmath43 .",
    "the variable @xmath42 is expressed in term of the one - parameter mittag - leffler function @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the value @xmath42 becomes vanishingly small with @xmath45 as @xmath46 . on the other hand , from the second and third equations it follows that the sum of @xmath47 and @xmath48 gives",
    "@xmath49 this means that the definition of @xmath42 allows one to establish the functional dependence between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the sum takes the form @xmath50 this result tends to one as @xmath45 .",
    "we find it useful to define the identity @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the two - parameter mittag - leffler function , and @xmath44 is a particular case of @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 .",
    "the laplace image of @xmath55 is written as @xmath56 while @xmath57 the sum of these images reduces to @xmath58 .    in the upshot",
    "it still remains to find the variable @xmath47 .",
    "the value satisfies a nonlinear fractional differential equation with the right - hand term .",
    "in other words this equation is inhomogeneous : @xmath59 its form is such that for the final conclusion it is necessary to provide a numerical simulation .",
    "nevertheless , our analytical analysis will not be full without asymptotic estimations as applied to @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath60 is equal to one , we can neglect the right - hand term because of its exponential decay .",
    "the value @xmath13 behaves algebraic for @xmath61 . if the index @xmath60 is otherwise ( @xmath62 ) , the right - hand term of eq.([eq2 ] )",
    "is the one - parameter mittag - leffler function having an algebraic asymptotic form .",
    "what term in eq.([eq2 ] ) gives a significant contribution in a given case ?",
    "the feature will be established by a numerical simulation more clearly .",
    "the variable @xmath13 becomes vanishingly small , when @xmath23 tends to infinity .",
    "nonlinear reaction with ordinary time evolution ( [ eq01]).,width=12 ]    moreover , the adomain s composition method assumes a series solution for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the first three terms of this series are given by @xmath63 they indicate the presence of a maximum .",
    "however , the determination of its properties ( position and value ) is not enough reliable for the composition method .",
    "the point is that the taylor series converges only for @xmath64 , but the maximum is the case for @xmath65 .",
    "thus the estimation ( [ eq4 ] ) for the maximum will not be exact .",
    "this can be easy to verify numerically for @xmath66 , using the usual methods ( for example , the runge - kutta technique or something like that ) . in this case , the system ( [ eq1 ] ) consists of first - order differential equations .",
    "their numerical solutions are represented in fig .",
    "to solve the nonlinear fractional differential equation , the principal approach is to use a numerical approximation of fractional integral .",
    "its advantage is due to the fact that the kernel of this integral is regular for @xmath67 , and weekly singular for @xmath62 , hence integrable ( at least in the improper sense ) for any index @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , the kernel of fractional derivative is not integrable , and it requires special regularization methods restricting possibilities of the numerical simulation @xcite .    let @xmath69 be a partition of the interval @xmath70 $ ] into a grid , where @xmath71 . according to @xcite , the fractional integral of the value @xmath72",
    "is computed as @xmath73 where the quadrature weights are derived from a product trapezoidal rule to the following : @xmath74 the error of this algorithm is of order @xmath75 .",
    "the accuracy can be improved by the richardson extrapolation procedure @xcite .",
    "fractional one - half - order integral of the exponential function , @xmath76 , obtained from eq.([eq6 ] ) ( line ) and by means of eq.([eq5 ] ) ( circles).,width=12 ]    as an example to this algorithm , we suggest to consider the fractional one - half - order integral of the exponential function .",
    "the integral has an analytical representation : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the imaginary error function .",
    "the transcendental function is expanded into a taylor series about @xmath79 : @xmath80 the expansion allows one to compare @xmath81 in the analytical form ( [ eq6 ] ) with the numerical simulation result of the fractional integral by means of the above - mentioned algorithm ( [ eq5 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "nonlinear reaction with time evolution under fractional derivative with the index @xmath82.,width=12 ]    next we transform eq.([eq2 ] ) into the integral form : @xmath83 it is useful to remark the following property : @xmath84 . as @xmath85 , it is easy to find @xmath86 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath13 is too strong .",
    "as will be shown below , @xmath13 is less than one .",
    "the positivity property of @xmath13 at any time is very important .",
    "the same exists also for @xmath12 and @xmath14 . both functions @xmath12 and @xmath14",
    "are completely monotonic , but @xmath13 is not .",
    "the latter has a maximum .    applying the approximation ( [ eq5 ] ) , eq.([eq7 ] )",
    "is written as @xmath87 the expression takes the form of an ordinary quadratic equation : @xmath88 then the recursive procedure is obtained in an elementary manner .",
    "the numerical scheme permits one to calculate @xmath89 from @xmath90 to solve the quadratic equation .",
    "each subsequent value of @xmath47 depends on previous ones , because the fractional integration exhibits a long - term memory loss . for computing the one - parameter mittag - leffler function",
    "@xmath91 we use a numerical scheme listed in algorithm 4 @xcite that is reproduced with minor corrections from @xcite . the quadratic equation ( [ eq8 ] )",
    "has two solutions .",
    "one of them is positive , and another is negative .",
    "we select the non - negative solution in the force of the above analysis to the analytical properties of @xmath13 .",
    "the temporal evolution of this system for @xmath82 is shown in fig .",
    "formally , the system behavior for @xmath62 is like to the system one for @xmath66 : the variable @xmath12 monotonically tends to zero , the variable @xmath14 to one , and the variable @xmath13 possesses one maximum after which it decays to zero .",
    "but there are differences that we discuss in the next section .",
    "peak amplitude of the variable @xmath47 for @xmath92 in the nonlinear reaction with fractional dynamics.,width=12 ]    this approach to the numerical simulation of the system ( [ eq1 ] ) has the following advantages .",
    "firstly , the numerical errors are of the order @xmath75 .",
    "if we use algorithm 3 from @xcite , they would be of the order @xmath93 , i.  e.they would be slightly more . moreover , algorithm 3 is not less expensive than the procedure ( [ eq5 ] ) . a reduction in the amount of computational work can be achieved by using a graded mesh , thereby taking the o(@xmath94 ) method of ( [ eq5 ] ) and making it o(@xmath95 )",
    ". this will be the same as in algorithm 3 .",
    "thirdly , the richardson extrapolation procedure , improving the numerical simulation accuracy , does not have been proved still for algorithm 3 .",
    "hence , its application to algorithm 3 is only based on assumptions of its expected correctness @xcite . as for the procedure ( [ eq5 ] ) , the use of the richardson extrapolation is exactly true for any @xmath68 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that algorithm 3 itself can not yield a numerical solution of nonlinear fractional equations",
    ". the algorithm should be added by calculating zeros of the corresponding function of one variable .",
    "it is that the variable is a required solution .",
    "however , this way to numerical simulations of nonlinear fractional equations is not considered in the review @xcite . in our opinion",
    "the approach has good perspectives .",
    "the variables @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 describe a relaxation of substances in some physical system more than anything yet .",
    "and what is why .",
    "one of its possible interpretations lies in the representation of the process as a reaction .",
    "some substance promotes an initiation of two other interacting substances .",
    "one of them is metastable and transforms into another . but",
    "this reaction does not occur at once .",
    "it evolutes in time .",
    "therefore the change of the variables @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 manifests something like a relaxation .    let us choose the index @xmath60 as a governing parameter .",
    "this means that we will change it from zero to one for establishing how it influences on the character of the system ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the key characteristics of this system is a temporal position of the @xmath47 s maximum and its value .",
    "the results can be only obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "they are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "the first observation shows that the model ( [ eq1 ] ) with the index @xmath66 is well agreed with the models for @xmath96 . otherwise speaking , all they together form a smooth line in the interval @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] has been shown for @xmath97 to be easy to recognize a minimum in this dependence on @xmath60 .",
    "really , the minimum is the case for @xmath98 .",
    "this indicates that at first the temporal position comes to the abscissa axis , when the index @xmath60 changes from one to @xmath99 .",
    "however , the next decay evolution of the index leads to the motion of the @xmath47 s maximum outside of the abscissa axis .",
    "the peak amplitude has a completely monotonic character depending on @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "time position of the @xmath47 s maximum in the dependence of the index @xmath60 for the nonlinear reaction with fractional dynamics.,width=12 ]    by the concrete example we have shown that the numerical procedure of fractional integration can provide a convergent method for the solution of nonlinear systems of fractional differential equations . the approximation series solution ( adomian decomposition )",
    "is not so successful because of the too slow convergence of the corresponding series expansion for such a type of equations .",
    "therefore , in this case the decomposition plays only a secondary role .",
    "although the approximation series solution can be obtained to any desirable number of terms , this makes the method expensive and ineffective .",
    "probably , it would be better to add the algorithm by an asymptotic expansion .",
    "however , it is difficult to suggest any universal method .",
    "thus , the numerical simulations turn out to be especially useful for the analysis of nonlinear fractional differential equations .",
