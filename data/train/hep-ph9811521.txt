    "the standard electroweak theory ( sm ) provides a very satisfactory description of most elementary particle phenomena up to the presently available energies .",
    "however , the sm has many problems : the spectrum of elementary fermions , no unifications of the forces , violation of cp and the existence of many parameters .",
    "concerning to the first problem , there is no theoretical explanation for the existence of several generations and for the values of the masses .",
    "it was established at the cern @xmath1 collider lep that the number of light neutrinos is three @xcite .",
    "however this result does not impede the assumption that further generations coluld exist @xcite .",
    "many models , such as composite models @xcite , grand unified theories @xcite , technicolor models @xcite , superstring - inspired models @xcite , mirror fermions @xcite , predict the existence of new particles with masses around of the scale of @xmath2 tev and they consider the possible existence of new generations of fermions .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider the possibility of existence of a new generation of leptons and analyze the production of exotic heavy leptons in the large hadron collider lhc ( @xmath3 tev ) .",
    "we present here another form to produce these leptons , namely through the reactions @xmath4 , and we show that the production of a pair of exotic leptons are competitive with the ones for the single heavy lepton , that is so , due to the vector component of the z - boson coupling to exotic leptons and to the exchange of a photon in the @xmath5 channel , although the phase space is more reduced for pair production than for single heavy lepton production",
    ".    we also study the production of pair of exotic leptons through the drell - yan mechanism and we will see that this production is dominant over the single heavy lepton production @xcite .",
    "the three models that we consider here include new fermionic degrees of freedom , which introduce naturally a number of unknown mixing angles and fermionic masses @xcite .",
    "these models are : the vector singlet model ( vsm ) @xcite , vector doublet model ( vdm ) @xcite and the fermion - mirror - fermion ( fmf ) model @xcite .",
    "exotic leptons mixed with the standard leptons interact through the standard weak vector bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 , according to the interacting lagrangians    @xmath8 z_{\\mu }   \\label{lag1}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the corresponding neutral vector - axial coupling constants and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the charged vector - axial coupling constants , which are given in @xcite for each of the three models that we study here .    in this work",
    "we deal only with the lepton sector . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that for the process @xmath14 is a difficult task to distinguish the vsm and vdm leptons since they have similar cross sections and angular distributions .",
    "this is not the case for fmf leptons , whose cross section and angular distribution is different from the other class of leptons . in this work",
    "we will show that , for the process @xmath15 will be possible to distinguish the vsm leptons from the vdm and fmf leptons .",
    "we consider here that all mixing angles have the same value @xmath16 , although phenomenological analysis @xcite gives an upper bound of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath18 can be scaled up to @xmath19 .",

    "it is seem not a difficult matter to distinguish the vsm leptons from the other two class of leptons .",
    "however this is not the case between vdm leptons and fmf leptons , because the difference between these two classes of particles are only @xmath84 .",
