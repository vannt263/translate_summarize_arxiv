    "sediment transport in a newtonian fluid , such as water and air , is one of the most important geological processes responsible for the alteration of sea and riverscapes , and dry planetary surfaces @xcite .",
    "it can occur in a large variety of natural environments , e.g. , viscous and turbulent transport of minerals and organics by earth s water streams @xcite , turbulent transport of dust and sand by earth s atmospheric winds @xcite , and wind - driven transport of minerals on planetary bodies with extremely thin atmospheres , such as triton , pluto , and comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko @xcite .",
    "different sediment transport regimes are documented .",
    "very small particles , whose weight can be fully supported by the fluid turbulence , tend to be transported in turbulent suspensions @xcite .",
    "medium and large particles , on the other hand , are transported close to the surface , in trajectories not much influenced by fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "the latter case includes bedload and saltation transport .",
    "bedload transport refers to particles rolling , sliding , and hopping in the vicinity of the sediment bed , which is typical for the transport of sand and gravel by water streams @xcite .",
    "saltation transport refers to particles moving in ballistic trajectories along the bed , which is typical for the transport of sand by planetary winds @xcite .",
    "it has become a widely - accepted hypothesis that the mechanisms sustaining bedload and saltation transport are fundamentally different : bedload transport being sustained through entrainment of soil bed particles directly by fluid forces @xcite and saltation transport being sustained through particle - bed impacts ejecting bed particles @xcite , allowing transport even below the fluid entrainment threshold @xcite . however , recent studies have questioned this hypothesis by pointing out the role of particle inertia for sustaining bedload transport @xcite , and by showing that an analytical model taking into account particle dynamics is able to reproduce measurements of bedload and saltation transport thresholds at the same time @xcite .",
    "here we study the relevance of impact entrainment relative to direct fluid entrainment in a unified manner using direct numerical simulations of sediment transport in a newtonian fluid with the model of ref .",

    "first , we present direct evidence from visual inspection of these simulations showing that impact entrainment events play a crucial role during both steady bedload and saltation transport .",
    "then we quantitatively analyze the relative role of impact entrainment from our simulation data using a proxy that is similar but not identical to the classical ` slip velocity ' ( i.e. , the average horizontal particle velocity at the bed surface @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis reveals a crucial influence of a novel dimensionless number , henceforth called ` impact number ' , @xmath20 , where @xmath2 is the particle - fluid - density ratio and @xmath3 the particle reynolds number , with @xmath6 the gravitational constant , @xmath7 the mean particle diameter , and @xmath8 the kinematic viscosity . finally , we shed light on possible links between impact entrainment and average transport characteristics , such as the scaling of the sediment transport rate @xmath21 with the dimensionless fluid shear stress ( the `` shields number '' @xmath4 $ ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is a widespread believe that impact entrainment inevitably causes a ( nearly ) linear scaling @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the extrapolated value of @xmath19 at which @xmath21 vanishes @xcite .",
    "here we challenge this believe .",
    "the reminder of the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ simulations ] briefly summarizes important details of the numerical model .",
    "section  [ visualizationsimpact ] presents and discusses the evidence for impact entrainment in both bedload and saltation transport obtained from visualizations of the numerical simulations .",
    "section  [ proxy ] represents the core of the paper .",
    "it introduces the proxy we use to quantify the relative role of impact entrainment , explains why other proxies , such as the slip velocity , are inappropriate , and analyzes our proxy over the entire range of simulated conditions .",
    "section  [ implications ] discusses possible links between impact entrainment and average transport characteristics .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and draw conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the numerical model of sediment transport in newtonian fluids of ref .",
    "@xcite couples a discrete element method for the particle motion ( @xmath24 spheres , including @xmath25 layers of sediment bed particles ) and a continuum reynolds - averaged description of hydrodynamics .",
    "the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equations are combined with an improved mixing length approximation , which can be used to calculate the turbulent mean fluid velocity at high particle concentrations .",
    "in contrast to the original model , which considers only gravity , buoyancy , and fluid drag forces acting on particles , we here also consider the added - mass force @xcite .",
    "however , cohesive and higher - order fluid forces , such as the hindrance and lift force remain neglected .",
    "we also corrected two slight inaccuracies in the original model ( with mostly negligible effect on the simulation outcome ) .",
    "we here take into account that the fluid shear stress is proportional to the fluid volume fraction and neglect the buoyancy contribution from the divergence of the fluid shear stress because the divergence of the reynolds stress , previously considered , actually does not contribute to the buoyancy force .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that all results presented in this study for the bedload transport regime usually do not significantly depend on contact parameters , such as the restitution coefficient @xmath26 and contact friction coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , bedload transport simulations with @xmath28 and @xmath29 are nearly exactly the same on average , which is consistent with previous reports @xcite .",
    "this finding implies that any dissipative interaction force that is proportional to the relative velocity of two approaching particles and acts at and/or close to particle contact , such as the lubrication force @xcite , does not significantly influence average bedload transport characteristics because the effect of such forces can be incorporated in @xmath26 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we carried out simulations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 within the range @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] and for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "for each pair of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we varied @xmath19 in regular intervals and obtained the cessation threshold ( @xmath23 ) through extrapolation to vanishing sediment transport @xcite .",
    "figure  [ visualizations ] shows snapshots of transport simulations near @xmath23 for turbulent bedload ( fig .  [ visualizations]a ) and saltation transport ( fig .",
    "[ visualizations]b ) shortly before and after an impact entrainment event ( see also movies  s1 and s2 ) . in both cases ,",
    "a transported particle collides with one or more bed particles , which subsequently become mobilized with a short time delay . in bedload transport , the transported particle impacts the bed from a very small height and entrains a bed particle by dragging it out of its trap , while in saltation transport , the transported particle impacts the bed from a very large height and entrains a bed particle by ejecting it .",
    "close to the threshold , impact entrainment events are rare in both cases as impacts occur much less often , but are much more effective in saltation than they are in turbulent bedload transport ( movies  s1 and s2 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "bed particles remain in repose most of the time because fluid forces are too weak to entrain them directly . sufficiently far from the threshold ,",
    "impact entrainment events occur much more often in saltation transport ( movie  s3 ) , whereas it is impossible to determine single entrainment events in turbulent bedload transport as several layers of the bed are in continuous motion ( movie  s4 ) . note that movie captions are provided in appendix  [ movies ] .",
    "the finding from the previous section that impact entrainment events play crucial roles during both turbulent bedload and saltation transport highlights the need for a proxy conveying information about the relevance of impact entrainment relative to fluid entrainment .",
    "here we discuss two potential proxies , which we obtain from the vertical profile of the average horizontal particle velocity @xmath0 ( for the precise definition of the notation @xmath37 , see appendix  [ techdetails]1 ) .",
    "section  [ slipvel ] discusses the standard proxy , the slip velocity @xmath17 , where the location @xmath1 of the bed surface is here defined as the effective location of high - energy particle - bed rebounds ( appendix  [ techdetails]3 ) , and why it is inappropriate for our purposes .",
    "therefore , section  [ bedvel ] proposes and quantitatively analyzes a novel proxy , the ` bed velocity ' .",
    "figure  [ velprofiles ] shows the vertical profiles of ( a ) @xmath38 and ( b ) @xmath39 relative to @xmath1 for the entire simulated range of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and a value of @xmath19 that is near the associated threshold @xmath40 , where @xmath11 is the value of @xmath6 reduced by the buoyancy and added - mass force .",
    "it can be seen that there is a very rough tendency of @xmath38 , but not of @xmath39 , to collapse near @xmath1 when the impact number @xmath41 ( open symbols ) . in the aeolian research community",
    ", a constant value of @xmath42 is thought to be evidence that saltation transport is a fully impact - sustained transport regime because it is associated with a constant average outcome of particle - bed impacts @xcite .",
    "in fact , when impact entrainment dominates fluid entrainment , every particle trapped at the bed must be replaced by precisely one particle entrained through impacts on average",
    ". however , this line of reasoning is not entirely accurate because it indirectly assumes that all particle - bed impacts occur at the same vertical location @xmath1 .",
    "however , particle - bed impacts actually occur at varying vertical locations and their range of influence often involves several layers of the sediment bed ( e.g. , see movie  s3 ) , which makes this assumption problematic because @xmath0 increases exponentially with @xmath43 near @xmath1 ( fig .  [ velprofiles]a ) , meaning small changes of @xmath43 have large effect . indeed ,",
    "[ slipvelocity]a shows that the slip velocity exhibits significant fluctuations with @xmath44 and thus with @xmath19 even for typical saltation transport conditions in earth s atmosphere ( e.g. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) . note that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fluid shear velocity , is the viscous , horizontal near - bed fluid velocity in natural units ( @xmath49 ) .    in the aeolian research community",
    ", it is the current consensus point of view that experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ) show an approximately constant slip velocity for saltation transport @xcite , which would contradict our numerical finding if true .",
    "however , what the experiments truly show is instead that the _ extrapolation _ of @xmath0 from vertical locations @xmath50 mm to @xmath1 is approximately constant .",
    "in fact , reliable measurements of @xmath51 do not exist for vertical locations @xmath52 mm because large particle concentrations near @xmath1 strongly disturb the measurement apparatuses @xcite , which is supported by the fact that the few actual measurements ( i.e. , non - extrapolations ) of @xmath51 reported for that region @xcite vary by more than an order of magnitude between about @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 @xcite . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ velprofiles]a , the data for @xmath50 mm , where our simulations are consistent with measurements , suggest a linear trend of @xmath0 with @xmath43 even though the actual trend for @xmath52 mm is much closer to an exponential behavior . it explains why the extrapolation of @xmath0 to @xmath1 yields values very different from the actual slip velocity",
    "indeed , when we estimate the slip velocity from our transport simulations via linear extrapolation , we obtain values that are perfectly consistent with the likewise extrapolated measurements ( inset of fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]a ) .",
    "though the extrapolation of @xmath51 to @xmath1 might serve as a proxy for the relative relevance of impact entrainment for saltation transport in earth s atmosphere , which is characterized by a large transport layer , it is obviously meaningless for transport regimes with a small transport layer , such as bedload transport , and thus does not allow a unified treatment of all transport regimes . in what follows , we therefore propose a novel proxy .",
    "as explained above , the main issue with the slip velocity proxy is the fact that particle - bed impacts occur at varying vertical locations and their range of influence often involves several layers of the sediment bed .",
    "a straightforward way to mend this issue is to average @xmath0 around @xmath1 rather than evaluate it at @xmath1 .",
    "the averaging method we apply here is rather complex and explained in detail in appendix  [ techdetails]4 .",
    "it results in what we call the ` bed velocity ' @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ slipvelocity]b shows that @xmath55 is a much better proxy than @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]a ) as it reproduces the approximately constant behavior expected for saltation transport in earth s atmosphere .",
    "in detail , we observe two extreme regimes .",
    "when sediment transport is fully sustained through fluid entrainment , the bed velocity scales with the average near - bed fluid velocity ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]b ) .",
    "in contrast , when sediment transport is fully sustained through impact entrainment , the dimensionless bed velocity is approximately constant , @xmath56 , and changes comparably little with @xmath19 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "a part of the variation of @xmath55 in this regime can be attributed to small changes of the bed friction coefficient @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is particle - shear - pressure ration ( appendix  [ techdetails]2 and [ techdetails]3 ) . in fact , we find that assuming @xmath59 for fully impact - sustained conditions results in a significantly improved data collapse ( fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]c ) , which makes sense because once can expect that impact entrainment is the more difficult ( larger @xmath55 ) the larger the granular resistance at the bed surface ( larger @xmath60 ) .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]c corresponds to fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity]b when setting @xmath61 .",
    "the transition to a fully impact - sustained transport regime is determined by two independent conditions .",
    "first , the impact number has to exceed a critical value : @xmath41 ( fig .  [ slipvelocity ] , open symbols ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the transport - layer average @xmath18 of the horizontal particle velocity ( defined in appendix  [ techdetails]6 ) must be larger than the bed velocity since @xmath0 increases with @xmath43 .",
    "for relatively viscous conditions at grain scale ( @xmath62 ) and close to the transport threshold ( @xmath63 ) , the scaling of the average particle velocity @xmath18 can be obtained from the proportionality of @xmath18 with the transport - layer average fluid velocity @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ meanvelocity ] ) and a dynamic - friction condition ( i.e. , @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath66 and the condition @xmath67 implies @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the second condition for fully impact - sustained transport is @xmath70 and follows from the proportionality of the dimensionless bed velocity with the dimensionless near - bed fluid velocity in the fully fluid - sustained regime ( @xmath71 ) and the fact that @xmath55 can not increase indefinitely ( figs .",
    "[ slipvelocity]b , c ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath72 , which exclusively characterizes viscous bedload transport conditions , increasing the shields parameter leads to a transition from fully fluid - sustained when @xmath15 to fully impact - sustained transport when @xmath13 as the increasing bed velocity reaches the maximum value needed to replace every particle trapped at the bed by exactly one particle entrained through impacts ( inset of figs .",
    "[ slipvelocity]b , c ) . note that , near the threshold , the condition @xmath73 always implies @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath74 @xcite ) , but not vice versa ( e.g. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 in figs .",
    "[ slipvelocity]b , c ) , and the condition @xmath75 always implies @xmath15 .",

    "inset : dimensionless transport - layer - averaged horizontal particle velocity @xmath78 and bed velocity @xmath55 versus @xmath19 . ]",
    "it is commonly argued that the average horizontal particle velocity @xmath18 in the fully impact - sustained regime is constant @xcite or nearly constant @xcite , and that the sediment transport rate therefore approximately scales as @xmath79 , because the slip velocity is constant . in light of our finding of a generally non - constant slip velocity , but constant bed velocity @xmath9 in the fully impact - sustained regime ( fig .",
    "[ slipvelocity ] ) , one should actually rephrase this argument and say that @xmath18 is constant because the bed velocity @xmath9 is constant in this regime . however , even when rephrased , we find this argument is not valid for fully impact - sustained bedload transport ( fig .  [ bedloadtransport ] ) .",
    "although @xmath21 is , indeed , linear in @xmath19 when @xmath80 , it transforms into a @xmath81-dependency when @xmath82 . as a consequence ,",
    "the scaling @xmath83 , which is consistent with measurements of the bedload transport rate @xcite , provides a much better overall fit to the simulations .",
    "the transition from a linear to a non - linear transport law for turbulent bedload transport is consistent with a transition from a constant average particle velocity ( @xmath18 ) to one that increases with @xmath19 , which occurs even though @xmath9 remains nearly constant ( inset of fig .",
    "[ bedloadtransport ] ) . a similar transition in @xmath84",
    "can be found for some other fully impact - sustained conditions ( fig .",
    "[ softbed]b ) and a similar lack of correlation of @xmath18 with @xmath9 for all fully impact - sustained conditions ( fig .",
    "[ vx_vs_vb]a ) .",
    "also the classical slip velocity @xmath17 usually does not correlate with @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ vx_vs_vb]b ) with the exception of bedload transport conditions ( fig .  [ vx_vs_vb]c ) .    rather than with the bed velocity , the horizontal particle velocity scales with the horizontal fluid velocity ( fig .",
    "[ meanvelocity ] ) . in detail",
    ", we find that the scaling of @xmath18 depends on the relation between @xmath18 and the size of the transport layer ( @xmath85 ) . when the transport layer is within the viscous sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer ( @xmath86 , with the viscous length @xmath87 $ ] ) , @xmath18 scales with the characteristic fluid velocity within the viscous sublayer : @xmath88 , where @xmath64 scales as @xmath89 when the particle - flow feedback ( see below ) can be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "when the transport layer extends beyond the viscous sublayer , the scale of the particle velocity is dominated by the characteristic fluid velocity in the logarithmic region of the velocity profile .",
    "that is , @xmath90 when the particle - flow feedback can be neglected .",
    "however , for saltation transport in earth s atmosphere ( @xmath45 , @xmath91 ) , it is well - known that there is a strong negative feedback on the flow generated by particle motion @xcite , which is a necessary condition to maintain a constant average impact velocity @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the fluid shear velocity remains approximately constant with @xmath19 in an extended region above the bed surface , and the particle velocity scales as @xmath92 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ meanvelocity ] ) , resulting in a linear scaling of @xmath21 with @xmath19 , consistent with measurements @xcite .",
    "we propose that the same negative feedback keeps a constant average particle velocity , at least close enough to the threshold , in all fully impact - sustained regimes ( inset of fig .",
    "[ meanvelocity ] ) , including turbulent bedload transport . however , the simulations suggest that , at sufficiently large fluid shear stresses ( @xmath93 for turbulent bedload transport ) , a highly collisional layer of transported particles ( a liquid - like or ` soft ' bed @xcite ) develops because the bed surface becomes completely mobile ( ` stage-3 ' bedload transport @xcite , movie  s4 ) .",
    "this liquid - like bed hinders particles moving over it from reaching the disturbed - flow region near the quasi - static - bed surface as they tend to rebound from the liquid - bed surface ( movie  s4 ) .",
    "hence , these particles can remain extended periods of time in the nearly - undisturbed - flow region , leading to an increase of @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "this point is further supported by fig .",
    "[ softbed]a , which shows that , for fully impact - sustained conditions , the beginning increase of @xmath18 ( fig .",

    "we have shown that the average horizontal near - bed particle velocity ( ` bed velocity ' ) in natural units ( @xmath55 ) becomes a universal constant when the ` impact number ' @xmath12 or @xmath73 ( figs .",
