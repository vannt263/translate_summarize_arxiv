    "the kuramoto model was originally introduced by yoshiki kuramoto as a mathematically tractable way of explaining the synchronization observed in biological systems @xcite . the model and its various modifications , however , are generic , in the sense that they do not start with biological or physical first principles .",
    "instead , they represent a type of `` normal form '' , a prototypical model system that captures the mathematical essence of the phenomenon .",
    "consequently , they do not aim to directly describe the details of any real physical or biological systems or processes . nonetheless , these phase models have had remarkable success as effective models of synchronization phenomena in a diverse range of contexts  @xcite .",
    "the literature is replete with theoretical and numerical predictions for synchronizing nonlinear oscillators ( see , for instance , the book of  @xcite for a relevant summary ) .",
    "these predictions are almost always written in non - dimensionalized forms , but for many experimental systems , equations from first principles do not easily transform into such canonical non - dimensionalized equations . establishing such a connection , however , between the experimental parameters and the coefficients in the canonical equations , can be quite powerful , as it provides a wealth of predictive power for the particular experimental system , given the breadth and depth of associated theoretical analysis and also the amenability of such systems to computational studies . here , we will attempt to establish such a connection between experiments , numerical computations ( both direct dynamics and bifurcation - type analysis ) and analytical theory ( based on multiple time scales analysis ) for a nonlinear electrical circuit system .    in this paper , more specifically",
    ", we derive the connection from component - level system specifications to the canonical phase and amplitude equations for wien - bridge electronic self - oscillators . in a small number of other systems , such as coupled josephson arrays @xcite and mechanical oscillators @xcite , it has been possible to mathematically derive the effective phase model starting from basic principles .",
    "such scientifically relevant systems , however , seem to be quite rare in the literature . in these cases ,",
    "a kuramoto - like model emerges after a procedure that suitably averages out the fast time dynamics . in this paper , too , we use a similar idea to bridge the two seemingly disparate levels of description - the description at the level of the op - amps in terms of voltages and currents , and the higher - level description in terms of oscillator phases and amplitudes .",
    "we analyze the behavior of two coupled weakly nonlinear oscillators .",
    "the slow dynamics obtained using the method of multiple - time scales can be separated into amplitude and phase dynamics .",
    "when the amplitudes are constant , the system reduces to a case example of the phase dynamics within the well - studied kuramoto - sakaguchi model @xcite , and we can make specific predictions for parameters appearing in that model in terms of circuit component values .",
    "we also investigate the dynamics when the amplitudes are not assumed constant and obtain systems similar in form to those rigorously studied by aronson _",
    "et al . _",
    "we further generalize the equations by examining the case where the two oscillators are comprised of circuit element of non - identical values .",
    "finally , in all of these cases , we compare the theoretical predictions to experimental measurements on a pair of coupled wien - bridge oscillators . we find good agreement in the parametric regimes where the reduction is expected to be valid ( and discuss the relevant deviations when it is not ) .",
    "a previous study  @xcite found experimentally that the dynamics of high - gain wien - bridge oscillators was described quite well by the kuramoto - sakaguchi phase model . in this paper",
    "we focus on weakly nonlinear oscillators , in contrast to strongly nonlinear oscillators studied there .",
    "we also explore the synchronization dynamics from a bifurcation theory perspective and identify the potential of the model for spontaneous symmetry breaking features ( even though we identify the latter as unstable ) .",
    "although the weakly nonlinear oscillators are nearly simple harmonic oscillators , their coupled behavior is not well described as a pair of harmonic oscillators ; the latter description is inadequate to characterize the dynamical features we observe . though small , the nonlinear terms stabilizing the oscillator amplitudes lead to behavior on two different time scales , the fast oscillation rate and the slow coupled amplitude dynamics .",
    "the method of multiple - time scales systematically decouples the analysis of the two time scales , and provides the crucial connection between the component - level description of the oscillators and the effective phase / amplitude reduction model .",
    "the latter provides the path to the synchronization and spontaneous symmetry breaking features observed and paves the way towards the analysis at the lattice level of a large number of associated oscillators . for completeness , but also given the interest of the latter theme in its own right , we also consider the more technically challenging ( as regards the derivation of the slow dynamics ) scenario of two non - identical oscillators",
    ".    our presentation will be structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will start from the first principles of the electrical circuit system of interest and will derive the amplitude / phase effective model via multiple scales analysis . in section iii , we will obtain theoretical and numerical conclusions on the basis of the latter model , which then in section iv will be compared to the direct physical experiments . finally , section v summarizes our findings and presents our conclusions , as well as some directions for potential future work .",
    "technical details of the multiple scale analysis can be found in the appendix .",
    "our first - principles derivation will begin with basic circuit equations under the assumption of ideal circuit elements .",
    "the mid - point of our calculation will be a pair of coupled second - order differential equations describing the dynamics of the op - amps input voltages in terms of component values and input voltages .",
    "from there , the multiple - scale analysis will lead to four coupled first - order differential equations describing the dynamics in terms of amplitude and phase of the pair of coupled oscillators under consideration .",

    "the top oscillator is shown with all of its necessary components .",
    "we see the non - inverting amplifier loop involving the negative terminal of the op - amp .",
    "note that in an actual wien - bridge oscillator we also need some nonlinear circuit element to stabilize the oscillations .",
    "one easy way to incorporate this aspect is to make @xmath0 slightly voltage - dependent , such that for large voltages , @xmath0 would be reduced . in previous experiments , a diode pair in parallel with @xmath0 is used to accomplish this @xcite , and we will take that approach in the analyses and experiments presented here .",
    "the circuit diagram also features positive feedback ( from the op - amp output to the positive input channel ) via an rc bandpass filter .",
    "this filter consists of a resistor , @xmath1 , and capacitor in series , followed by a resistor and capacitor in parallel to ground .",
    "we have highlighted in the figure some notation that we will use in the derivation of the circuit equations .",
    "for instance , the voltages are labeled at particularly important junctions , such as the output terminals of the op - amps , denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for oscillators 1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : almost_main ] ) needs to be replaced with an expression involving the input voltage . to obtain this , consider the non - inverting amplifier block of oscillator 1 , the portion involving the resistors @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for ideal op - amps , the current entering the inverting input of the op - amp is negligible .",
    "furthermore , the op - amp is in a negative feedback configuration , ensuring that the non - inverting and inverting inputs will be maintained at essentially the same voltage , @xmath6 . as such , @xmath2 and @xmath6",
    "are related via , @xmath18 recall that @xmath0 will need to be nonlinear for stable oscillations , and that the circuit involves diodes wired in parallel with @xmath0 . for voltages near the diode threshold ,",
    "the diodes allow current to bypass @xmath16 ; equivalently , the resistance of @xmath16 drops for large voltages . to first order in small quantities",

    "however , to first order in small quantities , this merely results in a redefinition of @xmath20 .",
    "] , we can approximate this effect as @xmath21 the resistance should be an even function of voltage ( or current ) , and so eq.([nonlin ] ) could also be thought of as the first two terms in a taylor expansion .",
    "similarly , it is clear that @xmath22 is positive .",
    "the value of @xmath20 could in principle be calculated using the shockley diode equation @xcite , but for our purposes we will simply assume it is a small positive number .",
    "it then follows that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the resistence of the actual resistor component in the circuit .",
    "this approximation is valid in the weakly nonlinear regime , which means the current bypassing the resistor via the diodes must be small",
    ". the same equation will also govern @xmath3 .    substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ eq : almost_main ] ) to eliminate @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we finally obtain the following second - order differential equation for oscillator 1 : @xmath25 this can be simplified by introducing a number of parameters denoting dimensionless time and important ratios : @xmath26 here we have made the notational implicit assumption that @xmath27 , i.e. the coupling is weak .",
    "our definition for @xmath28 is motivated by the requirement for stable oscillations ( for a single oscillator ) , namely that the op - amp gain should be slightly larger than 3 .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq : governing - eqs ] ) can be simulated directly , of course , but first we choose a different approach , since the larger goal is to establish a mathematical connection with the kuramoto - sakaguchi model and to use the latter for a series of quantitative conclusions about our system .",
    "such models describe the dynamics in terms of oscillator phases , as well as possibly oscillator amplitudes . in the original kuramoto model ,",
    "the phases evolve according to the natural frequencies of the oscillators which are modulated by phase interaction terms whose strength is given by the coupling parameter .",
    "thus , the typical problem has two time scales : a fast dynamics governed by the natural oscillator frequencies , and a slower dynamics representing the phase interactions between the coupled oscillators .",

    "[ data2 ] : larger coupling produces larger oscillation amplitudes , which in turn means that the diode corrections become more prominent .",
    "interestingly , both the theory and experiment indicate that the phase boundary depends upon the gain . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the minimum difference in natural frequency ( @xmath146 ) necessary to break the synchronized state is much larger than for @xmath122 , and this trend continues for @xmath147 ( not shown ) .",
    "a smaller gain setting ( on both oscillators ) has the effect of favoring oscillator synchronization .",
    "we have shown that two coupled low - gain wien - bridge oscillators can be modeled as a pair of amplitude oscillators with kuramoto - sakaguchi - like phase coupling .",
    "the equations describing the amplitude and phase dynamics can be derived by applying the method of multiple time scales to the first - principles circuit equations describing the dynamics of voltages and currents in the circuit , and they can be considered a generalization of the phase - oscillator kuramoto - sakaguchi model .",
    "simulations indicate that the model s predictions for steady - state behavior agree with the underlying circuit equations . to our knowledge",
    ", such a derivation of an amplitude oscillator model from basic physical laws has only been fully accomplished in very limited classes of systems , more specifically two for coupled mechanical oscillators and another in the context of josephson arrays .",
    "a recent study @xcite found experimental evidence that electronic self - oscillators were well described by the kuramoto - sakaguchi model .",
    "while this work does not formally extend to the high - gain regime explored in that study , the analysis does suggest that the experimental findings therein are not unexpected .",
    "the amplitude / phase equations admit a number of interesting stationary states , most of which are unstable .",
    "when we assume that the oscillators are identical , the variety of stationary states include equal - amplitude synchronized and anti - synchronized states , as well as and symmetry - broken states of unequal amplitudes .",
    "only the synchronized state featuring constant amplitudes is stable . in this state ,",
    "the amplitude / phase equations effectively reduce to the kuramoto - sakaguchi model with a phase - delay parameter of @xmath148 .",
    "when we assume that the oscillators have different frequencies , unsynchronized behavior emerges as a possibility , and we numerically find the boundary between these two states . focusing on stable steady - state behavior , we obtain a number of measurable predictions for our oscillators .",
    "some of the salient features of the theory and numerical computation are directly compared to experimental data .",
    "predictions for phase velocity are very good and predictions for the boundary between the synchronized and unsynchronized state are decent .",
    "the steady - state amplitude shows the limitations in our method .",
    "overall the amplitude / phase equations shed light on a wide variety of behavior for our oscillators .",
    "having systematically analyzed the case of the pair paves the way for numerous future studies .",
    "on the one hand , the methodology developed for this `` dimer '' can be generalized to `` oligomer '' settings involving a few oscillators , e.g. , trimers  @xcite , quadrimers  @xcite etc .",
    "another direction is that of extending the present phenomenology to a full lattice and trying to examine how the synchronization , phase drifting or symmetry breaking ( in the latter setting perhaps manifested via localization ) features arise .",
    "such studies are currently under consideration and will be reported in future publications .",
