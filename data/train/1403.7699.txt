    "further information on asteroid physical properties are available only for select objects with relatively large sizes , which make up only a fraction of the whole asteroid population .",
    "such properties include , but are not limited to , the bulk density , @xmath13 , thermal inertia , @xmath14 , and the obliquity , @xmath15 , all of which affect non - gravitational forces that act upon the body and alter its orbit compared to a keplerian one .",
    "two important effects are the yarkovsky effect ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solar radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the bulk density , @xmath13 , provides the simplest way of gaining insight into asteroid interiors . solid rock , or monolithic ,",
    "bodies have high bulk densities ( @xmath16  g  @xmath3 ) , whereas those of rubble - pile bodies , aggregates of smaller particles that are consolidated by their self - gravity or other adhesive forces @xcite , can be significantly lower as a result of `` macroporosity . ''",

    "@xcite found that most asteroids show a significant degree of macroporosity , in support of the hypothesis that most asteroids must have been disrupted in the course of high - velocity impacts over the age of the solar system @xcite .",
    "small asteroids are generally thought of as being individual pieces of compact debris that were generated in disruptive collisions @xcite ; hence , their macroporosity is expected to be low and their bulk density high compared to that of rubble pile asteroids .    thermal inertia , @xmath14 , describes the ability of the surface material to store thermal energy : high - thermal - inertia material heats up slowly and re - emits the thermal energy only gradually , whereas low - thermal - inertia material can be approximated as being in instantaneous thermal equilibrium with the incoming insolation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we find a mean discrepancy between the _ spitzer _ pointing and the orbital predictions of @xmath80  in right ascension and @xmath81  in declination .",
    "this small discrepancy is readily explained by the fact that the predictions are based on a more recent _ spitzer _",

    "so far we have shown that the searched position matches the predicted position , but to have confidence in the non - detection analysis we must also show that 2009  bd was in fact close to the predicted position . to this end",
    "we compared our nominal plane - of - sky predictions from jpl solution 41 to the results of various alternate orbital solutions , e.g. , taking into account @xmath82 only , both @xmath82 and @xmath83 , gravitational effects only , and different outlier rejection schemes @xcite , with the result that 2009  bd was always near the nominal prediction .",

    "we conclude that 2009  bd could not be even @xmath84 from its predicted position .      by combining the orbital and the thermophysical model we are able to constrain a variety of physical properties of 2009  bd by taking advantage of the mutual dependencies of the individual properties . the range of each physical property is confined based on purely physical considerations .",

    "we are able to confine the diameter to such a narrow range due to constraints given by the physics of the orbital model and the upper - limit flux density derived from our observations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a diameter lower than 2.6  m implies a high bond albedo , which in turn reduces the size of the yarkovsky effect and prevents our model from matching the magnitude of the observed acceleration .",
    "the advantage of this definition of the lower limit is that we do not _ apriori _ rule out the possibility that 2009  bd has an extremely high albedo , which is the case for the low-@xmath14 solution .",

    "due to ambiguities in the identification of the asteroidal origin of meteoritic material , we use average bulk densities derived from meteoritic material as proxies for asteroidal bulk densities of individual taxonomic types .",

    "the lower thermal inertia of large bodies is generally ascribed to the presence of a thick layer of regolith , which has a low thermal inertia ( see section [ lbl : introduction ] , as well as * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : physical_properties ] plots thermal inertia measurements of asteroids with @xmath154  km .",
    "the plot reveals that 2009  bd s thermal inertia is extreme in this range , irrespective of which of our solutions better describes reality .",
    "the low-@xmath14 solution is consistent with the presence of regolith , whereas the high-@xmath14 solution is consistent with a bare - rock nature of 2009  bd .",
    "a slight trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing diameter is visible in figure [ fig : physical_properties ] , which was already discussed by @xcite .",
    "our high-@xmath14 solution seems to be more consistent with this trend , presuming that this trend is valid for asteroids in the size regime of 2009  bd .",
    "we summarize the properties of 2009  bd created by our two solutions in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the low-@xmath14 solution suggests that 2009  bd is a @xmath155  m sized rocky body ( @xmath156  g  @xmath3 ) that is covered with a physically thin but optically thick layer of regolith - like material , causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia ( @xmath157  si units ) and a high bulk density .",
    "this picture seems realistic in the sense that models show that even small asteroids can retain a layer of fine - grained dust on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "the picture created by the high-@xmath14 solutions shows 2009  bd as a 4  m - sized rubble - pile asteroid ( @xmath158  g  @xmath3 ) that consists of individual bare rock slabs ( @xmath159  si units ) and exhibits a macroporosity of 45% .",
    "this scenario seems to be more realistic due to the lower albedo that is required for this configuration .",
    "despite the fact that some properties seem to favor one of the two results at a time , we are unable to rule out either of the configurations based on physical reasoning . in order to be able to commit to either solution , additional observations are necessary that are able to pinpoint one decisive physical property of 2009  bd , e.g. , its thermal inertia or its bulk density .",
    "the thermal inertia can be further constrained using additional infrared observations or using in - situ measurements .",
    "the bulk density can be independently derived by measuring the gravitational attraction of the object on a nearby body or a rendezvous spacecraft .",
    "the probabilistic approach taken in this work to constrain the physical properties of 2009  bd is unique .",
    "we have to acknowledge that a full validation of the methods presented in this paper is not yet possible .",
    "2009  bd is currently the only asteroid for which both the yarkovsky and solar radiation pressure forces can be measured from astrometric observations , which are used here to constrain the object s bulk density and thermal inertia .",
    "an independent validation of our modeling approach would require an asteroid with non - gravitational perturbations and physical model independently characterized .",
    "the first object for which such a wealth of data is anticipated will be neo ( 101955 ) bennu , the osiris - rex mission target .    instead , we note that both the thermophysical and the dynamical models are individually well - tested .",
    "the thermophysical model used in this work is based on and has been extensively tested against the model discussed by @xcite , which was applied in a number of publications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model of the yarkovsky forces is based on work done by @xcite , which is used to describe the yarkovsky effect observed in a number of objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , the solar radiation pressure model @xcite was used to refine orbits of small asteroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that in all previous works in which either model has been used , the resulting physical properties are within reasonable ranges .",
    "both the orbital and the thermophysical model assume a spherical shape of 2009  bd .",
    "@xcite have shown that using the real shape of ( 101955 ) bennu , instead of assuming a spherical shape , lowers the thermal inertia of that object by a factor of 2 .",
    "the case of bennu shows that shape information can impact the physical parameter results .",
    "we investigate the possible impact of an irregular shape on our results .",
    "2009  bd has a rotation period @xmath51  hrs @xcite with a lightcurve magnitude of @xmath160  mag ( b. ryan , private communication 2014 ) , which suggests an elongation @xmath161 for a triaxial ellipsoid with relative dimensions ( @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "assuming a rotation period @xmath164  hrs , any elongation effects are averaged out during our 25  hrs integration , leading to physical properties of a volume - equivalent sphere .",
    "we further investigate the effect of a possible flattening of 2009  bd , by assuming the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid with axes @xmath165 and @xmath166 , which is quite typical among larger asteroids .",
    "we find that the smaller cross - section of the triaxial shape compared to that of a spherical shape requires a reduction of the bulk density of 1520% to provide the observed magnitude of the solar radiation pressure force .",
    "a numerical simulation of the yarkovsky forces @xcite suggests that the thermal inertia estimates might be lower by as much as a factor of 2 , which has also been found for bennu by @xcite .",
    "the smaller thermal inertia in turn reduces the diameters found for both solutions ( see figures [ fig : d_ti_map ] and [ fig : diameter_distributions ] ) .",
    "note that the changes to the individual physical properties found as part of this simulation are mostly within the uncertainties derived assuming a spherical shape .",
    "since there is no certainty on the shape of 2009  bd we stick to the results based on a simple spherical shape , which are still valid within the uncertainties , assuming a triaxial shape .",
    "additional information on the shape of 2009  bd might require a re - assessment of our results in the future .",
    "our results show that the volume - equivalent diameter of 2009  bd , @xmath167  m ( 3@xmath64 ) , is most likely smaller than the size range aimed for in the arrm mission design ( 710  m , see above ) .",
    "however , its total mass is roughly 1/10 of the mass aimed for in the current design , reducing efforts necessary to alter the orbit of the asteroid . the final decision on 2009  bd s suitability",
    "as a mission target is beyond the scope of this work , but a potential mission to 2009  bd will be able to resolve the solution degeneracy we found for the physical properties of this object .    the two scenarios based on our data and presented in section [ lbl : discussion_properties ] show 2009  bd either as a rocky object covered with regolith - like material or a loose conglomerate of bare rocks .",
    "either scenario reveals this object as rather exotic compared to other known asteroids .",
    "hence , 2009  bd may not belong to the normal population of neos that have their origins in the main belt , accounting for its very earth - like orbit .",
    "it has been suggested that ejecta from impacts on the moon could end up in earth - like orbits ; another possibility is that 2009  bd is a man - made object @xcite .",
    "a value for @xmath11 of around 0.45 or 0.85 is much higher than the moon s albedo albedo of 0.11 @xcite , which would appear to reduce the likelihood that 2009  bd has a lunar origin .",
    "a section of a spent rocket booster would have a high albedo , but the densities derived here ( for both the low and the high-@xmath14 solutions ) are far higher than values associated with , for example , hollow rocket fuel tanks .",
    "specifically , the values of the area - to - mass ratio ( @xmath43 ) listed in table [ tbl : solutions ] , which are substantially independent of the diameter estimate , are 12 orders of magnitude less than that of artificial objects .",
    "the available astrometry contradicts area - to - mass ratios compatible with a spent booster .",
    "while our results do not appear to favor any of the more exotic origins for 2009  bd suggested by its very earth - like orbit , they emphasize the puzzling nature of this object and the need for further observations of this and similar objects .",
    "we derive two physically possible solutions for the physical properties of 2009  bd from our _ spitzer _ observations , using thermophysical modeling and modeling of the non - gravitational forces acting upon this body .",
    "the first solution shows 2009  bd as a @xmath1  m sized massive rock body ( @xmath2  g  @xmath3 ) with an extremely high albedo of @xmath168 that is covered with regolith - like material , causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia ( @xmath5  si units ) .",
    "the second solution suggests 2009  bd to be a @xmath6  m - sized rubble - pile asteroid ( @xmath169  g  @xmath3 ) with an albedo of @xmath65 that consists of individual bare rock slabs ( @xmath8  si units ) .",
    "we are unable to rule out either solution with the current knowledge .",
