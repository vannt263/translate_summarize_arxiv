    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are extraordinary events situated at the crossroads of many fields of astrophysics .",
    "they mark the birth of compact objects , either neutron stars or stellar - mass black holes which , owing to their high compactness , are often the site of tremendous magnetic fields , as in magnetars , or the site of tremendous rotation rates , as in millisecond - period pulsars .",
    "their ejecta make a significant contribution to the chemical enrichment of galaxies , while affecting their dynamics and energetics .",
    "the connection to @xmath1-ray bursts , for a subset of these sne , may turn them into excellent probes of the early universe .",
    "our focus , however , is to characterize the sn ejecta itself and extract information that can help us understand the properties of the explosion and of the progenitor star .",
    "such inferences are based on the analysis of the sn light , using photometric , spectroscopic , or spectropolarimetric data .",
    "hence , developing accurate radiative - transfer tools capturing the key physics controlling the interaction of light and matter is of prime importance . of all sne , only core - collapse , and in particular type ii sne ,",
    "have well - identified progenitors . numerous type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sne",
    "have now been associated with the explosion of low - mass red - supergiant ( rsg ) stars @xcite , while the progenitor of the type ii - peculiar sn1987a was a blue - supergiant ( bsg ) star , named sk -69 202 ( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the excellent quality of the observational data for sn1987a makes it ideal for detailed modeling .",
    "numerous radiative - transfer studies of the early - time spectra of sn1987a have been done , with some success @xcite . however , these studies are now twenty years old .",
    "they generally assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ; at best treating only a fraction of the species / levels in non - lte ) and/or steady - state for the radiative transfer , and employed small model atoms . @xcite and @xcite have emphasized the effects of line blanketing in the uv .",
    "one explicit question raised by these studies was the problematic observation of hei lines in optical spectra , which required unacceptable helium enrichments .",
    "more recently , @xcite argued for significant mixing of @xmath2ni beyond 5000 in order to reproduce balmer line profiles during the first weeks after explosion .",
    "the balmer line strength problem has now been associated with the erroneous neglect of important time - dependent terms that appear in the energy and statistical - equilibrium equations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while reproducing the characteristics of hei lines seems to require a non - lte treatment .",
    "hence , some of these discrepancies may simply reflect the shortcomings of the radiative - transfer tools employed rather than a genuine peculiarity of the progenitor . taking a new look at",
    "this dataset therefore seems warranted .",
    "furthermore , studying sn1987a is a good exercise to gauge the level of accuracy of radiative - transfer codes and assumptions , facilitated by the considerable advances in computer technology over the last twenty years .",
    "because atomic data represent a fundamental and essential ingredient of radiative - transfer computations , the considerable improvements in that domain over that period make such calculations more accurate than calculations done when sn1987a went off .    in this paper , we present a new approach for non - lte time - dependent radiative transfer modeling of sn ejecta using the code cmfgen @xcite .",
    "we discuss the conceptual aspects of the method and emphasize the key equations that are solved , delaying a more comprehensive presentation of the technical details to a forthcoming paper ( hillier & dessart 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "we illustrate this new capability with results obtained for sn1987a , starting our time evolution from an hydrodynamical input of an exploded bsg star ( woosley , priv .",
    "comm . ; model  lm18a7ad \" ) .",
    "we do not present an in - depth study of sn1987a , but merely use this well - observed sn to check and confront our model results .",
    "a preliminary set of results were presented in @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the various approaches we have used in the recent years for sn spectroscopic modeling , emphasizing their merits and limitations .",
    "we then describe in  [ sect_setup ] the hydrodynamical model we employ as a basis for this calculation , summarizing its various properties , before presenting our setup for the radiative - transfer calculation . in  [ sect_results ] , we describe the ejecta evolution , such as temperature and ionization structure , and present checks on our numerical technique .",
    "we then discuss in ",
    "[ sect_synthetic_rad ] the radiative properties of our non - lte time - dependent models , covering in turn synthetic spectra and the bolometric light curve , and detailing in particular the sources of line blanketing at various epochs . in  [ sect_comp_to_obs ] , we compare our theoretical predictions to uv and optical observations of sn1987a .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in ",
    "[ sect_ccl ] , and lay out the various projects ahead .",
    "radiative - transfer modeling of sn ejecta can be performed in a variety of ways and with different accuracies and consistencies : the interaction between the gas and the radiation may be done in lte or in non - lte ; the problem may be simplified to its steady - state form ( @xmath3 and @xmath40 ) ; the relative importance of absorption versus scattering opacity may be imposed or calculated .",
    "the latter is controlled by transition rates , level populations , and the ionization state , which are all connected to the radiation field and thus the whole problem is tightly coupled .",
    "our fundamental aim is to model the time evolution of the gas and radiation field from near the onset of the explosion ( i.e. , shock breakout in core - collapse sne ) when the ejecta are hot , dense , and possess a large optical depth , until the nebular phase when expansion and cooling have made the ejecta cool , tenuous , and optically thin at all wavelengths . to do so , we need to track the evolution of the following :    \\1 ) the specific intensity @xmath5 as a function of radius , time , frequency , and angle , i.e. , @xmath6 , as well as its moments @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "\\2 ) the properties of the gas , such as electron density @xmath10 and ion density @xmath11 , temperature , energy .",
    "this requires accounting for changes in excitation and ionization , as well as for contributions from radioactive decay of unstable isotopes .",
    "\\3 ) the coupling between the radiation and the gas , i.e. , opacity and emissivity .",
    "this represents a considerable task in sn ejecta because of departures from lte conditions and the importance of scattering .",
    "\\4 ) the changes in composition of unstable isotopes .    finally , all this work has to be done using a reliable and comprehensive atomic dataset for a wide range of species and ions .",
    "schematically , assuming homologous expansion and retaining only the terms of order @xmath12 , the combined set of equations we wish to solve are :    * the statistical equilibrium equations ( one for each level @xmath13 of each ion treated ) : + @xmath14 * the energy equation : @xmath15 * the time dependent zeroth and first moment of the radiative transfer equation : + @xmath16 + and + @xmath17 + in the above equations @xmath18 is the lagrangian derivative , @xmath19 the number density of state @xmath13 , @xmath20 is a term that represents the rates connecting the level @xmath13 to the level @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath23 the frequency , @xmath24 the opacity , @xmath25 the emissivity , @xmath26 the mean intensity , and @xmath27 is the specific energy associated with the decay of unstable nuclei . the internal energy can be written in the form + @xmath28 + where + @xmath29 + @xmath30 + @xmath31 is the total particle density ( excluding electrons ) , @xmath32 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath33 is the mean atomic weight , and @xmath34 is the total energy ( excitation and ionization ) of state @xmath13 .    in a steady - state approach ,",
    "we drop all terms involving partial - derivatives with respect to time , in the statistical - equilibrium / energy - equations and/or in the moments of the transfer equation . by neglecting these in both",
    ", the approach allows for departures from lte and assumes steady - state (  [ sect_noddt ] ) . retaining them in the first but neglecting them in the second ,",
    "one grasps the time - dependent effects important for the ionization structure , while the radiation field is still assumed steady - state (  [ sect_ddt ] ) . by retaining these terms in all equations above ,",
    "one accounts for the full time dependence of the problem and thereby reaches a much higher level of physical consistency (  [ sect_djdt ] ) .",
    "these various approaches correspond chronologically to what we have followed so far .",
    "we now present them in more details .      because type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sne , associated with the explosion of rsgs , are characterized by a massive quasi - homogeneous hydrogen - rich homologously - expanding ejectum during their photospheric phase , their photospheric properties are weakly sensitive to the details of the explosion mechanism or morphology at early times .",
    "in particular , the hydrogen - rich region of type ii - p sn ejecta seems to remain quasi - spherical even when there is strong evidence for an aspherical explosion , as revealed by the growing linear polarization of continuum photons at the end of the plateau phase @xcite .",
    "this property gives impetus to model atmosphere calculations in which multi - dimensional effects are ignored , but which include a much more accurate treatment of non - lte and line - blanketing effects ( both of which are very computationally costly ) .",
    "being free of these various uncertainties , type ii - p sne are ideal for benchmarking purposes , and we therefore focused our initial investigations on these objects .",
    "our initial perspective was to consider the photospheric layers of the sn ejecta to be just like those of a stellar atmosphere , characterized here by a homologous and fast expansion , a steep density distribution , and spherical symmetry . in this approach",
    ", we neglected the lagrangian derivative terms in the radiative - transfer , statistical - equilibrium , and energy equations and solved the radiative - transfer problem in 1d ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we get extra terms of order @xmath12 in the transfer equation which is generically referred to as the relativistic form of the transfer equation .",
    "these extra terms are unimportant in o and wolf - rayet stars , but are of crucial importance for the temperature structure in sn , particularly below the photosphere @xcite .",
    "various approximations to the transfer equation have been suggested to avoid the explicit - time dependence in the transfer equation , but these are ultimately unphysical .",
    "@xcite concluded `` that a fully time - dependent solution to the transport problem is needed in order to compute sne ia light curves and spectra accurate enough to distinguish subtle differences of various explosion models '' , and we believe the same must be true for type ii sne . ]",
    "observed spectra are computed in the observer s frame using the code of @xcite , with relativistic terms taken into account but ignoring time dependence ( see hillier & dessart 2010 for details ) .",
    "the radiative - transfer grid is set to cover the vicinity of the photospheric region , extending inwards to a rosseland mean optical depth of @xmath0100 and extending outwards to distances where radiation is in a free - streaming regime . in between the boundaries",
    ", we adopt an analytical distribution for the sn ejecta density .",
    "we impose a uniform composition ( i.e. , the modeled ejecta layers are chemically homogeneous ) , so that changes in ion densities reflect exclusively changes in ionization .",
    "the temperature structure of the ejecta is controlled through the imposed diffusive inner boundary flux and constrained through fits to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as well as line profile strength and shape .",
    "an independently inferred distance to the galaxy host and/or the estimated time of explosion allow one to approximate the radius at a given epoch , thereby fully constraining the problem .",
    "equipped with the assumptions outlined above , we analyzed the photospheric phase of sne 1999em , 2005cs , and 2006bp @xcite .",
    "we discussed the importance of line blanketing on the sed , the importance of non - lte effects for line formation , and the importance of line overlap for proper identifications of spectral features .",
    "we found that at early times , prior to the ejecta recombining to a neutral state , our approximations produced very satisfactory fits to observations , with ejecta properties compatible with the rsg nature of the progenitor star . based on these quantitative analyzes , we also determined distances to these sne , obtaining values in agreement with those obtained with independent methods ( e.g. , cepheids ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is self - contained , so that one can compute a model without considering the previous evolution or the ejecta conditions below the inner grid boundary . but",
    "this approach becomes inaccurate when the time - dependent terms appearing in the equations above become non - negligible , or when the inner boundary flux can not be accurately described by a steady - state diffusion solution .",
    "the steady - state assumption is a simplification of the radiative transfer problem , one that holds safely in the context of hot star atmospheres for which cmfgen was originally designed .",
    "however , in sne , low density and fast expansion conspire to make the expansion and the recombination timescales eventually comparable . exacerbated further by optical - depth effects",
    ", time dependence can lead to an ejecta ionization freeze - out , modifying the electron and ion densities , line and continuum optical depths , and consequently the emergent flux globally .",
    "this was demonstrated by @xcite in the case of sn 1987a , with primary focus on h@xmath35 and baii6142 . by retaining the time - dependent terms in the statistical equilibrium and energy equations in cmfgen ( while keeping the same approach otherwise ) , we confirmed and generalized the strong time - dependent effects on type ii sn ejecta ionization , and extended the implications to the entire spectrum , including continuum and lines @xcite .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated the importance of these time - dependent terms for reproducing the strength and shape of balmer line profiles , although we emphasized that all lines and all ions are to some extent affected . even at early times",
    "when hydrogen is fully ionized , time - dependent effects on the helium ionization are noticeable , leading to stronger and broader hei lines compared to equivalent steady - state models .",
    "while such important time - dependent terms were included in @xcite , the approach focused only on a portion of the sn ejecta , characterized by a prescribed density distribution and chemical homogeneity , with an imposed flux at the inner , diffusive , boundary . while suitable for general studies of the radiative - transfer problem , and in particular for gauging the importance of time dependence on the ejecta ionization structure , this setup is not very amenable for comparing models with observations , or for assessing the adequacy of a given explosion model .",
    "the recent improvements to the code retain all the assets of the previous version , namely non - lte and time dependence in the statistical - equilibrium and energy equations .",
    "however , in addition to the derivatives with respect to space , angle , and frequency , we now treat time derivatives of the moments of the mean intensity that control the transport of radiation through the ejecta . for simplicity ,",
    "we still ignore time derivatives of the specific intensity .",
    "importantly , rather than focusing merely on a portion of the ejecta , we start from hydrodynamical inputs describing a given explosion and we map the _ entire ejecta _ onto the radiative - transfer grid .",
    "we then follow explicitly the evolution of both the radiation and the gas at all depths . hence ,",
    "with such a `` full - ejecta '' approach , we now retain all time- , depth- , angle- , and frequency - dependent terms in the radiative - transfer equations , the energy equation , and the statistical - equilibrium equations .",
    "importantly , this approach will allow us to model the full non - lte spectral evolution as a function of time , which in turn will allow us to accurately model the flux and color evolution of the hydrodynamical model of the sn .",
    "the treatment of boundaries is more straightforward in this approach .",
    "the outer boundary is positioned at large distances ( corresponding to a maximum velocity as high as @xmath060000 ) , where the radiation is freely streaming at all wavelengths apart from , perhaps , the hei ",
    "heii continua - this matters little since few ( if any ) photons are injected at such wavelengths at any time .",
    "the inner boundary flux is constrained by imposing a zero - flux condition .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation when the entire envelope is optically thick  it ignores effects due to doppler shifts at the inner boundary and the finite light travel time . at later times",
    "we use a a nebular approximation ( the incoming and outgoing specific intensities are equal , modulo doppler shifts which we correct for ) .",
    "diffusive energy emerging from large optical depths as time proceeds is naturally taken into account .",
    "the parameters describing the model are entirely determined at the first time step , and we just let the ejecta evolve under the various conservation laws for level - population rates , charge and gas / radiation energy .",
    "this is primarily an initial - value problem , with straightforward boundary conditions at spatial boundaries .",
    "full details of the solution technique , and approximations , will be provided by hillier & dessart ( 2010 , in preparation ) .    using a hydrodynamical model as input for our radiative - transfer calculations represents a big improvement over our former approaches , which required the setting of all ejecta conditions ( density , radius , velocity and boundary conditions ) .",
    "the past freedom allowed the tuning of model parameters but lacked physical consistency .",
    "although it will now be harder to fit a given observation , this new approach allows a more direct confrontation of synthetic observables with ejecta and progenitor properties , providing constraints on the progenitor star and its pre - sn evolution , and the characteristics of the explosion .    to track composition changes with depth , we allow for a depth - dependent composition .",
    "in addition , we follow the change in composition and the associated energy release following the decay of unstable nuclei .",
    "since most explosion models give @xmath2ni as the most significant radioactive species , we follow only one decay chain .",
    "we assume either pure local energy deposition or solve for the non - local deposition using a monte - carlo approach for @xmath1-ray transport ( this code will be presented in a separate paper ) . in the present calculations on the early - time evolution of sn 1987a , the typical @xmath1-ray photon",
    "mean - free path is much smaller than the scale of the ejecta so that the energy deposition is purely local .    in the following section ,",
    "we illustrate the results from our non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer modeling for sn1987a , based on the model `` lm18a7ad '' ( woosley , priv .",
    "comm . ) . with our approach",
    ", we can now compute both spectra and light curves in full non - lte and allow for time dependence , with explicit account of line blanketing .",
    "such an approach has never been followed in the past and constitutes a key asset of our work . in the present paper ,",
    "we wish to highlight the key properties of the sn1987a ejecta and show the match of our synthetic spectra to those observed .",
    "aiming at validating our code against the excellent observations of sn1987a , we do not address specifically the issues concerning the explosion , the ejecta geometry , or the progenitor identity of sn1987a .",
    "such an in - depth study will be performed later , allowing for variations in the properties of the progenitor and of the explosion , and gauging the impact on observables .",
    "the hydrodynamical model we use for the calculations presented in this paper was produced in two steps by stan woosley ( priv .",
    "comm . ) , using the code kepler @xcite .",
    "first , an 18 star on the main sequence was evolved with allowance for rotation , magnetic torques , and mass loss .",
    "the angular momentum halfway through hydrogen - core burning on the main sequence is 2.9@xmath3610@xmath37erg@xmath38s . at the stellar surface ,",
    "the rotation speed at that time is 240on the equator , which corresponds to @xmath033% of the local keplerian ( critical ) velocity .",
    "an lmc metallicity @xmath39 was adopted , with @xmath40 .",
    "no convective overshooting was used , but a modest semiconvection was allowed for .    at the onset of collapse ,",
    "the star is a blue - supergiant ( bsg ) with a radius of 3.28@xmath3610@xmath41 cm ( @xmath047 ) , a luminosity of 8@xmath3610@xmath42erg ( @xmath02.1@xmath3610@xmath43 ) , an effective temperature of 18000k , and has an age of 14.7myr .",
    "the pre - sn envelope above a mass cut of 1.47 ( the proto - neutron star which forms a pulsar with a rotational period of @xmath012ms ) is then exploded with a piston .",
    "its trajectory is characterized so that it yields an ejecta mass of 15.45with an asymptotic kinetic energy of 1.2@xmath3610@xmath44erg ( for details , see  2.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the ejecta composition we inherit , when we start our radiative - transfer computations , is given in table  [ tab_comp ] , while the distribution of the species with mass and velocity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_87a_prog ] .",
    "the model provided did not include a comprehensive description of isotopes , and lacked some elements with low abundances ( e.g. , sodium ) .",
    "for these , we adopted the corresponding lmc - metallicity value ( given by scaling the solar metallicity value by 0.4 ) and set it to be constant with depth ( we expect an abundance variation at the photosphere as it recedes in the ejecta towards deeper mass shells , but not over the @xmath021 days covered by our time sequence so this expedient should be adequate ) . in practice",
    ", we use a depth - independent mass fraction of 1.35@xmath3610@xmath45 for sodium .",
    "similarly , although @xmath46ti is present and quite abundant at depth in the ejecta , it is absent at the surface and so we enforce a floor value of 1.32@xmath3610@xmath47 for titanium to reflect the lmc metallicity value for that species .",
    "barium and scandium , which are both strongly under - abundant , are ignored in this first set of simulations , and hence their associated line features are absent from our synthetic spectra .",
    "note that some chemical mixing has been done to mimic the effects of multi - dimensional fluid instabilities ( e.g. , rayleigh - taylor ) .",
    "the moderate mixing softens the composition gradients but preserves the strong ejecta stratification , hydrogen being absent in the inner 3 solar masses of the ejecta ( below 1500 ) .",
    "the @xmath2ni mass fraction is sizable only below 10002000  but owing to mixing , shows a non - zero mass fraction even at the outer edge of the ejecta .",
    "this is unphysical but tests we performed show that such a low @xmath2ni abundance does not impact the gas , nor the radiation , properties in regions exterior to a velocity of 4500(the ejecta photospheric velocity at the end of our time sequence ) during the 21-day timespan we cover .",
    ".ejecta composition , given in solar masses , of the `` lm18a7ad '' model used as input for our radiative - transfer computations . note that all metal mass - fractions have a floor value corresponding to the lmc metallicity .",
    "the total ejecta mass is approximately 15.6 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the simulations we present here were performed over a relatively short time , starting at 0.27d after breakout and ending at 20.8d .",
    "while it may seem a short time compared to the bolometric evolution ( with , for example , a light - curve peak at @xmath080d ) , this corresponds to an increase in radius by a factor of 77 for all mass shells .",
    "hence , over the 46 timesteps computed , the sn ejecta expanded enormously , and the associated changes at the photosphere , as well as above and underneath it , are large . throughout the discussion",
    ", we define the sn photosphere as the ejecta location where the inward - integrated electron - scattering optical depth is 2/3 . in the following section , we first present the evolution of the ejecta properties , before presenting synthetic spectra and light curves .",
    "to illustrate the drastic evolution of the ejecta conditions over this @xmath021-day span , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot ] the radius , the velocity , the temperature , and the electron density at the photosphere ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) and as a function of time after shock breakout .",
    "these quantities have been scaled to fit within the same plotting range .",
    "they are also given in table  [ tab_prop ] , together with the base ejecta optical depth ( taking electron - scattering as the only opacity source for the purpose of that table ) and the emergent bolometric luminosity .    during this 21-day timespan the photospheric radius increases monotonically by over a factor of 10 from 6.0@xmath3610@xmath52 to 8.1@xmath3610@xmath53 cm , while the photospheric velocity drops from 23000 to 4500 .",
    "the decrease in photospheric velocity testifies for the recession of the photosphere in mass .",
    "the photospheric temperature drops precipitously from 38100k due to the fast expansion , but plateaus after 510 days at 5200k , which corresponds to the hydrogen - recombination temperature - it will then remain at this value until the nebular phase .",
    "note that our adoption of a floor temperature ( originally 5000k , and then decreased to 3000k after 0.45d , and down to 2500k after 2.8d ) , used to avoid exponential overflow for evaluations involving very high ionization species , is well below the temperature of the photosphere at any time , and does not affect its properties .",
    "the electron density at the photosphere varies by about a factor of ten during the 21-day span ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot ] ) .",
    "this is because the optical depth at the photosphere is fixed by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the continuum mass - absorption coefficient and @xmath56 is the mass density .",
    "its position adjusts as the ejecta expand , scaling as the inverse of the photospheric radius . in the meantime ,",
    "the total ejecta optical depth has decreased from 2.3@xmath3610@xmath57 to 3700 ( we quote the values for the electron - scattering optical depth , which differs little at such times and in such hydrogen - rich ejecta from that associated with the rosseland - mean opacity ) .",
    "the photosphere location lies , in velocity space , above 4500 at all times , and thus the composition at the photosphere has not changed through the 21-day evolution ( see fig .",

    "but regions lacking @xmath2ni and situated at large optical depth should evolve at constant @xmath72 .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_temp ] , we show the time evolution of that quantity @xmath72 obtained in our simulations , plotted for all ejecta mass shells as a function of time ( we use a logarithmic scale for the abscissa for visibility ) . at early times , all the curves overlap , but within a few days , a pronounced  bump \" forms below 2000 , an excess which is caused by the energy contribution from radioactive decay .",
    "importantly , we note that it does not extend beyond 2000 , implying that the locally - deposited energy from decay has not had time to diffuse out , even at 20.8 days after explosion .",

    "it is caused by hydrogen recombination , which severely depletes the density of free electrons . at depth , a similar but more modest deviation occurs , and is associated with the recombination of helium .",
    "while hydrogen and to a lesser extent helium recombination impact the electron density visibly , all species present in the ejecta , no matter how relatively under - abundant , will recombine from their high ionization states at the time of breakout to a neutral or once - ionized state after a few days / weeks .",

    "the key characteristics that apply to all is that the ionization is high at low velocity , reaches a minimum around the photosphere , but increases again at high velocity ( in particular for the dominant species hydrogen and helium ) .",
    "this behavior reflects the ionization freeze - out in fast - expanding low - density sn ejecta , and stems from incorporating time - dependent terms in the statistical - equilibrium and energy equations @xcite .",
    "this ionization freeze - out can not prevent recombination altogether , but the effect is large enough to dramatically alter the strength of numerous strong lines , such as hi balmer lines or naid ( see  [ sect_comp_to_obs ] ) .",

    "this is then followed by a slow decrease to @xmath865000k over a number of days . as expected , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_synthetic_spectra_early ] , we obtain synthetic spectra whose peak - flux shifts very rapidly during these initial two days , from around 300   to 3000 . over that time , the uv flux drops by about two orders of magnitude while the optical flux rises by a factor of a few .",
    "the uv flux is initially highly wavelength - dependent , caused by strong line blanketing from multiple ions . in contrast , the optical suffers little from line blanketing at early times and the corresponding flux is essentially featureless .",

    "[ fig_ltau ] the spectral regions where important line blocking occurs at three epochs , differentiating the contributing ions with a color coding . at 0.33d ,",

    "niii and niiii would also contribute but have not been included in this calculation . in the optical , a small number of lines ( relative to the forest of metal lines ) associated with hi and hei",

    "[ fig_ltau ] for an example at 9.8d ) , which decreases by a total of about five orders of magnitude from 0.3d to 20d .",
    "in contrast , past 34 days and after the disappearance of hei 5877 , the optical range evolves slowly with a strengthening of the hydrogen balmer lines , caii , and metals of low - ionization state ( siii , tiii , feii , coii ) .",
    "our simulations do not include niii  iv in the model atom , and have zero abundance for scandium and barium .",
    "hence , no microphysical processes associated with these species / ions are predicted by our computations .",
    "we wish to emphasize that at all times line blanketing severely depletes any overlapping flux .",
    "it achieves this very effectively in the uv , in association with ions that may have a high or low ionization state .",
    "line blanketing is thus not born when conditions are cool ; it is instead the case that as conditions cool , the spectral region where line blanketing occurs shifts towards ( observed ) optical spectral regions .",
    "one must also recall that as this takes place , the peak of the flux distribution shifts to longer wavelengths , so that there is less and less flux to block .",
    "for example , at 20d , the line blanketing caused by feii is enormous at uv wavelengths , but there is hardly any photons injected at the thermalization depth in the uv at such times .",
    "inferring the photospheric velocity of the sn ejecta from spectroscopic observations at a given epoch is important as it enters the determination of the total kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "it is also a key component for the determination of distances to type ii sne using the expanding - photosphere method @xcite , the spectral - fitting expanding - atmosphere method @xcite , or the standard - candle method @xcite . in fig .",

    "we find that at early times all lines tend to show a maximum absorption at a doppler velocity that underestimates the photospheric velocity ( shown in black ) , for a reason discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "however , once a given line strengthens , that doppler velocity then overestimates the photospheric velocity , by an amount that varies from being large for h@xmath35 , to modest for h@xmath87 and h@xmath1 . for feii 5169",
    ", this doppler velocity underestimates the theoretical photospheric velocity at all times prior to @xmath015d , and modestly overestimates it afterwards .    in a separate test calculation ,",
    "not shown here , we evolved the same hydrodynamical model but with a three times larger iron abundance . in that case , the feii 5169 - line was stronger at all times and the corresponding velocity location of maximum profile absorption matched more closely the photospheric velocity .",
    "the accuracy of using the feii 5169  line for inferring the photospheric velocity is thus conditioned by the environmental metallicity , and may therefore vary with redshift or galaxy hosts .      to conclude this section on synthetic radiative properties , we present the bolometric light curve for our time sequence in fig .  [ fig_lbol ] .",
    "starting at 0.3d , we miss the breakout phase , but capture the steep fall - off that immediately follows it until the luminosity levels off after about 7 days . beyond that",

    "[ fig_lbol ] , we overplot the prediction of the one - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics v1d code , as described in @xcite .",
    "this computation is done assuming gray transport ( i.e. , one group ) , a mean opacity that neglects line contributions , and flux - limited diffusion .",
    "the bolometric luminosity obtained with this much coarser approach agrees to within @xmath020% .",
    "furthermore , our non - lte time - dependent line - blanketed treatment , shows an evolution that agrees with the inferred observed bolometric light curve as well as the radiation - hydrodynamics results obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .  8 for comparison with both their models and the inferred bolometric luminosity ) .",
    "the luminosity plateau and subsequent increase after @xmath07d occurs at a time when the @xmath2ni energy which , in this model , we deposit at depths below @xmath02000(there is a buffer of about 10 between the photosphere and the @xmath2ni - rich regions at that time ) , has not had time to diffuse out .",
    "the  instantaneous \" diffusion time for these inner and very dense layers is indeed orders of magnitude larger than the age of the sn .",
    "hence , this plateau and subsequent re - brightening is not caused / triggered by energy deposition from unstable isotopes , but results instead from the rate at which the photospheric radius and temperature happen to evolve in the shock - heated envelope .",
    "seven days after explosion corresponds to the time in our simulations when the photospheric temperature becomes essentially constant at @xmath865000k , which corresponds to conditions under which hydrogen recombines to its neutral state . at the same time , the photospheric radius continues to grow and the flux has to go up ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_phot ] for an illustration of those trajectories ) .",
    "the photospheric velocity at that time is @xmath09000and there is no dramatic change in density gradient at that location .",

    "we scale our synthetic spectra adopting a distance of 50kpc to the lmc @xcite . when corrected for extinction , as when we compare to observed spectra and magnitudes , we employ a reddening @xmath88 and the reddening law of @xcite .",

    "we obtain an excellent agreement for the optical bands @xmath91 , but our predictions for the @xmath92-band magnitude is offset , predicted too bright at all times .",
    "this discrepancy could be somewhat reduced , although not resolved , by choosing a slightly higher reddening of 0.2mag .",
    "the @xmath92-band magnitude decrease is also too slow in our simulations , and levels at a minimum that is @xmath01 - 1.5mag too bright .",
    "this mismatch may be physical , perhaps reflecting a slight offset in the density distribution in the progenitor surface layers .",
    "the progenitor star model should perhaps have a slightly smaller radius , resulting in a faster evolution of the sed to longer , optical , wavelengths .",
    "it may also be associated with opacity issues , stemming from under - abundant but nonetheless important species we presently ignore .",
    "for example , we are not including al , which has strong resonance lines in the uv , or , e.g. , cr , ar , ne which do contribute opacity there .",
    "we may be missing some low ionization stages , e.g. , niii or fei , although the @xmath92-band magnitude mismatch is present at all times , not just at late times when the photospheric conditions are cool .",
    "finally , we may be using a too small model atom for some species .",
    "for example , we include only 115 levels of feii , which we find yields converged results at early times , but is not quite sufficient when feii is the dominant fe ion ( we find that enhancing the number of feii levels from 115 to 827 at the recombination epoch ( past day 5 ) leads to a reduction of the already extremely small flux in the 1000 - 2000  range , but leaves the spectrum at longer wavelengths unaffected ) .",
    "recall here that iron has a mass fraction of less than 0.001 in our model , while hydrogen is the most abundant element and is the main donor of the free - electrons that provide the bulk of the opacity . in any case , the mismatch can not be associated with something sizably inadequate in the progenitor model or in the code since we obtain excellent agreement for the optical bands .",
    "it also intervenes in regions where the flux is orders of magnitude smaller than in the optical , or orders of magnitude smaller than what it used to be at 0.3d .",
    "but this goes to show that even in the case of sn1987a , for which we have tight constraints on the progenitor star and the explosion properties , obtaining a complete agreement is a challenge .",
    "we present in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_spect_montage ] a montage of all observed uv and optical spectra of sn1987a up to 20 days after explosion .",

    "overall , the synthetic spectra shown in the right panel mirror with high fidelity the observed spectra shown in the left panel .    for the first few epochs , echoing what was seen already in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] , the synthetic fluxes are somewhat larger than observed .",
    "the color temperature is slightly too large , as is the ionization state of the photosphere , so that all lines appear weaker above the continuum .",

    "interestingly , the h@xmath87 line is not as well fitted as h@xmath35 , although its formation process is analogous , and this discrepancy lasts for about a week .    continuing onwards , the ejecta recombine at the photosphere and the uv flux essentially vanishes .",
    "we fit the h@xmath35 line profile and its evolution very well , both quantitatively in strength and width , but also qualitatively in its shape ( i.e. , how the flux varies from the blue edge to the red edge of the profile ) .",
    "this suggests that , together , our calculations and the initial model allow an accurate description of the h@xmath35 line - formation process ; the density distribution and the kinetic energy of the original model are well suited .",
    "this contrasts with the former discrepancy in balmer - line strengths encountered by @xcite , which at the time were associated with the potential role of clumping ( note that no clumping is used here ) . the good reproduction of balmer - line strengths or naid supports the adequacy of our computed non - lte time - dependent ionization structure . as pointed out by @xcite , and independently confirmed by @xcite , the competing recombination and expansion timescales for the ejecta lead to an ionization freeze - out , particularly visible in the optically - thin fast - expanding low - density regions .",

    "@xcite suggest that such time - dependent effects are much weaker , but their presentation for the recombination phase of sn1987a is unconvincing since they use models that are fully - ionized and uv bright ( in contradiction with observations ) . furthermore , despite the one - dimensionality of our approach , we achieve very competitive fits to observations .",
    "one may argue the unresolved problems we encounter are caused by those neglected multi - dimensional effects , but we surmise this departure from sphericity would also alter line profile shapes etc .",
    ", which are fairly well reproduced ( see , e.g. , h@xmath35 ) .",
    "we predict the fastest spectral evolution in sn1987a occurred prior to day 1 . from 0.3d to 1d ,",
    "most of the flux was emitted in the range 300 - 3000  which could have been captured by the iue satellite .",
    "prior to 0.27d , the photosphere would have shone at shorter wavelengths , but the uv range would have revealed the long - wavelength tail of that sed , testifying for the hotter conditions at earlier post - breakout times .",
    "this suggests that obtaining multiple observations prior to day 1 , across as broad a wavelength range as possible , would have captured the phase of fastest evolution of sn1987a .",
    "while the uv shows the largest changes , multiple spectra , rather than a unique spectrum , of sn1987a during both the first and the second night of its evolution would have been valuable.m allows us to gather information on ca and cno lines in the red part of the spectrum , as well as constrain the reddening with the blue part . ]",
    "this applies to some extent to type ii - p sn as well , although their evolution is slower . in type",
    "i sne , the sed likely evolves too fast after breakout to allow us to capture it , but then , the first few days after explosion would be very useful for constraining the surface composition of the progenitor .",
    "overall , observing frequently at early times would provide important constraints that are generally missing in current observations .",
    "the work presented here is an essential benchmarking of our code since sn1987a is one of the best understood and best observed supernova .",
    "as it places numerous and tight observational constraints , it offers _ a valuable alternative , although not a replacement , _ to benchmarking against other codes .",
    "the combined approach of using non - lte , time dependence , and line blanketing seems very promising .",
    "the future from here is to systematize such investigations by evolving a wide range of ejecta for all supernova types and compare results with multi - epoch multi - wavelength observations .",
    "the aim is then to use such models and observations to make quantitative inferences on the progenitor properties , pre - sn star evolution , and the explosion mechanism . in the context of sn1987a",
    ", we now need to repeat the present exploration with a variety of progenitor stars and explosion properties , in order to delineate the systematics associated with core - collapse sn explosions of bsg stars . in parallel",
    ", it would be valuable to gather additional and high quality observational data for similar type ii - peculiar events like sn1987a .",
    "we thank stan woosley for providing the input hydrodynamical model that was used as initial conditions for our radiative - transfer calculations .",
    "we would also like to thank bob kurucz , the people involved with the nist atomic data base , and the participants of the opacity and iron projects ( with special thanks to keith butler , sultana nahar , anil pradhan , and peter storey ) for computing and supplying atomic data to the astrophysical community  without their work these calculations would not be possible .",
