    "a deep understanding of the turbulent flow field @xmath4 remains a challenging problem .",
    "extensions of the classical theory of turbulence by kolmogorov @xcite consider a multiplicity of algebraic scaling exponents for moments of velocity increments @xmath5 in the inertial range of length scales @xmath6 , which are spanned roughly between the kolmogorov dissipation scale @xmath7 and the outer scale of turbulence @xmath8 .",
    "the longitudinal increment moments ( or structure functions ) are then given as @xmath9 where the scaling exponents @xmath10 depend nonlinearly on the order @xmath11 but not on the reynolds number @xmath1 , as long as the latter is sufficiently large .",
    "the dimensional coefficients @xmath12 depend at most on large - scale quantities .",
    "this nonlinear dependence of the algebraic scaling exponents @xmath10 on the moment order @xmath11 is a manifestation of the inertial - range intermittency , which is generally agreed to be an important feature of three - dimensional turbulence .",
    "inertial - range intermittency was experimentally first quantified by anselmet _",
    "starting with the work of kolmogorov @xcite and oboukhov @xcite , numerous phenomenological models have been developed to study and describe intermittency ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the most dominant underlying theme of these models has been the multifractal formalism @xcite .",
    "there is a similar intermittency in the dissipative scales .",
    "this , too , has been experimentally characterized since ref .",
    "@xcite , and many models have been developed as well ( see , again , @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "the relation between the two intermittencies has been the subject of the so - called refined similarity hypothesis ( rsh ) put forth in @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis links the statistics of the velocity increments at inertial scales with that of the velocity gradients at smaller scales where inertial and viscous ranges match .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was recognized that dissipation intermittency implies an infinite number of dissipative scales , @xmath13 . using this insight , nelkin @xcite worked out the reynolds number dependence of the moments of velocity derivatives .",
    "frisch and vergassola @xcite denoted the range of dissipation scales spanning between @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the intermediate dissipation range .",
    "their geometric picture of the continuum of dissipation scales is that each element of the range would possess a local hlder exponent @xmath16 , which characterizes the spatial roughness of subsets of velocity increments in the inertial range .",
    "consequently , the minimum and maximum values of the dissipation scale would be controlled by the smallest and the largest hlder exponents : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "later , chevillard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the intermediate dissipation range within a random cascade model that takes @xmath19 as a product of a gaussian random variable and a positive ( scale - dependent ) transfer variable .",
    "they found that @xmath20 .",
    "the relation of the intermediate dissipation range to the decay of energy spectra was discussed recently in the context of well - resolved shell models @xcite .",
    "efforts have also been made to obtain @xmath21 directly from the navier - stokes equations but the problem has remained a great challenge .",
    "we limit ourselves here to citing the work of @xcite  in part because of the connection to the present work and in part because the author kept his considerations close to the dynamical equations .",
    "the theory has been extended @xcite to explore the connection between the viscous and inertial range intermittencies .",
    "this extension builds on the notion that the fluctuating dissipation scale @xmath13 is to be considered a field that varies in space and time .",
    "a relevant feature of the theory is its prediction for the scaling of velocity gradients in terms of the exponents @xmath10 .    within this overall framework",
    ", the present paper accomplishes the following goals .",
    "first , we perform direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with vastly better spectral resolution than anytime earlier . as was explicitly stated by nelkin @xcite , such superfine resolutions are required to compute the derivatives accurately .",
    "second , we then study the relation between the inertial and dissipative regions within the framework of existing theories , namely rsh and theory of @xcite . after describing the theoretical basis @xcite and the details on the numerical simulations ( sec .  1 )",
    ", we discuss the analyticity and scaling of the velocity increment moments in sec .  2 and present our findings on the velocity gradient statistics in sec .",
    "we also compare in sec .  3 our results with those of previous work , study in detail the crossover of the statistics of the velocity gradients from gaussian to non - gaussian regime and",
    "discuss our results in the light of the multifractal formalism .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result of the present work is that , while we find no evidence for the inertial range in the dns data ( even when examined through the extended self - similarity , or ess ) , the measured scaling exponents of velocity gradients agree well with those deduced from the longitudinal structure functions at _ infinitely high reynolds numbers_. this suggests that the asymptotic state of turbulence is attained for the velocity gradients at far lower reynolds numbers , well short of those required for the inertial range to appear .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook in sec .  4 .",

    "the traditional scales are the kolmogorov length and velocity scales @xmath7 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "this scaling works well for low order moments ( say 2 ) , as seen in figure  [ fig1]a . the same normalization is not adequate for high orders such as 10 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "however , all curves do collapse when the length scale @xmath63 ( see equation ( [ etan ] ) ) and the corresponding velocity scale @xmath136 are used instead of @xmath137 and @xmath126 ( see figure  [ fig1]c ) .",

    "for this case , however , the velocity gradient statistics are gaussian , in contrast to the other three cases .",
    "this issue will be discussed in greater detail in sec .  3.2 . ]",
    "how can we understand this collapse ? introducing the  dynamic \" reynolds number @xmath139 , and recalling that the only relevant parameter in the inertial range  including the interval just above the dissipation range ( @xmath140)is the energy flux",
    ", we can conclude that the dynamics of fluctuations at the scales @xmath141 are independent of the width of the inertial range @xmath142 .",
    "while one can not , in principle , rule out the existence of other fluxes corresponding to some yet unknown integrals of motion related to structure functions of higher order than 2 @xcite , this possibility will not influence the essence of the argument .",

    "the insets in both figures show the corresponding local slope @xmath146 as given by relation ( [ localslope ] ) .",
    "data of runs 2,3 and 5 are indicated by different colours , as noted in the legend . ]    since no inertial - range scaling can be observed for such low reynolds numbers in the standard double logarithmic plot , we tested the method of extended self - similarity ( ess ) by benzi _",
    "as is well known , the main point of ess is that even though there is no discernible scaling in the standard plot when the reynolds numbers are low , one can detect a sizeable range of scaling when arbitrary moment orders are compared with @xmath147 : @xmath148 the sensitive and scale - dependent measure for possible anomalous scaling is then the local slope @xmath149 the results for our data are shown in figure  [ esscheck ] for the fourth and tenth order . in both figures we can not detect anomalous scaling in the ess framework , which would result in local slopes of @xmath150 and @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that only a further increase of the reynolds number will shift the local slope toward the asymptotic values .",
    "thus , even the  backdoor \" of ess is not opened for our small reynolds numbers .",
    "it confirms our statement made before that the velocity field statistics does not have any asymptotic scaling in the inertial range .",
    "the inset reveals an interesting feature .",
    "it can be observed that a faster relaxation towards anomalous scaling occurs with increasing order . at this point , we can only speculate about the reason for this feature .",
    "on one hand , the differences between the viscous scaling , @xmath152 , and the inertial scaling , @xmath153 , become larger with increasing order and thus better visible in the local slope . on the other hand ,",
    "an order - dependence of the dissipation scale , @xmath51 , might cause a slight increase of the inertial range and the crossover between inertial and viscous ranges , respectively .",
    "if indeed the properties of fluctuations from the interval @xmath143 depend only upon the local magnitude of the energy flux @xmath154 and _ not _ upon the width of the inertial range @xmath142 , one can hope to obtain the asymptotic values of exponents @xmath155 in reasonably low - reynolds - number flows , provided that a small ( even very small ) constant - flux range exists for scales @xmath156 .    in figure  [ fig3 ] ,",

    "for example , we get @xmath160 compared to the theoretical value of 0.465 . the second order exponent @xmath91 is given by @xmath161 which is very close to the experimental value of @xmath162 @xcite .",

    "the moments of the dissipation rate also agree with theoretical predictions , as shown in table  [ tabtwo ] .     for orders 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 7 as functions of the box reynolds number @xmath1 .",
    "only the filled data points were included in the least square fit , but run 6 demonstrates that the scaling continues for higher reynolds number .",

    "these structure functions probe very intense , low - probability velocity fluctuations and , as a result , huge data sets are needed to accurately evaluate their characteristics .",

    "the magnitudes of @xmath188 and @xmath189 varied , respectively , around zero and three ( even for very long - time runs ) .",
    "we verified this by choosing different wave vectors for driving the flow while leaving all other simulation parameters the same , including the energy injection rate @xmath35 ( see equation  ( [ epsiloninput ] ) ) . at larger reynolds numbers , @xmath190 or @xmath191",
    ", the derivative moments became insensitive to the particular driving .",
    "therefore , our studies suggest that the transition to non - gaussian statistics is smooth with respect to the reynolds number and that intermittency continuously grows with the growing number of excited modes .",
    "figure [ isolevel ] illustrates the morphological changes of the spatial distribution of the velocity gradient that are connected with the change of the statistical properties .",
    "the increasing intermittency of the velocity gradients is accompanied by an increasing fragmentation of the isolevel sets .",
    "turbulence in a three - dimensional periodic box , generated by the navier - stokes equations driven by a large - scale forcing , was investigated in the taylor microscale reynolds numbers range @xmath192 .",
    "the simulations were made with superfine resolution in order to resolve the analytic part of structure functions at least up to order 16 .",
    "no inertial ranges characterized by the velocity structure functions @xmath193 were detected  not even with the method of extended self - similarity . in the range @xmath194 , strong intermittency of the spatial derivatives",
    "was detected and their moments were accurately described by the scaling relations @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath113 and @xmath197 were found to be in essential agreement with the theoretical work for high reynolds number @xcite . based on the well - resolved numerical results , we are thus able to relate the dissipation - range exponents of the velocity gradients to the inertial range scaling exponents of the velocity field for very high reynolds numbers . for instance , the dns result @xmath198 gives @xmath199 corresponding to the asymptotic high - reynolds number energy spectrum @xmath200 .",
    "the competing theoretical predictions are from rsh ( for dissipation ) and the multifractal theory ( for the gradients ) .",
    "they , too , agree with the dns results , although somewhat less successfully overall .",
    "it appears that the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite seems to have an edge .",
    "this last conclusion would have been more conclusive if we had been able to obtain reliable dissipation range statistics accurately for moments of order 5 or 6 . despite the huge data sets of @xmath201 points , we were unable to obtain reliable data for dissipation field moments with @xmath202 , certainly for @xmath11 no larger than 5 .",
    "the theory suggests the reason for this problem : moments of the dissipation rate @xmath203 are related to high - order structure functions @xmath204 probing very low probability fluctuations evaluated on the corresponding dissipation scales .",
    "we also conducted simulations at various reynolds numbers to study the smooth transition of the velocity gradient statistics from the gaussian behaviour to the non - gaussian behaviour .",
    "our work suggests that the scaling exponents of the moments of velocity derivatives observed in the relatively low - reynolds - number turbulent flow , lacking even traces of the inertial range , can be expressed in terms of the inertial - range exponents corresponding to the _ asymptotic _ case ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "we stress that the scaling exponents @xmath206 and @xmath197 of the moments of velocity derivatives and dissipation rate reach asymptotic values that are independent of large - scale reynolds number , even at low values of the reynolds numbers .",
    "thus , the dynamics of velocity fluctuations at the scales @xmath141 are asymptotic even in relatively low - reynolds - number flows .",
    "this could mean that the magnitudes of inertial - range exponents ( @xmath207 are prescribed by the matching conditions on the ultra - violet cut - offs formed in the low - reynolds - number regimes .",
