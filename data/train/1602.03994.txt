    "the experimental detection of a spontaneous edge current could be direct evidence of chiral superconductivity .",

    "the topological chern number @xmath11 or @xmath12 corresponds to the angular momentum of a cooper pair .",
    "in addition to chiral @xmath0-wave superconductivity , the possibilities of chiral @xmath1-wave ( @xmath13 ) and chiral @xmath2-wave ( @xmath14 ) superconductivity have been discussed in recent experiments .",
    "@xcite several theories have suggested that the amount of edge current become smaller in a chiral superconductor with a larger @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite however , unfortunately , no spontaneous chiral current has yet been experimentally observed .",
    "@xcite    the absence of spontaneous magnetization in experiments has mainly been attributed to three effects : ( i ) the meissner screening of the edge current by the bulk superconducting condensate , ( ii ) the reduction of the chiral current by the potential disorder near the surface of a superconductor , and ( iii ) the complicated electronic structures of superconductors .",
    "the first effect was partially studied by matsumoto and sigrist .",
    "@xcite they theoretically confirmed a reduction in the edge current caused by the meissner effect in a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "however , the resulting spontaneous magnetization is large enough to be measured in experiments .",
    "the second effect is linked to the issue of the intrinsic angular momentum in the @xmath16he - a phase .",
    "@xcite experimentally it is difficult to make a superconducting sample with a specular surface .",
    "for instance , a small ruthenate superconductor cluster can be fabricated by using the focused ion beam technique , @xcite which would seriously damage the sample quality near the surface .",
    "several theoretical papers have already suggested the presence of edge states in a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor when there is surface roughness .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , when a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor is covered by a clean normal metal , the chiral current is dramatically reduced.@xcite the third effect has been discussed specifically in sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 .",
    "it has been known that the gap anisotropy@xcite and the multiband structures  @xcite suppress the chiral edge current . even today",
    ", we do not know how the meissner screening and the surface roughness reduce the edge current in chiral @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconductors .",
    "in previous papers , @xcite we studied the andreev bound states @xcite ( abss ) in time - reversal non - chiral superconductors characterized by @xmath17-wave or @xmath18-wave pair potentials .",
    "we found that the abss in a @xmath18-wave superconductor are robust even in the presence of surface roughness , whereas those in a @xmath1-wave superconductor are fragile against surface roughness .",
    "this conclusion is well explained by the symmetry of the cooper pairs induced near the surface .",
    "however , it is unclear if it is possible to generalize our conclusions straightforwardly to chiral superconductors .",
    "we will address these issues in the present paper .    in this paper , we theoretically study the spontaneous edge currents and the spontaneous magnetization in a small chiral superconducting disk based on the quasiclassical eilenberger formalism . to discuss the relation between the pairing symmetry and the sensitivity of the chiral edge current to the surface roughness , we consider the simple chiral order parameters on a circular shaped fermi surface . by solving the eilenberger and maxwell equations self - consistently and simultaneously , we obtain the spatial profiles of the chiral edge currents and the temperature dependence of a spontaneous magnetization . the surface roughness is considered in terms of the impurity self - energy of a quasiparticle . to define the magnetization of a sample , we need to consider a finite - size superconductor such as disks .",
    "moreover , setting the radius of a disk to be comparable to the coherence length allows us to justify the assumption that there is no chiral - domain wall in a disk .",
    "we conclude that the robustness of the spontaneous edge current depends strongly on the paring symmetry . in a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor ,",
    "the amplitude of the chiral current in a disk with a rough surface is comparable to that in a disk with a specular surface . in a chiral @xmath1-wave superconductor ,",
    "there are two edge channels in a disk with a specular surface .",
    "they carry the chiral currents in opposite directions . in the presence of surface roughness , one channel near",
    "the surface disappears and the other channel far from the surface carries the robust chiral current .",
    "we show that the surface roughness changes the net - current direction in a chiral @xmath1-wave disk .",
    "the edge current in a chiral @xmath2-wave superconductor is fragile in the presence of surface roughness .",
    "the effects of meissner screening on the chiral edge current depend on the spatial current distribution near the surface .",
    "when the current decreases monotonically with increases in the distance from the surface , the meissner effect always reduces the chiral current . on the other hand ,",
    "when the chiral current changes its direction as a function of distance from the surface , the meissner screening effect becomes weaker .",
    "such a complicated current distribution causes the self - screening effect among edge currents flowing in opposite directions .",
