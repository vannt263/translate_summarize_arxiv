    "investigating high redshift galaxies as well as other distant objects in the early universe , especially within the first 1 gyr after the big bang , has been the key to understanding how galaxies have formed and evolved , probe their star formation histories , and constrain the epoch of cosmic reionization .",
    "the latest measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) constrained the optical depth to electron scattering during reionization and suggests that the average redshift of reionization was @xmath8 @xcite . also , gunn - peterson ( gp ) troughs @xcite in @xmath7 quasar spectra imply reionization ended at @xmath7 with an estimated fraction of intergalactic medium ( igm ) neutral hydrogen , @xmath90.04 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a spectral modeling analysis of a @xmath10 gamma ray burst ( grb ) shows that the universe seems to have been largely reionized at @xmath10 with @xmath11 and the upper limit of @xmath120.6 , which suggests only some reasonable amount of neutral gas in the grb host galaxy @xcite .",
    "another probe of reionization is ly@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) , young galaxies in the distant universe showing in their spectra redshifted ly@xmath1 emission from their interstellar gas illuminated by massive stars .",
    "the observed ly@xmath1 line luminosity function ( ly@xmath1 lf ) is expected to decline beyond the redshift @xmath7 where reionization is thought to have completed as the increasing fraction of igm neutral hydrogen absorbs or scatters the ly@xmath1 photons from young galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent lae surveys show that ly@xmath1 lf seems not to change from @xmath13 to 5.7 @xcite . for the earlier epoch ,",
    "@xcite suggest that ly@xmath1 lf does not evolve between @xmath4 and 6.6",
    ". this might be because their sample could be somewhat biased since it consists of several lae subsamples taken from various surveys with different kinds of factors such as selection criteria , analysis methods , sky areas , survey volumes , and depths in order to compile as large a sample as possible .    on the other hand , the subaru deep field ( * ?",
    "* sdf ) surveys have tried to keep all these factors as consistent as possible among different redshifts , surveyed exceptionally large volume and made large amount of lae samples at @xmath14 , 5.7 and 6.6 .",
    "their latest survey has for the first time confirmed that the ly@xmath1 lf declines as @xmath15(0.40.6 ) from @xmath4 to 6.6 even after correcting cosmic variance @xcite . from this decline of the lf",
    ", they estimated the upper limit of the neutral fraction at @xmath6 to be @xmath16 . if the nenutral igm remains at @xmath17% level at @xmath6 , this constraint supports late reionization and contradicts the _ wmap _ result .",
    "also , the decline of ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath46.6 can also be ascribed to the evolution of lae population itself .",
    "meanwhile , the ionized fraction @xmath18 and the morphology of h@xmath19 regions during patchy reionization would modulate the observed distribution of laes and enhance the observed clustering of them @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the angular correlation function of the sdf photometric sample of @xmath6 laes obtained by @xcite and suggest that the universe is fully ionized at @xmath6 with the mean volume ionized fraction of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite also pointed out the difficulty in distinguishing the effect of evolution of lae population on ly@xmath1 lf from that of reionization .",
    "lfs of high-@xmath21 galaxies also tell us about galaxy evolution itself in terms of how many galaxies existed at each luminosity and epoch in the history of the universe and how it has changed with cosmic time . to obtain this kind of information at high redshifts , lfs of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and laes",
    "have been mainly observed .",
    "ultraviolet continuum luminosity functions ( uvlfs ) of lbgs have been investigated from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and found to decline as redshift increases @xcite . since the uv continuum redder than 1216  is not attenuated by neutral igm hydrogen and if dust extinction is precisely corrected , the decline of uvlf reflects the evolution of galaxies .",
    "one recently observed example of this is a large decline of uvlf of dropout galaxies at @xmath248 , which is considered to be a clear sign of galaxy evolution over these redshifts @xcite . they conclude that very luminous galaxies are quite rare at @xmath08 . on the other hand , the uvlf of laes was confirmed not to evolve at @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "in addition , studying laes in an even wider sky region ,",
    "@xmath26 deg@xmath27 of the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ) field , @xcite found that uvlf of laes increases from @xmath28 to 5.7 while ly@xmath1 lf of them remains unchanged over these redshifts , suggesting that the fraction of uv - bright laes increases at @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , no evolution of lae uvlf from @xmath4 to 6.6 was observed while ly@xmath1 lf of laes evolves between these epochs in the latest sdf survey @xcite .",
    "this implies that laes themselves do not significantly evolve from @xmath6 to 5.7 and the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf might reflect the effect of reionization .",
    "however , we do not know if this trend of the ly@xmath1 lf and uvlf of laes continues from even earlier epochs . in other words , it is not clear whether lae population evolves from @xmath29 as lbg does and the neutral igm fraction increases to suppress the ly@xmath1 lf more severely beyond @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the existence of the galaxies at @xmath29 has not been confirmed by spectroscopy yet though several photometric candidates have been found .",
    "these questions can be addressed by observing laes and their lfs at @xmath29 .",
    "investigating their change over longer cosmic time interval , we can constrain the galaxy evolution and reionization more tightly .",
    "one possible method of detecting @xmath29 laes is a narrowband filter imaging in infrared region .",
    "however , beyond the redward limit of ccd sensitivity , the large format mosaicing advantages of infrared arrays are not yet available and observations of high redshift laes is limited to a small survey volume .",
    "though recent infrared detectors have achieved extremely high sensitivities , surveys with them can not avoid large uncertianty due to cosmic variance .",
    "therefore , we carried out a narrowband survey of @xmath0 laes using the final window of oh - airglow at the very edge of the optical regime still accessible with ccds of subaru prime focus camera ( * ? ? ? *",
    "suprime - cam ) having a superb wide field of view , @xmath30 .",
    "we chose the wavelength region 96559855  open to the highest redshift optical narrowband survey .",
    "although this might not be considered quite an adequate window since there are several oh lines in the region , the estimated fraction of the sky counts coming from oh lines in the window is not prohibitively large ( only @xmath31 photons s@xmath32",
    "@xmath32 arcsec@xmath33 m@xmath33 ) and we actually succeeded in making a narrowband filter named nb973 covering this wavelength region .",
    "this range corresponds to a redshift of @xmath34 for laes .    to discover such extremely high redshift laes and make a sample of them as consistent as possible with those of @xmath4 and 6.6 laes obtained by @xcite and @xcite , we targeted the same field , sdf using 8.2-m subaru telescope / suprime - cam .",
    "our brief and preliminary result has been recently reported in @xcite . in this survey",
    ", we successfully confirmed a @xmath3 lae spectroscopically and observed that the number density of @xmath0 lae further declines from @xmath6 by a factor of 0.180.36 , suggesting that the neutral hydrogen might increase between these epochs .",
    "however , we do not know whether there had been any possible evolution of lae population itself from @xmath0 to 6.6 , and the density dificit might come from such a galaxy evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we present the methods and results of our photometric and spectroscopic surveys for @xmath0 laes , which were not fully covered in @xcite , and try to draw out as much useful information as possible about the epoch of reionization and the lae galaxy evolution from our results combined with the most recent high redshift galaxy surveys and a lae evolution model based on hierarchical clustering .",
    "we first describe the properties of our narrowband filter nb973 and imaging observation in 2 .",
    "then , selection criteria of @xmath0 lae candidates based on narrow and broadband images are derived in detail and their photometric properties are analyzed in 3 . in 4 , we explain the results of our follow - up spectroscopy of the selected candidates and their spectroscopic properties . in 5 ,",
    "we compare ly@xmath1 and uv lfs of @xmath0 laes with those of @xmath4 and 6.6 laes derived from the latest samples obtained by the sdf lae surveys @xcite and discuss what implications the result gives for cosmic reionization and galaxy evolution . also , any possibilities of lae galaxy evolution at @xmath47 are inspected by observational and theoreical approaches . in the last section ,",
    "we conclude and summarize our results . throughout",
    "we adapt a concordance cosmology with ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) @xmath38 , and ab magnitudes with @xmath39 diameter aperture unless otherwise specified .",
    "we developed a narrowband filter , nb973 , designed to cover the last optical window of oh - airglow centered at 9755  with @xmath40  corresponding to ly@xmath1 emission at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the design and fabrication of such a narrowband filter was not a simple issue for suprime - cam that uses a fast converging f/1.83 beam whose incident angle varies with a position in the field of view .",
    "mixture of such light with different incident angles severely degrades the resultant transmission characteristics of the narrowband filter from our target design . to obtain the desired performance complying with the filter specification for our scientific requirement , we employed a combination of the following three filters glued together : a color cut glass filter rg780 with anti - reflection coating , a narrow bandpass multi - layer coating filter , and another multi - layer coating filter for red leak prevention .",
    "one year before starting the manufacturing of the nb973 filter for suprime - cam , we made another filter nb980 ( bandwidth of @xmath41  centered at @xmath42 ) for use in the parallel beam section of the faint object camera and spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* focas ) on subaru to demonstrate the feasibility of narrowband imaging at this last oh window . during this prefabrication of nb980 ,",
    "manufacturing errors in controlling the thickness of thin film layers were evaluated . the multilayer thin film coating design for nb973",
    "was then optimized so that the resulting transmitting properties are relatively robust to inevitable manufacturing errors to control the thickness of each thin layers .",
    "the measured transmission curve of the final nb973 filter actually used in the present survey as well as other filters used for color selection of @xmath0 lae candidates are shown in figure [ ms_bvriznbfilters_z7lae ] .",
    "our target sky region is sdf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , -27@xmath43(j2000 ) , @xmath44876 arcmin@xmath27 ) , a blank field in which @xmath4 and 6.6 lae surveys had been also carried out @xcite . deep broadband @xmath45 and narrowband nb816 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47120 ) and nb921 ( @xmath48 , @xmath47132 ) filter images were taken by the sdf project .",
    "all the images were convolved to have common seeing size of @xmath49 . limiting magnitudes in @xmath39 aperture at @xmath50",
    "are @xmath51 .",
    "transmissions of these filters including ccd quantum efficiency , reflection ratio of the telescope prime mirror , the correction for the prime focus optics and transmission to the atmosphere ( airmass @xmath52 ) are also shown in figure [ ms_bvriznbfilters_z7lae ] .    our nb973 image of the sdf was taken with suprime - cam mounted on the subaru telescope on 16 and 17 march 2005 .",
    "these two nights were photometric with good seeing of @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "the total integration time is 15 hours .",
    "we have reduced nb973 image frames using the software sdfred @xcite in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "the nb973 image frames were dithered in a similar way as the sdf project did for other wavebands when they were taken .",
    "the combined nb973 image removed the slight fringing caused by oh - airglow that appeared in some image frames .",
    "the loss of survey area due to this dithering is only @xmath445% .",
    "the seeing size of the combined image was @xmath55 and convolved to @xmath49 , which is the common seeing size of the images of other wavebands , for the purpose of photometry .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars feige34 and hz44 @xcite were imaged during the observation to calibrate the photometric zeropint of the stacked image , which is nb973@xmath56 .",
    "the limiting magnitude reached nb973@xmath57 at @xmath58 with 15 hour integration .",
    "after obtaining the stacked nb973 image , we conducted photometric analysis , making an object catalog .",
    "source detection and photometry were carried out with sextractor software version 2.2.2 @xcite .",
    "pixel size of the suprime - cam ccds is @xmath59 pixel@xmath32 .",
    "we considered an area larger than contiguous 5 pixels with a flux [ mag arcsec@xmath33 ] greater than @xmath61 to be an object .",
    "object detection was first made in the nb973 image and then photometry was done in the images of other wavebands using the double - imaging mode .",
    "@xmath39 diameter aperture magnitudes of detected objects were measured with mag@xmath62aper parameter while total magunitudes with mag@xmath62auto .",
    "low quality regions of ccds , bright stellar halos , saturated ccd blooming , and pixels of spiky abnormally high or low flux counts were masked in the sdf images of all wavebands , using the official program code provided by the sdf team @xcite .",
    "the final effective area of the sdf image is 876 arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "the comoving distance along the line - of - sight corresponding to the redshift range @xmath63 for laes covered by nb973 filter was 58 mpc .",
    "therefore , we have surveyed a total of @xmath64 mpc@xmath65 volume using nb973 image .",
    "then , the final object catalog was constructed , detecting 41,533 objects down to nb973@xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .      to understand how reliable our source detections are down to the limiting magnitude of nb973 @xmath66",
    ", we measured the detection completeness of our photometry with the nb973 image .",
    "first , all the objects that satisfy our source detection criterion were removed from the nb973 image using the sextractor .",
    "then , the starlist task in the artdata package of iraf was used to create a sample starlist of about 20,000 artificial objects with a random but uniform spatial and luminosity distributions ranging from nb973 @xmath67 to 25 mag .",
    "next , using the mkobject task of iraf , these artificial objects were spread over the nb973 image , avoiding the masked regions of the sdf and the locations close to the previously removed real objects with the distance shorter than 3/2 of their fwhms .",
    "after this , sextractor was run for the source detection in exactly the same way as our actual photometry .",
    "finally , we calculated the ratios of the number of detected artificial objects to that of created ones to obtain the detection completeness .",
    "we repeated this procedure five times and averaged the obtained completeness .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ ms_ave_nb973_completeness ] .",
    "the completeness at our detection limit of nb973 @xmath2 is @xmath68% .",
    "the completeness was corrected when the number and luminosity densities of @xmath0 laes were calculated in the [ re - and - galev ] .",
    "we evaluated the completeness in the same way as @xcite and @xcite did for the detection completeness of @xmath4 and @xmath6 laes to keep consistency .",
    "however , in real life , some @xmath0 galaxies will lie behind brighter sources at lower redshifts and thus the completeness correction will be artificially small .",
    "the fractions that do can be included in the completeness estimate by simply adding artificial sources to the original image without masking out anything and without any exclusion zones in the placement of artificial sources .",
    "we also calculated our detection completeness in this way to see how much it is different from the original completeness evaluation . as expected , the completeness we calculated this time is slightly smaller .",
    "however , the difference is a factor of only 1.11.3 over nb973 @xmath6725 and it does not change the evaluation of lae number and luminosity densities much . hence , for our consequent analyses , we use the original completesess calculated in the same way as done for @xmath4 and @xmath69 laes to keep consistency .      to isolate @xmath0 laes from other objects",
    ", we investigated their expected colors and derived candidate selection criteria .",
    "we generated model spectra of laes at the redshift ranging from @xmath70 to 7 with rest frame ly@xmath1 line equivalent width @xmath71 varying from 0 to 300  as follows .",
    "first , we created a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a starburst galaxy using a stellar population synthesis model , galaxev @xcite with a metallicity of @xmath72 , an age of @xmath73 gyr , salpeter initial mass function with lower and upper mass cutoffs of @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath75 and exponentially decaying star formation history for @xmath77 gyr . these parameters were chosen to be the same as those used to generate model @xmath6 laes in @xcite to keep consistency .",
    "although recent observational studies show that laes seem to be much younger than the 1 gyr age and/or 1 gyr star formation decay time and @xmath78 laes seem to have dust extinction @xcite , we did not consider the effects of dust on the sed since the two issues have opposite effects on the broadband colors of the laes and this does not have a major effect on the lae selection criteria .",
    "then , the sed was redshifted to each of @xmath79 , 5.5 , 5.7 , ... , and 7.0 , and ly@xmath1 absorption by igm was applied to it , using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "finally , flux of a ly@xmath1 emission line with either of @xmath80 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 or 300  was added to the sed at @xmath811216 .",
    "we did not assume any specific line profile or velocity dispersion of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "instead , we simply added 1/2 of the total line flux value , assuming that the blue half of the ly@xmath1 line is absorbed by igm .",
    "an example of a model spectrum of a @xmath0 lae is shown in figure [ ms_bvriznbfilters_z7lae ] .",
    "colors of these model laes were calculated using their seds and transmission curves of suprime - cam broadband and nb973 filters and plotted in a two - color diagram of @xmath82nb973 vs. @xmath83 shown in figure [ ms_2color_diagram ] . as clearly seen in the diagram",
    ", a @xmath0 lae is expected to produce significant flux excess in nb973 against @xmath84 .",
    "however , it should be also noted that nb973 bandpass overlaps with the wavelength range at the longward edge of @xmath84 band .",
    "this allows laes and lbgs at even lower redshifts @xmath856.8 to cause the nb973 flux excess with respect to @xmath84 band if such galaxies have bright and steep uv continua .",
    "actually , such objects were detected in our photometry .",
    "their images and photometric properties are shown and described in figure [ ms_poststamp_iok1 - 5 ] and [ nb973_excess_obs ] . out of these lower redshift galaxies ,",
    "@xmath696.6 laes can be removed by requiring no detection in the narrowband filter nb921 image whose bandpass corresponds to the ly@xmath1 emissions at this redshift range @xcite .",
    "hence , we classified nb973-excess objects with nb973 @xmath66 ( @xmath58 , @xmath39 aperture ) , which include our target @xmath0 lae , into following two categories based on @xmath82 nb973 color .    * @xmath867.1 laes : @xmath87 , nb816 , @xmath84 , nb921 @xmath88 * @xmath897.1 lbgs : @xmath90 , nb816 , nb921 @xmath88 , @xmath91 , @xmath82 nb973 @xmath92    where @xmath87 , nb816 , @xmath84 and nb921 fluxes were measured in total magnitudes while @xmath83 and @xmath82nb973 colors in @xmath39 aperture magnitudes .",
    "all the @xmath93 and @xmath84 aperture magnitudes fainter than 27.87 and 27.06 ( @xmath61 limits ) , respectively , were replaced by these values in the application of criterion ( 2 ) .",
    "since the flux of a lae shortward of ly@xmath1 emission should be absorbed by igm , no detections ( @xmath88 ) in @xmath90 , nb816 and nb921 with either red @xmath91 color or no detections in @xmath93 and @xmath84 were imposed as a part of the criteria .",
    "this can help eliminate interlopers such as l / m / t type dwarf stars and lower redshift galaxies with other type of emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath94 , [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , h@xmath1 , [ sii ] and so on ) .",
    "also , criterion ( 1 ) implies that the robust @xmath0 lae candidates should show significant excess in nb973 over @xmath84 and nb921 , @xmath95 nb973 @xmath96 and nb921 @xmath97 nb973 @xmath98 .",
    "note that the color selection criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are slightly different from those in @xcite in that this time we include null detections in nb816 and nb921 whose bandpasses correspond to ly@xmath1 emission at @xmath995.75 and 6.56.6 , respectively , to make the criteria more reliable and secure .",
    "in fact , the object iok-3 detected by @xcite satisfied the criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) simultaneously except for nb921 @xmath100 and was spectroscopically identified as a @xmath6 lae by @xcite .",
    "this time , we found only one object satisfying criterion ( 1 ) ( hereafter referred to as iok-1 as in @xcite ) and none met criterion ( 2 ) . in order not to miss faint and diffuse @xmath0 laes such as ly@xmath1 blobs",
    "having extended shapes with fairly bright cores but nb973 @xmath101 ( @xmath39 aperture mag . )",
    ", we also loosened our detection limit cutoff adopting nb973 @xmath66 ( total mag . ) as another limiting magnitude .",
    "this increased the number of objects satisfying criterion ( 1 ) by 17 while still no objects fell into ( 2 ) .",
    "however , this sample might be contaminated by some spurious objects such as sky residuals and noise due to fringing that might not be removed perfectly at the time of image reduction .",
    "hence , we visually inspected all the broadband and narrowband images of each color - selected object and only kept those appearing to have condensed and relatively bright cores and excluded those having only diffuse faint shapes with no cores .",
    "more specifically , we removed objects that look apparently artificial such as connected bad pixels , tails of saturated pixels from bright stars and noises of discrete dismembered shapes or pieces of disconnected pixels with fairly large fluxes .",
    "as a result , we were left with one object ( hereafter called iok-2 as in @xcite ) .",
    "the images of iok-1 and -2 and their photometric properties are shown in figure [ ms_poststamp_iok1 - 5 ] and table [ photo - property ] , respectively . the color - magnitude diagram ( @xmath82 nb973 vs. nb973 ) of iok-1",
    "to -2 as well as all the objects detected down to nb973 @xmath102 ( total mag . )",
    "is plotted in figure [ ms_cmd ] .",
    "their two - color diagram is also shown in figure [ ms_2color_diagram ] .",
    "as @xcite did in selecting out their candidate @xmath6 laes in order not to miss faint targets , we also investigated the possibility of objects with a weak excess of @xmath103 nb973 @xmath104 being @xmath0 laes even though such objects do not have the expected colors of @xmath0 laes predicted by the stellar populationin synthesis model in [ color_criteria ] and figure [ ms_2color_diagram ] .",
    "we define the color criterion of such weak nb973-excess objects as :    * @xmath105 , @xmath91 , @xmath106 nb973 @xmath107    as mentioned in [ color_criteria ] , our nb973 is located at the red edge of @xmath84 band .",
    "this could cause the criterion ( 3 ) to pick up interlopers such as @xmath856.8 laes / lbgs ( as figure [ ms_2color_diagram ] predicts ) , @xmath1083 extremely red objects ( eros ) whose continua have the rest frame 4000  balmer breaks that result in the nb973-excess against @xmath84 or m / l / t type red cool dwarf stars whose seds can have steep slopes at around nb973 bandpass .",
    "such objects should be distinguished from @xmath0 laes if they are detected in nb973 as well as @xmath84 . from the photometry alone",
    ", it is difficult to tell if the criterion ( 3 ) objects are eros or dwarfs .",
    "however , it is possible to say whether the objects are galaxies at @xmath0 or not , which is more important in our study .    according to the predicted colors of model galaxies in figure [ ms_2color_diagram ] , the criterion ( 3 ) should select out @xmath856.8 laes / lbgs , not @xmath0 ones .",
    "however , as some of @xmath4 laes spectroscopically identified by @xcite , though not so many , do not satisfy their color selection criteria computed using sed models , objects satisfying our criterion ( 3 ) , which reside near the border of criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , could be @xmath0 laes .",
    "we found two objects to fall into criterion ( 3 ) ( hereafter , referred as to obj-4 , the brighter of the two in @xmath39 aperture nb973 mag . , and obj-5 ) .",
    "their colors , images and photometric properties are shown in figures [ ms_2color_diagram ] , [ ms_poststamp_iok1 - 5 ] , [ ms_cmd ] and table [ photo - property ] .",
    "if they are laes , their redshifts can be further constrained by using nb816 and nb921 images .",
    "as seen in figure [ ms_poststamp_iok1 - 5 ] , obj-4 is detected in @xmath93 , nb816 , @xmath84 , and nb921 as well as nb973 but does not show any significant excess in nb816 against @xmath93 and in nb921 with respect to @xmath84 although it displays nb973-excess greater than @xmath50 against @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , it is neither a @xmath995.75 lae nor @xmath696.6 one . since it is clearly detected in nb816 , which is the waveband well shortward of @xmath897 ly@xmath1 emission , obj-4 could be a @xmath856.4 lae or lbg .",
    "on the other hand , obj-5 is detected in @xmath84 and nb921 as well as nb973 but does not show significant excess in nb921 with respect to @xmath84 and thus is not a @xmath696.6 lae . also , detection in nb921 rules out the possibility of @xmath897 laes since their fluxes shortward of ly@xmath1 should be close to zero .",
    "though it displays an excess of @xmath82 nb973 @xmath107 , its @xmath83 color is very similar to that of a @xmath109 lae , which is predicted not to produce any nb973-excess .",
    "however , it is not detected in nb816 image and thus not a @xmath109 lae .",
    "hence , obj-5 could be a lae or lbg at @xmath856.4 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , obj-4 and -5 can be eros or dwarfs .",
    "however , we have confirmed that all the objects with weak ( @xmath107 ) nb973-excesses ( i.e. , obj-4 and -5 ) can not be @xmath0 laes and thus do not have to care anymore about the possibility of missing any faint @xmath0 lae candidates .",
    "as the selection criterion ( 1 ) derived in [ color_criteria ] shows , the most probable @xmath0 lae candidates are imaged in only nb973 waveband and not detected in any of other filters . since the nb973 image was taken 12 years after the @xmath45 images of the sdf had been obtained , the sources only bright in nb973 can be some variable objects such as supernovea and active galactic neuclei ( agns ) that accidentally increased their luminosities during our nb973 imaging observation .",
    "therefore , we investigated how many objects can be such variables . in another word , this corresponds to the number of the objects that were fainter than our detection limit nb973 @xmath2 @xmath110 at some epoch but that can become brigher than it at another epoch .",
    "since there are no enough data in @xmath84 and nb973 bands for the statistic of variables , we instead used @xmath93 band images taken over several separate epochs @xcite for the best possible ( but somewhat rough ) estimation we can do .",
    "first , we calculated the mean color of @xmath111 nb973 over the range of nb973 @xmath112 2225 , which is @xmath113 nb973@xmath114 , for the purpose of rough conversion of nb973 into @xmath93 magnitude . using it , nb973 @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "since the detection limit of sdf @xmath93 band image ( @xmath116 26.85 in @xmath58 ) is firmly deeper , the number count of objects fainter than our nb973 detection limit corresponding to @xmath117 can be securely obtained down to @xmath116 26.85 .",
    "the number count per 0.5 mag bin as well as the magnitude increments needed to exceed nb973 @xmath2 in brightness to be detected in nb973 are shown in table [ n_vs_i ] . since we were extrapolating the object number counts in nb973 down to nb973 @xmath118 using @xmath93 band object number counts down to @xmath119 @xmath110 and @xmath113 nb973@xmath114 , we also checked how similar the number counts in nb973 and in @xmath120 are to each other as shown in figure [ ms_i_ncount ] and table [ n_vs_nb973_or_i ] .",
    "since @xmath120 number counts are slightly larger ( by a factor of @xmath1211.2 per bin ) , our calculation of the number of variables can be only a little overestimation .",
    "note that the detection completeness of @xmath93 and nb973 are not corrected in their number counts .",
    "this can be the cause of the smaller counts in nb973 than @xmath93 toward our detection limit nb973 @xmath2 .",
    "we use in our calculation four @xmath93 images of a part of sdf ( @xmath122% of the total area ) taken at four separate epochs : 4 march 2005 , 30 april 2003 , 11 april 2002 and 24 april 2001 , respectively @xcite . the numbers of variable objects @xmath123 that increased their @xmath93 magnitudes by @xmath124 over the periods 20032005 and 20012002 were counted in each magnitude @xmath124 bin ( matched to @xmath125 bin in table [ n_vs_i ] ) as shown in table [ n_variables ] . in the 2003 and 2005 images , @xmath126 and 80,000 objects were detected down to their limiting magnitudes @xmath127 and 26.6 ( @xmath58 , @xmath39 aperture ) , respectively .",

    "thus , taking the averages , we roughly assumed that @xmath130 and 60,000 objects were detected in 20032005 and 20012002 , respectively and divided the number of variables @xmath123 by these numbers @xmath131 to obtain the probabilities @xmath132 of finding the variables with a brightness increase of @xmath133 in the sdf down to our detection limit .",
    "finally , multiplying the probability by the number counts of @xmath93-detected objects @xmath134 in table [ n_vs_i ] and summing all them up , the number of variables that became brighter than nb973 @xmath2 came out to be @xmath13510 .",
    "note that since the magnitude increse of @xmath136 is really small change and can not be distinguished from photometric errors in nb973 and @xmath93 magnitude measurements , which is also in the order of up to @xmath137 , we ignored the number of variables in @xmath1380.1 bin at the time of the summation .",
    "so far , we have considered only the data of the variables that increased their magnitudes over the two epochs and did not treat those having decreased their magnitudes .",
    "if we roughly assume that their numbers are approximately the same , the number of possible variables could be about one half of that we estimated above , which is @xmath1395 .",
    "again , this number might be a little overestimation by a factor of @xmath1401.2 since we for our extrapolation used @xmath93 band number count instead of nb973 one , which is smaller as seen in figure [ ms_i_ncount ] and table [ n_vs_nb973_or_i ] . correcting for this factor",

    "this result indicates that the extremely weak emission - like flux at 9750  seen in 3 hours stacked spectrum made from 2005 and 2006 frames is spurious .    to see if our 11 hours spectroscopy has reached the depth required to detect a ly@xmath1 emission , we compare the sky background rms of the stacked spectrum with the ly@xmath1 flux calculated from nb973 magnitude of the iok-2 . if we assume all of the flux in nb973 comes from the ly@xmath1 line at @xmath0 and adopt the total magnitude of nb973 @xmath165 rather than @xmath39 aperture one , we obtain the line flux of @xmath166 erg s@xmath32 cm@xmath33 . on the other hand , binning of 4 pixels ( corresponding to 0.017mpc at @xmath0 ) in the spatial direction",

    "similarly , the @xmath21-dependence of @xmath244 , @xmath254 mag , predicts @xmath276 for @xmath277 and thus @xmath278 due to lae galaxy evolution from @xmath6 to 5.7 .",
    "however , @xcite found that the ly@xmath1 lf declines in such a way that @xmath2790.6 ) from @xmath4 to 6.6 , regarding their photometric and spectroscopic lfs as the upper and lower limits of @xmath6 ly@xmath1 lf , respectively .",
    "hence , the attenuation of ly@xmath1 photons by the neutral igm at @xmath6 is @xmath2800.88 .",
    "the decrease in ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath4 to 6.6 and 7 can not be explained only by the evolution of laes inferred from that of lbgs .",
    "this result implies that the remaining deficits could come from the attenuation of ly@xmath1 lines by neutral igm .",
    "if this is the case , ly@xmath1 line tends to be more attenuated at higher redshift as @xmath2810.88 at @xmath6 and @xmath282 at @xmath0 , implying that the neutral igm fraction , @xmath272 increases with redshift beyond @xmath184 as derived in [ neutral - igm ] .",
    "however , note that this result is based on the assumption that laes evolve in the same way as lbgs do",
    ". this might not be necessarily true .",
    "although the laes are believed to be closely related to lbgs and many of candidate lbgs at high redshift have been identified as laes by spectroscopy , the link between these two populations has not been clearly understood yet and they might have followed different evolutionary histories .      in the previous sections , we tried to estimate the intrinsic evolution of ly@xmath1 lf of laes from uvlf evolution of laes and lbgs , with an implicit assumption that the evolutions of ly@xmath1 and uv luminosities are similar to each other .",
    "however , this assumption may not be true in reality , and hence our argument will be strengthened if we can show that these are indeed similar in a realistic theoretical model of laes .    for this purpose , we use a recent model for lae evolution constructed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k07 ) .",
    "this model is an extension of one of the latest hierarchical clustering models of galaxy formation @xcite , in which the merger histories of dark matter haloes are modeled based on structure formation theory and star formation processes in dark haloes are calculated to predict the photometric properties of galaxies .",
    "this model can reproduce most of the observations for photometric , kinematic , structural , and chemical properties of local galaxies , as well as high-@xmath21 lbgs @xcite .",
    "k07 extended this model without changing the original model parameters , but introducing new modeling only for the escape fraction of ly@xmath1 photons ( @xmath283 ) from galaxies based on physical considerations .",
    "specifically , the dust extinction of ly@xmath1 photons and effect of galaxy - scale outflow are newly taken into account .",
    "this is the first model for laes based on a hierarchical galaxy formation model in which @xmath284 is not a universal constant but depends on physical conditions of galaxies .",
    "this model can reproduce the observed ly@xmath1 lf of laes in @xmath285 36 , and predicts that galaxies under strong galaxy scale outflow with @xmath286 are dominant in the bright - end of ly@xmath1 lfs , which is also consistent with observations .",
    "it should be noted here that @xmath287 in the k07 model could vary from galaxy to galaxy and may evolve within a galaxy , and hence even if the ly@xmath1 photon production rate is proportional to star formation rate , the evolutions of ly@xmath1 and uv lfs could be different from each other .",
    "the k07 predictions of the ly@xmath1 and uv lfs of laes at @xmath288 and @xmath289 assuming @xmath290 are presented in figure [ ms_kobayashi - lyalfs ] and [ ms_uvlf ] , respectively .",
    "the evolutions of number density and ly@xmath1 luminosity density of laes with a threshold ly@xmath1 luminosity predicted by this model are shown figure [ ms_madau_plot ] . as demonstrated in k07 ,",
    "the deficit of the observed laes compared with the model prediction of ly@xmath1 lf is clear at @xmath189 as seen in figure [ ms_kobayashi - lyalfs ] while this model precisely reproduces the observed evolution at @xmath29136 . on the other hand ,",
    "the degree of evolution of uvlf of laes predicted by the model is similar to that observed in the same redshift range .",
    "the fact that the model prediction is consistent with the uvlf evolution but not with the ly@xmath1 lf evolution then implies that the evolution of the observed ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath292 could be caused by the igm absorption .",
    "the discrepancy can be resolved if we adopt a simple prescription of luminosity - independent igm transmission : @xmath2930.78 at @xmath6 and @xmath2940.64 at @xmath0 .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that the evolution of ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath189 could be likely a result of ly@xmath1 photon absorption by neutral igm , implying a significant evolution of the igm neutral fraction beyond @xmath189 . in order to obtain some quantitative implications for reionization",
    ", however , we must translate the estimates of @xmath295 obtained in the previous section into the igm neutral fraction , @xmath296 .",
    "this procedure is not straightforward because this translation is generally model dependent ( e.g. , santos 2004 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2007 ) .    here",
    ", we apply the dynamic model with a reasonable velocity shift of ly@xmath1 line by @xmath297 redward of the systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "the attenuation factor of ly@xmath1 luminosity is given as a function of @xmath272 , and the reason for the choice of this model is that this model predicts no attenuation when @xmath298 .",
    "note that some other models of santos ( 2004 ) predict a significant attenuation even in the case of @xmath273 , due to the neutral gas associated with the host haloes of laes . choosing this particular model",
    "then means that we ascribe the evolution of the ly@xmath1 lf at @xmath189 only to the absorption by pure igm .",
    "we consider that this is a reasonable assumption , since observations indicate that the escape fraction of ly@xmath1 photons is about unity at least for laes at @xmath299 @xcite .",
    "if laes at @xmath300 are a similar population to the low-@xmath21 laes , we do not expect significant absorption by neutral gas physically associated to laes . on the other hand ,",
    "it should also be kept in mind that if @xmath23 laes are surrounded by a significant amount of nearby neutral gas that is not present for low-@xmath21 laes , the estimate of @xmath272 as an average of igm in the universe could become lower than those derived here .    in section [ uvlf - yoshida ]",
    ", we obtained @xmath3010.88 and @xmath282 at @xmath6 and 7.0 , respectively .",
    "application of @xcite model yields the neutral fractions of @xmath3020.42 and @xmath3030.54 .",
    "if we use the k07 model in section [ model_galevol ] to estimate @xmath272 , we find @xmath3040.36 from @xmath3050.78 at @xmath6 , and @xmath3060.64 from @xmath3070.64 at @xmath308 .",
    "the neutral fraction @xmath272 at @xmath6 and 7 estimated from two independent methods are consistent with each other and tends to increase with redshift at @xmath309 .",
    "these series of @xmath272 values at @xmath6 and 7 , combined with @xmath3100.04 and @xmath120.6 derived from quasar gp tests and grb spectral analysis @xcite , supports the picture that the reionization completed at @xmath184 , beyond which it was still in progress with larger neutral fraction of igm hydrogen , which evolved with redshift .",
    "the neutral igm fractions obtained by independent methods are summerized in table [ neutral_frction ] .",
    "however , our constraint suggests that the neutral igm persists at the @xmath311% level as late as @xmath0 and would contradict the _ wmap _",
    "conclusion that the reionization epoch was @xmath312 at the @xmath313% confidence level .",
    "our results could be reconciled with _",
    "wmap _ only if there is a statistical fluke ( one time in 20 , a 95% confidence range is wrong ) or the reionization happened twice ( e.g. , cen 2003 ) so that a lot of the observed electron scattering happens at @xmath314 , and then the universe becomes partially neutral again , allowing us to observe neutral gas at @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we again emphasize that these quantitative results are model - dependent and should be interpreted with caution .",
    "however , the decrease in the ly@xmath1 lf of laes beyond @xmath7 is more significant than expected from uvlf evolution or a theoretical model , and hence the physical status of igm might be changing at @xmath189 .",
    "we have conducted a narrowband nb973 survey of @xmath0 laes , established color criteria to select out @xmath0 laes , and found two candidates down to @xmath315 erg s@xmath32 ( 5@xmath316 ) . by follow - up",
    "spectroscopy , the brighter of the two was indentified as a @xmath3 lae while we can confirm neither ly@xmath1 emission nor any other features in the spectrum of the other candidate despite the sufficiently long integration time .",
    "the number and ly@xmath1 luminosity densities at @xmath0 obtained by this study were compared to those at @xmath4 and 6.6 derived from the latest samples obtained by the sdf surveys @xcite down to our detection limit , and clear evolution of density deficits with increasing redshifts was observed such that : @xmath223 and @xmath317 ; @xmath225 and @xmath226 . if we assume that the lae population does not evolve from @xmath0 to 5.7 , this series of density deficits could reflect an increase in neutral igm hydrogen with redshifts beyond @xmath180 .    to see",
    "if lae evolves from @xmath0 to 6.6 , we also compared uvlf of @xmath0 lae with those of @xmath4 and 6.6 laes derived from the sdf lae surveys .",
    "no decrease in the number density of uvlf was observed from @xmath4 through 6.6 to 7 .",
    "since the uv photons are not attenuated by neutral igm and the uvlf is only sensitive to galaxy evolution , our result suggests that the deficits in @xmath190 and @xmath191 might reflect the cosmic reionization and the lae population does not significantly evolve at @xmath47 .",
    "however , the uvlf at @xmath0 suffers from small statistics at this time and the interpretation is not robust .",
    "hence , the amount by which the lae evolution affects the density deficits among @xmath0 , 6.6 and 5.7 were investigated by the inference from uvlfs of @xmath318 lbgs @xcite based on the assumption that laes would have evolved in the same way as lbgs and ly@xmath1 line luminosities of laes are proportional to their uv continuum luminosities . even after the galaxy evolution was taken into account",
    ", there still remained some density deficits among these epochs .",
    "if we attribute the deficits to the attenuation of ly@xmath1 photons by the neutral igms , the neutral fractions of the universe at @xmath6 and 7 are estimated to be 0.120.42 and 0.120.54 , respectively .",
    "this result , combined with neutral fractions derived from @xmath180 quasars and a @xmath10 grb , supports the completion of the reionization at @xmath180 and the possible evolution of neutral igm beyond this redshift .",
    "again , this result is based on the assumption that laes would have evolved in the same way as lbgs , which might not be necessarily true .",
    "therefore , we furthermore used a lae evolution model ( k07 model ) constructed from hierarchical clustering scenario to reproduce ly@xmath1 lfs at @xmath4 , 6.6 and 7 in the case of transparent igm ( @xmath273 ) and compared with ly@xmath1 lfs obtained by the latest sdf surveys @xcite .",
    "the observed data at @xmath6 and 7 showed smaller number and luminosity densities than those predicted by the model , suggesting that there still remains the possibility of the incomplete reionization at those epochs .",
    "the neutral fractions at @xmath6 and 7 estimated from the decline of the lfs by the reionization factors alone after the galaxy evolution effects had been corrected are @xmath3190.36 and @xmath3200.64 , respectively , also consistent with quasar and grb results .",
    "the results regarding @xmath0 lae presented here are based on relatively shallow depth of nb973 imaging , small sample statistics , and only the sdf and optical imaging data . from these data alone , the trend of the density deficit between @xmath4 and 7 in fainter lae populations and in other places in the universe , changes in physical properties of laes associated with their evolution between these epochs , and typical spectroscopic properties of @xmath0 laes such as the direct detection of the attenuation of ly@xmath1 line can not be inferred .",
    "also , the calculation of the uv continuum flux and thus uvlf is dependent on relatively rough estimation without infrared data .",
    "deeper nb973 imaging of the sdf as well as other fields for which infrared images are available and follow - up spectroscopy of newly detected lae candidates will provide the answers and more precise results in future studies .",
    "we greatly appreciate the technology and engineers of asahi spectra co. , ltd .  for developing the nb973 filter that led us to the discovery of the @xmath3 lae .",
    "we are deeply grateful to the staff at the subaru telescope for their kind supports to make our observations successful .",
    "we express the gratitude to the sdf team for obtaining and providing us with invaluable imaging data .",

    "<S> we made a narrowband nb973 ( bandwidth of 200  centered at 9755 ) imaging of the subaru deep field ( sdf ) and found two @xmath0 ly@xmath1 emitter ( lae ) candidates down to nb973 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> carrying out deep follow - up spectroscopy , we identified one of them as a real @xmath3 lae . </S>",
    "<S> this has established a new redshift record , showing that galaxy formation was in progress just 750 myr after the big bang . meanwhile </S>",
    "<S> , the ly@xmath1 line luminosity function of laes is known to decline from @xmath4 to 6.6 in the sdf . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 at @xmath6 is 4060% of that at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that the number density of @xmath0 lae is even only 17% of the density at @xmath6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples . </S>",
    "<S> this series of significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be the result of galaxy evolution during these epochs . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the uv continuum luminosity functions of laes , those of lyman break galaxies and a lae evolution model based on hierarchical clustering , we find that galaxy evolution alone can not explain all the decrease in density . </S>",
    "<S> this extra density deficit might reflect the attenuation of the ly@xmath1 photons from laes by the neutral hydrogen possibly left at the last stage of the cosmic reionization at @xmath77 . </S>"
