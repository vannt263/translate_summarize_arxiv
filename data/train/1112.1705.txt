    "using the bc model , we follow l06 to construct the composite w1 luminosity functions ( lfs ) in observer s frame in five redshift bins . for each bin , we calculate the mean redshift of the clusters @xmath38 , and adjust the @xmath32-correction and distance modulus of individual clusters to best represent how the clusters would appear if they were all at @xmath38 .",

    "for the two higher redshift bins , the observed @xmath36 is about 0.3 mag brighter than the model . to check",
    "if this is resulted from the blending of galaxies due to the large psf of wise , we also construct composite lfs in the sdss @xmath20-band and w1 for a sample of @xmath39 optically - selected clusters and groups located in sdss stripe 82 , using the catalog of ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : mstarev ] , along with the bc model predictions .",
    "although the measured @xmath36 of the sdss clusters are slightly fainter than the predictions , the general agreement of @xmath36 in both w1 and @xmath20-band with the models indicates that blending is not the cause of the @xmath36 being brighter than the models for our x - ray cluster sample at @xmath40 .",
    "the galaxies in our x - ray clusters are indeed more luminous on average than those in the sdss optical clusters ; for example , the mean difference of the magnitudes of the brightest cluster galaxies between the two samples is about 1 mag .",
    "this is not surprising given that our clusters are more massive than the g11 sample on average ( see e.g. , l04 , @xcite ) . with the chosen bc model ,",
    "our evolving @xmath41 flux threshold ( see below ) corresponds to a constant galaxy stellar mass limit of @xmath42 . for this reason , and for sake of consistency",
    ", we will use the bc model for the @xmath32-correction and @xmath36 evolution , but will comment below on the impact of the `` brightening '' of galaxies in @xmath43 clusters on our results .",
    "for each cluster , we sum the fluxes from objects brighter than the smaller of @xmath44 and w1@xmath45 , and subtract fluxes from similar objects located within the background annulus ( scaled by the relative area of the annulus and cluster region ) . assuming all clusters have the same shape of lf ( with a faint - end power - law slope @xmath46 ) , which is consistent with our data ( see also l06 )",

    "for reference , at @xmath49 we have @xmath50 .    for our @xmath19 clusters , we measure the total luminosity in the @xmath21-band using 2mass data ( following l04 ) ; again @xmath51 , using the @xmath21-band @xmath52 from the same bc model .",
    "our stellar mass estimates are consistent with that listed in @xcite , and are similar to that of @xcite and @xcite , when the intracluster light ( icl ) contribution is excluded from the latter study . for a few clusters at @xmath19 we have also used wise data to estimate @xmath5 , and found agreement with 2mass - based values to within 10% .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : allcls ] we show the @xmath5@xmath4 correlation , measured within @xmath1 , for the m08 clusters ( filled circles ) , v09 clusters ( open points ) , and @xmath19 clusters ( green squares ) .",
    "the m08 and v09 samples , although constructed using different selection criteria , appear to follow the same trend .",
    "together the sample spans a factor of 30 in @xmath53 , allowing us to determine the slope of scaling relations well .",
    "the correlations between the baryon components and the cluster mass are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fb ] .",
    "the lower sets of points are the stellar mass fraction ( @xmath54 ) , and the upper sets are the baryon fraction , @xmath55 , which is dominated by the icm .    to investigate any redshift evolution among these correlations , we fit the data with the following form by @xmath56 minimization , taking into account the uncertainties in both mass measurements : @xmath57 we find that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "that is , there is no evolution for the @xmath5@xmath15 relation , weak suggestion of evolution in @xmath64@xmath53 , and strong evidence of evolution in @xmath4@xmath15 , which is manifested as an offset between the loci of @xmath65 for @xmath19 ( solid squares ) and @xmath7 ( circles ) clusters in fig .",
    "[ fig : fb ] .",
    "this is mainly due to the self - similar evolution ( sse ) of the icm , as noted first by v09 ( see the discussion associated with fig .  10 therein ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath66 , where @xmath67 based on our data . introducing the nonlinear mass scale , @xmath68 ,",
    "satisfying @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the _ rms _ fluctuation of linear power spectrum and @xmath71 is the growth factor @xcite , we can expect the icm mass fraction to be the same for systems of the same @xmath72 at different redshifts under the sse .",
    "it then follows that @xmath73 .",
    "we note that @xmath74 is consistent with @xmath75 up to @xmath76 or so .",
    "indeed , with total mass scaled by @xmath68 , the scatter reduces from 12% to 8% .",
    "we have confirmed the consistency between the observed @xmath4@xmath15 evolution and the sse expectation by repeating the above analysis using @xmath15 based on the @xmath17@xmath15 relation of v09 .    using all of the clusters we find that @xmath77 with a scatter of 31% ; without strong evidence of evolution , for simplicity we take @xmath78 in eqn .",
    "[ eq:3eq ] and find that @xmath79 with a scatter of 31% .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath80 is the most important systematic uncertainty in our results .",
    "we adopt the kroupa imf , as it gives @xmath80 at @xmath81 that is consistent with the sauron measurements of nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "using the salpeter ( chabrier ) imf , our @xmath5 would be 34% higher ( 24% lower ) .",
    "using a single value of @xmath80 for all galaxies in a cluster is admittedly too simplistic @xcite , although we note the spread of @xmath80 in w1 for galaxies of all types is 20% smaller than in optical bands .",
    "furthermore , as galaxies in the @xmath82 magnitude range contribute 65% of the total light , our approach is reasonable , as long as @xmath80 is only a weak function of galaxy mass ( and/or morphology ) .",
    "another systematic uncertainty stems from the relative mass calibration of the @xmath16@xmath15 relation at different redshifts , which is about 5% between @xmath49 and @xmath83 ( v09 ) . by boosting the total and icm mass by 5% for all clusters at @xmath84",
    ", we find that the exponents @xmath85 and @xmath86 become more negative ( both change by @xmath87 ) , giving a weak hint of changing in the stellar mass content .",
    "if only using clusters at @xmath88 , we would have found that @xmath89 ( c.f .",
    "@xmath90 when using the whole sample ) .",
    "that is , the 17 highest-@xmath20 clusters have a substantial leverage on the determination of @xmath86 .",
    "it is also these clusters that exhibit `` brightening '' of galaxies with respect to the bc model .",
    "should we have adopted the measured @xmath36 based on these clusters ( instead of using the bc model ) , which is equivalent to reducing @xmath91 and adopting a higher galactic stellar mass limit , we would have obtained @xmath92 .",
    "we therefore acknowledge the possibility that our results may be driven by the behavior of these most massive clusters at @xmath93 .",
    "ideally we would use a large , volume - limited sample that may represent the average cluster properties better , which will be carried out in a future publication with the all - sky wise data .",
    "possible systematic effects aside , the apparent lack of redshift evolution in @xmath5@xmath15 relation is consistent with the findings of g09 and l06 . in analyses that utilize @xmath65 to infer cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the locally derived @xmath5@xmath15 relation is usually assumed to hold at higher redshifts .",
    "our result directly validates such an assmption .",
    "our results suggest that , within @xmath1 , the gas and galaxy contents evolve in different ways ; while gas mass grows according to the sse fashion , the much larger scatter in @xmath5@xmath15 and @xmath5@xmath4 , as well as the much - less - than - unity slopes in these scaling relations , suggest a more stochastic growth history , which likely involves tidal interactions to strip off material from galaxies ( e.g. , l04 , @xcite ) . in light of this , it would be critical to constrain the evolution of the stellar mass contained in the icl .",
