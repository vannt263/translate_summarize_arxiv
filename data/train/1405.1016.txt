    "it is frequently declared that only lower order formulae can be deduced for the effective conductivity problem which can not be analytically solved in general case because of the complicated random geometrical structures .",
    "after such an announce hard numerical computations are applied to solve such a problem . of course , advanced computational approaches can be useful in mechanical engineering .",
    "but an exact or approximate analytical formula is always better because it can exactly show asymptotic behavior near singular points when numerics usually fails .    in the present paper ,",
    "we deduce such a formula for a 2d , two - component composite made from a collection of non - overlapping , identical , circular discs , embedded randomly in an otherwise uniform locally isotropic host ( see fig.[figdisksrandom ] ) .",
    "the conductivity of the host is normalized to unity .",
    "the effective conductivity problem for an insulating or ideally conducting inclusions is called the conductivity and superconductivity problem , respectively @xcite .",
    "the problem and its approximate solution go back to maxwell , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are two important unresolved problems in the theory of random composites :    \\1 .",
    "what quantity should stand for the maximum volume fraction @xmath0 of random composites @xcite , and    \\2 .",
    "theoretical explanation of the values of critical indices for conductivity and superconductivity denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel technique for deriving expansions in concentration was suggested @xcite .",
    "it combines analytic and numeric methods for solving the conductivity problem directly in the 2d case .",
    "it is applicable both for regular @xcite and random cases .",
    "thus , we proceed to the case of a 2d random composite , where rather long series in concentration for the effective conductivity by itself , will be presented and analyzed systematically , following generally to @xcite .",
    "the series will be used to estimate the index and the threshold in 2d random case .",
    "the considered problem can be equivalently formulated as follows .",
    "given the polynomial approximation of the function @xmath3 , to estimate the convergence radius @xmath4 of the taylor series of @xmath3 , and to determine parameters of the asymptotically equivalent approximation near @xmath5 .",
    "the problem of defining the threshold is highly non - trivial , since the random closest packing of hard spheres turned out to be ill - defined , and can not stand for the maximum volume fraction .",
    "it depends on the protocol employed to produce the random packing as well as other system characteristics @xcite .",
    "the problem seems less acute in two dimensions , where various protocols seems to agree on what quantity should stand for the maximum volume fraction of random composites @xcite .",
    "namely it is the concentration of @xmath6 , attained only for the regular hexagonal array of disks . the sought value for a long time was thought to be close to @xmath7 , and considered as random close packing value @xcite .",
    "it was recognized recently , that it does not correspond to the maximally random jammed state @xcite . for volume fractions above @xmath7",
    "some local order is present and irregular packing is polycrystalline , forming rather large triangular coordination domains - grains . in present paper , a protocol with @xmath8",
    "is used , although our method can be applied with another protocol with unknown @xmath4 .    all attempts to explain the value of critical indices through geometrical quantities of percolation problem , i.e. universally @xcite , had failed so far and the indices are considered independent . from the phase interchange theorem",
    "@xcite it follows that in two - dimensions , the superconductivity index is equal to the conductivity index @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    while it is clear that using expansions in concentration for the conductivity , one should be able to address the two problems , in practice there are no more than two terms available for random systems @xcite , because of the serious technical difficulties .",
    "no method even such powerful as renormalization , or resummation approaches can draw reliable conclusions systemically , based on such short series @xcite . `` in fact , the age - old method of series expansions is also blocked by the same difficulties ... ' ' @xcite .",
    "this concerns also self consistent methods ( scms ) which include maxwell s approach , effective medium approximations , differential schemes etc .",
    "scms are valid only for dilute composites when the interactions between inclusions do not matter @xcite . the idea to correct a self consistent method ( scm ) result @xmath9 in all dimensions remained , therefore , theoretically unattainable ( see , nevertheless , @xcite ) .",
    "we should also mention an indirect approach to estimating @xmath1 for resistor networks from resistive susceptibility via scaling relations @xcite .",
    "this approach also dwells heavily on resummation techniques .",
    "in order to correctly define the effective conductivity tensor @xmath10 of random composites , the probabilistic distribution of disks of radius @xmath11 must be introduced , since already the second order term of @xmath10 in concentration depends on the distribution @xcite . for macroscopically",
    "isotropic composites , the third order term begins to depend on the distribution @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the uniform non - overlapping distribution when a set of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "points @xmath12 are located in the plane in such a way that @xmath13 .    for @xmath14",
    "we arrive at the poisson distribution and for the maximally possible concentration @xmath8 , the distribution degenerates to the unique location , the hexagonal array .",
    "the tensor @xmath10 is expressed through the scalar effective conductivity @xmath15 as follows @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unit tensor . in the present paper ,",
    "the numerical computations are performed only for the hexagonal representative cell .",
    "this assumption does not restrict our investigation since the number of inclusions per cell can be taken arbitrary large , hence , the shape of the cell does not impact on the final result .",
    "consider sufficiently large number of non - overlapping circular disks of radius @xmath11 with the centers @xmath18 .",
    "the formal definition of the random variable has to be statistically realized to get numerical results .",
    "the protocol for the data is based on the monte carlo simulations @xcite and can be shortly described as follows . at the beginning , the centers @xmath18 are located at the nodes of the regular hexagonal lattice and further randomly moved without overlapping .",
    "after sufficiently long random walks the centers form a statistical event satisfying the considered distribution . using these locations of disks we compute coefficients of @xmath15 in @xmath19 many times and take the average .",
    "detailed description of the computational method and all relevant parameters for simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the method yields @xmath20 since we are dealing with the limiting case of perfectly conducting inclusions when the conductivity of inclusions tends to infinity , the effective conductivity is also expected to tend to infinity as a power - law , as the concentration @xmath19 tends to the maximal value @xmath0 for the hexagonal array , @xmath21 the critical superconductivity index ( exponent ) @xmath2 believed to be close to @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "probably the simplest way to estimate the position of a critical point , is to apply the diagonal pade approximants @xcite , but their direct application leads to poorly convergent , practically random results , with the best estimate for the threshold @xmath25 .",

    "factor approximations of @xmath15 can be always represented as a product of two factors : critical part @xmath36 and of the rest , i.e. regular part @xmath37 .",
    "so one can most generally express the threshold @xmath38 the subsequent steps are described below .",
    "suppose we found explicitly the solution as a factor approximant @xcite , @xmath39 with approximate threshold value of @xmath40 .",
    "such approximant satisfy the three starting terms from ( [ seriesrand ] ) @xcite , and leads to the value of @xmath41 for the index within accepted bounds @xcite .",
    "let us look for another solution in the same form , but with an exact , yet unknown threshold @xmath42 , @xmath43 from here one can express formally , @xmath44 since @xmath45 is also unknown .",
    "all we can do is to use for @xmath46 the series ( [ seriesrand ] ) , so that instead of a true threshold , we have an effective threshold , @xmath47 which should become a true threshold @xmath42 as @xmath48 !",
    "moreover , let us apply re - summation procedure to the expansion ( [ series1 ] ) using again factor approximants @xmath49 , and define the sought threshold @xmath50 self - consistently , @xmath51 as we approach the threshold , the rhs of ( [ thr ] ) should become the threshold .",

    "similar techniques were applied also to the regular case @xcite . in the random case",
    "we proceed by extrapolating from the side of a diluted regime and to the high - concentration regime close to @xmath0 ; while in the regular case we first derived an approximation to the high - concentration regime and then extrapolated to the less concentrated regime . there are indications that physics of a 2d regular and irregular composites is related to the so - called `` necks '' , certain areas between closely spaced disks @xcite .",
    "we discuss briefly some formulae for the effective conductivity from @xcite .",
