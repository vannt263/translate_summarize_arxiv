    "they are symmetric about the galactic plane and the size is @xmath0 ( @xmath1  kpc ) .",
    "their surface brightness is relatively uniform , and they have sharp edges and hard spectrum @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed for the origin of the bubbles .",
    "these models assume that activities of the super - massive black hole ( smbh ) or starbursts at the gc created the bubbles .",
    "some models indicated that cosmic - rays ( cr ) that are accelerated via star formation activities are conveyed into the bubbles @xcite .",
    "others pointed out that the crs are originated from jets launched by the central black hole @xcite , or accelerated inside the bubbles @xcite .",
    "gamma - rays can be generated by interaction between cr protons and ambient gas ( hadronic models ) , or by inverse compton scattering by cr electrons ( leptonic models ) .    in this study",
    ", we treat the fermi bubbles as a scaled - up version of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "crs are accelerated at the forward shock front like snrs .",
    "we explicitly solve a diffusion - advection equation to study the evolution of cr distribution .",
    "we also focus on the reduction of the diffusion coefficient around the bubbles , which slows cr diffusion and is crucial to explain the sharp edge of the bubbles @xcite . the reduction has been indicated and studied for snrs @xcite ; it could be caused by a cr streaming instability or anisotropic diffusion .",
    "for the fermi bubbles , @xcite studied the reduction by the latter . in this study",
    ", we investigate the former .",
    "we refer to protons as crs unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume a spherically symmetric bubble , and mainly focus on the high - galactic - latitude part of the fermi bubbles ( large @xmath2 and small @xmath3 in the galactic coordinate ) . before the bubble is born , the gas in the galactic halo is static and has a distribution of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the gc , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the parameters .",
    "we assume that the adiabatic index of the gas is @xmath9 . for hydrodynamic evolution of the halo gas",
    ", we adopt the sedov - taylor solution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if an energy is injected at @xmath10 at the gc , the radius of the shock front of the bubble can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the injected energy .",
    "on the other hand , if the energy is continuously injected at a rate of @xmath14 at the gc , it should be @xmath15 we ignore the effect of cr pressure on the gas",
    ". we do not care about the energy source : it may be the smbh or starburst activities at the gc . if the gas has a finite temperature , the mach number of the shock gradually decreases as the velocity , @xmath16 , decreases .",
    "the gas density @xmath17 and velocity @xmath18 for @xmath19 follow the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "our cr model is based on the one in @xcite for the evolution of snrs . however , while we adopted a monte carlo approach in @xcite to calculate the cr distribution , in this study we explicitly solve a diffusion - advection equation to follow the evolution of a cr distribution function @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum of crs .",
    "the equation is @xmath22 p\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p } + q\\:,\\ ] ] where the source @xmath23 describes particle injection , and @xmath24 is the velocity of the waves that scatter crs .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the alfvn velocity , and that @xmath28 for @xmath19 because the waves would isotropically propagate for @xmath19 .",
    "crs are accelerated at the shock front of the bubble ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we do not consider the details of particle acceleration .",
    "crs are accelerated in the shock neighborhood , where some nonlinear effects generate strong magnetic waves or cause strong amplification of magnetic fields @xcite . in this region",
    ", particle diffusion would follow the so - called bohm diffusion and cr acceleration is effective .",
    "the spatial scale of the region is much smaller than @xmath30 and we ignore the width .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the parameter , and @xmath33 is the radius just outside the shock . at a strong shock",
    ", the standard diffusive shock acceleration model predicts that @xmath34 @xcite . for instant energy injection ( equation  ( [ eq : rs ] ) ) ,",
    "the coefficient is written as @xmath35 while for constant energy injection ( equation  ( [ eq : rsw ] ) ) , it is written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the light velocity , and @xmath38 is the proton mass .",
    "crs are accelerated and injected into the galactic halo space between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the total energy of the crs accelerated during that period .",
    "the maximum momentum @xmath42 is determined by the condition of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the acceleration time - scale and @xmath45 is the age of the bubble . in our case , @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the proton charge , @xmath49 is the background magnetic field , and @xmath50 is the gyro - factor @xcite .",
    "we assume that the shock is strong .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , we assume @xmath51 ( bohm diffusion ) . instead of equation  ( [ eq : pmax ] ) , @xmath52 is often determined by an escape condition for snrs @xcite .",
    "this is because the characteristic spatial length of particles penetrating into the shock upstream region can be comparable to the size of snrs @xcite .",
    "however , this can not be applied to the fermi bubbles , because the size of the bubbles is much larger than the characteristic length .",
    "we fix the minimum momentum at @xmath53 .",
    "the crs escaped from the shock neighborhood may amplify magnetic fluctuations ( alfvn waves ) in the galactic halo through a streaming instability @xcite . since crs are scattered by the fluctuations , the diffusion coefficient @xmath54 in equation  ( [ eq : diff ] ) is reduced . at the rest frame and outside the bubble ( @xmath55 ) , the wave growth is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the energy density of alfvn waves per unit logarithmic bandwidth ( which are resonant with particles of momentum @xmath21 ) relative to the ambient magnetic energy density @xmath58 @xcite , and @xmath59 is the particle velocity .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is simply given as @xmath60 within the bubble , the evolution of the waves could be complicated , because it could be controlled by something like turbulence .",
    "thus for @xmath19 , we simply assume that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a bohm - type diffusion coefficient @xcite , and @xmath63 for a strong shock .",
    "the results do not much depend on the diffusion coefficient inside the bubble if it is small enough .",
    "although there is no strong observational constraint on magnetic fields in the galactic halo , we assume that they are given by @xmath64 . for the value of @xmath65",

    "gamma - ray and neutrino fluxes created through hadronic interactions between cr protons and gas protons are calculated using the code provided by @xcite .",
    "we consider four models .",
    "model  fd is our fiducial model ; an energy of @xmath69  erg is instantaneously released at @xmath10 at @xmath70 ( see equation  ( [ eq : rs ] ) ) . for the initial distribution of the halo gas , we assume that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73  kpc to be consistent with gamma - ray observations ( section  [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "the index @xmath71 is an approximation of the profile obtained by @xcite .",
    "we solve equations  ( [ eq : diff ] ) and  ( [ eq : psi ] ) for @xmath74  yr .",
    "it is to be noted that if the smbh at the gc injects energy at a rate of 16% of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath75 ) for @xmath76  yr , the total energy is comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "the energy that goes into crs is @xmath77 in total .",
    "the spectral index of the accelerated crs is assumed to be @xmath78 .",
    "for the parameters we adopted , the maximum momentum at @xmath39 is @xmath79  ev . at @xmath39 , we assume that the diffusion coefficient has typical galactic values : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the energy of a cr proton @xcite . from equation  ( [ eq : kappa ] )",
    ", we obtain the initial wave energy density @xmath82 .",
    "if the temperature of the halo gas is @xmath83  k @xcite , the mach number of the shock at @xmath84  yr is @xmath85 . since it is generally believed that cr acceleration is ineffective at smaller mach numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume that cr acceleration finishes at @xmath86  yr .",
    "the current age of the bubble is assumed to be @xmath87  yr and the bubble center ( gc ) is located at a distance of 8.5  kpc .",
    "the current bubble size is @xmath88  kpc .",
    "other models are studied for comparison .",
    "their parameters are the same as those for model  fd except for the followings . in model",
    "ng , the wave growth is ignored , and we assume that @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "in model  la , acceleration of crs starts later , and we adopt @xmath91  yr and @xmath92  yr . in model  ci , energy is continuously injected from the gc at a rate of @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( see equation  ( [ eq : rsw ] ) ) , and we set @xmath95  yr so that the position of the peak of the surface brightness profiles is almost the same as that of model  fd .",
    "figure  [ fig : pro ] shows the surface brightness profiles of the bubble .",
    "they are calculated simply by projecting gamma - ray emissions on a plane at a distance of 8.5  kpc and we do not consider the detailed geometrical effects that come up when the distance to the fermi bubbles is finite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pro]a shows the results for model  fd , which are compared with the southern bubble data in figure  9 in @xcite ; one degree corresponds to @xmath96  kpc .",
    "since our model is rather simple and we do not include background , we shift the observational data along the horizontal axis ( @xmath97 ) and the vertical axis ( @xmath98 in the 15 gev band and @xmath99 in the 520 band ) . at 2 and 10  gev ,",
    "the predicted profiles are fairly flat and have sharp edges at @xmath100 as observations suggest ( figure  [ fig : pro]a ) .",
    "significant gamma - ray emissions fill the bubble , because not all the gas is concentrated at the shock .",
    "( model  fd in figure  [ fig : sedov ] ) .",
    "the sharp edges seen in figure  [ fig : pro]a are created by the dense gas just behind the shock . moreover",
    ", the wave amplification outside the shock also contributes to the formation of the sharp edges .",
    "figure  [ fig : amp ] shows the wave amplification @xmath101 at @xmath102 and @xmath103 for model  fd .",
    "the amplification leads to the decrease of the diffusion coefficient ( equation  ( [ eq : kappa ] ) ) and slows the cr diffusion out of the bubble .",
    "while the wave energy @xmath104 grows at a given radius outside the shock ( equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) ) , the wave energy at the expanding shock ( @xmath105 ) gradually decreases .",
    "while @xmath101 is not much dependent on cr momentum at @xmath106  ev ( figure  [ fig : amp ] ) , @xmath107 is a decreasing function of cr momentum ( equations  ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa_i ] ) ) .",
    "this means that @xmath108 is an increasing function of cr momentum and crs with larger energies diffuse faster . assuming that cr acceleration stopped at @xmath109 , crs are left far behind the shock at @xmath103 if their diffusion is not much effective .",
    "this happens for gev crs in model  fd ; most of them remain far behind the shock . however , this is not the case for crs with much larger energies . at @xmath103 and @xmath102 ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient for crs with @xmath110  tev is @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the diffusion scale - length is @xmath112  kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the shock velocity at @xmath103 is @xmath113 , and thus the advection scale - length is @xmath114  kpc . since @xmath115 ,",
    "most crs do not diffuse beyond the shock radius , although the diffusion can not be ignored .",
    "this explains the profile of 1  tev gamma - rays , which is created by crs with @xmath1  tev ( figure  [ fig : pro]a ) .",
    "the moderate diffusion enables some of the tev crs to reach the very high density region just behind the shock .",
    "this makes the surface brightness at 1  tev a little brighter than those at smaller energies ( figure  [ fig : pro]a ) .",
    "we note that the slight increase of @xmath101 at @xmath116  ev in figure  [ fig : amp ] is caused by the higher - energy crs that have arrived at @xmath117 . in model",
    "ng , in which the wave growth is ignored , the diffusion for gev crs is the moderate one and the surface brightness in the gev band is larger than that for model  fd ( figure  [ fig : pro]b ) .",
    "however , the diffusion of crs with @xmath118  tev is much faster and the crs diffuse beyond the shock radius ( figure  [ fig : pro]b ) .",
    "while the surface brightness profile for a given energy is relatively flat for model  ng , the spatial extension of crs varies with their energies because of the fairly large and energy - dependent diffusion ( equation  ( [ eq : kappa_i ] ) ) .",
    "in model  la , the limb - brightening becomes more prominent because crs do not have much time to diffuse out ( figure  [ fig : pro]b ) .",
    "thus , @xmath119 must be much smaller than @xmath120 , or cr acceleration must have started at the shock when the bubble is small .",
    "the observed flatness of the surface brightness profiles may also imply that the time - scale of the energy injection at the gc is much shorter than the age of the bubble ( @xmath121 ) . in models",
    "fd , ng and la , we implicitly assumed that @xmath122 . on the other hand , in model  ci",
    "the energy has been continuously injected at the gc ( @xmath123 ) . in this case , the halo gas inside the bubble ( @xmath19 ) is compressed into a thin dense shell between the shock and the contact discontinuity at @xmath124 ( figure  [ fig : sedov ] ) . if the region behind the contact discontinuity ( @xmath125 ) is almost empty with gas , the gamma - ray image should have a shell - like structure ( model  ci in figure  [ fig : pro]b ) , because gamma - rays are created through the interaction between crs and the gas of the thin shell . in model  ci",
    ", we assume that the gas density inside the contact discontinuity is @xmath126 for a calculational purpose .    figure  [ fig : sp ] shows the gamma - ray spectrum of the bubble for model  fd .",
    "the observed hard gamma - ray spectrum is reproduced , which reflects that the spectral index of the crs around the bubble is not much different from the original one ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is because of the decrease of the diffusion coefficient or the confinement of crs around the bubble . for model  ng",
    ", the confinement depends on cr energies , and the original cr spectrum is not conserved @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : sp ] , the gamma - ray luminosity in the tev band is slightly larger than that in the gev band as was shown in figure  [ fig : pro]a . we note that the tev luminosity depends on @xmath52 .",
    "for example , larger @xmath50 makes @xmath52 smaller ( equation  ( [ eq : pmax ] ) ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : sp ] shows the spectrum when @xmath127 ; other parameters are the same as those for model  fd .",
    "as can be seen , the tev luminosity is much reduced . in figure",
    "[ fig : sp ] , we also present the neutrino spectrum for model  fd .",
    "the flux is similar to the one predicted by @xcite , and thus their discussion can be applied .",
    "our results indicate that the neutrino flux is comparable to the background and it could be marginally detected @xcite .",
    "model  fd indicates that the position of the shock is a few kpc outside the edge of the gamma - ray bubble .",
    "x - ray emission from the high - density gas just behind the shock could have been detected there @xcite . in model",
    "fd , in which crs are accelerated to pev , we also predict that the size of the bubble is larger in the tev band ( figure  [ fig : pro]a ) , because of the faster diffusion of higher energy crs .",
    "the difference of the size of the bubble between the gev and tev bands could be used to discriminate our hadronic model from other leptonic models . in the leptonic models ,",
    "gamma - rays originate from electrons and the cooling time of the electrons with energies of @xmath128  gev is smaller than the age of the bubbles ( figure  28 in * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the electrons must be being accelerated .",
    "thus , the gamma - rays should be observed around the acceleration sites and the gamma - ray distribution should not depend on the energy band .",
    "in particular , since the cooling time of tev electrons is very short ( @xmath129  yr ) , the diffusion of the electrons can be ignored and the distribution of the gamma - rays from them should reflect the positions of the acceleration sites .",
    "we solve a diffusion - advection equation to investigate the evolution of the distribution of crs accelerated at the shock front of the fermi bubbles .",
    "we found that the observed flat surface brightness profile with a sharp edge can be reproduced because of the gas inside the bubbles and the reduced diffusion coefficient owing to cr streaming instabilities .",
    "the latter also contributes to the hard spectrum of the bubbles .",
    "the cr acceleration must have started at the early stage of the bubble evolution and the time - scale of energy injection at the gc must be much smaller than the current age of the bubbles .    the hadronic model by @xcite , the bubbles are long - lived ( @xmath130  gyr ) or steady .",
    "this is not likely in our model because the forward shocks rapidly cross the halo ( @xmath131  yr ) , unless the background gas is rapidly falling toward the galactic plane .",
    "if the smbh blows winds , reverse shocks may develop in the winds @xcite , and crs may be accelerated there .",
    "our model does not treat this type of acceleration .",
    "if the reverse shocks disappear in a short time , the situation may not be much different from the one we considered .",
    "moreover , since the reverse shocks are located in the innermost region of the bubbles , it may take a longer time for the crs accelerated there to diffuse out to the dense region at the bubble edge than those accelerated at the forward shocks .",
    "thus , the contribution of the former to the gamma - ray emission may be less than that of the latter .",
    "@xcite indicated that the activity of the smbh lasted @xmath132  yr and the current age of the bubbles is @xmath131  yr , which are consistent with our model .",
    "they also indicated that buoyancy may deform the bubbles .",
    "although it may somewhat change the height of the bubbles , our results may not be much affected as long as crs generally move with the background gas .",
