    "then , for any integers @xmath62 and @xmath63 , there is a compact 3-manifold @xmath31 admitting a distance @xmath64 heegaard splitting of genus @xmath4 , say @xmath35 , such that @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we omit the proof .    under the arguments in theorem 1 , we have the following result :    * theorem 2 .",

    ". then we will prove theorem 1 when @xmath69 in section 3 , theorem 1 when @xmath70 in section 5 , and theorem 2 in section 4 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a compact surface of genus at least 1 , and @xmath71 be the curve complex of @xmath9 .",

    "let @xmath90 be a compact surface of genus at least 1 with non - empty boundary .",
    "similar to the definition of the curve complex @xmath91 , we can define the arc and curve complex @xmath92 as follows :    each vertex of @xmath92 is the isotopy class of an essential simple closed curve or an essential properly embedded arc in @xmath90 , and a set of vertices form a simplex of @xmath92 if these vertices are represented by pairwise disjoint arcs or curves in @xmath90 . for any two disjoint vertices , we place an edge between them .",
    "all the vertices and edges form 1-skeleton of @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath93 . and for each edge , we assign it length 1 .",
