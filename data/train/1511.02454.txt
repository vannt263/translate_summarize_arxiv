    "is required to schedule the replenishment times of numerous commodities ( sometimes called items or products ) in order to supply an external demand per commodity .",
    "we refer to the schedule of the replenishment times as the ordering policy .",
    "each commodity incurs fixed ordering costs every time it is replenished as well as linear holding costs that are proportional to the quantity of the commodity held in storage . linking all commodities ,",
    "a joint ordering cost is incurred whenever one or more commodities are ordered .",
    "the objective of jrp is to minimize the sum of ordering and holding costs .",
    "it is a natural extension of the classical economic lot - sizing model that considers the optimal trade - off between ordering costs and holding costs for a single commodity . with multiple commodities",
    ", jrp adds the possibility of saving resources via coordinated replenishments , a common phenomenon in supply chain management .",
    "jrp is a special case of one - warehouse - n - retailers problem ( ownr ) , which deals with a single warehouse receiving goods from an external supplier and distributing to multiple retailers .",
    "the warehouse could also serve as a storage point .",
    "jrp in particular is a special case of the ownr with a very high warehouse holding cost .",
    "there are some distinctions between variations of jrp .",
    "* commodity order policy constraints : there are 3 types of order policy constraints for the jrp .",
    "the first model requires a periodic ordering policy .",
    "a periodic ordering policy is one in which for each commodity we must determine a cycle time .",
    "an order will occur at each  multiple of that cycle time .",
    "we refer to this model as the periodic jrp ( pjrp ) .",
    "the second model does not require a cycle time for each commodity ; however it requires a cyclic ordering policy .",
    "we refer to this model as the cyclic jrp ( cjrp ) .",
    "the last model has no limits on the ordering policy .",
    "note that pjrp is a constrained version of cjrp , which in turn is a constrained version of the ordering policy jrp . in this research",
    "we focus on pjrp .",
    "* joint order policy constraints : the joint ordering cost in the pjrp model is a complicated function of the inter - replenishment times , so it is often assumed that joint orders are placed periodically , even if some joint orders are empty , and that the cycle times of the commodities are always amultiple of the joint order cycle time .",
    "we denote this type of policy asthe general integer model ( gi ) , while policies with no joint order constraints are referred to as  the general integer model with correction factor ( gicf ) .",
    "the pjrp with gi policy constraint is also referred to as strict pjrp .",
    "we refer to pjrp with gicf policy constraint as the general pjrp or simply as pjrp .",
    "note that strict pjrp is a constrained version of general pjrp . in this research",
    "we focus on the general pjrp . * demand type : another important distinction is between problems with stationary demand for each commodity and problems with fluctuating demand .",
    "note that  the problem with stationary demand is a special case of the problem with fluctuating demand . in this research",
    "we focus on the set of problems with stationary demand .",
    "* time horizon : the time horizon defines the horizon for which one must plan an order policy .",
    "we distinguish between the problem with infinite horizon and the problem with finite horizon .",
    "most of the research over the years focused on jrp with an infinite horizon , specifically when considering stationary demand .",
    "the motivation for considering a finite horizon with non - stationary demand comes from knowing the demand only for a finite horizon .",
    "this motivation does not apply for stationary demand .",
    "* solution integrality : the integrality of the solution determines whether the ordering policy will be integral or not .",
    "note that the integral problem is a constrained version of the continuance problem . in this research",
    "we focus on the integral problem .      as far as we know , the complexity of jrp with stationary demands remained open for all models .",
    "some papers addressing jrp with constant demands ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) mistakenly cite a result by arkin et al .",
    "arj1989 , which proves that jrp with non - stationary demands is @xmath1-hard .",
    "arkin et al .",
    "@xcite stated that since jrp is a special case of ownr , proving jrp hardness also proves the hardness of ownr . lately",
    ", schulz and telha @xcite have proved that finding an optimal replenishment policy for the stationary pjrp is at least as hard as the integer factorization problem .",
    "when referring to the existence of a polynomial - time optimal algorithm for the stationary pjrp , schulz and telha also stated that this case remains open . in this paper",
    "we show that the pjrp with stationary demands is strongly @xmath2-hard .",
    "* strict pjrp . *",
    "the problem of strict pjrp was well covered in the reviews by goyal and satir @xcite and khouja and goyal @xcite .",
    "many research attempts have been made to find efficient solutions to strict pjrp . in the early 1970s ,",
    "two pioneer studies suggested  a graphical heuristic approach @xcite , @xcite . at the same time , goyal g1973 had suggested a non - polynomial lower bound based heuristics to find the optimal strict cyclic policy , in which the cycle time for each commodity is the joint replenishment cycle time .",
    "van eijs @xcite suggested a modified version of goyal s algorithm that involved using a non - strict cyclic policy .",
    "based on these studies , many heuristics have been developed to solve the strict pjrp .",
    "silver @xcite developed a heuristic algorithm to find the joint period cycle time . following this algorithm many iterative search heuristics",
    "were suggested with different search bounds ( kaspi and rosenblatt @xcite , goyal and belton @xcite , kaspi and rosenblatt kr1991 , goyal and deshmukh @xcite , viswanathan @xcite , fung and ma @xcite that was later modified by @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "wildeman et al .",
    "@xcite used the idea of the iterative search and implemented it in a heuristic that converges to an optimal solution . for certain values of the joint period cycle time they solved strict pjrp optimally using a lipschitz optimization procedure .",
    "another heuristic approach for the problem was developed by olsen @xcite , called evolutionary algorithm .    since jrp is a special case of ownr , results regarding the ownr hold for jrp as well .",
    "hence , the following results are applicable for jrp .",
    "a prominent advancement in the study of ownr , the optimal power - of - two policy , was achieved by roundy @xcite .",
    "this policy could be computed in @xmath3 time .",
    "roundy proved that the cost of the best power - of - two policy can achieve @xmath4 of an optimal policy ( @xmath5 if the base planning period is fixed ) .",
    "in other words , he suggested a 1.02-approximation ( 1.064 for the fixed based planning period ) for jrp , where a @xmath6-approximation algorithm is an algorithm that is polynomial with respect to the number of elements , and the ratio between the worst case scenario solution and the optimal solution is bounded by a constant , @xmath6 .",
    "note that fixed based planning period implies an integral model , while the general power - of - two policy allows a non - integral solution .",
    "based on roundy s findings , jackson et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an efficient algorithm that offers a replenishment policy in which the cost is within  a factor of @xmath7 of the optimal solution .",
    "this approximation was later improved to @xmath8 for a non - fixed based planning period @xcite .",
    "several studies have been made based on the power - of - two policy , including lee and yao @xcite , muckstadt and roundy @xcite , teo and bertsimas @xcite .",
    "teo and bertsimas have also noted in their paper that finding the optimal lot sizing policies for stationary demand lot sizing problems is still an open issue .",
    "lu and posner @xcite presented a fully polynomial time approximation scheme ( fptas ) for the strict pjrp model with fixed base .",
    "later , segev s20012 presented a quasi - polynomial - time approximation scheme ( qptas ) , which shows that the problem is most likely not @xmath9-hard .",
    "in addition , efficient polynomial time approximation scheme ( eptas ) for jrp with finite time horizon and stationary demand was presented by nonner and sviridenco @xcite .",
    "this problem was researched in many other different setups , such as jrp under resource constraints ( goyal @xcite , khouja et al @xcite and moon and cha @xcite ) , minimum order quantities ( porras and dekker @xcite ) and non - stationary holding cost ( levi et al .",
    "@xcite , nonner and souza @xcite , levi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "* general pjrp .",
    "* porras and dekker @xcite pointed out that adding the correction factor leads to a completely different problem , at least in terms of exact solvability .",
    "porras and dekker @xcite show that changing the model from strict pjrp to pjrp significantly changes the joint replenishment cycles and the commodities replenishment cycles .",
    "the difference in solvability is evidenced by the sheer number of decision variables . in the strict pjrp",
    "all commodities cycle times are simple functions of the joint replenishment cycle time .",
    "thus there is actually only a single decision variable .",
    "however , this is not the case with the pjrp where we have @xmath10 decision variables , one for each commodity .",
    "we believe this to be the main reason for the difference in the amount of research conducted on strict pjrp with respect to the pjrp despite the pjrp  being more practical . in practice ,",
    "strict pjrp is much less common than pjrp as it involves paying for empty deliveries .",
    "strict pjrp may occur only if there is a binding contract with a delivery company .",
    "although such a binding contract may decrease the cost of the joint replenishment significantly , it usually limits the flexibility of choosing the joint replenishment cycles .",
    "lately , schulz and telha @xcite presented a polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for the pjrp case .",
    "* finite horizon . *",
    "several heuristics were designed to deal with the finite horizon model .",

    "as the time horizon @xmath13 increases , the ratio converges to @xmath12 .",
    "schulz and telha @xcite also presented an fptas for the strict pjrp case with no fixed base and a finite time horizon .",
    "our paper proceeds as follows : in section [ model formulation ] we formulate the problem . in section [ section - infinite ] we prove that the infinite horizon pjrp is strongly @xmath0-hard . in section section - finite we show why the finite horizon pjrp is @xmath0-hard ( not necessarily in the strong sense ) .",

    "the demand has to be satisfied in each period .",
    "backlogging and lost sales are not allowed .",
    "each commodity incurs a fixed ordering cost for each period in which an order of the commodity is placed , as well as a linear inventory holding cost for each period a unit of commodity remains in storage .",
