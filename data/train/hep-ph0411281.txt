    "if one neglects the tiny masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , which are much smaller than @xmath8 , then the qcd lagrangian exhibits the    @xmath9    symmetry .",
    "this is because the quark - gluon interaction lagrangian in the chiral limit does not mix the left- and right - handed components of quarks and hence the total qcd lagrangian for the two - flavor qcd can be split into the left - handed and right - handed parts which do not communicate with each other .",
    "we know that the @xmath1 symmetry of the classical qcd lagrangian is absent at the quantum level because of the @xmath1 anomaly , which is an effect of quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we also know that the chiral @xmath10 symmetry is spontaneously ( dynamically ) broken in the qcd vacuum @xcite . that this is so is directly evidenced by the nonzero value of the quark condensate , @xmath11 , which represents an order parameter for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this quark condensate shows that in the qcd vacuum the left - handed quarks are correlated with the right - handed antiquarks ( and vice verca ) and hence the qcd vacuum breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "this spontaneous ( dynamical ) breaking of chiral symmetry is a pure quantum effect based upon quantum fluctuations . to see the latter we remind the reader that the chiral symmetry breaking can be formulated via the schwinger - dyson ( gap ) equation .",
    "it is not yet clear at all which specific gluonic interactions are the most important ones as a kernel of the schwinger - dyson equation ( e.g. instantons @xcite symmetry breakings by instantons is a quark field quantum fluctuations process .",
    "this is because the t hooft effective interaction is obtained only upon integrating of the @xmath1 anomaly . ] , or gluonic exchanges @xcite , or perhaps other gluonic interactions , or a combination of different interactions ) .",
    "but in any case the quantum fluctuations of the quark and gluon fields are very strong in the low - lying hadrons and induce both chiral and @xmath1 breakings . as a consequence we do not observe any chiral or @xmath1 multiplets low in the hadron spectrum .    that the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is an effect of quantum fluctuations of the quark field",
    "can be seen most generally from the definition of the quark condensate , which is a closed quark loop :    @xmath12    this closed quark loop explicitly contains a factor @xmath13 .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking , which is necessaraly a nonperturbative effect , is actually a ( nonlocal ) coupling of a quark line with the closed quark loop , which is a tadpole graph .",
    "hence it always contains an extra factor @xmath13 as compared to the tree - level quark line .",
    "the upper part of both baryon @xcite and meson @xcite spectra almost systematically exhibits multiplets of the chiral and @xmath1 groups ( for a pedagogical overview see @xcite ) , though a careful experimental exploration of high - lying spectra must be done for a final conclusion .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as effective chiral symmetry restoration or chiral symmetry restoration of the second kind .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 and fig .",
    "2 , where the excitation spectrum of the nucleon from the pdg compilation @xcite as well as the excitation spectrum of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( with the @xmath16 content ) mesons @xcite are shown . states , and hence irrelevant for the present analysis , have been removed from the consideration . these are well established @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are believed to be mostly glueball and @xmath19 states , respectively , as well as @xmath20 which is seen in @xmath21 and considered by the authors of the partial wave analysis as a glueball due to its decay modes @xcite . ]",
    "starting from the 1.7 gev region the nucleon spectrum shows obvious signs of parity doubling .",
    "there are couple of examples where chiral partners of highly excited states have not yet been seen",
    ". their experimental discovery would be an important task .",
    "all possible irreducible representations of the parity - chiral group necessarily contain parity doublets @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the chirally restored regime @xmath14 and @xmath22 @xmath15 states must be systematically degenerate .    a quantitative measure of chiral symmetry breaking contribution to the hadron mass at the leading ( linear ) order is the _ chiral asymmetry _",
    "@xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are masses of particles within the same multiplet .",
    "this parameter has the interpretation of the part of the hadron mass due to chiral symmetry breaking . from the low - lying states the chiral asymmetry is typically 0.2 - 0.6 ,",
    "as can be seen e.g. from comparison of masses of the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath14 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , or @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the chiral asymmetry is large as above , then it makes no sense to assign a given hadron to the chiral multiplet since its wave function is a strong mixture of different representations and we have to expect also large _ nonlinear _ symmetry breaking effects .",
    "indeed , there is even no one - to - one mapping of the positive and negative parity hadrons low in the spectrum .",
    "it indicates that here the chiral symmetry breaking effects are very strong and as a consequence the chiral symmetry is realized nonlinearly .",
    ".chiral multiplets of @xmath14 and @xmath32 mesons @xcite .",
    "comments : ( i ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 are well established states and can be found in the meson summary table of review of particle physics @xcite .",
    "( ii ) @xmath35 is abbreviated as @xmath36 in the meson summary table of review of particle physics @xcite ; @xmath37 is seen in @xmath21 as @xmath22 state @xcite and also recently as @xmath38 peak in the @xmath39 channel in @xmath40 decays at @xmath41 mev @xcite ; the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite confirms a @xmath22 nature of this state .",
    "( iii ) these states are clearly seen in a few different channels in @xmath21 @xcite , though in order to appear in the meson summary table of review of particle physics they must be reconfirmed by independent experiment . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in all these cases the hadrons can be believed to be members of chiral multiplets with a tiny admixture of other representations .",
    "it also means that practically the whole mass of the hadron _ is not related _ to the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum .",
    "by definition effective symmetry restoration means the following . in qcd hadrons with quantum numbers",
    "@xmath42 are created when one applies the local interpolating field ( current ) @xmath43 with such quantum numbers on the vacuum @xmath44 .",
    "then all hadrons that are created by the given interpolator appear as intermediate states in the two - point correlator    @xmath45    where all possible lorentz and dirac indices ( specific for a given interpolating field ) have been omitted .",
    "consider two local interpolating fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 which are connected by a chiral transformation ,    @xmath48    where    @xmath49    ( or by the @xmath1 transformation )",
    ". then if the vacuum was invariant under the chiral group ,    @xmath50    it would follow from ( [ corr ] ) that the spectra created by the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 would be identical .",
    "we know that in qcd one finds    @xmath51    as a consequence the spectra of the two operators must be in general different and we do not observe any chiral or @xmath1 multiplets in the low - lying hadron spectra .",
    "however , it happens that the noninvariance of the vacuum becomes unimportant ( irrelevant ) high in the spectrum .",
    "then the masses of the corresponding opposite parity hadrons , which are the members of the given parity - chiral multiplet , become close at large @xmath52 ( and identical asymptotically high ) ,    @xmath53    we stress that this effective chiral symmetry restoration does not mean that chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum disappears , but that the role of the quark condensates that break chiral symmetry in the vacuum becomes progressively less important high in the spectrum .",
    "one could say that the valence quarks in high - lying hadrons _ decouple _ from the qcd vacuum .",
    "in ref . @xcite a justification for this chiral symmetry restoration has been suggested .",
    "namely , at large space - like momenta @xmath54 the correlator can be adequately represented by the operator product expansion , where all nonperturbative effects reside in different condensates @xcite .",
    "the only effect that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can have on the correlator is via the quark condensate of the vacuum , @xmath55 , and higher dimensional condensates that are not invariant under chiral transformation @xmath56 . however , the contributions of all these condensates are suppressed by the inverse powers of momenta @xmath57 .",
    "this shows that at large space - like momenta the correlation function becomes chirally symmetric .",
    "the dispersion relation provides a connection between the space - like and time - like domains of the correlator .",
    "in particular , the large @xmath57 correlator is completely dominated by the large @xmath52 spectral density @xmath58 , which is an observable",
    ". hence the large @xmath52 spectral density should be insensitive to the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum and the spectra of two operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 should approach each other ,    @xmath59    this is in contrast to the low @xmath52 spectra which are very different because of the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum .",
    "unfortunately ope at large @xmath57 does not allow us to make quantitative statements concerning the functional behaviour that determines approaching the chiral - invariant regime at large @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the ope is only an asymptotic expansion and hence can not be continued to the time - like region .    while the argument above on the asymptotic symmetry properties of spectral functions is rather robust ( it is based actually only on the asymptotic freedom of qcd at large space - like momenta and on the analyticity of the two - point correlator ) ,",
    "_ a - priori _ it is not clear whether it can be applied to the bound state systems , which the hadrons are .",
    "indeed , it can happen that the asymptotic symmetry restoration applies only to that part of the spectrum , which is above the resonance region ( i.e. where the current creates jets but not isolated hadrons ) .",
    "so the question arises whether it is possible to prove ( or at least justify ) the symmetry restoration in highly excited _ isolated _ hadrons .",
    "we show below that both chiral and @xmath1 restorations in highly excited isolated hadrons can be anticipated as a direct consequence of the semiclassical regime in the highly excited hadrons , indeed .    at large @xmath0 ( radial quantum number ) or at large angular momentum",
    "@xmath60 we know that in quantum systems the _ semiclassical _ approximation ( wkb ) _ must _ work .",
    "physically this approximation applies in these cases because the de broglie wavelength of particles in the system is small in comparison with the scale that characterizes the given problem .",
    "in such a system as a hadron the scale is given by the hadron size while the wavelength of valence quarks is given by their momenta .",
    "once we go high in the spectrum the size of hadrons increases as well as the typical momentum of valence quarks . this is why a highly excited hadron can be described semiclassically in terms of the underlying quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the physical content of the semiclassical approximation is most transparently given by the path integral .",
    "the contribution of the given path to the path integral is regulated by the action @xmath61 along the path @xmath62 ( the fields @xmath63 are collectively denoted as @xmath64 ) through the factor    @xmath65    the semiclassical approximation applies when the action in the system @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the whole amplitude ( path integral ) is dominated by the classical path @xmath67 ( stationary point ) and those paths that are infinitesimally close to the classical path .",
    "all other paths that differ from the classical one by an appreciable amount do not contribute .",
    "these latter paths would represent the quantum fluctuation effects .",
    "in other words , in the semiclassical case the quantum fluctuations effects are strongly suppressed and vanish asymptotically .",
    "mathematically it follows from the well known statement that when @xmath68 the functional integral can be calculated in the stationary phase approximation ( in euclidean space it is a steepest descent or saddle point approximation ) .",
    "the stationary point is a solution of the classical equations of motion in the presence of the source @xmath69 ,    @xmath70 = - j(x ) .",
    "\\label{cl}\\ ] ]    then the generating functional can be expanded in powers of @xmath13 as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 represents contributions of the lowest order quantum fluctuations around the classical solution ( determinant of the classical solution ) .",
    ") should not be mixed with the quenched qcd . while there are no vacuum fermion loops in quenched qcd like those in fig .",
    "3c , there are still quantum fluctuations of the valence quark lines which induce chiral symmetry breaking , see fig.3b .",
    "the first term in the expansion ( [ f ] ) does not contain any quantum fluctuations of the quark fields . ]",
    "the classical path , which is generated by @xmath74 , is a tree - level contribution to the path integral , see diagram a ) on fig . 3 , and keeps chiral symmetries of the classical lagrangian .",
    "its contribution is of the order @xmath75 .",
    "the quantum fluctuations contribute at the orders @xmath76 ( the one loop order , generated by @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 ( the two loops order ) , etc , see graphs b ) and c ) on fig .",
    "the @xmath1 as well as the spontaneous @xmath79 breakings result from quantum fluctuations of the quark fields and start from the one - loop order .",
    "however , in a hadron with large enough @xmath0 or @xmath60 , where action is large , the quantum fluctuations contributions must be relatively suppressed and vanish asymptotically .",
    "then it follows that in such systems both the chiral and @xmath1 symmetries must be restored .",
    "this is precisely what we see phenomenologically . in the nucleon spectrum",
    "the doubling appears either at large @xmath0 excitations of baryons with a given small spin or in resonances of large spin .",
    "similar features persist in the delta spectrum . in the meson spectrum",
    "the doubling is obvious for large @xmath0 excitations of small spin mesons @xcite and there are signs of doubling of large spin mesons ( the data are , however , sparse )",
    ". it would be certainly interesting and important to observe systematically multiplets of parity - chiral and parity-@xmath1 groups ( or , sometimes , when the chiral and @xmath1 transformations connect _ different _ hadrons , the multiplets of the @xmath2 group @xcite ) .",
    "the high - lying hadron spectra must be systematically explored .",
    "while the argument above is solid , theoretically it is not clear _ a - priori _ whether isolated hadrons still exist at excitation energies where a semiclassical regime is achieved .",
    "hence it is conceptually important to demonstrate that in qcd hadrons still exist , while the dynamics inside such hadrons already is semiclassical .",
    "we do not know how to prove it for @xmath80 .",
    "however , the large @xmath3 limit of qcd @xcite , while keeping all basic properties of qcd like asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry , allows for a significant simplification . it is a good approximation , e.g. , for the low - lying baryons @xcite .    in this limit",
    "it is known that all mesons represent narrow states , i.e. they are stable against strong decays . at the same time the spectrum of mesons",
    "is infinite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is necessary to match the two - point function in the perturbation theory regime ( which contains logarithm ) at large space - like momenta with the discrete spectral sum in the dispersion integral .",
    "then one can always excite a meson of any arbitrary large energy , which is of any arbitrary large size .",
    "in such a meson the action @xmath66 .",
    "hence a description of this meson necessarily must be semiclassical . then the equation of motion in such a meson",
    "must be according to some yet unknown solution of the classical qcd lagrangian for a colorless meson .",
    "hence it must exhibit chiral and @xmath1 symmetries .",
    "this proves that it is possible to have an isolated hadron which can be described semiclassically .",
    "actually we do not need the exact @xmath81 limit for this statement .",
    "it can be formulated in the following way . for any large @xmath66",
    "there always exist such @xmath3 that the isolated meson with such an action does exist and can be described semiclassically . from the empirical fact that we observe multiplets of chiral and @xmath1 groups high in the hadron spectrum",
    "it follows that @xmath5 is large enough for this purpose .",
    "the strength of the argument given above is that it is very general .",
    "however we can not say anything concrete about how all this happens . for that one needs a detailed microscopical understanding of both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , and in particular a classical solution of the qcd lagrangian for a highly - excited color - singlet hadron , around which an expansion ( 13 ) can be performed , which is a challenging task .",
    "but even though we can only assume how microscopically all this happens , it is a solid statement that in highly excited hadrons symmetries of the classical qcd lagrangian should be observed .",
    "the only basis for this statement is that in such hadrons a semiclassical description is correct . or @xmath60 is well known e.g. from the lamb shift .",
    "the lamb shift is a result of the radiative corrections ( which represent effects of quantum fluctuations of electron and electromagnetic fields ) and vanishes as @xmath82 , and also very fast with increasing @xmath60 . as a consequence high in the hydrogen spectrum the symmetry of the classical coulomb potential",
    "gets restored .",
    "the author is grateful to d.o .",
    "riska for suggesting this nice analogy .",
    "the other well - known example is the t hooft model @xcite ( qcd in 1 + 1 dimensions ) . in this model in the regime @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , the spectrum of the high - lying states is known exactly , @xmath86 . the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian is broken ( with no contradiction with the coleman theorem since in this specific regime everything is determined by @xmath81 , for any large but finite @xmath3 the chiral symmetry is not broken in agreement with the coleman theorem ) , which is due to gluon dressing of valence quarks and which is reflected by the fact that the positive and negative parity states are not degenerate and alternate in the spectrum .",
    "however , the mass difference between the neighbouring positive and negative parity states is @xmath87 and vanishes high in the spectrum since the effect of quantum fluctuations dies out high in the spectrum .",
    "the latter can be explicitly seen from the fact that the amplitude of the higher quark fock component in the meson wave function dies out very fast with increasing n @xcite .",
    "the author is grateful to t. cohen , t. degrand , s. peris and a. zhitnitsky for discussions on this point . ]",
    "using very general arguments we have shown that both @xmath79 and @xmath1 symmetries of the classical qcd lagrangian should be approximately restored in highly excited hadrons and manifest asymptotically high .",
    "the reason is that in highly excited hadrons physics must necessarily be semiclassical .",
    "unfortunately solutions of the classical qcd equations of motion for the white hadrons are yet unknown .",
    "hence we can make only an assumption about the corresponding physical picture .",
    "if one constructs a highly excited hadron as a string ( flux tube ) with quarks at the ends that have definite chirality @xcite , which is a semiclassical picture , then one necessarily obtains all hadrons in chiral and @xmath1 multiplets .",
    "such a picture is rather natural and is well compatible with the nambu string picture @xcite .",
    "the ends of the string in the nambu model move with velocity of light .",
    "then , ( it is an extention of the nambu model ) the quarks at the ends of the string must have definite chirality . in this way one is able to explain at the same time both regge trajectories , chiral multiplet structure of excited hadrons and absense of the spin - orbit force in the @xmath88 sector .",
