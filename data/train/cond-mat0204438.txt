    "the motion of surfaces and interfaces plays a central role in many scientific and technological disciplines . in particular , the dynamics of interfaces such as phase- and grain boundaries in solid materials @xcite and domain walls in magnets @xcite and ferroelectrics heavily influence both dynamic and static materials properties . among interfaces characteristic of two - dimensional systems",
    "are steps on crystal surfaces @xcite , domain walls in thin magnetic and dielectric films @xcite , and boundaries between different types of vegetation such as savanna and rainforest @xcite .",
    "an enormous amount of work in recent years has been devoted to the dynamics and structure of moving and growing interfaces @xcite . however , despite the fact that many important interface properties , such as mobility and catalytic and chemical activity , are largely determined by the _ microscopic _ interface structure , most of this effort has been concentrated on large - scale scaling properties . although the detailed atomistic mechanisms by which interfaces move are often not known , useful understanding can be obtained from stochastic models in which the motion occurs through random nucleation and migration of local topological features such as kinks and steps @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to gain better insight into how , for different stochastic dynamics , the driving force ( such as an applied magnetic or electric field , a chemical - potential gradient , or the amount of rainfall in the case of models of vegetation distribution ) may alter the microscopic structure of the interface , thereby leading to a highly nonlinear velocity response .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we introduced a dynamic mean - field approximation for the microstructure of an interface in a two - dimensional kinetic ising ferromagnet with a single - spin - flip glauber dynamic @xcite , driven by an applied field @xcite .",
    "this model is directly applicable to many magnetic and ferroelectric systems and other cases where the interface dynamics are not inhibited by coupling to a conserved field @xcite .",
    "based on the resulting local interface structure , we obtained a nonlinear - response approximation for the steady - state propagation velocity , which was shown to be in good agreement with dynamic monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for a wide range of fields and temperatures .",
    "however , since the approximation was based on the burton - cabrera - frank ( bcf ) unrestricted solid - on - solid ( sos ) model @xcite , the overhangs and bubbles in the ising interface were handled in an uncontrolled way .",
    "here we therefore consider the performance of our approximation for the unrestricted sos model , so that overhangs and bubbles are absent at all times by definition of the model .",
    "in particular , we obtain the surface velocity under the glauber dynamic as a function of applied field and temperature , as well as its anisotropy for tilt angles between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in a recent paper @xcite we showed that the microscopic interface structure , and thus the mobility , can depend dramatically on the details of the dynamics .",
    "the most significant difference is between dynamics in which the transition probabilities of the local spins factorize into one part that depends only on the change in interaction energy due to the transition and one that depends only on the change in the field energy ( soft dynamics @xcite ) , and dynamics that can not be factorized in this way ( hard dynamics @xcite ) . for soft dynamics",
    ", the interface structure for all values of the field remains the _ same _ as in equilibrium at zero field @xcite , so that the mobility can be calculated exactly at the level of linear response . in the present paper we concentrate on the standard glauber dynamic @xcite , which belongs to the class of hard dynamics and",
    "thus leads to more complicated and interesting behavior .",
    "both the driven ising and sos surfaces belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) dynamic universality class @xcite , in which the macroscopic , stationary distribution for flat , moving interfaces is gaussian , corresponding to a random walk with independent increments .",
    "nevertheless , the step heights in several discrete models in this class are correlated at _ short _ distances @xcite . in the mean - field approximation developed here ,",
    "these short - range correlations are ignored .",
    "the resulting discrepancies , which are minor , are elucidated by comparison with mc simulations .",

    "( however , no skewness is observed for the soft glauber dynamic , a result which may be general for soft dynamics . ) the correlations associated with the skewness generally lead to a broadening of protrusions on the leading edge ( `` hilltops '' ) , while those on the trailing edge ( `` valley bottoms '' ) are sharpened @xcite , or the other way around @xcite . in terms of spin - class populations ,",
    "the former corresponds to @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the relative skewness can therefore be quantified by the two functions , @xmath133 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath134 these two skewness parameters are shown together in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew ] .",
    "the relative skewness is seen to be considerably stronger at the lower temperature .",
    "this temperature dependence is especially pronounced for @xmath135 .    yet another way to visualize",
    "the skewness is to consider the joint two - step pdf , @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "logarithmic contour plots of this quantity for different values of @xmath12 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] for @xmath53 at @xmath103 .",
    "it is clearly seen how the contours change with @xmath12 . for @xmath12=0",
    "a symmetric diamond shape with equidistant contours indicates statistical independence with single - step pdfs given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : step_pdf ] ) . for stronger fields",
    "we find shapes that are elongated in the second quadrant [ @xmath137 , @xmath138 and foreshortened in the fourth quadrant [ @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "this shape indicates that large negative @xmath3 tend to be followed by large positive @xmath141 ( sharp valleys ) , while positive @xmath3 tend to be followed by smaller negative @xmath141 ( rounded hilltops ) .",
    "we have not been successful in attempts to construct an analytical approximation which describes this evolution of the joint two - step pdf with increasing field .",
    "in this paper we have considered in detail the microstructure of an unrestricted solid - on - solid ( sos ) interface with glauber dynamics , which is driven far from equilibrium by an applied field .",
    "the microstructure is of interest because it determines a number of interface properties , such as mobility and chemical reactivity .",
    "we adapted to this model a mean - field , nonlinear - response approximation previously developed for driven ising interfaces without the sos restriction @xcite . in comparison to the ising driven interface , which leaves bubbles of the unstable phase in its wake and exhibits `` overhangs , '' the sos interface is a relatively simple object .",
    "the absence of overhangs and of fluctuations in the stable and unstable phases ( bubbles behind and in front of the interface ) makes the sos interface more suitable for description in terms of a mean - field type model .",
    "moreover , unlike the ising model , in which there are several effects that simultaneously contribute to the inaccuracy of the approximate treatment , the simpler sos structure makes it possible to identify the short - range correlations as the only significant factor causing deviations between the true interface behavior and the mean - field theory .    to study the microstructure of the interface in detail , we investigated the interface velocity as a function of driving field , temperature , and angle relative to the lattice axes .",
    "we also studied the local shape of the interface in terms of the spin - class populations and the probability density for individual steps in the interface . in essentially all cases we found excellent agreement between our theoretical description of the stationary moving interface and the results of our dynamic mc simulations .",
    "the microstructure of the moving interface depends crucially on the details of the stochastic dynamics , and for the glauber dynamic used here , the average height of a step in the interface was found to increase strongly with the applied field .",
    "our theory predicts that this should be the case ( with quantitative variations depending on the particular dynamic ) for any dynamic in which the single - spin transition rates can not be factorized into a part that depends only on interaction energies and another that depends only on the applied field ( hard dynamics @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for factorizing ( soft ) dynamics the interface structure should remain independent of the field .",
    "this was recently confirmed for the unrestricted sos interface by mc simulations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to use great caution in drawing conclusions about the microstructure of driven interfaces , based on dynamic mc simulations . for such conclusions to be valid ,",
    "the dynamic must be chosen appropriately to the physical system of interest .",
    "the hard type of dynamics would appear to be particularly suited for certain interfaces in magnetic or dielectric systems , where the local order parameter is not conserved .",
    "one aspect of the interface dynamics not completely captured by our model is , of course , the short - range correlations .",
    "namely , within the mean - field approximation used here , individual steps of the interface are assumed to be statistically independent .",
    "however , for increasing fields the interface undergoes a gradual breakdown of up / down symmetry .",
    "this is clearly seen in our simulations here , as well as in other examples of driven interfaces @xcite .",
    "it would seem likely that one could construct a mean - field approximation at the two - spin level , which might be able to predict this skewness for hard dynamics , as well as its absence for soft dynamics .",
