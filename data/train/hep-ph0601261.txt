    "a polarized antiproton beam of energy @xmath1  gev may be available in future experiments at the gsi - fair project",
    ". measurements of dilepton production in transversely polarized @xmath0 collisions are the main motivation for the proposed gsi - pax  @xcite and gsi - assia  @xcite experiments .",
    "the measurements would be carried out using a transversely polarized fixed proton target , or a proton beam of moderate energy @xmath2 gev .",
    "measurements of the transverse double - spin asymmetry @xmath3 defined as the ratio of transversely polarized and unpolarized cross sections , may provide information of the transversely polarized parton distribution functions of the proton , dubbed `` transversity '' @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "transversity will be probed by measurements of @xmath5 in polarized @xmath6 collisions at the bnl - rhic collider  @xcite . however , since the @xmath4 for sea quarks are expected to be small , the asymmetry is estimated to be at most a few percent  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , since for the drell - yan process in @xmath0 collisions the scattering of two valence quark densities contributes , and since in addition the kinematical regime of the planned gsi experiments is such that rather large parton momentum fractions @xmath7 are relevant , a very large @xmath5 of order 40@xmath8 or more is expected  @xcite . therefore , unique information on transversity in the valence region may be obtained from the gsi measurements , and information from rhic and the gsi would be complementary .",
    "here we give a brief report on a recent study of perturbative - qcd corrections to the cross sections and to @xmath5 for drell - yan dilepton production at gsi - fair  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the available fixed order corrections as well as all - order soft - gluon `` threshold '' resummation .",
    "by virtue of the factorization theorem , the cross section for the drell - yan process at large lepton pair invariant mass @xmath9 can be written in terms of a convolution of parton distribution functions and partonic scattering cross sections : @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 the hadronic c.m .",
    "energy , and where @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of one of the leptons .",
    "@xmath14 is the factorization scale . as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) , there are corrections suppressed with some power @xmath15 and some hadronic scale @xmath16",
    ". these corrections will become important for small @xmath9 and in particular for lower - energy collisions .",
    "the partonic cross section is calculated in qcd perturbation theory as a series in @xmath17 ; @xmath18\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for the unpolarized cross section the calculation has been performed up to @xmath22  @xcite , for the transversely polarized case to @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the lowest order gives @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the higher - order functions may be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "threshold resummation addresses large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the partonic cross section that arise when the initial partons have just enough energy to produce the lepton pair .",
    "only emission of relatively soft gluons is allowed in this case .",
    "the large corrections exponentiate when mellin moments of the partonic cross section , defined as @xmath26 are taken .",
    "to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy one then has for the resummed cross section  @xcite : @xmath27}\\\\ & & \\hspace{50pt}\\times\\exp\\left\\ { 2 \\int_0 ^ 1 dz\\ ,                { \\frac{z^{n-1}-1}{1-z}}\\right.\\nn\\\\    & & \\hspace{50pt}\\times\\left.\\int_{\\mu^2}^{(1-z)^2 m^2 } { \\frac{dk_t^2}{k_t^2 } }         a_q({\\alpha_s}(k_t))\\right\\ } \\ ; , \\nn \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 with @xmath29 and  @xcite : @xmath30\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the number of flavors and @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 collects mostly hard virtual corrections .",
    "it is given as @xmath34 we note that it was shown in  @xcite that these coefficient functions also exponentiate .",
    "( [ dyres ] ) is ill - defined because of the divergence in the perturbative running coupling @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the expression shows factorial divergence , which in qcd corresponds to a power - like ambiguity of the series .",
    "it turns out , however , that the factorial divergence appears only at nonleading powers of momentum transfer .",
    "the large logarithms we are resumming arise in the region  @xcite @xmath37 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ dyres ] ) .",
    "therefore to nll they are contained in the simpler expression @xmath38 for the second exponent in  ( [ dyres ] ) .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath39 .",
    "this form , to which we will return below , is used for `` minimal '' expansions  @xcite of the resummed exponent .",
    "for the nll expansion of the resummed exponent one finds from eqs .",
    "( [ dyres]),([dyres1 ] )  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 the explicit expressions for the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be found e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hadronic cross section is obtained by performing an inverse mellin transformation of the resummed partonic cross section , multiplied by the appropriate moments of two parton densities : @xmath44 in order to perform the inverse mellin integral , we need to specify a prescription for dealing with the singularity in the perturbative strong coupling constant in eq .",
    "( [ dyres ] ) .",
    "we will use the minimal prescription developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which relies on use of the nll expanded form involving the @xmath45 , and on choosing a contour to the left of the landau singularity at @xmath46 in the complex-@xmath47 plane .",
    "figure  [ kfac ] shows the effects of the higher orders generated by resummation for @xmath48  gev@xmath49 and @xmath50  gev@xmath49 .",
    "we define a resummed `` @xmath51-factor '' as the ratio of the resummed cross section to the leading order ( lo ) cross section , @xmath52 which is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath53 is very large , meaning that resummation results in a dramatic enhancement over lo , sometimes by over two orders of magnitude for the collisions at lower energy .",
    "it is then interesting to see how this enhancement builds up order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "we expand the resummed formula to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and beyond and define the `` soft - gluon @xmath51-factors '' @xmath54 which for @xmath55 give the effects due to the @xmath56 terms in the resummed formula . the results for @xmath57 are also shown in fig .",
    "one can see that there are very large contributions even beyond nnlo , in particular at the higher @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , the full resummation given by the solid line receives contributions from high orders .",
    "we stress that the @xmath58 and @xmath59 expansions of the resummed result are in excellent agreement with the full nlo and nnlo ones , respectively ( circle and square symbols in figure  [ kfac ] ) .",
    "this shows that the higher - order corrections are really dominated by the threshold logarithms and that the resummation is accurately collecting the latter .",
    "there is good reason to believe that the large enhancement from soft - gluon radiation seen above is only partly physical .",
    "the large corrections arise from a region where the integral in the exponent becomes sensitive to the behavior of the integrand at small values of @xmath60 . as long as @xmath61",
    ", the use of perturbation theory may be justified , but when @xmath62 becomes very large , @xmath60 will reach down to nonperturbative scales .",
    "we seek a modification of the perturbative expression in eq .",
    "( [ dyres ] ) that excludes the region in which the absolute value of @xmath60 is less than some nonperturbative scale @xmath63 . to implement this idea",
    ", we will adopt a modified resummed hard scattering , which reproduces nll logarithmic behavior in the moment variable @xmath47 so long as @xmath64 , but `` freezes '' once @xmath65 . if nothing else , this will test the importance of the region @xmath66 for the resummed cross section .",
    "if @xmath47 were real and positive , we could simply replace the resummed exponent in  ( [ dyres1 ] ) by @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and where @xmath63 then serves to cut off the lower logarithmic behavior . to provide an expression that can be analytically continued to complex @xmath47 , we choose @xmath69 , with integer @xmath15 .",
    "this simple form is consistent with the minimal expansion given above , and it also allows for a straightforward analysis of the ensuing branch cuts in the complex-@xmath47 plane . for definiteness , we choose @xmath70",
    ". we will continue to use the expansions in eq .",
    "( [ lndeltams ] ) , but redefine @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ lamdef ] ) by @xmath71 of course , different choices of @xmath63 give different results , but we should think of @xmath63 as a kind of factorization scale , separating perturbative contributions from nonperturbative",
    ". thus changes in @xmath63 would be compensated by changes in a nonperturbative function .",
    "our interest here , however , is simply to illustrate the modification of the perturbative sector , which we do by choosing @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 gev .",
    "results for the `` @xmath51-factor '' with these values of @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "[ farir ] , compared to the same nlo , nnlo and resummed cross sections as presented before .",
    "the ratios of the infrared - regulated resummed cross sections to lo show a smoother increase than the `` purely minimally '' resummed ones .",
    "the difference is particularly marked at the lower center of mass energy in fig .",
    "[ farir ] ( left ) , with only a modest enhancement over nnlo remaining .",
    "we interpret these results to indicate a strong sensitivity to nonperturbative dynamics at the lower energies , and much less at the higher .",
    "to perform numerical studies of the asymmetry @xmath5 we need to make a model for the transversity densities in the valence region . here , guidance is provided by the soffer inequality @xcite @xmath74 which gives an upper bound for each @xmath75 . following",
    "@xcite we utilize this inequality by saturating the bound at some low input scale @xmath76 using the nlo grv  @xcite and grsv ( `` standard scenario '' )  @xcite densities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . for @xmath79 the transversity densities @xmath80 are then obtained using the nlo evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ asym ] shows that @xmath5 is very robust under the qcd corrections , including resummation with and without a cutoff .",
    "this is expected to some extent because the emission of soft - gluons does not change the spin of the parent parton .",
    "thanks to the recent calculation of the three - loop splitting functions by moch , vermaseren and vogt  @xcite , we can now perform the threshold resummation for the drell - yan process to nnll accuracy .",
    "this leads to a new term in the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ lndeltams ] ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 includes the new @xmath83 and @xmath84 coefficients  @xcite , and where an additional @xmath85 term is included in the coefficient function , which may be extracted  @xcite from the known  @xcite nnlo results for the drell - yan process .",
    "the effects of nnll resummation on the unpolarized cross section are displayed in fig .",
    "one finds that the resummed cross section has a fast convergence , even at the lower energy .",
    "we have studied the perturbative qcd corrections to drell - yan dilepton production in transversely polarized @xmath0 collisions for the kinematical regime of proposed experiments at gsi - fair .",
    "we find that the @xmath51-factor for the available fixed - order corrections , and for the all - order nll soft - gluon resummation , can be very large .",
    "in contrast , the spin asymmetry is quite stable .",
    "we have highlighted the importance of rather small momentum scales in the resummed exponent at the lower energies .",
    "we have also examined the resummation to nnll and found it to give a rather modest correction .",
