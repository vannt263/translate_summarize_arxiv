    "cold atoms in optical lattices provide an excellent experimental tool to explore the interplay between interaction and disorder effects in many - body quantum systems @xcite . indeed , following the seminal paper by jaksch _",
    "et al_. @xcite ultracold atoms have been used to demonstrate a variety of fundamental theoretical concepts , such as the correlation - induced mott transition @xcite , and the existence of a mobility edge in non - interacting but disordered three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "currently , the problem of accessing the nel temperature , below which the interacting particles are in an antiferromagnetic state , is still unresolved .",
    "however , the recent observation of antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite , together with the theoretical proposal of a new cooling method @xcite , suggests that experiments with ultracold atoms are now approaching temperatures at which antiferromagnetic order appears .",
    "these developments motivated us to extend our previous work on correlated lattice fermions with spin - dependent disorder @xcite to the case with antiferromagnetic long - range order ( af - lro ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compute and discuss the magnetic ground state phase diagram of the anderson - hubbard model for spin @xmath0 fermions on a bipartite lattice at half - filling in the presence of spin - dependent disorder . here",
    "`` spin - dependent disorder '' means that disorder , i.e. randomly distributed local potentials , act only on fermions with one particular spin direction , while fermions with the opposite spin direction are unaffected by the disorder @xcite .",
    "our previous studies showed that spin - dependent disorder strongly destabilizes the metallic phase .",
    "this is due to the breaking of the spin symmetry and , thus , the blocking of spin - flip processes which are responsible for quasiparticle formation .",
    "moreover , a spin - selective localized phase was predicted @xcite . in this phase the particles with spin direction sensitive to randomness",
    "are localized , whereas particles in the opposite spin channel remain itinerant . the earlier studies of correlated lattice fermions with spin - dependent disorder @xcite focused on paramagnetic phases .",
    "thus the question remains whether , and to what extent , af - lro of the fermions will change these results .",
    "in particular , two questions arise : + 1 ) how does af - lro modify the paramagnetic ground state phase diagram of interacting fermions with spin - dependent disorder @xcite ? + 2 ) how does spin - dependent disorder affect the antiferromagnetic ground state phase diagram obtained for interacting fermions with conventional disorder , i.e. disorder acting equally on both spin directions @xcite ?",
    "+ the present investigation provides answers to these questions .    in the following",
    "we will solve the anderson - hubbard model using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) with geometric average over disorder .",
    "this non - perturbative approach is sensitive to anderson localization @xcite even on a one - particle level @xcite and treats disorder and interactions within a unified theoretical framework @xcite . replacing the arithmetic average employed in the coherent potential approximation @xcite by the geometric average over the disorder corresponds to the calculation of the typical local density of states ( ldos ) . indeed",
    ", other dmft studies of the anderson - hubbard model @xcite have shown that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the ldos approaches a log - normal distribution .",
    "for this pdf the geometric mean of random variables gives the most probable , i.e. _ typical _ , value .",
    "extended numerical investigations @xcite and experimental studies @xcite provided evidence that the log - normal distribution of the ldos is actually an immanent feature of fermions close to anderson localization .",
    "the dmft with geometric average has already been successfully employed to describe the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at @xmath1 in a variety of interacting models such as the hubbard model @xcite , the falicov - kimball model @xcite , or a charge - transfer model @xcite , in the presence of disorder .",
    "it has also been used to examine the mit in the paramagnetic , disordered hubbard model at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "the anderson - hubbard model at half filling on a bipartite lattice with spin - dependent diagonal disorder is given by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron at site @xmath5 and spin projection @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the particle number operator , and @xmath8 is the on - site repulsion . the hopping amplitude @xmath9 is non - zero only between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath10 . due to this property",
    "the lattice is composed of two interpenetrating sublattices @xmath11 .    the local spin - dependent potentials @xmath12 are uncorrelated random variables drawn from a pdf @xmath13 .",
    "similar to our previous studies @xcite , the spin - dependent disorder is modeled by a box - shaped pdf given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the heaviside step function and @xmath16 is the strength of the disorder .",
    "this means that the particles with spin up propagate on a lattice with randomly distributed on - site potentials , whereas the spin - down particles move on an energetically uniform lattice .",
    "the pdf is the same on both sublattices , hence there is no dependence on the index @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .    in order to include af - lro within dmft one has to treat the two sublattices separately .",
    "hence for each sublattice @xmath17 the hamiltonian ( [ ah ] ) is mapped onto an ensemble of single - impurity anderson models @xmath18 with random , spin - dependent on - site energies @xmath19 drawn from the same pdf as in eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "the last two terms , describing the dispersion and the coupling of the bath fermions to the impurity , are sublattice dependent . within the dmft",
    "every site from sublattice @xmath20 is embedded in the bath composed of sites from sublattice @xmath21 and vice versa .",
    "the bath states are represented by a hybridization function @xmath22 which in the dmft is determined self - consistently in the following way : for each @xmath19 and sublattice @xmath17 we calculate the impurity green function @xmath23 by solving the hamiltonian ( [ aim ] ) , and then determine the ldos via @xmath24 next we find the geometrically averaged ldos @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the arithmetic average of @xmath27 .",
    "the real part of the averaged local green function is determined by the hilbert transform @xmath28 the local self - energy @xmath29 is then obtained from the @xmath30-integrated dyson equation @xmath31 the set of equations is closed by the hilbert transform , which on a bipartite lattice is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the noninteracting density of states ( dos ) , and @xmath34 denotes the sublattice opposite to @xmath17 .",
    "these equations are solved iteratively until self - consistency is reached .    in our calculations",
    "the noninteracting dos has the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bandwidth , and @xmath37 sets the energy unit . for this dos the analytic form of the hilbert transform",
    "is determined , and the local green functions are related to the hybridization functions , by @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the results were obtained by iteratively solving the dmft equations at zero temperature using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite . for this part",
    "the open source nrg ljubljana code @xcite was used .",
    "the ground state of the anderson - hubbard model eq .",
    "( [ ah ] ) with spin - dependent disorder on a bipartite lattice is determined by three factors : disorder , local repulsion , and af - lro . to characterize their influence",
    "two different quantities are computed : + a ) the geometrically averaged ldos @xmath39 for spin @xmath40 and sublattice @xmath17 , + b ) the staggered magnetization , i.e. the difference between the magnetizations on the sublattices , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of particles on sublattice @xmath17 with spin @xmath40 .",
    "the ldos obeys the symmetry condition @xmath43 which allows one , in principle , to restrict the calculations to one sublattice only .",
    "the energy scale is chosen such that @xmath44 corresponds to the fermi energy . with these quantities",
    "one may identify the following four different phases : + i ) a paramagnetic metal ( pm ) if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , + ii ) an antiferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , + iii ) a spin - selective localized phase of type i ( sslp - i ) if @xmath49 but @xmath50 when @xmath48 , + iv ) a spin - selective localized phase of type ii ( sslp - ii ) if @xmath51 and @xmath52 when @xmath48 .",
    "+ we note that only in the pm phase there is no af - lro .    the magnetic ground state phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] is the main result of this investigation and will now be discussed in detail .",
    "the afi is characterized by the appearance of af - lro and zero ldos at the fermi energy in both spin channels and on every lattice site . in the absence of disorder ( @xmath53 )",
    "this phase is the only stable dmft solution for the half - filled hubbard model on a bipartite lattice at @xmath1 and any @xmath8 , due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "as we found earlier @xcite the presence of conventional disorder leads to the occurrence of pm and an antiferromagnetic metal at small @xmath8 whose regions of stability are surrounded by an afi in the phase diagram . in the case of spin",
    "- dependent disorder the afi phase also covers most of the phase diagram , but in a way different compared to the phase diagram of the anderson - hubbard model with conventional disorder @xcite .    for weak disorder ( @xmath54 )",
    "one can distinguish two types of antiferromagnetic insulators , namely , a slater insulator at weak interactions ( @xmath55 ) , where weak - coupling perturbation theory should be valid , and a mott - heisenberg insulator at strong interactions ( @xmath56 ) , where the effective hamiltonian of the system reduces to the heisenberg model @xcite . upon increasing the disorder",
    "we find that in both regimes the staggered magnetization @xmath57 drops to a very small value as is seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] for @xmath58 .     as a function of disorder strength @xmath16 for different interaction strengths @xmath8 .",

    "insets show zoomed regions around the fermi level.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    for stronger disorder ( @xmath60 ) the slater insulator turns into the sslp - i and the pm phase , as will be discussed later , whereas the mott - heisenberg insulator above @xmath61 remains stable for arbitrary strength of the disorder .",
    "then localization is expected to play a role since the disorder is no longer weak .",
    "therefore , this phase at @xmath56 and @xmath62 should rather be called `` anderson - mott - heisenberg insulator '' . in these interaction and disorder regimes",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath63 is very small as seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] .",
    "the low value of @xmath57 originates from its definition ( [ mstg ] ) where the occupation of extended states in the spectrum is taken into account .",
    "therefore , we now introduce the polarization @xmath64 , which is interpreted as a staggered magnetization normalized by the number of states in the extended part of the spectrum . as we see in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ polarization ] even the polarization remains small at strong disorder in comparison with the @xmath53 case .",
    "this strong reduction of both @xmath57 and @xmath65 is caused by the localization of particles in the presence of strong spin - dependent disorder , thereby diminishing the role of virtual exchange processes responsible for af - lro at large @xmath8 @xcite .     as a function of disorder strength @xmath16 for different values of the interaction @xmath8 .",

    "the relation @xmath66 holds .",
    "the sslp - i phase is characterized by rather small values of @xmath57 and @xmath65 , as we can see in figs .",

    "[ dos_u_0_20 ] .",
    "this means that particles with spin up , which are subject to disorder , are now in the metallic phase because the disorder redistributes spectral weight , thereby closing the gap for these fermions .",
    "by contrast the spin - down particles remain in the insulating state . in other words , particles with spin down , which are not directly affected directly by the spin - dependent disorder ,",
    "sustain the slater gap in the ldos due to af - lro .",
    "although the gap is closed in @xmath67 the asymmetry of the ldos in the two spin channels remains , giving rise to a finite value of @xmath57 .",
    "upon increasing the disorder strength further the pm becomes stable .",
    "it is characterized by the disappearance of af - lro and a non - zero ldos at the fermi energy for both spin species , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ dos_zero_d ] .",

    "this sslp - ii is a magnetic counterpart to the spin - selective localized phase found in the paramagnetic ground state phase diagram in ref .  .",
    "the origin of this phase can be explained as follows : strong spin - dependent disorder renormalizes the ldos of the spin - up particles and opens a gap at the fermi level due to the disorder - driven localization transition , thus forming two narrow , continuous subbands .",

    "we conclude that the transition from sslp - ii to afi is of the falicov - kimball type because the ldos for spin - down particles splits in a similar way as in the case of binary - alloy disorder , where particles with spin - up provide localized scattering centers @xcite .",
    "the slight reduction of the critical interaction from @xmath77 for the paramagnetic ground state discussed in ref .  , to @xmath78 in the case , studied here , is caused by the presence of af - lro which naturally tends to form a slater gap and slater subbands .",

    "[ afvspm ] , where we compared the ldos at @xmath71 and @xmath79 in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic dmft solutions , the af - lro leads to an asymmetric transfer of the spectral weight away from the fermi level and an earlier opening of the gap as compared with the paramagnetic case .",
