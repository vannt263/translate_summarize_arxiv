    "studies of the distribution of carbon monoxide ( co ) emission in external galaxies (  young & scoville @xcite ) have pointed to the presence of large quantities of molecular material in these objects .",
    "these studies have yielded a detailed picture of the molecular mass in many external galaxies .",
    "but , because emission from the abundant co molecule is generally dominated by radiative transfer effects , such as high optical depth , it is not a reliable monitor of the physical conditions , such as spatial density and kinetic temperature , quantities necessary to assess the potential for star formation .",
    "emission from less - abundant , higher - dipole moment molecules are better - suited to the task of deriving the spatial density and kinetic temperature of the dense gas in our and external galaxies .",
    "for this reason , emission line studies from a variety of molecules have been made toward mainly nearby galaxies ( see henkel  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) has proven to be a reliable density and kinetic temperature probe in galactic molecular clouds .",
    "existing measurements of the h@xmath0co @xmath2 and @xmath3 emission in a variety of galaxies by baan  ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and araya  ( @xcite ) have mainly concentrated on measurements of the @xmath2 transition .",
    "one of the goals of the present study was to obtain a uniform set of measurements of both k - doublet transitions with which the physical conditions , specifically the spatial density , in the extragalactic context could be derived . using the unique density selectivity of the k - doublet transitions of h@xmath0co within the framework of a radiative transfer model which incorporates the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation , we have measured the spatial density in a sample of galaxies exhibiting starburst phenomena and/or high infrared luminosity .",
    "our ammonia ( nh@xmath1 ) measurements of these same galaxies , together with our lvg model , provide kinetic temperature measurements which can further constrain the range of allowed densities derived from our h@xmath0co measurements .",
    "the galaxy selection criteria and summary measurement results are as follows : selection criteria : dec(j2000 ) @xmath9 ; l(60 @xmath10 m ) @xmath11 50 jy and/or bright hcn and co emission .",
    "h@xmath0co measurements summary : gbt @xmath12 = 51 arcsec ( @xmath13 = 2 cm ) and 153 arcsec ( @xmath13 = 6 cm ) ; 26 of 56 galaxies detected in at least one h@xmath0co transition ; @xmath2 emission / absorption = 6/19 ; @xmath3 emission / absorption = 1/13 ; 17 of 26 detections are new extragalactic discoveries of h@xmath0co .",
    "figure  [ fig : exgalsamples ] shows two examples of our h@xmath0co results .",
    "emission in either of the two h@xmath0co transitions in this study is a sign of high spatial density .",
    "observed emission in the h@xmath0co @xmath3 transition toward arp  220 signals a relatively high density ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "absorption in both h@xmath0co transitions toward ngc  253 , on the other hand , signals an average density that is lower ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "nh@xmath1 measurements summary : gbt @xmath12 = 30 ( @xmath13 = 1.3 cm ) arcsec ; 12 of 19 galaxies detected in at least one nh@xmath1 transition ; nh@xmath1 emission / absorption = 7/5 ; 4 of 12 detections are new extragalactic discoveries of nh@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : exgalsamples ] shows two examples of our nh@xmath1 measurement results . as these examples reveal , our nh@xmath1 measurements reveal both emission and absorption in the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 4,4 ) , and absorption in the ( 2,1 ) transition . _",
    "emission _ in the nh@xmath1 ( 2,1 ) transition is a hallmark of high infrared intensity (  morris  @xcite ) .",
    "nh@xmath1 ( 2,1 ) absorption , on the other hand , requires only a strong background continuum source .",
    "for the h@xmath0co sources in which we have detected both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions we have applied our technique to derive the spatial density assuming kinetic temperatures derived both from dust emission and our nh@xmath1 measurements ( table  [ tab : dentemps ] ) .",
    "noteworthy are the generally higher , and in a few cases _ much _ higher , kinetic temperatures derived using our nh@xmath1 measurements . in many cases these high kinetic temperatures have been previously noted (  ott  @xcite ) , pointing to the importance of a direct measurement of the kinetic temperature in these starburst environments .",
    "the h@xmath0co and nh@xmath1 measurements presented allow us to derive the kinetic temperature and spatial density in our starburst galaxy sample , representing the first mean density _ measurements _ made toward starburst galaxies .",
    "the disparity between kinetic temperature measurements derived assuming direct coupling to dust and those derived from our nh@xmath1 measurements points to the absolute need for direct gas kinetic temperature measurements using an appropriate molecular probe .",
    "finally , our spatial density measurements point to a rough constancy to the spatial density ( 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) in our starburst galaxy sample .",
    "this implies that the schmidt - kennicutt relation between l@xmath7 and m@xmath8 : ( 1 ) is a measure of the dense gas mass reservoir available to form stars , and ( 2 ) is not directly dependent upon a higher average density driving the star formation process in the most luminous starburst galaxies .",
