    "henry norris russell  ( 1948 ) once delivered a lecture here in cambridge entitled `` the royal road of eclipses , '' about the determination of accurate parameters for eclipsing binary stars , and the promise that such systems held for progress in stellar astrophysics .",
    "given the rapid progress on display at this meeting , it is clear that exoplanetary science too has its royal road : the royal road of transits .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the happy situation in which the planet s orbit is viewed nearly edge - on , and the planet undergoes transits and occultations .",

    "note : where more than one reference is listed , the value in column 2 is taken from the starred reference .    to date , rm observations have been reported for 11 different exoplanetary systems , since the pioneering detections by queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and bundy & marcy  ( 2000 ) .",
    "this field is at the transition point between a mere handful of results to a large enough sample for meaningful general conclusions to be drawn and for rare surprises to emerge .",
    "the results are summarized in table  2 , which is organized in order of measurement precision , with the most precise result listed first .",
    "figure  8 shows some more recent data for hd  189733 and hat - p-2 , both of which display the antisymmetric waveform indicative of a well - aligned spin and orbit ( at least in projection ) .",
    "both stars have candidate stellar companions , naturally raising the possibility of kozai cycles , but in both cases the projected spin - orbit angle is consistent with zero .        in almost all cases ,",
    "the results are consistent with good alignment , with measurement precisions ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "there are two possible exceptions .",
    "the first is hd  17156 , for which narita et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported @xmath2 .",
    "however , shortly after this meeting , cochran et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented new data giving @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for the apparently significant disagreement between the data sets is not yet clear .",
    "the other possible exception is xo-3 , for which hbrard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found @xmath4  deg , i.e. , a transverse rm effect in which only an anomalous blueshift was seen .",
    "those authors expressed some caution about the result due to possible systematic errors .",
    "further observations of both of these systems are warranted .",
    "broadly speaking , the results show that large spin - orbit misalignments are fairly rare .",
    "the time is now ripe for a statistical analysis of the ensemble results .",
    "this would not only overcome the sky - projection limitation that is inherent in individual results , but could ultimately place constraints on the fraction of systems that have migrated via different channels .",
    "a possible confounding factor is tidal coplanarization : even if the migration process resulted in a large value of @xmath5 , could the system have been eventually realigned by star - planet tidal interactions ?",
    "the simple and widely - used model of tidal interactions , in which the equilibrium tidal bulge is shifted by a constant time lag , suggests that the timescale for inclination damping is much longer than the timescale for eccentricity damping , and that tidal spin - orbit realignment can be neglected ( winn et al .",
    "however , more theoretical work is needed to go beyond this order - of - magnitude argument and define the scope for more complicated tidal and evolutionary models to affect the interpretation of the rm results .",
    "it is possible , for example , that tidal dynamics were more important when the system was younger , or that the coplanarization timescale is shorter than expected ( mazeh 2008 ) .",
    "special thanks are due to d.  fabrycky for producing fig .  6 , to a.  pl for providing the numerical results in fig .  4 ( which are more complete than the results i showed in my presentation ) , and to k.  de  kleer for help in producing fig .",

    "i am grateful to the soc for the opportunity to speak at the woodstock of transiting planets .",
