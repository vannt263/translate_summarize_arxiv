    "in @xcite , brunnthaler et al . presented a method for synthesizing closed kinematic chains of four revolute joints whose coupler can visit three prescribed poses ( position and orientation ) .",
    "these linkages are also known under the name `` bennett linkage '' . by that time",
    ", it was already known that three poses in general position define a unique bennett linkage .",
    "other synthesis methods were available @xcite .",
    "with hindsight , the most important novelty of @xcite was the characterization of the coupler motions of bennett linkages as conics in the study quadric model of the direct euclidean displacement group @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the precise concept of `` bennett linkages '' , it might be necessary to exclude certain conics , see @xcite .",
    "this interpretation allows to immediately construct the _ coupler motion _ from the three given poses  even before the linkage itself is determined .    in this article",
    ", we generalize the method of @xcite to the four - pose synthesis of special kinematic loops of six revolute joints ( 6r linkages ) .",
    "our main tool is the recently developed technique of factoring rational motions @xcite , or more precisely , motion polynomials .",
    "this allows to decompose a rational parametrized equation in study parameters into the product of linear factors .",
    "each such factorization gives rise to an open kinematic chain .",
    "suitable combinations of open chains produce closed loop linkages whose coupler follows the prescribed rational motion .",
    "if we combine this factorization of rational motions with rational interpolation techniques on a quadric , we obtain a framework for mechanism synthesis .",
    "it requires the completion of three steps :    * @xmath1interpolate @xmath2 given poses by a rational motion of degree @xmath3 , parametrized by a motion polynomial @xmath4 .",
    "* @xmath1factor the motion polynomial @xmath4 and combine different factorizations to form a closed loop linkage .",
    "* @xmath1pick a suitable linkage from the resulting family of solutions .",
    "the mentioned synthesis of bennett linkages corresponds to @xmath5 poses and motion polynomials of degree @xmath6 .",
    "the motion polynomial @xmath4 admits two factorizations in two linear factors , each of which determines one fixed and one moving axis .",
    "these axes can be determined by geometric arguments as in @xcite or by a straightforward algorithmic procedure ( see algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] below ) .",
    "the latter method extends to motions of higher degree .",
    "an important aspect of the suggested synthesis procedure is the fact that the mechanism is constructed from its coupler motion .",
    "thus , optimal synthesis is not restricted to linkage characteristics only .",
    "it is possible and advisable to optimize the coupler motion as well .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the case @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the reason for this is that , at least in general , higher degree motion polynomials result in multi - looped spatial linkages which are probably too complicated for most engineering applications . in case of @xmath8",
    "we obtain a certain class of overconstrained single looped 6r linkages with a single degree of freedom .",
    "we continue this text be recalling some basic concepts of motion polynomials in . in",
    "we describe algorithmic aspects of the factorization algorithm of @xcite . in we",
    "show how to interpolate four points on the study quadric by twisted cubics and in we discuss some properties of the resulting linkages and make suggestions for picking feasible solutions .",
    "illustrates the complete algorithm at hand of a comprehensive example .",
    "we parametrize the group @xmath0 of direct euclidean displacements by unit dual quaternions with non - vanishing primal part .",
    "the use of dual quaternions in mechanism synthesis is not new .",
    "see @xcite for an example and more pointers to the relevant literature .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts and suggest @xcite as a further reference .",
    "the group @xmath0 is isomorphic to the factor group of unit dual quaternions modulo @xmath9 .",
    "this means that every direct euclidean displacement corresponds to two unit dual quaternions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of non - zero primal part in such a way that composition of displacements corresponds to dual quaternion multiplication .    in order",
    "to get rid of the ambiguity in the representation of elements of @xmath0 , one can factor by the real numbers and not just by @xmath12 . in this way",
    ", we arrive at the real projective space @xmath13 .",
    "the unit norm condition reduces to the non - vanishing of the primal part and the vanishing of the dual part .",
    "the latter , a homogeneous quadratic form , defines the so - called _ study quadric @xmath14 , _ the former defines the _ exceptional three - space @xmath15 . _",
    "the image of @xmath0 under this kinematic map is @xmath16 .",
    "homogeneous coordinates in @xmath13 are called study parameters . in this context",
    ", a motion is a curve on @xmath14 , possibly with isolated points in @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in rational motions .",
    "these are defined by polynomial parametrizations in study parameters or , equivalently , by motion polynomials .    essentially , a motion polynomial is the parametrized equation of a rational motion in dual quaternions .",
    "more formally , we have :    [ def:1 ] a left polynomial @xmath17 with dual quaternion coefficients is called a _ motion polynomial _ if @xmath18 is a real polynomial , if its leading coefficient equals @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is greater than zero .",
    "the condition on the leading coefficient is merely a technicality and constitutes no loss of generality .",

    "the non - commutativity of dual quaternion multiplication entails some subtleties . to begin with , in the multiplication of two polynomials in",
    "@xmath22 $ ] the indeterminate @xmath21 commutes , _ by definition , _ with all coefficients .",
    "this implies that there is a difference between left polynomials , with coefficients written to the left of the indeterminate , and right polynomials where coefficients are on the right .",
    "we consistently use left polynomials but often omit the additional word `` left '' . the sequence of polynomial multiplication matters and",
    "must strictly be obeyed in the algorithms we present below .",
    "a dual quaternion @xmath23 is called a rotation quaternion if it describes a rotation and a translation quaternion , if it describes a translation .",
    "rotation quaternions are characterized by orthogonality of primal and dual part ( study condition ) , vanishing dual scalar part and non vanishing primal vector part .",
    "translation quaternions are characterized by the study condition , vanishing dual scalar part , vanishing primal vector part and non - vanishing primal scalar part . in this text",
    ", we will usually not encounter translation quaternions as we describe numeric procedures that produce translation quaternions with negligible probability .",
    "a polynomial with real coefficients admits an essentially unique factorization into linear factors over the complex numbers . the situation for polynomials with dual quaternion coefficients is fundamentally different .",
    "because of the non - commutative multiplication , a possible factorization is , in general , not unique .",
    "the defining conditions for motion polynomials ( definition  [ def:1 ] ) guarantees the existence of several special factorizations , at least in generic cases .",

    "here , the term `` generic '' refers to the non - vanishing of the primal part of @xmath4 .",
    "usually , zeros of @xmath28 turn some of the rotation quaternions into translation quaternions .",
    "motion polynomials that admit no factorization do exist .",
    "although their precise characterization is not known , it is already clear that they are too special to be of real relevance in synthesis procedures .",
    "the total number @xmath25 of factorizations comes from permutations of the conjugate complex root pairs of the _ norm polynomial _",
    "@xmath18 of degree @xmath29 ( compare algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] below ) . if some of these root pairs coincide , the actual number of factorizations may be less . again",

    "different factorizations give rise to different open chains that can be combined to form closed loop linkages . using factorization of motion polynomials ,",

    "for example the call of @xmath65 for each recursive call could be avoided because it produces only a subset of the call at the previous recursion level .",

    "here , the symbol `` @xmath71 '' means equality in projective sense , that is , up to multiplication with a non - zero real scalar .",
    "since the study parameters are homogeneous , this can be seen as a particular instance of rational interpolation problem on quadrics @xcite .",
    "we are not interested in all aspect of this topic .",
    "in particular , the restriction to interpolants of degree @xmath72 is a considerable simplification .",
    "the case @xmath73 ( interpolation by conics ) is even simpler and there is no need to address it here . it has been extensively treated in @xcite",
    ".    we will study in more detail the interpolation of four points @xmath74 on the study quadric @xmath75 by a rational cubic interpolant @xmath4 contained in @xmath14 . doing so , we will always assume that the four points @xmath76 have a projective span @xmath36 of dimension three . in order to exclude spherical or planar motions and particularities of translational joints , we assume that @xmath36 is not contained in @xmath14 and does not intersect the exceptional generator @xmath15 .",
    "this last assumption is not really necessary but simplifies our exposition .",
    "finally , it is helpful to set @xmath77 .",
    "this entails @xmath78 and can always be achieved by a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "several methods for solving the interpolation problem are conceivable .",
    "we describe an approach that fits well to our dual quaternion based setting .",
    "it is possible that no solution exists .",
    "this happens if the intersection @xmath79 contains no real twisted cubics .",
    "since @xmath80 is a real quadric in a projective three space , a simple criterion for the existence of cubics on @xmath80 is the existence of straight lines on @xmath80 .",
    "we can test this by computing the straight lines on @xmath80 through @xmath77 .",
    "any point @xmath81 on a straight line @xmath82 through @xmath19 is generically a rotation quaternion or , in special cases , a translation quaternionk in our description we ignore the latter possibility .",
    "rotation quaternions have a purely vectorial dual part .",
    "different points on the same line @xmath83 correspond to different rotations about the same axes .",
    "the involutory rotations ( half - turns ) are characterized by a purely vectorial primal part .    in order to compute the half - turn quaternions in @xmath36 , we set @xmath84 .",
    "the two half - turn conditions require the vanishing of the scalar part of @xmath81 .",
    "this gives two linear conditions , the study quadric condition gives one quadratic conditions .",
    "thus , we end up with a system of a quadratic and two linear equations for the homogeneous unknowns @xmath85 .",
    "it is easy to compute its up to two real solutions . in case of no real solution",
    ", the interpolation problem can not be solved .",
    "the case of two real solutions is dealt with in the next section .",
    "the non - generic case of one solution is amenable to synthesis in the line of this article but , for reasons of compact presentation , will be ignored in the following .",
    "we did not only compute the two half - turns @xmath86 in order to test existence of solutions .",
    "we can also use them for actually computing interpolants .",
    "the quadric @xmath80 is doubly ruled , the span @xmath87 of @xmath19 and @xmath88 belongs to one family of rulings and the span @xmath89 of @xmath19 and @xmath90 to the other .",
    "our aim is to find a twisted cubic interpolating @xmath91 .",
    "it is well - known that each such cubic intersects every member of one family of rulings in one point and each member of the other family in two points @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we have to deal with two completely symmetric situations .",
    "we describe the case where the cubic intersects @xmath87 twice and @xmath89 once .    the second intersection point @xmath92 of @xmath87 and",
    "the cubic can be written as @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "we use @xmath95 to parametrize all solution cubics in this family .",
    "the key observation is now that any rational cubic parametrization of the sought curve is induced , via the rulings in the family of @xmath89 , by a linear rational parametrization of any ruling in the family of @xmath87 .",
    "hence , we compute parameter values @xmath96 such that @xmath97 is the intersection point of a ruling through @xmath98 with @xmath87 for @xmath99 . the values @xmath100 will be the parameter values at which the cubic curve interpolates the given points on the study quadric .",
    "this is necessarily so , up to admissible change of parameter via a fractional linear re - parametrization . for the computation of",
    "@xmath96 we have to evaluate the linear condition @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the quadratic form associated to the study quadric .",
    "the value @xmath103 can not occur because of @xmath104 , @xmath99 .",
    "setting @xmath78 , we end up with five points @xmath105 and corresponding parameter values @xmath106 , chosen in such a way that a cubic interpolant exists .",
    "now we can use a standard interpolation algorithm to find a cubic interpolant @xmath17 such that @xmath69 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this interpolant still depends on the parameter @xmath95 . by construction",
    ", the polynomial @xmath17 is a motion polynomial .",
    "by combining the results of and [ sec : computing - solutions ] we are , under certain mild assumptions , able to interpolate four given points @xmath109 by two one - parametric families of rational cubic curves , parametrized by motion polynomials @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and factor each of these cubic polynomials , in six different ways , as @xmath112 with rotation quaternions @xmath113 .",
    "each triple @xmath114 of rotation quaternions corresponds to an open 3r chain that can reach the given poses @xmath67 . suitably combining two such chains gives a candidate 6r linkage for our synthesis problem .",
    "however , there are invalid combinations of open 3r chains that should be avoided . recall that each factorization obtained by algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] corresponds to an ordering of the set @xmath115 of quadratic factors of the norm polynomial @xmath18 .",
    "we must not combine factorizations with the same quadratic factor at the first or the last position , as this produces a dangling link attached to either the end - effector or the base . on the level of factorizations ,",
    "this can be distinguished by identical factors on the right or on the left .",
    "six among the 15 possible combinations are afflicted with this defect . in order to exclude invalid linkages",
    "a priori , it is necessary that the @xmath65 procedure returns a list of factors that is sorted with respect to some total ordering relation .",
    "thus , a consistent ordering of factors in recursive calls of @xmath116 is guaranteed . in this case ,",
    "algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] returns a list @xmath117 $ ] of six factorizations in which the index pairs @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 represent valid combinations .",
    "three of these pairs , @xmath120 , @xmath122 , and @xmath124 , give rise to `` general angle symmetric linkages '' and six give rise to linkages of type `` waldron s double bennett hybrid '' @xcite .    at this point , we are left with two one - parametric families of six factorizations , each giving rise to nine candidate linkage .",
    "we should thus provide some method to pick `` good '' or at least `` suitable '' linkages from this variety . before embarking on this",
    ", it must be said that a mathematical optimization on either of the families of solutions is problematic . in the description of",
    ", one family is parametrized by @xmath127 .",
    "since the actual computation of a solution requires the factorization of a real polynomial of degree six and a subsequent polynomial division , differentiation with respect to @xmath95 is difficult if not infeasible . however , since the solution space is only of dimension one , a straightforward line search is possible with reasonable effort .",
    "an important aspect in many synthesis problems is to guarantee a certain interpolation sequence . in the instance",
    "we describe , this is , unfortunately , not possible . from the construction in , it is obvious that the interpolation times @xmath128 for the four given points are independent from the parameter @xmath95 that determines the cubic interpolant . within one family of solutions ,",
    "the given poses are visited at exactly the same parameter times .",
    "the free parameters alone can not be used to resolve a possible order defect . the only way to remedy this ,",
    "is to change the input poses @xmath67 .",
    "a specialty of the proposed procedure is the intermediate construction of possible end - effector motions from which the mechanism is synthesized .",
    "this adds an important ingredient to the problem of finding optimal linkages . not only should certain linkage characteristics be satisfactory but the end - effector motion should be acceptable as well .",
    "this brings our topic in the vicinity of motion fairing @xcite and the construction of fair motions @xcite",
    ". however , applicability of these established research topics to our problem should not be over - estimated .",
    "we do not recommend to waste our single free parameter on a fair coupler motion alone .",
    "it should also be used to produce satisfactory linkage properties .",
    "thus , we use a suitable fairness functional only for eliminating linkages with bad coupler motion .",
    "the example in below shows how this might work in applications .",
    "it is for this reason , that particular features or possible defects of the fairness functional , like dependence on chosen coordinate frames or disparity of translational and rotational units , are of minor relevance to us . in our example in we use a very simple energy functional on the trajectories of certain feature points .",
    "once candidate linkages with unfavorable end - effector motion have been eliminated , we can turn our attention to properties of the linkage itself .",
    "we suggest to compute the usual denavit - hartenberg parameters distances , angles , and offsets . from distances and offsets , it is possible to estimate the overall size of the linkage and exclude excessively large solutions .",
    "small angles indicate a relatively `` planar '' spatial linkage , which might also be desirable in some cases .",
    "while these are general considerations that also pertain to other types of linkages , we also suggest a quality measure that is tailored to linkages synthesized by factorization of cubic motion polynomials .",
    "it is related to the joint angles @xmath129 and",
    "@xmath130 at which the first and the last input pose are attained . in order to understand their relation to the interpolation parameter times @xmath131 and @xmath132 , we consider a rotation quaternion @xmath23 and the parametrization @xmath133 of its rotations .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath134 at parameter time @xmath31 is given by the formula @xmath135 this formula has interesting consequences .",
    "the polynomial @xmath136 is the _ minimal polynomial _ of @xmath23the unique monic left polynomial of degree two with @xmath137 . in @xcite , we showed that if @xmath133 occurs in the factorization of a motion polynomial @xmath17 , than @xmath138 is the corresponding factor of @xmath18 . by algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] ,",
    "the rotation angles in two open 3r chains obtained through factorization of the same motion polynomial are permutations of each other .",
    "this implies existence of three joint pairs whose _ input - output relation is the identity .",
    "_ this was also observed in @xcite and is the reason for the title of this paper .",
    "equation   implies that the rotation angle is strictly monotone and the linkage has full cycle mobility , at least generically .",
    "( these properties can not be guaranteed if two consecutive revolute axes coincide .",
    "the rotation angle in this joint is then the sum of two rotation angles which may result in rocking joints . )",
    "this behavior of the joint angle functions is certainly a pleasant property of the synthesized linkages .",
    "it also suggests to use the angle increment in each joint between the first and last pose as a possible optimization target . in other words",
    ", the motion from @xmath139 to @xmath140 via @xmath141 and @xmath142 should be accomplished by small rotations in the six joints .",
    "of course , this only makes sense , if the resulting linkage is not required to perform the full cycle end - effector motion .",
    "since , by construction , the first pose is the identity and corresponds to zero rotation in all joints , we have to minimize the norm of the vector @xmath143 of joint angles associated with @xmath144 . for this approach",
    "the following remarks hold true :    * @xmath1the set of rotation angles is independent from the particular factorization of @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , it can be computed from the factors of @xmath18 alone and without running algorithm  [ alg : factorization ] . *",
    "@xmath1when using the maximum norm , the angle @xmath145 can be replaced by @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the corresponding rotation quaternion .",
    "again , @xmath150 can be computed directly from the factors of the norm polynomial  @xmath18 .",
    "we call it the factor s _ angle characteristic_. the assumption is that small rotations and sensible axis layout also produce good coupler motions in the range between @xmath139 and  @xmath140 . *",
    "@xmath1an optimal solution in this sense is associated to the motion polynomial @xmath17 , not to a linkage .",
    "it is still necessary to make a choice from the nine linkages produced by the different factorizations of  @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we discuss different aspects of a particular synthesis problem . it is meant as an illustration of the general synthesis process and also as an example of how to incorporate the ideas of the preceding section in a synthesis pipeline .",
    "we want to synthesize an overconstrained 6r linkage to the four poses @xmath151 at first , we compute the two half - turn quaternions @xmath152 @xmath90 in the span of @xmath139 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath140 .",
