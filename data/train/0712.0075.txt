    "the prediction of a possible existence of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) was one of the best theoretical achievements of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at non - zero temperatures and densities ( the rather full list of the corresponding references can be found in the text - book on finite - temperature field theory in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite as well ) .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for the qgp has been derived analytically up to the order @xmath3 by using the perturbation theory ( pt ) expansion for the evaluation of the corresponding thermodynamical potential term by term ( @xcite and references therein ) .    however , the most characteristic feature of this pt expansion is its non - analytical dependence on the qcd coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , this means that the pt qcd is not applicable at finite temperatures , apart from maybe at very high temperatures .",
    "the problem is not in poor convergence of this series @xcite ( in mathematics there exist methods how to improve convergence ) .",
    "the problem is that in the case of the above - mentioned non - analytical dependence one can not even define the radius of convergence , so any next calculated term can be bigger than the previous one .",
    "this is the principle problem which can be resolved by no means . from the strictly mathematical point of view",
    "the four - dimensional qcd at non - zero temperatures effectively becomes the three - dimensional theory . at the same time",
    ", the three - dimensional qcd has much more severe infrared singularities @xcite and its coupling constant becomes dimensional .",
    "that is the reason why the dependence becomes not analytical , while using the dimensionless coupling constat @xmath4 ( one needs to introduce three different scales , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the temperature in order to somehow understand the dynamics of the qgp within the thermal pt qcd approach ) .",
    "thus there is an exact indication that the analytical eos derived by thermal pt qcd is wrong .    at present , the only method to be used in order to investigate thermal qcd is the lattice qcd at finite temperature and baryon density which underwent a rapid recent progress ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the lattice qcd , being a very specific regularization scheme , first of all is aimed at obtaining the well - defined corresponding expressions in order to get correct numbers from them .",
    "so , one gets numbers , but not understanding on what is going on .",
    "such kind of understanding can only come from the dynamical theory which is continuous qcd .",
    "for example , any description of the qgp is to be formulated in the framework of the dynamical theory .",
    "the lattice thermal qcd is useless in this .",
    "the need in the analytical eos remains , but , of course it should be essentially non - perturbative ( np ) , reproducing the thermal pt qcd results at a very high temperature only .",
    "thus analytic np qcd and lattice qcd approaches to finite - temperature qcd do not exclude each other , but contrary they should complement each other . especially this is true for low temperatures where lattice qcd calculations suffer from big uncertainties @xcite .",
    "there already exist an interesting analytic approaches based on quasi - particle and liquid model pictures @xcite to analyze results of @xmath0 lattice qcd calculations for the qgp eos .",
    "the formalism we are going to use in order to generalize it to non - zero temperature is the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite .",
    "it is essentially np from the very beginning , since it is dealing with the expansion of the corresponding skeleton loop contributions ( for more detail description see section 2 and ref .",
    "@xcite as well , where it has been generalized on quark degrees of freedom , but not using the confinement - type solution for the quark propagator ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive eos for the gluon matter by introducing the temperature dependence into the effective potential approach in a self - consistent way , in particular by using the confinement - type solution for the full gluon propagator ( see below ) .",
    ", while the solid lines  the full quark propagators @xmath8 . @xmath9 is the full quark - gluon vertex , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the full three- and four - gluon vertices , respectively .",
    "the ghost skeleton loops are not shown explicitly.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]        the quantum part of the vacuum energy density ( ved ) is determined by the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite . in the absence of external sources the effective potential is nothing but the ved .",
    "it is given in the form of the skeleton loop expansion , containing all the types of the qcd full propagators and vertices , see fig .",
    "so each vacuum skeleton loop itself is a sum of an infinite number of the corresponding pt vacuum loops , i.e. , it contains the point - like vertices and free propagators ( see fig .",
    "2 , where one term only in each lower order is shown , for simplicity ) .",
    "the number of the vacuum skeleton loops is equal to the power of the planck constant , @xmath12 .",
    "here we are going to formulate a general method of numerical calculation of the quantum part of the truly np yang - mills ( ym ) ved in the covariant gauge qcd .",
    "the gluon part of the ved to leading order ( the so - called log - loop level @xmath13 , the first skeleton loop diagram in fig . 1 , and which pt expansion is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "2 ) is analytically given by the effective potential for composite operators as follows @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the full gluon propagator and @xmath16 is its free counterpart ( see below ) .",
    "traces over space - time and color group indices are assumed . evidently , the effective potential is normalized to @xmath17 .",
    "next - to - leading and higher order contributions ( two and more vacuum skeleton loops ) are suppressed at least by one order of magnitude in powers of @xmath12 .",
    "they reproduce very small numerical corrections to the log - loop terms , and thus are not important for the numerical calculation of the ved to leading order .",
    "the two - point green s function , describing the full gluon propagator , is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the gauge - fixing parameter and    @xmath20    its free pt counterpart @xmath21 is obtained by putting the full gluon form factor @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) simply to one , i.e. ,    @xmath23    in order to evaluate the effective potential ( 2.1 ) , on account of eqs .",

    "( 2.6 ) is already a colorless quantity , since it has been already summed over color indices .",
    "also , only the transversal ( `` physical '' ) degrees of freedom of gauge bosons contribute to this equation , so there is no need for ghosts to cancel their longitudinal ( unphysical ) counterparts .",
    "however , the derived expression ( 2.6 ) remains rather formal , since it suffers from different types of the pt contributions ( `` contaminations '' ) . in order to define the truly np ved free of all the above - mentioned problems ,",
    "let us make first the identical transformation of the full effective charge in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) as follows :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 correctly describes the pt structure of the full effective charge @xmath32 , including its behavior in the ultra - violet ( uv ) limit , compatible with asymptotic freedom ( af ) phenomenon in qcd @xcite ) , otherwise remaining arbitrary . on the other hand , @xmath33 defined by the above - made subtraction , is assumed to reproduce correctly the np structure of the full effective charge , including its asymptotic in the deep infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "this underlines the strong intrinsic influence of the ir properties of the theory on its np dynamics . evidently , both terms are valid in the whole energy / momentum range , i.e. , they are not asymptotics .",
    "let us also emphasize the principle difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the former is np quantity `` contaminated '' by the pt contributions , while the latter one , being also np , is , nevertheless , free of them .",
    "thus the separation between the truly np effective charge @xmath33 and its nontrivial pt counterpart @xmath31 is achieved .",
    "for example , if the full effective charge explicitly depends on the scale responsible for the truly np dynamics in qcd , say @xmath34 , then one can define the subtraction    @xmath35    which is obviously equivalent to the decomposition ( 2.7 ) . in this way",
    "the above - mentioned separation becomes exact and unique as well ( for such concrete example see below ) .",
    "let us emphasize that the dependence of the full effective charge @xmath36 on @xmath34 can be only regular .",
    "otherwise it is impossible to assign to it the above - mentioned physical meaning , since @xmath34 can be only zero ( the formal pt limit ) or finite , i.e. , it can not be infinitely large . in principle , in some special models of the qcd vacuum , for example such as the abelian higgs model @xcite , the np scale is to be identified with the mass of the dual gauge boson .",
    "let us note that if there is no exact criterion how to distinguish between the truly np and the nontrivial pt parts in the full effective charge as described above , then it is possible from the full effective charge to subtract its uv asymptotic only .",
    "evidently , in this case the separation between the truly np and the nontrivial pt parts may not be unique .",
    "substituting the above - discussed exact decomposition ( 2.7 ) into eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) , introducing further the effective scale squared , separating the np region from the pt one ( soft momenta from hard momenta ) , and omitting some algebraic rearrangements ( see refs . @xcite and especially recent paper @xcite for details ) ,",
    "one obtains    @xmath37    here evidently @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the bag constant at zero temperature @xcite .",

    "@xmath44    because @xmath33 and @xmath45 are the truly np and the nontrivial pt effective charges , respectively , as it follows from above .",
    "precisely these expressions should be generalized to non - zero temperatures in order to get eos for the pure ym fields .",
    "that is why we introduce the dependence on the temperature @xmath5 in advance .",
    "evidently , eq . ( 3.2 ) will reproduce the temperature - dependent bag constant . in the expression for @xmath41",
    "the integration is from zero to infinity , while in the integral for @xmath40 it is from zero to the effective scale squared @xmath46 , which just symbolically shown in eq .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a so defined bag constant ( 3.2 ) is free of all types of pt contributions ( `` contaminations '' ) , as it is required ( this was a reason for the above - mentioned algebraic rearrangements and subtractions , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the problem remaining to solve is to choose the truly np effective charge @xmath47 . for the different truly np effective charges we will get different analytical and numerical results . that is why the choice for its explicit expression should be physically and mathematically well justified .",
    "let us choose the truly np effective charge as follows :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the mass scale parameter ( the mass gap ) responsible for the large - scale structure of the true qcd vacuum .",
    "it is well known that in continuous qcd it leads to the linear rising potential between heavy quarks , `` seen '' by lattice qcd @xcite as well ( @xmath50-type behavior for the full gluon propagator ) . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been explicitly shown that it is a direct nonlinear iteration solution of the transcendental equation for the full gluon propagator in the presence of a renormalized mass gap . the separation between the truly np and",
    "the nontrivial pt effective charges is both exact and unique , since the pt effective charge is always regular at zero , while the truly np effective is singular at the origin ( in the formal pt limit ( @xmath51 ) the truly np effective charge vanishes , while its nontrivial pt counterpart will survive ) .",
    "let us also note that the chosen effective charge ( 3.5 ) does not depend explicitly on the gauge choice .",
    "it has been already used @xcite in order to calculate the bag constant , which turned out to be in a very good agreement with such important phenomenological parameter as the gluon condensate .",
    "it leads to many other desirable properties for the bag pressure at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , our choice ( 3.5 ) is physically justified and mathematically confirmed , as required above .    in the imaginary time",
    "formalism @xcite , these expressions can be easily generalized to non - zero temperatures @xmath5 according to the prescription ( let us remind that there is already euclidean signature )    @xmath52    i.e. , each integral over @xmath53 of the loop momentum is to be replaced by the sum over matsubara frequencies labelled by @xmath54 , which obviously assumes the replacement @xmath55 for bosons ( gluons ) . in frequency - momentum space",

    "<S> in order to derive equation of state for the pure @xmath0 yang - mills fields from first principles , it is proposed to generalize the effective potential approach for composite operators to non - zero temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it is essentially non - perturbative by construction , since it assumes the summation of an infinite number of the corresponding contributions . </S>",
    "<S> there is no dependence on the coupling constant , only a dependence on the mass gap , which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state generalizes the bag constant at non - zero temperatures , while its nontrivial yang - mills part has been approximated by the generalization of the free gluon propagator to non - zero temperatures , as a first necessary step . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> we were able to show explicitly that the pressure may almost continuously change its regime at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all the other thermodynamical quantities such as energy density , entropy , etc . </S>",
    "<S> are to be understood to have drastic changes in their regimes in the close vicinity of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all this is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with thermal lattice qcd results for the pure yang - mills fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have firmly established the behavior of all the thermodynamical quantities in the region of low temperatures , where thermal lattice qcd calculations suffer from big uncertainties . </S>"
