    "in the last several years , double - layer electron and hole systems have provided an exceptionally useful tool for investigating the effects of interparticle coulomb interactions in two dimensions , particularly at low particle densities where exchange and correlation effects are significant .",
    "this has been especially true in the quantum hall regime,@xcite where the combination of a strong perpendicular magnetic field ( which quenches the kinetic energy ) and very small layer separation ( which enhances interlayer exchange ) stabilizes remarkable interlayer - coherent quantum hall states.@xcite even in the absence of any magnetic field , interlayer capacitance and drag measurements in double - layer electron systems ( 2les s ) have provided quantitative measures of the effects of electronic interactions on both the thermodynamics@xcite and transport ( coulomb drag@xcite ) of two - dimensional electron and hole systems .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we shall take the notation 2les to also include double - layer hole systems .",
    "our work is motivated by the rapid pace of advancements in the engineering of double - layer semiconductor devices .",
    "we expect that high - mobility double - layer devices will eventually be built with both ( 1 ) _ separately contactable _ layers , and ( 2 ) layer separations and carrier densities so small that the _ interlayer _ correlations between the carriers are substantial , perhaps even without the aid of a strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "such devices will allow direct measurements of the effects interlayer many - body effects in double - layer systems . as a starting point to analyze the zero magnetic field situation , we have developed a simple mean - field model that incorporates both intralayer and interlayer exchange in biased double - layer electron and hole systems in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "we use the model to calculate theoretically the effect of interlayer exchange on the layer densities and interlayer capacitance as a function of layer spacing , particle density , and applied gate voltage .",
    "gated double - layer systems have the great advantage of allowing the layer densities of electrons or holes to be varied by the application of a bias ( gate voltage ) . at high densities ,",
    "the kinetic energy per unit area dominates the exchange and correlation energies , and in a translationally invariant system , the symmetry and properties of the ground state of a many - body system are in one - to - one correspondence with those of a free - electron gas . at lower electron densities , the coulombic exchange and correlation energies can produce qualitative changes in the nature of the many - particle ground state : numerical work on two- and three - dimensional electron gases show that a spin ferromagnetic state is obtained at low densities , which is eventually supplanted by a wigner crystal state at the lowest densities .",
    "the low - density ferromagnetic state of the interacting electron gas was anticipated some 70 years ago by bloch;@xcite ferromagnetism can be found even within the hartree - fock approximation when the exchange interaction energy , which favors occupation of single - particle states of the same spin , dominates the kinetic energy , which favors reducing the fermi energy by equal occupation of both spin states .",
    "multilayer semiconductor devices enhance the effects of interparticle interactions through the combination of reduced dimensionality and low particle density , and by the presence of an additional electronic degree of freedom , the layer index.@xcite in double - layer systems , layer occupancy can be specified by a introducing a pseudospin variable that points up for one layer and down for the other layer.@xcite extending the notion of an exchange - driven ferromagnetic transition to double - layer systems suggests that at low enough densities , the electronic ground state should be both spin and pseudospin polarized .",
    "such reasoning , supported by hartree - fock calculations , led ruden and wu to propose that , at low enough electron densities and for small enough layer separations , the electrons of a 2les would minimize their ground - state energy by having all electrons occupy a single layer.@xcite the ruden - wu scenario implies that as the total density of a balanced 2les is lowered , the electrons should eventually experience an interlayer charge transfer instability that spontaneously empties out one of the two layers .",
    "ruden and wu also suggested that the inherent bistability of the resulting low - density 2les ( either layer could be the one to lose or gain particles ) would constitute an exchange - driven logic gate .",
    "the possibility of an exchange - driven interlayer charge - transfer instability has been a subject of both theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite interest .",
    "although pseudospin polarization at sufficiently low densities is likely , it does not require unequal layer densities .",
    "this has been demonstrated theoretically in great detail for closely spaced double - layer systems in a strong magnetic field at unit filling factor and appears to give a good explanation of experimental results.@xcite the key point is that electrons in double - layer structures are not restricted to occupying only one of two layer eigenstates : quantum mechanics allows states that are superpositions of the two layers .",
    "the layer pseudospin must therefore be treated as a heisenberg variable , as was done in refs . and in the quantum hall regime , and by zheng and co - workers in zero magnetic field,@xcite rather than as an ising variable ( where only `` up '' and `` down '' allowed ) as was done by ruden and wu .",
    "for example , when interlayer tunneling is present , the single - particle eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of layer states . a major insight of refs .",
    "was the concept of `` spontaneous interlayer coherence '' ( silc ) : at sufficiently small layer separations , electrons can spontaneously create and occupy linear combinations of layer states in which each layer has the same average number of electrons , _ even without any interlayer tunneling_. the spontaneous formation of superposed layer states in double - layer quantum hall ( 2lqh ) sytems can be accomplished by the interlayer exchange interaction alone .",
    "silc in balanced 2lqh systems corresponds to @xmath0 pseudospin ferromagnetism in which the pseudospins spontaneously magnetize , but do not point either up or down , since neither layer has ( on average ) more particles than the other.@xcite    the application of silc to the zero magnetic field case was first made by zheng and co - workers,@xcite who considered the same model system as ruden and wu@xcite  electrostatically balanced zero - thickness layers of interacting electrons without interlayer tunneling  but came to a very different conclusion .",
    "they proved within the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) that ( 1 ) the 2les becomes spin ferromagnetic before it becomes pseudospin ferromagnetic for any finite layer separation ( this possibility was not considered by ruden and wu ) , and ( 2 ) at low enough densities and small enough layer separations , the pseudospin ferromagnetic state possesses silc , with all electrons occupying one subband composed of a superposition of layer states with equal average density in each layer .",
    "conti and senatore have also argued that for electrostatically balanced layers , the 2les ground state can not be one in which all electrons are eigenstates of the same single layer@xcite .",
    "silc at sufficiently small layer separations should also follow from earlier calculations presented in ref .",
    ", although no explicit inference of silc was made in that work .",
    "recent work that goes beyond the hfa and includes correlation effects within the stls approximation@xcite also finds that silc is favored over single - layer occupancy for balanced layers that are sufficiently close together.@xcite    when studying a 2les using a density - functional approach , it is important to note that silc is a nonlocal effect .",
    "calculations based on local - density approximations will not find silc if they treat the pseudospin as an ising - like variable.@xcite the same caveat applies to the work of ruden and wu , who used a restricted hfa that excluded the possibility of silc .",
    "once the intralayer separation between electrons becomes comparable to the interlayer separation between layers , the possibility of interlayer correlations ( such as silc ) must be considered .",
    "the spontaneous charge - transfer state predicted by ruden and wu follows quite generally ( even beyond the hfa ) from the fact that when interlayer correlations are ignored , the negative compressibility of the electron gas guarantees an interlayer charge - transfer instability at sufficiently small layer spacing .",
    "but it is precisely at small layer spacings that interlayer correlations become important , and so their effects must be included to obtain physically meaningful results .",
    "we have extended the study the effects of coulombic exchange in double - layer electron and hole systems to include an applied bias due to front and back gate voltages , while allowing for the possibility interlayer exchange . in the balanced case",
    ", we have found that the four- to two - component transition is always interrupted by the presence of a three - component phase with slightly unequal layer densities .",
    "there are therefore four possible noncrystalline phases for a 2les with balanced gates . under bias or tunneling a second ( pseudospin - polarized ) two - component state is also possible .",
    "we have enumerated the transitions between the five allowed states in the presence of bias , and explored the effects of bias on the one - component state .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "we treat the quantum wells as zero - thickness layers sandwiched between two plates of neutralizing charge , which represent the effects of the front and back gates .",

    "it is also assumed that small changes @xmath10 in the gate voltages @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) produce small changes in surface charge densities only at the gates ( @xmath13 ) and in the layers ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "overall charge neutrality requires that the total charge density vanish : @xmath16 ( strictly speaking , we only require that the _ change _ in the total charge density vanish : @xmath17 . ) in writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : elecneut ] ) , we have assumed that any stray charge not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elecneut ] ) is unchanged when the gate voltage are varied .",
    "this implies that the only significant effect of the stray charges is to shift the gate voltages by constant ( empirically determined ) amounts .",

    "regarding the gate charge densities @xmath21 as fixed quantities , we seek the values of the particle density in the inner layers that minimize the total energy per unit area @xmath22 . following ref .",

    "the quantity @xmath24 represents the total energy per unit area for a fully interacting double - layer system in which each layer contains a uniform neutralizing charge density , for particle densities @xmath25 and @xmath26 in layers 1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "however , most experiments fix the back - gate voltage @xmath9 rather than the total density , and sweep the front - gate voltage @xmath8 . because of the relatively large size of the back - gate distance @xmath2 , the constraint of fixed back - gate voltage ( @xmath60 ) is very nearly equivalent to that of fixed back - gate sheet charge density ( @xmath61 or , by gauss s law , @xmath62 ) . for @xmath62 ,",

    "the difficulty in measuring @xmath45 is that ( at least one of ) layers 1 and 2 must be separately contactable , which becomes increasingly difficult as the layer separation @xmath3 becomes very small .",
    "nonetheless , measurements of the eisenstein ratio have been used to demonstrate the negative compressibility of the electron gas,@xcite and it is to be expected that devices with separately contactable layers will be built with increasingly narrow layer separations .",

    "( [ eq : stability ] ) , the condition for the onset of an instability to interlayer charge transfer , , shows that @xmath45 formally diverges at the instability .",
    "this can also be seen from the relation @xmath67 , since a charge transfer instability would produce an abrupt change in the layer density @xmath25 in response to a small change in the gate density @xmath27 .",
    "although evidence for abrupt interlayer charge transfers has been reported based on shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) measurements,@xcite the eisenstein ratio would be a far more sensitive measure of abrupt interlayer charge transfers .",
    "in subsequent sections , we calculate the layer densities @xmath48 as a function of the front - gate particle density @xmath27 , for fixed back - gate particle density @xmath28 . fortunately , @xmath28 may be found experimentally from sdh measurements as the value of the layer densities when the system is balanced : i.e. , for equal layer densities ( @xmath68 ) and minimum subband separation . once @xmath28 ( which we assume is very nearly constant ) is known , @xmath27 may be determined from charge conservation by measuring the total layer density , either by sdh ( as the sum of the subband densities ) or by hall effect measurements .",

    "disorder imposes further constraints , because it limits the maximum @xmath222 for which the particles are still mobile .",

    "another way of saying this is that the large magnetic field experienced in each @xmath600 layer quenches the kinetic energy of the particles , and that this quenching might strongly enhance exchange instabilities  in this case towards pseudospin polarization ( @xmath189 ) , presumably with @xmath602 ( when @xmath147 ) , since no spontaneous interlayer transfer has been found to occur for @xmath284 .",
    "one appealing feature of a hypothetical @xmath236 cf state is that it would have small or zero resistivity in the pseudospin channel ( i.e. , for oppositely directed currents ) , the same channel in which the 2lqh state exhibits superfluidity at sufficiently small layer separations.@xcite such a @xmath236 state of cf s would exhibit silc ( @xmath507 even when @xmath151 ) and therefore possess zero - temperature coulomb drag .",

    "it has recently been found that double - layer systems in strong magnetic fields near total filling factor unity exhibit a huge resonant enhancement of the interlayer tunneling conductivity when silc is present.@xcite it would be interesting to measure the tunneling conductivity for a tilted sample , since many - body effects in a state with silc strongly suppress the interlayer tunneling amplitude when the parallel component of the magnetic field exceeds a critical value .",
