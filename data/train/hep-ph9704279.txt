    "it was noted many years ago that the form of the @xmath8-meson peak is distorted by the interference between resonant and non - resonant @xmath0 production . for the case of `` elastic '' @xmath1 photoproduction",
    "the effect was studied by p.sding in @xcite and s.drell @xcite ( who considered the possibility to produce the pion    beam via the @xmath9 process ) . at high energies",
    "the main ( and the only ) source of background is the drell - hiida - deck process @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the incoming photon fluctuates into the pion pair and then @xmath10-elastic scattering takes place .",
    "thus the amplitude for the background may be written in terms of the pion - proton cross section .",
    "recently the difractive elastic production of @xmath1-mesons was measured at hera @xcite both for the cases of photoproduction i.e. @xmath11 and of @xmath12 gev@xmath13 ( the so called deep inelastic scattering , dis , regime ) .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the interference with some non - resonant background is indeed needed to describe the distribution over the mass - @xmath14 of @xmath0 pair .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of calculation of @xmath15 with correction the numerical error published in fig.6 of @xcite . in sect .",
    "2 the formulae for the @xmath5 background which are valid for the dis region are presented .",
    "the expression differs slightly from the sding s one as we take into account the pion form factor and the fact that one pion propagator is off - mass shell .",
    "we consider also the absorbtion correction comming from the diagram where both pions ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) directly interact with the target proton . in sect .",
    "3 we compute the ratio @xmath15 for a pion pair production in dis . at large @xmath18 gev@xmath13",
    "the background amplitude becomes relatively small , but still not negligible .",
    "it changes the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse @xmath8-meson production cross section and leads to the decreasing of @xmath15 value with @xmath19 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath1 photo- and electroproduction may be written as : @xmath20 are the resonant and non - resonant parts of the production amplitude , @xmath21 for longitudinal and transverse photons , @xmath22 -*q*@xmath23 is the momentum transfered to the proton and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the azimutal and polar angles between the @xmath16 and the proton direction in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
    "the dynamics of vector meson photo- and electroproduction was discussed in the framework of qcd in many papers ( see , e.g. [ 9 - 12 ] ) . however here",
    "we will use the simple phenomenological parametrization of the production amplitude because our main aim is the discussion of the interference between resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "so the amplitude for resonant process @xmath27 ; @xmath28 reads : @xmath29 to take into account the phase space available for the @xmath30 decay we use the width @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev  its mass ) ; @xmath34 is the @xmath35-slope of the `` elastic '' @xmath8 production cross section @xmath36 ( at @xmath37 ) and the functions @xmath38 describe the angular distribution of the pions produced through the @xmath8-meson decay : @xmath39 @xmath40 note that for transverse photons with polarization vector @xmath41 one has to replace the last factor @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) by the scalar product @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the unit vector in the pion transverse momentum direction .",
    "the amplitude for the non - resonant process @xmath45 is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath35-slope of the elastic @xmath10 cross section , @xmath48 is the pion electromagnetic form factor ( @xmath49 is the virtuality of the incoming photon ) , @xmath50 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath51  the photon momentum fraction carried by the @xmath17 -meson ; @xmath52 is the total pion - proton cross section .",
    "the factor @xmath53 is equal to @xmath54 for longitudinal photons the products @xmath55 are : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , while for the transverse photons we may put ( after averaging ) @xmath58 .",
    "expressions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are the result of straitforward calculation of the feynman diagram fig .",
    "the first term in ( 6 ) comes from the graph fig . 1 ( in which the pomeron couples to the @xmath16 ) and the second one reflects the contribution originated by the @xmath59 interaction .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath17 electric charge leads to the minus sign of the second term .",
    "we omit here the phases of the amplitudes .",
    "in fact , the common phase is inessential for the cross section , and we assume that the relative phase between @xmath60 and @xmath61 is small ( equal to zero ) as in both cases the phase is generated by the same pomeron exchange .",
    "the form factor @xmath62 is written to account for the virtuality ( @xmath63 ) of the t - channel ( vertical in fig .",
    "1 ) pion . as in fig .",
    "1 we do not deal with pure elastic pion - proton scattering , the amplitude may be slightly suppressed by the fact that the incoming pion is off - mass shell . to estimate this suppression we include the form factor ( chosen in the pole form ) @xmath64 the same pole form was used for @xmath65 . in the last case",
    "the parameter @xmath66 is the mass of the @xmath8-meson  the first resonance on the @xmath8-meson ( i.e. photon ) regge trajectory , but the value of @xmath67 ( in @xmath62 ) is expected to be larger .",
    "it should be of the order of mass of the next resonance from the regge @xmath68-meson trajectory ; i.e. it should be the mass of @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "thus we put @xmath71 gev@xmath13 .",
    "finaly we have to define @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 in these notations @xmath76 and @xmath77 with the pion transverse ( with respect to the proton direction ) momentum @xmath78 ( in the @xmath5 rest frame ) given by expression @xmath79 .",
    "note that the positive values of @xmath80 correspond to @xmath81 while the negative ones @xmath82 correspond to @xmath83 .      to account for the screening correction we have to consider the diagram fig .",
    "2 , where both pions interact directly with the target . note that all the rescatterings of one pion ( say @xmath16 in fig",
    ". 1 ) are already included into the @xmath10 elastic amplitude .",
    "the result may be written in form of eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the new factor @xmath84 instead of the old one @xmath85 : @xmath86 where the second term is the absorptive correction ( fig .",
    "2 ) and @xmath87 is the momentum transfered along the pomeron loop .",
    "the factor @xmath88 reflects the contribution of the enhacement graphs with the diffractive exitation of the target proton in intermediate state . in accordance with the hera data @xcite , where the cross section of `` inelastic '' ( i.e. with the proton diffracted ) @xmath8 photoproduction was estimated as @xmath89 we choose @xmath90 .",
    "at very large @xmath2 the background amplitude ( 5 ) becomes negligible as , even without the additional form factor ( i.e. at @xmath91 ) , the non - resonance cross section falls down as @xmath92 , one factor @xmath93 comes from the electromagnetic form factor @xmath94 and another one  from the pion propagator ( term - @xmath95 in the denominator of @xmath53 ( see eq.(6 ) ) . ] while experimentally @xcite the @xmath2 behaviour of the elastic @xmath8 cross sections has been found to be @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .",
    "nevertheless , numerically at @xmath98 the background as well as interference contributions are still important .",
    "the background as well as interference contributions lead to the nontrivial behaviour of the ratio @xmath15 with the two pion mass @xmath99 . in the theoretical formulae which we used the index @xmath100 denotes the polarization of the incoming photon . on the other hand experimentally one measures the @xmath8-meson polarization , fitting the angular distribution of decay pions . to reproduce the procedure",
    "we take the flows of initial longitudinal and transverse photons to be equal to each other ( @xmath101 , which is close to hera case ) and reanalyse the sum of cross sections ( @xmath102 ) in a usual way , selecting the constant and the @xmath103 parts .",
    "@xmath104 in these terms the density matrix element @xmath105 and @xmath106 namely these last ratios ( 12 ) are presented in fig . 3 for different @xmath2 values . presented in fig .",
    "6 of our previous paper @xcite were wrong due to a misprint in the code .",
    "] we have to recall , that the ratio @xmath107 given by the last expression of eq .",
    "( 12 ) strictly speaking is not identical to the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse photon cross sections @xmath4 . due to the form factor @xmath62 the background pion angular distribution ( corresponding to the non - resonant amplitude ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) ) are more complicated than the trivial @xmath108 ( for @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 ) .",
    "for example , even in the case of the transverse photon polarization vector ( i.e. @xmath109 ) at very large @xmath2 the non - resonant contribution @xmath112 reveals the peaks in the forward and backward ( @xmath113 ) directions instead of a pure @xmath114 behaviour . that is why in fig .",
    "3 we present not the theoretical @xmath4 ratio , but the values of @xmath115 which are more close to the ratios measured experimentally .",
    "one can see that they depend both on @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that for the resonant amplitude @xmath60 in fig .",
    "3 we have fixed @xmath116 independently on the mass @xmath14 and @xmath2 . on the other hand for the non - resonant production ( @xmath112 ) , neglecting for simplicity the form factor ( i.e. @xmath117 ) and the absorptive corrections , one has @xmath118 .    at large @xmath119 10 gev@xmath13 it gives @xmath120 .",
    "at last we have to take into account the interference , which is positive ( constructive ) at small @xmath121 and destructive at @xmath122 .",
    "thus the final curves 3 and 4 fall down with @xmath14 giving @xmath123 at @xmath124 gev and @xmath125 at @xmath126 gev .",
    "of course at very large @xmath2 the background amplitude dies out but simultaneously the value of @xmath127 increases with @xmath2 . therefore the curves 3 and 4 ( which correspondent to @xmath2 = 10 gev@xmath13 and 30 gev@xmath13 ) are rather close to each other .    in the region of not too large @xmath128 gev@xmath13",
    "the non - resonant amplitude is compartible with the resonant one at @xmath129 gev . in particular , for @xmath130 gev@xmath13 ( curve 1 ) the destructive interference at @xmath131 gev cancel the main part of the transverse cross section , leading to a very large value of @xmath107 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this effect depends on the @xmath2 value .",
    "say , the maximum of the peak of @xmath107 is at @xmath133 0.03 gev@xmath13 for @xmath14 = 1.15 gev and at @xmath133 0.3 gev@xmath13 for @xmath14 = 1.25 gev",
    ". however one must not take the presented predictions in fig .",
    "3 too seriously for large @xmath14 .",
    "the interference with the next ( heavier ) resonances ( say , @xmath134 ) was not taken into account in fig . 3 but at @xmath135 gev their contribution can be significant that can change the results .",
    "we presented the results of @xmath15 ratio calculations for @xmath8-meson electroproduction with accounting for the background to elastic mechanism .",
    "the role of @xmath8-meson  background interference decreases with @xmath2 however it is not negligible even at @xmath136 gev@xmath13 .            fig .",
