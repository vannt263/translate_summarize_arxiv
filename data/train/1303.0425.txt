    "it is a well - known fact that by far the most applied control law for siso systems in nearly all industries ( process control , motion control , aerospace etc ) is the pid control .",
    "no other controller can compete to pid when it comes to performance per simplicity of the control structure , this being the reason for its absolute dominance in the practice .",
    "traditionally , tuning of a pid controller has been the overwhelming usability approach in research and applications .",
    "the design technique presented here is in some sense an opposing one .",
    "we want to compute the total set of pid - stabilizers . while it turns out to be interesting in theoretical terms , its impact on practical applications is difficult to predict .",
    "advanced software tools based on this technology ( e.g. robsin , @xcite ) suggest to the user a 3d - region in ( @xmath0)-parameter space , where he can select a controller from . by doing so",
    ", he would additionally have an idea how robust ( i.e. how far from instability ) his design is .",
    "a further good news is that the same technique applies for time - delay systems and in discrete - time domain .",
    "this paper covers theoretical design issues only .",
    "it has been shown that the stabilizing region for continuous - time pid ( @xmath1 ) controllers is defined by a set of convex polygonal slices normal to @xmath2 axis in the @xmath3 parameter space , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the method followed by the author uses the decoupling effect of pid parameter space at singular frequencies , @xcite . thereby the characteristic polynomial decouples into two frequency parameterized equations , one involving @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and another one with @xmath2 only . as a consequence",
    ", the computation of all stable pid controllers may be divided into two subproblems : assertion of stable intervals of parameter @xmath2 ( so - called @xmath2-problem ) , and detection of stable polygons on the plane ( @xmath6 ) for a given @xmath2 . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the design approach was transferred to discrete - time systems , and in @xcite to time - delay systems .",
    "a general algorithm for automatic detection of stable polygons is based on the analysis of the motion of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the singular frequencies .",
    "this algorithm was first presented in @xcite .",
    "it detects the inner polygons and selects the one with maximal stable eigenvalues , which is finally checked for stability .",
    "it is important to emphasize , that this algorithm can be applied equally well for pid quasi - polynomials describing the pid control loops for time - delay systems .",
    "preserving simplicity has been a basic motivation in searching for a solution to the @xmath2-problem .",
    "a simple necessary condition was firstly understood in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for a given plant a sufficient number of singular frequencies must be available for its stabilization .",
    "since @xmath2 uniquely determines the number of singular frequencies , one can directly read @xmath2-intervals from the @xmath2-plot , which may host stable polygons .",
    "this simple criterion can be extended to discrete - time domain and time - delay quasi - polynomials , for instance , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the presented methods may be directly applied for the computation of the total robust set of pid controllers which stabilize a finite set of plants ( multi - model ) .",
    "this is exactly what is meant by robust design of pid controllers .    in this paper methods for pid control in continuous- and discrete - time domain , as well as for time - delay systems , are reviewed .",
    "therefore , we will have to switch between the @xmath7 domain ( continuous - time ) and @xmath8-domain ( discrete - time ) while presenting results .",

    "section  [ sec : verybasicidea ] presents all steps of the design process , and simultaneously introduces the formulates technical problems , in a simple - case study .",
    "theoretical fundamentals of the methods are introduced in section  [ sec : basicdefinitions ] .",
    "automatic detection of convex stable polygons and @xmath9-problems are discussed in section  [ sec : stablepolygons ] and [ sec : kp - porblem ] , respectively .",

    "the role of convex polygons was firstly understood by battacharyya and his co - workers , see the monograph @xcite .",

    "munro s computation is based on the real - axis intersections of the nyquist plot , see , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relationship to singular frequencies was noticed firstly by ackermann and kaesbauer , see @xcite .",
    "soylemez proposed a solution to the @xmath2-problem , however in author s opinion his criterion is not as simple and usable as the one presented in this article . the remainder theory reviewed here",
    "is fairly developed by the author , including the algorithms for automatic detection of stable polygons and solutions to the @xmath2-problem , as well as generalizations to discrete - time domain and time - delay systems .",
