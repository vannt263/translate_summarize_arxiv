    "the advance in the ability to analyze strong coupling effects in supersymmetric field theories @xcite led to a verification of some qualitative ideas about the behavior of gauge field theories .",
    "in particular , confinement in @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) was shown @xcite to be related , as expected , to monopole condensation . in a confining phase , the electric field",
    "is confined to flux tubes  strings  carrying a definite energy density ( string tension ) .",
    "electrically charged sources are connected by such strings and this leads to a confining force between them , , a force that does not vanish as the distance between them is increased .",
    "an explicit demonstration of such a situation , for @xmath0 sym theory was suggested recently , in the framework of a realization of gauge theories in m theory on @xmath4 , which is dual to type iia string theory .",
    "the 4d gauge theory is realized as the dimensionally reduced low energy effective field theory on an m5 brane wrapped on a riemann surface . when all the characteristic distances , including the radius of @xmath5 , are large with respect to the planck length , the semi - classical approximation is used @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the effective gauge theory is identified when the radius @xmath6 of @xmath5 is vanishingly small , corresponding to perturbative type iia string theory . as explained in @xcite , a change in @xmath6 has , in general , an effect on the world - volume field theory , so the results that one obtains for large @xmath6 are for a theory which can be different from the gauge theory one attempts to study .",
    "however , there are indications that these theories are in the same universality class and , therefore , have the same qualitative properties",
    ". a weaker expectation would be that qualitative confining features , will be shared by these theories .",
    "it is those features which we wish to study in this paper .",
    "a candidate for flux tubes in @xmath0 sym theory was suggested in @xcite : an m2 brane with one spatial dimension extended in a physical direction and the other in an internal direction , extending between points on the m5 brane .",
    "this is called _ an mqcd string _ ; it was explored further in @xcite .",
    "considering the realization of @xmath0 sqcd ",
    "supersymmetric @xmath7 gauge theory with fundamental quarks ",
    "the quark states were also identified as m2 branes ending on the m5 brane , these with their full extension in internal space , and it was shown that when confinement is expected , these quarks can not exist in isolation and must be either grouped in multiples of @xmath8 , forming baryons , or connected to mqcd strings , forming mesons . moreover , for the @xmath9 model , weakly broken to @xmath0 by a mass for the adjoint , the authors of @xcite identified @xmath10 types of strings with different tensions and reproduced the field theoretical results of @xcite .    the string connecting two oppositely charged sources , carries flux which is determined by the sources . in the absence of dynamical matter , this flux protects the string from breaking , by charge conservation .",
    "however , when there is dynamical matter carrying an appropriate charge , a pair may be created from the vacuum , cutting the string in two . physically , this means that the potentially confining force between the external sources is screened by the dynamical matter . because of this screening , the string itself is expected to be charged only under those elements of the gauge group that act _ trivially _ on the dynamical fields . in particular , when there are no such group elements , one does not expect stable strings . instead , the force between any external sources is expected to vanish as the distance between them increases .",
    "this leads to a distinction between two physically different possibilities , depending on the algebraic structure of the matter sector . when the dynamical matter can screen any external charge , , when there are no group elements acting trivially on the dynamical fields , the forces felt by these charges are qualitatively the same as in the higgs phase and",
    "there is no actual phase boundary between the higgs and confining phases ; the corresponding branches are smoothly connected @xcite . on the other hand , when there are external charges that can not be screened by the dynamical matter , the force between them is qualitatively different in the higgs and confining branches and , therefore , these branches are expected to be separated by a boundary .",
    "to determine which of these possibilities is realized , one should find the subgroup @xmath11 of the gauge group that acts trivially on the dynamical fields .",
    "confinement and higgs phases are expected to be distinct iff @xmath11 is non - trivial . a realization of the subgroup @xmath11 was suggested in @xcite . considering @xmath0 sym theory ,",
    "@xmath11 was identified as the homology group of the mqcd string and this group was , indeed , shown to be isomorphic to @xmath12 . in this work we elaborate on the geometric manifestation of the kinematic algebraic screening considerations , implied by the above identification of @xmath11 : the confining phase should be distinct from the higgs phase , when the later exists , iff there is a stable mqcd string , carrying a non - trivial @xmath11 charge .    to investigate confinement and screening , it is useful to realize the external probes as dynamical , but very heavy , particles , as is done , for example , in @xcite . at energies small compared to the mass of the probes ,",
    "when the string connecting them is not too long , it is energetically protected from being cut by a pair of the massive particles .",
    "therefore , such a string probes the model without the heavy particles : if in this model confinement and higgs phases are distinct , this will be manifested by the stability of the string .",
    "when the string is long enough , it should become unstable .    in the present work we use m theory to study confinement and screening for systems with various local and global symmetries .",
    "we identify the mqcd string , find its conserved charge  the homology group  and compare to the field - theoretical expectation  the subgroup @xmath11 .",
    "we then introduce external quarks and demonstrate confinement , when they are heavy and screening , when they are light .",
    "all our results are in agreement with the field theoretical analysis .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section [ sec - su ]",
    "we consider @xmath7 models .",
    "we start with @xmath0 sqcd , the model considered in @xcite , as the simplest example , to explain the relevant concepts and methods .",
    "we then add an adjoint matter field with a polynomial superpotential .",
    "section [ sec - lsu ] is devoted to models with products of @xmath7 gauge factors and section [ sec - o4 ] , to models with @xmath13 and @xmath14 gauge groups .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 models are realized here by configurations that include an orientifold 4-plane , and we find ourselves on an unpaved way as far as brane dynamics is involved .",
    "guided by field theoretical expectations , we suggest some rules for m2 brane configurations in the presence of the orientifold .",
    "these rules are then used to obtain predictions for the confining behavior of all the @xmath15 and @xmath16 models considered .",
    "we end in section [ sec - disc ] with a summary and concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    "we prove some properties of m2 branes used in section [ sec - o4 ] .",
    "in this section we consider models with @xmath7 gauge group . we start with a brief review of the brane realization and then analyze the @xmath0 sym model .",
    "we use this model to introduce and explain the concepts and methods that are used in the other parts of this work . in subsection",
    "[ sec - screen ] , we show that the dynamical fundamental quarks screen the confining force and in subsection [ sec - adj ] , we add an adjoint matter field with a polynomial superpotential .",
    "we start with the brane configuration in weakly coupled type iia string theory .",
    "it is illustrated in figure [ f - cfg ] .",
    "all branes are extended in the @xmath17 directions , and are at a fixed value of @xmath18 , so these directions are suppressed .",
    "there are two ns5 branes at fixed values of @xmath19 while the d4 branes are extended in this direction .",
    "@xmath8 of them are suspended between the two ns5 branes and @xmath20 additional d4 branes end on the right ns5 brane and extend directions . in the description used here , these d6 branes are taken very far away in the @xmath19 direction . ] to @xmath21 .    when the ns5 branes are parallel ( , extend in the @xmath22 direction ; see figure [ f - cfg]a ) , the low energy effective field theory on the world - volume of the _ finite _ d4 branes , , those with a finite extent in the @xmath19 direction , is an @xmath9 4d @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath20 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "the vector multiplets , in the adjoint representation , originate from strings between the finite d4 branes , while the hypermultiplets originate from strings between a semi - infinite d4 brane and a finite one .",
    "the finite d4 branes are free to move in the @xmath23 direction , with the ` center of mass ' frozen by a non - perturbative effect @xcite , and this motion realizes the coulomb branch of the field theory : the @xmath23 locations of these branes are identified with the eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar s vev .    a rotation of one of the ns5 branes in the @xmath24 space , where @xmath25 , corresponds to a mass for the adjoint scalar , which lifts the coulomb branch .",
    "indeed , such a rotation restricts the finite d4 branes to the unique ( @xmath24 ) point shared by both ns5 branes .",
    "generically , such a rotation will break all remaining supersymmetry , but there are rotations that preserve half of the remaining supersymmetry @xcite , corresponding to an @xmath0 supersymmetric mass term for the adjoint hypermultiplet @xcite . in particular , when the right ns5 brane is extended in the @xmath26 direction ( see figure [ f - cfg]b ) , the adjoint scalar and its spinor superpartner decouple  get infinite mass  and one obtains @xcite @xmath0 sqcd .",
    "as already noted , the above description is in the framework of weakly coupled type iia string theory , which is a limit of m theory compactified on @xmath4 , with vanishingly small radius @xmath6 of the circle @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 is finite , the above brane configuration turns into a single m5 brane @xcite and for large @xmath6 , compared to the 11d planck scale , one uses m theory .",
    "the m5 brane is of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the @xmath17 directions and @xmath29 is a two dimensional surface embedded in the internal space @xmath30 , parameterized by the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath31 .    in the @xmath9 configuration @xcite , the ns5 branes contribute to @xmath29 two surfaces in the @xmath23 direction and each d4 brane contributes a tube , wrapping once the @xmath32 direction ( degenerating to a line in the @xmath33 limit ) .",
    "the resulting curve is the seiberg - witten curve @xcite , encoding the low energy effective gauge coupling .",
    "the various bps states are realized as minimal membranes  m2 branes  with their full extension in @xmath30 , , point - like in @xmath34 , and having boundaries on the m5 brane . when the ns5 branes are not parallel , as in figure [ f - cfg]b , the finite d4 branes merge and form a single tube wrapping the compact dimension @xmath8 times .",
    "for the configuration described in figure [ f - cfg]b , when the ns5 branes are orthogonal to each other , @xmath29 assumes the following form @xcite : t = v^-n(m - v)/m vw=:=[^bm]^ . here",
    "@xmath35 ( @xmath36 being a dimension - full constant ) , @xmath37 is the instanton factor , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "geometrically , the eigenvalues of @xmath39 are the @xmath23-locations of the semi - infinite d4 branes .",
    "the curve ( [ sg - su ] ) is only valid for @xmath40 , but we indeed consider only massive quarks .      in @xmath0 sym theory ( @xmath41 ) , all the dynamical fields are in the adjoint representation .",
    "the kernel @xmath11 of this representation ( .",
    "the set of group elements acting trivially ) is the center @xmath42 , so one expects the existence of strings ( flux tubes ) with a conserved @xmath42 charge .",
    "this means that a single string ( with unit charge ) should be stable ( protected by its charge ) , but @xmath8 parallel strings should be able to annihilate .",
    "a realization of such a string , called mqcd string , was studied in @xcite .",
    "it is an m2 brane with its boundary on the m5 brane . in its simplest form , its world - volume is of the form @xmath43 , where the factor @xmath44 is a string in the physical spacetime @xmath28 and @xmath45 is a curve in the internal space @xmath30 , extending between points on @xmath29 .",
    "its @xmath42 charge was identified with the homological classification of such surfaces . in the following we recall this analysis , relying on a pictorial approach , which will be useful in the later derivations .",
    "the relevance of the homological classification to conserved charges can be motivated as follows : the homological equivalence of two brane configurations means that there is a world - manifold that can be interpreted as describing an evolution between them , so a property which is the same for equivalent configurations will be conserved under such an evolutions .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f - toy ] ,    describing the evolution of a string in @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "when one considers a closed @xmath47-brane ( with no boundary ) , the above reasoning leads to the usual homology group @xmath48 : _ two @xmath47-branes - brane ' , possibly disconnected and/or ` wrapped ' a few times . ]",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 ( in the space @xmath30 ) are equivalent if the difference @xmath51 is a boundary of a @xmath52-brane .",
    "_ for example , figure [ f - toy](a ) describes the evolution of a closed string from the initial configuration @xmath49 ( consisting of a single string ) to the final one @xmath50 ( consisting of two strings ) and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are homologically equivalent . to see what this equivalence means ,",
    "assume that the space @xmath30 in which the string evolves is a punctured plane : the line @xmath53 in figure [ f - toy ] describes the world - line of the excluded point .",
    "a closed string has a conserved winding number around this point ( which is an element of @xmath54 ) and @xmath49 and @xmath50 have _ the same _ winding number , the winding number is conserved .    when the @xmath47 brane is allowed to end on some manifold @xmath29 ,",
    "the boundary of its world - manifold @xmath55 can be more complicated , as illustrated in figure [ f - toy]b : in addition to the initial and final configurations ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) there may be another part @xmath56 which describes the evolution of the @xmath47-brane s boundary .",
    "this part is constrained to be on is restricted to the _ world - manifold _ of @xmath29 , however , assuming @xmath29 is static , this world - manifold is @xmath57 and the @xmath58 factor is trivial topologically . ]",
    "@xmath29 , so one is led to the _ relative homology group _ , denoted by @xmath59 : _ two @xmath47-branes @xmath49 , @xmath50 are equivalent if the difference @xmath51 is either a boundary or can be complemented by another @xmath47-brane @xmath56 , which lies in @xmath29 , to form a boundary . _",
    "the significance of this change in classification is demonstrated in figure [ f - toy]b : the string is allowed to end on a circular d1-brane @xmath29 , which surrounds the excluded point . as a result ,",
    "the winding number is no longer conserved ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 in figure [ f - toy]b have _ different _ winding number ) .",
    "this is expressed mathematically by the fact that the relative homology group @xmath60 is trivial in this case .",
    "one can see clearly that this lack of conservation is closely related to the fact that @xmath29 itself carries a non - trivial winding number .",
    "we return now to our specific case : the mqcd string .",
    "it is an m2 brane which looks in the physical space as a string , extending between external charges at infinity . in its simplest form , it has the structure @xmath61 , where the factor @xmath58 represents the coordinate @xmath62 along the string and @xmath45 is a curve in the internal space @xmath30 .",
    "more generally , @xmath63 can depend on @xmath62 .",
    "we look for a conserved property of this string that can be identified with the flux of the flux tube that this string represents , so ( 1 ) this should be a property of the _ cross - section _",
    "@xmath64 of the string , which is independent of @xmath62 and ( 2 ) it should governs the stability of the string .",
    "the homological classification of the cross - section obeys both these requirements : ( 1 ) different cross - section are , by definition , homologically equivalent and ( 2 ) to break the string , the cross - section must be deformed to a point , which is possible iff the cross - section is trivial homologically .",
    "therefore , one is led to identify the charge group @xmath12 of the flux tube with the homology group @xmath60 .    to show ( following @xcite ) that @xmath60 is indeed isomorphic to @xmath42 , we first state a general result concerning @xmath60 , which is true whenever @xmath29 is connected ( as will be the case in all the models we will consider ) .",
    "* to investigate @xmath60 , it is enough to consider _ closed curves _ , since an open curve @xmath45 ( ending on @xmath29 ) can be complemented to a closed one by a curve in @xmath29 connecting the endpoints of @xmath45 .",
    "* to obtain @xmath60 , one can start from @xmath65 and find the elements ( equivalence classes ) that contain ( closed ) curves in @xmath29 .",
    "these elements form a subgroup @xmath66 of @xmath65 .",
    "the curves in @xmath66 are exactly the curves which are trivial in @xmath60 , therefore , h_1(/)h_1()/k .",
    "this result can be derived @xcite using the exact sequence @xmath67    now we turn to the specific form of @xmath30 and @xmath29 and apply eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) . recall that @xmath30 is of the form @xmath68 , where @xmath5 is the 10th ( compact ) spatial dimension .",
    "@xmath30 is parameterized by @xmath24 , and @xmath69 , so arg(@xmath70 ) parameterizes the compact dimension and the point @xmath71 ( corresponding to @xmath72 ) is excluded .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 , its elements being the winding numbers around @xmath71 .",
    "the embedding of @xmath29 in @xmath30 is given by t = v^-n vw= , so @xmath29 can be identified with the punctured @xmath23 plane ( with the origin deleted ) . therefore , closed curves in @xmath29 are classified by their winding number around @xmath73 and from the relation @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ sg - su0 ] ) we learn that each loop around @xmath73 is accompanied by @xmath8 loops around @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the group @xmath66 of elements in @xmath65 , which are trivial in @xmath60 are the multiples of @xmath8 so , using eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "to summarize , the mqcd string is an m2 brane which is represented in the internal space @xmath30 by a curve @xmath45 , extending between points in @xmath29 .",
    "as such , it has a ( topological ) @xmath42 charge , that is identified with the center of the gauge group . to determine the charge of a given string @xmath45 one should ` close ' it by a curve in @xmath29 and find the winding number of the resulting curve around @xmath71 .",
    "such a string is described in figure [ f - sus ] .",
    "this is a projection on the @xmath23 plane .",
    "each point in the figure corresponds to a unique point on @xmath29 but we want to consider also points in @xmath30 which are _ not _ on @xmath29 . to distinguish between them we use dashed lines for curves on @xmath29 and full lines for curves not on @xmath29 .",
    "the circle is on @xmath29 and corresponds to @xmath76const . ,",
    "which implies @xmath77const .. the emphasized points have also common @xmath32 and there are @xmath8 such points .",
    "now we connect two adjacent points @xmath78 by a curve @xmath45 with _",
    "constant @xmath70 _ ( which is , therefore , not in @xmath29 ) . to find its charge , we close it by adding to it the arc @xmath56 above it ( which is in @xmath29 ) .",
    "the resulting loop winds once around @xmath32 , so @xmath45 has unit charge .",
    "note that we could close @xmath45 from below , obtaining the charge @xmath79 , so the charge is indeed defined only modulo @xmath8 .",
    "the loop @xmath80 can be moved off @xmath29 ( having no boundary ) , and then there is no obstruction from shrinking it to a point in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "however , it can not disappear , since it still winds around @xmath32 . instead",
    ", we have obtained a cylindrical m2 brane , winding around @xmath32 and such an m2 brane is identified as the fundamental closed string .",
    "this is a good place to make an important remark .",
    "the process we have described demonstrates that the mqcd string is equivalent _ topologically _ to a closed string .",
    "this means that there is a _ kinematical _ possibility that one will transform to the other , however , such a process may be highly suppressed by the dynamics . in particular , as explained in @xcite , to be able to investigate the mqcd string while ignoring stringy effects , we should be in a range of parameters where an mqcd string _ can not _",
    "transform to a closed string .",
    "this range of parameters was explored in @xcite . in this work",
    "we are mainly concerned with kinematics , as manifested by the topology of world - manifolds .",
    "so when we say that two curves are equivalent , it should be understood in this kinematical sense .",
    "as explained previously , the charge of the mqcd string protects it from breaking , so in the absence of @xmath42 charged particles ( quarks ) , it is infinite in physical space @xmath81 and is stable ( infinite in time ) .",
    "this is interpreted as a signal of confinement in the gauge theory . to investigate confinement further ,",
    "one introduces heavy fundamental matter ( quarks ) that , at this stage , is used to provide external probes of the gauge force @xcite .",
    "this is done , as described in the beginning of this section , by adding semi - infinite d4 branes  tubes of m5 brane in m theory .",
    "the large mass means that the d4 branes are very far ( in the @xmath23 direction ) from the finite d4 branes .",
    "this implies that they have negligible influence on the geometry of @xmath29 at this region and the analysis of the previous subsection continues to apply . in particular ,",
    "the mqcd string still exists and , at low enough energies ( at which it is restricted to be kept far from the semi - infinite d4 branes ) it has the same stability properties .    to identify the quarks ,",
    "one considers the @xmath9 model in the coulomb phase , where the unbroken gauge symmetry is abelian and the quarks are not confined .",
    "the corresponding bps states are identified with m2 branes with a boundary that surrounds ( in the @xmath23 plane ) one finite and one semi - infinite d4 brane ; in principle , it may be either a disk ( with one boundary ) or a cylinder ( with two boundaries , each winding one d4 brane ) .",
    "these two types of surfaces are illustrated in figure [ f - qrk ] .",
    "they are ` continuously ' connected , , they are homologically equivalent . in the following , we will refer only to the cylindrical topology , but we do not loose generality by this , since one can deform ` continuously ' ( in the above homological sense ) between the two topologies . in particular , the unique boundary loop @xmath82 of a disk can be seen as a limiting case of a two - loop boundary @xmath83 of a cylinder .",
    "the winding numbers of the boundary ( in the @xmath23 plane ) around the d4 branes represent the color and flavor quantum numbers of the quark ( the two possible orientations correspond to a quark and anti - quark ) .",
    "next one rotates the left ns5 brane . in field theory",
    ", this corresponds to a mass for the adjoint hypermultiplet . as a result ,",
    "monopoles condense and this is expected to trigger confinement of electric charge .",
    "this indeed can be seen in the brane configuration @xcite : upon rotation , all the @xmath8 finite tubes ( d4 branes ) join to a single tube , winding @xmath8 times around @xmath32 . as a result ,",
    "the m2 brane configurations described in figure [ f - qrk ] are not possible any more . to understand this , note that @xmath84 winds once around @xmath32 , so @xmath85 should also wind once , but there is no such loop ( with color quantum numbers ) .",
    "this is seen as a manifestation of confinement : there are no isolated quarks . to see what _ is _ possible",
    ", one may check what happens to @xmath85 , as the left ns5 brane is rotated .",
    "this is described ( for @xmath86 ) in figure [ f - cnf ] .",
    "this is a schematic and @xmath32 directions .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite . ]",
    "illustration of a cross - section of the m5 brane between the two ns5 branes .",
    "the shaded circles represent the d4 brane tubes .",
    "as the tubes join , @xmath85 is forced to have a part that _ is not _ on @xmath29 .",
    "since the m2 brane can not end there , it must connect to another piece of an m2 brane . comparing with figure [ f - sus ]",
    ", one can see that this other piece can be the mqcd string with a unit charge .",
    "indeed , the curve @xmath80 in figure [ f - sus ] winds once around @xmath32 , exactly as is required from @xmath85 . to summarize ,",
    "we have the following evidence for confinement in @xmath0 mqcd :    * in the absence of external quarks , the mqcd string is infinite and stable ; * m2 branes representing isolated quarks do not exist ; * there is an m2 brane representing a meson : quark and anti - quark with an mqcd string extending between them .      to investigate screening , we consider higher energy scales , which means that we allow more energetic excitations and , in particular , a longer string . in the m theoretic description",
    "it means that we allow m2 branes with a larger area , so the region of the semi - infinite d4 branes becomes accessible to the m2 brane .",
    "therefore , the stability of the mqcd string should be re - examined now , with the full curve ( [ sg - su ] ) replacing ( [ sg - su0 ] ) as @xmath29 . to use relation ( [ hr ] ) , all we have to do is to find which closed curves in @xmath30 are equivalent ( in @xmath65 ) to curves in @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is unchanged by adding quarks ( only the m5 brane is modified ) , thus @xmath65 is still generated by a loop around the compact direction .",
    "the semi - infinite d4 brane which represents a quark winds _ once _ around the compact dimension , as can be easily verified simply connected , leading to the same result for @xmath60 . ] , therefore , _ all _ closed curves are equivalent to curves in @xmath29 , so @xmath60 is the trivial group .",
    "this means that in this case @xmath29 leaves no residual conserved charge from the winding number in @xmath30 and the mqcd string is not protected anymore by topological considerations  it can break .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the semi - infinite d4 brane should be involved in this process .    in the following we",
    "demonstrate how the mqcd string can be broken .",
    "we consider a world - manifold that will describe such a process or , equivalently , a family of m2 branes parameterized by time .",
    "this is described in figure [ f - scr ] .",
    "the physical and internal spaces are represented each by one direction .",
    "we also suppress one of the dimensions of the m2 brane , so each point represents a line ( either open or closed ) .",
    "we start with the left m2 brane ( figure [ f - scr]a ) , which represents a meson .",
    "a more detailed description of this m2 brane is given in figure [ f - mes ] .",
    "the vertical line in figure [ f - scr]a , extending in physical space , is the mqcd string ; each point on it is an open line ( see figure [ f - mes ] ) , like @xmath45 in figure [ f - sus ] .",
    "recall , however that it can be complemented by the curve @xmath56 to a closed curve , this corresponds to a transition from an mqcd string to a fundamental string and , therefore , should be highly suppressed dynamically .",
    "however , the kinematical possibility is still important , since we need to realize it only at _ discrete points _  the ends of the mqcd string .",
    "the corresponding dynamical suppression is related to the threshold for the production of a quark - anti - quark pair . ]",
    "the horizontal lines , extending only in the internal space , are the quarks ; each point on them represents a closed loop @xmath82 ( see figure [ f - mes ] ) ; these loops interpolate between the loops @xmath85 and @xmath84 , where @xmath84 is on a semi - infinite d4 brane .",
    "in fact , the two quarks can have different @xmath84 , being on different d4 branes ( which means a different flavor , like in a @xmath87 meson ) .",

    "the mqcd string @xmath45 may be chosen to connect two such points .",

    "a curve @xmath84 around this point winds once around @xmath32 .",
    "using this figure , we can demonstrate confinement and screening in this model , along the lines of the previous section .",
    "an m2 brane describing a quark should be a cylinder with a curve like @xmath84 as one of its two boundaries .",

    "so in this case , there are isolated quarks , which means that the confining force is completely screened ( loops around @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 correspond to screening by an adjoint of @xmath122 , bi - fundamental and adjoint of @xmath146 respectively ) .    when @xmath153 , there is no curve on @xmath29 that winds once around @xmath85 ( except at the region near @xmath154 , which is identified as a _ flavor _ d4 brane and not a _ color _ one ) .",
    "a possible boundary is @xmath155 , which corresponds to a quark attached to an mqcd string .",
    "so we conclude that in this case quarks can not exist in isolation and they are bound to ends of mqcd strings .",
    "we chose @xmath154 to be close to @xmath156 , which means that it is heavy and , therefore , decouples at low enough energies ( an infinite mass for this quark would correspond to @xmath157 ) .",
    "it is manifested geometrically by the fact that away from @xmath154 and @xmath156 , the curve is as for the model without fundamentals and an mqcd string is stable there  quarks are confined . at higher energies ,",
    "the region of @xmath154 and @xmath156 becomes accessible to the mqcd string and it can break .",
    "this is demonstrated by figure [ f - scr ] also for the present case , where this time @xmath84 and @xmath85 are as in figure [ f - lsu ] .",
    "to summarize , also for this model , we obtained results in agreement with the field theoretical expectations .",
    "we now move to the analysis of confinement and screening in models with @xmath14 or @xmath13 gauge groups .",
    "these models can be realized in type iia string theory @xcite by performing an orientifold projection , with a 4d orientifold plane ( o4 plane ) parallel to the d4 branes .",
    "the brane configuration is almost as in figure [ f - cfg ] , the only difference being that it is restricted to be symmetric around the o4 plane , which is the @xmath19 axis ( multiplied , as everything else , by @xmath28 ) .",
    "this means that the d4 branes can move off the @xmath19 axis only in symmetric pairs .",
    "there are two possible types of projections , one leading to @xmath14 gauge theory ( @xmath8 even ) with fundamental matter fields and the other , to @xmath13 gauge theory with matter in the vector representation . in both cases",
    "@xmath20 is even and there are @xmath158 @xmath9 hypermultiplets .",
    "the realization of fields and the identification of parameters and moduli is as in the @xmath7 model , described in subsection [ su - brane ] .",
    "so is the supersymmetry .",
    "these configurations also have a ( semi - classical ) m - theoretical description , as a single smooth m5 brane @xcite . as the type iia configuration",
    ", the m5 brane is also symmetric around the orientifold plane ( modulo a shift in the compact dimension , which is invisible in the type iia description ) .",
    "in addition , it was found that the o4 plane contributes additional tubes to the m5 brane , as would do d4 branes with the same rr charge .",
    "the charge of an o4 plane depends on the projection type . for an @xmath14 projection",
    "it is @xmath159 ( in units of d4 brane charge ) and for the @xmath13 projection it is @xmath160 . when an orientifold plane crosses a ns5 brane , the sign of its charge changes @xcite , so the ns5 brane feels a net charge of two units .",
    "this implies that in the @xmath14 model there are two extra tubes between the ns5 branes and in the @xmath13 model there are two extra tubes in the semi - infinite regions .",
    "these tubes can not move off the @xmath19 axis .",
    "when the ns5 branes are not parallel , all the finite tubes merge to a single tube , as in the @xmath7 model ; for orthogonal ns5 branes , corresponding to an @xmath0 model without an adjoint , @xmath29 assumes the following form @xcite t = v^-k(m - v)/m vw=:=[^3k-2fm]^ , where @xmath161 for @xmath14 and @xmath162 for @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding m5 brane is invariant under the transformation v - v w - w x^7-x^7 t(-1)^n t.    these models are also expected to be confining , so we would like to find the corresponding mqcd string , following the considerations in subsection [ sec - hom ] . since this should be an m2 brane , we have to determine first what is the effect of an orientifold projection on such branes .",
    "this will be considered in the next subsection .      in the m theoretical description of the o4 orientifold , the transformation @xmath163 which is gauged involves not only the space reflection ( [ reflect - m ] ) , but also an orientation reversal of the m2 brane .",
    "one way to see this is from 11d supergravity  the low energy approximation of m theory . to gauge @xmath163",
    ", it has to be a symmetry of the corresponding action .",
    "this action includes a term adada where @xmath164 is a 3-form field .",
    "the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) reverses the orientation of the 11d space - time ( inverts an odd number of coordinates ) , so to keep the term ( [ sugra ] ) @xmath163-invariant , @xmath164 should change sign ( as already observed in @xcite ) .",
    "the m2 brane couples to @xmath164 through a term @xmath165 , and to keep this term invariant too , the orientation of the m2 brane should be inverted . the same conclusion is obtained by considering the brane realization of @xmath166 susy quantum gauge theory ( corresponding to parallel ns5 branes ) .",
    "the central charge of a bps state is given by @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the seiberg - witten differential and @xmath82 is a homology cycle in @xmath29 .",
    "in m theory , a bps state is realized by an m2 brane @xmath55 with boundaries on the m5 brane (  on @xmath29 ) , the homology cycle @xmath82 is the boundary of @xmath55 and the integral gives the ( signed ) surface of this brane . in an orientifold model",
    ", the @xmath163-mirror @xmath169 of @xmath55 represents the same state and thus should lead to the same central charge .",
    "now one observes that @xmath170 is odd under the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) , while @xmath29 is symmetric for the @xmath9 models @xcite is not needed here .",
    "] , so the integral @xmath167 changes sign when @xmath82 is transformed by ( [ reflect - m ] ) and , to obtain the same central charge , the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) must be accompanied by a flip of orientation . finally , the flip in orientation is also consistent with the limit of ( perturbative ) type iia string theory .",
    "there , by definition , @xmath163 flips the orientation of the fundamental string . in m theory , a fundamental string corresponds to a tube - like m2 brane wrapped around the compact dimension , parameterized by @xmath32 .",
    "the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) does not change the @xmath32 direction , so the direction of the string is correlated with the orientation of the corresponding ( tube - like ) m2 brane .    for the analysis of the mqcd string",
    ", we need a characterization of the space of m2 brane configurations in a model with an o4 orientifold .",
    "if this was an `` orbifold model '' , obtained by gauging the reflection ( [ reflect - m ] ) , the answer would be clear : one would consider general m2 brane configurations in the _ quotient space _ @xmath171 , where = /_2 = ^6s^1 and @xmath172 is the reflection ( [ reflect - m ] ) . in the present case ,",
    "as explained above , the gauge transformation @xmath163 involves also an orientation reversal of the m2 brane , leading to an undetermined orientation in the quotient space , so to keep the information about the orientation , one has to consider also the _ covering space _ @xmath173 . in the covering space , one should consider general configurations , with the understanding that configurations related by @xmath163 should be identified .",
    "one should observe that there are closed configurations in the quotient space @xmath174 that are represented in the covering space @xmath173 by configurations that are _ not _ closed , , `` jump '' between points identified by @xmath163 ( the `` twisted '' sector ; leading to unoriented surfaces in @xmath174 ) so , in general , one should consider also such configurations .",
    "we now specialize to a configuration representing an mqcd string , looking for the conserved charge realizing the flux ( recall the discussion in subsection [ sec - hom ] ) .",
    "these are m2 branes ending on the m5 brane but , as in the previous models , one can start by classifying m2 branes in the absence of the m5 brane . to find a candidate for a conserved charge ,",
    "we consider first the case of a closed m2 brane in the covering space ( corresponding to an orientable m2 brane in the quotient space ) .",
    "the internal space is @xmath175 , the same as in the @xmath7 case , so these m2 branes seem to be characterized , as before , by the winding number of the cross - section @xmath176 around the compact dimension , leading to @xmath177 .",
    "however , here the situation is different .",
    "this is because we look for a physical property , which must be @xmath163-invariant ( since this is a gauge symmetry ) , while the winding number is not . to analyze this",
    ", it is worthwhile to consider the quotient space . denoting by @xmath45 the curve in @xmath30 that is the image of @xmath176 ,",
    "the winding number is _ dx^10= _",
    "cdx^10 , where the integration over @xmath45 is performed using the orientation induced on it by that of @xmath176 .",
    "different curves @xmath176 in @xmath178 which are related by @xmath163 , map to the same @xmath45 in @xmath30 , but induce on it a different ( continuous ) orientation , leading to a different winding number . for example , replacing @xmath176 by its @xmath163 image leads to the opposite orientation on @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath179 is @xmath163 invariant , the orientation flip implies an opposite winding number .",
    "this means that only the winding number modulo 2 _ can _ be gauge invariant and we now show that _ it is _ indeed gauge invariant . to show this , we should compare two different orientations . in general ,",
    "the orientations can be different only on a part of @xmath45 .",
    "this part is , however , necessarily closed ( since both orientations are continuous ) , so it contributes an integer to the winding number .",
    "therefore , when its orientation is flipped , the change in the winding number is even , so the winding number modulo 2 is invariant .",
    "the above argument also demonstrates that the winding number modulo 2 can be calculated directly in the quotient space @xmath30 , by choosing an _ arbitrary _ continuous orientation on @xmath45 .",
    "we return now to the general m2 brane , which can be also unorientable .",
    "the lack of orientability is a global property of the surface and will not be reflected in the classification of cross - sections , so these will still be classified by the winding number modulo 2 .",
    "the results obtained so far can be summarized as follows :    * the gauge invariant property that can be used to classify the cross - sections of an mqcd strings is a @xmath172 charge : the winding number modulo 2 of the cross - section around the compact dimension . *",
    "this property can be calculated directly in the quotient space @xmath30 , using eq .",
    "( [ wind ] ) with an arbitrary ( continuous ) orientation on the cross - section @xmath45 .",
    "next we analyze the dependence of the @xmath172 charge on the cross - section . for this ,",
    "let @xmath143 and @xmath144 be two cross - sections ( in the quotient space ) and @xmath55 the part of the m2 brane between them ( so @xmath180 is the boundary of @xmath55 ) .",
    "if @xmath55 is orientable , one can choose a global orientation and this leads , as in the @xmath7 case , to the same winding number for any two cross - sections , so the @xmath172 charge is trivially independent of the cross - section . to check the unorientable case ,",
    "let us represent it as an orientable surface with insertions of cross - cups .",
    "assuming even @xmath8 in the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) ( odd @xmath8 will be considered in subsection [ odd - n ] ) , @xmath32 is a gauge invariant function on @xmath55 .",
    "a difference in the winding numbers of @xmath143 and @xmath144 can be traced to a non - trivial winding for a loop around a cross - cup . however , since opposite points on a cross - cup are identified and , therefore have the same @xmath32 value , the winding number for a loop around the cross - cup is always even , so @xmath143 and @xmath144 have the same @xmath172 charge also in this case .",
    "we , therefore , have a well defined , gauge invariant @xmath172 charge for the mqcd string .",
    "to proceed , we consider each gauge group separately .      as for @xmath7 , we first consider the model without hypermultiplets ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "all the fields are in the adjoint representation , which is invariant under the center of the group .",
    "the center of @xmath181 is @xmath172 , so we expect an mqcd string with such a charge .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "as in the previous models , one can consider only closed cross - sections , by supplementing open ones with curves in @xmath29 .",
    "these were analyzed in the previous subsection and we obtained a @xmath172 charge that , in the absence of an m5 brane , was conserved .",
    "the m5 brane can lead to non - conservation by adding a loop in @xmath29 to a cross - section @xmath45 .",
    "the curve @xmath29 is given ( in the covering space ) by eq .",
    "( [ sg - sop ] ) ( with @xmath41 ) , leading to identification modulo @xmath142 in the winding number .",
    "@xmath182 is even so the @xmath172 charge is still conserved .",
    "this @xmath172 charge can , therefore , be identified with the center of the @xmath14 gauge group .",
    "figure [ f - sps ] describes two examples of an mqcd string ( or , more precisely , their cross - sections in the covering space ) , with a unit charge .",
    "this looks exactly as for @xmath7 ( compare to figure [ f - sus ] ) , but in that case @xmath176 and @xmath183 are distinct and carry different ( opposite ) @xmath42 charge ( winding number ) , while in the present case , they are @xmath163-equivalent , carrying _ the same _ ( @xmath172 ) charge .",
    "it is easy to see how two such strings can annihilate each other : @xmath183 can be rotated until it coincides with @xmath176 and they can join to a loop with a vanishing winding number , which can contract to a point .",
    "confinement and screening are analyzed in the same way as in @xmath7 , by introducing semi - infinite d4 branes , representing heavy quarks .",
    "also here m2 branes representing isolated quarks look as in figure [ f - qrk ] and are possible only when the ns5 branes are parallel . when the ns5 branes are rotated , the color d4 branes join to a single tube which winds around @xmath32 more then once",
    ", so a quark tube can not end on it .",
    "instead , it can connect to an mqcd string , whose cross section in the internal space is described in figure [ f - sps ] .",
    "so quarks are connected in pairs by a flux tube , forming singlets .",
    "note that unlike @xmath7 , in @xmath14 there is no distinction between the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations and any two quarks can combine to form a singlet ( being the analog of both mesons and baryons in @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is reflected correctly in the m theory description . in @xmath7 ,",
    "the two representations were distinguished by the orientation of the corresponding m2 branes and an mqcd string could connect only quark m2 branes of opposite orientation . here",
    ", the two orientations are related by @xmath163 so the mqcd string can connect any two quark m2 branes .    as in previous models , at low energies , compared to the mass of the quarks , the mqcd string is stable and there is confinement . at higher energies , pairs of quarks",
    "can be produced dynamically , screening the confining force .",
    "this process is described by figure [ f - scr ] also for the present case .    to summarize",
    ", we have reproduced all the results described in section 2 , also for the symplectic groups .",
    "we now turn to the orthogonal groups .",
    "the group @xmath13 is not simply connected : it is covered twice by its universal covering group @xmath186 , so @xmath187 .",
    "@xmath188 has a center of four elements - either @xmath189 ( for odd @xmath190 ) or @xmath191 ( for even @xmath190 ) , so this should be the charge of a general string in the model without hypermultiplets ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the search for the mqcd string is identical to the one for @xmath181 , with the same results : mqcd strings with a @xmath172 charge .",
    "this means that we do not obtain the full spectrum of possible mqcd strings , but actually this could be expected .",
    "a string ( flux tube ) with a unit charge would have to be connected to @xmath13 spinors .",
    "these are not realized in the present brane configuration , so it is reasonable that the corresponding strings are not realized either .",
    "we conclude that we have found an mqcd string carrying the charge of the _ vectorial _ representation of @xmath184 .",
    "this is verified when we add semi - infinite d4 branes , which realize quarks in this representation : the m2 branes realizing the quark states are bound in pairs by such a string , forming a meson , as in the @xmath181 model .",
    "the demonstration of confinement and screening is also identical in the two models .",
    "note , however , that not all charges are screened : the dynamical matter can screen ( for @xmath192 ) any external probe which is in a representation of @xmath184 ( rather then @xmath188 ) .",
    "when spinorial external probes are available , they should feel a confining force , but we do not have a description of those in the present formulation , so this can not be checked .      the center of @xmath194 is @xmath172 and the vectorial representation is uncharged under it ( being a representation of @xmath195 ) .",
    "therefore , in view of the discussion of the @xmath184 models , we expect here no mqcd string . to check this , we return to the discussion at the end of subsection [ s - m2 ] .",
    "the present case corresponds to odd @xmath8 in the transformation ( [ reflect - m ] ) , meaning that an orientation flip in @xmath55 is accompanied by a jump of @xmath196 in @xmath32 . a loop around a cross - cup will",
    ", therefore , have an _ odd _ winding number and this implies that there will always be cross - sections of the mqcd string with an even ,  trivial , winding number .",
    "thus , in the present case , although the @xmath172 charge of a specific cross - section of the string is well defined , it does not protect the string from breaking , since it is not the same for all cross - sections .",
    "this means that there is no stable mqcd string , in agreement with the field theoretical expectations .",
    "note that we obtained this result even before considering the m5 brane ! for completeness , let us nevertheless consider the influence of @xmath29 .",
    "it leads , as before , to identification modulo @xmath142 in the winding number and , since this time @xmath197 is odd , the @xmath172 charge of a cross - section is no longer conserved . as for @xmath184 ,",
    "the absence on a stable mqcd string means that matter in representations of @xmath193 ( and , in particular , the vectorial one ) is screened .",
    "spinorial charge is expected to be confined .",
    "in this work we used the realization of supersymmetric gauge theories in m theory to investigate confinement and screening .",
    "we considered the following ( @xmath0 supersymmetric ) models :    * @xmath9 susy @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath20 fundamental flavors , perturbed by a polynomial superpotential for the adjoint hypermultiplet ( @xmath0 sqcd can be seen as a special case of this family , for which the adjoint hypermultiplet is infinitely heavy ) ; * @xmath9 susy @xmath111 gauge theory with matter in fundamental and bi - fundamental representations , perturbed by masses for the adjoint hypermultiplets ; * @xmath14 gauge theory with @xmath20 fundamental hypermultiplets ; * @xmath13 gauge theory with @xmath20 vectorial hypermultiplets .",
    "for all the above models , we found results in agreement with the field theoretical expectations .",
    "starting without fundamental matter ( vectorial , for @xmath13 ) , the mqcd string ( , a candidate for the field theoretical electric flux tube ) was identified as an m2 brane ending on the m5 brane ( following @xcite ) .",
    "this string was shown to carry a topologically - conserved charge under a group isomorphic to the group @xmath11 of gauge transformations that act trivially on the fields in the field theory .",
    "this is in accord with the identification of this charge as the gauge charge that is _ not screened _ by the dynamical matter and , therefore , confined .",
    "we then introduced heavy quarks carrying unscreened charge and showed that they can not exist in isolation , but can be connected to an mqcd string , forming neutral mesons .",
    "this is a demonstration of confinement . finally , we considered higher energy scales , at which these quarks become dynamical and found that this destabilizes the mqcd string , demonstrating the screening of the charge that these quarks carry .",
    "in the @xmath13 models , we did not obtain strings carrying spinorial charge : for example , for @xmath184 , the mqcd string carries a @xmath172 charge ( which was shown to correspond to the vector representation ) , while the field theory expectation is for a charge group @xmath11 with 4 elements .",
    "the fact that the charge group was at most @xmath172 , followed from the topology of the internal space @xmath30 ( as implied by the o4 projection ) , and was independent of the m5 brane .",
    "this can serve as guidance in the search for a realization of models with spinors : the presence of heavy charge , since the vector screens the rest . ]",
    "spinors and vectors would imply the existence of a @xmath189 or @xmath198 charge group and to obtain such a charge , a different background is needed ( , larger orientifold group ) .",
    "a different configuration of ns5 branes and d4 branes would correspond to a different m5 brane in _ the same background _",
    ", so it will not lead to the desired result .",
    "the above considerations demonstrate that the properties of the mqcd string can be used in the identification of the field theoretical model realized by an m5 configuration , or serve as a consistency check .",
    "it is , therefore , worthwhile to perform this analysis in other such realizations .",
