    "it has been demonstrated in recent extensive studies that low - dimensional systems containing transition metals with open @xmath0-orbital shells may exhibit a multitude of interesting properties because of different oxidation and spin states , and relatively large spin - orbit coupling of the transitions metals .",
    "hence , transition metal - based low - dimensional systems provide an excellent ground for exploring and exploiting the internal degrees of freedom of electrons @xmath1 charge , orbital , and spin @xmath1 and their interplay for fundamental research and device applications  @xcite .",
    "there are many transition metal - based low dimensional systems in the literature , e.g. dichalcogenides , which have been or may potentially be exfoliated in the experiments  @xcite . among them , nowadays , mxenes  @xcite are truly at the cutting edge of materials research and promise new scientific and technological horizons .",

    "theoretically , many applications have been proposed for mxenes in electronic  @xcite , magnetic @xcite , optical  @xcite , thermoelectric  @xcite , and sensing devices  @xcite , as well as being new potential materials for catalytic and photocatalytic reactions  @xcite , hydrogen storage media  @xcite , and nanoscale superconductivity@xcite .",
    "some of mxenes are predicted to be topological insulators with large band gaps involving only @xmath0 orbitals  @xcite .",
    "mxenes are also expected to be used as ultralow work function materials  @xcite and schottky barrier junctions  @xcite .",
    "as the experimental and theoretical studies described above have already suggested , mxenes are appealing 2d systems because of the following reasons .",
    "1 ) owing to their ceramic nature , mxenes are chemically and mechanically stable .",
    "2 ) mxenes can be found in different forms of monolayer , few layers , and multilayers .",
    "3 ) mxenes can be synthesized as complex materials made of mixture of light and heavy transition metals , which makes it possible to tune the number of valence electrons and the relativistic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . this enhances their electronic functionality and mechanical stability .",
    "4 ) the thickness of mxene monolayers is controllable .",
    "this allows us to examine the quantum confinement related phenomena .",
    "5 ) the surfaces of mxenes can be functionalized with various chemical groups , which offers possibilities for surface state engineering .",
    "6 ) similar to graphene , some of mxenes exhibit massless dirac dispersions in their band structures near the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "this opens broad possibilities for dirac - based physics and applications  @xcite .",
    "these properties make mxenes unique among other known 2d materials although some of them have not been experimentally observed yet .",

    "before discussing the properties and applications of mxenes , it is worth summarizing briefly computational methods employed in the following theoretical studies of this review . among different methods ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) has proven to be a reliable method to predict various physical and chemical phenomena in atomic scale .",
    "hence , dft calculations are performed to examine many properties and applications of mxenes .",
    "however , it is known that the simple dft method may fail in predicting the values of band gap and van der walls interaction , and properties of strongly correlated materials . for instance",
    ", the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) version of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional  @xcite , which is most often used in this review , underestimates the band gap .",
    "hence , in some of the studies discussed below , the hybrid functional [ heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) ]  @xcite is employed to improve the estimation of the band gap , and the semi - empirical dft - d2 method ( grimme method )  @xcite is used to treat properly the van der walls interaction .",
    "furthermore , the dft+u method  @xcite is applied to correctly obtain magnetic order when the electron correlation in transition metals is important .",
    "because of the approximate nature of the dft - based methods  @xcite , this review mainly focuses on the general trends , which are expected in the physics and chemistry of mxenes , rather than emphasizing quantitatively the exact values of various properties . in the following ,",
    "the dft - pbe method is employed for the theoretical studies , unless otherwise stated .",
    "max phases are a large family of hexagonal layered ceramic compounds with symmetry group of p6@xmath9/mmc and with chemical formula of m@xmath2ax@xmath3 ( @xmath4=13 ) , where `` m '' , `` a '' , and `` x '' represent an early transition metal ( sc , ti , v , cr , zr , nb , mo , hf , and ta ) , an element from groups 1316 ( al , si , p , s , ga , ge , as , in , and sn ) in the periodic table , and carbon and/or nitrogen , respectively  @xcite . figure  [ fig : max](a ) shows the typical crystal structure of m@xmath7ax max phase compunds . over 60 different max phase compounds have already been synthesized experimentally  @xcite .",
    "max phases typically exhibit favorable properties of ceramics such as high structural stiffness , and also favorable properties of metals such as good electrical and thermal conductivity  @xcite .",

    "based on first - principles calculations , elastic constants of more than 240 different m@xmath7ac and m@xmath7an compounds with various m and a elements have been theoretically studied so far  @xcite . among these , many of the compounds are found to satisfy the mechanical stability criteria for hexagonal structures : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the second rank tensor of elastic constant  @xcite .",
    "therefore , many of them are elastically stable and have a great chance to be realized under appropriate experimental conditions .",
    "another computational screening study has analyzed the formation energies of 216 pure m@xmath7ax compounds and 10314 solid solution ( mm@xmath15)@xmath7(aa@xmath15)(xx@xmath15 )  @xcite , and found that 3140 compounds , including 49 experimentally known m@xmath7ax phases , exhibit formation energies of less than @xmath16 mev / atom .",
    "a significant subsets of 301 compositions with formation energy lower than @xmath17 mev / atom exhibit favorable synthesis conditions .",
    "recently , the family of max phases has also been theoretically extended to m@xmath7alb compounds  @xcite .",
    "the formation energy ( @xmath18 ) calculations find that e@xmath19(m@xmath7aln ) <",
    "e@xmath19(m@xmath7alc ) < e@xmath19(m@xmath7alb )  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the m@xmath7aln phases will likely be obtained with higher purity in experiments .",
    "this trend of the formation energies for max phases is understood by considering several entangled factors , i.e. , 1 ) the strength of hybridization between @xmath0 orbitals of m and others ( @xmath20 orbitals of al , and @xmath21 and @xmath20 orbitals of x ) , 2 ) the number of valence electrons that fill bonding , nonbonding , and antibonding states , and 3 ) the required energy for volume expansion of the transition metals to host the x elements  @xcite .",

    "more detailed analysis shows that the number of valence electrons per unit cell ( valence electron concentration ) , which fill the bonding and antiboding states , can affect and control the formation energy and the mechanical property of max phases significantly  @xcite .",

    "2d mxenes are experimentally obtained when the `` a '' element is washed out from the max phases upon applying appropriate acid solution such as hf  @xcite .",
    "this is possible because in some of the max phases the bonding between elements a and m is weaker than those between elements m and x. however , it is experimentally observed that the outer layers are often saturated with f , o , and/or oh groups when mxenes are chemically exfoliated by hf acid solutions to eliminate the `` a '' element  @xcite .    the exfoliation process of ti@xmath9alc@xmath7 to ti@xmath9c@xmath7 has been theoretically studied in the presence of water and hf acid using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "there , it is shown that the spontaneous dissociation of hf and subsequent termination with h or f at the edge of ti atoms make al - m bonding weak , consequently opening the interlayer gap .",
    "the further insertion of hf is facilitated through the interlayer gap .",
    "this leads to the formation of alf@xmath9 and h@xmath7 , which eventually come out of the max phase .",

    "since the max phases have hexagonal symmetry , the derived mxene systems form hexagonal lattices with the same symmetry . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mxene1](a ) , 2d m@xmath7x mxene consists of trilayer sheets with a hexagonal - like unit cell , where the `` x '' layer is sandwiched by two `` m '' transition metal layers . since the coordination number of a transition metal ion is often six , it is natural to assume that the transition metals in mxenes make six chemical bonds with the neighboring x atoms and the attached chemical groups on the surfaces , resulting in the formation of m@xmath7xf@xmath7 , m@xmath7x(oh)@xmath7 , and m@xmath7xo@xmath7  @xcite .    on the surfaces of m@xmath7x , two types of hollow sites exist : hollow sites ( a ) under which there is no `` x '' atom between the transition metal layers and hollow sites ( b ) under which there is a `` x '' atom , as indicated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mxene1](a ) .",
    "therefore , depending on the relative positions of the termination groups attached to the transition metal atoms , four different configurations are possible for the chemical termination of the m@xmath7x system .",
    "model 1 : two functional groups locate on top of the two transition metals .",
    "model 2 : two functional groups are on top of hollow sites a. model 3 : one of the functional groups locates on top of a hollow site a and the other functional group locates on top of a hollow site b. model 4 : the two functional groups locate on top of hollow sites b. figures  [ fig : mxene1](b ) and [ fig : mxene1](c ) show the schematic top and side views of models 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "these four models should be considered for each type of functional groups with fully relaxing atomic positions to determine the most stable structure . as a general trend in functionalized mxenes , model 1 is energetically less stable than other three models and in many cases it is transformed to one of models 24 during structure optimization .",
    "it is also found that the relative structural stabilities of models 24 depend mainly on possible ionic state(s ) of the transition metals on the surfaces  @xcite .",
    "if the transition metals can provide sufficient electrons to both x and the attached functional groups , model 2 becomes the most stable configuration  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , either model 3 or model 4 is a more stable configuration  @xcite .    in order to understand the stability of functionalized mxenes",
    ", the formation energy has to be evaluated .",
    "first - principles calculations find that mxenes can gain a very large amount of negative formation energy when the surfaces are functionalized  @xcite .",
    "this indicates the formation of strong bonds between the transition metals and the attached groups , which encourages synthesizing mxenes with particular surface functionalization  @xcite .",
    "it has also been examined whether the surfaces of fully functionalized mxene are thermodynamically more favorable than those of less functionalized mxene  @xcite .",
    "it is indeed shown theoretically that the surfaces are fully functionalized at particular chemical potentials in some of the mxene systems  @xcite .",
    "phonon frequency analyses have proved that many of these mxenes with full surface functionalization are locally stable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , various fully functionalized mxenes can be realized experimentally in appropriate conditions although there are still some challenges .",
    "the effect or surface functionalization on elastic constant @xmath27 of mxenes have been studied using first - principles calculations  @xcite .",
    "it is found that oxygen functionalized mxenes exhibit smaller lattice parameters and larger @xmath27 as compared to those functionalized with f or oh  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the stronger bonding between o and surface transition metals .        in another theoretical study ,",
    "the thickness dependence of mechanical properties of pristine 2d ti@xmath2c@xmath3 ( @xmath4=1 , 2 , and 3 ) has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the young s moduluses , extracted from the slope of strain - stress curves , are found to be 597 , 502 , and 534 gpa for ti@xmath7c , ti@xmath9c@xmath7 , and ti@xmath22c@xmath9 , respectively  @xcite , and thus it is the highest for the thinest mxene .",
    "it is also observed that ti@xmath7c and ti@xmath9c@xmath7 show similar behavior under high tensile stress : the bond breaking begins in the outermost regions of the layer at the point of the highest local stress and propagates deeper into the center of the system . the crack propagation in these systems is accompanied by crumpling and folding of the layer near the growing gap @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cracks in ti@xmath22c@xmath9 occur first in the central region of the layer . at larger stress ,",
    "these cracks grow in size , leading to the complete fracture of the sample with the formation of several ti@xmath22c@xmath9 fragments  @xcite .    the effect of f , oh , and o functionalization on the response of ti@xmath2c@xmath3 ( @xmath4=1 , 2 , and 3 ) to the tensile stress has also been investigated theoretically to show that ti@xmath7co@xmath7 can sustain large strain under biaxial and uniaxial tension much better than graphene  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pristine 2d ti@xmath2c@xmath3 ( @xmath4=1 , 2 , and 3 ) is vulnerable against the tensile strain because the surface atomic layer collapses easily .",
    "however , the surface functionalization can slow down this collapse and thus improves the mechanical flexibility  @xcite .",
    "the unique strengthening by oxygen functionalization is attributed to the significant charge transfer from the inner ti - c bonds to the outer ti - o surface ones  @xcite .    although the f , o , and oh terminations weaken the interlayer coupling as compared with the pristine counterparts , the interlayer coupling is still significantly stronger than van der waals bonding as specified by the fact that the binding energies of stacked ti@xmath2c@xmath3t@xmath7 ( t = f , oh , or o ) are 26 times larger than those of well - known graphite and mos@xmath7 with weak interlayer coupling  @xcite",
    ". therefore , the successful exfoliation of stacked ti@xmath2c@xmath3t@xmath7 with binding energies in the range of 1 - 1.33 jm@xmath28 into monolayers invariably requires further weakening of the interlayer coupling  @xcite .",
    "the interlayer coupling in the oh - terminated ti@xmath2c@xmath3 is stronger than that in the f- or o - terminated one because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the layers in the former  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the experimentally obtained mxenes are not structurally perfect .",
    "the recent scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) and electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) experiments show that point defects are present on the surfaces that can affect the local surface chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the defects are formed when the surface transition metals are etched / removed by the hf in the etchant solution .",
    "thus , changing the hf concentration in the etchant should vary the defect concentration  @xcite .",
    "this gives us the ability to control the surface properties for catalytic , energy storage , and other applications .",
    "however , the existence of a defect does not affect significantly the metallic properties of mxenes  @xcite .",
    "although mxenes are made by chemical exfoliation of max phases , their synthesis through mechanical exfoliation of max phases may also be possible .",
    "this is because in some of the max phases elastic constants satisfy @xmath27 > @xmath29 , which indicates that the overall bondings along the @xmath30 plane is stronger than the @xmath31 direction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath27 , it might be more feasible to break the m@xmath1a@xmath1 m bonds under appropriate mechanical tension without significantly damaging the m@xmath1x@xmath1 m bonds  @xcite .",
    "similar to the max phases , the pristine mxenes are all metallic .",
    "however , upon surface functionalization , some of the mxenes become semiconducting . as will be discussed below , theoretical investigations have shown that the mxenes can be divided into two categories , topologically trivial  @xcite and nontrivial  @xcite metal / semimetal or semiconductor , depending on the strength of relativistic soc in these systems .      while most of the functionalized mxenes are metallic , sc@xmath7ct@xmath7 ( t= f , oh , and o ) , ti@xmath7co@xmath7 , zr@xmath7co@xmath7 , and hf@xmath7co@xmath7 become semiconducting with the surface functionalization .",
    "the energy gaps are estimated to be 1.03 , 0.45 , and 1.8 ev for sc@xmath7ct@xmath7 with t= f , oh , and o , respectively , 0.24 ev for ti@xmath7co@xmath7 , 0.88 ev for zr@xmath7co@xmath7 , and 1.0 ev for hf@xmath7co@xmath7 within general gradiente approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "the band structure calculations reveal that sc@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 has a direct band gap and the other semiconductors have indirect band gaps .",
    "since ti , zr , and hf are in the same group in the periodic table with the same number of electrons in the outermost partially filled atomic orbital shell ( [ ar]3d@xmath324s@xmath32 , [ kr]4d@xmath325s@xmath32 , and [ xe]4f@xmath335d@xmath326s@xmath32 ) , the corresponding mxene systems exhibit the similar metallic to semiconducting behavior upon the same type of functionalization .",
    "it is also predicted that both f and oh groups affect similarly the electronic structure of a pristine mxene system  @xcite .",
    "this is simply because each f or oh group is capable of receiving only one electron from the surfaces . by the same token , the o group differs from the f and oh groups because it demands two electrons from the surfaces to be stabilized  @xcite .    in order to understand why some of the mxenes become semiconducting , the electronic structures of mxenes with and without the surface functionalizations have been systematically studied  @xcite .",
    "the calculations show that pristine m@xmath7x ( x = c or n ) systems are all metallic with the fermi energy locating at the @xmath0 bands of transition metal m. in most mxenes , the @xmath20 bands of carbon / nitrogen x appear below the @xmath0 bands separated by a small band gap . with the f ,",
    "oh , or o functionalization , new bands are generated below the fermi energy , resulting from f or o @xmath20 orbitals hybridized with m @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "sc@xmath7ct@xmath7 ( t= f , oh , or o ) , ti@xmath7co@xmath7 , zr@xmath7co@xmath7 , and hf@xmath7co@xmath7 turn to be semiconducting because the functionalization shifts the fermi energy to the center of the gap between m @xmath0 bands and x @xmath20 bands . as examples , fig .  [",

    "it has also been shown that the band gap of ti@xmath7co@xmath7 and sc@xmath7co@xmath7 can be significantly varied by applying either strain  @xcite or external electric field  @xcite .",
    "since many of mxenes contain heavy 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals , the relativistic soc affects the electronic structures significantly . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nontrivial ] , without considering the soc , m@xmath7co@xmath7 ( m= mo , w ) and m@xmath5m@xmath6c@xmath7o@xmath7 ( m@xmath15= mo , w ; m@xmath6= ti , zr , w ) are semiconducting with a zero energy gap ( semimetallic ) because the topmost valence band and the lowest conduction band touch only at the @xmath10 point , around which the valence and conduction bands are both parabolic .",
    "the projected band structure calculations reveal that the bands near the femi energy originate from @xmath0 orbitals of transition metals m , or m@xmath15 and m@xmath6 . upon considering the soc ,",

    "sc@xmath7c with the largest surface area among all mxenes possesses the 9.0 wt.@xmath53 , which is higher than gravimetric storage capacity target , 5.5 wt.@xmath53 by 2015 , set by united states department of energy .",
    "it has also been shown that the hydrogens are bound to sc@xmath7c by chemical , physical , and kubas - type interactions with the binding energy of 4.703 , 0.087 , and 0.164 ev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that when the hydrogens are bound with the surfaces strongly , it is very difficult to take them out from the storage media . therefore , these hydrogens can not be used for the energy production .",
    "li - ion batteries can produce high gravimetric energy density and high voltage as large as 110160 wh / kg  @xcite and 3.6 v  @xcite , respectively . therefore , there are extensive theoretical and experimental studies to design novel alkali - based batteries with high gravimetric energy density and voltage  @xcite .",
    "recently , the intercalation between 2d ti@xmath9c@xmath7t@xmath52 mxene layers and several ions such as li@xmath94 , na@xmath94 , mg@xmath95 , k@xmath94 , nh@xmath96 , and al@xmath97 has been reported to induce high capacitance up to 350 f/@xmath98  @xcite .",
    "moreover , li ion batteries in ti@xmath7c , ti@xmath9c@xmath7 , ti@xmath9cn , and tinbc have been experimentally examined  @xcite .",
    "it is found that ti@xmath9c@xmath7 shows excellent li - ion steady - state capacity of 410 mahg@xmath68 at a one - cycling rate  @xcite .",
    "these important experimental achievements have triggered many further theoretical studies on supercapacity and alkali - metal ion battery properties of mxenes  @xcite . in these theoretical studies , the effect of functionalization on mobility of various alkali - metals and ions ( li , na , k , ca ) in pristine mxenes ,",
    "ti@xmath7c , zr@xmath7c , v@xmath7c , nb@xmath7c , cr@xmath7c , ti@xmath7n , v@xmath7n , ta@xmath7n",
    ", ti@xmath9c@xmath7 , v@xmath9c@xmath7 , and v@xmath9n@xmath7 , as well as functionalized mxenes with f , o , oh , o , s , se , and te have been systematically studied .",
    "for instance , m@xmath7c ( m= sc , ti , v , and cr ) has gravimetric capacity over 400 mah / g , which is higher than the gravimetric capacity of graphite  @xcite .",
    "the simulations on li storage in ti@xmath9c@xmath7 indicate that the pristine mxenes have low diffusion barrier ( 0.07 ev ) and high li storage capacity @xcite .",
    "it should be recalled that the li storage capacity of graphite is 372 mah / g in lic@xmath99  @xcite and the diffusion barrier for li in graphite is @xmath1000.3 ev  @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the mxenes may be superior to graphite electrodes .",
    "however , in functionalized ti@xmath9c@xmath7 , due to steric hindrance induced by f , oh , and o groups , li ions face higher diffusion barriers as large as 0.36  @xcite , 1.02  @xcite , and 0.62  @xcite ev , respectively .",
    "consequently , the li storage in the functionalized mxenes with f , o , and oh decreases as compared with the pristine mxenes .",
    "various theoretical studies have shown that mxenes , particularly pristine ones , are overall promising in increasing the battery performance  @xcite .",
    "c(oh)@xmath7 heterostructure  @xcite .",
    "arrows in ( b ) indicate the position of the dirac cone at the k point and the nearly free electron band band at the @xmath10 point .",
    "the fermi energy is located at zero energy .",
    "( c ) electron localization function ( elf ) counter plot and ( d ) charge transfer ( @xmath101 ) isosurfaces with @xmath1020.005 e / @xmath103 for graphene / hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7  @xcite . the excess and depleted charges ( electrons ) are shown in dark orchid and deep pink colors , respectively , in ( d ) . ]",
    "although there is no experimental report on the formation of nanotubes , nanoribbons , or hetreostructures of mxenes , there exist many positive signs to expect that they might be realized experimentally .",
    "in fact , experiments have observed that mxenes can be formed in the conical scrolls  @xcite , and demonstrated that mxenes can be used as filler in polymer composites  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the chemical vapor deposition technique can be employed to synthesize mxenes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been several theoretical studies on nanoribbon , nanotube , and heterostructure mxenes . for example , the electronic structure and formation energy calculations on pristine and functionalized sc@xmath7c nanotubes indicate that the stability and the band gap of the mxene nanotubes can be controlled significantly by their radii  @xcite . another study has shown that the strain energies of ti@xmath7c nanotubes are always positive , whereas those of ti@xmath7co@xmath7 nanotubes become negative when the diameter is beyond 2.5 nm .",
    "this indicates that 2d ti@xmath7co@xmath7 can possibly be folded into a nanotube form  @xcite .",
    "the first - principles calculations for armchair and zigzag nanoribons of pristine and functionalized ti@xmath7c , ti@xmath9c@xmath7 , and v@xmath7c  @xcite have shown that i ) there is a remarkable atomic reconstruction at the edges of nanoribbons , ii ) hydrogen functionalization can increase magnetic moment as compared with the pristine nanoribbon , and iii ) armchair ti@xmath7co@xmath7 nanoribbon with a width of 7.34   exhibits a band gap of @xmath1001.0 ev , which is significantly larger than that of 2d ti@xmath7co@xmath7 ( @xmath104 ev )  @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the hole and electron carrier mobility of the ti@xmath7co@xmath7 nanoribbon can be tuned by the width as well as the edge engineering  @xcite .",
    "more comprehensive calculations reveal that the band gap of semiconducting mxene nanoribbons is determined by a combination of factors such as the quantum confinement , the energy location of edge states , and the strength of @xmath0-@xmath0 hybridization  @xcite .",
    "fabricating van der waals heterostructures of mxenes , and their stacking with chalcogenides , graphene or other 2d systems can be an innovative route to develop materials with exotic properties .",
    "this is promising since similar complex systems have been experimentally realized  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind the stacking of different 2d layers is the band gap engineering and combining the electronic properties of different 2d layers together into a single 3d crystalline composite with substantially tailored electronic properties .",
    "for example , the electronic structures of graphene / hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7  @xcite , mos@xmath7/ti@xmath7c , mos@xmath7/ti@xmath7ct@xmath7 (",
    "t = f and oh )  @xcite , silicine / sc@xmath7cf@xmath7  @xcite , sc@xmath7cf@xmath7/sc@xmath7co@xmath7  @xcite , and various transition metal dichalcogenides / m@xmath7co@xmath7 ( m = sc , ti , zr , and hf )  @xcite heterostructures have been studied based on first - principles calculations .    among these studies",
    ", it has been found that the transition metal dichalcogenides / sc@xmath7co@xmath7 heterostructures show indirect band gaps in the range of 0.131.18 ev , which are suitable for electronic device applications  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : hetero ] shows the density of states , projected band structure , excess - depletion charge density ( @xmath101 ) , and electron localization function ( elf ) for graphene / hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 heterostructure  @xcite .",
    "these results clearly show that the graphene is @xmath4-doped by hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 and this is simply because of the ultra low work function of hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 ( @xmath105 ev ) as compared with graphene ( @xmath106 ev )  @xcite .",
    "however , the dirac - cone like energy dispersion of the graphene remains intact [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : hetero](b ) ] , and is simply shifted to lower energies at @xmath107 ev by receiving electrons from hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 .",
    "figures  [ fig : hetero](c ) and [ fig : hetero](d ) show that electrons are mainly transferred from oh bonds in hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 to @xmath108 states of the graphene .",
    "since the graphene and hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 are semi - metallic and metallic , respectively , it is expected that the graphane / hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 heterostructure exhibits metallic current - voltage characteristics . due to the small distance between hydrogen atoms and graphene ( 2.27  ) ,",
    "the electrons are localized either on hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 or on graphene .",
    "however , it is clear that the nfe state remains stable on the other side of hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7 without graphene .",
    "moreover , the elf analysis indicates that there is no chemical bond between the graphene and hf@xmath7c(oh)@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the research on low - dimensional materials is still at a preliminarily stage and will stay as a very exciting field of science and technology for many years . in particular , the mxenes era has just emerged in the cutting - edge materials research arena .",
    "it has already been proved that mxenes are suitable materials for interdisciplinary research and collaboration between academia and industry .",
    "synthesizing mxenes with a particular surface functionalization is one of the main experimental challenges in this field .",
    "since some of the max phases ( mo@xmath7gac ) are low temperature superconductors  @xcite , it is timely to examine the superconductivity properties of various mxenes . our knowledge for photonic properties and solar harvesting applications of mxenes are still limited . it might be possible to grow lateral mxenes using chemical vapor deposition technique",
    "therefore , it might be interesting to study the lateral mxene heterostructures computationally .",
    "it has been demonstrated theoretically that 2d topological insulators might be promising thermoelectric materials  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth examining the theormoelectric properties of the topological mxenes .",
    "catalytic and nanostructure properties of mxenes have not been well studied yet .",
    "there are still very few theoretical studies on electron transport , optical , and magnetic properties of mxenes .",
    "we hope that this review could provide a broad insight into the current status of research and applications of mxenes , and stimulate further studies .",
