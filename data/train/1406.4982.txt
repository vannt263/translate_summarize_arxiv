    "among the different classes of conductor - insulator composites , nanogranular metal films are quite unique materials as they display distinct and tunable electrical , optical , and magnetic properties depending on the nature and concentration of the metallic phase , as well as on the structure of the films.@xcite in the preparation of this class of composites , various sputtering , evaporation , and ion implantation methods are used to deposit immiscible metals and insulators on a substrate to form composite films with a wide range of the volume fraction @xmath0 of the metallic phase . at large @xmath0 ,",
    "the composite is basically a metallic continuum whose electronic conductivity @xmath1 is limited by grain boundaries and scattering with few insulating inclusions .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , @xmath1 is lowered by the enhanced concentration of the insulating phase .",
    "this `` metallic regime '' persists until matrix inversion occurs at a material dependent critical value @xmath2 , below which the metallic continuum is broken up into disconnected metallic particles or clusters dispersed in the insulating phase . in this `` dielectric regime '' ,",
    "electrons flow throughout the composite only by tunneling or hopping processes between isolated , and homogeneously dispersed , nanometric metallic particles .    these two distinct , structurally driven , transport regimes are very different in nature , as seen from the temperature and relative concentration dependences of @xmath1 . above @xmath2 ,",
    "granular metal films are assimilable to percolative systems in which coalescing metallic particles form a system spanning conductive network . as a function of @xmath0 , the resulting conductivity for @xmath3 is thus expected to follow a percolation power - law behavior of the form:@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the universal transport exponent for three - dimensional ( two - dimensional ) systems .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath8 transport shows typically a metallic behavior , with the resistivity increasing linearly with the temperature .",
    "in contrast to the percolation mechanism implied by eq .  , tunneling between submicron conducting particles in the dielectric regime hints to the absence of any `` critical '' concentration , as electrons have to tunnel across interparticle distances that increase gradually as @xmath0 is reduced . considering that in the limit of dilute particles of size @xmath9 the mean particle separation @xmath10 scales as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the system dimensionality , the tunneling conductivity @xmath13 for sufficiently large temperatures is thus expected to follow : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the tunneling decay length and @xmath16 is a dimensionless constant , which for point particles dispersed in a three - dimensional ( two - dimensional ) volume takes up the value @xmath17 ( @xmath18).@xcite as a function of temperature @xmath19 , the dielectric regime is associated with a stretched exponential behavior of the form : @xmath20 which arises from tunneling processes in the presence of a coulomb gap.@xcite equation   applies for temperatures lower than a @xmath0-dependent characteristic temperature , @xmath21 , which typically increases from @xmath22 k for @xmath23 to a few thousands of kelvin for @xmath0 values deep in the dielectric region.@xcite    the limiting @xmath0-dependencies of @xmath1 highlighted in eqs .   and arise from general considerations which do not rely on the detailed knowledge of the composite film morphology .",
    "however , while eq .   is shown to properly fit the measured @xmath1 in the metallic regime,@xcite the exponential behavior of eq .",
    "is less often used to interpret the observed @xmath0-dependence of the dielectric regime.@xcite in ref .  , for example , the dielectric region is understood in terms of eq .   with a tunneling - induced nonuniversal exponent,@xcite while in refs .",
    "additional percolation transitions are considered to be active in the @xmath24 region .",
    "the power law behavior of eq .  , or its generalizations , requires however either a cut - off in the inter - particle conductances,@xcite or very peculiar ( crystal - like ) arrangements of the metallic particles in the matrix,@xcite both of which are difficult to justify from the disordered morphology of nanogranular films in the dielectric regime . furthermore , the variable range hopping mechanism at the basis of the stretched exponential behavior of eq .",
    "is , in principle , incompatible with the notion of a fixed cut - off distance between the particles . from these considerations",
    ", we see that although the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is quite well understood,@xcite there is still no general consensus on how to interpret the behavior of the conductivity as a function of the metallic content at fixed temperatures .",
    "in particular , there is a need to further understand the different regimes of granular metals within a single , coherent , description .    in this paper",
    ", we present an effective medium formulation that naturally accounts for the metallic ( percolation ) and dielectric ( tunneling ) regimes of granular thick films , and the transition between them . with the term `` thick film '' we mean that the film thickness is much larger than the typical particle size , so that the system is three dimensional . by considering general properties of the microstructure and of the electrical connectedness",
    ", we clarify how the percolation behavior of eq",
    ".   for @xmath8 evolves into the exponential one of eq .   for @xmath24 .",
    "in this way , we can reproduce the room temperature conductivity data of several composite films in the whole range of @xmath0 , and extract from experiments the tunneling characteristics , the percolation threshold , and the microscopic conductances governing the overall conductivity behavior . furthermore , by using a cherry - pit model for the conductive particle dispersion in the films , we identify the different observed values of @xmath2 in terms of partial overlaps between the particles , providing thus a simple microscopic interpretation for the location of the dielectric - metallic transition .",
    "lower than the percolation threshold @xmath2 , the composite is constituted by dispersions of isolated particles and clusters of overlapping particles . for @xmath8",
    "the film microstructure is modeled as a continuum of overlapping spheres with isolated voids .",
    "@xmath2 is the critical volume fraction for the percolation of overlapping spheres .",
    "( b ) model of inter - particle conductances .",
    "for any two overlapping spheres , the conductance is set equal to @xmath25 , as for spheres @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "when two particles do not overlap , their conductance is chosen to be of tunneling type , as for spheres @xmath26 and @xmath28 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 . ]",
    "[ matrix ]    during the deposition process of granular metal films , the metallic particles nucleate and grow giving rise to a spatial distribution of the metallic grains which depends on the relative amount of metallic and insulating phases , on the interaction between them , and on the film growth conditions .",
    "detailed description of film microstructure requires thus specific knowledge of the microscopic processes governing the spatial distribution of the two phases . however , observational studies of many different film microstructures evidence quite general features , such as homogeneity and disorder of particle dispersions , nanometric size of metallic grains in the dielectric regime , and matrix inversion in the transition region .",
    "these generic features can be taken into account without detailed knowledge of the processes governing them by employing a minimal model of the microstructure chosen as to capture the essential aspects .    to define a minimal model for granular metal films we consider spherical metallic particles with equal diameter @xmath9 dispersed in a continuum insulating medium .",
    "we simulate coalescing between the metallic particles by allowing the spheres to overlap to some extent . at low volume fractions , the metallic phase is thus composed primarily of isolated spheres , while at large @xmath0 the composite consists basically of a metallic continuum with few isolated voids , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the regions of low and large @xmath0 correspond respectively to the dielectric and metallic regimes of the granular films .",
    "the critical volume fraction @xmath2 separating these two regions corresponds to the geometrical percolation threshold for intersecting spheres , i.e. , @xmath2 is the smallest @xmath0 such that a system spanning cluster of overlapping spheres exists .",
    "the specific value of @xmath2 depends on the degree of particle overlapping and on the statistical properties of the dispersion , which however we do not specify at the moment .    to model the electrical connectedness at the microscopic level ,",
    "we define two kinds of interparticle conductances , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "when two particles overlap , as for example particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we assume that the interparticle conductance is constant and independent of the degree of overlapping . between nonoverlapping particles , instead , we ascribe a tunneling conductance which decays exponentially with the relative distance between the particles , as for the pairs of spheres @xmath29 and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "for any two given spheres @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the interparticle conductance assumes thus the following form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distance between the sphere centers and @xmath15 is the tunneling decay length .",
    "the prefactors @xmath25 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "are in general different : @xmath35 is in principle smaller or much smaller than the conductance of two coalesced particles as the electron has to cross an interfacial barrier even if two particles are at contact .",
    "furthermore , for the case of nanosized ferromagnetic particles , @xmath35 depends also on the relative spin polarization.@xcite    in writing eq .",
    "we assume that particle charging and coulomb interaction effects do not appreciably contribute to the exponential decay for @xmath36 .",
    "although strictly valid for infinite temperatures , this approximation is nevertheless justified for granular metals at room temperature and with metallic contents not much below @xmath2 , as in this case the variable range hopping characteristic temperature in eq .",
    "is typically @xmath22 k.@xcite since we are interested in the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath1 at room temperature , we can think of the prefactor @xmath35 as to partially include particle charging and coulomb interactions .      we proceed to evaluating the composite film conductivity by using an effective medium approximation ( ema ) previously applied successfully to a number of different conductor - insulator composites.@xcite a detailed derivation of ema",
    "is presented in ref .  .",
    "here we describe a simple method to derive the ema equation within the two - site approximation by considering a system of @xmath37 metallic spheres dispersed in a volume @xmath38 .",
    "we then construct a resistor network whose node positions coincide with the centers of the spherical particles .",
    "the corresponding bond conductances are given by the set of @xmath39 conductances of eq .  .",
    "this network is complete , which means that to each pair of nodes is associated a finite conductance @xmath40 . the two - point resistance @xmath41 between any two nodes @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 is thus a well defined quantity , from which we construct the average resistance of the network : @xmath42 where @xmath43 indicates a configurational average and the prime symbol means that the term with @xmath44 is omitted from the summation .",
    "we can express @xmath41 as given by the direct resistance between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath45 , in parallel with the resistance @xmath46 of a network in which @xmath40 has been removed from the system : @xmath47 next , we introduce a second ( effective ) network , with spatial distribution of nodes identical to the original one , in which the conductances are all identically equal to @xmath48 , independently of the node indexes .",
    "this second network is a complete network whose two - point resistance is simply given by @xmath49.@xcite we want to find @xmath48 such that the resistance difference between the two networks @xmath50 vanishes . to this end , we apply the two - site ema which amounts to replacing @xmath51 by the two - point conductance of the effective network minus the direct contribution between @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath52 so that eq .   reduces to : @xmath53 imposing @xmath54 to the above expression , after some algebra and setting @xmath55 we find the following equation for the effective conductance @xmath56:@xcite @xmath57 since the conductances @xmath40 in eq .",
    "depend only upon the relative distances @xmath34 , we can replace the summation over @xmath58 by an integral over the continuous distance @xmath59.@xcite by using eq .",
    "we thus obtain for three dimensional systems : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the radial distribution function for the conducting spheres,@xcite and @xmath62 is the coordination number for intersecting spheres , which measures how many spheres on average overlap a given sphere for a given concentration.@xcite finally , @xmath63 is the particle number density which , depending on the degree of sphere overlapping , determines the fractional coverage @xmath0 of the metallic phase .      equations and enable us to relate the behavior of the overall transport with the morphology of the composite through the radial distribution function @xmath64 , once this is known .",
    "detailed knowledge of @xmath64 is however not necessary to extract some important limiting behaviors of @xmath56 from the solution of eq .  .",
    "for example , the ema dielectric regime is obtained by noticing that in the dilute limit @xmath65 the metallic particles are uncorrelated [ @xmath66 and practically do not overlap [ @xmath67 . in this way , the first term in the left - hand side of eq . can be neglected and the ema equation reduces to : @xmath68 where we have set @xmath69 .",
    "the above integral is exactly solvable and the left - hand side of eq .  , which we denote by @xmath70 ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of polylogarithm functions .",
    "we find it more practical , however , to use for @xmath70 the following approximation which is very accurate for all values of @xmath56 : @xmath71 ^ 3 - 1\\right\\}.\\ ] ] from @xmath72 we thus find for small @xmath0 : @xmath73\\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\underset{\\phi\\rightarrow 0}{\\longrightarrow } g_t\\exp\\left(-1.26\\frac{d}{\\xi\\phi^{1/3}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the same asymptotic behavior of eq .  .",
    "equation   can also be recovered from the method described in ref .  .",
    "to obtain the ema version for the percolating regime , we neglect the tunneling contributions in eq .  .",
    "the ema equation reduces to @xmath74 , from which we find : @xmath75.\\ ] ] since @xmath76 increases monotonically with @xmath0 , @xmath56 is non - negative only for @xmath77 , where @xmath2 satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "hence , by expanding eq .   in the vicinity of @xmath2 we obtain for @xmath79 : @xmath80 which is the ema equivalent of the percolation conductivity of eq .",
    ", in which the transport exponent is unity rather than @xmath6 .",
    "as a function of the volume fraction @xmath0 of conducting spheres as obtained from numerical solutions of eq .  .",
    "the critical volume fraction @xmath2 for overlapping spheres is fixed at @xmath81 .",
    "( a ) @xmath56 for different values of @xmath82 at fixed @xmath83 . for @xmath84",

    "the starting point is eq .  , which we modify in the following way .",
    "first , motivated by the observation that the microstructure of the film is expected to have little influence in the dilute particle limit @xmath65 , where tunneling dominates , we replace the second term in the left - hand side of with eq .  .",
    "next , to keep the number of independent parameters to an absolute minimum , we assume a simple linear dependence of the coordination number : @xmath89 . in this way",
    ", the critical volume fraction is uniquely identified by @xmath90 , as can be verified by using eq .  .",
    "finally , to recover the correct exponent in the percolating regime , we follow the phenomenological approach of ref .   and replace the quantity @xmath91 in eq .   with @xmath92 , where we set @xmath86 for three dimensional materials .",
    "the resulting ema equation reduces thus to : @xmath93 ^ 3 - 1\\right\\}=1.\\ ] ] it is easy to see from the above equation that for @xmath94 the ema conductance reduces to eq .  , while for @xmath95 ( and for sufficiently small @xmath82 ) it takes the percolation form @xmath96 .",
    "it is worth stressing that while the tunneling contribution is treated explicitly , the percolation threshold is used as a parameter of the theory , with no explicit relation with the specific microstructure . in this respect ,",
