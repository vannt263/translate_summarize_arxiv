    "the fermionic part of the action is the usual staggered action with @xmath12 and @xmath13 set to zero for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and to their boundary values at the boundaries @xcite .",

    "the normalization @xmath24 has been chosen such that @xmath25 equals the bare coupling at tree  level without any cutoff effects .",
    "the one  loop contribution from the staggered fermions to the coupling constant , @xmath26 , comes from the derivative of the fermion fluctuation determinant @xmath27 here @xmath28 for one flavor of staggered fermions , since they correspond to four flavors of continuum fermions .",
