    "observations of high - redshift quasars indicate that supermassive black holes ( smbhs for central black holes , as in greene ( 2012 ) . ] ) are already present in the early universe ( e.g. , vestergaard & osmer 2009 ; willott et al .",

    "however , the unresolved cosmic background implies smbhs are not common ( or else are generally quasi - quiescent ) in high - redshift galaxies ( salvaterra et al .",

    "is not yet conclusively established ( see reviews by volonteri 2012 ; volonteri & bellovary 2012 ; natarajan 2014 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the evolution of smbhs appears to be entwined with that of their host galaxies .",
    "this is suggested by the @xmath12 relation linking the central black hole mass to the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , which holds for both quiescent spheroids ( gltekin et al .",

    "both the mass distribution and the very rate of occurance of smbhs in lower - mass galaxies contain archaeological information on the initial seed formation mechanism .",
    "a robust conclusion from semi - analytical modeling is that smaller galaxies are more likely to contain smbhs when pop  iii remnants , rather than direct gas collapse , provide the dominant seeding mode ( volonteri & natarajan 2009 ; volonteri 2010 ; van wassenhove et al .",
    "this is because cold low - metallicity gas is only able to collapse to a central massive object in halos with low spin parameter , otherwise disk fragmentation leads to star formation ( van wassenhove et al .",

    "measurement of the occupation fraction ( i.e. , the percentage of galaxies hosting smbhs ) in nearby galaxies , particularly at low stellar masses @xmath14 , is an effective _ observational _ discriminator between light versus heavy seeds ( greene 2012 ) .",
    "the limited @xmath1510@xmath16 yr lifetime of luminous quasars suggests ( soltan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) , consistent with observations , that the most massive `` inactive '' galaxies invariably host smbhs now accreting / radiating only at @xmath17 eddington , but the occupation fraction in lower mass galaxies remains uncertain .",
    "clearly some low - mass galaxies do possess smbhs , even active ones .",

    "2011 ) , and features central blue clumps of star - formation within a red early - type system ( nguyen et al .  2014 ) .",

    "for each example of a low - mass galaxy that has observational evidence for a central smbh , there are 10100 similar galaxies for which the presence or absence of a black hole is currently impossible to measure . however , dynamical mass constraints are quite stringent for some local group objects ( the spiral m33 : gebhardt et al .  2001 ; merritt et al .",

    "high spatial resolution observations can efficiently identify very low - level smbh activity ( soria et al .",
    "2006 ; pellegrini 2010 ) without contamination from the stellar emission that dilutes optical searches .",
    "nuclear emission directly measures high - energy accretion - linked radiative output and additionally serves as a plausible proxy for mechanical feedback ( allen et al .",
    "2006 ; balmaverde et al .",
    "studies of low - level smbh activity are best conducted on galaxies with low star formation rates to eliminate potential contamination from high - mass binaries .",
    "for statistical purposes the sample must span a wide range in @xmath2 and be unbiased with respect to optical or nuclear properties .",
    "these criteria are satisfied by the amuse - virgo ( gallo et al .  2008 , 2010 ;",
    "g08 , g10 hearafter ) and amuse - field ( miller et al .",
    "2012a , 2012b ; m12a , m12b hereafter ) surveys , which are large _ chandra _ programs that together targeted 203 optically - selected early - type galaxies at @xmath24  mpc , and now include _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ , and _ vla / jvla _ coverage .",
    "almost all of these galaxies have @xmath25  erg  s@xmath21 and @xmath26 , below limits commonly used to distinguish active galactic nuclei ( agn ) from `` inactive '' galaxies .    in this work we use the amuse dataset to obtain the first simultaneous constraints upon the scaling of nuclear activity with host galaxy stellar mass and the local supermassive black hole occupation fraction , and",
    "derive guidelines for the precision that may be achieved with a larger sample or a next - generation telescope .",
    "the amuse nuclear detection fractions constitute , after correcting for potential minor low - mass binary contamination ( g08 ; g10 ; m12a ) , strict lower limits on the occupation fraction . taking as given that all higher - mass early - type galaxies host smbhs , the efficiency with which their nuclear sources are found suggests a correction factor to apply to the lower - mass galaxies . after assuming a uniform distribution of eddington - scaled luminosity",
    ", the occupation fraction can be calculated in a straightforward fashion by imposing a limiting eddington sensitivity threshold .",
    "this approach tentatively favors heavy seeds ( greene 2012 ) .    however , the assumption of a mass - independent eddington ratio distribution is disfavored by the data . both the virgo and field galaxies display an apparent `` downsizing '' trend ( with a consistent slope ) toward relatively greater eddington - scaled luminosity in lower - mass galaxies or for inferred lower - mass smbhs ( g10 ; m12a ; m12b ) .",
    "while this downsizing tendency is qualitatively similar to the effect found at higher masses and accretion rates for quasars , the physical explanation may be completely distinct , given the very low accretion rates and radiative efficiencies that characterize the amuse sample ( including m  87 , which has a mass accretion rate directly constrained by the rotation measure to be two orders of magnitude below bondi ; kuo et al .",
    "thus , we can not make direct comparisons with recent results questioning downsizing in moderately luminous agn with @xmath27 ( aird et al .",
    "in general , the presence of both downsizing and occupation fraction complicates estimates of either parameter alone .",
    "for example , a downsizing - enhanced detectability of smbhs down the mass scale could bias high an estimate of the occupation fraction that presumes a uniform eddington fraction .",
    "the slope of the dependence of @xmath1 upon @xmath2 is primarily sensitive to the higher mass galaxies , most of which are detected , but could potentially be influenced by partial occupation in lower mass galaxies .",
    "to date occupation fraction and downsizing have not been simultaneously constrained .    to investigate the occupation fraction of smbhs and simultaneously their eddington rates across the mass scale , we consider the measurable distribution of luminosities as a function of host galaxy stellar mass",
    ". motivated by prior studies we take @xmath5 to be a linear function of @xmath6 but allow for significant intrinsic scatter ; see figure  1a .",
    "it is assumed that the degree of intrinsic scatter remains constant across the mass scale and we note as a caveat that this is observationally uncertain .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2 correlation is observationally truncated by the sensitivity limit of the amuse surveys , which is @xmath28  erg  s@xmath21 .",
    "a decreasing occupation fraction toward lower @xmath2 would result in a portion of galaxies not following the @xmath1@xmath29 correlation but presenting instead as non - detections , since they would lack an smbh to generate emission .",
    "we consider occupation fractions bounded by @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the probability of hosting an smbh is taken to be @xmath34 this simple functional form was selected because it is smooth and spans a wide range of plausible possibilities , and in particular includes both the light `` stellar death '' and the heavy `` direct collapse '' competing seed formation models ( from van wassenhove et al .  2010 ; volonteri 2010 ) as illustrated in greene  ( 2012 ; see their figure  2 ) .",
    "we show this parameterization in figure  1 for @xmath35 , which correspond to occupation fractions between 98% and 2% for galaxies with @xmath36 .",
    "note that here and throughout occupation fractions are derived from a given @xmath37 value by applying the probabilities in figure  1b to the amuse @xmath2 distribution in figure  1c , and that by construction even models with a low occupation fraction ( always quoted , we emphasize , for galaxies with @xmath38 ) produce nearly 100% smbh occupation in high - mass galaxies .",
    "the relationships we assume throughout between @xmath2 , @xmath39 , and the smbh occupation fraction are illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the simulated sample of 10000 galaxies ( the colored points in the top panel ) has @xmath2 drawn from an unevenly - weighted sum of four gaussians constructed to empirically match the mass distribution of the amuse surveys .",
    "values , standard deviations , and fractional weights for the four gaussians are ( 7.9 , 9.2 , 10.3 , 11.0 ) , ( 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.5 ) , and ( 0.10 , 0.43 , 0.20 , 0.27 ) , respectively ; the ks - test agreement with the full amuse distribution is @xmath40 . ] the expected nuclear luminosities where an smbh is present are calculated from the @xmath1@xmath2 correlation , here given by the best - fit model to the full amuse sample ( the solid black trend line ) , but with significant intrinsic scatter to match that observed .",
    "next , each of the simulated galaxies is assigned an smbh based on the choice of @xmath37 ; i.e. , the high @xmath37 red curve in panel ( b ) populates only the high mass galaxies shown by the red points in panel ( a ) , whereas the intermediate @xmath37 blue curve populates the high mass galaxies down to the intermediate mass galaxies shown by the red through blue points , and finally the low @xmath37 green curve populates nearly all galaxies down to dwarfs shown by the red through green points .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the total simulated @xmath2 distribution , which by construction matches the amuse sample , and uses the same color coding to illustrate the progression in occupation fraction as parameterized by @xmath41 .",
    "the conversion from simulated to observed @xmath1 then results from imposing a sensitivity threshold , such as the horizontal dotted black line in panel ( a ) from amuse , and changing @xmath1 to an upper limit ( with a value narrowly scattered around the threshold ) for all galaxies that either lack an smbh or else have an smbh emitting below the detection sensitivity .",
    "we modified the bayesian linear regression code of kelly ( 2007 ) to fit for the smbh occupation fraction ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) while simultaneously determining @xmath1 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the primary difference between the model of kelly ( 2007 ) and our extension is that the method of kelly ( 2007 ) would model the distribution of @xmath42 at fixed @xmath2 as a single normal distribution , whereas we here model the distribution of @xmath43 as a mixture of a normal distribuiton and a delta function centered at an extremely small value of @xmath42 , with the mixing weights as a function of @xmath2 given by the occupation fraction at that @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , we assume @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes a normal distribution with mean @xmath46 and variance @xmath47 as a function of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath47 denote the intercept , slope , and variance in the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath50@xmath51 relationship , and @xmath52 is the dirac delta function .    in order to obtain samples of @xmath53 and @xmath47 from their posterior distribution",

    "is considered known , while for those with upper limits @xmath54 is unknown . for those sources with unknown @xmath54 we update their values of @xmath54 at each stage of the gibbs sampler by drawing from a bernoulli distribution with probability @xmath58^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution .",
    "given these new values of @xmath54 we can then update @xmath60 using a metropolis update in combination with the conditional posterior @xmath61^{i_i } [ 1 - f_{\\rm occ}(m_{\\rm      star,0})]^{1-i_i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rest of the gibbs sampler proceeds as in kelly ( 2007 ) .    the parameter @xmath62 is restricted to be greater than 7.5 since any values below 7.5 already produce near 100% occupation fraction . as with the original linmix_err idl",
    "routine , measurement errors , intrinsic scatter , and upper limits are incorporated , and the independent variable distribution is approximated as a sum of gaussians .",
    "the four parameters of interest in our model are the intercept , slope , and intrinsic scatter of the @xmath63 relation as well as @xmath62 , which gives the occupation fraction for galaxies below @xmath64 .",
    "the best - fit preferred parameter values are taken as the median of 5000 ( thinned from 50000 , retaining every tenth ) draws from the posterior distribution and quoted errors correspond to 1@xmath7 uncertainties .",

    "sources are point - like and located at the projected optical center of their galaxy , to within the optical and astrometric and centroid uncertainties .",
    "we determine more precise stellar masses for some of the amuse galaxies using archival and newly obtained _ hst _ data , including cycle 19 two - color _ hst _ acs imaging of field galaxies ( baldassare et al .  2014 ; b14 hereafter ) .",
    "two field galaxies , ngc 3928 ( described as a starburst by carollo et al .  1997 ) and ngc 3265 , show spiral arms in _ hst _ imaging and are removed .",
    "we also cautiously choose to set aside vcc 1857 and vcc 1828 from the virgo sample , as these two galaxies have irregular and late types , respectively , in hyperleda despite their arguably elliptical appearance .",
    "the `` full '' amuse sample then consists of 197 early - type galaxies of which 81 ( or 41% ) have detections .",
    "the distances to the virgo galaxies were assumed as 16.4 mpc in g10 and the distances to the field galaxies were calculated from their redshifts in m12a .",
    "we here ( and in b14 ) make use of slightly more accurate distances , specifically taking distances to virgo galaxies from mei et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and distances to field galaxies from non - redshift measurements given in hyperleda where available .",
    "the stellar masses and x - ray luminosities are adjusted from g10 and m12a using these more accurate distances ( with _",
    "hst_-derived @xmath29 values for some field galaxies taken from b14 ) ; the resulting full",
    "amuse virgo and field combined sample properties are given in table  1 .",
    "while the properties for several individual galaxies are improved in accuracy , this adjustment has only a tiny statistical impact on the overall sample , with a median change to @xmath2 and @xmath1 of 0.02 dex ( standard deviation of 0.11 dex ) .",
    "we next generate a `` clean '' sample by removing three galaxies for which optical or uv _ hst _ imaging shows irregular or clumpy morphology and colors suggestive of recent ( @xmath65100 - 300  myr ) star formation . from the field sample ,",
    "ngc  855 and eso  540@xmath66014 display clumpy structure with blue colors ( a spectrum of the latter indicates high star - formation rates rather than the literature seyfert 2 classification ; amy reines , private communication ) . from the virgo sample ,",
    "vcc 1499 has archival _ hst _ uv imaging that is suggestive of galaxy - wide star - formation , and it is identified as post - starburst by gavazzi et al .",
    "these three galaxies all have detectable nuclear emission , but their optical morphologies and blue colors indicate contamination from high - mass binaries is possible .",
    "the clean sample then contains 194 galaxies of which 78 have detections .",
    "finally , we generate a `` safe '' sample by correcting for potential contamination of the nuclear emission due to low - mass binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the probability of contamination of the nuclear x - ray emission from lmxbs enclosed by the projected _ chandra _ point spread function , within the @xmath24  mpc volume - limited amuse sample , is generally negligible for non - nucleated galaxies ( see g10 for details ; for context , @xmath67 corresponds to projected 50/100/150  pc at distances of 10/20/30  mpc ) . for galaxies hosting a nuclear star cluster ,",
    "the probability of contamination is greater and is conservatively estimated using a globular cluster luminosity function ( g10 ; b14 ) . taking into account the measured nuclear luminosities , the probability of lmxb contamination is @xmath6850% in four virgo galaxies ( vcc  1883 , vcc  784 , vcc  1250 , and vcc 1283 have contamination probabilities of 100% , 51% , 100% , and 45% ; g10 ) . from the _ hst_-covered field sample ngc  3384 ,",
    "ngc  1172 , and ngc  2970 have non - negligible contamination probabilities ( b14 ) ; ngc  3384 is known from stellar dynamics to have an smbh with a mass of @xmath01.8@xmath69 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) so we flag ngc  1172 and ngc  2970 .",
    "ngc 1331 is the only additional field galaxy known to have both a nsc and a central x - ray source , but it has a @xmath655% probability of lmxb contamination . from among the field galaxies that have a detected nuclear source but lack _ hst _ coverage , about three more are statistically expected to contain nuclear star clusters that could generate lmxb contamination .",
    "an example is ngc  3522 with @xmath70 and a moderate @xmath71 , and we randomly chose two others from ngc  2778 , ngc  3457 , ngc  3641 , ngc  4283 , ngc  1370 , or pgc  1206166 in four ways , producing four slightly different versions of a safe sample .",
    "the luminosities for the nine flagged galaxies are converted to limits for the safe sample , which then still contains 194 galaxies but with 69 now considered to be detections .",
    "the four slightly different versions of the safe sample produce formally consistent fitting results , although the median occupation fraction is lower if pgc  1206166 with @xmath72 is considered contaminated ( illustrating the importance of every x - ray detection in the dwarf galaxy regime ) .",
    "the safe sample provides a deliberately cautious approach to lmxb contamination .",
    "both the virgo and field samples include several galaxies with nuclear star clusters that are not detected in ; for example , from the field ngc  1340 and ngc  1426 have calculated probabilities of @xmath010% for having a central lmxb with @xmath1 greater than the amuse sensitivity . because the probability of hosting a nuclear star cluster increases to lower stellar mass ( as does the profile cuspiness , centrally partially offsetting the absolute decrease in @xmath2 ) , the potentially contaminated galaxies all have @xmath73 .",
    "( the field sample has relatively more low - mass galaxies , nucleated galaxies , and potentially contaminated galaxies , but the frequency of nuclear star clusters after accounting for stellar mass is similar to that in virgo ; b14 ) .",
    "the impact of conservatively correcting for lmxb contamination is to reduce slightly the inferred occupation fraction and to increase slightly the slope .",
    "the most accurate representation of the amuse dataset likely lies between the clean and safe samples , probably closer to the former given the conservative lmxb correction .",
    "a low percentage of detections in low - mass galaxies arises from some combination of a low occupation fraction , a steep @xmath63 slope , and small intrinsic scatter . for the amuse sample ,",
    "the overall detection fraction is 41% ( 36% after accounting for potential lmxb contamination ) ; most of these detections ( 84% , or slightly higher after lxmb correction ) are in galaxies with @xmath74 , and only 12% of galaxies with",
    "@xmath75 have nuclear detections . for illustration",
    ", similar distributions can be produced for slopes of 1.0 with occupation fractions between 50% and 100% and intrinsic scatter of 0.7 dex , or for slopes of 0.7 with 50% occupation fraction and intrinsic scatter of 0.5 dex .",
    "however , flatter slopes @xmath76 that match the overall detection fraction necessarily overpredict the proportion of detections in low - mass galaxies , and occupation fractions of @xmath6520% underpredict that same ratio .",

    "the slope has a negligible ( @xmath150.05 ) probability of being @xmath650.5 or @xmath41.0 .",

    "figure  2 , bottom , shows the 1@xmath7 confidence region for the occupation probability as a function of @xmath2 , along with the lower limits provided by the x - ray active fraction .",
    "the significant uncertainties prevent a definitive discrimination between formation mechanisms .",
    "the preferred @xmath63 slope of @xmath00.70.8 for the full or clean amuse samples supports downsizing in these weakly accreting smbhs , albeit with respect to @xmath2 rather than inferred @xmath82 as given in g10 and m12b .",
    "( we used simulations to confirm that an input universal eddington ratio distribution would produce preferred slopes @xmath83 with our methodology . )",
    "while dynamical measurements of @xmath82 in these galaxies are not available , a typical scaling of @xmath84 ( hring & rix  2004 ) would suggests this downsizing effect is similar or perhaps slightly more pronounced with black hole mass rather than host galaxy stellar mass . ;",

    "to assess prospects for improving constraints upon the occupation fraction with future surveys , we use the bayesian linear regression fitting to investigate the impact of the limiting sensitivity and the sample size upon the parameter errors .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 versus @xmath2 is only subtly changed by partial occupation fraction for the amuse sensitivity limit ( figure  3 , right column ) , because most of the impacted low - mass galaxies would already have x - ray luminosities precluding detection . to examine the impact of the sensitivity limit ( as well as to validate our modeling techniques )",

    "we verified that arbitrary input parameters are cleanly recovered ( with correct statistical uncertainties ) in simulations given an artificially increased sensitivity of @xmath89  erg  s@xmath21 .",
    "recall that for these simulations @xmath2 values are drawn from a sum of four gaussians which empirically matches the amuse distribution , @xmath1 is computed from @xmath2 for a given correlation , and then the occupation fraction is enforced following the probability curve for a given @xmath37 value ( figure  1b ) and objects then lacking an smbh are mandated to be upper limits .",
    "some examples of fitting these simulations are provided in figure  4 for input slopes of 0.4 , 0.7 , and 1.0 and occupation fractions of 15% , 50% , and 85% .",
    "the sample size was fixed to 200 objects , and the simulated points were varied by an intrinsic @xmath63 scatter of 0.7 dex for 100 realizations of each model .",
    "the resulting uncertainties on both parameters are modest even with only 200 points ( and consistent with the output errors from the code ) .",
    "unfortunately , even the outstanding _ chandra _ psf is not sufficient to overcome the rapid rise in the luminosity function of low - mass binaries and so contamination becomes impossible to avoid below the amuse sensitivity limit of @xmath90  erg  s@xmath21 . with higher spatial resolution the total projected stellar mass enclosed in an extraction aperture , and correspondingly the likelihood of contamination , could be decreased . to achieve a 20@xmath91 improvement in sensitivity down to @xmath92  erg  s@xmath21 , for galaxies of stellar mass @xmath93 lying within 30 mpc ( with effective radii of @xmath94 ) a resolution of @xmath95 would be necessary to limit potential contamination to @xmath96% in a given nuclear detection .",
    "the inclusion of x - ray variability or spectral measurements ( or other activity indicators , such as radio emission ) could weaken this requirement .    the impact of increasing the sample size is also shown in figure  4 , for @xmath97  erg  s@xmath21 as for the amuse dataset .",
    "for these simulations new objects are added at the amuse @xmath2 distribution probabilities but weighted by a factor of two for @xmath98 ; the uncertainties on the occupation fraction converge more quickly when smaller galaxies are preferentially targeted . with only 600 total objects , the statistical errors on the occupation fraction permit clean differentiation between full and half occupation , and with 1500 objects",
    "the occupation can be fixed to @xmath7715% .",
    "if the slope or intrinsic scatter were known ( for example , from theoretical arguments ) rather than fit , far fewer objects would be required to obtain such constraints .",
    "there are good prospects for combining the amuse samples with new coverage ( e.g. , of the outer fornax cluster ) , or with archival coverage of low - mass galaxies serendipitously present in existing very deep _ chandra _ observations of m87 in virgo or 3c  84 in perseus . here",
    "ultra - compact dwarf galaxies , which may contain smbhs and have undergone tidal stripping ( mieske et al .",
    "2013 ; seth et al .",
    "2014 ) , could be included .",
    "our simultaneous fitting of the smbh occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear luminosity with stellar mass constrains smbhs to be present in @xmath420% of early - type galaxies with @xmath3 and suggests the dependence of @xmath5 upon @xmath6 has a slope of @xmath00.70.8 .",
    "this work provides promising if inconclusive information on the local smbh occupation fraction and also supports a downsizing trend in low - level smbh activity .    the highly sub - eddington objects that make up the amuse dataset are expected to feature radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) .",
    "bondi accretion of even the limited gas provided by stellar winds ( volonteri et al .",
    "2011 ) near the nuclei of early - type galaxies would predict greater luminosities than observed ; the efficiency as well as the accretion rate must be low in these objects ( soria et al .  2006 ; ho 2009 ) .",
    "either an advection - dominated accretion flow ( e.g. , di matteo & fabian 1997 ; narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) or an outflow / jet component ( e.g. , soria et al .  2006 ; plotkin et al .",
    "2012 ) is required .",
    "in general , the efficiency in these hot flows is theoretically expected to decrease toward lower accretion rates ( yuan & narayan 2014 and references therein ) .",
    "although the bondi radius is directly resolved by chandra in deep observations of ngc  3115 , the temperature profile is inconsistent with simple riaf models ( wong et al .",
    "fueling of a riaf by steady - state stellar winds may be supplemented by intermittent processes such as tidal disruption , or by gradual stripping of central stars ( e.g. , macleod et al .",
    "2013 ) . while we can not constrain the physical mechanism responsible for the observed emission ,",
    "the simplest explanation for downsizing in low - level smbh activity would be that the relative rate of accretion is higher in smaller galaxies , with a fixed low efficiency .",
    "we reiterate that the downsizing we identify here is restricted to low - level smbh activity and may not apply to agns .",
    "the methodology we use here is flexible and could also be applied to deep surveys of agn .",
    "for example , the 4  ms cdfs contains active galactic nuclei including to relatively modest @xmath99 ( schramm & silverman 2013 ; schramm et al .",
    "2013 ) and at low levels of activity ( young et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as normal galaxies at cosmological distances ( lehmer et al .",
    "2012 ) , and opens substantial additional volume albeit at lower sensitivity .",
    "we provide an illustration of applying this general technique to simulated deep field galaxies in figure  5 , and are pursuing this approach in greene et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    in this higher @xmath1 regime",
    "we populate x - ray luminosities drawing from a uniform eddington ratio distribution with a power - law slope of @xmath100 as in aird et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , assuming @xmath101 . for a hypothetical combined cdfs+cdfn+aegisxd sample with a typical detection sensitivity of @xmath102 out to @xmath103",
    ", we expect about 15000 @xmath103 galaxies ( estimated from cardamone et al .",
    "2010 ; xue et al .",
    "2010 ) of which @xmath0300 or 2% should host agns ( estimated from xue et al .  2010 , 2011 ;",
    "lehmer et al .",
    "we confirmed with an artificially large sample that the distribution of detections ( color gradients in figure  5 ) can be used to infer the occupation fraction .",
    "for example , the percentages of agns in hosts with @xmath104 is 11.9% with full occupation versus 6.1% with half occupation .",
    "this is statistically distinguishable at 99% confidence for the expected @xmath105300 agns ( black crosses in figure  5 ) if the other model parameters are known or fixed by theory ; full versus half occupation predicts 37 versus 17 agns in hosts with @xmath106 ) .",
    "this test will increase in power with the upcoming deeper cdfs exposure .",
    "we are also refining our measurement of occupation fraction within the amuse sample through incorporating the influence of large - scale environment upon low - level smbh activity .",
    "the scaled nuclear luminosities of early - type galaxies apparently decrease from isolated to group to cluster environments ( m12a , b ) . this may reflect greater quantities of cold gas in field galaxies ( e.g. , oosterloo et al .",
    "2010 ) , for example due to reduced stripping relative to their cluster counterparts .",
    "cold accretion has been inferred to be relevant to low - level smbh activity from studies of brightest cluster galaxies ( russell et al .",
    "2013 ) and dust ( martini et al .",
    "2013 ) , and agns preferentially inhabit gas - rich galaxies ( vito et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the recent tentative finding that nuclear star clusters in massive early type galaxies are bluer in the field ( b14 ) implies that field nuclear star clusters formed at lower metallicities and/or experienced more recent star formation , relative to cluster counterparts ; this in turn suggests that cold gas can eventually filter down to the central regions where it is available ( either directly or via enhanced star formation and stellar winds ) to be heated and inefficiently accreted onto the central smbh .",
    "we are continuing to investigate the impact of mpc - scale densities using new _",
    "chandra _ observations of early - type galaxies located within cosmic voids .",
    "however , the analysis presented here is not biased because the slopes of the @xmath107 relation are consistent between the amuse - field and amuse - virgo samples ( m12b ) ; instead , the uncertainties are potentially slightly inflated .",
    "including any environmental dependence , once quantified at high significance , will helpfully decrease the scatter in the @xmath63 relation in the combined amuse dataset .",
    "additional multiwavelength information will provide better understanding of both individual objects and of the overall population ( e.g. , the distribution of galaxies showing radio , or optical , indications of nuclear activity ; reines et al .",
    "new dynamical mass measurements with a 30 m class telescope would help clarify the mass distribution of smbhs in smaller galaxies , providing a complementary probe of black hole birth and growth ( van wassenhove et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this context",
    "it is interesting that no galaxies with @xmath3 ( without stripping ; seth et al .",
    "2014 ) are yet known with confirmed @xmath108 .",
    "tidal disruption transients , particularly from white dwarfs , can provide complementary insight into lower - mass smbhs ( clausen & eracleous 2011 ; macleod et al .",
    "pairing observational advances with increasingly sophisticated theoretical models will help discriminate between models of seed formation .",
