    "our experiments require to tune the pump frequency with sub - kilohertz resolution across the resonance frequency of the tem@xmath23-mode interacting with the bec .",

    ", the linear @xmath174-polarization of the pump beam may be decomposed into equally strong left and right circular components with respect to the @xmath9-axis .",
    "only the left circular component can scatter into the left circularly polarized cavity mode .",
    "hence , the light shift @xmath35 induced by the pump beam in the experiment is related to the number of pump photons @xmath175 used in the model description by @xmath176 and thus @xmath177 .",
    "a more involved description , which is deferred to forthcoming work , should account for two orthogonal polarization modes of the cavity operating with different effective detunings .",

    "it is interesting to note the asymmetry with respect to the @xmath44 line , which is also observed in the experiment .",
    "it arises due to the interaction between the matter modes @xmath178 and @xmath179 mediated via their interaction with the intra - cavity mode @xmath157 .",
    "the matter mode @xmath179 can not be directly populated by the pump beam via scattering by a condensate atom , because pump photons can only transfer momentum into the @xmath8 but not the @xmath180-direction .",
    "population of @xmath179 can only arise , if a photon scattered into the cavity is re - scattered back into the pump beam before it is lost through a cavity mirror .",
    "in fact , if these processes are neglected by setting @xmath179 to zero , an instability boundary is calculated , which is perfectly mirror symmetric with respect to the @xmath44 line .",
    "figure 2(c ) in the main text was obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mean_field_equations ] ) for a linear ramp of @xmath35 with 2 ms duration including all modes with @xmath181 .",
    "a small initial deviation from @xmath182 is required in order to leave the unstable zero solution . in the experiment ,",
    "this deviation is naturally provided by thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "we assumed that the first excited modes @xmath62 are populated according to a boltzman factor with a temperature @xmath183 ( @xmath184 critical temperature of the bec ) .",
    "hence , we set @xmath185 and @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "we have checked that the gross structure of the solution does not depend on the exact choice of the temperature .",
    "the agreement with the observation in figure 2(a ) is qualitative .",
    "the calculated maximal photon numbers notably exceed the measured values , while the calculated superradiant light pulses are shorter than their observed counterparts .",
    "the former may reflect our unreliable knowledge of the outcoupling mirror transmission .",
    "the quantitative discrepancies may also result from simplifications made in our model .",
    "a more realistic calculation should include both available circularly polarized intra - cavity modes , which are coupled to the incident linearly polarized pump photons with different strength and effective resonance frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the finite size of the pump beam should be accounted for , the radius of which is only a factor 2.5 larger than the radius of the bec such that atoms at the edge of the bec experience decreased values of @xmath35 .",
    "finite size effects leading to a mie - scattering scenario may also be significant @xcite .",
    "another important issue in our experiment is collisional interaction , since due to the tight external trap the particle densities are well above @xmath188@xmath189 .",
    "this leads to significant populations in a continuum of collision states , which decreases the number of atoms contributing to superradiant scattering ."

    "<S> in ( a ) the intra - cavity intensity displays a single sharp superradiant spike , during which the bec is completely transferred to the @xmath45 momentum state as is illustrated by the momentum spectra shown in the insets . </S>",
    "<S> conservation of energy requires @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , with @xmath52khz the frequency of the scattered light @xmath40 deviates from the effective cavity resonance frequency @xmath74 by @xmath75 , i.e. , the scattering processes @xmath76 ( red arrows in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup](b ) ) are detuned from resonance . </S>",
    "<S> other processes , however , are far more off - resonant : for a subsequent transfer to @xmath47 , requiring @xmath77 ( blue arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](b ) ) , the detuning is @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , after complete transfer to @xmath79 , scattering is blocked although the pump strength is further increased .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation essentially changes , in the blue detuned case ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath80 for processes transferring 2 , 6 , or 10 @xmath57 to the atoms ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> red , blue , and green arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](b ) ) are @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the transitions @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 energy transfer are significantly slower than the nearly resonant processes , connecting to the @xmath79 and @xmath85 modes by transferring @xmath86 to the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the experiment , first an increase of the intra - cavity intensity is seen ( region highlighted by red background in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transfer](b ) , indicated by ( i ) ) , which results from scattering atoms from the condensate mode @xmath87 into the @xmath88 and @xmath89 modes . </S>",
    "<S> once these modes become populated , the much faster nearly resonant processes with @xmath86 energy transfer set in ( region highlighted in blue , ( ii ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting rapid depletion of the @xmath85 modes degrades the matter grating required to sustain the collective character of the @xmath90 transition , which is therefore suppressed such that significant population can remain in the condensate mode as is seen in the inset ( 4 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transfer](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression of superradiant scattering is related to the mechanism of subradiance in the dicke model of spontaneous emitters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the region highlighted in green and labeled ( iii ) , the comparatively weaker processes , associated with @xmath91 energy transfer , populate an additional shell of momentum states , resulting in the small intra - cavity intensity level past @xmath92ms . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer of 14 @xmath57 would correspond to @xmath93 , with the consequence that such processes are practically suppressed . as the insets in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transfer](b ) show , only momentum states @xmath94 become populated , which require at most @xmath95 kinetic energy transfer per scattering event , i.e. , @xmath96 with the constraint @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings demonstrate that the modification of the electromagnetic vacuum with a narrow band optical cavity provides control of the available momentum channels of superradiant rayleigh scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this may , for example , be used to decelerate an initially moving bec by a series of pump pulses with appropriately adjusted frequencies and intensities . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : deceleration ] a bec , initially prepared in the @xmath98 momentum state , is decelerated by two successive pump pulses : a first @xmath67s long pulse with @xmath69khz , @xmath99 followed by a second pulse with @xmath70khz , @xmath100 and @xmath68s duration . </S>",
    "<S> the insets depicting momentum spectra at different times during the pulse sequence show that the initial bec after 0.5 ms is transferred to zero momentum . note that due to collisions a significant amount of atoms is dispersed among a continuum of scattering states leading to the diffuse grey background . by adding additional pulses this scheme may be readily extended for deceleration of much faster particle samples . </S>",
    "<S> other pulse sequences may be designed to implement efficient matter wave beam splitters or multiple path matter wave interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting future perspective of our work is the search for quantum entanglement between light and matter observables @xcite .    </S>",
