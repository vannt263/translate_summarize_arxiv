    "in a sequential decision problem , a decision maker ( or forecaster ) performs a sequence of actions . after each action",
    "the decision maker suffers some loss , depending on the response ( or state ) of the environment , and its goal is to minimize its cumulative loss over a certain period of time . in the setting",
    "considered here , no probabilistic assumption is made on how the losses corresponding to different actions are generated .",
    "in particular , the losses may depend on the previous actions of the decision maker , whose goal is to perform well relative to a set of reference forecasters ( the so - called `` experts '' ) for any possible behavior of the environment .",
    "more precisely , the aim of the decision maker is to achieve asymptotically the same average ( per round ) loss as the best expert .",
    "research into this problem started in the 1950s ( see , for example , blackwell @xcite and hannan @xcite for some of the basic results ) and gained new life in the 1990s following the work of vovk @xcite , littlestone and warmuth @xcite , and cesa - bianchi _",
    "et al@xmath3 _ @xcite .",
    "these results show that for any bounded loss function , if the decision maker has access to the past losses of all experts , then it is possible to construct on - line algorithms that perform , for any possible behavior of the environment , almost as well as the best of @xmath4 experts . more precisely , the per round cumulative loss of these algorithms is at most as large as that of the best expert plus a quantity proportional to @xmath5 for any bounded loss function , where @xmath0 is the number of rounds in the decision game .",
    "the logarithmic dependence on the number of experts makes it possible to obtain meaningful bounds even if the pool of experts is very large .    in certain situations",
    "the decision maker has only limited knowledge about the losses of all possible actions .",
    "for example , it is often natural to assume that the decision maker gets to know only the loss corresponding to the action it has made , and has no information about the loss it would have suffered had it made a different decision .",
    "this setup is referred to as the _ multi - armed bandit problem _ , and was considered , in the adversarial setting , by auer _",
    "et al@xmath3 _",
    "@xcite who gave an algorithm whose normalized regret ( the difference of the algorithm s average loss and that of the best expert ) is upper bounded by a quantity which is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "note that , compared to the _ full information _ case described above where the losses of all possible actions are revealed to the decision maker , there is an extra @xmath7 factor in the performance bound , which seriously limits the usefulness of the bound if the number of experts is large .",
    "another interesting example for the limited information case is the so - called _ label efficient decision problem _ ( see helmbold and panizza @xcite ) in which it is too costly to observe the state of the environment , and so the decision maker can query the losses of all possible actions for only a limited number of times . a recent result of cesa - bianchi , lugosi , and stoltz @xcite shows that in this case , if the decision maker can query the losses @xmath8 times during a period of length @xmath0 , then it can achieve @xmath9 average excess loss relative to the best expert .    in many applications",
    "the set of experts has a certain structure that may be exploited to construct efficient on - line decision algorithms .",
    "the construction of such algorithms has been of great interest in computational learning theory .",

    "in this paper we study the on - line shortest path problem , a representative example of structured expert classes that has received attention in the literature for its many applications , including , among others , routing in communication networks ; see , e.g. , takimoto and warmuth @xcite , awerbuch _ et al_.@xcite , or gyrgy and ottucsk @xcite , and adaptive quantizer design in zero - delay lossy source coding ; see , gyrgy _",
    "et al@xmath3 _  @xcite . in this problem ,",
    "a weighted directed ( acyclic ) graph is given whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary manner , and the decision maker has to pick in each round a path between two given vertices , such that the weight of this path ( the sum of the weights of its composing edges ) be as small as possible .",
    "efficient solutions , with time and space complexity proportional to the number of edges rather than to the number of paths ( the latter typically being exponential in the number of edges ) , have been given in the full information case , where in each round the weights of all the edges are revealed after a path has been chosen ; see , for example , mohri @xcite , takimoto and warmuth @xcite , kalai and vempala @xcite , and gyrgy _",
    "et al@xmath3 _  @xcite .    in the bandit setting only the weights of the edges or just the sum of the weights of the edges composing the chosen path are revealed to the decision maker . if one applies the general bandit algorithm of auer _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the resulting bound will be too large to be of practical use because of its square - root - type dependence on the number of paths @xmath4 . on the other hand , using the special graph structure in the problem , awerbuch and kleinberg @xcite and mcmahan and blum @xcite managed to get rid of the exponential dependence on the number of edges in the performance bound .",
    "they achieved this by extending the exponentially weighted average predictor and the follow - the - perturbed - leader algorithm of hannan @xcite to the generalization of the multi - armed bandit setting for shortest paths , when only the sum of the weights of the edges is available for the algorithm .",
    "however , the dependence of the bounds obtained in @xcite and @xcite on the number of rounds @xmath0 is significantly worse than the @xmath10 bound of auer _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "awerbuch and kleinberg @xcite consider the model of `` non - oblivious '' adversaries for shortest path ( i.e. , the losses assigned to the edges can depend on the previous actions of the forecaster ) and prove an @xmath11 bound for the expected per - round regret .",
    "mcmahan and blum @xcite give a simpler algorithm than in @xcite however obtain a bound of the order of @xmath12 for the expected regret .",
    "in this paper we provide an extension of the bandit algorithm of auer _",
    "et al_.   @xcite unifying the advantages of the above approaches , with a performance bound that is polynomial in the number of edges , and converges to zero at the right @xmath10 rate as the number of rounds increases .",
    "we achieve this bound in a model which assumes that the losses of all edges on the path chosen by the forecaster are available separately after making the decision .",
    "we also discuss the case ( considered by @xcite and @xcite ) in which only the total loss ( i.e. , the sum of the losses on the chosen path ) is known to the decision maker .",
    "we exhibit a simple algorithm which achieves an @xmath11 per - round regret _ with high probability _ against `` non - oblivious '' adversary . in this case",
    "it remains an open problem to find an algorithm whose cumulative loss is polynomial in the number of edges of the graph and decreases as @xmath13 with the number of rounds .    in section  [ sec : path ] we formally define the on - line shortest path problem , which is extended to the multi - armed bandit setting in section  [ sec : bandit ] .",
    "our new algorithm for the shortest path problem in the bandit setting is given in section  [ sec : alg ] together with its performance analysis .",
    "the algorithm is extended to solve the shortest path problem in a combined label efficient multi - armed bandit setting in section  [ sec : leband ] .",
    "another extension , when the algorithm competes against a time - varying path is studied in section [ sec : tracking ] .",
    "an algorithm for the `` restricted '' multi - armed bandit setting ( when only the sums of the losses of the edges are available ) is given in section  [ sec : generalizedbandit ] .",
    "simulation results are presented in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "consider a network represented by a set of vertices connected by edges , and assume that we have to send a stream of packets from a distinguished vertex , called _ source _ , to another distinguished vertex , called _",
    "destination_. at each time slot a packet is sent along a chosen route connecting source and destination .",
    "depending on the traffic , each edge in the network may have a different delay , and the total delay the packet suffers on the chosen route is the sum of delays of the edges composing the route . the delays may change from one time slot to the next one in an arbitrary way , and our goal is to find a way of choosing the route in each time slot such that the sum of the total delays over time is not significantly more than that of the best fixed route in the network .",
    "this adversarial version of the routing problem is most useful when the delays on the edges can change dynamically , even depending on our previous routing decisions .",
    "this is the situation in the case of ad - hoc networks , where the network topology can change rapidly , or in certain secure networks , where the algorithm has to be prepared to handle denial of service attacks , that is , situations where willingly malfunctioning vertices and links increase the delay ; see , e.g. , awerbuch _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "this problem can be cast naturally as a sequential decision problem in which each possible route is represented by an action .",
    "however , the number of routes is typically exponentially large in the number of edges , and therefore computationally efficient algorithms are called for .",
    "two solutions of different flavor have been proposed .",
    "one of them is based on a follow - the - perturbed - leader forecaster , see kalai and vempala @xcite , while the other is based on an efficient computation of the exponentially weighted average forecaster , see , for example , takimoto and warmuth @xcite .",
    "both solutions have different advantages and may be generalized in different directions .    to formalize the problem , consider a ( finite ) directed acyclic graph with a set of edges @xmath14 and a set of vertices @xmath15 .",
    "thus , each edge @xmath16 is an ordered pair of vertices @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two distinguished vertices in @xmath15 .",
    "a _ path _ from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is a sequence of edges @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the set of all such paths . for simplicity , we assume that every edge in @xmath26 is on some path from @xmath18 to @xmath19 and every vertex in @xmath15 is an endpoint of an edge ( see figure  [ f : dags ] for examples ) .     two examples of directed acyclic graphs for the shortest path problem .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    ( a)(b )    in each round @xmath27 of the decision game , the decision maker chooses a path @xmath28 among all paths from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "then a loss @xmath29 $ ] is assigned to each edge @xmath16 .",
    "we write @xmath30 if the edge @xmath31 belongs to the path @xmath32 , and with a slight abuse of notation the loss of a path @xmath33 at time slot @xmath34 is also represented by @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath35 is given as @xmath36 and therefore the cumulative loss up to time @xmath34 of each path @xmath33 takes the additive form @xmath37 where the inner sum on the right - hand side is the loss accumulated by edge @xmath38 during the first @xmath34 rounds of the game .",
    "the cumulative loss of the algorithm is @xmath39    it is well known that for a general loss sequence , the decision maker must be allowed to use randomization to be able to approximate the performance of the best expert ( see , e.g. , cesa - bianchi and lugosi @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the path @xmath28 is chosen randomly according to some distribution @xmath40 over all paths from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "we study the normalized regret over @xmath0 rounds of the game @xmath41 where the minimum is taken over all paths @xmath33 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "for example , the exponentially weighted average forecaster ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , calculated over all possible paths , has regret @xmath42 with probability at least @xmath43 , where @xmath4 is the total number of paths from @xmath18 to @xmath19 in the graph and @xmath44 is the length of the longest path .",
    "in this section we discuss the `` bandit '' version of the shortest path problem . in this setup , which is more realistic in many applications ,",
    "the decision maker has only access to the losses corresponding to the paths it has chosen .",
    "for example , in the routing problem this means that information is available on the delay of the route the packet is sent on , and not on other routes in the network .",
    "we distinguish between two types of bandit problems , both of which are natural generalizations of the simple bandit problem to the shortest path problem . in the first variant , the decision maker has access to the losses of those edges that are on the path it has chosen .",
    "that is , after choosing a path @xmath28 at time @xmath34 , the value of the loss @xmath45 is revealed to the decision maker if and only if @xmath46 .",
    "we study this case and its extensions in sections [ sec : alg ] , [ sec : leband ] , and [ sec : tracking ] .",
    "the second variant is a more restricted version in which the loss of the chosen path is observed , but no information is available on the individual losses of the edges belonging to the path .",
    "that is , after choosing a path @xmath28 at time @xmath34 , only the value of the loss of the path @xmath47 is revealed to the decision maker .",
    "further on we call this setting as the _ restricted _ bandit problem for shortest path .",
    "we consider this restricted problem in section [ sec : generalizedbandit ] .",
    "formally , the on - line shortest path problem in the multi - armed bandit setting is described as follows : at each time instance @xmath27 , the decision maker picks a path @xmath48 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "then the environment assigns loss @xmath29 $ ] to each edge @xmath16 , and the decision maker suffers loss @xmath49 . in the unrestricted case",
    "the losses @xmath45 are revealed for all @xmath50 , while in the restricted case only @xmath47 is revealed .",
    "note that in both cases @xmath45 may depend on @xmath51 , the earlier choices of the decision maker .",
    "for the basic multi - armed bandit problem , auer _",
    "et al_.@xcite gave an algorithm , based on exponential weighting with a biased estimate of the gains ( defined , in our case , as @xmath52 ) , combined with uniform exploration .",
    "applying their algorithm to the on - line shortest path problem in the bandit setting results in a performance that can be bounded , for any @xmath53 and fixed time horizon @xmath0 , with probability at least @xmath43 , by @xmath54 ( the constants follow from a slightly improved version ; see cesa - bianchi and lugosi @xcite . )    however , for the shortest path problem this bound is unacceptably large because , unlike in the full information case , here the dependence on the number of all paths @xmath4 is not merely logarithmic , while @xmath4 is typically exponentially large in the size of the graph ( as in the two simple examples of figure  [ f : dags ] ) . in order to achieve a",
    "bound that does not grow exponentially with the number of edges of the graph , it is imperative to make use of the dependence structure of the losses of the different actions ( i.e. , paths ) .",
    "awerbuch and kleinberg  @xcite and mcmahan and blum  @xcite do this by extending low complexity predictors , such as the follow - the - perturbed - leader forecaster @xcite , @xcite to the restricted bandit setting .",
    "however , in both cases the price to pay for the polynomial dependence on the number of edges is a worse dependence on the length @xmath0 of the game .",
    "in this section we describe a variant of the bandit algorithm of @xcite which achieves the desired performance for the shortest path problem .",
    "the new algorithm uses the fact that when the losses of the edges of the chosen path are revealed , then this also provides some information about the losses of each path sharing common edges with the chosen path .    for each edge @xmath16 , and @xmath55 , introduce the _ gain _ @xmath56 , and for each path @xmath57 , let the gain be the sum of the gains of the edges on the path , that is , @xmath58 the conversion from losses to gains is done in order to facilitate the subsequent performance analysis . to simplify the conversion , we assume that each path @xmath57 is of the same length @xmath44 for some @xmath59 .",
    "note that although this assumption may seem to be restrictive at the first glance , from each acyclic directed graph @xmath60 one can construct a new graph by adding at most @xmath61 vertices and edges ( with constant weight zero ) to the graph without modifying the weights of the paths such that each path from @xmath18 to @xmath19 will be of length @xmath44 , where @xmath44 denotes the length of the longest path of the original graph . if the number of edges is quadratic in the number of vertices , the size of the graph is not increased substantially .",
    "a main feature of the algorithm below is that the gains are estimated for each edge and not for each path .",
    "this modification results in an improved upper bound on the performance with the number of edges in place of the number of paths . moreover , using dynamic programming as in takimoto and warmuth @xcite , the algorithm can be computed efficiently .",
    "another important ingredient of the algorithm is that one needs to make sure that every edge is sampled sufficiently often . to this end , we introduce a set @xmath62 of _ covering paths _ with the property that for each edge @xmath16 there is a path @xmath63 such that @xmath30 . observe that one can always find such a covering set of cardinality @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the algorithm of @xcite is a special case of the algorithm below : for any multi - armed bandit problem with @xmath4 experts , one can define a graph with two vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath4 directed edges from @xmath18 to @xmath19 with weights corresponding to the losses of the experts .",
    "the solution of the shortest path problem in this case is equivalent to that of the original bandit problem with choosing expert @xmath33 if the corresponding edge is chosen . for this graph ,",
    "our algorithm reduces to the original algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following performance bound for the shortest - path bandit algorithm .",
    "it states that the per round regret of the algorithm , after @xmath0 rounds of play , is , roughly , of the order of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of edges of the graph , @xmath44 is the length of the paths , and @xmath4 is the total number of paths .",

    "the normalized regret of the above algorithms , averaged over 30 runs , as well as the regret of the fixed paths in the graph are shown in figure  [ simulation ] .",
    "although all algorithms showed better performance than the bound for the edge - bandit algorithm , the latter showed the expected superior performance in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , our algorithm for the restricted shortest path problem outperformed awerbuch and kleinberg s ( awkl ) algorithm , while being inferior to its off - line tuned version ( awkl tuned ) . it must be noted that similar parameter optimization did not improve the performance of our path - bandit algorithm , which showed robust behavior with respect to parameter tuning .",
    "we considered different versions of the on - line shortest path problem with limited feedback .",
    "these problems are motivated by realistic scenarios , such as routing in communication networks , where the vertices do not have all the information about the state of the network .",
    "we have addressed the problem in the adversarial setting where the edge losses may vary in an arbitrary way ; in particular , they may depend on previous routing decisions of the algorithm .",
    "although this assumption may neglect natural correlation in the loss sequence , it suits applications in mobile ad - hoc networks , where the network topology changes dynamically in time , and also in certain secure networks that has to be able to handle denial of service attacks .",
    "efficient algorithms have been provided for the multi - armed bandit setting and in a combined label efficient multi - armed bandit setting , provided the individual edge losses along the chosen path are revealed to the algorithms .",
    "the normalized regrets of the algorithms , compared to the performance of the best fixed path , converge to zero at an @xmath10 rate as the time horizon @xmath0 grows to infinity , and increases only polynomially in the number of edges ( and vertices ) of the graph .",
    "earlier methods for the multi - armed bandit problem either do not have the right @xmath10 convergence rate , or their regret increase exponentially in the number of edges for typical graphs . the algorithm has also been extended so that it can compete with time varying paths , that is , to handle situations when the best path can change from time to time ( for consistency , the number of changes must be sublinear in @xmath0 ) .    in the restricted version of the shortest path problem , where only the losses of the whole paths are revealed ,",
    "an algorithm with a worse @xmath11 normalized regret was provided .",
    "this algorithm has comparable performance to that of the best earlier algorithm for this problem @xcite , however , our algorithm is significantly simpler .",
    "simulation results are also given to assess the practical performance and compare it to the theoretical bounds as well as other competing algorithms .",
    "it should be noted that the results are not entirely satisfactory in the restricted version of the problem , as it remains an open question whether the @xmath10 regret can be achieved without the exponential dependence on the size of the graph .",
    "although we expect that this is the case , we have not been able to construct an algorithm with such a proven performance bound .",
