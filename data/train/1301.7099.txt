    "the highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is widely regarded as one of the most promising probes of the high redshift universe , with potential to map out volumes extending from redshift @xmath2 through the epoch of reionization ( eor ) to the dark ages at redshift 20 and beyond ( for reviews of the field , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "numerous facilities and experiments targeting the signal from the eor are already online or under construction , including the low frequency array ( lofar ; @xcite ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) , and the donald c. backer precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ; @xcite ) .",
    "all 21 cm cosmology experiments will need to separate bright galactic and extragalactic foregrounds from the neutral hydrogen signal , which can be fainter by as much as 5 orders of magnitude or more ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to developing schemes to remove or isolate foregrounds from 21 cm data ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "almost all of these approaches rely on the spectral smoothness of foreground emission relative to the 21 cm signal , which will contain significant structure versus frequency .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to use the delay transform technique presented in ( @xcite ; hereafter , p12b ) on observations from paper to test the behavior of actual foreground emission .",
    "we wish to understand the footprint of foregrounds in @xmath3-space to determine which modes of the 21 cm power spectrum will be most accessible to observation .",
    "the structure of this letter is as follows : in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the data used in these observations . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we review the delay spectrum technique presented in p12b , and then describe the steps used in applying this approach to actual observations .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use 4 hours of data collected in 10 second integrations between jd 2455747.48 and 2455747.64 ( @xmath4 july 2011 ) , using a 64 element paper array located on the ska site in the karoo region of south africa .",
    "this data set comes from the same observing campaign described by @xcite , although this specific 4-hour window falls outside of the observations analyzed therein .",
    "the dipole antennas are arranged in a ",
    "minimum redundancy \" configuration optimized for imaging analysis @xcite , which is shown in figure [ fig : antenna_layout ] .",
    "this configuration has a maximum baseline length of @xmath5 m , corresponding to an image plane resolution of @xmath6 at 150 mhz .",
    "the paper correlator has a 100 mhz instantaneous bandwidth from @xmath7  mhz divided into 2048 frequency channels .",
    "we correlate only one linear polarization on each dipole , and discard all data from antennas 40 and 55 which were cross - polarized .",
    "an image of the field transiting during this time period is shown in figure [ fig : skymap ] .",
    "this image spans @xmath8 mhz ; 100 sub - bands of 0.25 mhz were individually imaged and summed to make the map shown .",
    "no cleaning or spectral slope correction was performed .",
    "the observation is centered on a low - foreground  cold patch , \" a potential field for an eor science observation .",
    "the galactic plane , which is just setting at the end of the 4-hour observation , creates prominent sidelobes over the entire map .",
    "complex antenna based gains are derived using fringe - fitting to centaurus a , pictor a , and fornax a ; an overall gain scale is derived from the @xcite source j2214 - 170 .",
    "we perform a small gain linearization correction to mitigate data quantization effects in the correlator ( described in @xcite ) and a correction for temperature dependent gain drifts ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "we also perform radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) excision , manually flagging frequency channels of known transmitters , and flagging any points @xmath9 above the mean after differencing adjacent channels along the frequency axis .",
    "at the core of our analysis is the delay spectrum technique presented in p12b . since cosmological redshifting maps the observed 21 cm line frequency into a distance measurement , the fourier transform of the frequency axis are the @xmath1 line - of - sight modes of the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "however , this relation is clearly not true for foregrounds , where the frequency axis simply corresponds to the spectra of the sources .",
    "the delay transform first presented in @xcite provides a framework for mapping foreground emission into a cosmological @xmath3-space .",
    "the frequency fourier transform of a single baseline s visibility spectrum ( the  delay transform \" ) maps celestial emission to  delay space , \" where sources appear as dirac delta functions , located at the delay in arrival time between the two elements of that baseline .",
    "these delays must be limited to values below the physical light travel time between the two antennas ( the  horizon limit \" ) , and so all emission from the sky maps to a region in the center of delay space determined only by the baseline length . however , any spectral structure in the visibilities acts as a convolving kernel in delay space .",
    "foreground emission is spectrally smooth , translating into a narrow convolving kernel ; 21 cm emission has large amounts of spectral structure , and therefore its kernel scatters power from within the horizon limit to larger delays .",
    "p12b also showed that delay has a near one - to - one mapping to @xmath1 , meaning that those delay modes free from contaminating foreground emission are effective probes of the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "the baseline - length dependence creates better isolation on the shortest baselines , giving rise to the  wedge \" structure seen in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and p12b ; we refer the reader to these works for more detailed and alternative derivations of the  wedge . \"      some of the practical aspects of implementing the delay - spectrum approach in actual data were described in  3 of p12b .",
    "of particular importance is the implementation of the frequency fourier transform using a window function and the 1d - clean algorithm first presented in @xcite to reduce the effects of rfi flags and band - edge effects .",
    "even if foregrounds are spectrally smooth and easily localized in delay/@xmath1-space , such sharp edges in frequency space will introduce significant covariance in delay space , resulting in the scattering of foreground emission into otherwise uncontaminated regions of @xmath3-space .",
    "the 1d - clean algorithm treats rfi flags as a sampling function in frequency space , and  fills in \" these gaps by iteratively fitting the brightest fourier components in the delay domain .",
    "as the sampling function is known exactly , this algorithm has proven extremely effective at removing covariance between delay modes .",
    "the end result is a model of our data which is free of rfi flagging gaps .",
    "we then form power spectra both of this model and the residuals between it and the raw data , before re - combining them . by separating the two components before the fourier transform , we reduce the amount of power that can scatter off rfi gaps , minimizing bright sidelobes which would otherwise contaminate the eor window in the power spectrum .",
    "we force our foreground model to be smooth - spectrum in frequency by only allowing delay - space components which fall inside a baseline - dependent area ( a `` clean box '' ) , 50  ns beyond the physical maximum horizon delay on that baseline .",
    "this extra 50  ns allows the algorithm to model foreground emission pushed beyond the horizon limit . for this work , 50  ns appears to encompass enough foreground emission that the sidelobes of any remaining flux scattering off rfi gaps in the residuals are below the noise .",
    "since our results do detect additional emission beyond our chosen cut - off , its exact value may need to be revisited in future analyses with more sensitivity .",
    "once the data have been cleaned , we form power spectra on a visibility - by - visibility basis .",
    "our power spectrum estimates follow from equation ( 12 ) of @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the observing frequency , @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 is the solid angle of the primary beam , in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , relate @xmath14 to an effective cosmological volume , using a top - hat primary beam or effective area as a pedagogical tool to simplify the result . more generally , however , the effective @xmath13 in equation [ eq : pk ] is actually @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the power response of the primary beam .",
    "a derivation of this effect will be presented in a subsequent full length publication by parsons et al . for paper , this beam is a factor of @xmath17 smaller than @xmath18 . ]",
    "@xmath19 is the observing bandwidth , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are cosmological scalars which convert observed angles and frequencies into @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a delay transformed visibility .",
    "we avoid introducing a noise - bias by forming our estimator @xmath24 from adjacent time samples on a baseline .",
    "the 10-second interval between integrations is short enough that both measurements can be considered redundant samples of the same @xmath3-modes .",
    "the isotropy of the universe allows us to then combine all power spectrum estimates @xmath24 in annuli of equal @xmath25 to form a 2d power spectrum in the @xmath0-plane .",
    "we note that the method used here does not take advantage of any coherent integration within a @xmath26-pixel .",
    "since foreground emission dominates the observed signal , the loss of sensitivity is not important , and we ignore this effect for computational efficiency . for eor science runs",
    ", however , paper explicitly focuses on maximizing the sensitivity boost from coherent integration , using ",
    "maximum redundancy \" configurations designed to sample select @xmath26-pixels for long periods of time .",
    "to make power spectra of the 4-hour dataset described above , we first run our clean algorithm over the full 100  mhz band .",
    "using the whole band gives the best resolution in delay space , and since foregrounds are nearly coherent over the whole band , the additional information gives clean the most signal - to - noise to build its model .",
    "for the cosmological delay transform to make power spectra , we use only a 25 mhz band from 140  to  165  mhz .",
    "this smaller band still exceeds the @xmath27  mhz band over which the @xmath28 universe can be treated as coeval @xcite .",
    "since the main purpose of this work is to understand the @xmath3-space behavior of foregrounds , we ignore this effect , as the additional bandwidth gives us better @xmath3-space resolution .",
    "forming individual power spectra from each baseline of the array and binning in @xmath29 yields the 2-dimensional @xmath30 shown in figure [ fig : wedge ] .",
    "the @xmath25-axis is binned with a resolution of @xmath31 ; gaps are visible where there are no baselines of that length .",
    "we do no binning in @xmath1 ; this resolution is set by the 25  mhz bandwidth used in the analysis .",
    "is statistically independent . ]",
    "the most prominent feature is the  wedge \"- like shape of the foreground emission as predicted .",
    "as argued in p12b , this ",
    "wedge \" footprint in @xmath3-space is not a result of imperfect calibration in foreground removal ( since we attempt no foreground removal in this work ) , but a property of the emission itself as measured by an interferometer .",
    "the white diagonal line in figure [ fig : wedge ] corresponds to the horizon - limit in @xmath1 for a baseline of corresponding length @xmath25 ; the orange line is 50  ns beyond the horizon , inside of which we allowed fourier components in the deconvolution described in  [ sec : clean ] .",
    "as predicted , emission extends beyond the horizon limit due the intrinsic spectral structure of the foreground emission .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the supra - horizon emission does not have a constant width in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "rather , more emission extends beyond the horizon on the smallest @xmath25-values ( i.e. the shortest baselines ) .",
    "we expect this behavior to result from two different effects .",
    "first , the shortest baselines will resolve out less of the diffuse galactic synchrotron , so that the emission will be brighter .",
    "therefore , we can see its sidelobes extend further in @xmath1 before they fall below the noise level .",
    "the second effect is somewhat more subtle and can be best illustrated with an example .",
    "consider two east - west baselines of length 10 and 100@xmath11 at 150 mhz , which correspond to light travel times ( i.e. horizon limits ) of 66.7 and 667  ns , respectively .",
    "a point source @xmath32 above the eastern horizon corresponds to geometric delays of 62.6 and 626  ns on these baselines .",
    "if the source spectrum has a given amount of `` unsmoothness '' and creates a delay space kernel of width 10  ns , then this kernel , centered at the geometric delay of the source , will lead to emission beyond the horizon on the @xmath33 baseline , but not on the @xmath34 baseline .",
    "this example illustrates how the same sources of emission will naturally lead to more corruption of supra - horizon delays on shorter baselines than on longer ones .",
    "finally , we draw attention to the  edge brightening \" of the foreground emission in the wedge on the longest baselines as one moves near the horizon limit .",
    "this feature can be attributed to the galactic plane , and moves as expected when the data are viewed as a function of time .    to highlight the steepness of the foreground roll - off , we plot 1-dimensional @xmath35 power spectra for bins of several baseline lengths in figure [ fig : pspec1d ] .",
    "we see that the foreground emission can fall by as much as three to four orders of magnitude in a factor of 2 change in @xmath1 .",
    "it is difficult to explicitly compare this result to the predictions of p12b , due to the different resolutions and binning used .",
    "the placement of bin edges can significantly complicate comparison when the fall - off is so steep , as a slight shift in the bin can result in a large change in the average value within . for similar reasons , it is difficult to say exactly where the emission falls below the noise",
    ". given these caveats , there is nothing in these data to contradict p12b .",
    "it is clear , however , that sensitivities will have to increase significantly before anything can be said about the behavior of foreground emission at the tens of mk@xmath36 level where the expected eor signal lies .",
    "to both demonstrate the effectiveness of the delay - space foreground isolation and to further investigate the nature of the supra - horizon emission , we high - pass filter the data in delay - space , selecting only delay modes more than 50  ns beyond the horizon limit , i.e. , we select the emission lying beyond the orange line in figure [ fig : wedge ] .",
    "we then image this data from 140 to 165 mhz in one - hundred 0.25 mhz bins to form a data - cube versus frequency .",
    "finally , we fourier transform our data - cube versus frequency to create maps of individual @xmath1 modes .",
    "three of the resultant maps for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are shown in figure [ fig : fmodes ] .",
    "the flux scale in these images has been reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude from figure [ fig : skymap ] , demonstrating the effectiveness of delay - space filtering . interpreting the flux scale in the lowest @xmath1 modes",
    "is complicated , since most of baselines at these modes have been filtered off , whereas , the @xmath39 mode is effectively a noise map .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig : wedge ] that this mode lies above the wedge , and therefore nothing has been filtered from it .",
    "the rms in this map ( calculated from the complex data ) is 14 mjy .",
    "we can estimate the expected noise level using : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 is the solid angle of the primary beam , @xmath11 is the observing wavelength , @xmath42 is the system temperature , @xmath43 is the number of antennas in the array , @xmath19 is the bandwidth , and @xmath44 is the observing time @xcite . for this observation @xmath13 = 0.75  sr , @xmath45 hours , @xmath46  m , @xmath47  mhz , and @xmath42 = 1000",
    "k. this somewhat high value for @xmath42 is reasonable given the galactic emission in these observations ; the values of @xmath42 for paper will be presented in a forthcoming publication by parsons et al .",
    "using these values gives an expected rms of 14  mjy , in accord with our measurement .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 maps are clearly not noise dominated .",
    "accounting for the noise that was removed by filter , these data have rough  effective \" rms values of 35  mjy , well in excess of our noise estimate . given the presence of emission in these modes above the orange line in figure [ fig : wedge ] , it is not surprising that we see excess power .",
    "what is surprising is that none of this emission can be easily associated with the brightest sources or structures visible in figure [ fig : skymap ] .",
    "rather , it appears that the bulk of the emission contaminating the eor window comes from an aggregate of fainter emission .",
    "one might be concerned that emission can leak from lower @xmath1 bins into the modes shown , but as argued in  [ sec : clean ] , our deconvolution algorithm is extremely effective at eliminating this covariance .",
    "however , we caution the reader against interpreting these maps as images of true coherent structures on the sky .",
    "the fact that the spatial pattern of emission changes significantly from @xmath48 to @xmath49 suggests the emission is a diffuse background and our images are limited by sidelobes .",
    "we note one additional interesting feature in these maps .",
    "the noise - dominated @xmath50 gives a good impression of the paper primary beam shape .",
    "in the 0.06 and @xmath49 maps , however , bright emission extends well beyond the half - power point of the beam ( roughly @xmath51 fwhm ) . under the lens of the delay transform ,",
    "one suspects that the emission closest to the horizon can most easily create supra - horizon emission .",
    "these images show that while emission from well outside the beam fwhm contributes significantly to the supra - horizon emission , the paper primary beam roll - off is enough to keep this pattern from extending all the way out the edge of the image .",
    "we have presented new observations from paper measuring the properties of foreground emission in cosmological fourier space .",
    "these observations have confirmed general predictions presented in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and p12b : that foreground emission occupies a  wedge \" in the 2d @xmath0 plane , leaving a window at higher @xmath1 values for 21 cm eor studies . we have also confirmed that shorter baselines yield a larger window onto the cosmological signal .",
    "however , this the window does not grow perfectly linearly with decreasing baseline length . therefore , while shorter baselines do make the best probes of the eor signal , there will be diminishing returns at the shortest baselines .",
    "we have also presented an images of several @xmath1 modes of  unsmooth \" emission extending past the nominal edge of the wedge .",
    "these images are unable to localize any of the emission to known sources on the sky , suggesting that the most problematic foregrounds for eor observations are a diffuse background ."
