    "the dual superconductivity picture @xcite for quark confinement @xcite was proposed long ago and it is now believed to be a promising mechanism for quark confinement . the dual superconductivity is supposed to be realized as an electric - magnetic dual of the ordinary superconductivity . for this to be possible , there must exist magnetic monopoles to be condensed for causing the dual meissner effect , just as the cooper pairs exist and they are condensed to cause meissner effect in the ordinary superconductivity .",
    "the idea of dual superconductivity is intuitively easy to understand , but upgrading this idea into a quantitative theory was not so easy , as can be seen from a fact that we are still involved in this work .",
    "the possible topological soliton in pure yang - mills theory @xcite ( with no matter fields ) is only the yang - mills instanton @xcite with a finite action integral and integer pontryagin index in @xmath10 dimensional euclidean spacetime where the continuous map @xmath11 : @xmath12 is classified by the homotopy @xmath13 .",
    "however , we have some arguments suggesting that yang - mills instantons do not confine quarks in four dimensions , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the @xmath14 case .",
    "for instance , in the georgi - glashow model , point - like magnetic monopoles exist as instantons in three dimensions , leading to the area law of the wilson loop average @xcite .    in view of this , t hooft @xcite has proposed an explicit prescription which enables one to extract ( abelian ) magnetic monopoles from the yang - mills theory as gauge - fixing defects , which is called the abelian projection method . in this prescription ,",
    "the location of an abelian magnetic monopole in @xmath15 yang - mills theory is specified by the simultaneous zeros ( of first order ) in @xmath16 of a three - component field @xmath17 , which we call the monopole field hereafter . as a result ,",
    "an abelian magnetic monopole is a topological object of co - dimension 3 if they exist at all , characterized by a continuous map @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , an abelian magnetic monopole is represented by a point in @xmath14 , as expected . in @xmath10 dimensions",
    "the world line of a magnetic monopole must draw a closed loop , not merely an open line , due to the topological conservation law of the magnetic monopole current .",
    "( a magnetic current extending from an infinity to another infinity can be also identified with a closed loop . )",
    "it is known that large magnetic monopole loops are the most dominant configurations responsible for confinement .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for a review .",
    "the second obstacle is the lack of information as to how the magnetic monopole is related to the original yang - mills field in a gauge - invariant manner . in the t hooft proposal ,",
    "the monopole field @xmath20 is an arbitrary composite operator of the yang - mills field @xmath21 as long as it transforms according to the adjoint representation under the gauge transformation , e.g. , @xmath22 ( a component of the field strength @xmath23 ) .",
    "the maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) @xcite is well - known to be the most effective choice in practical calculations , corresponding to a specific choice for the monopole field in the abelian projection method .",
    "the mag is given by minimizing the gauge - fixing functional written in terms of the off - diagonal gluon fields @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 $ ] using the gauge degrees of freedom to transform the gauge field variable as close as possible to the maximal torus group @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to establish the relationship between the abelian magnetic monopole in question and an original yang - mills field . for this purpose ,",
    "some works have already been devoted to constructing explicit configurations of the magnetic monopole loops from appropriately chosen configurations of the yang - mills field .",
    "in fact , chernodub and gubarev @xcite have pointed that one instanton or the set of instantons arranged along a straight line induce an abelian magnetic monopole current along a straight line going through centers of instantons within mag . in this case , the magnetic monopole is given by the standard static hedgehog configuration . however",
    ", this solution yields a divergent value for the gauge - fixing function of mag : @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "therefore , it must be excluded in four dimensions .",
    "a laborious and important work has been done by brower , orginos and tan ( bot ) @xcite who investigated within the mag whether the magnetic monopole loop represented by a circle with a non - zero and finite radius can exist for some given instanton configurations or not .",
    "they concluded the absence of such a stable magnetic monopole loop for one - instanton yang - mills background : a circular magnetic monopole loop centered on an instanton is inevitably shrank to the center point , if one imposes the condition of minimizing the mag functional @xmath28 . while an instanton - antiinstanton pair seems to support a stable magnetic monopole loop , although it is not a solution of yang - mills equation of motion .",
    "these results suggest that instantons are not the topological objects responsible for quark confinement from the viewpoint of the dual superconductivity .",
    "moreover , these conclusions heavily rely on their hard work of numerically solving partial differential equations .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for the corresponding result obtained from numerical simulations on a lattice .",
    "subsequently , bruckmann , heinzl , vekua and wipf ( bhvw ) @xcite have performed a systematic and analytical treatment to this problem within the laplacian abelian gauge ( lag ) @xcite , which has succeeded to shed new light on the relationship between an abelian magnetic monopole and an instanton from a different angle . in the lag ,",
    "zeros of an auxiliary higgs field @xmath20 induce topological defects in the gauge potential , upon diagonalization .",
    "it is important to notice that the nature of the defects depends on the order of the zeros . for first - order zeros ,",
    "one obtains magnetic monopoles .",
    "the defects from zeros of second order are hopfion which is characterized by a topological invariant called hopf index @xcite for the hopf map @xmath29 with non - trivial homotopy @xmath30 .",
    "they have solved the eigenvalue problem of the covariant laplacian @xmath31d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a}]$ ] in the adjoint representation in the background of a single instanton @xmath32 ( in the singular gauge ) : @xmath33d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a}]\\vec{\\phi}(x)=\\lambda \\vec{\\phi}(x ) $ ] and have obtained the auxiliary higgs field @xmath20 as the ( normalizable ) ground state wave function having the lowest eigenvalue @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , they have found that the auxiliary higgs field @xmath20 is given by the standard hopf map : @xmath35 in the neighborhood of the center of an instanton and by a constant , e.g. , @xmath36 after normalization in the distant region far away from the center where two regions are separated by the scale of the instanton size parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the zeros of the auxiliary higgs field @xmath20 agree with the origin .",
    "this results enable one to explain the bot result without numerical calculations . in bhvw ,",
    "however , @xmath38 was replaced by a four sphere @xmath39 of a finite radius in order to obtain a finite lag functional ( convergent integral ) .",
    "see also @xcite for relationships among various topological objects .",
    "in the course of studying the relationship between abelian magnetic monopole and center vortices @xcite , merons @xcite are recognized as important object @xcite .",
    "merons @xcite are solutions of the yang - mills field equation and are characterized by one half topological charge , i.e. , having half - integer pontryagin index .",
    "these configurations escaped from the above consideration , since they have infinite action due to their singular behaviors .",
    "however , once they receive an ultraviolet regularization which does not influence quark confinement , they can have finite action and contribute to the functional integration over the yang - mills field in calculating the wilson loop average , based on action and entropy argument in the strong coupling region above a critical value .",
    "in fact , callan , dashen and gross @xcite have discussed that merons are the most dominant quark confiner .",
    "in fact , reinhardt and tok @xcite have investigated the relationship among abelian magnetic monopoles and center vortices in various yang - mills back ground fields : one meron , one instanton , instanton - antiinstanton pair , using both the lag and the laplacian center gauge ( lcg ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that abelian magnetic monopole and meron pair are mediated by sheets of center vortices @xcite .",
    "in fact , montero and negele @xcite have obtained an abelian magnetic monopole loop and center vortices for two merons ( meron pair ) by using numerical simulations on a lattice , see also @xcite for related works .",
    "the third obstacle in these approaches lies in a fact that topological objects such as abelian magnetic monopoles and center vortices are obtained as gauge fixing defects .",
    "therefore , they are not free from criticism of gauge artifacts .",
    "recently , we have given a gauge - invariant ( gauge independent ) definition of magnetic monopoles @xcite and vortices @xcite in yang - mills theory in the framework of a new reformulation of yang - mills theory based on change of field variables founded in @xcite .",
    "the lattice version has been constructed to support them by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these are suggested from a non - abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop operator @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we investigate how the gauge - invariant magnetic monopoles are obtained analytically for a given yang - mills background field in four dimensions . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we show that the previous results @xcite obtained for one - meron and one - instanton are easily reproduced within our reformulation . in sections 6",
    ", we give a new result for gauge - invariant magnetic monopole loops in yang - mills theory : it is shown in an analytical way that there exist circular magnetic monopole loops joining two merons .",
    "this will be the first analytical solution of stable magnetic monopole loops constructed from the yang - mills field with non - trivial but finite pontryagin index .",
    "( bruckmann and hansen @xcite constructed a ring of magnetic monopole by superposing infinitely many instantons on a circle .",
    "this configuration has infinite action and infinite pontrayagin index . )",
    "the analytical solution for magnetic monopole loops given in this paper correspond to the numerical solution found by montero and negele @xcite on a lattice .",
    "the result in this paper has rather interesting implications to the quark confinement mechanism . as mentioned above , the gauge - invariant magnetic monopole is a complicated object obtained by the non - linear change of variables from the original yang - mills field , although they are fundamental objects necessary for the naive dual - superconductivity scenario of quark confinement . in other words ,",
    "the result in this paper indicates that a meron pair is the most relevant quark confiner if viewed from the original yang - mills theory , as callan , dashen and gross @xcite suggested long ago .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite , we have given a prescription for obtaining the gauge - invariant magnetic monopole from the original yang - mills field @xmath40 .",
    "\\(i ) for a given su(2 ) yang - mills field @xmath41 , the color field @xmath42 is obtained by solving the differential equation : @xmath43d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) = \\mathbf{0 }    ,   \\label{rde1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we call the reduction differential equation ( rde ) . here",
    "the color field has the unit length @xmath44    \\(ii ) once the color field @xmath42 is known , the gauge - invariant `` magnetic - monopole current '' @xmath45 is constructed by applying the exterior derivative @xmath46 , the coderivative ( adjoint derivative ) @xmath47 and hodge star operation @xmath48 to @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath49 is the _ gauge - invariant _ two - form defined from the gauge connection one - form @xmath32 by @xmath51 -     \\partial_\\beta [ \\mathbf{n}(x ) \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_\\alpha(x ) ]     \\nonumber\\\\    & +   ig^{-1 } \\mathbf{n}(x ) \\cdot [ \\partial_\\alpha \\mathbf{n}(x ) \\times   \\partial_\\beta \\mathbf{n}(x ) ]       .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the current @xmath45 is conserved in the sense that @xmath52 . in @xmath10 dimensions ,",
    "especially , we have @xmath53 and the magnetic charge @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes a parameterization of the 3-dimensional volume @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the dual of the 3-dimensional volume element @xmath59 : @xmath60 see @xcite for @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) case .",
    "the rde in our reformulated yang - mills theory has the same form as that considered in bot @xcite , but its reasoning behind the rde is quite different from the previous one , as can be seen from its derivation in appendix [ appendix : rc ] , see @xcite for more details .",
    "we now give a new form of the rde ( eigenvalue - like equation ) : @xmath63d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) = \\lambda(x ) \\mathbf{n}(x )    .   \\label{rde2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that solving the rde ( [ rde1 ] ) is equivalent to look for the color field @xmath42 such that applying the covariant laplacian @xmath31d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a}]$ ] of a given yang - mills field @xmath40 to the color field @xmath42 becomes parallel to itself .",
    "it should be remarked that @xmath64 is non - negative , i.e. , @xmath65 since @xmath31 d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a}]$ ] is a non - negative ( positive definite ) operator .",
    "the equivalence between ( [ rde1 ] ) and ( [ rde2 ] ) is shown as follows .",
    "let @xmath66 be local orthonormal basis in su(2 ) color space , i.e. , @xmath67 then we can write the left - hand side of ( [ rde2 ] ) using three scalar functions @xmath68 as @xmath63d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) = c_1(x ) \\mathbf{e}_1(x ) + c_2(x ) \\mathbf{e}_2(x ) + c_3(x ) \\mathbf{e}_3(x )   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now ( [ rde1 ] ) is written as @xmath69d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) ] = c_1(x ) \\mathbf{e}_2(x ) - c_2(x ) \\mathbf{e}_1(x )     .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by taking the inner product of both sides of this equation with @xmath70 or @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath74d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) =   c_3(x ) \\mathbf{e}_3(x ) = : \\lambda(x ) \\bm{n}(x ) $ ] .",
    "an advantage of the new form ( [ rde2 ] ) of rde is as follows .",
    "once the color field @xmath42 satisfying ( [ rde2 ] ) is known , the value of the reduction functional @xmath75 is immediately calculable as an integral of the scalar function @xmath64 over the spacetime @xmath16 as @xmath76 \\mathbf{n}(x ) ) \\cdot ( d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) )    \\nonumber\\\\   = &    \\int d^dx \\frac12   \\mathbf{n}(x ) \\cdot ( -d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a } ] \\mathbf{n}(x ) )     \\nonumber\\\\   = &   \\int d^dx \\frac12   \\mathbf{n}(x ) \\cdot \\lambda(x ) \\mathbf{n}(x )     \\nonumber\\\\   = &   \\int d^dx   \\frac12   \\lambda(x )   ,   \\label{rc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ unit ] ) in the last step .",
    "thus , the problem of solving the rde has been reduced to another problem : for a given yang - mills field @xmath40 , look for the unit vector field @xmath42 such that @xmath31 d_\\mu[\\mathbf{a}]\\mathbf{n}(x)$ ] is proportional to @xmath42 with the smallest value of the reduction functional @xmath75 which is an integral of the scalar function @xmath64 over the spacetime @xmath16 . for the integral ( [ rc ] ) to be convergent , @xmath64 must decrease rapidly for large @xmath77 .",
    "our method should be compared with the conventional one of the laplacian abelian gauge ( lag ) @xcite .",

    "\\label{lagf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is not the case for the reduction functional @xmath75 .",
    "in what follows , we restrict our considerations to the four - dimensional @xmath10 euclidean yang - mills theory .",

    "this symmetry enables one to separate the rde into the angular and radial parts .",
    "we define the generators of four - dimensional euclidean rotations as @xmath98 indeed , it is straightforward to check that @xmath99 satisfies the lie algebra of @xmath97 . the angular part is expressed in terms of angular momentum derived from the decomposition : @xmath100 in analogy with the lorentz group , one introduces the angular momentum and boost generators : @xmath101 and their linear combinations : @xmath102 the operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 generate two independent @xmath15 subgroups with casimir operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 having eigenvalues @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively : @xmath109 here it is important to note that the eigenvalues @xmath110 and @xmath111 are half - integers .",
