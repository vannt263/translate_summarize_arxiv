    "about 60%  of the _ intrinsic _ bolometric luminosity of star forming populations is emitted between 912  and 3000  with little variation in this fraction with star formation duration ( from models of leitherer et  al .",
    "hence uv light is potentially very useful for measuring star formation .",
    "it represents direct emission from hot main - sequence stars , the same stars that will provide the majority of the mechanical energy feedback into the ism .",
    "the uv spectrum is very rich in features that can be used to diagnose the stellar populations and intervening ism .",
    "the overall intrinsic spectral slope in the uv is fairly constant . for young ionizing populations",
    "it is set by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the planck function .",
    "when looking at high redshifts the importance of the rest - frame uv increases ; at a fixed bandpass it is the last stop before the lyman - edge .",
    "the big problem with using uv measurements is dust , which most efficiently absorbs and scatters uv radiation .",
    "the absorbed uv light is reradiated at far infrared ( fir ) wavelengths . not only is the amount of dust important , so to is its distribution .",
    "if the geometry is unfavorable , as in the mixed stars and dust model , then the uv emission will be dominated by the stars closest to the observer and the center may be practically invisible ( e.g.  witt , thronson , &  capuano 1992 ) . fortunately , this is not the case for a wide range of starburst galaxies as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for them the fir to uv flux ratio , or infrared excess ( irx ) , which gives the effective dust absorption , correlates with the uv spectral slope @xmath3 ( meurer et  al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "this is a prediction of the dust screen model ( witt et  al . ) . while variations on this geometry can also explain this correlation ( calzetti 1997 ; charlot &  fall 2000 ) , the mere fact of this correlation allows one to recover the intrinsic luminosity of starbursts using uv quantities alone .",
    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 are similar to local starbursts .",
    "in particular they have similar seds ( dickinson 2000 ) , spectral properties ( tremonti et  al .",
    "2000 ) , ism dynamics ( e.g.  pettini et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and surface brightnesses ( meurer et  al .",
    "they are also noticeably redder than dust - free starbursts .",
    "meurer et  al.(1999 ) used the rest frame colors of lbgs and the irx-@xmath3 correlation to estimate that the hubble deep field lbg sample suffers from a factor of about five in dust absorption at rest @xmath4 .",
    "it is hard to test whether the irx-@xmath3 correlation actually holds for lbgs because predicted fir fluxes are typically just below current detection limits with instruments such as scuba .",
    "other data show that what little we know about the lbgs is consistent with them obeying the same reddening law as local starbursts .",
    "for instance , we assumed that the fir - radio correlation holds , and took the lbgs with the top ten predicted fir emission and predicted summed radio fluxes of 27 @xmath5jy , and 105 @xmath6jy ( assuming a 0.3 dex uncertainty on each flux ) at observed frame wavelengths 3.5 cm and 20 cm , while the richards ( 2000 ) data yield measured summed fluxes of 28 @xmath7jy , and 100 @xmath8jy respectively . adopting irx-@xmath3 , adelberger &  steidel ( 2000 ) show that the uv detectable galaxies at @xmath9 and 3 can account for most or all of the fir background at 850 @xmath10 m .",
    "this rosy view of the utility of uv astronomy flies in the face of what we have learned over the last few decades : that dust enshrouded star formation is best seen in the infrared . would not dust obstruct our view of star formation , even at high-@xmath1 ?",
    "the bright scuba sources , in particular , are inferred to have @xmath11 , usually have little or no rest - frame uv emission and probably have an equal contribution to the star formation rate density as non - dust corrected lbgs ( barger , cowie , &  richards 2000 ) .",
    "they have @xmath12 , so the best local analog to them are thought to be the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) .",
    "relatively little was known about the uv properties of uligs , until trentham , kormendy &  sanders ( 1999 ) presented weak uv detections of three uligs with hst s _ faint object camera _ and surace &  sanders ( 2000 ) showed that they are detectable from the ground in the @xmath13 band .",
    "we have been granted hst time to image seven galaxies in the uv using the stis ( _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ) mamas which have much higher sensitivity than the foc .",
    "our sample was chosen to have @xmath14 , starting in @xmath15 where the iue sample ends .",
    "so far six galaxies have been observed , five of these are uligs .",
    "we detect all of these in both the far uv ( fuv ; @xmath16 ) and near uv ( nuv ; @xmath17 ) . in both bands ,",
    "uv emission can be detected projected to within 1 kpc of the infrared nuclei seen by nicmos ( scoville et  al .",
    "however , especially in the fuv , very little , if any uv emission is detected within the inner few hundred parsecs where most of the bolometric luminosity probably originates .",
    "figure 2 shows the irx-@xmath3 diagram for our sample compared to the iue starbursts .",
    "typically only 0.5%  of the bolometric luminosity is observed in the fuv .",
    "furthermore , the irx-@xmath3 correlation _ under - predicts _ the fir emission of uligs by factors ranging from 7 to 70 . the fir flux is still under - predicted if only the light within 1 kpc of the ir nucleus is considered . in these galaxies",
    "irx-@xmath3 only gives a lower limit to the fir flux .",
    "these results confirm that uligs represent galaxies with star formation almost totally hidden from the uv .",
    "our work shows that we must still be cautious with rest - frame uv observations of galaxies : they may harbor hidden - star formation beyond that predicted with the irx-@xmath3 correlation .",
    "however , not all galaxies are as extreme as uligs . at high-@xmath1",
    ", the most luminous lbgs can not generally have irx values like uligs or else more would be detected at 850@xmath10 m with scuba ( multiply predictions in table 4 of meurer et  al .",
    "1999 by 7  70 ) .",
    "could uligs be selected as lbgs ? at @xmath18 uligs would have an observed frame @xmath19 abmag .",
    "presumably they would have very red @xmath20 colors resulting from the strong opacity of the lyman forest and edge .",
    "therefore , they should have the right colors to be selected as lbgs . however at this redshift they would be very faint , having @xmath21 to 30 abmag , at or beyond the limits of many current surveys such as the hubble deep fields .",
    "so uligs still make good analogs to scuba sources , but probably only contribute to the faint end of the lbg population .",
    "uligs have also been touted as good local prototypes for extremely red objects ( eros ) . using our photometry and published results we find that uligs emit enough rest - frame uv emission , that at @xmath22 or 3.5 in the observed frame they would have @xmath23 abmag .",
    "this is bluer than @xmath24 , the definition of eros ( graham &  dey 1996 ) . since our sample is small , and some approach this limit perhaps some more extreme uligs may be recognized as eros at high-@xmath1 , but in general they would be too blue"
