    "the gutzwiller variational wave function together with the gutzwiller approximation ( ga )  @xcite is a widely used approach in order to deal with hubbard - type models .",
    "originally introduced in order to explore the possibility of ferromagnetism within the hubbard model ( see e.g. , ref .   and",
    "references therein ) its popularity resides in the fact that it captures correlation effects like the band narrowing already on the variational level .",
    "more recently the ga has been also used for realistic band structure computations .",
    "@xcite since in the hubbard model one has a competition between delocalization , from the hopping of the charge carriers , and localization , from the onsite interaction @xmath0 , the idea is to apply a projector to a given slater determinant which reduces the number of doubly occupied sites . within",
    "the ga one has to minimize an energy functional which is composed of a renormalized kinetic term and the interaction energy @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the concentration of doubly occupied sites .",
    "on the other hand , mean - field theories , like hartree - fock ( hf ) , are usually only the first step in a many - body computation and it is often desirable to include the effect of fluctuations within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . in case of hf this has been achieved by numerous techniques ( for an overview see e.g. , ref .  ) , however , the development of a similar scheme in the ga has been a long - standing problem of the condensed - matter many - body community .",
    "the major step in this direction was the reformulation of the ga by kotliar and ruckenstein ( kr ) within the so - called four slave - boson approach .",
    "@xcite this method maps the physical hole ( or particle ) into products of fermion and boson operators where the latter additionally label the occupancy of the site . at the saddle - point level",
    "the bosons are replaced by their mean - field values and one recovers the ga energy functional showing its underlying mean - field character .",
    "the kr slave - boson formulation offers the possibility of going beyond the gutzwiller result by the inclusion of transversal spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite moreover , in principle , it provides a controlled scheme of including fluctuations beyond the mean - field solution .",
    "however , the expansion of the kr hopping factor @xmath3 is a highly nontrivial task , both with respect to the proper normal ordering of the bosons and with respect to the correct continuum limit of the functional integral .",
    "@xcite expansions around the slave - boson saddle point have been performed for homogeneous systems in refs .   in order to calculate correlation functions in the charge and longitudinal spin channels .",
    "furthermore , the optical conductivity in the paramagnetic regime of the hubbard model has been calculated in ref .  .",
    "a severe difficulty in this approach is the fact that the kr choice for the hopping factor did not lead to controlled sum rules .",
    "@xcite moreover , to our knowledge , this approach has not been extended to symmetry broken states due to the complexity of the computation .",
    "recently , two of us have presented a computation of rpa fluctuations on top of ga states ( ga+rpa ) .",
    "@xcite our approach borrows ideas from well developed techniques in nuclear physics ,  @xcite and rpa fluctuations are obtained in the small oscillation limit of a time - dependent gutzwiller approximation . since response functions are derived for systems with completely unrestricted charge and spin distributions ga+rpa is suitable also for the calculation of charge excitations on solutions with inhomogeneous textures .",
    "a key point of the ga+rpa approach is the proper determination of the time dependence of the variational double occupancy parameter .",
    "we have adopted an antiadiabatic approximation in the sense that the double occupancy adjusts instantaneously to the time evolution of the single particle densities . in this context",
    "our approach can be viewed as a generalization of the fermi liquid analysis of vollhardt .",

    "[ model ] we present the formalism .",
    "we concentrate on the case of the one - band hubbard model although generalization to more complicated models is straightforward . from the expansion of the ga energy functional up",
    "to second order in the densities we demonstrate how the rpa response functions can be calculated and demonstrate that standard sum rules are obeyed .",
