    "( [ rhoz ] ) . in fig .  [ six ] we show the time evolution of @xmath160 . even on a linear scale the delocalization effects can be clearly visible , especially in the case when the solitons initially repel each other",
    ".    experimental realization of the anderson localization of a single soliton and observation of the delocalization effects in the case of a pair of interacting solitons requires the absence of decoherence effects .",
    "the most dangerous are atomic losses which localize centers of mass of the solitons and prevent interference phenomena needed in the anderson localization process . in the present paper we concentrate on @xmath84rb atoms in the vicinity of the feshbach resonance at magnetic field of 155 g.",
    "the scattering length assumed in our analysis corresponds to the magnetic field of about 169 g. for this magnetic field the two- and three - body loss rates measured experimentally are @xmath161 @xmath162 and @xmath163 @xmath164 , respectively , and the background loss time is 450  s @xcite . assuming that the density profile of the atomic cloud is a product of the 1d soliton density and the density of the harmonic oscillator ground state in the transverse directions , the resulting lifetime is 160  s , i.e. 5.5 in the units ( [ units ] ) .",
    "this seems to be sufficient time to see the delocalization effects analyzed in the present publication .",
    "we have considered quantum bright solitons in the presence of an external disorder potential . when a single soliton is placed in the disorder , anderson localization of its center of mass",
    "is predicted by @xcite .",
    "if two solitons are present the mutual interaction between them can be responsible for the breakdown of the localization .",
    "we have analyzed this phenomenon within the perturbation approach and by means of numerical integration of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the perturbation approach shows that exponential tails of the probability densities for the centers of mass of the solitons disappear due to coupling of an unperturbed eigenstate to high energy delocalized states that is induced by the solitons interaction .",
    "the interaction induced delocalization is different from the typical situation @xcite because apart from the relative distance between the solitons , the interaction potential depends also on the relative phase between them . in the numerical integration , where we can afford stronger interactions than in the perturbation analysis , we observe that the localization of the solitons can be totally broken .",
    "the results obtained in the present publication can be verified in experiments .",
    "they also indicate that in order to observe experimentally the anderson localization of solitons , a single soliton has to be excited and preparation of soliton trains should be avoided .",
