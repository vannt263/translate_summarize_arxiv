    "at present , some of the constraints on the parameters of the galaxies stellar  population models are uncertain by more than an order of magnitude ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "even so , the stellar  population ages and star  formation histories of the models have broad implications for galaxy evolution at higher redshifts ( see ferguson , dickinson , & papovich 2002 ) .",

    "the advantage of this method as applied to faint galaxies is that it reduces concerns about psf and aperture  matching effects on the relative photometry and permits deblending of objects partially merged by the terrestrial seeing .",
    "we identified high  redshift galaxies whose seds reveal a spectral discontinuity at the observed lyman limit , which arises from absorption systems along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we selected `` @xmath0dropout '' galaxies with , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( see * ? ? ?",

    " frame uv spectra ( which is indicative of ongoing star formation ; leitherer et al.1999 ) . indeed , using the @xmath20 spectroscopic redshifts available for goods objects , we observe no contamination from stars or galaxies at @xmath21 .",
    "our modeling indicates that these criteria identify galaxies with an expected redshift distribution that peaks at @xmath22 and tapers to higher and lower redshifts , with 50% completeness limits of @xmath23 .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] , we show the @xmath24 versus @xmath25 color  magnitude diagram for the @xmath0dropout galaxies . for @xmath1 ,",
    "these colors correspond approximately to rest ",
    "frame @xmath26 .",
    "although most of the @xmath0dropout galaxies have relatively blue rest  frame uv  to  optical colors , the brightest galaxies in @xmath25 have redder optical  infrared colors with a fairly well  defined `` blue ",
    "envelope '' .",
    "because this sample is selected in the @xmath27band , there is no reason to expect that the lack of bright galaxies ( @xmath28 ) with blue colors is due to some selection effect . at fainter magnitudes , part of this trend",
    "may be due to increasing photometric uncertainties .",
    "however , the trend among the @xmath0dropouts is apparent even at bright magnitudes where the photometric errors are small , and exists for the @xmath3dropouts ( see below ) , where the optical and ir data are much deeper than the goods data .    a similar blue ",

    "the @xmath3dropout criteria identify galaxies with a mean redshift , @xmath32 , and 50% completeness limits of @xmath33 . although the galaxy samples for the hdf ",
    "n and s are originally detected in nir data , our tests using an @xmath34band  selected sample for the hdf ",
    "n yield essentially no change in the number of selected @xmath3dropout galaxies nor in the number and luminosity densities derived below .",
    "the advantage of using these data is that they provide band  matched catalogs from optical  to ",
    "nir wavelengths that are comparable to the data for the @xmath0dropout galaxies .    for the @xmath4 galaxies , the @xmath30 color corresponds to nearly identical rest",
    " frame colors as @xmath24 for the galaxies at @xmath1 . the color  magnitude trends at @xmath4 and 4 are strikingly similar .",
    "thus , the lbgs at both @xmath4 and @xmath1 seem to require that either ( or likely some combination of ) the mean stellar population age , metallicity , and/or dust opacity increase with optical luminosity .",
    "furthermore , we also note that the @xmath3dropout galaxies have slightly redder rest ",
    "frame @xmath35 colors as evidenced by the fact that the `` blue  envelope '' shifts by @xmath36  mag .",
    "this reddening seems to imply that the mean ages , metallicity , and/or dust opacity are actually increasing from @xmath37 to 3 .",
    "to measure the number and luminosity densities , we require the redshift distribution and effective volumes probed by the @xmath3 and @xmath0dropout criteria . for the @xmath3dropout galaxies",
    ", we have used the effective volume derived by @xcite . for the @xmath0dropout galaxies",
    ", we have simulated artificial lbgs in the goods data with a distribution of colors and sizes that match the observed @xmath0dropout properties ( see ferguson et al .",
    "we then measure photometry for the simulated galaxies and apply our color  selection criteria to derive the probability that a lbg with given magnitude and redshift is detected in the data , @xmath38 .",
    "this technique accounts for incompleteness due to magnitude and surface  brightness effects as well as the color  selection process .",
    "we then compute the effective volumes , @xmath39 . because these selection criteria are insensitive to heavily obscured galaxies and to galaxies with passively evolving , older stellar populations , our estimates of galaxy densities are strictly lower limits , derived from the uv  bright population alone .    to calculate the galaxy densities we consider galaxies brighter than @xmath40  mag , where @xmath41 for the @xmath3dropouts ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 has been adjusted slightly to account for differences in cosmology and the mean redshifts of the samples here and those of steidel et al . ) , and @xmath44 for the @xmath0dropouts ( giavalisco et al .",
    "we derive specific luminosity densities by integrating the flux densities in each bandpass to @xmath40  mag ( where the @xmath0dropout galaxies are well  detected in both the acs and isaac data , see figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the observed number density , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the luminosity distance .",
    "we plot the measured values in figure  [ fig : sed ] along with uncertainties from a bootstrap resampling .",
    "note that we have made no correction for fainter galaxies .",
    "the area of the hdfs and the portion of the goods field with isaac imaging are fairly small , and cosmic variance may be a substantial source of uncertainty ( see somerville et al .",
    "2003 ) . to limit this effect on our results",
    ", we have normalized the luminosity densities of both the @xmath3 and @xmath0dropout samples such that they match the rest - frame uv values of steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and giavalisco et al.(2003b ) , respectively , while preserving the measured `` color '' between the rest ",
    "frame uv and other wavelengths .",
    "these surveys average over more area and sightlines than considered here , which significantly reduces the uncertainties from cosmic variance .",
    "cosmic variance may still be a factor for the @xmath0band luminosity densities .",
    "the luminosity weighted mean rest - frame @xmath49 colors of the @xmath3dropout galaxies in the hdf  n and -s vary by @xmath50  mag , which provides an estimate on the uncertainty in the typical luminosity  density colors of lbgs in single hdf - sized fields .",
    "future studies using the entire goods dataset ( with full @xmath3band and nir observations of both fields ) will substantially increase the sample size of both the @xmath3 and @xmath0dropouts by roughly a factor of @xmath51 and 10 , respectively , and should strengthen our results .",
    "the fact that the rest ",
    "frame 1600    luminosity density is roughly unchanged ( to within @xmath52% ) implies that the star  formation rate ( sfr ; at least of massive , ob stars ) is roughly constant ( see , e.g. , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "however , we observe marginal evidence for a steepening of the uv continuum ( @xmath53   ) , and strong evidence ( @xmath54% confidence ) that the average @xmath35 color becomes redder for the @xmath3dropouts relative to those for the @xmath0dropouts . in particular , the luminosity density at rest ",
    "frame 4400    grows from @xmath55  erg s@xmath56 hz@xmath56 mpc@xmath57 at @xmath37 to @xmath58  erg s@xmath56 hz@xmath56 mpc@xmath57 at @xmath4 .",
    "based on the observed color distribution of lbgs ( to fainter magnitude limits than our samples here ) , our simulations suggest that this result is unlikely to be biased significantly by the color  selection of these galaxies .",
    "this change in the mean color suggests that the mean stellar mass  to  light ratio of these galaxies is also increasing .",
    "therefore , the total stellar mass density of this population is presumably growing by more than the @xmath5% increase seen in the rest ",
    "frame @xmath0band optical light .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a substantial build  up in the global stellar mass density from @xmath4 to @xmath59 .",
    "the present results extend that trend to still higher redshifts .",
    "the luminosity densities constrain the global , average star  formation histories of galaxies at @xmath60 .",
    "one possible scenario is a roughly constant sfr with an unchanging dust content .",
    "this would produce approximately equal @xmath61 at @xmath29 and 4 , and build up the global stellar mass with time , which would redden the average galaxy sed from @xmath1 to @xmath4 as the @xmath0band light increases .",
    "we note that the universe ages by @xmath62% from @xmath1 to 3 , and may imply that galaxies formed stars at a near  constant rate from @xmath63 to 3 .",
    "an alternative scenario is a rising sfr from @xmath1 to 3 with an increasing dust content that is tuned to produce a roughly constant @xmath61 , and is consistent with the suggestion that the uv continuum is redder at @xmath4 .",
    "the fractional stellar ",
    "mass build - up in this scenario would be still greater than that with constant sfr and an unchanging dust content .",
    "both of the above scenarios invoke a sfr that is either constant or growing in time .",
    "however , the stellar populations observed in @xmath4 galaxies appear to be young ( a few @xmath64  yr for simple , monotonic star  formation histories ; sawicki & yee 1998 ; papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "2001 ) , which implies that these stars had not formed by @xmath1 .",
    "galaxies at these redshifts probably have star  formation histories that are more complex ( with multiple formation episodes ) than those described by the simple models ( see ferguson et al .",
    "however , even though the star  formation histories for individual galaxies may be fairly stochastic , the global , average sfr at high redshift must be roughly constant in order to explain the evolution in the uv and optical luminosity densities .",
    "although the increase in the observed optical luminosity density from @xmath65 to @xmath4 appears robust , the uncertainties due to cosmic variance and other systematics are non - negligible .",
    "if there is , in fact , no evolution in the optical luminosity density then this could imply that stars formed in the @xmath0dropout galaxies are not present within the @xmath3dropout galaxies , and that at some point the @xmath1 galaxies cease forming stars and evolve beyond the @xmath3dropout selection criteria .",
    "this would have interesting implications for constraints on the sources of reionization and/or on the imf at higher redshifts ( see , e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , this would likely be inconsistent with the low number density of red , @xmath66 objects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the majority of galaxy evolution models predict growth in the stellar  mass density by amounts consistent with our observations ( although specific predictions vary from model to model ; see dickinson et al .",
    "2003 , and references within ) , and this suggests that much of the stellar  mass assembly at high  redshifts does occur in these uv  bright galaxies .",
    "we have compared the rest  frame uv  optical colors of color  selected galaxies at @xmath1 to those of similarly selected galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "we find a great degree of similarity in the rest ",
    "frame @xmath2 versus @xmath0 diagram for galaxies from @xmath60 . however , although the rest  frame uv luminosity densities at @xmath1 and @xmath4 are comparable , there is evidence that the rest ",
    "frame @xmath0band luminosity density grows by @xmath67% .",
    "even though the star  formation histories of individual galaxies may involve complex and stochastic processes , the evolution of the luminosity density corresponds to a globally average sfr that is constant or increases with time .",
    "this implies that the average stellar - mass  to  light ratio of galaxies is also increasing over this redshift range and that the global stellar  mass density grows by more than @xmath5% over the @xmath68  gyr interval that elapses between @xmath1 and 3 .    by selecting in the rest ",
    "frame uv , we are likely to miss galaxies without ongoing , relatively unobscured star formation . for example , @xcite have used deep nir images of the hdf  s to identify red galaxies which may have evolved , massive stellar populations at @xmath69 , and may contribute significantly to the global stellar mass density .",
    "such objects would be missing from the samples here , leading to an underestimate of the total density .",
    "logically , the number and mass content of these red galaxies should grow as the universe ages .",
    "therefore , the apparent increase in stellar mass density from @xmath37 to 3 , as traced here by the uv  bright population , would only be strengthened if red , uv  faint objects were also considered .",
    "ultimately , the full goods dataset will permit more direct tests of the star ",
