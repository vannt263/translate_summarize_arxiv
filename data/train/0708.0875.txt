    "liquid argon time projection chambers ( lar tpc ) are nearly optimal detectors for neutrino experiments looking for @xmath0 appearance on a @xmath1 beam in the energy range 0.5  5 gev .",
    "the lar tpc technology has been proposed for the measurement of @xmath2 , cp violation in the neutrino sector and determination of the mass hierarchy ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and to study the miniboone low energy anomaly @xcite .",
    "the technique is equally promising for proton decay searches @xcite .",
    "a lar tpc for neutrino physics was first proposed in 1977 by carlo rubbia and a vigorous r&d program was then established , which produced decisive steps in defining the technology and its applicability to particle physics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "very remarkably , images taken in a lar tpc are comparable in quality with pictures from bubble chambers . as for bubble chambers",
    ", events can be analyzed reconstructing 3-momentum and particle type for each track in the event image , down to low energy ( few mev for electrons , few tens of mev for protons ) ; the calorimetric performance ranges from good to excellent , depending on event energy and topology .",
    "equally important , the lar tpc technology is suitable for very massive ( several 10 ktons ) detectors , as required in most contemporary neutrino physics .",
    "a very active r&d program is on going in the u.s . ; as part of this larger effort , a lar tpc has been developed at yale starting in 2005 .",
    "the detector has been commissioned in early 2007 , and cosmic ray tracks have been imaged .",
    "preliminary results are presented here .",
    "1 .   _ cryogenics : _ the lar tpc is housed in a cylindrical stainless steel vessel of total volume 500  l. the inside walls are electropolished .",
    "the vessel is evacuated to few 10@xmath3 mbar ( at lar temperature , 87 k ) prior to filling with ultra pure lar .",
    "the vessel is cooled to lar temperature by an open bath filled with commercial , non - purified lar .",
    "it takes about five hours to cool down the system and fill it until the tpc is fully covered ( about 250  l of ultra - pure lar ) .",
    "the total lar consumption is @xmath4 1,000  l for a 24 hr long experiment .",
    "the top flange of the tpc vessel ( fig .",
    "[ f1]-@xmath5 ) houses several ports : feedthroughs for the tpc high - voltage , signal cables , test pulse and capacitive level meter , high voltage feedthrough and optical feedthrough for a purity monitor mounted inside the vessel , pumping line , filling line , relief valve , pressure gauges , and a window .",
    "all the seals are cf or vcr . the top flange itself is sealed using a viton o - ring , therefore the system is not designed to be vacuum - tight at lar temperature in steady state . the adopted filling procedure is to break the vacuum using ultra - pure cold ar gas while the lar open bath is about half full . in steady state",
    "the system runs at an overpressure of 0.3 atm .",
    "the relief valve has been provided by h. jostlein of fnal .",
    "liquid ar purification : _ the necessity to drift free electrons in lar for _ o_(1 millisecond ) or longer sets very stringent requirements on the purity of lar , at the level of several tens of parts per trillion of o@xmath6-equivalent contamination ( cf .",
    "few parts per million in commercially available lar ) .",
    "the filters to purify lar have been developed and built at fnal and are described in @xcite ; a detailed paper is in preparation .",
    "the filter itself is made of a copper alumina catalyst , packaged in a cf nipple with sinterized steel caps .",
    "the filter is regenerated in place at yale .",
    "commercial grade lar is purified with a single pass through the filter , without any additional molecular sieve , at a rate of @xmath460  l / hr . to measure the electron lifetime independently of the tpc operation , a purity monitor ( see @xcite , and provided by the fnal group )",
    "was mounted underneath the tpc .",
    "a loss of drifting charge due to attachment to impurities of less than 10% over a drift time of 0.5  ms has been repeatedly measured in the tpc vessel , stable over a period of 24 hours without recirculation .",
    "tpc and electronics : _ the fiducial volume of the lar tpc ( fig .",
    "[ f1]-@xmath7 ) is a cylinder of 33  cm diameter and 17  cm tall .",
    "the field cage is made of 6 hollow stainless steel rings , separated by teflon spacers , and connected through a chain of 100  m@xmath8 resistors .",
    "there are two parallel readout wire planes , with 50 wires each and a wire pitch of 5 mm .",
    "flat cables are soldered to the wire planes and reach the readout electronics through a signal feedthrough ( infn - padova / icarus ) , which holds 512 channels .",
    "the readout electronics is the same as the icarus one and has been provided by the infn - padova / icarus group @xcite .",
    "the lar tpc has been tested on the readily available cosmic rays . during data taking the electric field in the drift region",
    "was 100   v / cm , and 250  v / cm between the induction and the collection planes .",
    "the signals from the induction plane were rather noisy due to capacitive coupling with the high voltage in the drift region , and are not presented here .",
    "the data acquisition was triggered on the sum coincidence of one board ( 25 channels ) of the collection plane .",
    "some events recorded during a cosmic ray run are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] .",
    "the signal is well visible over noise on each of the hit wires .",
    "the drift velocity in lar at 100  v / cm is 0.5  mm/@xmath9s , with a maximum drift time of 340  @xmath9s .",

    "the lar purification is a recent development , applied for the first time to a working imaging instrument , while the readout electronics has been provided by the icarus collaboration .",
