    "this variation must be equal to direct variation h = h ^ ^+ h a _ a_. we must note that the variables ( @xmath22 and @xmath20 ) can not be varied freely , but they must obey @xmath27 which follows the constraint .",

    "[ hjeq ] now , this hamilton - jacobi s equation of motion is modified because of the constraint .",

    "the constraint @xmath32 that was produced in going to canonical variables is called  primary constraint \" , which can be plural , and the constraints produced from consistency condition like eq.([12 ] ) are called  secondary constraints \" .",
    "further , we must check if consistency conditions for secondary constraints hold , and have in our case @xmath34 where we have used one of the equations of motion @xmath35 .",
    "this condition holds since we can expect @xmath36 for electric charge .",
    "hence , we do not have a tertiary constraint .",

    "the hamiltonian above , the poisson brackets and the constraints will consistently describe the dynamics .      to quantize a system with gauge symmetry , people usually carried out gauge fixing and eliminated a part of variables . fixing gauge means adding as much conditions as necessary to fix the gauge freedom .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a way of quantization that does not fix the gauge .",
    "we will simply replace for the first class constraint @xmath39 , not fixing the gauge(see p34 , of @xcite ) .",
    "if one pursues that direction , we should already have reached this paper s conclusion that there exists physical freedom of electrostatic field and the conventional method of taking only the transverse modes is not correct .",
    "it seems , however , that dirac was not pursuing that direction .",
    "the author also could not find any other author who is pursuing .",

    "but we have no problem as far as we do nt forget that this is an approximation for a spatially extended state .",
    "another way to do with the problem is introducing a fictitious infinitesimally small mass @xmath14 and letting @xmath49 its ground state approximates the state of @xmath50 because x & = & ( a + a^)/ , + p & = & -i(a - a^ ) , @xmath51 = 1,\\ ] ] and the ground state is defined by @xmath52 and then we have @xmath53 this approximation holds if the relevant time scale is smaller than @xmath54 .",

    "[ vac ] the third condition @xmath76 , which is easier for some of calculation , is an approximation for @xmath77 this approximation is justified because the difference between the ground state @xmath78 of a harmonic oscillator with a very small frequency @xmath14 and the state of zero canonical momentum @xmath79 is very small , as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "further , the @xmath80 term in @xmath23 does not have any effect owing to the constraint @xmath81 .",
    "let us consider the quantum state of electrostatic field for a system with a classical and localized charge distribution @xmath82 .",

    "please note that this state is already normalized .",
    "that is because commuting that exponential of @xmath87 in eq.([1 ] ) to have only normal ordered terms gives a normalization factor like @xmath88 .",
    "this state is already normalized even though higher order multiparticle states have larger factor in the expansion .",
    "this is because commuting the terms in the formula ( [ 1 ] ) so as to have only normal ordered terms gives overall factor @xmath88 , which is appropriate for normalization .    in this formalism , the electrostatic field @xmath89 is plainly a local operator and a observable .",
    "we note that the @xmath70 proportional part of electric field @xmath0 takes an continuous value even after quantization as well as @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",

    "we see that @xmath95 is an eigenstate of @xmath0 and that the strength @xmath96 is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from a far enough charge .",
    "contrarily , in the conventional quantum theory of gauge field , a classical state with an electric field is not a state in the quantum sense , and electric field @xmath97 is not a quantum observable nor a local operator .",
    "for instance , let us take coulomb gauge @xmath98 , where @xmath70 proportional part of @xmath99 is removed . then using the constraint ( [ 12 ] ) , we have @xmath100 .",
    "solving this , we obtain @xmath101 substituting this to @xmath60 dependent part of the hamiltonian : @xmath102 , we obtain h_coulomb = 12d^3x d^3x ( x ) ( x ) 14|x - x| .",
    "[ hcoulomb ] this part of @xmath23 gives the effect of electrostatic field , but now the classical state variable of electrostatic field is lost , and electrostatic force is now a superluminal infinite distant force between the electrons .",
    "the conventional coulomb gauge prescription is quantizing this classical hamiltonian from which the electrostatic field is removed .",
    "then the electrostatic field is not an operator and does not have corresponding quantum state .",
    "since other well - known gauge prescriptions are the same in that they leave only transverse mode , they have the same problem of not having electrostatic field .      in classical mechanics ,",
    "the time variation of @xmath60 depends on @xmath28 as @xmath103 , which is a part of the canonical equations of motion ( [ hjeq ] ) .",
    "further , @xmath99 depends on @xmath28 through @xmath60 in @xmath104 , which is one of equations of motion too .",
    "if one change @xmath28 by @xmath105 , the change of @xmath60 is @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "then , we have @xmath108 , which is the familiar gauge transformation .    in the schrdinger picture of quantum theory , we ca nt apply any time varying gauge transformation since the operators do not vary in time . a gauge transformation by time independent @xmath109 can be performed by applying a generator @xmath110 @xmath111 and we get a & = & [ , a ] = + & = & i. we do nt have transformation for @xmath60 here , but we do nt have problem because we do nt need @xmath60 in constructing and time - developing physical states as we will see later .",
    "this transformation does not change physical state since @xmath112 , and it wo nt change any observed value of physical observable that is gauge independent .",
    "now we would like to start discussing interaction .",
    "for that purpose , we must , in advance , clarify what is the  states \" , which appear before and after interaction .",
    "we must know what ",
    "a particle \" is in field theory , because the main actor in scattering and the other physical processes is the  particles \" . in the conventional quantum field theory , answering this question and describing quantum states of a particle was vaguely evaded .",
    "instead , people used lsz s reduction formula .",
    "the advantage in departing from lsz formalism is that finite time transient phenomena can be now predicted by this formalism , which contrasts to that only the scattering processes between the infinite past and the infinite future may be calculated in lsz formalism .",
    "we will begin by perturbatively constructing the vacuum state , 1-particle states , and multiparticle states in order .",
    "we defined the vacuum as the lowest energy eigenstate of @xmath23 satisfying the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "perturbatively , the solution is @xmath113 where @xmath75 is the free field vacuum defined by eqs.([vac ] ) , and interaction part in @xmath23 is @xmath114 since we may ignore the constraint - proportional part of the hamiltonian ( [ 15 ] ) .",

    "the electrostatic field was given by @xmath367 .",
    "how can we have electrostatic field when @xmath294 and @xmath368 ?",

    "the conventional methods each had different reason for justification .",
    "gauge fixing by elimination was justified by thinking that variables may be eliminated before quantization .",
    "they thought that two variable may be solved away even though the gauge transformation has only one degree of freedom .",
    "it was possible because one of the conditions is the euler - lagrange equation related with electrostatic field .",

    "feynman s ghost justified itself by making the idea self - consistent that only transverse polarization is physical .",

    "gauge fixing by adding constraints was justified by thinking that 4 variables may be eliminated before quantization .",
    "they think that 4 variable may be solved away even though the gauge freedom is only one degree .",
    "the elimination was possible because dirac s extended hamiltonian increased the freedoms and a new undetermined variable took over the electrostatic field .",
    "why all the conventional methods consistently lead to the same result , even though they each had different reason for justification ?",
    "the suspected reason is that they each constructed these theories by giving glance on the quantum theory of radiation .",
    "the belief of transversality prevailed in the quantum theory of radiation from its beginning , i.e.  in 1930 s .",
    "these conventional theories are not wrong by itself , because they are self - consistent .",
    "the question is which of ours or theirs does describe the physics more appropriately .",
    "in this paper , the belief of transversality was discredited .",
    "the belief of transversality is that only transverse polarizations are physical degrees of freedom and need to be quantized .",
    "if one believe that only transverse modes exist , it well lead to non - existence of electrostatic field as quantum object .",
    "moreover , our formalism has shown it possible to describe a configuration of electrostatic field as a quantum state .",
    "the observable of electrostatic field obtained from our theory took continuous value .    in our intuitive understanding ,",
    "electrostatic field is a measurable quantity that exists at every space point , and every measurable quantity should have a quantum counterpart as an observable . in the conventional theory , in contrast",
    ", the electrostatic field is not a physical observable on space but a superluminal force between electrons , which is easily seen in the coulomb gauge .",
    "this is counterintuitive but thought to be inevitable .",
    "our formalism allows intuitive and natural understanding on the other hand .",
    "many people believe that reduction commutes with quantization .",
    "that is , we will get the same theory if we first eliminate classical gauge freedoms and then quantize , or if we quantize and then take gauge - invariant subspace",
    ". a mathematical counterpart of this question is called guillemin - sternberg conjuecture@xcite , and proven in a limited setup of finite dimension .",
    "the method of elimination and the method of adding constraints are examples of this classical reduction , and they are different from ours .",
    "so , this conjecture should not hold in gauge field theories .",
    "the reader may also have the same idea as the author that dirac has proposed this equivalence under the commutation .",
    "actually , dirac did for the second class constrains , but not for the first class constraint .",
    "it seems that our formalism have a problem of less looking covariant in spite of its advantages . because we have the condition @xmath300 on the states",
    ", we should rather understand that all the possible configurations of @xmath60 are summed , i.e.  all the possible gauges are summed in our formalism . since it is the sum of all the possible configurations , we may think it is totally covariant overall .",
    "the reason why it looks non - covariant may be that the method for solving the equations of motion is dependent on the time slice , e.g.  the mode expansion formula ( [ a ] ) is dependent .",
    "further , we can ensure existence of solution and do nt have multiple solutions for the equation @xmath390 , which is necessary for gauge transforming from arbitrary @xmath391 to @xmath294 .",
    "this is better than the other gauges , e.g.  @xmath392 , for which neither existence nor multiplicity of solution is known well .",
    "next , let us comment about implications of our theory .",
    "the dynamics of color - electric field line should be the cause of confinement of quarks in qcd , therefore the conventional quantization methods , which has only with transverse mode , wo nt be able to show confinement .",
    "in contrast to the conventional theory , our theory may predict such thing as the separation dependence of color electric force between two stationary quarks . showing",
    "the mass gap and confinement in the non - abelian gauge theory is a major problem in physics and mathematics .",
    "the ground , or the axiom , on which the theorem of confinement and mass gap should be proven , is now changed .    in the attempts at quantizing gravity",
    ", we frequently come across upon the problem of whether we could deduce ordinary continuous space - time or not .",
    "since the parallel between electrostatic fields and the continuous static space - time is apparent , we may expect deducing continuous space - time likewise .",
    "it may be reasonably suspected that the belief of transversality is the cause of the difficulty of the current attempts at quantum gravity too .",
    "the conventional formalisms , especially brst formalism , are eliminating not only the freedom of gauge transformation but also the freedom of electrostatic field .",
    "in other words , the freedoms of fp ghost is equal to the freedom of gauge plus that of electrostatic field , i.e.  l modes .",
    "we may also say that the brst symmetry is a two - fold extended symmetry that consists of not only gauge symmetry but also forcefully added freedom of electrostatic field .",
    "the theorems that were proven using the brst symmetry will need rework . if a theorem is not wrong physically or mathematically , it will be possible to reinterpret the theorem in physically meaningful way .",
    "it is likely that the theorems will become the ones about electrostatic field because brst symmetry minus the trivial gauge symmetry is electrostatic part .",
    "let us next comment about implication on the higgs mechanism . because there is no helicity zero degree of freedom in the conventional formalisms , we must supply degrees of freedom from elsewhere to make a massive vector boson possible .",
    "for this reason , the higgs particles were required .",
    "but in our case , we have helicity zero states , that is the l modes , and then it may be possible to have massive vector boson without higgs particle .",
    "this possibility was already discussed in @xcite by the author .",
    "the lattice gauge theory should be equivalent to our theory because , in dealing with gauge symmetry , they are the same in that they both do nt do forced gauge - fixing , and that no kinetic term exists for l mode , i.e.  zero energy excitement .",
    "it will soon be shown in the numerical experiments that the lattice gauge theory agrees to ours .    in conclusion ,",
    "our formalism suggests another consistent way of quantizing gauge theory . the brst formalism and the belief of transversality should need careful revision , where they are closely related to each other as explained in section 3",
    "so , all the works that rely on the belief of transversality will need rethink ."
