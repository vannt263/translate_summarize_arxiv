    "it is well known that an essential characteristic of compounds forming liquid crystals is the rod - like shape of their constituent molecules , with an high length to breadth ratio .",
    "therefore the molecules are supposed to be cylindrically symmetrical .",
    "for example , the ordering matrix which is often used to describe the partial alignment in a mesophase , contains only one independent element and this can be determined by some techniques [ 1 ] .",
    "the fact that the molecular cylindrical symmetry is assumed is appealing to a statistical mechanician , because the pairwise anisotropic intermolecular potential required in any calculation is simple for such particles [ 2 ] .",
    "however the molecules , in fact , are lath - like and thus do not possess the high symmetry .",
    "the ordering matrix has two principal components and therefore these components are required to describe the orientational order of a uniaxial mesophase composed of lath - like molecules . in this sense , the deviation of this ordering matrix from cylindrical symmetry was found to be significant [ 3 ] .",
    "the importance of deviations from cylindrical symmetry may be inferred from unambiguous determinations of the ordering matrix for rod - like molecules , such as @xmath0 [ 4 ] . moreover it is found that these matrices are comparable to those estimated for a pure mesophase [ 3 ] .",
    "there are some studies in which the consequences of deviations from molecular cylindrical symmetry are investigated .",
    "it is shown that a system consisting of particles with a lower symmetry than @xmath1 is capable of existing either as a uniaxial or a biaxial liquid crystal [ 5 ] .",
    "the possible existence of a biaxial phase is studied in detail for a system of hard rectangular plates using a lattice model [ 6 ] , the landau approach [ 7 ] and the molecular field approximation [ 8 ] .",
    "the deviations of the ordering matrix from cylindrical symmetry is clearly determined by the molecular symmetry and the element of the ordering matrix for the long axis will also be influenced by the form of the pseudo - intermolecular potential .",
    "the calculations of the ordering matrix for an ensemble of hard rectangular particles is performed in [ 9 ] .",
    "it must be emphasized that although these calculations are of some interest , they may not be particularly realistic because some experiments indicate that dispersion forces may make a dominant contribution to the anisotropic intermolecular potential [ 9 ] .",
    "considering the cases above , luckhurst et al .",
    "developed a theory [ 10 ] for non - cylindrically symmetric molecules interacting via a completely general intermolecular potential within molecular field approximation .",
    "for a decade , nonextensive statistics has an increasing interest and recently tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) has been applied to the nematic - isotropic transition [ 11 - 13 ] as a nonextensive statistics . in [ 11 ] , the maier - saupe mean field theory has been generalized within tt and applied to a nematic liquid crystal , para - azoxyanisole . in the other study ,",
    "[ 12 ] , the the effects of the nonextensivity on the dimerization process has been studied , and finally the mean field theory of anisotropic potentail of rank @xmath2 has been generalized within tt and the effect of the nonextensivity on the order parameters has been illustrated in [ 13 ] . up to now , the mean field theories for uniaxial nematogens formed by cylindrically symmetric molecules have been studied by using tt . in this manner , we aim , in this study , to enlarge the applications of tt to the liquid crystal systems and to handle luckhurst et al.s theory which considers the molecules to be non - cylindrically symmetric . in doing so , we first give some essential properties of luckhurst et al.s theory .",
    "then we mention on tt and its axioms .",
    "finally , we apply tt to the luckhurst et al.s theory and some possible concluding remarks are made",
    ". we must emphasize that we would like to give only the possible contributions of the nonextensivity to the theory .",
    "so we must keep in mind that since one relies on the generalized theory or not , more extensional studies related with it must be performed in the nematic - isotropic transition .",
    "however , we believe that this study is sufficient to give motivation for further applications of tt to the liquid crystals .      the intermolecular potential for particles of general shape is given by [ 10 ] @xmath3 in a product basis of wigner rotation matrix [ 14 ] , where @xmath4 is the distance between molecules @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the orientation of molecule @xmath7 in a coordinate system containing the intermolecular vector as the @xmath8 axis is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "this potential energy is invariant under rotation of the coordinate system about @xmath10 axis .",
    "therefore the summation in eq.(1 ) can be restricted  as follows [ 10 ] : @xmath11 in what follows , the redundant subscripts on the coefficient @xmath12 will be suppressed . because it is convenient to define the molecular orientation in terms of a common coordinate system , the potential energy @xmath13 could be transformed to a laboratory frame .",
    "the choice of this coordinate system is determined according to the symmetry of the liquid crystal phase , so for a uniaxial mesophase , the laboratory @xmath10 axis can be taken to be parallel to the symmetry axis of the mesophase .",
    "the transformation of @xmath14 is carried out by performing the rotation from the intermolecular vector to the molecule in two steps using the relationship @xmath15 where the subscript @xmath16 is the rotation from the laboratory to the intermolecular frame , @xmath17 denotes that from the laboratory to the molecule coordinate system .",
    "then the intermolecular potential can be written as @xmath18 if the distribution function for the intermolecular vector is independent of orientation , then one could use the orthogonality of the rotation matrices to evaluate the ensemble average : @xmath19 the partially averaged potential may then be written as @xmath20 then now it is the time to average over the orientations adopted by particle @xmath6 .",
    "however one needs @xmath21 .",
    "this average is taken to be independent of the orientation of molecule @xmath5 within the molecular field approximation and it is to be identified with the normal ensemble average .",
    "since we only consider a uniaxial mesophase , @xmath22 vanishes when @xmath23 and @xmath24 is even . in this manner ,",
    "the potential is reduced to the following form : @xmath25 where the summation is over @xmath26 ( @xmath24 even ) .",
    "the scalar contribution could be ignored because we would only like to study the orientational properties of the mesophase .",
    "the average of the orientational pseudo - potential for molecule @xmath5 is given by @xmath27 the expansion coefficients in eq.(8 ) are defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29  is the scalar potential of the ensemble [ 10,15 ] .",
    "the pseudo - potential is conveniently written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the euler angles and define the orientation of the director in the molecular coordinate system .",
    "luckhurst et al . made some comments in [ 10 ] on this form of the pseudo - potential and the symmetry properties of the coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "because luckhurst et al . investigated the influence of deviations from molecular cylindrical symmetry on various orientational order parameters for a uniaxial nematic mesophase , they tried to minimize the number of the variables in the calculation without any loss of the essential physics .",
    "as a first approximation , they considered only those terms with @xmath24 equal to @xmath6 in the expansion of the pseudo - potential .",
    "the neglect of terms higher than quadratic could be a good approximation , since similar assumptions for cylindrically symmetric molecules had let to results in reasonable accord with experiment [ 10,16 ] . as mentioned in [ 10 ] , the number of expansion coefficients are reduced by appealing to some specific model for the interactions or by imposing symmetry restrictions on the molecules .",
    "if one follows straley [ 9 ] and takes the molecules to be hard rectangular parallelopipeds , then the coefficients @xmath35  are independent of the sign of either @xmath36 or @xmath37 and zero if either of these subscripts is odd , that is @xmath38 /3 , \\\\",
    "c_{220 } & = & \\left ( l^{2}-bw\\right ) \\left ( b - w\\right ) /\\sqrt{6 } , \\\\ c_{222 } & = & -l\\left ( w - b\\right ) ^{2}/2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the length , @xmath39 the breadth and @xmath40 the width of the molecule .",
    "it must be noted that this parametrization is only approximate [ 9 ] and also anisotropic repulsive forces are probably not dominant in determining the behaviour of real nematics . therefore assuming the molecules to interact via dispersion forces , the expressions for @xmath35 could be derived .",
    "the similar restriction can be imposed on the expansion coefficients @xmath41 , without appealing to specific forms of the intermolecular interactions , by using more formal arguments based on the molecular symmetry and its influence on the pair potential .",
    "for example , if each molecule has a centre of symmetry , then [ 10 ] @xmath42 and consequently @xmath43 in addition , if the molecules also possess a plane of symmetry orthogonal to their @xmath10 axes , then @xmath44 and @xmath45 however eqs.(16,18 ) can only be consistent when both @xmath36 and @xmath37 have even values .",
    "moreover the coefficients are independent of the sign of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    then the pseudo - potential may be written as @xmath46 \\left [ d_{0,j}^{(l)}(\\beta \\gamma ) + d_{0,-j}^{(l)}(\\beta \\gamma ) \\right ] /(1+\\delta _ { 0j})(1+\\delta _ { 0p}).\\ ] ] according to the restrictions above . if limiting the summation to those terms with @xmath24 equal to @xmath6 , one has @xmath47 d_{0,0}^{(2)}(\\beta ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2\\left [ c_{200}\\overline{d_{0,0}^{(2)}}+2c_{222}\\overline{d_{02}^{(2)}}% \\cos ( 2\\gamma ) \\right ] d_{0,2}^{(2)}(\\beta ) \\cos ( 2\\gamma ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a reduced wigner rotation matrix [ 14 ] .",
    "the second rank order parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 in this expression are related to the principal elements of the ordering matrix by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the order parameter @xmath53 indicates the deviation of the ordering matrix from cylindrical symmetry . for simplicity , it is convenient to write the pseudo - potential as @xmath54 , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 /kt\\ ] ] and @xmath56 /kt.\\ ] ] the partition function for this single particle potential is then given by @xmath57 \\sin \\beta d\\beta \\,d\\gamma .\\ ] ] the orientational molar potential energy and the molar entropy are given as follows @xmath58 , \\\\ s & = & -r\\left [ a\\,\\overline{d_{0,0}^{(2)}}+b\\,\\overline{d_{0,2}^{(2)}\\cos ( 2\\gamma ) } \\right ] + r\\ln ( z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "then the orientational molar free energy is straightforward : @xmath59 -rt\\ln ( z).\\ ] ] the order parameters are calculated from the equations below : @xmath60 \\sin \\beta d\\beta \\,d\\gamma } { % z}\\ ] ] and @xmath61 \\sin \\beta d\\beta \\,d\\gamma } { % z}.\\ ] ] it is worthwhile to note that @xmath49 in eq.(30 ) is simply @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 is the second legendre polynomial ) .",
    "the free energy @xmath64 will be a minimum provided the consistency equations for these order parameters are satisfied . with the aid of eqs.(24,25 ) , one can write the following equations : @xmath65 , \\ ] ] and @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 in eq.(34 ) is the ratio @xmath69 and it is a measure of the deviation from cylindrical symmetry . if @xmath68 is taken to be zero , the theory reduced to the maier - saupe mean field theory .",
    "now we would like to give the description of tsallis thermostatistics with its axioms below .",
    "tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) has been extensively used to investigate the concepts of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . in this context , it has been applied to various phenomena [ 17 ] and tt seems to be appropriate for the study of nonextensive systems . as mentioned above , we have choosen the nematic - isotropic transition as an application area of tt in earlier studies [ 11 - 13 ] and the present study would be the extensional study to investigate the nematic liquid crystals . in all of these earlier studies , we consider that the uniaxial nematic liquid crystals are formed by cylindrically symmetric molecules .",
    "however , we wonder in this study that if the mesophase could be formed by non - cylindrically symmetric molecules , how does the nonextensivity affect the nematic - isotropic transition ? therefore our starting point is luckhurst et al.s theory [ 10 ] which is a molecular field theory and assumes the molecules of the nematic liquid crystals to be non - cylindrical and we examine the effects of the nonextensivity on the nematic - isotropic transition by considering this molecular field theory .",
    "the understanding of the basic principles and properties of tt has gain fundamental importance . in this manner ,",
    "tsallis et al .",
    "have studied the role of the constraint within tt .",
    "tsallis proposed an entropy definition in 1988 [ 18 ] : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant , @xmath72 is the probabilty of the system in the @xmath73 microstate , @xmath40 is the total number of configurations and @xmath74 is called the entropic index whose meaning will be given below . in the limit @xmath75 ,",
    "the entropy defined in eq.(35 ) reduced to the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy . in other words , tt contains boltzmann - gibbs statistics as a special case with @xmath76 . as well known , bg statistics is a powerful one to study a variety of the physical systems",
    ". however , it fails for the systems which @xmath77 have long range interactions , @xmath78 have long range memory effects and @xmath79 evolve in multi - fractal space - time .",
    "the systems which has these properties is called  nonextensive  and if a system does obey these restrictions , bg statistics seems to be inappropriate and one might need a nonextensive formalism to study on the physical system",
    ".    it will be useful to write the pseudo - additivity entropy rule , @xmath80 which reflects the character of the entropic index @xmath74 and also of the nonextensivity . in this equation , @xmath81 and @xmath39",
    "are two independent systems . since all cases @xmath82 ( which is called nonnegativity property ) , @xmath83 , @xmath76 and @xmath84 , correspond to superadditivity , additivity and subadditivity respectively .",
    "because of some unfamiliar consequences of first two energy constraints discussed in [ 13,19 ] , tsallis et al .",
    "present the third internal energy constraint as follows : @xmath85 this choice is commonly considered to study physical systems and is denoted as the tsallis - mendes - plastino ( tmp ) choice .",
    "the optimization of tsallis entropy given by eq.(35 ) according to the third choice of the energy constraint results in @xmath86 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}}{% z_{q}^{(3)}}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ] therefore the @xmath74-expectation value of any observable is defined as @xmath88 where @xmath81 represents any observable quantity which commutes with hamiltonian . as can be expected , when @xmath76 , the @xmath74-expectation value of the observable reduces to the conventional one . at this stage ,",
    "the important point is to solve eq.(40 ) which is an implicit one , and tsallis et al .",
    "suggest two different approaches ;  @xmath89  and  @xmath90{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion $ ]  transformation .",
    "the nonextensivity , in fact , appears in systems where long range interactions and/or fractality exist , and such properties have been invoked in recent models of manganites [ 20,21 ] as well as in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "these properties are also appear in [ 22 ] where the role of the competition between different phases to the physical properties of these materials is emphasized .",
    "the formation of micro - clusters of competing phases , with fractal shapes , randomly distributed in the material is considered in [ 23,24 ] , and the role of long range interactions to phase segregation [ 25,26 ] .",
    "if we look at the recent studies in which tt is employed , we see also that the entropic index is frequently established from the dynamics of the system under consideration analytically .",
    "some of such studies are : boghosian et al.s study [ 27 ] for the incompressible navier - stokes equation in boltzmann lattice models , baldovin et al.s studies [ 28,29 ] at the edge of chaos for the logistic map universality class , oliveira et al. studies [ 20,21 ] on manganites .    according to these axioms of tt given above ,",
    "the order parameters are calculated by using eq.(40 ) instead of eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) .",
    "the exponential form of any function , say x , is given by @xmath91 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ] in tsallis thermostatistics . substituting this equation in the calculation ,",
    "eq.(40 ) is employed and then the self - consistent equations are solved to obtain the order parameters .",
    "the generalized free energy then follows within tt : @xmath92 -rt\\ln _ { q}(z_{q}),\\ ] ] where @xmath93 .",
    "now it is the time to give the results of application of tt to the luckhurst et al.s theory presented above .",
    "the first stage in our calculation is the identification of the transition from the uniaxial nematic phase to the isotropic phase .",
    "this may be accomplished for a given molecular symmetry by determining the value of @xmath94  at which the orientational free energy vanishes , provided there is no volume change at the transition .",
    "the results of such calculations are listed tables ( 1 - 3 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the transition temperatures , the critical values of order parameters @xmath49 and @xmath95 at the transition temperature and the entropy changes at the transition concerning @xmath96 for some values of @xmath74 .",
    "we can see immediately that increasing the entropic index increases @xmath97 and so decreases the nematic - isotropic transition temperature for constant @xmath98 .",
    "similar behaviour is also seen from tables ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) concerning @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "also we see from tables ( 1 - 3 ) that increasing the entropic index increases the order parameter @xmath101 at the transition for @xmath102 and @xmath100 .",
    "however there is a somewhat suprising result that as @xmath74 is increased , the secondary order parameter @xmath53 also increases at the transition for @xmath103 while this is not the case for @xmath96 , that is , the secondary order parameter decreases with increasing @xmath74 for @xmath104 .",
    "we also observe from the tables ( 1 - 3 ) that the entropy changes at the transition increases with increasing @xmath74 .    in fig.(1 ) , we illustrate the dependence of the order parameter @xmath105 and on reduced temperature for some @xmath74 values , with @xmath106 only . the results are plotted as a function of the reduced variable @xmath107  which is identical to the reduced temperature @xmath108 provided the coefficients @xmath35 are themselves independent of temperature .",
    "we observe that as @xmath74 increased , the transition becomes more markedly first - order .",
    "it is well known from [ 10 ] that the effect of introducing deviations from cylindrical symmetry is to lower the curves for @xmath109 and @xmath100 respectively , as well as changing their slopes .",
    "it is clear from fig.(1 ) that as @xmath74 is decreased , the similar behaviour is also seen , that is , the slope of the curve for @xmath106 decreases with increasing the entropic index @xmath74 . the similar behaviour could also expected for other @xmath68  values @xmath110 .",
    "the secondary order parameter @xmath111 is plotted as a function of @xmath49 , that is @xmath62 , in fig.(2 ) with @xmath99 for various values of the entropic index .",
    "these results exhibit an unusual behaviour , for the order parameter @xmath53  is observed to increase with increasing @xmath62  pass through a maximum and then decrease . it is interesting to note that as @xmath74 is decreased , the maximum value of the secondary order parameter assumes a higher value than those concerning lower value of @xmath74 .",
    "another important point is that maier - saupe theory gives a universal value of the @xmath49 at the transition temperature @xmath112 .",
    "however both luckhurst et al.s theory and the generalized form of the maier - saupe theory , including the present study , assume different values of this order parameter with changing @xmath68 and @xmath74 parameters .",
    "this fact is consistent with experiment in that experimental values of @xmath49 for various nematics assume in a range of @xmath113 [ 30 ] . while @xmath68 denotes the ratio @xmath69 , i.e. it is responsible from the deviations from the cylindrical symmetry , @xmath74 is a measure of the nonextensivity of the system .",
    "but it is interesting that they exhibit some similar behaviour about the critical value of the order parameter @xmath49 at the transition .    [",
