    "from the end of the sixth decade of the last century , a part of the mathematical community , has directed its attention to the study the so called _ dumbbell body or satellite _ in central gravity , see for instance morn @xcite , schechter @xcite , brereton and modi @xcite , beletsky @xcite , maciejewski et al .",

    "recall that a _ dumbbell body _ is a quite simple structure composed by two masses connected by a massless rod .",
    "it is assume that this object is moving around a planet whose gravity field is approximated by the field of the attracting center .",
    "in general , the distance between the two points masses is considered to be much smaller that the distance between the satellite s center of mass and the attracting center of mass .",
    "thus , it is common to neglect the influence of the attitude dynamics on the motion of the center of mass and treat it as an unperturbed keplerian one .",
    "rodnikov @xcite studied equilibrium positions of a weight on a cable fixed to a dumbbell  shaped space station moving along a circular geocentric orbit .",
    "this model is composed by two masses coupled by a weightless rod , while the cable is weightless and non - stretched .",
    "the equations of motion are stated when the motion is produced in a single plane and the center of mass of the system moves along a circular geocentric orbit .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium configurations of the system are obtained and the lyapunov stability of configurations for two situations , first when the station is composed of equal masses , second when masses at the ends of the station are different are analyzed .    for the `` dumbbells ",
    "load '' system with two unilateral connections , all relative equilibria on the circular keplerian orbit were established by munitsina @xcite .",
    "recall that a relative equilibria of the system is a point of the phase space giving an evolution which is a one  parameter orbit of the action of the symmetry group of the system .",
    "these results were interpreted for studying the relative equilibria for which both connections are stretched in geometrical terms .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the relative equilibria were stated .",
    "celletti and sidorenko @xcite investigated the dumbbell satellite s attitude dynamics , when the center of mass moves on a keplerian trajectory .",
    "they found a stable relative equilibrium position in the case of circular orbits which disappears as far as elliptic trajectories are considered .",
    "they replaced the equilibrium position by planar periodic motions and they proved this motion is unstable with respect to out - of - plane perturbations .",
    "they also gave some numerical evidences of the existence of stable spatial periodic motions .",

    "@xcite considered the motion of a dumbbell  shaped body in an attractive newtonian central field .",
    "they used the poincare s theory to determine the conditions for the existence of families of system periodic motions depending on the arising small parameter and passing into some stable radial steady  state motion of the unperturbed problem as the small parameter tends to zero .",
    "they also proved that , each of the radial relative equilibria generates one family of such periodic motions , for sufficiently small parameter values .",
    "furthermore , they studied the stability of the obtained periodic solutions in the linear approximation as well as these solutions were calculated up to terms of the first order in the small parameter .",

    "@xcite gave sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic solutions of the perturbed attitude dynamics of a rigid dumbbell satellite in a circular orbit .",

    "the pass trajectory of the mass center of the system is periodic and different from the classical one .",
    "if @xmath0 is equal to zero our solution coincides with the elliptical classical one .    finally , considering the motion in the satellite approximation we complete the classical theory , stating the following result .",
    "[ th2 ] the equations of motion in the satellite approximation can be reduced to beletsky s equation when @xmath0 is equal to zero .",

    "@xcite due to oblateness parameter .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the model description , the potential , the kinetic energy and the lagrangian function of the system . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the morphology of the equations of motion and the equation of the mass center of the system . in sections",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] we respectively provide proof of theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] .",
    "we remark that when @xmath1 is clear that the dynamics occurs on a plane , however when the coefficient @xmath2 is considered the effects of the gravitational potential are not the same for planes with different inclinations and a natural question is if there is an invariant plane for the dynamics .",
    "the answer of this fact is positive and it will be a key point in the proofs of our main result . in the appendix we provide a proof of this property .",
    "we assume that the dumbbell satellite is formed by massless rod of length @xmath3 with to masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 placed at its ends .",
    "let consider @xmath6 the center of mass of the two masses moving in a gravity field generated by an oblate body whose mass @xmath7 having mass center located at @xmath8 where the distance between @xmath8 and @xmath6 is @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider the orbital reference frame @xmath6xy with origin at the dumbbell s center , and the polar coordinates of the center are @xmath11 . while the rotation of the satellite relative to ray @xmath12 will be determined by an angle @xmath13 .",

    "see the appendix , and take the effect of the zonal harmonic up to @xmath2 , hence equation can be rewritten as    @xmath38    see @xcite for more details .",
    "if we assume that @xmath28 represent the unit of distance , @xmath24 is also the unit mass and denote @xmath39 by @xmath0 .",
    "we have that the potential experienced by the masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that    @xmath42    @xmath43    therefore the total potential @xmath44 can be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 denotes the gravity parameter associated to the oblate body .",
    "let the vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 be an orthogonal set of unitary vectors with @xmath47 corresponding to the direction from @xmath8 to @xmath6 .",

    "now let us go back to dumbbell s center motion in which we can be assumed that this motion follows a kepler s type orbit when the effect of oblateness parameter is absent ( @xmath89 ) .",
