    "a qcd - based operator - product - expansion ( ope ) formulation for treatment of inclusive heavy hadron decays has been developed in past years @xcite .",
    "the optical theorem tell us that the inclusive decay rates are related to the imaginary part of certain forward scattering amplitudes along the physical cut . since , based on the hypothesis of quark - hadron duality ,",

    ", it is very important to have a reliable estimate of the heavy hadron lifetimes within the ope framework and compare them with experiment .    in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "all bottom hadrons have the same lifetimes in the parton picture . with the advent of heavy quark effective theory , which gives a systematic way in expansion of the initial heavy hadron , and the ope approach for the analysis of inclusive weak decays",
    ", it is realized that the first nonperturbative correction to bottom hadron lifetimes starts at order @xmath5 .",

    "one possible reason for the discrepancy is that ( local ) quark - hadron duality may not work in the study of nonleptonic inclusive decay widths .",
    "another possibility is that some hadronic matrix elements of four - quark operators are probably larger than what naively expected so that the nonspectator effects of order @xmath10 may be large enough to explain the observed lifetime ratios .",
