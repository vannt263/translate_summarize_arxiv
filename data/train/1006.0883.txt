    "the motion of a fluid can be described either in the eulerian or lagrangian frame of reference . in case of fluid turbulence , the lagrangian point of view brought interesting and new insights on the small - scale structure and statistics ( see e.g. yeung @xcite , toschi and bodenschatz @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "these studies included intermittency of temporal velocity increments and accelerations @xcite or the geometry of particle tracks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , two - particle and multi - particle dispersion have been analysed and compared with classical predictions by batchelor @xcite and richardson @xcite .",
    "almost all of the experimental and numerical investigations in turbulent thermal convection have been conducted in the eulerian frame .",
    "this includes studies on the turbulent heat transfer and large - scale circulations @xcite as well as on small - scale structures and dynamics of thermal plumes @xcite .",
    "recently , first lagrangian laboratory experiments on convection were conducted in a closed cylindrical vessel @xcite and numerical simulations were carried out in cartesian slabs with periodic side walls and free - slip boundary conditions at the top and bottom @xcite .",
    "the focus of these studies was on the local variations of the heat transfer which can be measured along the trajectories of the lagrangian tracers . in the numerical studies",
    ", these results could be connected to the local tracer accelerations . in the laterally",
    "infinitely extended layer ( i.e. the configuration with periodic side walls ) , slightly less intermittent vertical accelerations @xmath5 were detected in comparison to the lateral ones , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this was manifested in the sparser tails of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath5 .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to take these numerical lagrangian studies to the next level .",
    "we report investigations in a closed cylindrical cell with no - slip boundary conditions at all walls .",
    "this is the characteristic setup for almost all laboratory experiments .",
    "it will allow for a closer comparison with the work by gasteuil _",
    "in addition , we want to explore systematically how the finite size of the cell affects the lagrangian dynamics , such as the long - time behaviour of the two - particle dispersion .",
    "the latter point is also motivated by recent eulerian studies , in which a systematic dependence of the turbulent heat transfer on the aspect ratio @xmath0 is found for small and moderate values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dependence is in line with morphological changes in the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) , e.g. from one - roll to multi - roll patterns , in the convection cell .",
    "our boundary conditions will differ from those in refs .",
    "this difference might also affect the statistics of the acceleration components .",
    "it is thus another open question if a different velocity boundary layer structure has an impact on the intermittency of lateral and vertical acceleration components .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the equations of motion , the numerical model and the tracer advection scheme for the non - uniform cylindrical mesh .",
    "section iii is focussed on the particle dynamics and local heat transfer followed by studies of the pair dispersion in section iv and the aspect ratio dependence of the acceleration statistics in section v. finally , we summarize our findings and give a brief outlook .",
    "we solve the boussinesq equations for rayleigh - bnard convection numerically with a second - order finite difference scheme in cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the equations are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ( kinematic ) pressure , @xmath11 the velocity field , @xmath12 the thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath13 the gravity acceleration .",
    "the velocity field has a no - slip boundary condition at all walls .",
    "the temperature field is isothermal at the top and bottom plates and adiabatic at the side wall . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we have chosen the dns grid such that the _ global _ maximum of the geometric mean of the grid spacings in @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16{r \\delta_{\\phi}\\delta_r\\delta_z}]\\ , , \\label{maxgrid}\\ ] ] satisfies the resolution threshold by grtzbach @xcite , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kolmogorov dissipation length which is calculated via the mean energy dissipation rate @xmath19 .",
    "the details are provided in tab.1 .",
    "the resolutions of the runs are exactly the same as in @xcite .",
    "note that the turbulence is strongly inhomogeneous with respect to the vertical direction @xmath15 .",
    "this results in amplitudes of the energy dissipation rate which are by orders of magnitude larger close to the plates than in the bulk .",
    "a local kolmogorov scale is therefore much larger in the bulk as in the boundary layers .",
    "it motivated us in @xcite to relate the grid spacing to @xmath20 rather than @xmath18 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters and their range of values in our numerical study are : the rayleigh number @xmath21 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the prandtl number @xmath22 and the aspect ratios @xmath23 between 1 and 12 .",

    "@xcite yielded a sensitive dependence of the pair dispersion on the initial pair separation .",

    "in addition it was found there that the intermediate evolution of the dispersion in thermal convection depends on the seeding height of the tracer pairs since convective turbulence is inhomogeneous in the vertical direction . here , we repeat these studies . in fig .  [",

    "finally , we report the probability density function ( pdf ) of acceleration components along three - dimensional trajectories . in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf_ak ] we compare data for three different rayleigh numbers with fixed aspect ratio @xmath44 . both lateral and vertical acceleration components show no systematic trend with @xmath1 .",
    "the stretched exponential form is similar to those reported in laboratory experiments @xcite and dns simulations of turbulent convection @xcite .    a critical issue of numerical and experimental lagrangian studies",
    " not only in turbulent convection  is the statistical convergence , which requires to determine , for example , a fourth - order moment , such as the flatness @xmath48 . in lagrangian turbulence , the situation becomes particularly problematic since the tails of the pdfs are found to be strongly scattered @xcite .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is also manifested in the scattered tails of the pdfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_ak ] although more than @xmath45 data points have been included . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfconv ] , we ran the simulation for significantly longer period such that the number of samples became one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the tails become less scattered and more extended with increasing number of samples .",
    "the data indicate that the convergence in the vertical direction is slower than in the lateral direction .",
    "nevertheless , the scatter for the fourth order moments remains so strong that the flatness is obtained with a big error bar only .",
    "the flatness is defined as @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath15 .",
    "we found that @xmath51 for @xmath52 samples .",
    "the dependence on the aspect ratio @xmath0 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_ax_az_gamma ] .",
    "it can be seen that the tails of the pdf of @xmath6 grow with increasing aspect ratio , which implies that less constrained lateral motion causes larger acceleration magnitudes .",
    "meandering of the tracers among different lsc rolls @xcite will probably contribute to larger amplitudes in the acceleration as well .",
    "interestingly , a similar but weaker trend holds for the vertical acceleration component as well .",
    "we have presented dns studies on the lagrangian tracer particle dynamics in turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection . the main objective of this work was to investigate how the finiteness of the cell size in convection impacts the motion , dispersion and acceleration of the tracer particles .",
    "we developed an interpolation scheme for the staggered computational mesh , which was used in the eulerian simulation .",
    "our interpolation scheme reproduces accurately the global heat transfer in the lagrangian frame @xmath53 , which matches the corresponding value in the eulerian frame @xmath54 .",
    "we detected however large fluctuations of @xmath55 about the mean value since the majority of the tracers is moving along the mean circulation path in the cell .",
    "our studies suggest that either a large number of particles or a very long time integration period are necessary for faster convergence of @xmath55 .",
    "the convergence is found to be slower for a non - uniform initial tracer seeding .    in the pair dispersion analysis",
    ", we confirmed the initial ballistic regime ( @xmath56 ) and a very short - range regime with @xmath33 which have also been found in other studies on convection @xcite and simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence in a periodic cube @xcite .",
    "the finite size of the convection cell suppresses the dispersion limit ; hence a taylor - like regime ( @xmath57 ) is absent for @xmath58 in our studies as opposed to @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelations of the vertical velocity component are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "this is in line with @xcite and seems to be associated with the characteristic structures  the thermal plumes  present in convection .",
    "these structures have a strong influence on the vertical tracer motion .",
    "in particular they cause the reversals in the tracer tracks , namely when a particle hits the top or bottom plates . while we did not observe a rayleigh - number - dependence of the acceleration statistics , a systematic dependence of the pdfs of the acceleration components on @xmath0 was obtained .",
    "to conclude , the basic lagrangian properties we studied in the present work agree qualitatively with those in previous studies , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the additional variation of the aspect ratio is in line with changes in the large - scale circulation in the convection cell , which affects the lagrangian tracer dispersion and acceleration .",
    "our studies complemented the only existing lagrangian laboratory experiment on convection by gasteuil _",
    "we could confirm qualitatively some results obtained in their experiments .",
    "further experimental and numerical studies in the large aspect ratio regime are desirable and necessary .",
