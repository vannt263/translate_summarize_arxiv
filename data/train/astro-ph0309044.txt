    "dwarf galaxies are considered the building blocks of the hierarchical merging process which is thought to be the fundamental mechanism for the formation of large galaxies . among dwarf galaxies ,",
    "dwarf ellipticals are the most common type of galaxy in the nearby universe ( ferguson & binggeli  1994 , hereafter fb94 ) .",
    "hence , the comprehension of their structural and evolutionary characteristics is a major task of modern cosmology .    a characteristic of many de is an enhancement of the surface brightness in a small central region , called _ nucleus _ (",
    "such feature defines the sub - class of nucleated dwarf elliptical ( de , n ) .",
    "the observed nuclei have surface brightness profiles similar to globular clusters , they seem to share with globulars the same general _ surface brightness - absolute magnitude _ relation and their luminosity function overlaps the luminosity range covered by globular clusters ( fb94 , durrell 1997 ) . hence , the origin of de , n nuclei is generally reconduced to two possible mechanisms , both related with massive star cluster : i.e. ( a ) the decay of the orbit of a pre - existing globular toward the tip of the galactic potential well , driven by dynamical friction , or ( b ) the _ in situ _ formation of a giant cluster from gas fallen to the center of the galaxy ( see durrell 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the capture hypothesis is more appealing to explane faint nuclei , while the brightest ones may be better understood within the second scenario . de nuclei may be also related with the ultracompact dwarf galaxies ( ucd ) recently discovered in the fornax cluster ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2003 ) . in summary ,",
    "the phenomenon of de nucleation is far from being well understood and it is subject of continuous investigation ( see , e.g. stiavelli et al.(2001 ) and references therein ) .",
    "a local example would certainly provide a deeper insight of the phenomenon , but the only acclaimed case in the local group is m  32 , a companion of the andromeda galaxy whose stellar content may be studied in some detail only with hst ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) .    on the other hand , the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) is the most nearby galactic satellite and since its discovery many authors suggested and discussed the hypothesis that the associated massive globular cluster m  54 is the nucleus of sgr ( sarajedini & layden 1995 , bassino & muzzio 1995 , layden & sarajedini 2000 , hereafter ls00 ) .",
    "if the presently observed sgr dsph is the relic of a previous de , n it may provide an excellent local testbed to study the nucleation process .",
    "hence the detailed study of its inner regions may have valuable spin - offs in this field .",
    "it is well known that the sgr galaxy hosts a composite stellar population with stars spanning a pretty large range of ages ( from @xmath01 to @xmath110 gyr ) and metallicities ( from [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.5 to [ fe / h]@xmath20.0 ) ( monaco et al . 2002 , hereafter pap - i , ls00 , monaco et al .",
    "2003 , bellazzini et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "however its stellar content is dominated by a quite metal - rich population ( @xmath3\\simeq -0.4/-0.6 $ ] ) with an age of @xmath4 gyr ( ls00 , pap - i ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of sgr shows the typical features of an old metal - rich population with a clearly defined red clump of he - burning stars and a cool red giant branch ( rgb ) . on the other",
    "hand m  54 is a quite old and metal poor globular cluster ( ls00 ) with an extended blue horizontal branch and a steep rgb .",
    "therefore , the evolved stars of the two systems may be easily discriminated on the cmd to study the respective spatial distributions .    in pap - i",
    "we presented a large photometric database containing position and photometry of @xmath5490,000 sources down to @xmath6 in a @xmath7 deg@xmath8 field centered on m  54 . from this sample we selected , on the basis of the cmd morphology , stars representative of m  54 and of the sgr dominant population from the pap - i database .",
    "both selected samples are composed only of rgb stars and have the same limiting magnitude .",
    "hence , according to the evolutionary flux theory ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) they approximately trace the same fraction of the total light of each system . for both samples we computed the star counts density profile .",
    "since star counts are proportional to luminosity ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) , we can convert the projected star density ( n / area ) into the surface brightness : @xmath9 where the value of the constant c is obtained by fitting the radial profile of m  54 with a king model ( king 1962 , using the structural parameters tabulated in trager et al .",
    "1995 ) and normalizing the central surface brightness to the value reported in the literature , @xmath10  mag / arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "the obtained surface brightness radial profiles are plotted on the left panel of figure 1 , as well as the model used to obtain the normalization .",
    "it can be appreciated that the model is a pretty good representation of the profile of m  54 ( assuming that the difference at r@xmath11 from the center of m  54 are due to incompleteness effect ) . as can be seen ,",
    "also the sgr s sample shows a quite sharp central structure ( hereafter ns ) .",
    "we estimate the integrated magnitude of ns to be @xmath12 , and the surface brightness of sgr at the core radius of the main body to be @xmath13  mag / arcsec@xmath8 ( using the model computed by majewski et al .",
    "these values place ns exactly in the locus occupied by de , n in figure 1 of drinkwater et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( surface brightness of the envelope _",
    "vs _ core luminosity ) .    is m  54 or ns the nucleus of sgr ?",
    "are m  54 and ns part of the same structure ? as can be seen in the right panels of figure 1 , a good match of the ns surface brightness profile can only be obtained with a king model having a tidal radius larger than the one of m  54 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms that the two distributions are incompatible each other .",
    "we conclude that m  54 and ns do not share the same radial profile .",
    "moreover m  54 is a metal poor globular cluster and its integrated colors are bluer than the sgr field , while galactic nuclei usually have colors similar to that of the surrounding galaxy field ( fb94 ) , even if a few nuclei bluer than the field do exist ( durrell 1997 ) . on the other hand , of course",
    ", ns has the same color of the surrounding galaxy .",
    "moreover , if m  54 is the nucleus of sgr , the difference in the central surface brightness of the nucleus with respect to the main body is @xmath14  mag / arcsec@xmath8 , while none of the 5 de , n analysed by geha et al.(2002 ) and at most one of the 14 analysed by stiavelli et al.(2001 ) show such a large difference . a lower @xmath15 value , more typical of de , n , value is obtained for ns .",
    "while m  54 is generally considered the nucleus of sgr , we now suggest the possibility that ns is the actual nucleus of sgr and that m  54 has spiraled into the potential well of the nucleus . if this scenario ( which needs further investigations ) is correct , galactic nuclei were finally demonstrated to be a distinct class of object with respect to globular clusters .",
