    "they used 7 of the then available four - image lens systems to claim detection of substructure amounting to a total mass of @xmath5 of the lens galaxy mass .",
    "however , this interpretation was challenged as flux anomalies could arise from alternative sources , such as absorption , scattering , or scintillation by the interstellar medium of the lens galaxy , or by higher order harmonics in the ellipsoidal models used to fit lens systems , or stellar microlensing  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , the surface mass density in substructure as judged from simulations seems to be lower than that required by gravitational lensing , at least within the einstein radius which probes primarily the inner parts of halos  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also hard to reproduce the observed statistics on cusp violations with substructure  @xcite .",
    "this argues against substructure as a primary cause of anomalous flux ratios .",
    "nonetheless , there is good evidence in favour of substructure , and , in some cases , visible substructure can be identified .",
    "one of the gravitational lens systems with a flux ratio anomaly is the radio - loud quadruple class b2045 + 265 discovered by @xcite .",
    "recent deep _ hubble space telescope _ and _ keck _ imaging of this system by @xcite have revealed the presence of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy g2",

    "it seems that visible substructure may well be responsible for some of the flux ratio anomalies .",
    "in addition , there have been striking observational developments nearer to home .",

    "such ultra - faint objects are only detectable nearby , and so would be  to all intents and purposes  dark at the typical redshifts of strong lenses .",
    "all this suggests that it is worth re - examining the effects of substructure on strong lenses . in this paper , we answer the following questions .",
    "given what we know about the satellite populations , how frequently might we expect anomalous flux ratios for elliptical and spiral galaxies ?",
    "if luminous satellite galaxies represent the bright and massive end of a predominantly faint population of objects , how frequently might we expect to attribute flux ratio anomalies to visible objects ?",

    "the paper is arranged as follows . in  2 ,",
    "models of elliptical and spiral galaxies are briefly introduced , together with their satellite galaxy populations . in  3 , the frequency with which anomalous flux ratios occur is shown to depend primarily on the scalelength of the satellite distribution , the mass model used for the satellites and the total mass in substructure , while depending only weakly on how the mass is distributed between satellites .",

    "a point source has one image if it is outside both caustics , three if it is inside the outer caustic , and five if it is inside the astroid caustic .",

    "for example , even with plummer satellites , a mass of @xmath145 is needed for 20 % of quadruplets to show anomalous flux ratios for a typical elliptical galaxy , rising to @xmath146 for 50 % .",
    "lenses that are edge - on spiral galaxies with maximum discs ( like the milky way ) are more resistant to flux changes by satellites , so the mass in satellites and substructure has to be roughly a factor of 3 times as great for the same proportion of quads to be affected . to obtain anything like the apparent abundance of anomalous flux ratios , then the scalelength of the substructure has to be different to what is known for the milky way satellites .",
    "whether the flux ratios in a lens system are affected by satellites is sensitive to the total mass in satellites , but more weakly dependent of how this mass is apportioned between them . for plummer model satellites , the probability that a given satellite changes a flux ratio increases with its mass only slightly faster than linearly , at least when its mass is between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "for example , satellites of mass @xmath149 are only responsible for the causing @xmath150 more flux ratio anomalies than those of mass @xmath151",
    ". for hernquist model satellites , more massive ones seem no more efficient ( per unit mass ) at changing fluxes ; indeed , more massive dwarfs , being more prone to tidal disruption , might even be _ less _ efficient than lighter , more compact ones .",
    "one interesting consequence is that , if matter in dark satellites is not predominantly in the most massive ones , then the contribution of the most massive satellite galaxies to flux ratio anomalies should not be predominant .    in the light of this",
    ", the fact that so many anomalous flux ratios systems have optically identified substructure seems at outset surprising .",
    "there seem to be two possible explanations .",
    "first , the visible substructure may have been wrongly identified as the cause , whereas dark substructure may be the true culprit .",
    "a large dwarf galaxy may by chance be projected close to the einstein radius , whereas unrelated dark substructure may be the major cause of the anomaly .",
    "second , visible satellites may be more concentrated than their dark cousins , a physical effect that may naturally arise from baryon condensation .",
    "compression factors causing an enhancement of the central density by a factor of 10 in bright satellites seem to be ample to give a satisfactory explanation of the observed statistics . nonetheless , such high compression factors are probably implausible except for the largest satellite galaxies .",
    "this seems to be in accord with the results of @xcite , who found that including baryons in numerical simulations did not help in reconciling simulation results with the statistics of anomalous flux ratios .    finally , we remark that the likelihood that flux ratios are affected depends on the ellipticity of the main lens galaxy , but this dependence is much stronger in quads than doublets .",
    "this is a consequence of high magnification images being more easily affected by a dwarf galaxy than low magnification ones .",
    "quads are more highly magnified than doublets ( the disc triplets of spirals are in between ) , and changing the ellipticity of the main galaxy changes the typical magnification of quads more than it changes that of doublets .",
    "generally , the greater the ellipticity the less the effect of satellite galaxies . for example , a given mass @xmath78 of dwarf satellites around a typical edge - on maximum - disc spiral galaxy is significantly less likely to change image flux ratios than @xmath78 around a typical elliptical galaxy , even though the spiral is less massive than the elliptical .",
