    "it is widely accepted to consider the measurements in liquid helium near @xmath1transition point @xmath16 as a crucial test of validity of the theoretical predictions for the critical exponents , since these measurements are done with a high degree of accuracy much closer to the critical point than in any other experiments or numerical simulations . in particular",
    ", it is believed that accurate experimental measurements of specific heat @xmath0 of liquid helium very close to the @xmath1-transition point in zero gravity conditions ( in space )  @xcite provide a convincing evidence of overall correctness of the perturbative rg approach .",
    "the aim of our paper is to show that this conclusion is not unambiguous , since these experimental data as well as those of the superfluid fraction of liquid helium can be equally well or even better interpreted by a completely different set of critical exponents provided by our recently developed theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been found in  @xcite that fits of experimental data for a wide range of reduced temperatures @xmath17 below @xmath5 by using two slightly different ansatz , @xmath18 and @xmath19 biased by the rg theoretical value of the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath20 , provide well consistent values of the specific heat exponent @xmath21 in a good agreement with the value @xmath22 of the variational perturbative theory  @xcite as well as in a worse , but still acceptable , agreement with more recent estimates @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "apart from the exponent @xmath25 , some other quantities have been determined and compared with the rg values in  @xcite .",
    "however , the agreement is not so good to conclude that any theoretical approach , which does not agree with the perturbative rg , is wrong . in particular ,",
    "the experimental quantity @xmath26 is @xmath27 , whereas the recent rg calculation ( ref .",
    "63 in  @xcite ) yields @xmath28 .",
    "we have found that the measured data of @xmath0 @xcite can be well reproduced also by an ansatz of the form @xmath29 with fixed exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with the idea that specific heat can have a logarithmic correction , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the power  like singularity is recovered at @xmath32 .",
    "note that in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "( 60 ) there ) an ordinary term @xmath33 is related the behaviour of the correlation function within the range of wave vectors @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the correlation length , whereas the logarithmic term can appear due to the contribution of the region @xmath36 . in this aspect",
    ", the ratio @xmath37 in  ( [ mans ] ) can be varied in a wide range of values .    from the raw data of  @xcite given in  @xcite we have produced the set of bin averaged data points by dividing each decade of the reduced temperature @xmath38 in 10 segments of equal width when looking in the logarithmic scale .",
    "one binned data point has been obtained by an averaging over @xmath0 and @xmath2 values within one segment , and only the data for the smallest @xmath2 values within a twice wider interval @xmath39 have been merged together into one bin to reduce the statistical error . in our binning ,",
    "the averaged data points come as close to @xmath5 as @xmath40 , whereas those given in  @xcite extend only to @xmath41 .",
    "the percent deviations from the least  squares fits to  ( [ mans ] ) and  ( [ vinu ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "the upper picture corresponds to  ( [ mans ] ) with fixed exponents @xmath42 and @xmath31 and coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , whereas the lower one represents the fit to  ( [ vinu ] ) with exponents @xmath47 ( fit parameter ) and @xmath20 ( fixed ) and coefficients listed in tab .",
    "ii of  @xcite . as in some fits made in  @xcite ,",
    "we have assigned the error bars @xmath48 to the bin averages which originally had smaller errors . in this way",
    ", we have reduced the impact of these data points , located at relatively large values of the reduced temperature @xmath2 , where the asymptotic ansatz  ( [ mans ] ) is not very accurate . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fits ] , both fits are almost identical in the whole range of the reduced temperatures .",
    "the fit with our exponents ( top ) is slightly worse at the largest @xmath2 values .",
    "it can be well understood , since ( to ensure the stability of the fit parameters ) we have neglected the subleading correction of the kind @xmath49 included in the other ansatz  ( [ vinu ] ) . besides , our fit is even slightly better at the smallest @xmath2 values : the mean percent deviation for 10 smallest @xmath2 values is @xmath50 in our case of  ( [ mans ] ) and @xmath51 in the case of  ( [ vinu ] ) .",
    "these deviations are reduced to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , when shifting the @xmath54 values by @xmath55  nk within the experimental error bars  @xcite .",

    "our analysis of the experimental data for the superfluid fraction , made in sec .",
    "[ sec : supfl ] , gives one more argument : it suggests that the exponent @xmath14 is remarkably larger than @xmath58 . according to the known scaling relation @xmath59  @xcite , the exponent @xmath25",
    "then should be remarkably more negative than @xmath60 .",
    "it well coincides with the measured data  @xcite in the whole range of the reduced temperatures only if the pure power is perturbed by a logarithmic correction , as proposed by ansatz  ( [ mans ] ) .",
    "considering @xmath25 as a fit parameter in  ( [ mans ] ) , we obtain a value @xmath61 , which is quite close to our theoretical prediction @xmath62 .",
    "the small systematic deviation could be caused by the error of the asymptotic ansatz  ( [ mans ] ) at the largest @xmath2 values .",
    "this problem can not be reliably solved by adding more correction terms or by narrowing the range of the fit , since the minimum of the @xmath63 for such fits is very shallow , i.  e. , the results become poorly defined .",
    "alternatively , we have fit the data within a moving window @xmath64 $ ] of the reduced temperatures to the simplest possible ansatz @xmath65 where @xmath66 corresponds to the @xmath67th bin averaged data point .",
    "it yields the effective exponent @xmath4 , where @xmath2 belongs to the considered interval . for convenience , we have defined it as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the minimal and @xmath70 is the maximal @xmath2 value in the interval . by this method , the result converges to the true value of @xmath25 at @xmath71 irrespective to the error of the asymptotic ansatz at finite @xmath2 .",
    "it works also when the logarithmic correction is present , only in this case the convergence is very slow , like @xmath72 at @xmath71 .",
    "the only problem is that this method requires that the measurement errors both for @xmath0 and @xmath2 remain sufficiently small when approaching @xmath5 .",

    "the horizontal dot  dashed line indicates the @xmath25 value @xmath76 found in  @xcite , whereas the dashed curve shows schematically a behaviour expected from  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   vs @xmath73 estimated by fitting the bin averaged data within @xmath74 $ ] to the ansatz  ( [ eq : simplest ] ) with unbiased ( left ) and shifted according to @xmath75 ( right ) values of the reduced temperatures .",
    "the horizontal dot  dashed line indicates the @xmath25 value @xmath76 found in  @xcite , whereas the dashed curve shows schematically a behaviour expected from  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ alfeff ] the results for @xmath77 depending on @xmath73 ( with our exponent @xmath56 ) obtained by using the unbiased values of @xmath66 ( left ) , as well as the shifted values @xmath78 ( for the same sets of measured points ) corresponding to @xmath75 ( right ) . in spite of the large error bars , these plots show certain trend , where the effective exponent @xmath4 tends to decrease below the ( rg ) value @xmath76 found in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have verified that the same trend is observed in both cases when only the odd and only the even raw measurements ( the original values listed in  @xcite ) are used .",
    "hence , we can not exclude any striking scenario .",
    "for instance , @xmath4 could converge to our asymptotic value @xmath42 , as indicated by dashed lines , particularly , if we allow a small shift in @xmath54 values ( right picture ) within the experimental error bars .",
    "however , such a behaviour would mean that the logarithmic correction is absent , since the convergence is rather fast .",
    "it would imply also that the estimation of @xmath25 from the fit over the whole measured range is not valid : formally , such a fit looks good , but it effectively ignores the systematic deviations at the smallest @xmath2 values where the error bars are larger .    due to the experimental errors ,",
    "the results of our analysis of the effective exponent are not conclusive , they only point to a possible scenario . from an intuitive point of view",
    ", it does not seem plausible that such a remarkable change in the behaviour of the system could take place at so small reduced temteratures ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , since the deviations from the asymptotic scaling law are caused by the corrections to scaling , an essential parameter is @xmath73 rather than @xmath2 , and the values of @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ alfeff ] are not so extremely small .",
    "besides , the critical region , where an asymptotic ansatz is valid , can be as narrow as @xmath79 even in a simple mean field model .",
    "an example is given in  @xcite ( p.  75 ) .",
    "from this point of view , it is possible that the deviations in fig .",
    "[ alfeff ] represent a real physical effect and not an artifact . on the other hand , random deviations in fig .",
    "[ fits ] too often are as large as @xmath80 standard deviations or even larger , therefore the unusual behaviour of @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ alfeff ] can be ascribed also as an artifact .",
    "here we discuss the experimental data for the superfluid fraction @xmath81 in liquid @xmath82 .",
    "it decreases asymptotically ( at @xmath71 ) as @xmath83 .",
    "it is believed ( see  @xcite and references therein ) that the exponent @xmath84 is equal to the correlation length exponent @xmath14 for the 3d @xmath85 model . in  @xcite , the superfluid fraction of @xmath86 measured in  @xcite has been discussed with an aim to compare the experimentally observed behaviour at the temperatures closest to @xmath5 with our theoretical prediction @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "the data listed in  @xcite allow a more precise comparison . for this purpose , first we have fit these data to the asymptotic ansatz @xmath88 including two corrections to scaling .",
    "similar fits over the whole measured range @xmath89 $ ] have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "note that at @xmath90 , used in  @xcite , the second order correction reduces to the analytical one , and  ( [ ansatz ] ) differs from the ansatz of  @xcite only by a remainder term of higher order .",
    "the overall fits discussed in  @xcite yield @xmath10 in agreement with the rg prediction and in disagreement with our value @xmath15 . however , these fits look really good only within @xmath91 $ ] , whereas remarkable systematic deviations appear at smaller @xmath2 values .",
    "this phenomenon was discussed in  @xcite and no reasonable explanation was found .",
    "in particular , the effect of gravity is negligible in these experiments  @xcite and the @xmath92  nk uncertainty in @xmath54 also does not explain these systematic deviations .",
    "our theory  @xcite provides an explanation .",
    "first , the data can not be well fit within the whole measured range @xmath89 $ ] simply because the critical region , where the asymptotic expansion in @xmath2 powers is valid , is much narrower than @xmath93 .",
    "second , the data can be well fit to  ( [ ansatz ] ) with our exponents @xmath87 and @xmath56 within a reduced range @xmath7 $ ] , which means that the measured data for @xmath94 are not anomalous , but the region of validity of  ( [ ansatz ] ) is as narrow as @xmath95 . the percent deviations from the least  squares fits within @xmath7 $ ] with our ( left ) and rg ( right ) exponents are shown in fig .",

    "although the opinion dominates in publications that the perturbative rg theory is strongly confirmed by very accurate measurements of the specific heat and the superfluid fraction in liquid helium near the @xmath1transition point , our current analysis shows that these experimental data can be well understood and interpreted also within our recently developed theory  @xcite .    in summary",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "the critical exponents of the perturbative rg theory look preferable from a point of view that all measured data points must be necessarily fit on one curve and no logarithmic corrections are normally expected . however",
    ", if we allow the logarithmic correction to specific heat @xmath0 , our theory also provides a good fit of @xmath0 data for the whole measured range .",
    "our fit then is slightly worse at the largest reduced temperatures @xmath105 and better at the smallest ones @xmath106 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cp ] , the existence of the logarithmic correction is partly supported by our estimation of the exponent @xmath14 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : supfl ] ) , as well as by some general argument .",
    "the analysis of the effective exponent @xmath77 indicates that the behaviour of @xmath0 could be remarkably changed very close to @xmath5 , in such a way that the true asymptotic singularity is power  like ( without the logarithmic correction ) with the exponent which more probably is closer to our value @xmath107 than to the ( rg ) value @xmath76 obtained in  @xcite .",
    "however , this effect can be ascribed also as an artifact caused by the measurement errors .",
    "further improvement of the experimental accuracy for @xmath6 would be very helpful to clarify this question .",
    "3 .   as compared to the rg exponents , our critical exponents are better consistent with the closest to @xmath5 data ( @xmath108 $ ] ) for the superfluid fraction ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ rhofits ] and  [ nueff ] ) .",
    "a self consistent estimation in this case yields @xmath104 in agreement with our theoretical prediction @xmath109 .",
    "since the fit over the whole measured range ( @xmath89 $ ] ) in no case is really good , we argue that our way of estimation is preferable .",
