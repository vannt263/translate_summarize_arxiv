    "quaternary rare earth transition metal phosphide oxides with the tetragonal zrcusias structure @xcite are known for more than twenty years@xcite .",
    "numerous quaternary phosphide oxides have been reported , including the actinoidand copper - containing compounds uocup,@xcite thocup @xciteas well as the series of lanthanoid ( ln ) compounds lnofep@xcite , lnorup@xcite , lnocop@xcite , lnoosp , lnoznp@xcite and lnomnp@xcite .",
    "however , most of interests are limited to the synthesization and structural analysis , only few physical properties have been investigated for this compound series . because of open - shell structure and electronic correlation of 3d electrons , the zrcusias type transition metal phosphide oxides are expected to display interesting magnetic and electronic phenomena . with the same crystal structure ,",
    "the different groundstates including antiferromagnetic insulator @xcite , semiconductor and metal @xcitehave been found in the zrcusias type compounds .",
    "moreover , laofep @xcite has been found to be a type ii superconductor with @xmath0 of 3.2~6.5 k , which leads to renewed interest in studying physical properties in this class of materials .",
    "later , @xmath0 around 26 k has been found in f - doped @xciteand sr - doped @xcite laofeas .",
    "very recently , up to @xmath0=55 k was reached in lno@xmath1f@xmath2feas through replacement of la by ce@xcite , pr@xcite , nd@xcite , sm@xcite , and gd @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic kondo lattice systems found in ce - based phosphide oxides ceotp ( t = ru , os)@xcite also attract much attentions .    recently , a new compound laonip with zrcusias structure has been reported by watanabe _ _ et al.__@xcite , and it has also been synthesized by tegel _ _ et al.__@xcite with different experimental method . it has been identified as a superconductor with a critical temperature @xmath0 of 3 and 4.3 k , respectively .",
    "superconductivity was also found in laonias and lao@xmath1f@xmath2nias@xcite .",
    "laonip is the first nickel phosphide oxide and the second superconducting compound in laomp(m = transition metal ) .",
    "it seems that the superconductivity may be a common phenomena in this family .",
    "although this @xmath0 is lower than that of the copper oxides , because of possible different underlying mechanism , the discovery of superconductivity in the new material systems can provide valuable knowledge for understanding of superconduction and for finding another superconductor .",
    "thus , it is crucial to clarify the underlying mechanism of novel superconductivity in this series of compounds . whereas the understanding of electronic structure especially the fermi surface character is a basic step to obtain insight into the superconductivity mechanism .    in present calculation",
    ", we perform the systematic investigation for laonip based on density functional theory .",
    "the detailed structural parameters , electronic structures and fermi surfaces were given .",
    "the bonding properties are also discussed in combination with the concept of two - dimensional ( 2d ) building blocks and a bader analysis of the charge density . the band decomposed charge density is also provided to analyze the orbital character of each fermi surface .",
    "the present calculations have been performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) code @xcite within projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method , @xcite general gradient approximations ( gga ) @xcitewere used in the present calculations .",
    "the la(@xmath3 ) , ni(@xmath4 ) , p(@xmath5 ) , o(@xmath6 ) are treated as valence states . to ensure enough convergence ,",
    "the energy cutoff was chosen to be 600 ev , and the brillouin zone was sampled with a mesh of @xmath7 _ k _ points generated by the scheme of monkhorst - pack @xcite .",
    "a first order methfessel - paxton method with @xmath8 was used for relaxation .",
    "the crystal cell and internal parameters were optimized using the conjugate gradient method until the total forces on each ion less than 0.01 ev / ",
    ". then density of states ( dos ) calculations were performed using the tetrahedron method with the blchl corrections@xcite .",
    "the fermi surfaces and 3d charge density iso - surfaces have been drawn by _ _",
    "laonip crystallizes in the tetragonal zrcusias structure ( space group @xmath9 ) with the ni atom at 2a ( 0.75 , 0.25 , 0 ) , o at 2b ( 0.75 , 0.25 , 0.5 ) , la at 2c ( 0.25 , 0.25 , @xmath10 ) and p at 2c(0.25 , 0.25 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "it has a layered structure composed of an alternating stack of lao and nip block .",
    "the crystal structure is therefore rather simple with eight atoms ( two formula units ) in the unit cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strucure ] .",
    "lanthanum is eightfold coordinated by four oxygen and four phosphorus atoms .",
    "the nickel atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by four phosphorus atoms , forming a distorted tetrahedra with two different p - ni - p angles.@xcite and they also have four neighboring nickel atoms within the same layer .",

    "the experimental results are very consistent with each other .",
    "the present calculation is also in agreement with experiment , which indicates that the calculation is accurate .",
    "the slight difference between experiment and calculation may be induced by the fact that the lda / gga calculation can not describe the electronic correlation between 3d electrons of ni atom accurately .",
    "it should be noticed that the electronic structure @xciteand magnetic properties @xcite in case of laofeas are very sensitive to small change of internal coordinates , as shown in ref .  .",
    "it seems that in order to give a more reasonable description , further calculation including the electronic correlation should be performed .",
    ".[tab : table1]comparison of experimental and calculated crystallographic parameters of laonip . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      now , let s turn our attention to band structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] , the characteristic feature of band structures is the strongly pronounced two dimensionality along @xmath12-z and a - m .",
    "we observe four bands across the fermi energy , which have been indicated in the figure with different colors . the corresponding fermi surface in the first brillouin zone",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] . due to the two - dimensional electronic structure ,",
    "all fermi surfaces are cylindrical - like sheets parallel to the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the first sheet is hole cylinder centered along r - x whereas the other three are electron cylinders centered along the a - m high symmetry line .",
    "such a series of fermi surfaces are different from the results of laofep @xcite and laofeas@xcite , where five bands across the fermi level with four of them being cylindrical - like sheets(two electron cylinders along a - m and the other two hole - like cylinders along @xmath12-z direction ) and the other one being a three - dimensional hole pocket along @xmath12-z .",
    "the absence of distorted sphere fermi surface sheet suggests the two dimensionality of band structure in laonip is more pronounced than the case of laofepn .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that ni@xmath14 ( 3d@xmath15 ) contribute two more electrons than fe@xmath14 in laofepn , nickel based system has relatively higher carrier density and the hole bands tend to be filled .",
    "thus , three - dimensional hole pocket disappeared and electron bands dominate the conductivity .",
    "this is also been evidenced by recent experiment @xcite , in which they found that the charge carriers of laonias are dominantly electron - type .",

    "[ fig : band_charg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chg_top ] , which also suggests that the orbital component is different . from the shape of iso - surface",
    ", we can speculate that the band _ a _ is made up of ni-@xmath16 and weakly mixture with @xmath17 orbit , which may be built with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in case of the band _ d _ , the ni orbit is mainly contributed by @xmath20 and the states of p atom exhibit a @xmath21 orbital character .",
    "it seems that the orbital component of band _ b _ and _ c _ is more complicated than _ a _ and _ d_. combined with different orbital picture , we can deduce the 3d orbital character of _ c _ is mostly contribute by @xmath22 and maybe some component of @xmath20 . whereas the band _ b _ may be mixed with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the states of p are similar to _",
