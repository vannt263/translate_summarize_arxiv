    "the system formed in nucleus - nucles ( aa ) collisions at lhc will provide further insight into the dynamics of the deconfined state of nuclear matter .",
    "there are also interesting effects anticipated for the initial state of the incoming nuclei related to shadowing of nuclear parton distributions and the space - time picture of the interaction .",
    "these should be studied in the more `` clean '' environment of a proton - nucleus collision .",
    "the initial - state effects constitute a baseline for calculation of the density of particles at all rapidities and affect therefore also high-@xmath0 particle suppression and jet quenching , as well as the total multiplicity .    both soft and relatively high-@xmath0 , @xmath1 gev / c , particle production in pa at lhc energies probe the low-@xmath2 gluon distribution of the target nucleus at moderate scales , @xmath3 , and is therefore mainly influenced by nuclear shadowing . in the glauber - gribov theory @xcite ,",
    "shadowing at low-@xmath2 is related to diffractive structure functions of the nucleon , which are studied at hera .",
    "the space - time picture of the interaction is altered from a longitudinally ordered rescattering at low energies , to a coherent interaction of the constituents of the incoming wave - functions at high energy .",
    "shadowing affects both soft and hard processes .",
    "calculation of gluon shadowing was performed in our recent paper @xcite , where gribov approach for the calculation of nuclear structure functions was used .",
    "the schwimmer model was used to account for higher - order rescatterings .",
    "the gluon diffractive distributions are taken from the most recent experimental parameterizations @xcite .",
    "shadowing will lead to a suppression both at mid- and forward rapidities in p+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : r_pa ] . we have plotted the curves for two distinct kinematical scenarios of particle production ; one - jet kinematics which may be well motivated for particle production at @xmath5 gev / c and two - jet kinematics that apply for high-@xmath0 particle producion .",
    "the uncertainty in the curves is due to uncertainty in the parameterization of gluon diffractive distribution functions .",
    "cronin effect is not included in the curves of fig .  [",
    "fig : r_pa ] .",
    "we estimate it to be a 10% effect at these energies .    in fig .",
