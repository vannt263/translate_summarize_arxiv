    "mirror symmetry in @xmath0 supersymmetric affine quiver gauge theories in three dimensions have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in the type iib picture , these theories arise as world volume gauge theories on coincident d3 branes wrapping @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath3 being a compact direction  with certain special @xmath4-bps boundary conditions at the two ends . in type iia , these can be obtained as world volume theories on coincident d2 branes with parallel d6 branes ( and possibly a o6 plane ) wrapping a transverse ale ( asymptotically locally euclidean ) space .",
    "the m - theory lift of this type iia scenario therefore involves coincident m2 branes probing a product of ale spaces in the transverse direction with appropriate g - fluxes .",
    "as is evident from the type iia description , higgs branches of such theories arise as moduli spaces of instantons for classical gauge groups on ale spaces @xcite .",
    "aside from other interesting features , such theories provide a rich laboratory for studying dualities in supersymmetric qfts .",
    "mirror symmetry , a particularly important duality for @xmath5 theories in three dimensions , acts by simply exchanging the coulomb and the higgs branches of a pair of theories .",
    "it is a classic example of a ir duality which involves two or more theories with completely different uv description flowing to the same superconformal point in the ir .",
    "recent progress in localization techniques @xcite has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study such dualities by computing rg - independent supersymmetric observables @xmath6 on both sides of the duality and checking that the results agree . in particular ,",
    "partition function on a round sphere turns out to be an extremely effective tool for studying dualities in three dimensions and was used in @xcite to provide a non - trivial check for mirror symmetry in affine @xmath7-type ( @xmath8 ) quivers .",
    "in addition , it was shown that partition function of any quiver of this type admits a convenient decomposition in terms of contributions from ns5 and d5 branes .",
    "furthermore , these contributions are precisely exchanged under s - duality implemented at the level of the partition function , as one should expect .    in the present work",
    ", we will demonstrate how mirror symmetry in flavored affine @xmath9-type ( @xmath1 ) quiver gauge theories can be analyzed using partition functions on a round sphere . aside from providing extremely non - trivial checks on mirror symmetry for this class of quivers ,",
    "we show that the partition function may be decomposed again into appropriate  building blocks \" which are in one - to - one correspondence with the ingredients of the type iib set - up .",
    "in addition to contributions of ns5 and d5 branes familiar from the @xmath8 case , these include contributions from certain 1/2-bps boundary conditions involving orbifold / orientifold 5-planes which we shall discuss in detail in the paper .",
    "in this section , we summarize the basic field theory ingredients necessary for our story",
    ". we will also briefly discuss @xmath10 partition functions for @xmath0 gauge theories obtained using localization techniques .",
    "@xmath0 supersymmetry in @xmath11 has 8 real supercharges , which are doublets of @xmath12 and transform as @xmath13 under the r - symmetry group , @xmath14 . under the r - symmetry group @xmath15 , the relevant supermultiplets transform in the following way : + vector multiplet:@xmath16 + half - hyper multiplet:@xmath17    the half - hypers transform in pseudo - real representations of the gauge group . a @xmath0 hypermultiplet in three dimensions consists of two copies of half - hypers .    for the 3d vector multiplets , the bosons consist of an @xmath18-triplet of scalars and a gauge boson , which is an r - symmetry singlet . strictly speaking",
    ", the latter can be dualized to a circle - valued scalar only for an abelian gauge field . in that case",
    ", we obtain 4 scalars , transforming overall as @xmath19 . nevertheless , for a non - abelian gauge field , the gauge symmetry ( on either the coulomb or higgs branches ) is higgsed to @xmath20 an abelian subgroup .",
    "so it is useful to carry over this counting in describing the low - energy theory .",
    "since the matter content in these supermultiplets is not symmetric with respect to the exchange @xmath21 , there can be `` twisted '' multiplets where @xmath22 and @xmath18 are exchanged",
    ".      we will refer to a pair of mirror dual theories as the a - model and the b - model .",
    "mirror symmetry in three dimensions for @xmath0 theories has the following broad features :    * the duality exchanges the coulomb and the higgs branch of the a and the b - model : + @xmath23 note that it is a strictly ir duality  two theories with very different uv descriptions flowing to the same @xmath0 scft in the ir . * mirror symmetry exchanges @xmath22 and @xmath18",
    " thereby exchanging background vector and twisted vector multiplets .",
    "this naturally implies exchange of hypermultiplet masses and fi parameters under the duality . *",
    "the precise transformation between masses on one side of the duality and fi parameters on the other is captured by a linear map  often referred to as the  mirror map \" .",
    "there s also a map between the chiral operators on the coulomb branch of the a - model and the higgs branch of the b - model as expected . *",
    "mirror symmetry is a direct consequence of s - duality in the type iib setting . under s - duality , ns5 and d5 branes are exchanged while d3 branes are self - dual .",
    "similarly , an orbifold 5-plane is s - dual to a o@xmath24 planes ( i.e. o@xmath25 plane coincident with a d5 )  this plays a crucial role in mirror symmetry for affine @xmath9-type quivers .",
    "let us briefly summarize the rules for writing down the @xmath10 partition function of any given @xmath0 quiver gauge theory .",
    "* localization ensures that the partition function of the theory reduces to a matrix integral in terms of the real adjoint scalar @xmath26 of the 3d @xmath27 vector multiplet .",
    "any such partition function may be written as @xmath28}\\ , z_{\\text{1-loop}}[s]\\,,\\ ] ] note that one can make @xmath26 lie in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group using a constant gauge transformation . in the above formula",
    "@xmath29 is the product over all roots of the gauge group with @xmath26 being in the cartan of the gauge group - this is simply the vandermonte determinant .",
    "finally , one needs to divide by the order of the weyl group @xmath30 to account for the residual gauge symmetry .",
    "* consider first the contribution of vector multiplets in the @xmath5 theory to the classical and 1-loop part of the partition function .",
    "the classical contribution for every @xmath31 factor in the gauge group is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a fi parameter . to the 1-loop part",
    ", every @xmath0 vector multiplet contributes @xmath34 where the product is over all the roots of the lie algebra of g. * the contribution of each @xmath0 hypermultiplet is @xmath35 where the product extends over all the weights of the representation r of the gauge group g and @xmath36 is a real mass parameter . +",
    "a factor of vandermonte determinant appears in the measure as a result of gauge fixing @xmath26 .",
    "this exactly cancels with the denominator of the 1-loop contribution of the vector multiplet for each factor in the gauge group and can therefore be ignored in the matrix integral .",
    "+ given a quiver gauge theory , one can simply read off the independent mass deformations from the partition function ",
    "these correspond to the masses that can not be removed by constant shifts in the integration variable @xmath26 .",
    "let us state the basic idea underlying our computation . given a pair of conjectured dual theories",
    ", one may compute partition functions of such theories as functions of masses and fi parameters and check whether they agree up to some overall field - independent phase .",
    "therefore , the strategy is to start with the partition function of the a - model and implement some clever change of variables to show that it is equivalent to the partition function of the b - model .",
    "note that this change of variables essentially corresponds to implementing s - duality at the level of the partition function .",
    "comparison of partition functions of the conjectured dual theories as functions of masses and fi parameters naturally allows one to read off the  mirror map \"  the linear map between masses ( fi parameters ) on one side and fi parameters ( masses ) on the other .    for generic rank of the gauge group at every node in a given quiver , this manipulation is difficult and requires some very non - trivial identities involving hyperbolic functions , which we will discuss for the case of @xmath8 and @xmath1 quivers .",
    "affine @xmath7-type quivers arise in type iib string theory as world volume gauge theories on d3 branes wrapping a @xmath37 with ns5 and d5 branes inserted at different positions on this circle direction , see figure [ fig0al ] for an example .",

    "explicitly , @xmath46 is given as @xmath48 where in the final step we have used equation ( [ ftcosh ] ) and equation ( [ detid ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath47 reads @xmath49 note how in both cases we have introduced some auxiliary variables @xmath50 via fourier transformation . implementing s - duality at the partition function level",
    "now simply amounts to integrating over the variables @xmath51 and writing the partition function in terms of @xmath52 the auxiliary variables @xmath50 .",
    "one can easily check that this indeed exchanges the ns5 and d5 contributions in a given partition function as one would expect . written in terms of the auxiliary variables ,",
    "the partition function can be readily identified as the correct partition function for the dual gauge theory with variables @xmath50 identified as vevs of real adjoint scalars in appropriate vector multiplets for the dual theory .",
    "in addition to d5 , ns5 and d3 branes , type iib description for affine @xmath9-type quivers involve orbifold 5-planes .",
    "an orbifold 5-plane is often understood as the combination of a ns5 and a coincident on@xmath53 plane ( s - dual to a o5@xmath53 plane )  we refer the reader to @xcite for further details on this construction .",
