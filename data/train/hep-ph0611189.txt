    "after the recent experimental evidences about neutrino physics @xcite-@xcite we know very well almost all the parameters in the quark @xcite and lepton @xcite-@xcite sectors .",
    "we measured all the quark and charged lepton masses , and the value of the difference between the square of the neutrino masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we also know the value of the quark mixing angles and phases , and the two mixing angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the lepton sector .",
    "the challenger for the next future @xcite-@xcite will be to determine the sign of @xmath13 ( i.e. the hierarchy in the neutrino sector ) , the absolute scale of the neutrino masses , and the value of the 3rd lepton mixing angle @xmath14 ( in particular if is it zero or not ) .",
    "finally , if @xmath14 is not too small , there is a hope to measure the cp violating phases .",
    "despite the fact that we have all these experimental evidences , still a theory of flavor is missing .",
    "the main point is related to the fact that there is a hierarchy in the mixing angles and masses . in particular the quark mixing angles",
    "are in general much smaller then the corresponding lepton mixing angles .",
    "the small quark mixing angles can be explained with continuous flavor symmetries ( see for instance @xcite ) , while the structure of the lepton mixing matrix seems to be better accommodated in models with discrete symmetries ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "recently , the disparity that nature indicates between quark and lepton mixing angles has been viewed in terms of a quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) @xcite which can be expressed in the relations @xmath15 these relations are related to the parametrization used for the ckm and pmns mixing matrix . from a more general point of view , we can define a correlation matrix @xmath0 as the product of the pmns @xcite and ckm @xcite mixing matrices , @xmath16    a lot of efforts have been done to obtain the _ most favorite _ pattern for the matrix @xmath0  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the naive qlc relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qlcnaive ] ) seems to implies @xmath0 to be bimaximal , i.e. in the standard parametrization it contains two maximal mixing angle , and a third angle to be zero . a bimaximal @xmath17 implies a nice , in the sense that it is testable at the near future neutrino experiments , prediction on the @xmath18 mixing angle @xcite and the cp violating parameters for the lepton sector @xcite . at first order approximation",
    "however @xmath0 bimaximal seems not to be compatible with the experiments @xcite . from our previous work @xcite",
    "we learn that @xmath0 bimaximal , although it is not ruled out by the experiments , is excluded at 90% cl in non susy models , or in susy models with @xmath19 where the rge correction are negligible @xcite-@xcite .    despite the fact that the correlation matrix @xmath0 can not be bimaximal ,",
    "still there are very nice phenomenological consequences from a non trivial @xmath0 .",
    "all of these consequences seems to be related to the fact that experimental evidences tell us @xcite that @xmath8 is in good agreement with the experimental data , and is even the preferred value . from a theoretical point of view",
    "we like very much the fact that experimental data tell us that @xmath8 .",
    "first of all the theoretical ingredient of the quark - lepton complementarity that gives phenomenological predictions is @xmath8 .",

    "first we analyze the consequences of @xmath8 on the cp violating invariants for the lepton sector.then we show how a toy model , based on @xmath7 flavor permutation symmetry @xcite and gut gives @xmath8 .",
    "we use a monte carlo simulation with two - sided gaussian distributions around the mean values of the observables to extract the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 invariants .",
    "the input information on @xmath18 is taken from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite which uses quark lepton correlation ( @xmath8 ) , and neutrino and quark data .",
    "we obtain that the main ingredient to obtain a prediction on the cp violating invariants for the lepton sector is the constraint @xmath8 .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "we show that , if we do not take care about a required fine - tuning in obtaining the masses , it is possible to construct a toy model @xcite , based on @xmath7 flavor permutation symmetry and gut , that gives us @xmath8 . in grand",
    "unified theories ( gut ) , as long as quarks and leptons are inserted in the same representation of the gauge group , we need to include in the definition of @xmath0 non trivial phases between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing matrices . in our model",
    "@xmath0 is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a diagonal matrix @xmath23 and the three phases @xmath24 are free parameters ( in the sense that they are not determined by present experimental evidences ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 is related to the dirac and majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "for this reason its form is given by the symmetries of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  * [ sec : cp ] * we introduce our notation and the parameterization for ckm and pmns mixing matrices . with the aid of a monte carlo simulation",
