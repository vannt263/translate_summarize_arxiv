    "the exciting recent developments in the theory of quantum information and computation have already established an enduring legacy .",
    "the two most far - reaching results  that a quantum computer ( apparently ) can solve problems that will forever be beyond the reach of classical computers @xcite , and that quantum information can be protected from errors if properly encoded @xcite  have surely earned a prominent place at the foundations of computer science .",
    "the implications of these ideas for the future of physics are less clear , but we expect them to be profound . in particular , we anticipate that our deepening understanding of quantum information will lead to new strategies for pushing back the boundaries of quantum - limited measurements",
    ". quantum entanglement , quantum error correction , and quantum information processing can all be exploited to improve the information - gathering capability of physics experiments .    in a typical quantum - limited measurement , a classical signal",
    "is conveyed over a quantum channel @xcite .",
    "nature sends us a message , such as the value of a weak force , that can be regarded as a classical parameter appearing in the hamiltonian of the apparatus ( or more properly , if there is noise , its master equation ) .",
    "the apparatus undergoes a quantum operation @xmath0 , and we are to extract as much information as we can about the parameter(s ) @xmath1 by choosing an initial preparation of the apparatus , and a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) to read it out .",
    "quantum information theory should be able to provide a theory of the _ distinguishability of superoperators _ , a measure of how much information we can extract that distinguishes one superoperator from another , given some specified resources that are available for the purpose .",
    "this distinguishability measure would characterize the inviolable limits on measurement precision that can be achieved with fixed resources .",
    "many applications of quantum information theory involve the problem of distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum _",
    "states_. for example , a density operator @xmath2 is chosen at random from an ensemble @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is an _ a priori _ probability ) , and a measurement is performed to extract information about which @xmath5 was chosen .",
    "the problem of distinguishing _ superoperators _ is rather different , but the two problems are related .",
    "for example , let us at first ignore noise , and also suppose that the classical force we are trying to detect is static .",
    "then we are trying to identify a particular time - independent hamiltonian @xmath6 that has been drawn from an ensemble @xmath7 .",
    "we may choose a particular initial pure state @xmath8 , and then allow the state to evolve , as governed by the unknown hamiltonian , for a time @xmath9 ; our ensemble of possible hamiltonians generates an ensemble of pure states @xmath10 since our goal is to gain as much information as possible about the applied hamiltonian , we should choose the initial state @xmath8 so that the resulting final states are maximally distinguishable .",
    "there are many variations on the problem , distinguished in part by the resources we regard as most valuable .",
    "we might have the freedom to chose the elapsed time as we please , or we might impose constraints on @xmath9 .",
    "we might have the freedom to modify the hamiltonian by adding an additional `` driving '' term that is under our control .",
    "we might use an _ adaptive _ strategy , where we make repeated ( possibly weak ) measurements , and our choice of initial state or driving term in later measurements takes into account the information already collected in earlier measurements @xcite .    imposing an appropriate cost function on resources",
    "is an important aspect of the formulation of the problem , particularly in the case of the detection of a static ( dc ) signal .",
    "for example , we could in principle repeat the measurement procedure many times to continually improve the accuracy of our estimate . in this respect ,",
    "the problem of distinguishing superoperators does not have quite so fundamental a character as the problem of distinguishing states , as in the latter case the no - cloning principle @xcite prevents us from making repeated measurements on multiple copies of the unknown state .",
    "but for a time - dependent signal that stays `` on '' for a finite duration , there will be a well - defined notion of the optimal strategy for distinguishing one possible signal from another , once our apparatus and its coupling to the classical signal have been specified . still , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will mostly confine our attention here to the case of dc signals .",
    "we do nt know exactly what shape this nascent theory of the distinguishability of superoperators should take , but we hope that further research can promote the development of new strategies for performing high - precision measurements . on the one hand",
    "we envision a program of research that will be relevant to real laboratory situations . on the other hand ,",
    "we seek results that are to some degree robust and general ( not tied to some particular model of decoherence , or to a particular type of coupling between quantum probe and classical signal ) .",
    "naturally , there is some tension between these two central desiderata ; rather than focus on a specific experimental context , we lean here toward more abstract formulations of the problem .",
    "our discussion is far from definitive ; its goal is to invite a broader community to consider these issues",
    ". we will mostly be content to observe that some familiar concepts from the theory of quantum information and computation can be translated into tools for the measurement of classical forces .",
    "some examples include superdense coding , fast database search , and the quantum fourier transform .",
    "naturally , the connections between quantum information theory and precision measurement have been recognized previously by many authors .",
    "especially relevant is the work by wootters @xcite , by braunstein@xcite , and by braunstein and caves @xcite on state distinguishability and parameter estimation , and by braginsky and others @xcite on quantum nondemolition measurement .",
    "though what we have to add may be relatively modest , we hope that it may lead to further progress .",
    "recurring themes of quantum information theory are that entanglement can be a valuable resource , and that entangled measurements sometimes can collect more information than unentangled measurements",
    ". it should not be surprising , then , if the experimental physicist finds that the best strategies for detecting a weak classical signal involve the preparation of entangled states and the measurement of entangled observables .",
    "suppose , for example , that our apparatus is a single - qubit , whose time - independent hamiltonian ( aside from an irrelevant additive constant ) , can be expressed as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is an unknown three - vector , and @xmath13 are the pauli matrices .",
    "( we may imagine that a spin-@xmath14 particle with a magnetic moment is employed to measure a static magnetic field . ) by preparing an initial state of the qubit , allowing the qubit to evolve , and then performing a single measurement , we can extract at best one bit of information about the magnetic field ( as holevo s theorem @xcite ensures that the optimal povm in a two - dimensional hilbert space can acquire at most one bit of information about a quantum state ) .",
    "if we have two qubits , and measure them one at a time , we can collect at best two bits of information about the magnetic field . in principle",
    ", this could be enough to distinguish perfectly among four possible values of the field . in practice , for a generic choice of four hamiltonians labeled by vectors @xmath15 , the optimal information gain can not be achieved by measuring the qubits one at a time . rather a better strategy exploits quantum entanglement",
    ".    an improved strategy can be formulated by following the paradigm of superdense coding @xcite , whereby shared entanglement is exploited to enhance classical communication between two parties . to implement superdense coding , the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) use a shared bell state",
    "@xmath16 that they have prepared previously .",
    "alice applies one of the four unitary operators @xmath17 to her member of the entangled pair , and then sends it to bob . upon receipt , bob possesses one of the four mutually orthogonal bell states@xmath18 by performing an entangled bell measurement ( simultaneous measurements of the commuting collective observables @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , bob can perfectly distinguish the states .",
    "although only one qubit passes from alice to bob , two classical bits of information are transmitted and successfully decoded .",
    "in fact , this enhancement of the transmission rate is optimal  with shared entanglement , no more than two classical bits can be carried by each transmitted qubit @xcite .",
    "the lesson of superdense coding is that entanglement can allow us to better distinguish operations on quantum states , and we may apply this method to the problem of distinguishing hamiltonians .",
    "let us imagine that the magnitude of the magnetic field is known , but not its direction  then we can choose our unit of time so that @xmath21 .",
    "we may prepare a pair of qubits in the entangled state @xmath22 , and expose only one member of the pair to the magnetic field while the other remains well shielded . in time",
    "@xmath9 , the state evolves to @xmath23|\\phi^+\\rangle\\cr & = & \\cos t |\\phi^+\\rangle \\cr & & -i\\sin t \\left[a_1|\\psi^+\\rangle -ia_2|\\psi^-\\rangle + a_3|\\phi^+\\rangle\\right]~;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the inner product between the states arising from hamiltonians @xmath24 and @xmath25 becomes @xmath26 for these states to be orthogonal , we require @xmath27 since @xmath28 , the states are not orthogonal for any value of @xmath9 unless the two magnetic field directions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are separated by at least @xmath31 .",
    "now suppose that the magnetic field ( of known magnitude ) points in one of three directions that are related by three - fold rotational symmetry .",
    "these directions could form a planar trine with @xmath32 , or a `` lifted trine '' with angle @xmath33 between each pair of directions , where @xmath34 .",
    "for any such trine of field directions , we may evolve for a time @xmath9 such that @xmath35 and perform an ( entangled ) orthogonal measurement to determine the field . at the point of tetrahedral symmetry ,",
    "@xmath36 , we may add a fourth field direction such that the inner product for each pair of field directions is @xmath37 ; then all four directions can be perfectly distinguished by bell measurement .",
    "in this case of four field directions with tetrahedral symmetry , the two - bit measurement outcome achieves a two - bit information gain , if the four directions were equally likely _ a priori_. in contrast ,",
    "no adaptive strategy in which single qubits are measured one at a time can attain a two - bit information gain .",
    "this separation between the information gain attainable through entangled measurement and that attainable through adaptive nonentangled measurement , for the problem of distinguishing hamiltonians , recalls the analogous separation noted by peres and wootters @xcite for the problem of distinguishing nonorthogonal states .",
    "another instructive example is grover s method @xcite for searching an unsorted database , which ( as formulated by farhi and gutmann @xcite ) we may interpret as a method for improving the distinguishability of a set of hamiltonians by adding a controlled driving term .",
    "consider an @xmath38-dimensional hilbert space with orthonormal basis @xmath39 , and suppose that the hamiltonian for this system is known to be one of the @xmath38 operators @xmath40 we are to perform an experiment that will allow us to estimate the value of @xmath41 .",
    "we could , for example , prepare the initial state @xmath42 , and then perform an orthogonal measurement in the basis @xmath43 .",
    "then we will obtain the outcome @xmath44 if and only if one of @xmath45 is @xmath41 .",
    "searching for @xmath41 by this method , we would have to repeat the experiment for o(@xmath38 ) distinct initial states to have any reasonable chance of successfully inferring the value of @xmath41 .",
    "our task becomes easier if we are able to modify the hamiltonian by adding a term that we control to drive the system .",
    "we choose the driving term to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the state @xmath48 then the full hamiltonian is @xmath49 and we can readily verify that the vectors @xmath50 are ( unconventionally normalized ! ) eigenstates of @xmath51 with the eigenvalues @xmath52 we may prepare the initial state @xmath53 since the energy splitting is @xmath54 , after a time @xmath55 this state flops to the state @xmath56 thus , by performing an orthogonal measurement , we can learn the value of @xmath41 with certainty @xcite .",
    "the driving term we have chosen is the continuous time analog of the iteration employed by grover @xcite for rapid searching . and",
    "as the grover search algorithm can be seen to be optimal , in the sense that a marked state can be identified with high probability with the minimal number of oracle calls @xcite , so the driving term we have chosen is optimal in the sense that it enables us to identify the value of the classical parameter labeling the hamiltonian in the minimal time , at least asymptotically for @xmath38 large .",
    "( in a physics experiment , the `` oracle '' is nature , whose secrets we are eager to expose . ) for this grover - farhi - gutmann problem , we can make a definite statement about how to optimize expenditure of a valuable resource ( time ) in the identification of a system hamiltonian .",
    "we also note that adding a driving term can sometimes improve the efficacy of the superdense coding method described in  [ sec : superdense ] .",
    "for example , in the case of three magnetic fields of equal magnitude with threefold symmetry , but with an angle between fields of less than @xmath31 , applying a driving field along the line of symmetry can make the resultant field directions perfectly distinguishable .",
    "in fact , beckman @xcite has shown that for any three field vectors forming a triangle that is isosceles or nearly isosceles , a suitable driving field can always by found such that the field directions can be distinguished perfectly .",
    "let s consider the special case in which our apparatus is known to be governed by one of two possible hamiltonians @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "if the system is two dimensional , we are trying to distinguish two possible values @xmath59 of the magnetic field with a spin-@xmath14 probe .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the two fields have the same magnitude ( normalized to unity ) , but differing directions .",
    "assuming that we are unable to modify the hamiltonian by adding a driving term , the optimal strategy is to choose an initial polarization vector that bisects the two field directions @xmath60 .",
    "depending on the actual value of the field , the polarization will precess on one of two possible cones",
    ". if the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath61 , then the two possible polarizations will eventually be back - to - back ; an orthogonal measurement performed at that time will distinguish @xmath29 and @xmath30 perfectly .",
    "but if @xmath62 , the two polarizations are never back - to - back ; the best strategy is to wait until the angle between the polarizations is maximal , and to then perform the orthogonal measurement that best distinguishes them .",
    "we can not perfectly distinguish the two field directions by this method .    on the other hand",
    ", if we are able to apply a known driving magnetic field in addition to the unknown field that is to be determined , then two fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 can always be perfectly distinguished .",
    "if we apply the field @xmath65 , then the problem is one of distinguishing the trivial hamiltonian from @xmath66 we can choose an initial polarization orthogonal to @xmath67 , and wait just long enough for @xmath68 to rotate the polarization by @xmath69",
    ". then an orthogonal measurement perfectly distinguishes @xmath68 from the trivial hamiltonian .",
    "evidently , the same strategy can be applied to distinguish two hamiltonians @xmath57 and @xmath58 in a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "we drive the system with @xmath70 ; then to distinguish the trivial hamiltonian from @xmath71 , we chose the initial state @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the minimal and maximal eigenvalues of @xmath71 . after a time @xmath9 with @xmath74",
    "this state evolves to the orthogonal state @xmath75 , so that the trivial and nontrivial hamiltonians can be perfectly distinguished .    in the case of the two - dimensional version of the `` grover problem '' with @xmath76 )  the two hamiltonians can be distinguished in a time that is shorter by a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "so while the grover strategy is optimal for asymptotically large @xmath38 , it is not actually optimal for @xmath78 .",
    "let us now suppose that we are to distinguish between two time - independent hamiltonians @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and that a _ fixed duration _ @xmath9 has been allotted to perform the experiment .",
    "is the driving strategy described above ( in which @xmath70 is added to the hamiltonian ) always the best possible ?",
    "if we have the freedom to add a driving term of our choice , then we may assume without loss of generality that we are to distinguish the nontrivial hamiltonian @xmath51 from the trivial hamiltonian @xmath79 .",
    "as already noted , if the largest difference @xmath80 of eigenvalues of @xmath51 satisfies @xmath81 , then @xmath51 can be perfectly distinguished from @xmath79 ; let us therefore suppose that @xmath82 .",
    "if we add a _ time - independent _ driving term @xmath83 to the hamiltonian , and choose an initial state @xmath8 , then after a time t , we will need to distinguish the two states @xmath84 two pure states will be more distinguishable when their inner product is smaller .",
    "therefore , to best distinguish @xmath85 from @xmath83 , we should choose @xmath8 to minimize the inner product @xmath86 if we expand @xmath8 in terms of the eigenstates @xmath87 of @xmath88 with eigenvalues @xmath89 , @xmath90 this inner product becomes @xmath91 ) is the modulus of a convex sum of points on the unit circle .",
    "assuming the modulus is bounded from zero , it attains its minimum when @xmath8 is the equally weighted superposition of the extremal eigenstates of @xmath88  those whose eigenvalues are maximally separated on the unit circle . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the minimum is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the difference of the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of @xmath51 .",
    "we prove in appendix a that turning on a nonzero driving term @xmath83 can never cause the extremal eigenvalues to separate further , and therefore can never improve the distinguishability of the two states in eq .",
    "[ two_states ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 is the optimal driving term for distinguishing two hamiltonians . in other words ,",
    "if we wish to distinguish between two hamiltonians @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it is always best to turn on a driving term that precisely cancels one of the two .",
    "the above discussion encompasses the strategy of introducing an ancilla entangled with the probe ( which proved effective for the problem of distinguishing three or more alternatives ) .",
    "if we wish to distinguish two hamiltonians @xmath95 and @xmath96 that both act trivially on the ancilla , the optimal driving term exactly cancels one of them ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath97 ) , and so it too acts trivially on the ancilla .",
    "we derive no benefit from the ancilla when there are only two alternatives .",
    "similarly , if we are trying to distinguish only two time - independent signals in an allotted time , it seems likely there is no advantage to performing a sequence of weak measurements , and adapting the driving field in response to the incoming stream of measurement data .",
    "now suppose that there are @xmath38 possible hamiltonians @xmath98 .",
    "if there is no time limitation , we can distinguish them perfectly by implementing an adaptive procedure ; we make a series of measurements , modifying our driving term and initial state in response to the stream of measurement outcomes .",
    "the correct hamiltonian can be identified by pairwise elimination .",
    "first , assume that either @xmath57 or @xmath58 is the actual hamiltonian , and apply a driving term to perfectly distinguish them , say @xmath99 .",
    "after preparing the appropriate initial state and waiting the appropriate time , we make an orthogonal measurement with two outcomes  the result indicates that either @xmath57 or @xmath58 is the actual hamiltonian . nor @xmath58 is the actual hamiltonian . ]",
    "if the result is @xmath57 , there are two possibilities : either @xmath57 really is the hamiltonian , or the assumption that one of @xmath57 or @xmath58 is the hamiltonian was wrong . either way , @xmath58 has been eliminated .",
    "similarly , if @xmath58 is found , @xmath57 is eliminated .",
    "this procedure can then be repeated , eliminating one hamiltonian per measurement , thereby perfectly distinguishing among the @xmath38 hamiltonians in a total of @xmath100 measurements .",
    "this algorithm is quite inefficient , however .",
    "the measurement record is @xmath100 bits long , while the information gain is only @xmath101 bits .",
    "far more efficient adaptive procedures can be formulated in some cases .",
    "consider , for example , a single qubit in a magnetic field of known direction but unknown magnitude , so that @xmath102 and let us imagine that the value of the frequency @xmath103 is chosen equiprobably from among @xmath104 equally spaced possible values . without loss of generality",
    ", we may normalize the field so that the possible values range from 0 to @xmath105 ; then @xmath103 has a binary expansion @xmath106 that terminates after at most @xmath107 bits .",
    "the initial state @xmath108 evolves in time @xmath9 to @xmath109 ( up to an overall phase ) .",
    "if we wait for a time @xmath110 , the final state is @xmath111 basis indicates ( with certainty ) whether the bit @xmath112 is 0 or 1 .",
    "this outcome divides the set of possible hamiltonians in half , providing one bit of classical information .",
    "the set of remaining possible hamiltonians is still evenly spaced , but it may have a constant offset , depending on the value of @xmath112 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath112 is now known , so the offset can be eliminated .",
    "specifically , if we again prepare @xmath8 and now evolve for a time @xmath113 , we obtain the final state @xmath114 since @xmath112 is known , we can perform a phase transformation ( perhaps by applying an additional driving magnetic field ) to eliminate the phase @xmath115 ; measuring again in the @xmath116 basis determines the value of @xmath117 .    by continuing this procedure until all bits of @xmath103 are known ,",
    "we perfectly distinguish the @xmath118 possible hamiltonians in just @xmath107 measurements .",
    "the procedure is optimal in the sense that we gain one full bit of information about the hamiltonian in each measurement .    up until now we have imagined that the frequency @xmath103 takes one of @xmath118 equally spaced discrete values , but no such restriction is really necessary .",
    "indeed , what we have described is precisely the implementation of the @xmath107-qubit semiclassical quantum fourier transform as formulated by griffiths and niu @xcite ( whose relevance to phase estimation was emphasized by cleve _ et al . _",
    "thus the same procedure can be applied to obtain an estimate of the frequency to @xmath107-bit precision , even if the frequency is permitted to take an arbitrary real value in the interval @xmath119 .",
    "suppose that we attach to @xmath107 spins the labels @xmath120 , and expose the @xmath121th spin to the field for time @xmath122 ; we thus prepare the @xmath107-qubit state @xmath123 the adaptive algorithm is equivalent to the quantum fourier transform followed by measurement ; hence the @xmath107-bit measurement outcome @xmath124 occurs with probability @xmath125 \\right|^2.\\ ] ] if @xmath103 really does terminate in @xmath107 bits , then the outcome @xmath126 is guaranteed to be its correct binary expansion . but even if the binary expansion of @xmath103 does not terminate , the probability that our estimate @xmath124 is correct to @xmath107 bits of precision is still of order one .",
    "of course , to measure the frequency to a precision @xmath127 of order @xmath128 , we need to expose our probe spins to the unknown hamiltonian for a total time @xmath129 of order @xmath130 .",
    "the accuracy is limited by an energy - time uncertainty relation of the form @xmath131 .",
    "the semiclassical quantum fourier transform provides an elegant solution to the problem of performing an ideal `` phase measurement '' in the hilbert space of @xmath107 qubits .",
    "more broadly , any @xmath38-dimensional hilbert space with a preferred basis @xmath132 has a complementary basis of _ phase states _",
    "@xmath133 with @xmath134 for example , the hilbert space could be the truncated space of a harmonic oscillator like a mode of the electromagnetic field , with the occupation number restricted to be less than @xmath38 ; then the states @xmath135 are the `` phase squeezed '' states of the oscillator that have minimal phase uncertainty . since a povm in an @xmath38-dimensional hilbert space can acquire no more than @xmath101 bits of information about the preparation of the quantum state , the phase of an oscillator with occupation number less than @xmath38 can be measured to at best @xmath101 bits of accuracy .",
    "while it is easy to do an orthogonal measurement in the occupation number basis with an efficient photodetector , an orthogonal measurement in the @xmath135 basis is quite difficult to realize in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "but if the standard basis is the computational basis in the @xmath118-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath107 qubits , then an ideal phase measurement is simple to realize .",
    "since the phase eigenstates are actually not entangled states , we can carry out the measurement  _ adaptively _  one qubit at a time .    note that if we had an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer with an arbitrarily large amount of quantum memory , then adaptive measurement strategies might seem superfluous .",
    "we could achieve the same effect by introducing a large ancilla and a driving hamiltonian that acts on probe and ancilla , with all measurements postponed to the very end .",
    "but the semiclassical quantum fourier transform illustrates that adaptive techniques can reduce the complexity of the quantum information processing required to perform the measurement . in many cases ,",
    "an adaptive strategy may be realizable in practice , while the equivalent unitary strategy is completely infeasible .",
    "in all of our examples so far , we have ignored noise and decoherence . in practice , decoherence may compromise our ability to decipher the classical signal with high confidence . finding ways to improve",
    "measurement accuracy by effectively coping with decoherence is an important challenge faced by quantum information theory .",
    "if there is decoherence , our aim is to gain information about the value of a parameter in a master equation rather than a hamiltonian . to be concrete ,",
    "consider a single qubit governed by an unknown hamiltonian @xmath51 , and also subject to decoherence described by the `` depolarizing channel ; '' the density matrix @xmath136 of the qubit obeys the master equation @xmath137 - \\gamma\\left(\\rho-{1\\over 2 } i\\right)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the ( known ) damping rate .",
    "if we express @xmath136 in terms of the polarization vector @xmath139 , @xmath140 and the hamiltonian as @xmath141 then the master equation becomes @xmath142 the polarization precesses uniformly with circular frequency @xmath103 about the @xmath29-axis as it contracts with lifetime @xmath143 .",
    "suppose that we are to distinguish among two possible hamiltonians , which are assumed to be equiprobable .",
    "if we are able to add a driving term , we may assume that the two are the trivial hamiltonian and @xmath144 we choose the initial polarization vector @xmath145 .",
    "then if the hamiltonian is trivial , the polarization contracts as @xmath146 while under the nontrivial hamiltonian it contracts and rotates as @xmath147    when is the best time to measure the polarization ?",
    "we should wait until @xmath148 and @xmath149 point in distinguishable directions , but if we wait too long , the states will depolarize . the optimal measurement to distinguish the two is an orthogonal measurement of the polarization along the axis normal to the bisector of the vectors @xmath150 and @xmath151 . at time @xmath9 the probability that this measurement identifies the hamiltonian incorrectly is @xmath152 this error probability is minimized , and the information gain from the measurement is maximized , at a time @xmath9 such that @xmath153 if @xmath154 , this time is close to @xmath155 , the time we would measure to perfectly distinguish the hamiltonians in the absence of decoherence .",

    "( [ ent_symmetric ] ) , the important thing to notice is that with symmetric decoherence , entangled states decay no faster than product states ; therefore , we can enjoy the benefit of entanglement ( faster precession ) without paying the price ( faster decay ) .    to establish more firmly that entangled strategies outperform nonentangled strategies in the symmetric decoherence model",
    ", we should consider more closely what are the optimal final measurements for these two types of initial states . to give the problem a precise information - theoretic formulation , we return to the problem of distinguishing two cases , the trivial hamiltonian and @xmath171 , which are assumed to be equiprobable .",
    "for either the product initial state or the entangled initial state , we evolve for time @xmath9 , and then perform the best measurement that distinguishes between evolution governed by @xmath171 and trivial evolution . in both cases ,",
    "the measurement is permitted to be an entangled measurement ; that is , we optimize with respect to all povm s in the four - dimensional hilbert space .    in either case ( initial product state or initial entangled state ) , we can find the two - outcome povm that identifies the hamiltonian with minimal probability of error .",
    "when there is no decoherence , this povm ( when restricted to the two - dimensional subspace containing the two pure states to be distinguished ) is the familiar orthogonal measurement that best distinguishes two pure states of a qubit .",
    "in fact , for symmetric decoherence , this same measurement minimizes the error probability for any value of the damping rate @xmath138 .",
    "it is thus the two - outcome measurement with the maximal information gain ( the measurement outcome has maximal mutual information with the choice of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "although we do nt have a proof , we can make a reasonable guess that , for symmetric decoherence , this two - outcome measurement has the maximal information gain of any measurement , including povm s with more outcomes .",
    "if either initial state evolves for time @xmath9 , and then this optimal povm is performed , the error probability can be expressed as @xmath216 here @xmath217 is the angle between the states  that is , @xmath218 is the inner product of the evolving and static states , in the limit of no damping ( @xmath219 ) . for the entangled initial state",
    ", we have @xmath220 and for the product initial state , we have @xmath221 since @xmath222 for @xmath223 , the error probability achieved by the entangled initial state is smaller than that achieved by the product state for @xmath224 , which is sufficient to ensure that the error probability optimized with respect to @xmath9 is always smaller in the entangled case for any nonzero value of @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , if we optimize the information gain with respect to @xmath9 , the entangled strategy has the higher information gain for all @xmath225 .",
    "the improvement in information gain ( in bits ) achieved using an entangled initial state rather than a product initial state is plotted in fig .  1 as a function of @xmath226 .",
    "the maximum improvement of about .136 bits occurs for @xmath227 .",
    "we have already seen in  ii that , even in the absence of decoherence , an entangled strategy may outperform an unentangled strategy if we are trying to distinguish more than two alternatives .",
    "this advantage will persist when sufficiently weak decoherence is included , whether correlated or uncorrelated . in that event , since only one member of an entangled pair is exposed to the unknown hamiltonian , we may be able to shelter the other member of the pair from the ravages of the environment , slowing the decay of the state and strengthening the signal .",
    "we feel that quantum information theory , having already secured a central position at the foundations of computer science , will eventually erect bridges connecting with many subfields of physics .",
