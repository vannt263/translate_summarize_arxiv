    "present supernovae data strongly support cosmological models containing a perfect fluid with a negative pressure ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the oldest and most studied candidate for this fluid is the cosmological constant , which acts like a perfect fluid whose equation - of - state ( hereafter , eos ) is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fluid pressure and @xmath8 its density .",
    "but the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant is 60 - 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its natural value derived from quantum field theories .",
    "this discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem ( abbott 1988 , weinberg 1989 , carroll et  al .",
    "1992 , sahni & starobinsky 2000 ) and has led theorists to find alternative dark energy candidates with a present negative pressure .",
    "the simplest models are based on a generalisation of the cosmological constant , e.g. a barotropic fluid ( @xmath9 constant @xmath10 ; gonzlez - daz 2000 , di pietro & demaret 2001 ) or a homogeneous fluid for which @xmath11 is a linear function of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 constant ; goliath et  al .",
    "2001 , maor et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "these models are interesting because they are described by simple field equations .",
    "however , they suffer from a lack of physical justification .",
    "other models with a more general eos and stronger physical interpretation have been proposed ( peebles & ratra 1988 , ratra & peebles 1988 , wetterich 1988 , ferreira & joyce 1998 , steinhardt et  al .",
    "the most popular ones are based on a dynamical quintessential component represented by a minimally coupled scalar field evolving in a potential .",
    "mathematically , such a quintessence fluid can be described by an eos @xmath11 function of the redshift @xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) . among these quintessence models , we shall consider the one which assumes the existence of an ultra - light pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) field relaxing to its vacuum state ( frieman & waga 1998 , waga & frieman 2000 , ng & wiltshire 2001a ) . from the quantum viewpoint ,",
    "the pngb models are the simplest way to introduce a naturally ultra - light scalar field able to reproduce the cosmological observations ( frieman et  al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "moreover pngb models provide an interesting theoretical framework to any spontaneous symmetry breaking which could justify the neutrino mass found in the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein solution to the solar neutrino problem ( wolfenstein 1979 , mikheyev & smirnov 1985 ) .    in summary",
    ", many theoretical models describing a cosmological fluid with negative pressure have been proposed : some are designed to be mathematically simple while others rely on a more physical justification .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to put in evidence the strong degeneracies existing between the luminosity distance predicted by four quintessence models : a cosmological constant , a general barotropic fluid , a fluid with a linear equation - of - state and a more physical model based on a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson field .",
    "second , we shall determine the constraints on those models coming from the present observations of type ia supernovae ( hereafter , sneia ) and confirm the need for more data to discriminate between them .",
    "this may be fulfilled by the proposed snap satellite ( supernova / acceleration probe ; see snap url ) .",
    "the main objective of this instrument is to detect a very large number of supernovae up to a redshift of @xmath17 , in order to yield a more precise determination of the cosmological parameters and therefore to provide information on the nature of dark energy .",
    "the third objective of this paper is to analyse , by means of simulated data , how well future snap observations alone will be able to break the degeneracies that we put in evidence .",
    "several authors have already studied the feasibility of snap to determine the properties of the dark energy .",
    "depending on the method used for reconstructing the cosmological model , their conclusions are quite different : some authors are optimistic regarding the possible determination of the eos of the dark energy using sneia ( huterer & turner 1999 , nakaruma & chiba 1999 , saini et  al 2000 , chiba & nakaruma 2000 , weller & albrecht 2001 , 2002 ) while others are more cautious ( barger & marfatia 2001 , astier 2001 , maor et  al . 2001 , 2002 , gerke & efstathiou 2002 ) .",
    "most of these discrepancies can be traced back to the differences in initial assumptions , prior knowledge , ... used for the reconstruction of the cosmological model ( goliath 2001 ) .",
    "usually , optimistic conclusions result from strong assumptions , such as an accurate knowledge of @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we present the field equations describing the four cosmological models we have considered . in section 3 , we explicitly display the degeneracies between the luminosity distances predicted by these four models .",
    "the constraints brought by present sneia data on the parameters of each model are presented in section  4 . in section  5",
    ", we explore the ability of snap to break the degeneracies and so to discriminate among these models .",
    "finally , we summarize our work and give some conclusions in section  6 .",
    "the field equations of a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime filled with two non - interacting fluids , a pressureless fluid ( matter - @xmath1 ) and a spatially homogeneous scalar field @xmath18 in a potential @xmath19 ( quintessence - @xmath20 ) , can be written as @xmath21\\,h(z )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\,-\\,3\\,[1 + w(z)]\\,\\rho_x(z)\\,h(z ) , \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the time derivative , @xmath22 , the hubble parameter , @xmath23 , the curvature parameter ( @xmath24 ) and where @xmath25 , \\label{functiong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 .    when the scalar field acts like a fluid with a linear eos in @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 , equation ( [ functiong ] ) becomes @xmath27 and the friedmann equation given by ( [ hubble ] ) can be written as @xmath28 \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\displaystyle \\left .",
    "\\omega_x ( 1 + z ) ^2",
    "\\left [ e^{3 w_1 z}\\,(1 + z)^{1 + 3 ( w_0 - w_1 ) } - 1 \\right ] \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the relation between the density parameters has been used , i.e. @xmath24 .    the luminosity distance @xmath29 to an object at redshift @xmath12 is such that @xmath30 with @xmath31 for respectively a spatially closed , flat and open universe .",
    "note that @xmath32 is the luminosity distance whereas @xmath33 is a dimensionless quantity . for @xmath32 in units of mpc , the apparent magnitude can be expressed in terms of @xmath34 as follows @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the magnitude zero point in the @xmath37 band defined by @xmath38 + 25 \\label{barm}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 , the absolute magnitude of the sneia .",
    "hereafter , we focus on three types of models containing a scalar fluid with a linear eos ( cf . also models a , b and c in table  [ tablemodel ] ) :    1 .   : a scalar field still acting as a cosmological constant with no constraint on the geometry of the universe , i. e. a flrw model , 2 .   : a scalar fluid with a _ constant _ eos in a spatially flat universe , 3 .   : a scalar fluid with a _ linear _ eos in a spatially flat universe .",
    "these models are mathematically the simplest ones but they have no satisfactory physical interpretation .",
    "so we shall also consider a fourth quintessence model , based on physical arguments .",
    "this model is constructed with an ultra - light pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) field ( frieman & waga 1998 , waga & frieman 2000 , ng & wiltshire 2001a , 2001b ) . in quantum field theory , a nambu - goldstone boson field",
    "is generated when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "moreover , if this symmetry is explicitly broken , the nambu - goldstone boson acquires a mass and becomes a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson . a quintessence model based on a pngb field",
    "can be described by the field equations ( [ hubble])-([functiong ] ) with the following periodic potential ( frieman et  al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ) : @xmath40 + 1 \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the two mass scales , i.e. @xmath42 is the spontaneous- and @xmath41 is the explicit symmetry breaking scale .",
    "for such a model , the field equations ( [ hubble])-([functiong ] ) have no analytical solution .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the functions @xmath43 and @xmath22 can only be derived from a numerical integration .",
    "we take as initial conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the reduced planck mass ( see justification below ) . assuming again a spatially flat universe , we are left with a model depending on only two parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this model is referred to as `` '' ( cf . also table  [ tablemodel ] ) and its most important properties are summarized in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ figclassifd ] . because of the hubble damping , the pngb field is initially frozen near the top of its potential ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and therefore acts as a cosmological constant , so that @xmath49 .",
    "when the universe temperature becomes less than the pngb mass , i.e. @xmath50 , the field starts to slowly roll down the potential .",
    "the minimum of the potential is reached asymptotically , after a large number of coherent oscillations about it .",
    "this second phase corresponds to a scalar component which behaves on average as nonrelativistic matter .",
    "it means that model d looks initially like model a with @xmath51 and asymptotically like an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the larger the quintessence mass , the sooner the asymptotic state is reached .",
    "if the scalar field evolution starts before its energy density becomes dominant , the pngb field will never be relevant for the universe dynamics ( see figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "however , if the dynamical phase of the scalar field begins when the vacuum energy associated with the pngb field is already dominant , then the scalar energy density may dominate today the cosmic density of the universe and provide a non - negligible dark energy component ( see figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    ".characteristics of the four theoretical models considered in this paper . [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an important remark has to be made at this point : figures [ figdotb ] , [ figdotc ] and [ figdotd ] show that , whatever the true model is , a flrw model with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) can not be rejected on the basis of the snap observations .",
    "table  [ tableresult ] shows the probabilities to obtain misleading results when the true model is model a , b , c and d at the @xmath55 level ( @xmath56 ) and at the @xmath5 level ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "it also presents the probability to exclude the right model at the @xmath55 level ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "they give an idea of the degree of degeneracy between the models , with respect to the computation of the luminosity distances .",
    "for example , it is difficult to identify a true model b among wrong models : the probabilities to confuse model b with model a , c and d are respectively @xmath4 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , at @xmath5 level .",
    "model c can not be distinguished from models a , b and d in @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the cases respectively ( @xmath5 level ) .",
    "note that the use of model c as fiducial model assumed an exactly known @xmath1 .",
    "an uncertainty on @xmath1 will increase the percentages given above .",
    "finally , if the fiducial model is a or d , we can expect to rule out the proposed wrong models with an a priori probability higher than @xmath64 at the 3 @xmath65 level .",
    "however this does not preclude a priori a degeneracy between those models any other possible model .",
    "samples simulated with model d can lead @xmath66 values less than @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , which means that the correct model can be excluded at the @xmath55 level and confirms the sensitivity of model d to the statistical noise . table [ tableresult ] also shows that , whatever the true model is ( b , c or d ) , the probability to reject model a at @xmath55 is low .",
    "the probabilities presented in table  [ tableresult ] clearly depend on the regions of the different parameter spaces used for the data simulations . however , in order to obtain meaningful results , we chose the parameter ranges surrounding the physical part of the contours presented in figure [ figperlmutter ] .",
    "making use of four quintessence models , of which three are mathematically simple and one is coming directly from particle physics , we have first shown that the various cosmological models may predict apparent magnitudes for objects at given redshifts which differ from each other by less than 0.04 mag till @xmath69 .",
    "these magnitude differences are thus small compared to the intrinsic spread of the sneia maximum luminosity ( 0.15 mag ) .",
    "this indicates that an unambiguous discrimination between the cosmological models will be difficult to reach , with cosmological tests only based on luminosity distances .",
    "second , we have fitted these models to the present supernovae data and found equally good fits with the four models . finally , we have explored the discriminatory power of future sneia data to constrain the dark energy properties .",
    "we have simulated a large number of snap data with each particular model and have re - analysed them with the four cosmological models .",
    "we have then compared the positions and the values of the @xmath70 obtained using wrong models with those obtained with the fiducial model . this led us to confirm the more skeptical conclusions already made in some previous works on the subject ( barger and marfatia 2001 , astier 2001 , maor et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) : some degeneracies between the curvature , the matter density and the equation - of - state of dark energy will be difficult to break at the @xmath55 level and even at the @xmath5 and @xmath71 level .",
    "we also found that different estimates of a basic parameter like @xmath1 can be obtained , depending on the model used for the data processing .",
    "moreover , whatever the true model is , the presently admitted flrw model with @xmath52 and @xmath53 will not be rejected on the basis of the future snap observations alone . in order to compare results expected from snap with the ones which could be obtained by other supernovae surveys",
    ", we have also generated data samples from models c and d for another redshift distribution : 2050 sneia between @xmath72 and @xmath73 and 50 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 = 0.15 mag ) .",
    "this distribution reflects future observations to be made with the 4 m liquid mirror telescope ( see ilmt url ) and with the next generation space telescope ( see ngst url ) .",
    "no significant difference has been found with the results presented here .",
    "many recent papers discussed the strong constraints that could be expected from future sneia data on cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the most important question is : how can we be sure that we consider the right model  ?",
    "indeed how useful are strong constraints on cosmological parameters if they do not describe the model chosen by mother nature  ?",
    "the degeneracy problem presented in this paper is expected to affect every cosmological test using luminosity distance",
    ". therefore it will be very difficult for snap alone to obtain any strong and safe constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , we expect that the combination of the cmb data with the future snap ones could help to break some of the luminosity distance degeneracies .",
    "this fact is already known in the framework of a single cosmological model ( see e.g. huterer & turner 2001 , frieman et al .",
    "2002 , bean & melchiorri 2002 ) .",
    "the authors are grateful to e. linder for `` stimulating '' comments on the very first version of this paper .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank e. gosset and a. smette for constructive discussions and b. gerke , a. melchiorri and d. wiltshire for drawing our attention to their recent works on a similar subject .",
    "this work was supported in part by belgian interuniversity attraction pole p5/36 , by a grant from the `` fonds national de la recherche scientifique '' ( f.r.i.a . ) , and by prodex ( office of science , technology , and culture , brussels ) .",
