    "that is , we start from the top of a fibonacci tiling and branch left if we see a tile of height 1 and branch right if we see a tiling of height 2 .",
    "for example , the fibonacci tree for @xmath106 is pictured in figure [ fig : ftree ] .",
    "then for any tiling @xmath107 , we define the rank of @xmath44 for @xmath0 , @xmath108 , to be the number of paths to the left of the path for @xmath44 in the fibonacci tree for @xmath0 .",

    "it is , in fact , quite easy to see compute the functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 in this situation .",
    "that is , suppose that we represent the tiling @xmath44 as a sequence @xmath113 where reading the tiles starting at the bottom , @xmath114 if there is a tiling @xmath115 of height @xmath116 that ends at level @xmath117 in @xmath44 , @xmath118 if there is @xmath115 of height @xmath119 that ends at level @xmath117 in @xmath44 , and @xmath120 if there is no tile @xmath115 that ends at level @xmath117 in @xmath44 .",

    "it is clearly true for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "now suppose @xmath129 .",

    "then the tree that starting at level @xmath134 which represents taking the path to the right starting at level @xmath38 is just the fibonacci tree for @xmath135 and the number of paths in this tree which lie to the left of the path for @xmath44 is just that the number of paths to the left of the tiling @xmath136 such that @xmath137 in the fibonacci tree for @xmath135 .",

    "indeed , zeckendorf s theorem says that the greedy algorithm give us the proper representation .",
    "that is , given @xmath38 , find @xmath36 such that @xmath147 , then the representation for @xmath38 is gotten by taking the representation for @xmath148 and adding @xmath149 .",
    "for example , suppose that we want to find @xmath44 such that @xmath150",

    "in this section , we shall give a rook theory model which will allow us to give combinatorial interpretations for the @xmath82s and the @xmath78s .",
    "this rook theory model is based on the one which bach , paudyal , and remmel used in @xcite to give combinatorial interpretations to the @xmath58s and the @xmath69s .",
    "thus , we shall briefly review the rook theory model in @xcite .",
    "a ferrers board @xmath158 is a board whose column heights are @xmath159 , reading from left to right , such that @xmath160 .",
    "we shall let @xmath161 denote the ferrers board @xmath162 .",
    "for example , the ferrers board @xmath163 is pictured on the left of figure [ fig : ferrers ] and the ferrers board @xmath164 is pictured on the right of figure [ fig : ferrers ]    classically , there are two type of rook placements that we consider on a ferrers board @xmath165 .",
    "first we let @xmath166 be the set of all placements of @xmath36 rooks in @xmath165 such that no two rooks lie in the same row or column .",
    "we shall call an element of @xmath166 a placement of @xmath36 non - attacking rooks in @xmath165 or just a rook placement for short .",
    "we let @xmath167 be the set of all placements of @xmath36 rooks in @xmath165 such that no two rooks lie in the same column .",
    "we shall call an element of @xmath167 a file placement of @xmath36 rooks in @xmath165 .",
    "thus file placements differ from rook placements in that file placements allow two rooks to be in the same row . for example , we exhibit a placement of 3 non - attacking rooks in @xmath168 on the left in figure [ fig : placements ] and a file placement of 3 rooks on the right in figure [ fig : placements ] .    given a ferrers board @xmath169 , we define the @xmath36-th rook number of @xmath165 to be @xmath170 and the @xmath36-th file number of @xmath165 to be @xmath171 .",
    "then the rook theory interpretation of the classical stirling numbers is @xmath172    the idea of @xcite is to modify the sets @xmath166 and @xmath167 to replace rooks with fibonacci tilings .",
    "the analogue of file placements is very straightforward .",
    "that is , if @xmath158 , then we let @xmath173 denote the set of all configurations such that there are @xmath36 columns @xmath174 of @xmath165 where @xmath175 such that in each column @xmath176 , we have placed one of the tilings @xmath177 for the fibonacci number @xmath178",
