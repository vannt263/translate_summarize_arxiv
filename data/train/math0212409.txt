    "bearing in mind the singular variant of green s lemma implicit in 2.5 , which for example makes it applicable to stable families of curves , it would appear that the unique known case not covered by the methods of brody and green was a theorem of bloch himself , [ bl ] , i.e. @xmath624 planes in general position@xmath63 , and its subsequent extension by cartan to @xmath64 , [ c ] .",
    "however , even here , a moment s inspection shows that 2.5 holds , so one knows a priori that there can be no bubbling , and whence complete hyperbolicity in the sense of 3.1 trivially implies so - called normal convergence modulo the diagonal hyperplanes , and the correct structure is obscured .",
