    "opto- and electro - mechanical systems in which a nanomechanical resonator is coupled to an optical or microwave cavity mode have been recently operated in the quantum regime by exploiting the so called linearised regime where the effective optomechanical interaction is enhanced by strongly driving the selected cavity mode  @xcite . in this regime",
    "the system dynamics is linear and one is typically restricted to the manipulation and detection of gaussian states of optical and mechanical modes  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a strong interest in realizing optomechanical devices able to reach the strong single - photon optomechanical coupling regime  @xcite , where the nonlinear nature of the radiation pressure coupling would allow the demonstration of novel phenomena .",
    "in fact , if the single - photon optomechanical coupling is large enough , the nonlinear dispersive nature of the radiation - pressure interaction would allow the observation of photon blockade  @xcite , the generation of mechanical non - gaussian steady states  @xcite , nontrivial photon statistics in the presence of coherent driving  @xcite , quantum non - demolition measurement  @xcite , single - photon detection  @xcite , and quantum gates  @xcite at the single photon / phonon level .",
    "a further possibility is to use single photon optomechanical interferometry in this strong coupling regime for generating and detecting quantum superpositions at the macroscopic scale , eventually exploiting post - selection  @xcite .",
    "the standard path for reaching the strong single - photon optomechanical coupling regime is to consider co - localised optical and vibrational modes  @xcite , with a large spatial overlap confined in very small volumes , corresponding to mechanical modes with extremely small effective mass .",
    "an alternative solution , capable of providing systems with a large ratio between the single - photon optomechanical coupling rate @xmath1 and the cavity decay rate @xmath2 , is to exploit quantum interference in multi - element optomechanical setups  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath0 can be increased by orders of magnitude even in more massive systems . here",
    "we study in detail such a constructive interference enhancement in the simplest case of two parallel membranes within an optical cavity .",
    "we derive and solve the equation for the optical cavity mode resonance frequencies .",
    "the behaviour of these frequencies as a function of the center - of - mass ( com ) and relative distance of the two membranes provides a complete description of the optomechanical properties of the system and will allow us to establish which are the parameters to tune in order to reach large @xmath0 values .",
    "in such a two - membrane optomechanical system , the dependence of the cavity mode frequencies on the positions of the membranes is central to the description of the system , since it determines the optomechanical couplings  @xcite .",
    "however , we know that the mode equation is transcendental and can not be solved analytically .",
    "the cavity resonance in such a system has been first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which approximate analytical solutions of the mode equation are obtained in a perturbative manner .",
    "however , the solutions there are provided for only a few particular membrane positions , i.e. , the equilibrium positions of the membranes are not left as free parameters in the optical frequencies . in this article , we instead provide approximate analytical solutions that work in more _ general _ situations , i.e. , the optical mode frequency is a function of the com @xmath3 and the relative position @xmath4 of the two membranes . with these analytical approximations",
    ", one can straightforwardly derive the optomechanical coupling for the com and the relative motion of the two membranes .",
    "we find that the optomechanical coupling of the latter can be significantly increased in the case of high - reflectivity membranes , @xmath5 , when the two membranes are positioned such that the inner cavity they form is resonant .",
    "such a coupling saturates to the value corresponding to the inner cavity , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the cavity frequency ) for very small @xmath4 , as already shown in refs .",
    "these latter references focused on the scaling of the optomechanical coupling with the membranes at certain predefined fixed positions , without analyzing the generic dependence of the optical mode frequency versus the membrane positions along the cavity axis .",
    "moreover they did not analyze in detail the effect of the membrane positions onto the cavity finesse . on the contrary , here we derive also an analytical expression for the cavity finesse versus the relative position @xmath4 of the two membranes .",
    "in particular , we have verified that the cavity finesse , and therefore the cavity decay rate , is not appreciably altered by the two membranes under the strong coupling condition ; as a consequence @xmath0 may be significantly increased , so that the two - membrane system is a promising candidate for the realisation of strong - coupling optomechanics .",

    "<S> we study the cavity mode frequencies of a fabry  prot cavity containing two vibrating dielectric membranes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equations for the mode resonances and provide approximate analytical solutions for them as a function of the membrane positions , which act as an excellent approximation when the relative and center - of - mass position of the two membranes are much smaller than the cavity length . with these analytical solutions , one finds that extremely large optomechanical coupling of the membrane relative motion can be achieved in the limit of highly reflective membranes when the two membranes are placed very close to a resonance of the inner cavity formed by them . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the cavity finesse of the system and verify that , under the conditions of large coupling , it is not appreciably affected by the presence of the two membranes . </S>",
    "<S> the achievable large values of the ratio between the optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate , @xmath0 , make this two - membrane system the simplest promising platform for implementing cavity optomechanics in the strong coupling regime . </S>"
