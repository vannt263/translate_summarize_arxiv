    "a deep understanding of the high redshift universe is vital in order to complete our knowledge of galaxy formation , and hence uncover the history of the universe as a whole . with the continued development of instrumentation and of new analysis techniques our knowledge of the high redshift universe is increasing rapidly .",
    "thanks to new deep imaging and multiobject spectroscopy we now have the power to routinely look back at the universe over cosmic time to witness step by step evolution . the result of",
    "this has been a wealth of observations of large samples of galaxies over a large redshift range in various surveys , such as within goods ( @xcite ) , cosmos and z - cosmos ( @xcite and @xcite ) and aegis ( @xcite ) .",
    "these large samples give us the power to achieve statistically meaningful results concerning the evolution of galaxy properties .    as a result",
    "a detailed picture is beginning to form regarding when galaxy stellar mass is built up over cosmic time .",
    "various studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have focused on the change of stellar mass density with time , and have seen generally consistent results .",
    "these studies find that the integrated stellar mass density decreases at higher redshift , as expected since the ongoing process of star formation increases the amount of stellar mass in the universe over time .",
    "these studies also show that roughly 50% of the mass density of the universe is in place by @xmath14 .",
    "this implies prior to this redshift the comoving stellar mass density has a more rapid evolution .",
    "this ties in with studies that show that the star formation rate peak is at @xmath15 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while studies of the star formation history has been the traditional way to examine and probe galaxy evolution , a great deal of research has been carried out investigating the evolution of galaxies using the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "early examples of the measurement of the local galaxy mass function at @xmath16 have been carried out by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , using surveys such as 2mass , 2df , and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these and other investigations construct the stellar mass function , and integrated stellar mass density within the local universe , and hence provide a vital benchmark for comparison with higher redshifts .",
    "it is important to understand the stellar mass function of the local universe in itself as this traces the integrated star formation and mass assembly history over the entire universe .",
    "however , by extending similar studies to higher redshift we can investigate not only galaxy growth as a function of stellar mass , but also the growth of integrated galaxy stellar mass with time .",
    "that is , we can trace the evolution of stellar mass for galaxies of different stellar masses , i.e. , very massive galaxies vs. lower mass galaxies , over time .",
    "this gives us insights into the growth of galaxies of different stellar masses due to star formation , mergers and other assembly processes .",
    "many studies have investigated the stellar mass function up to @xmath17 using relatively large area surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been further extended to even higher redshifts using deeper surveys , generally within a much smaller area ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies of the stellar mass function at high redshifts allows us to form a picture of the high mass end of the stellar mass function as a function of redshift .",
    "it is widely agreed that the dominance of star formation within massive galaxies ends much earlier than within low stellar mass galaxies by @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is one form of galaxy downsizing , whereby the higher stellar mass galaxies have their star formation truncated , or gas depleted , earlier than lower mass galaxies .",
    "this formation scenario was first observed by @xcite and subsequently observed in various studies including e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "downsizing is now accepted as part of the formation scenario of galaxies , but is not yet fully understood .",
    "what is also not fully understood is whether the related , but different process of mass downsizing , is occurring in tandem , such that the high mass galaxies form their stellar mass earlier than lower mass galaxies , and when this stellar mass differentiated galaxy formation process first reveals itself .    despite the considerable work done investigating the high mass end of the stellar mass function ,",
    "there are still many issues that are not yet fully understood .",
    "firstly , the generally shape of the high redshift stellar mass function is not well described .",
    "nearby stellar mass functions are well fit by a form of the schechter function , and there are various investigations regarding how the parameters of this fit change with redshift .",
    "secondly , difficulties with obtaining deep data at high redshifts mean that the low mass end of the stellar mass function has not been explored as fully , or to as high a redshift .",
    "more recent work has started to uncover a possible steepening with redshift of the low stellar mass end , and a  dip \" in the intermediate stellar mass range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that this is a result of evolution of different galaxy populations driven by their mass ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the exact nature and reasons behind such features of the stellar mass function are not well understood , and this can only be improved upon with deeper , more robust data .",
    "this will then lead to a better understanding of how the populations of galaxies , as defined by stellar mass , change and evolve over time .    in this paper",
    "we use data from the goods nicmos survey ( gns ) to investigate how the stellar mass function evolves from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . by examining the stellar mass functions of galaxies ranging in stellar mass from @xmath3 to as low as @xmath20 we investigate",
    "when , and which galaxies are forming at various epochs in the universe .",
    "the depth of the gns data is such that we are able to probe over a factor of 10@xmath21 the stellar mass evolution up to @xmath22 and importantly trace how galaxies of different masses are evolving with time .",
    "we find throughout this paper a differential in the stellar mass function and how it evolves , revealing a strong stellar mass dependence in the galaxy formation process .",
    "we describe this and give some general explanations for how this differential evolution can occur due to different physical processes .",
    "the paper is set out as follows : section [ sec : gns ] discusses the goods - nicmos survey , the galaxy sample and how the data used in this paper was obtained .",
    "section [ sec : totalmf ] examines the galaxy stellar mass functions of all the galaxies in various redshift bins . in sections [ sec : mfforbr ] and [ sec :",
    "mfforsf ] we split the galaxies into blue and red and star forming and non - star forming respectively .",
    "section [ sec : massden ] describes the calculation of the stellar mass densities for the total sample and for the red and blue populations .",
    "sections [ sec : diss ] and [ sec : summ ] contain the discussion and summary of our findings respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 . ab magnitudes and a salpeter imf are used throughout .",
    "the galaxy sample used in this work is taken from and imaged as part of the goods - nicmos survey ( gns ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gns consists of 60 pointings of the hst nicmos-3 camera utilising a total of 180 orbits .",
    "the field of view of nicmos-3 is 51.2 arcsec x 51.2 arcsec with a pixel scale of 0.203 arcsec / pixel .",
    "each nic3 tile was observed in six exposures , which combined give a pixel scale of 0.1 arcsec / pixel with a point spread function ( psf ) of @xmath27 0.3 arcsec full width half maximum ( fwhm ) . within the gns we find 8298 galaxies in the @xmath0 band ( f160w ) , and the 60 pointings",
    "are designed to contain as many massive galaxies ( @xmath28 ) as possible .",
    "these massive galaxies are in the redshift range @xmath29 and at a depth of three orbits .",
    "the galaxies are redshift selected based on their optical to infrared colour described in @xcite .",
    "details on the data reduction pipeline are described in @xcite .",
    "the detections and photometry were done using sextractor ( @xcite ) . at 5@xmath30",
    "the limiting magnitude is @xmath0=26.8 , a marked improvement on the goods ground based data at @xmath3124.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "further description of the gns , the pointings and the target selection is given in @xcite .",
    "other analysis of the gns data set can be found in @xcite , @xcite , bauer et al .",
    "( 2010 , submitted ) , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thanks to the large amount of optical data covering the goods fields , the @xmath0 band sources are matched to a catalogue of @xmath32 and @xmath33 band data .",
    "this photometry is avaliable down to a limiting magnitude of b@xmath2728.2 , and the matching is done within a radius of 2@xmath34 .",
    "however the mean separation between the optical and @xmath0 band coordinates is markedly better than this with @xmath35 @xmath270.28@xmath360.4 \" , which is roughly the resolution of nicmos . with this multiband data template spectra",
    "we fit to the @xmath37 photometric data points .",
    "this was handled in two different ways to overcome the degeneracy in colour - redshift space .",
    "the first uses hyperz ( @xcite ) which is the standard @xmath38 minimisation technique .",
    "hyperz uses model spectra which were constructed using the evolutionary codes of @xcite . here",
    "we use five evolutionary types , e , sa , sc , i m and a single burst scenario .",
    "the reddening law is that of @xcite .",
    "the most likely redshift is then computed in the age , metalicity , reddening parameter space , giving the best fit redshift , corresponding probability and several other best fit parameteres .",
    "the second method used to obtain our photometric redshifts is the bayesian approach using bpz .",
    "this is a similar fitting method to hyperz but employs empirical seds rather than model ones . as well as this",
    ", bpz uses the maximum likelihood in the same parameter space as hyperz , but with the addition of empirical information regarding the likelihood of a certain combination of parameters .",
    "this is known as prior information , or priors . here",
    ", we used the distribution of magnitudes of different galaxy types as a function of redshift as the priors ( from hdf - n , @xcite ) . therefore in this case , not only does the code find the best fit redshift solution and spectral type , it also consideres how likely it is to find a galaxy of that type and magnitude at that redshift .",
    "a total of 906 spectroscopic redshifts are avaliable for comparison with our photometric redshifts from the goods - n ( @xcite ) and the goods - s ( @xcite ) fields .",
    "the reliability of photometric redshifts is defined as @xmath39 , the median error ( @xmath40 ) and the r.m.s ( @xmath30 ) are as follows . for hyperz",
    ", the goods - n gives @xmath40 = 0.027 with @xmath30=0.04 , and for the goods - s @xmath40 = 0.043 with @xmath30=0.04 .",
    "for bpz , the goods - n @xmath40 = 0.07 with @xmath30=0.05 and for the goods - s @xmath40 = 0.07 with @xmath30=0.06 . in both codes the extreme catastrophic outliers , as defined by @xmath41 , are around @xmath276% .",
    "the dependence of the redshift on the @xmath0 magnitude shows the reliability of redshift within our selection methods and in this case hyperz shows a slightly better performance ( @xcite ) .",
    "our work shows good agreement with photometric redshifts from past surveys ( e.g. fireworks ) , although our sample is bright , and it is unclear if this would be the case for fainter galaxies .",
    "we further investigate the performance of hyperz at different redshifts , at low redshift ( @xmath6 ) and in the redshift range of @xmath42 , which is the redshift range of the galaxy sample we use in this study .",
    "for the high redshift sample we obtain an average offset @xmath43 and a rms of @xmath44 , with a fraction of catastrophic outliers of @xmath45 . here",
    "catastrophic outliers are defined as galaxies with @xmath46 , which corresponds to @xmath27 3 times the rms scatter .",
    "galaxies below @xmath47 show a slightly lower , but still comparable scatter of @xmath48 , however the outlier fraction decreases dramatically to only @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , we simulate the effects of the photometric redshift errors on our results throughout this paper .",
    "the stellar masses we use are obtained from the same @xmath37 catalogue as used to measure the photometric redshifts described previously , using a standard multicolour stellar population fitting technique ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . the photometry is fit to different star formation histories , based on the redshift of the galaxy , with spectroscopic redshifts used when avaliable .",
    "this produces a distribution of likely stellar masses , rest frame optical colours and various other parameters based on a baysian approach .",
    "the model seds are constructed from @xcite models , and the star formation history is characterised by an exponentially declining model with various ages , metalicities and dust extinctions .",
    "the star formation rate is parameterised by an e - folding time and an age such that , @xmath50 the parameters in equation [ eq : sfrexp ] are varied randomly within the ranges ; @xmath51=0.01 to 10 gyrs , t=0 to 10 gyrs , metallicity= 0.0001 to 0.05 and the dust content is parameterised by @xmath52=0.0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 .",
    "these model seds are then fit to the observed photometric data points using a bayesian approach resulting in a likelihood distribution of stellar mass , age and absolute magnitude for each possible star formation history .",
    "the stellar mass is determined based on this distribution , where the most likely stellar mass produces a peak in the distribution , and the uncertainty is the width .",
    "the final errors produced are a result of the models used and are found to be in the range 0.2 to 0.3 dex . while several of the other parameters produced by this method are not reliable , the stellar masses and colours are robust ( see @xcite and @xcite for further explanation . ) .",
    "it is also possible that the stellar masses are an over estimate due to the poor treatment of the tp - agb phase in a star s life .",
    "the effects of this are much less important at the rest frame wavelengths used in this study , especially in the infrared h - band . by using the newer models of bruzual and charlot ( 2010 ) which include a more proper treatment of tp - agb stars",
    "we find it only lowers the masses in our massive galaxy sample by @xmath530.07 dex .",
    "this effect is much smaller than the stellar mass error and the effects of cosmic variance and it is therefore considered negligible in this work .      to obtain star formation rates ( sfrs ) for our gns galaxies we use the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity , which we derive from observed rest frame optical light following the procedure described in bauer et al .",
    "( 2010 , submitted ) .",
    "the uv luminosity is closely related to the level of ongoing star formation because it is mainly produced by short - lived o and b stars .",
    "an advantage of using uv light to estimate star formation is that it remains largely unaffected by the age - metallicity degeneracy ( @xcite ) , but as is well known , star formation rate estimates derived from uv light are strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "the 2800@xmath54 rest - frame luminosity is calculated from the observed optical hubble / acs @xmath33-band flux density , which corresponds to rest - frame wavelengths of 3400 - 2125@xmath54 for @xmath55 galaxies .",
    "to derive sfr@xmath56 we apply a simple k - correction derived from the redshift of each object as log(@xmath57 ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) and use the @xcite conversion from 2800@xmath54 luminosity to star formation rate assuming a salpeter imf :    @xmath58    before dust extinction is taken into account ( section [ dust ] ) , we find at @xmath47 a limiting sfr@xmath59yr@xmath26 and at @xmath60 , we find a limit of sfr@xmath61yr@xmath26 .",
    "the errors take into account photometric errors and the error in the conversion from a luminosity to a star formation rate ( see also bauer et al .",
    "( 2011 , in prep . ) .      to obtain reliable star formation rates from the rest - frame ultraviolet , we need to account for the amount of light obscured by dust , which is a non - trivial problem . @xcite demonstrated a correlation between dust attenuation and rest - frame uv slope , @xmath62 , for a sample of nearby starburst galaxies ( where @xmath63 ) .",
    "updated studies of local galaxies using the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) near - ultraviolet band and",
    "@xmath64 galaxies show that the uv slope from the local starburst relation can be used to recover the dust attenuation of a vast majority of moderately luminous galaxies at @xmath64 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "to determine the uv slope , we use the sed - fitting procedure .",
    "we fit a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to multi - wavelength observations from optical to mid - infrared , following the procedure described in @xcite and bauer et al .",
    "briefly , the uv through mir seds obtained for all sources in the goods fields were fitted with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "then , the best - fitting templates were used to get synthetic estimations of the uv emission at 1600@xmath54 and 2800@xmath54 . from the synthetic ,",
    "model - derived uv luminosities at 1600@xmath54 and 2800@xmath54 , we calculate the spectral slope , @xmath62 .",
    "we use the @xcite law to derive a@xmath65 from the uv spectral slope , which we then apply to the uv - derived star formation rates . using this method",
    "we find an average extinction value of a@xmath66  1.2 mag .",
    "we find that all galaxies in the gns exhibit a range in sfr@xmath67 between 0.2 @xmath68yr@xmath26 and @xmath272000 @xmath68yr@xmath26 .",
    "a full description of our star formation measure is provided in bauer et al .",
    ".the total galaxy stellar mass functions seen in figure [ totmf ] [ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ]     we integrate over the schechter function to get the integrated stellar mass density between @xmath69 .",
    "this is the total amount of stellar mass contained within galaxies , in a given redshift range , per comoving volume .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure [ smd ] . to calculate this",
    "we perform a numerical integration between the limits of @xmath3 and @xmath70 .",
    "we extended the integration beyond the lower mass limit of our survey by extrapolating the schechter function to masses beyond those which we fit .",
    "our stellar mass densities are generally higher than what has been found in previous work , as shown in figure [ smd ] , due to our steeper values of @xmath71 .",
    "the black dashed dot line shows the stellar mass density history obtained from the integration of the instantaneous cosmic star formation history computed by @xcite , using the same imf as in our work . they show that at @xmath72 the line does not agree well with previous work which inferred from the integration of the stellar mass at these redshifts .",
    "the stellar mass densities that we calculate are higher than what has been found in previous works , but are still slightly systematically lower than the integrated star formation history line .",
    "we also computed the stellar mass density with a bright lower limit of @xmath73 and a faint lower limit of @xmath74 .",
    "the bright limit allows us to compare our computed stellar mass densities with the mass we can actually observe in all mass bins , and the faint mass limit allows a better comparison with the integrated cosmic star formation history .",
    "we find that when we adopt these bright and faint limits we see very little difference between these the computed stellar mass densities . even in the range @xmath75 , where the largest difference is found , the stellar mass density from both the bright and faint limit still lie within the errors of the original stellar mass density .",
    "the stellar mass densities found in this work can be compared to the local value of @xcite .",
    "we find therefore that by @xmath76 , 40@xmath77% of the stellar mass in the local universe has formed and by @xmath78 , 41@xmath79 % has formed .",
    "the growth of stellar mass does not alter dramatically after @xmath17 . at @xmath80 ,",
    "30@xmath77% has formed , and we see that at @xmath81 , 30@xmath82% is in place . the final stellar mass density at @xmath83 is 14 @xmath84% of the local value , although the results for this redshift range are not as robust as the others , as discussed in section [ sec : totalmf ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath85 , we see that the stellar mass density changes only slightly , hence there is very little change in stellar mass over this time period .",
    "we also note the stellar mass forms quickly as roughly one third of the stellar mass is already formed when the universe is only 2.3 gyrs old .",
    "figure [ smdbr ] shows the stellar mass density for the blue and red galaxy populations , with the total stellar mass density shown in black .",
    "we see a large decrease in the mass density for the red galaxies , yet for the blue galaxies the stellar mass density is consistent with being constant over this redshift range .",
    "this is seen in other studies such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who combined find very little evolution in the blue stellar mass functions as far out as redshift of @xmath86 . for the red population",
    "the numbers themselves are not as robust due to the poor fitting , but the different evolution of the red galaxies is clear .",
    "this growth in stellar mass density in the red population is consistent with other works such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is a large amount of research exploring the stellar mass function over a large range in redshifts , from @xmath87 .",
    "what is unique about the gns , and this work in particular , is the depth and redshift range provided by the data .",
    "a large number of surveys ( e.g. cosmos , zcosmos and combo-17 ) previously examine the stellar mass function at a lower redshift range than the gns . for @xmath88 these surveys probe a large stellar mass range",
    "e.g. @xcite , with mass limits of @xmath89 at @xmath10 to @xmath90 at @xmath91 and @xcite , with mass limits of @xmath89 at @xmath92 to @xmath93 at @xmath94 .    for @xmath95 our stellar mass functions are complete down to @xmath89 , and for @xmath96 we find we are complete to @xmath97",
    ". other work , which probes a similar redshift range , does not probe the faint end of the mass function as low as we do here .",
    "for example @xcite has a mass limit of @xmath97 at @xmath98 and the mass limits of @xcite range from @xmath99 to @xmath90 over @xmath2 .",
    "we are thus able to examine stellar mass evolution at @xmath100 as a function of mass for the first time .      in all of the stellar mass functions presented in this work",
    ", we find that the high mass galaxies have formed earlier than the low mass galaxies .",
    "for the total galaxy stellar mass functions , as shown in figure [ totmf ] , galaxies whose stellar mass is @xmath101 are close to the local value as early as @xmath96 ( for @xmath102 the number densities are @xmath103 % of the local value at this redshift ) .",
    "these galaxies have reached the local number density by @xmath95 ( @xmath104% the local value ) .",
    "downsizing conventionally says that the high mass galaxies have stopped star forming before the low mass galaxies .",
    "however what we see here is galaxy  mass downsizing \" , where by the mass of the high mass galaxy is formed before that in the low mass galaxies .",
    "this is occurring at @xmath105 unlike star formation downsizing which starts at @xmath6 ( bauer et al .",
    "this means the majority of the stellar mass of a galaxy is already in place before the star formation largely stops .",
    "this suggests that it is not the star formation making the galaxy massive , instead it is some other process such as mergers , which we do see happening often at high redshift ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this mass downsizing effect is also seen for the halos of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ totresid ] also shows the relative ratio between the local galaxy stellar mass function of @xcite at @xmath10 and the number densities calculated in this work .",
    "the green horizonal line is how the ratio would appear if all the number densities were at the local value .",
    "the black line is a linear fit to the points from the lowest to highest ratio , hence its steepness correlates to how dominant downsizing is in that redshift range .",
    "we find that although at @xmath106 the gradient of the line is very steep , there is a generally decreasing trend with lower redshift .",
    "we find similar results for the red and blue mass functions in figure [ brmf ] , with the red population of @xmath107 galaxies being very close to their local number density in the range @xmath75 ( @xmath108% for galaxies in this redshift range ) .",
    "the evolution of the high mass blue galaxies towards the local value is slower than that of the red .",
    "we find that the blue galaxies with stellar mass @xmath101 are mostly present by @xmath95 ( @xmath109% for @xmath101 for galaxies with in this redshift range ) .",
    "this is because these blue galaxies are likely to evolve into red galaxies at some stage .",
    "we also find downsizing in the star forming and non - star forming mass function , where the star forming/ non - star forming populations behave very similarly to the blue / red populations .",
    "figure [ totresid ] shows various lines indicating the ratio between the local stellar mass function and the local stellar mass function with slightly varying parameters ( the coloured and dashed / dotted lines ) . for each line",
    "only one parameter is changed at one time .",
    "we see that between @xmath110 to @xmath111 galaxies in the mass range @xmath112 , have generally higher ratios , hence they have generally lower number densities relative to galaxies with @xmath5 and @xmath113 .",
    "this dip feature also seems to be present for @xmath114 , but is much weaker and shifted to the stellar mass range @xmath115 .",
    "the various coloured lines show the features of the mass function is not just an effect of the changing of the shape of the schechter function .",
    "the dip in the total stellar mass function has been seen before and can be explained by the differential evolution of the blue and red galaxy populations .",
    "this is consistent with studies such as @xcite and @xcite who find a dip in the total stellar mass function that can be fit by the combination of these two population .",
    "we also find this to be the case here , as shown in figure [ totcomp ] .",
    "we find that a double schechter function ( the black dash dotted line ) , computed using the parameters of the blue and red fits , matches the form of the total schechter function for all galaxies .",
    "the only large discrepancy occurs at the high mass end in the range @xmath116 , and this corresponds with a poor fit to the red mass function .",
    "@xcite find that out to a redshift of @xmath94 , a dip in the stellar mass function is observed not only in the total but also in the red and the blue stellar mass functions for @xmath11 galaxies .",
    "they find that the blue stellar mass functions show a dip feature that appears to become more pronounced between @xmath92 and @xmath94 .",
    "the also observe a dip in the red mass function that shows the opposite trend , becoming more pronounced at lower redshift .",
    "the fact that we do not see this feature in either the blue or the red mass functions tentatively suggests that any causes of the dip are perhaps not present beyond @xmath94 for these colour selected populations .",
    "figure [ totparams ] shows a general steepening of @xmath71 from low to high redshift .",
    "it is one possibility that the low stellar mass galaxies are formed early on , then undergo mergers where we know that these merger events happen at an early epoch ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these mergers form higher stellar mass galaxies and hence the the number densities of lower mass galaxies would decrease over time , causing @xmath71 to become less steep , as is observed .",
    "they could also fade , creating a less steep mass function .    in this work",
    "we generally find a steeper @xmath71 than previous investigations of the stellar mass function at high redshift .",
    "for example figure [ totparams ] shows we are steeper than both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also find a steeper slope than @xcite ( @xmath7 over @xmath13 ) and @xcite ( @xmath118 at @xmath119 then steepens to @xmath120 at @xmath121 ) . in this case , the higher stellar mass densities discussed in section [ sec : massden ] are most likely the result of the steeper slope .",
    "the depth of the gns allows us to probe deeper into the low stellar mass region , allowing us to uncover the steeper slope and higher stellar mass density .",
    "we test this by recalculating stellar mass densities with less steep values for the parameter @xmath71 , but keeping the remaining parameters the same as found in this work .",
    "we find that by increasing @xmath71 by 0.1 in the redshift range @xmath122 there is a @xmath123 decrease in the integrated stellar mass density .",
    "this decrease becomes @xmath124 when alpha is increased by 0.2 in the same redshift range .",
    "@xcite find @xmath125 in the redshift range @xmath122 and hence compute a stellar mass density of @xmath126 .",
    "using this value of @xmath71 we compute a stellar mass density of @xmath127 , which is within error of the value found by @xcite . since we can reproduce the lower stellar mass densities with a shallower value of @xmath71 , our higher stellar mass densities are likely a result of our steeper @xmath71 , and additional mass we see at the low mass end of the stellar mass function .",
    "we find that the steepness , and hence the additional stellar mass we see , is dominated by the low stellar mass blue galaxies we find . in section [ sec",
    ": err ] we test the effect of the errors on our number densities and find we can still reconstruct the schechter parameters well , thus errors calculated in this work are ruled out as being the cause of our steeper @xmath71 .    for the blue mass functions in figure [ brmf ] ,",
    "@xmath71 is consistent with being constant across the whole redshift range .",
    "there is also very little evolution of the parameter @xmath128 , and this leads to the relatively unchanging blue stellar mass density seen in figure [ smdbr ] .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who show that between @xmath92 and @xmath129 both the stellar mass function and the stellar mass density show very little evolution .",
    "this is also in agreement with @xcite who shows the parameters for the blue galaxies are virtually unchanged between @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "this suggests there is some process by which this stellar mass function is being replenished .",
    "we find that for the total mass function , the parameter @xmath117 stays roughly constant over time .",
    "this implies that the process which is increasing the numbers of galaxies at the high mass end , is doing so over the whole range of high masses above and around @xmath117 .",
    "however this is not seen with the blue galaxies , thus this effect is not part of the evolution of this population .",
    "there will be some degeneracy between the schechter function parameters , and hence by holding @xmath117 constant we may be affecting the results of @xmath71 and @xmath132 . to test the validity of the assumption of a constant @xmath117 we use a monte carlo simulation to see how the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath132 vary with @xmath117 . to do this",
    "we took the values of @xmath117 we obtained from the first fitting described in section [ sec : fitting ] and then varied these values between the extremes of the error on @xmath117 .",
    "this gave us a range of @xmath117 and we then repeated the fitting for each value in the range keeping @xmath71 and @xmath132 free , thus showing us how the other parameters vary .",
    "we also recalculated the stellar mass densities using monte carlo schechter parameters , the parameters and stellar mass densities are also plotted in figure [ mcparam ] .",
    "we only apply this analysis to the range @xmath69 as the final redshift bin is mostly excluded from the analysis as described in section [ sec : totalmf ] .",
    "we find that although variations in @xmath117 does produce a spread in the parameter results we still see the same general trends .",
    "we still produce steep values for @xmath71 , which in turn produce stellar mass densities that are higher than found in previous studies .",
    "we plotted histograms of the parameters and stellar mass densities and found that they do peak at the values found from fitting with constant @xmath117 .",
    "we construct galaxy stellar mass functions using 8298 galaxies detected in the goods nicmos survey , a hst @xmath0-band imaging survey centred around the most massive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "we use the stellar masses , redshifts , colours and star formation rates calculated from the h - band imaging combined with the acs @xmath135 data to calculate stellar mass functions over this redshift range .",
    "we calculate the mass limit of the survey and find that we are probing galaxy stellar masses down to @xmath136 in the lowest redshift bin , hence we are probing an unexplored region of the stellar mass function whilst maintaining statistically meaningful results ( @xmath27300 galaxies between @xmath96 ) .",
    "we correct for high mass bias , consider both redshift and stellar mass errors , and fit schechter functions to examine the evolution of the parameters .",
    "we also measure the galaxy stellar mass functions for a blue / red selection and one based on star forming / non - star forming galaxy populations .",
    "we also calculate the corresponding total stellar mass densities by integrating over the stellar mass functions at each redshift range .",
    "the major results of this paper are as follows :    * we observe stellar mass downsizing in all of our stellar mass functions .",
    "for the total galaxy stellar mass functions we see that galaxies at @xmath5 have reached nearly the local value by @xmath137 . even in the highest redshift bin",
    "it is clear that the most massive galaxies are very close to being in place .",
    "the same is true for the red and blue galaxies .",
    "* at all redshifts the blue galaxies dominate the low mass end of the stellar mass functions . between @xmath69",
    "the lowest stellar mass blue galaxies are close to the local value . *",
    "the total stellar mass function shows a dip feature in the intermediate mass range , which can be explained by the differential red and blue populations evolution .",
    "we see no such dip in the blue and the red stellar mass functions unlike some previous studies who have found this below @xmath138 .",
    "we suggest these features are not present at high redshift . *",
    "we find a generally steeper low mass slope for the total stellar mass functions than previous work due to the low stellar mass blue population that is probed by our deep data set .",
    "this results in a generally higher stellar mass density .",
    "* we find a generally higher stellar mass density , due to probing deeper into the lower stellar masses .    by constructing the galaxy stellar mass function we are investigating the mass differentiation in galaxy formation , and the way in which mass drives evolution .",
    "more work must be done to fully understand the similarities and differences between the formation of the high mass galaxies that form first , the intermediate mass galaxies who seem to show a decreased rate of formation , and low mass galaxies who are dominated by the blue population . large surveys such as candels and future spectroscopic surveys that could be performed with telescopes such as jwst and e - elt , will provide the quality of data required to continue advancing in this field .",

    "<S> this is an example of ` galaxy mass downsizing ' , and is the result of massive galaxies forming before lower mass ones , and not just simply ending their star formation earlier as in traditional downsizing scenarios , whose effect is seen at @xmath6 . by fitting schechter functions to our mass functions we find that the faint end slope ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , which is significantly steeper than what is found in previous investigations of the mass function at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this steeper mass function better matches the stellar mass added due to star formation , thereby alleviating some of the mismatch between these two measures of the evolution of galaxy mass . </S>",

    "<S> both blue / red and star - forming / non - star forming galaxies , and further find that red galaxies dominate at the high mass end of the mass function , but that the low mass galaxies are mostly all blue , and therefore blue galaxies are creating the steep mass functions observed at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore show that , although there is a downsizing such that high mass galaxies are nearer their @xmath10 values at high redshift , this turns over at masses @xmath11 , such that the lowest mass galaxies are more common than galaxies at slight higher masses , creating a ` dip ' in the observed galaxy mass function . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the galaxy assembly process may be driven by different mechanisms at low and high masses , and that the efficiency of the galaxy formation process is lowest at masses @xmath11 at @xmath12 . finally , we calculate the integrated stellar mass density for the total , blue and red populations . </S>",
    "<S> we find the integrated stellar mass density of the total and blue galaxy population is consistent with being constant over @xmath13 , while the red population shows an increase in integrated stellar mass density over the same redshift range .    </S>",
