    "for a given class of sources whose luminosity is accurately known , one may construct a hubble diagram ( hd ) from the measurement of their distance versus redshift .",
    "such a relationship can be a powerful tool for probing the cosmological expansion of the universe , but only if these sources truly function as standard candles .",
    "the cosmic evolution depends critically on its constituents , so measuring distances over a broad range of redshifts can in principle place meaningful constraints on the assumed cosmology .",
    "the discovery of dark energy was made using this method , in which the sources  type ia supernovae  are transient , though with a well - defined luminosity versus color and light - curve shape relationships ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1998 , 1999 ; garnavich et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "of course , one must also assume that the power of distant explosions can be standardized against those seen at much lower redshifts .",
    "the use of type ia sne has been quite impressive , so one may wonder why there would be a need to seek other kinds of standard candle .",
    "but the reality is that several important limitations mitigate the overall impact of supernova studies .",
    "for example , even excellent space - based platforms , such as snap ( scholl et al . 2004 ) , can not observe these events at redshifts @xmath11 . and this is quite limiting because much of the most interesting evolution of the universe occurred well before this epoch .",
    "in addition , the determination of the supernova luminosity can not be carried out independently of the assumed cosmology , so the type ia sn data tend to be compliant to the adopted expansion scenario ( melia 2012a ) .",
    "the fact that so - called  nuisance \" parameters associated with the data need to be optimized along with the variables in the model itself weakens any comparative analysis between competing cosmologies .",
    "there is therefore much more to learn about the universe s history than one can infer from type ia sne alone .    in recent years",
    ", several other classes of source have been proposed as possible standard candles in their own right .",
    "most recently , the discovery that high-@xmath12 quasars appear to be accreting at close to their eddington limit ( see , e.g. , willott et al .",
    "2010 ) , has made it possible to begin using them to construct an hd at redshifts beyond @xmath13 ( melia 2012b ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be suitable for constructing an hd at intermediate redshifts , @xmath14 , between the type ia sn and high-@xmath12 quasar regions .    the possible use of grbs as standard candles started to become reality after norris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a tight correlation between the burst luminosity @xmath15 and the spectral lag @xmath16 .",
    "some other grb luminosity indicators have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discovered a relationship between the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy @xmath17 and the burst frame peak energy in the grb spectrum @xmath18 , but the relation may be the result of selection effects ( see , e.g. , kocevski 2012 ; collazzi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "similarly , the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath19 is also found to be correlated with @xmath20 in the burst frame ( schaefer 2003a ; wei & gao 2003 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "ghirlanda et al . ( 2004a ) replaced @xmath21 with collimation - corrected gamma - ray energy @xmath22 , and claimed a tighter correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the jet half - opening angle , one may reliably estimate the isotropically equivalent energy @xmath21 and use this to infer a distance .",
    "liang & zhang ( 2005 ) introduced the concept of optical temporal break time @xmath26 , and discovered a strong dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath20 and @xmath26 without imposing any theoretical models .",
    "earlier , schaefer ( 2003b ) had constructed the first grb hd based on nine events using two luminosity indicators , and this was followed by bloom et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , who published a grb hd with 16 bursts , assuming that the burst energy is a constant after correcting for the beam angle .",
    "some authors attempted to show the hd for an observed grb sample plotted against a theoretical hd calculated using the same cosmological parameters ( e.g. , dai et al . 2004 ; liang & zhang 2005 ; xu et al . 2005 ) . these and other attempts at constructing a grb hd were made with only a small fraction of the available data , using only one or two luminosity indicators .",
    "unfortunately , all of them had error bars that were too large to provide useful constraints on cosmology .",
    "schaefer ( 2007 ) made use of five luminosity indicators and successfully constructed a grb hd with 69 events .    the feasibility of using this method became better grounded when dai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used the correlation found by ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004a ) to place tight constraints on the cosmological parameters . because of the current poor information on low-@xmath12 grbs , the ghirlanda relation necessarily depends on the assumed cosmology .",
    "other authors attempted to circumvent the circularity problem by using a less model - dependent approach ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004b , 2006 ; firmani et al . 2005",
    "; xu et al . 2005 ; liang & zhang 2005 , 2006 ; wang & dai 2006 ; su et al . 2006 ; li et al . 2008 ; qi et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ; liang et al .",
    "2008 ; wang et al .",
    "2011 ) . in the end",
    ", however , as is also true for type ia sne , the correlation must still be recalibrated for each different model because the best - fit correlation depends on the cosmology adopted to derive the burst luminosities .    of course ,",
    "even with the emergence of more precise luminosity indicators , one must still deal with several significant challenges when trying to use grbs to construct an hd .",
    "the luminosity of these bursts , calculated assuming isotropy , spans about 4 orders of magnitude ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , there is strong observational evidence ( e.g. , the achromatic break in the afterglow lightcurve ) that the burst emission is collimated into a jet with the aforementioned aperture angle @xmath25 ( levinson & eichler 1993 ; rhoads 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ; fruchter et al .",
    "when one corrects for the collimation factor @xmath27 , the gamma - ray energy tends to cluster around @xmath28 ergs , but the dispersion ( @xmath29 dex ) is still too large for these measurements to be used for cosmological purposes .",
    "for example , wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that the updated @xmath30 correlation has a large intrinsic scatter . and",
    "lu et al . ( 2012 ) presented a time - resolved @xmath31 correlation analysis and showed that the scatter of the correlation is comparable to that of the time - integrated relation .",
    "so in the end , theses luminosity correlations may also not be suitable for cosmological purposes .",
    "this is why much effort has been expended since 2004 in finding other indicators from the grb spectrum that provide more precise constraints on the luminosity .",
    "one useful application of these ideas involves the use of @xmath20 and @xmath26 ( the so - called jet break time ) as a measure of @xmath25 to determine @xmath21 ( liang & zhang 2005 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will follow this approach with two distinct goals in mind .",
    "first , several new grb events have been detected in recent years that have spectral and lightcurve features ( such as @xmath26 ) with sufficient quality to help improve the previously assembled correlations .",
    "second , and foremost , we wish to use this relatively new probe of the universe s expansion to directly test the @xmath4 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) against the data and to see how its predictions compare with those of the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the @xmath4 universe is a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology that strictly adheres to the simultaneous requirements of both the cosmological principle and weyl s postulate . whereas @xmath0cdm guesses the constituents of the universe and their equation of state , and then predicts the expansion rate as a function of time , @xmath4 acknowledges the fact that no matter what these constituents are , the total energy density in the universe gives rise to a gravitational horizon coincident with the better known hubble radius .",
    "but because this radius is therefore a proper distance , the application of weyl s postulate forces it to always equal @xmath32 .",
    "thus , on every time slice , the energy density must partition itself among its various constituents in such a way as to always adhere to this constraint , which also guarantees that the expansion rate be constant in time .",
    "as we shall see , with all its complexity , @xmath0cdm actually mimics the @xmath4 universe when its free parameters are optimized to produce a best fit to the cosmological data .    in the next section",
    ", we will describe the data we will use and our method of analysis .",
    "we will then first assemble the grb hd in the context of the standard model , @xmath0cdm , and demonstrate that the best - fit parameters obtained by fitting its predicted luminosity distance to the grb observations very closely mirror those obtained through the analysis of type ia sne . in   4 , we will introduce the @xmath4 universe and provide a brief overview of its current status as a viable cosmology .",
    "we will then construct the grb hd for this expansion scenario , which is much easier to do than for @xmath0cdm because the former has only one free parameter  the hubble constant @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we will directly compare the results of our fits to the data with both @xmath0cdm and @xmath4 .",
    "our grb sample includes 33 bursts with a measurement of the redshift _ z _ , the spectral peak energy @xmath20 , and the jet break time @xmath26 seen in the optical afterglow . in assembling this sample",
    ", we required that the members have an independent _ z _ , that a spectral fit be available , and that a jet - break characteristic be present in the optical band lightcurve .",
    "note that in order to preserve homogeneity , we did not include those bursts whose afterglow break times were observed in the radio band ( e.g. , grb 970508 ) or in the x - ray band ( e.g. , grbs 050318 , 050505 , 051022 , 060124 , 060210 ) but were not seen in the optical band .",
    "we also excluded those bursts whose _ z _ or @xmath20 were not directly measured . for example , because of the narrowness of the _ swift_/bat band , the spectrum of grb 050904 can be described using a simple power law ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) , so we do not know the real @xmath20 . some bursts with reported _ z _ and @xmath20",
    "were also not included for a variety of reasons : grb 050820a does not have a well measured @xmath26 ; there is only one observed datum in the last decay phase of its optical lightcurve ( see fig . 4 of cenko et al .",
    "the optical lightcurve of grb 060418 is characterized by an initial sharp rise , peaking at 100 @xmath34 200 s , with a subsequent power - law decay ( molinari et al .",
    "grb 060418 does not have a jet - break characteristic .",
    "racusin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the observed afterglow of grb 080319b can be interpreted using a two - component jet model , so this burst may not be a  gold \" jet - break burst .",
    "grb 090323 , grb 090328 , and grb 090902b do not have clear jet - break characteristics in their optical band ( see figs . 2 , 4 , and 6 of cenko",
    "et al . 2011 ) .",
    "grb 090926a is one of the brightest long bursts detected by the gbm and lat instruments on fermi with high - energy events up to @xmath35 20 gev .",
    "this burst shows an extra hard component in its integrated spectrum , whose break energy is around 1.4 gev .",
    "the integrated spectrum can be well fitted by two band functions ( ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ) , so the real @xmath20 is confusing .    in summary , we were able to synthesize a sample of 33 high - quality bursts .",
    "all of these data were obtained from previously published studies .",
    "our complete sample is shown in table 1 , which includes the following information for each grb : ( 1 ) its name ; ( 2 ) the redshift ; and various spectral fitting parameters , including ( 3 ) the spectral peak energy @xmath20 ( with corresponding error @xmath36 ) , ( 4 ) the low - energy photon index @xmath37 , ( 5 ) the high - energy photon index @xmath38 ; ( 6 ) the @xmath39-ray fluence @xmath40 ( with error @xmath41 ) ; ( 7 ) the observed energy band ; and ( 8) the jet break time @xmath26 ( with error @xmath42 ) .    with the data listed in table 1 , we calculate the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy ( @xmath21 ) using @xmath43 where @xmath40 is the measured gamma - ray fluence",
    ", @xmath44 is the luminosity distance at redshift _ z _ , and @xmath45 is the @xmath45-correction factor used to correct the gamma - ray fluence measured within the observed bandpass ( taken to be @xmath46 kev in this paper ) and shift it into the corresponding bandpass seen in the cosmological rest frame .",
    "both @xmath0cdm and @xmath4 are friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , but the former assumes specific constitutents in the density , written as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the energy densities for radiation , matter ( both luminous and dark ) and the cosmological constant . these densities are often written in terms of today s critical density , @xmath51 , represented as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in a flat universe with zero spatial curvature , the total scaled energy density is @xmath55 . in @xmath4 , on the other hand , the only constraint is the total equation of state @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . later in this paper , we will discuss how these two formulations are related to each other , particularly how the constraint @xmath57 uniquely forces @xmath58 in @xmath0cdm when @xmath59 ( melia 2012c ) .    in @xmath0cdm ,",
    "the luminosity distance is given as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the speed of light , and @xmath62 is the hubble constant at the present time .",
    "in this equation , @xmath63 is defined similarly to @xmath64 and represents the spatial curvature of the universe  appearing as a term proportional to the spatial curvature constant @xmath65 in the friedmann equation . also , @xmath66 is @xmath67 when @xmath68 and @xmath69 when @xmath70 . for a flat universe with @xmath71 , equation ( 2 )",

    "the contours show that at the @xmath2 level , @xmath143 , but @xmath115 is poorly constrained ; only an upper limit of @xmath144 can be set at this confidence level .",

    "the best fit values are @xmath147 .",
    "in the previous section , we considered how the currently available sample of grb events with spectral and lightcurve characteristics appropriate for cosmological work may be used to constrain the principal parameters of the standard model .",

    "there is therefore no need to reproduce the kind of parameter optimization for @xmath4 that was carried out for @xmath0cdm in   3 .",
    "but before we proceed to compare the hubble diagrams for the @xmath4 universe and the optimized @xmath0cdm model , we will first briefly summarize the @xmath4 cosmology , which is not yet as well known as @xmath0cdm .",
    "one may look at the expansion of the universe in several ways . from the perspective of the standard model , one guesses the constituents and their equation of state and",
    "then solves the dynamical equations to determine the expansion rate as a function of time .",
    "the second is to use symmetry arguments and our knowledge of the properties of a gravitational horizon in general relativity ( gr ) to determine the spacetime curvature , and thereby the expansion rate , strictly from just the value of the total energy density @xmath148 and the implied geometry , without necessarily having to worry about the specifics of the constituents that make up the density itself .",
    "this is the approach adopted by @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "what matters is @xmath148 and the overall equation of state @xmath56 , in terms of the total pressure @xmath149 and total energy density @xmath148 . in @xmath0cdm",
    ", one assumes @xmath150 , i.e. , that the principal constituents are matter , radiation , and an unknown dark energy , and then infers @xmath151 from the equations of state assigned to each of these constituents . in @xmath4",
    ", it is the aforementioned symmetries and other constraints from gr that uniquely fix @xmath151 .",
    "both @xmath0cdm and @xmath4 are friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , but in the latter , weyl s postulate takes on a more important role than has been considered before ( melia & shevchuk 2012 ) .",
    "there is no modification to gr , and the cosmological principle is adopted from the start , just like any other frw cosmology .",
    "however , weyl s postulate adds a very important ingredient .",
    "most workers assume that weyl s postulate is already incorporated into all frw metrics , but actually it is only partially incorporated .",
    "simply stated , weyl s postulate says that any proper distance @xmath152 must be the product of a universal expansion factor @xmath153 and an unchanging co - moving radius @xmath154 , such that @xmath155 .",
    "the conventional way of writing an frw metric adopts this coordinate definition , along with the cosmic time @xmath156 .",
    "but what is often overlooked is the fact that the gravitational radius , @xmath157 ( see equation  4 ) , which has the same definition as the schwarzschild radius , and actually coincides with the better known hubble radius , is in fact itself a proper distance too ( see also melia & abdelqader 2009 ) . and",
    "when one forces this radius to comply with weyl s postulate , there is only one possible choice for @xmath153 , i.e. , @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the current age of the universe .",
    "this also leads to the result that the gravitational radius must be receding from us at speed @xmath61 , which is in fact how the hubble radius was defined in the first place , even before it was recognized as another manifestation of the gravitational horizon .",
    "the principal difference between @xmath0cdm and @xmath4 is how they handle @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in the @xmath4 cosmology , the fact that @xmath160 requires that the total pressure @xmath149 be given as @xmath161 .",
    "the consequence of this is that quantities such as the luminosity distance and the redshift dependence of the hubble constant @xmath162 , take on very simple , analytical forms ( as we have already seen in equation  4 ) .",
    "though we wo nt need it here , we also mention that the evolution of @xmath163 in the @xmath4 universe goes as @xmath164 another very simple and elegant expression that is not available in @xmath0cdm . here , @xmath12 is the redshift , @xmath165 , and @xmath33 is the value of the hubble constant today . these relations are clearly very relevant to a proper examination of other cosmological observations , and we are in the process of applying them accordingly .",
    "for example , we have recently demonstrated that the model - independent cosmic chronometer data ( see , e.g. , moresco et al .",
    "2012 ) are a better match to @xmath4 ( using eq .",
    "17 ) , than the concordance , best - fit @xmath0cdm model ( melia & maier 2013 ) .    in the end ,",
    "regardless of how @xmath0cdm or @xmath4 handle @xmath148 and @xmath149 , they must both account for the same cosmological data . there is growing evidence that , with its empirical approach , @xmath0cdm can function as a reasonable approximation to @xmath4 in some restricted redshift ranges , but apparently does poorly in others .",
    "for example , in using the ansatz @xmath150 to fit the data , one finds that the @xmath0cdm parameters must have quite specific values , such as @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the critical density and @xmath169 is the equation - of - state parameter for dark energy .",
    "this is quite telling because with these parameters , @xmath0cdm then requires @xmath170 today . that is , the best - fit @xmath0cdm parameters describe a universal expansion equal to what it would have been with @xmath4 all along .",
    "other indicators support the view that using @xmath0cdm to fit the data therefore produces a cosmology almost ( but not entirely ) identical to @xmath4 ( see melia 2012c ) .",
    "as we shall see below , the results of our analysis of the grb hd produce very similar conclusions to these , i.e. , that even though the internal structure of @xmath0cdm would appear to be quite different from that in @xmath4 ( compare equations  2 and 4 ) , in the end , the best fit @xmath0cdm model essentially mimics the universal expansion implied by @xmath4 .",
    "in @xmath0cdm , the luminosity indicator , and therefore also the distance modulus @xmath171 , depends on the specific choice of parameter values ( for @xmath64 and @xmath172 ) . to directly compare the hd for @xmath0cdm with that for @xmath4",
    ", we will calculate @xmath171 and @xmath173 using the best - fit model , for which @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the data and best - fit curve are shown together in the left - hand panel of figure  6 .",
    "the @xmath128 for this fit is calculated according to @xmath176 where @xmath177 is theoretical value of the distance modulus , and @xmath178 is measured using the liang - zhang relation . also , @xmath97 is the intrinsic scatter obtained from the joint likelihood analysis , and @xmath173 is the error for each realization @xmath178 of the _",
    "n _ data points .",
    "ignoring @xmath33 , which does not affect any of these fits , the optimized @xmath0cdm model has two remaining ( principal ) parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath172 , so with 33 data points , the reduced @xmath179 per degree of freedom is * @xmath180*.    -0.3 in -0.5 in     the plot actually gives the impression that the fit is better than this @xmath181 would suggest .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that 5 data points lie more than @xmath182 away from the best - fit curve .",
    "removal of these data reduces the @xmath179 considerably , and may be an indication that either they are true outliers , or that the errors and intrinsic scatter are greately underestimated .    the hubble diagram for the @xmath4 universe is shown in the right - hand panel of figure  6 .",
    "both the data and the best - fit curve were calibrated using the expansion implied by this cosmology ( see column 5 in table 2 , and equation  8) . a hubble constant @xmath101 km s@xmath102 mpc@xmath102 was selected to construct the plot , though it has no bearing on the quality of the fit itself . in this case , since we are ignoring @xmath33 in producing the fit , there are no remaining free parameters , and the reduced @xmath179 per degree of freedom in @xmath4 is @xmath183 .",
    "strictly based on their @xmath181 s , the two fits are comparable , though some concern ought to be expressed about the possible contamination of the grb sample by outliers and/or the underestimation of errors and intrinsic scatter . to facilitate a direct comparison ,",
    "these two hubble diagrams are also shown side by side in figure  7 .    0.2 in    cdm and the @xmath80 universe .",
    "]    to determine the likelikhood of either @xmath4 or @xmath0cdm being closer to the  correct \" model , we use the model selection criteria discussed extensively in melia & maier ( 2013 ) . for such purposes , the akaike information criterion ( aic ) has become quite common in cosmology ( see , e.g. , liddle 2004 , 2007 ; tan & biswas 2012 ) .",
    "the aic prefers models with few parameters to those with many , unless the latter provide a substantially better fit to the data .",
    "this avoids the possibility that by using a greater number of parameters , one may simply be fitting the noise .    for each fitted model ,",
    "the aic is given by @xmath184 where @xmath65 is the number of free parameters .",
    "if there are two models for the data , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and they have been separately fitted , the one with the least resulting aic is assessed as the one more likely to be `` true . ''",
    "a more quantitative ranking of models can be computed as follows . if @xmath187 comes from model  @xmath188 , the unnormalized confidence that @xmath188  is true is the `` akaike weight '' @xmath189 .",
    "informally , @xmath188  has likelihood @xmath190 of being closer to the correct model .",
    "thus , the difference @xmath191 determines the extent to which @xmath185 is favored over  @xmath186 .",
    "the choice of proportionality constant ( i.e. ,  @xmath192 ) for @xmath65 is not entirely arbitrary , being based on an argument from information theory that has close ties to statistical mechanics .",
    "( more details may be found in melia & maier 2013 . )",
    "it is known that the aic is increasingly accurate when the number of data points @xmath193  is large . however , in all cases , the magnitude of the difference @xmath194 provides a numerical assessment of the evidence that model  1 is to be preferred over model  2 .",
    "a  rule of thumb used in the literature is that if @xmath195 , the evidence is weak ; if @xmath196 or  @xmath197 , it is mildly strong ; and if @xmath198 , it is quite strong .",
    "several alternatives to the aic have been considered in the literature , but all are based on similar arguments . a lesser known one , called the kullback information criterion ( kic ) , takes into account the fact that the pdf s of the various competing models may not be symmetric .",
    "the unbiased estimator for the symmetrized version ( cavanaugh 1999 ) is given by @xmath199 very similar to the aic , but clearly strengthening the dependence on the number of free parameters ( from @xmath200 to @xmath201 ) .",
    "the rule of thumb concerning the strength of the evidence in kic favoring one model over another is similar to that for aic , and the likelihood is calculated using the same equation  ( 20 ) , though with aic@xmath202 replaced with kic@xmath202 .",
    "a better known alternative to the aic is the bayes information criterion ( bic ) , an asymptotic ( @xmath203 ) approximation to the outcome of a conventional bayesian inference procedure for deciding between models ( schwarz 1978 ) .",

    ", the evidence favoring one model over another is judged to be positive for a range of @xmath205 between 2 and 6 , and is  strong \" for values greater than this .    with the optimized fits we have obtained above , these three model selection criteria have the following values : for @xmath4 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 . whereas , for @xmath0cdm , we get @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 . therefore",
    ", using the aic , one finds that the likelihood of @xmath4 being closer to the correct cosmology is @xmath212 , compared to only @xmath213 for @xmath0cdm .",
    "the difference is larger using the other criteria , which show that the @xmath4 universe is favored over @xmath0cdm with a likelihood of @xmath214 versus @xmath215 using kic , and @xmath216 versus @xmath217 using bic . in showing the results of all three criteria ,",
    "our principal goal is not so much to dwell on which of these may or may not reflect the importance of free parameters but , rather , to demonstrate a universally consistent outcome among the most commonly used model - selection tools in the literature . clearly , the grb hubble diagram favors @xmath4 over @xmath0cdm .",
    "interestingly , these likelihoods are very similar to those inferred from our analysis of the cosmic chronometer data ( melia & maier 2013 ) , which showed that on the basis of those data , the @xmath4 universe is favored over @xmath0cdm with a likelihood of @xmath218 versus @xmath219 , for these three model selection criteria .",
    "in this paper , we have added some support to the argument that grbs may eventually be used to carry out stringent tests on various cosmological models .",
    "earlier work on this proposal had indicated that the spectral and lightcurve features most likely to provide a reliable luminosity indicator are the peak energy and a proxy for the jet opening angle , which we have taken to be the time at which a break in the light curve is observed . in this paper , we have confirmed the notion advanced previously that examining correlations among these data can indeed produce a luminosity indicator with sufficient reliability to study the expansion of the universe .",
    "a notable result of our work , based on the most up - to - date grb data , is that a careful statistical analysis of these correlations and their optimization points to best - fit parameter values in @xmath0cdm remarkably close to those associated with the concordance model .",
    "we have found that the @xmath0cdm model most consistent with the grb hubble diagram has @xmath220 and @xmath221 . in the concordance model , these values are , respectively , @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( hinshaw et al .",
    ".    however , for @xmath0cdm the reduced @xmath181 is at best approximately 2.26 .",
    "a close inspection of the grb hd for this model reveals that about @xmath7 of the data points lie at least @xmath8 away from the best - fit curve .",
    "this may be an indication that some contamination of the grb sample is unavoidable , and that pure luminosity indicators may never be found for these sources .",
    "of course , it could also mean that we simply have not yet found the ideal correlation function , and/or have not yet identified the correct spectral and lightcurve features to use for this purpose .",
    "on the other hand , it could also mean that we are understimating the errors and intrinsic scatter associated with the data .",
    "additional work is required in order to better identify the likely resolution to this problem .",
    "a second principal result of our analysis is that , based on fits to the grb hd , the @xmath4 universe is more likely to be closer to the ",
    "correct \" model than the optimized @xmath0cdm .",
    "one of our goals with this work was to demonstrate the dependence of the data acquisition on the pre - assumed cosmological model .",
    "this appears to be an unavoidable problem with all cosmological data , except perhaps for the cosmic chronometer measurements which are obtained independently of any integrated quantity ( such as the luminosity distance ) that requires pre - knowledge of the universe s expansion history . by calibrating the grb data separately for @xmath0cdm and @xmath4 ,",
    "we have produced a meaningful side - by - side comparison between these two cosmologies , showing that the latter fits the grb hd with a reduced @xmath224 , compared to @xmath225 for the standard model .",
    "nonetheless , these high values also show that the use of grbs for cosmological purposes is not yet mature enough to carry out precision tests . however , in attempting to assess which of these two models is favored by the grb data , we have found that several well - studied criteria developed for this purpose all consistently point to the @xmath4 universe as being more likely to be correct than @xmath0cdm , with a likelihood of @xmath9 versus @xmath10 .",
    "another significant result of our study is the remarkable overlap of the two best - fit curves in figure  7 .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of a similar result from our earlier study of type ia sne , particularly figure  4 in melia ( 2012a ) .",
    "we believe that this is not a coincidence because several studies have now shown that @xmath0cdm is apparently mimicking the expansion history implied by @xmath4 . the most detailed discussion on this issue has appeared in melia ( 2012c ; 2013 ) . in these papers",
    ", we presented several arguments for why the optimization of the free parameters in @xmath0cdm always seems to indicate an overall expansion of the universe equal to what it would have been in @xmath4 .",
    "our final comment concerns the implications of this work on the use of type ia sne to study the cosmological expansion at @xmath226 .",
    "there is no question now that any comparative analysis between competing cosmologies must be carried with the re - calibration of the data for each assumed expansion scenario , particularly when using standard candles that rely on integrated quantities , such as the luminosity distance .",
    "the type ia supernova luminosity can not be determined independently of the assumed cosmology  it must be evaluated by optimizing 4 parameters simultaneously with those in the adopted model .",
    "this renders the data compliant to the underlying theory .",
    "given how much better @xmath4 accounts for the cosmological data , such as the angular correlation of the cosmic microwave background ( melia 2012d ) and the redshift evolution of @xmath163 ( melia 2013 ) , not to mention the grb hd we have studied in this paper , we believe it is necessary to produce a type ia supernova hubble diagram properly calibrated for the @xmath4 cosmology .",
    "only then will it be possible to properly compare the best - fit @xmath0cdm model directly with @xmath4 at @xmath226 .",
    "the payoff from this effort should not be underestimated .",
    "we would know for certain whether the universe is truly now accelerating , or whether it continues expanding at a constant rate , as it apparently has been doing from the beginning .",
