    "recent cosmological observations have revealed that the ordinary matter contributes to the only small fraction of the energy density of the universe , @xmath0 in terms of the density parameter , and the remainder comes from `` dark '' components , dark matter and dark energy , whose contributions are represented by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively @xcite .",
    "the existence of these dark components indicates physics beyond the standard model such as supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , but on the other hand , the non - standard physics is also considered to be imprinted in the ordinary matter ( baryon ) component . from the measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and light element abundances predicted by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , it is known that the baryon density of the universe is almost made only of baryons , and anti - baryons do not exist .",
    "but such observed amount of baryon asymmetry can not be generated within the framework of the standard model .",
    "thus , if there is an underlying physics beyond the standard model , the baryon density of the universe @xmath3 should also be explained by violation of the baryon number and cp built in the new physics , as well as the dark matter .",
    "in supersymmetric theory , which is one of the best motivated physics beyond the standard model , there is an interesting mechanism to create baryon asymmetry . in susy there",
    "exist many scalar fields as superpartner of the standard model fermion which carry baryon or lepton number . along some directions of the configuration of these scalar fields , the scalar potential is flat",
    ". thus scalar fields corresponding to these flat directions can develop to large field value during inflation , and subsequent evolution of the scalar fields naturally leads to baryon asymmetry . this is called affleck - dine mechanism @xcite , which we will focus on this paper .    on the other hand , global supersymmetry",
    "is naturally extended to the local supersymmetry , which inevitably includes gravity , that is supergravity . in supergravity there",
    "appear long - lived massive particles whose lifetime are typically longer than 1 sec and they decay after bbn starts .",
    "one is the gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton .",
    "gravitinos are produced in high - temperature plasma via scatterings of the particles in thermal bath and their subsequent decay may greatly affect the standard cosmology @xcite , or may overclose the universe if they are stable @xcite .",
    "another is the polonyi field , which is a singlet scalar field introduced in order to give the susy breaking masses to the superparticles , especially the mass of gauginos , in many models of susy breaking .",
    "generally the polonyi field has the large field value during inflation , and it begins to oscillate coherently with initial amplitude of order reduced planck scale @xmath4 when the hubble parameter @xmath5 becomes equal to the gravitino mass @xmath6 .",
    "it has extremely large energy density and its decay after bbn has catastrophic effects on the standard cosmology  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , supergravity may be the low energy effective theory of string theory , which is defined in 10 dimensional space - time .",
    "in compactification of such extra dimensions , there appear light scalar fields called moduli .",
    "generally moduli have the mass of order @xmath6 through non - perturbative dynamics associated with susy breaking .",
    "the dynamics of moduli fields and cosmological difficulty they cause are similar to those of the polonyi field , and we call them moduli problem @xcite",
    ".    there are some suggestions to solve the moduli problem .",
    "one possible way is to use late - time inflation and the subsequent entropy production in order to dilute the moduli abundance to cosmologically safe value .",
    "such late - time inflation is realized by thermal inflation models and concrete examples for are found in refs .",
    "the other way is to make moduli heavy enough to decay well before bbn .",
    "the modulus mass larger than about 100 tev is safe and such large mass is naturally realized in anomaly - mediated susy breaking models , where other susy particles obtain the mass of order @xmath7 tev  @xcite .",
    "but the scenario is not complete . in late - time entropy production scenario ,",
    "the preexisting baryon asymmetry is also diluted .",
    "the reheating temperature after thermal inflation is typically less than a few gev , and hence almost all baryogenesis mechanisms which rely on high energy physics do not work .",
    "the variant type of affleck - dine mechanism after thermal inflation may work @xcite and to the best of our knowledge it is only possibility to create enough baryon asymmetry in the presence of thermal inflation . in heavy moduli scenario , significant entropy released by the decay of moduli also dilute the preexisting baryon asymmetry .",
    "in previous works @xcite , it was assumed that affleck - dine mechanism can create enough baryon asymmetry which survives the dilution from moduli decay . however , in fact , for large @xmath6 ordinary affleck - dine mechanism does not work due to the non - trivial potential minima of the affleck - dine field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study whether the sufficient baryon asymmetry is created in heavy moduli scenario , such as anomaly - mediated susy breaking models or mixed modulus anomaly mediation ( or mirage mediation ) models @xcite .",
    "mirage mediation models are based on the concrete model of kklt flux compactification @xcite and the lightest modulus mass is predicted as @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the following we consider the typical situations where the modulus mass @xmath9 is of the order @xmath6 and @xmath10 as reference values , although we do not specify the concrete susy breaking models . the only assumption on which our analysis is based is the hierarchical relation between the gravitino mass and other susy particle masses . in both scenarios ( anomaly- or mirage mediation models )",
    "other susy particles have mass of order @xmath11 and hence the gravitino is considered to be as heavy as 100 tev . as we will explain",
    "later , affleck - dine mechanism for such large @xmath6 is highly non - trivial .",
    "one possible way to incorporate affleck - dine mechanism in anomaly- or mirage - mediation model is to introduce the gauged u(1)@xmath12 symmetry @xcite .",
    "but we pointed out that affleck - dine mechanism with large @xmath6 works without any additional assumption if the reheating temperature is relatively high @xcite .",
    "we examine these two scenarios and find possible parameter region in which the desired amount of baryon asymmetry is generated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , we briefly review the cosmological dynamics of moduli fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlyosc ] , affleck - dine baryogenesis in high reheating temperature scenario is discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauged ] , affleck - dine baryogenesis in gauged u(1)@xmath12 model is discussed .",
    "somewhat similar to this case , but the case without superpotential and q - ball domination is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : w=0 ] .",
    "the decay of moduli may cause another difficulty , especially lsp overproduction from the decay of moduli - induced gravitinos .",
    "we give possible solutions to this problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : remarks ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in general , a modulus field has the mass of order @xmath6 in the presence of susy breaking . in the early universe",
    ", the inflaton dominates the energy density and this vacuum energy also breaks supersymmetry . as a result the modulus field obtains hubble - induced susy breaking mass of order @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus , during inflation the modulus has very large mass and sits at the origin .",
    "however , this high - energy minimum does not need to coincide with the low - energy true minimum of the potential .",
    "in general , these two minima are expected to be separated by the planck scale and hence when @xmath5 becomes smaller than the modulus mass @xmath9 , the modulus field begins to oscillate with the initial amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "this coherent oscillation of the modulus field has the energy density @xmath14 initially , and the total energy density of the universe is given by @xmath15 .",
    "we can see that the modulus has inevitably large energy density comparable to the total energy density and dominates the universe as soon as inflaton decays ( in the case of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the decay rate of the inflaton ) or the modulus field begins to oscillate ( in the case of @xmath18 ) .    in the case of @xmath16 where inflaton decays after the moduli start to oscillate",
    ", the moduli - to - entropy ratio is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the reheating temperature from inflaton decay .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath21 , it is given by @xmath22 in both cases the moduli abundance largely exceeds the critical density of the universe , @xmath23 gev .",
    "if we parametrize the decay width of the modulus as @xmath24 the decay temperature of moduli @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 hence , the decay temperature of modulus typically takes a value from a few mev to a few gev for @xmath27 tev @xmath28 tev .",
    "the late decay of moduli with such large abundance has significant effects on bbn @xcite , cmb @xcite and diffuse x@xmath29-ray background @xcite , which results in strong disagreement with observations .",
    "but for the modulus mass larger than about @xmath27 tev , the moduli decay before bbn and do not spoil the success of standard bbn . the universe is finally reheated by the moduli with reheating temperature @xmath25",
    "in minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there exist some configurations of the scalar fields ( flat directions ) along which scalar potential vanishes in supersymmetric limit within the renormalizable terms @xcite . a flat direction is parameterized by the single complex scalar @xmath30 , which we call affleck - dine field .",
    "the affleck - dine field feels potentials from non - renormalizable superpotentials represented as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective cutoff scale and @xmath33 . including susy breaking effects , the potential for the affleck - dine field is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is @xmath36 numerical coefficient .",
    "there are other sources for the scalar potentials . as explained in sec.[sec : dynamics ] , the scalar fields obtain hubble - induced susy breaking terms such as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath36 coefficients  -term inflation @xcite , hubble - induced term does not arise during inflation @xcite . ] . here",
    "we assume @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , in high - temperature environment of the early universe , thermal corrections to the scalar potential also arise .",
    "these are @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of order unity , @xmath43 denotes gauge or yukawa couplings relevant for the affleck - dine field , and @xmath44 is a constant of order unity assumed to be positive , which is determined by the two - loop finite - temperature effective potential for the affleck - dine field .",
    "then the total scalar potential for the affleck - dine field is sum of them , @xmath45 let us summarize the dynamics of affleck - dine field .",
    "first , it is trapped by the minimum determined by the balance of negative hubble - induced mass term and non - renormalizable term , @xmath46 and tracks this minimum as @xmath5 becomes small . the important fact is that without the finite - temperature effect , the scalar potential has the global minimum at @xmath47 if @xmath48 is much greater than @xmath49 , which is the situation we are interested in .",
    "thus the affleck - dine field is eventually trapped by this minimum and leads to charge or color breaking vacuum , which is a disaster . but",
    "finite - temperature effects can save the situation . including finite - temperature effects ,",
    "when @xmath5 becomes equal to @xmath50 determined by @xmath51 the affleck - dine field begins to oscillate around its minimum of the potential .",
    "the important fact is that if the thermal log term dominates the potential and oscillation begins by this term , the affleck - dine field will be taken to the origin without trapped by the global minimum  @xcite . through the process of field evolution , the affleck - dine field receives angular kick from @xmath52-terms and results in elliptical motion around the origin .",
    "hence the baryon number is generated and conserved in comoving volume .",
    "in fact , as we will see , for high reheating temperature from inflaton and high field value , the oscillation starts when thermal logarithmic term dominates the potential and affleck - dine mechanism works well .",
    "note that although the resultant vacuum is meta - stable , the lifetime of the false vacuum is much longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "next we estimate the baryon asymmetry in the presence of a heavy modulus field . in the case of early oscillation due to thermal logarithmic potential , @xmath50",
    "is given by @xmath53 hereafter we consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 case only , because flat directions with @xmath56 are lifted by the superpotential of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents scalar field other than affleck - dine field and can not generate baryon asymmetry via affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "we need following constraints for this scenario to work .",
    "one is the condition that early oscillation occurs ( @xmath59 ) , this leads to @xmath60 for @xmath54 , and @xmath61 for @xmath55 .",
    "the other is the condition that thermal correction hide the valley of the potential around the true charge breaking minimum and this thermal logarithmic potential leads affleck - dine field to the origin .",
    "this condition is written in the form @xmath62 , explicitly , @xmath63 for @xmath54 and @xmath64 for @xmath55 .",
    "we can see that in general the latter condition is severer whenever @xmath65 , which is always satisfied in anomaly - mediated susy breaking .",
    "now let us estimate the baryon asymmetry in the presence of modulus fields .",
    "it is convenient to express the baryon - to - entropy ratio as @xmath66 the ratio @xmath67 is fixed when both the affleck - dine field and modulus field begin to oscillate . when @xmath68 , this ratio is fixed at the onset of the oscillation of the moduli , @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath70 , the ratio is fixed at the beginning of affleck - dine field oscillation , @xmath71 . from eqs.([modbaryon : hos ] ) and ( [ modbaryon : tr(n=4 ) ] ) or ( [ modbaryon : tr(n=6 ) ] ) , @xmath72 must always hold .",
    "thus if we assume @xmath73 we can safely focus on the case @xmath68 .",
    "but in some models based on string theory , @xmath74 might be possible . in mirage mediation model ,",
    "the modulus mass is predicted as @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "although in such a model @xmath76 is still possible , we mainly focus the case @xmath77 and briefly discuss about the modification in the case @xmath70 . the condition @xmath68 is rewritten as @xmath78 for @xmath54 and @xmath79 for @xmath55 .",
    "high reheating temperature from inflaton is not a problem as far as the moduli decay well before bbn and non - thermal lsps associated with modulus decay do not overclose the universe .",
    "in fact it is possible that non - thermal lsps from the decay of moduli account for the present matter density of the universe ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : remarks ] ) .      in this case",
    "the baryon - to - moduli ratio @xmath67 is fixed at @xmath80 where the modulus field begins to oscillate with amplitude @xmath13 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 . in order to get correct estimation",
    ", we must specify the decay epoch of inflaton , whose decay rate is denoted as @xmath17 . thus depending on @xmath17 , three scenarios are available : ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84 , ( c ) @xmath85 .",
    "note that in case ( a ) , at the beginning of oscillation of the affleck - dine field the universe already enters radiation dominated era and estimation of baryon number is somewhat different from the other two cases . before the estimation",
    ", we see the conditions when the case ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are realized .",
    "the condition that @xmath86 can be written as @xmath87 on the other hand , the condition @xmath88 can be rewritten as follows , @xmath89 which is satisfied for natural range of parameters . in other words , unless reheating temperature is unnaturally high , case ( a ) is not realized . the conditions ( [ modbaryon : hos > m(n=4 ) ] ) ( or ( [ modbaryon : hos > m(n=6 ) ] ) ) , ( [ modbaryon : m > gamma ] ) and ( [ modbaryon : hos > gamma ] ) determine which of the following scenario is realized .    in the case ( a ) , early oscillation begins in radiation dominated regime and the baryon - to - moduli ratio ( [ modbaryon : n_b / rho_chi(i ) ] ) is written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the effective cp phase .",
    "note that as far as the initial amplitude of the affleck - dine field is smaller than @xmath4 , it never dominates the universe at the instant of oscillation .",
    "we can estimate @xmath92 and @xmath50 as @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 . substituting these values and using eq .",
    "( [ modbaryon : t_chi ] ) , we finally obtain the baryon - to - entropy ratio after decay of the modulus field as @xmath96 in the case of @xmath54 flat direction .",
    "clearly this is too small and it is impossible that we obtain a proper amount of baryon asymmetry . for @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath97 it also seems too small , but dependence of the cut - off scale @xmath32 is rather large , so that if we assume @xmath98 the desired amount of baryon asymmetry can be obtained .",
    "it may seem peculiar that the cut - off scale @xmath32 is bigger than planck - scale , but our definition of @xmath32 includes some coupling constant , e.g. , even if physical cut - off scale is @xmath4 , the effective cut - off scale can be @xmath99 if the relevant coupling constant is @xmath100 .    in the case ( b ) , the modulus oscillation begins in radiation dominated era .",
    "the baryon - to - moduli ratio ( [ modbaryon : n_b / rho_chi(i ) ] ) is expressed as @xmath101 a straightforward calculation yields @xmath102 for @xmath54 case .",
    "obviously , this is too small . on the other hand , for @xmath55 case",
    "we obtain @xmath103 it seems possible that a proper amount of baryon asymmetry after choosing cut - off scale appropriately . but @xmath20 is constrained from the condition @xmath68 [ eq.([modbaryon : hos > m(n=6 ) ] ) ] . substituting eq .",
    "( [ modbaryon : hos > m(n=6 ) ] ) into the above equation , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath104 , @xmath105 thus we need @xmath106 to obtain enough baryon asymmetry .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath20 must also be as high as @xmath107 gev .",
    "this also satisfies the constraint @xmath108 .    in the case ( c ) , the modulus starts to oscillate in inflaton - dominated regime and then inflaton decays resulting in brief radiation dominated era followed by moduli dominated universe . the baryon - to - moduli ratio ( [ modbaryon : n_b / rho_chi(i ) ] ) in this case is expressed as @xmath109 for the @xmath54 case , we obtain @xmath110 which is extremely small compared with the present baryon density .",
    "when we apply to the @xmath55 flat direction , the baryon - to - entropy ratio is estimated as @xmath111 which seems successful .",
    "however , we need rather high reheating temperature which suppress the baryon - to - entropy ratio , due to the condition @xmath68 [ eq.([modbaryon : hos > m(n=6 ) ] ) ] . substituting eq.([modbaryon : hos > m(n=6 ) ] ) , the upper limit for baryon asymmetry is obtained , @xmath112 if @xmath98 we can obtain desired baryon asymmetry , and this indicates that reheating temperature should be higher than @xmath113gev . on the other hand , @xmath114gev is necessary in order to satisfy @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath116 and @xmath117gev @xmath118gev are the possible parameter region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : m_chi=1e5 ] ) .",
    "now let us turn to the case @xmath70 .",
    "as we explained , early oscillation to avoid charge or color breaking minima requires @xmath119 and hence this particular possibility arises only when modulus mass @xmath9 is much heavier than @xmath6 . , although moduli decay into gravitinos may cause cosmological difficulty , here gravitinos are also heavy enough to decay well before the bbn . furthermore lsps produced by decay of moduli effectively annihilates and do not overclose the universe ( or they become dark matter ) .",
    "however , the subsequent decay of non - thermally produced gravitinos may pose a cosmological difficulty .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : remarks ] . ] in this case , we can classify the cosmological scenario depending on the inflaton decay rate @xmath17 : ( d ) @xmath120 , ( e ) @xmath121 , ( f ) @xmath122 . note that baryon - to - moduli ratio is fixed once the affleck - dine field starts to oscillate , but resulting formula for @xmath67 is the same as eq.([modbaryon : n_b",
    "/ rho_chi(i ) ] ) .",
    "therefore the results of case ( d ) and ( f ) are the same as(a ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "only the case ( e ) slightly differs from ( b ) .    in the case ( e )",
    "the baryon - to - moduli ratio is expressed as @xmath123 which is slightly different from the case ( b ) .",
    "note that we have used the approximation that the moduli dominate the universe soon after the oscillation .",
    "the following calculations are similar , and the result is @xmath124 for @xmath54 case , where we have used the constraint @xmath125 in the second line . using the same constraint , for @xmath55 case we obtain @xmath126 similar to the case for @xmath127 , for appropriate choice of the cut - off scale @xmath32 and the reheating temperature @xmath20 , it seems that we can obtain a proper amount of baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , we should recall that the constraint @xmath128 narrows the allowed parameter range .",
    "in fact , the case ( e ) is not realized in the parameter region we are interested in .    in figs.[fig : m_chi=1e5 ] and [ fig : m_chi=1e7 ] we show the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio in @xmath129 plane in the case of @xmath130tev and @xmath131tev for @xmath55 .",
    "the latter case is naturally realized in mirage - mediation models .",
    "we can see that @xmath132gev and @xmath133gev are required in the former case . in the latter case where the modulus field is much heavier than the gravitino ,",
    "the constraint is weaker .",
    "note that in such a heavy moduli scenario gravitinos can be efficiently produced by the decay of moduli , and these non - thermal gravitinos also decay before bbn for @xmath134tev .",
    "lsps produced by the decay of those gravitinos may be harmful",
    ". we will discuss it in sec .",
    "[ sec : remarks ] .",
    "finally we must consider the effects of q - ball formation .",
    "the fluctuations of the affleck - dine field with @xmath135 charge grow and result in lumped condensate , called q - balls @xcite .",
    "the q - ball formation leads to many non - trivial cosmological consequences , and they highly depend on susy breaking models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as we have seen in the previous subsection , quite large cut - off scale @xmath32 is required .",
    "one may wonder this leads to large q - balls and invalidates the applicability of our scenario .",
    "however , as we will see , largeness of q - balls is suppressed because of early oscillation .",
    "the radius of q - balls is comparable to the hubble horizon scale at the epoch of q - ball formation .",
    "thus although larger cut - off scale @xmath32 tends to create larger q - balls , but higher reheating temperature @xmath20 , which causes earlier oscillation , tends to make q - balls smaller .",
    "now let us estimate @xmath136 .",
    "it is found that that for the q - balls which have developed via logarithmic potential , the total charge of q - ball @xmath136 is fitted by the formula  @xcite , @xmath137 where @xmath138 . applying to the early oscillation case for @xmath55 flat direction , it is estimated as @xmath139 for @xmath140 , and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "it is known that evaporation of q - balls in high - temperature plasma can efficiently transfer the charge of q - balls up to @xmath143 almost model independently @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in the most interesting parameter region , q - balls formed through affleck - dine mechanism can completely evaporate and have no further effects on cosmological evolution of baryon asymmetry .    in figs.[fig :",

    "it can be seen that in the interesting parameter region where @xmath145 is obtained , only small q - balls are produced and they evaporate in the high - temperature plasma .     as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath20 .",

    "the left side of the dotted line predicts @xmath147 and q - balls completely evaporate in high - temperature plasma . ]    , except for @xmath148tev . ]",
    "next we turn to another possibility that affleck - dine baryogenesis with large gravitino mass works with an extension of mssm to include some additional fields and gauged @xmath149 symmetry .",
    "because the global @xmath149 symmetry within mssm is anomaly - free , it can naturally be extended to local symmetry .",
    "but from the viewpoint of baryogenesis , it must be spontaneously broken at some high energy scale in order to create baryon asymmetry and not to contradict with terrestrial experiments such as proton decay .",
    "we briefly explain the model discussed in ref .",
    "first , we introduce mssm singlet fields which have the superpotential as @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 have the @xmath149 charge @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively , and @xmath155 denotes the @xmath149 breaking scale .",
    "they induce the scalar potential given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the @xmath149 gauge coupling constant and @xmath158 denotes the @xmath149 charge of the affleck - dine field .",
    "the second term comes from the @xmath159-term contribution . in the following , we consider flat directions which are lifted by @xmath55 non - renormalizable superpotential in mssm , such as @xmath160 or @xmath161 direction . in this model ,",
    "gauge - invariant superpotential which lifts those flat directions are given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are @xmath36 coupling constants , and the resulting zero - temperature scalar potential is written as @xmath165",
    "although the whole dynamics is somewhat complicated and we do not give the details here ( see @xcite for a detail ) , the point is that by using the additional @xmath159-term potential which does not exist in mssm , the affleck - dine field can be stopped at the @xmath149 breaking scale @xmath155 during inflation . if @xmath155 is smaller than the hill of the potential of the affleck - dine field @xmath166 affleck - dine mechanism works without trapping into the charge or color breaking global minimum .",
    "if we assume @xmath167 and we focus on @xmath55 case , this condition is equivalent to @xmath168 if the value @xmath155 exceeds this bound , affleck - dine baryogenesis can not work due to trapping of the affleck - dine field in global charge breaking minima , if thermal effects are neglected .",
    "we saw that in this type of model , the affleck - dine field stops at @xmath149 breaking scale @xmath155 until hubble parameter becomes of the order @xmath49 and oscillation begins . if @xmath155 is smaller than the hill of the potential of the affleck - dine field , affleck - dine mechanism works . in the case of early oscillation",
    ", the result is the same as usual early oscillation scenario considered in the previous section .",
    "thus we consider only the case of no early oscillation in this subsection .",
    "the condition to avoid early oscillation is @xmath169 thus we can safely set @xmath170 . the baryon number at the instant of oscillation of the affleck - dine field is given by @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "the baryon - to - moduli ratio is once fixed at the epoch of oscillation of the affleck - dine field , @xmath173 , and the final reheating comes from the decay of moduli .",
    "the result is @xmath174 which depends on seventh powers of @xmath155 . substituting the upper bound on @xmath155 [ eq.([modbaryon : vbound ] ) ] , we obtain an upper bound on the baryon - to - entropy ratio , @xmath175 which seems successful . however , it is non - trivial whether q - ball is small enough to evaporate completely .",

    ", it is found that such a decay mode generally has the branching ratio as large as @xmath243 @xcite and the late - decay of gravitinos generated in this way may cause another cosmological difficulty . in our scenario",
    "these gravitinos do not upset bbn , since they are also heavy enough to decay before the beginning of bbn . but lsps emitted from the decay of those non - thermally produced gravitinos may overclose the universe .",
    "the decay of such non - thermal gravitinos does not release huge entropy , because the energy density of the gravitino is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ordinary radiation .",

    "here we describe some ways to avoid the lsp overproduction problem in such heavy moduli scenario with @xmath74 .",
    "one possible solution is to reduce @xmath257 so that the abundance of gravitinos from moduli decay can be neglected .",
    "depending on the kahler potential and susy breaking sector , the branching ratio of modulus decay into gravitinos may have the helicity suppression factor @xmath258 compared with other decay modes @xcite .",

    "but in our situation this is not a problem , since the gravitino abundance is smaller than the radiation at the decay of gravitinos and hence the axion abundance generated from the gravitino decay is also smaller than the radiation energy density . in this scenario axinos",
    "should decay before bbn @xcite . otherwise , decay products of the neutralino spoils bbn .",
    "this requires the peccei - quinn scale @xmath266gev@xmath267gev , where the lower bound comes from the astrophysical consideration @xcite and the upper bound comes from the requirement the lifetime of the decaying neutralino into axino should be shorter than 1 sec .",
    "thermally produced axinos @xcite can contribute to the only small fraction of the energy density of the universe because the final reheating temperature is very low .",
    "the coherent oscillation of the axion is also diluted by the modulus decay and has neglecting effects on cosmology for @xmath268gev @xcite .",
