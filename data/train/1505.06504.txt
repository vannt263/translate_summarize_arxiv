    "when @xmath0 is braided @xmath13 admits a subgroup @xmath14 - the picard group of @xmath0 in which the invertible categories are one - sided @xmath0-module categories ( and the action on the other side is induced via the braiding ) . from @xcite",
    "it was known that @xmath14 is isomorphic to the brauer group of _ exact _ azumaya algebras , and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.7 ) it is proved that for @xmath15 , the category of finite - dimensional representations of a finite - dimensional quasi - triangular hopf algebra @xmath16 , any azumaya algebra in @xmath17 is exact .",

    "the brauer group @xmath19 of a field @xmath12 has a nice cohomological interpretation : it is isomorphic to the second galois cohomology group with respect to the separable closure of the field . in the root of this description",
    "lies the crossed product theorem relating the relative brauer group @xmath20 with the second galois cohomology group with respect to the galois field extension @xmath21 .",
    "this cohomological interpretation is possible to transmit from the relative to the full brauer group because every central simple algebra can be split by a galois field extension .",
    "however , this is not the case if we consider galois extensions of commutative rings , not every azumaya algebra ( over a ring ) can be split by a galois ( ring ) extension .",
    "though , instead of the crossed product theorem for the relative brauer group we have an infinite exact sequence due to villamayor and zelinsky @xcite involving cohomology groups for an extension of a commutative ring .",
    "these groups are evaluated at three types of coefficients and the three types of cohomology groups appear periodically in the sequence .",
    "if the ring extension is faithfully flat , the relative brauer group embeds into the middle term on the second level of the sequence .",
    "if the extension is faithfully projective , one has an isomorphism , recovering thus the crossed product theorem .",
    "in @xcite we constructed a version of the above mentioned infinite exact sequence for a commutative bialgebroid ( a coring which is an algebra that fulfills certain compatibility conditions ) and we interpreted the middle terms on the first three levels of the sequence . if @xmath22 is a commutative ring extension , then @xmath23 is a commutative bialgebroid and the new sequence generalizes the previous one .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce a cohomology for a symmetric finite tensor category @xmath0 , which we still call amitsur cohomology .",
    "we specialize it in three types of coefficients , one of which is the picard group of @xmath0 ( the subgroup of the brauer - picard group ) .",
    "for this construction we previously prove the following two properties .",
    "firstly , that for a symmetric finite tensor category @xmath0 the monoidal category of one - sided @xmath0-bimodule categories @xmath24 is symmetric monoidal .",
    "this should not be a surprise , because , as we cited above : @xmath25 for any finite - dimensional quasi - triangular hopf algebra @xmath26 .",
    "it is known that for any symmetric monoidal category the brauer group of it is abelian .",
    "therefore , when @xmath26 is triangular , i.e. @xmath17 is symmetric , we get that @xmath27 is abelian . secondly , we prove that the dual object for an invertible one - sided @xmath0-bimodule category is its opposite category and that the evaluation functor involved is an equivalence , whereas the coevaluation functor is its quasi - inverse .",
    "we then construct an infinite exact sequence a la villamayor - zelinsky for @xmath0 , which consists of the corresponding cohomology groups evaluated at the mentioned three types of coefficients which repeat periodically in the sequence .",
    "the interpretation of some of its terms we develop in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "it is known that any symmetric finite tensor category is equivalent to the category @xmath17 of finite - dimensional representations of a finite - dimensional triangular quasi - hopf algebra @xmath26 .",

    "the corresponding representation categories are equivalent , hence we have that any symmetric finite tensor category @xmath0 that is strong is the representation category of a modified supergroup algebra @xmath28 with a triangular structure @xmath29 .",
