    "the cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which describes wave propagation in the presence of second - order dispersion and cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity , is one of the most widely researched nonlinear wave models in physics .",
    "it was successfully employed to describe water wave dynamics @xcite , nonlinear waves in plasma @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , and pulse propagation in optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "the fundamental nls solitons are the most ubiquitous solutions of the cubic nls equation due to their stability and to the fact that a generic wave pattern typically evolves into a sequence of fundamental solitons in the presence of anomalous dispersion and kerr nonlinearity . in the absence of additional physical processes ( perturbations ) ,",
    "the fundamental solitons propagate without any change in their amplitude , group velocity , and shape .",
    "however , the presence of perturbations usually breaks this ideal picture , by inducing changes in the solitons amplitude , group velocity , and shape .",
    "dissipative perturbations due to linear and nonlinear gain or loss are of particular interest , since they are very common in soliton systems . in optical waveguides , for example , nonlinear loss or gain arise due to multiphoton absorption or emission , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , nonlinear loss and gain play an important role in many phenomena described by the complex ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation @xcite , such as convection and pattern formation in fluids and mode - locked lasers .    despite its success , the single nls equation is limited to describing a scalar physical field and is also unsuitable for handling generic broadband nonlinear wave systems .",
    "if the physical field is a vector , or if the spectra of the waves in a broadband wave system are concentrated about multiple widely separated wavelengths , the single nls equation should be replaced by a system of coupled - nls equations .",
    "indeed , in recent years , coupled - nls models have been employed in studies of a wide range of phenomena in fluid dynamics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , multiphase becs @xcite , and plasma physics @xcite .",
    "coupled - nls models are particularly useful in describing broadband wave systems , in which the waves are organized in sequences ( trains ) moving with very different group velocities , such as in crossing seas @xcite , or in broadband optical waveguide transmission @xcite . due to the large group velocity differences in these systems ,",
    "collisions between pulses from different sequences are very frequent , and thus play a major role in the dynamics .    in the current paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of two colliding sequences of fundamental nls solitons in the presence of dissipative perturbations due to linear loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss ( i.e. , a gl gain - loss profile ) . in the absence of perturbations ,",
    "the solitons amplitudes and group velocities do not change in the collisions .",
    "however , the presence of dissipative interaction due to cubic gain and quintic loss induces additional amplitude shifts during the collisions , whose magnitude depends on the initial amplitudes of the two colliding solitons .",
    "consequently , amplitude dynamics of solitons in the two sequences become nonlinearly coupled , and important questions arise regarding the nature of this dynamics . in three recent studies we showed that amplitude dynamics of @xmath0 sequences of colliding solitons in the presence of dissipative perturbations might be described by lotka - volterra ( lv ) models for @xmath0 species , where the exact form of the lv model depends on the nature of the perturbations @xcite .",
    "this potential relation between coupled - nls equations and lv systems is of great interest , due to the central role of these seemingly unrelated models in the natural sciences .",
    "while the importance of coupled - nls equations was explained in the previous paragraph , lv models are widely used in environmental sciences to describe population dynamics @xcite , in chemistry , to study dynamics of chemical reactions @xcite , in economics , to explain interaction between different technologies @xcite , and in neural networks , to compute neuron firing rates @xcite .",
    "due to the importance of coupled - nls and lv models , it is essential to further enhance and extend the understanding of the relation between them .",
    "moreover , a better understanding of this relation can be used for stabilizing the propagation , for controlling and tuning of soliton amplitudes and group velocities , and even for broadband switching .    in order to give further motivation for the current study and to clarify the importance of its results ,",
    "we provide a brief critical description of our three earlier studies of the problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the propagation of colliding soliton sequences in the presence of delayed raman response .",
    "we showed that amplitude dynamics of @xmath0 soliton sequences is described by an @xmath0-dimensional predator - prey model , but the results were not checked by numerical simulations with the corresponding coupled - nls model .",
    "furthermore , the equilibrium states of the predator - prey model were found to be centers , i.e. , the equilibria were not asymptotically stable . in order to resolve the problem of asymptotic stability in _ the lv model _ , we turned to investigate collision dynamics of soliton sequences in the presence of weak linear gain and cubic loss @xcite .",
    "we showed that in this case dynamics of soliton amplitudes might be approximately described by a lv model for competing species with quadratic interaction terms .",
    "stability analysis of the equilibrium states of the model yielded conditions on the physical parameters for stable propagation of two sequences with equal soliton amplitudes .",
    "numerical simulations with the full coupled - nls model confirmed stability at short - to - intermediate distances , but uncovered an instability at longer distances @xcite .",
    "the latter finding was attributed to weak ( second - order ) radiative instability due to the impact of linear gain on the two sequences . in order to overcome this destabilizing effect , we turned to study a different setup , where the soliton sequences propagate in the presence of weak linear loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss @xcite .",
    "we showed that in this setup , the lv model for amplitude dynamics contains quadratic and quartic interaction terms .",
    "the presence of linear loss was expected to suppress the weak radiative instability and by this to enable stable long - distance propagation . however , numerical solution of the corresponding perturbed coupled - nls model still showed instability at intermediate - to - long propagation distances @xcite .",
    "thus , the important problem of further stabilization of the propagation remained unresolved .",
    "moreover , due to the instability at intermediate distances , all the previous studies were unable to explore the possibility of achieving stable on - off and off - on switching , i.e. , the turning on and off of transmission of one sequence by a fast change of one or more of the physical parameters .",
    "in addition , the earlier studies were limited in scope to small values of the dissipative coefficients and to uniform initial distribution of soliton amplitudes and phases in each sequence .    in the current paper",
    "we address these important deficiencies of the earlier studies . considering propagation of two colliding soliton sequences in the presence of a gl gain - loss profile ,",
    "we observe stable long - distance transmission over a wide range of the gain - loss coefficients , including values that are outside of the perturbative regime .",
    "the stable transmission is enabled by the presence of linear loss , a sufficiently large initial inter - soliton separation , and the absence of significant initial position shift between the two soliton sequences .",
    "moreover , we show that robust on - off and off - on switching of one soliton sequence can be realized by an abrupt change in the ratio of the cubic gain and quintic loss coefficients . in addition , we extend the results to soliton sequences with periodically alternating phases .",
    "our findings significantly enhance the surprising relation between propagation of colliding nls soliton sequences and population dynamics in lv models .",
    "the results also indicate that the relation might be further extended to sequences of solitons of the cubic - quintic gl equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ models ] , we present the coupled - nls model for the propagation along with the reduced lv model for amplitude dynamics . we also discuss the predictions of the latter model for stability of propagation . in sec .",
    "[ simu ] , we present the results of numerical simulations with the coupled - nls model for long distance transmission , as well as for on - off and off - on switching .",
    "in addition , we compare the simulation results with the predictions of the lv model .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider propagation of sequences of soliton pulses in the presence of second - order dispersion , kerr nonlinearity , and a gl gain - loss profile , consisting of linear loss or gain , cubic gain , and quintic loss .",
    "we denote the physical field of the @xmath1th sequence by @xmath2 . in the context of propagation of light through optical waveguides , for example , @xmath2 is proportional to the envelope of the electric field of the @xmath1th sequence . in the absence of gain and loss ,",
    "the propagation of the @xmath1th soliton - sequence is described by the cubic nls equation @xmath3 where we adopt the waveguide optics notation , in which @xmath4 is propagation distance , and @xmath5 is time .",
    "the fundamental soliton solution of the nls equation with group velocity @xmath6 is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the soliton amplitude , position , and phase , respectively .",
    "we focus attention on the dynamics of two sequences of fundamental nls solitons propagating with group velocities @xmath6 , where @xmath13 . assuming a large group velocity difference @xmath14",
    ", the solitons undergo a large number of fast inter - sequence collisions .",
    "we now take into account the effects of linear gain - loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss as well as inter - sequence interaction due to kerr nonlinearity .",
    "thus , the propagation is described by the following system of perturbed coupled - nls equations : @xmath15 where @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the linear gain - loss coefficient for the @xmath1th sequence , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the cubic gain and quintic loss coefficients , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ crosstalk2 ] ) describes inter - sequence interaction due to kerr nonlinearity , while @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 correspond to intra - sequence effects due to linear gain - loss , cubic gain and quintic loss , respectively .",
    "in addition , the term @xmath24 represents inter - sequence effects due to cubic gain , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe dissipative inter - sequence interaction due to quintic loss .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that under certain assumptions , amplitude dynamics of solitons in the two sequences can be approximately described by a lv model for two species with quadratic and quartic interaction terms .",
    "the derivation of the lv model was based on the following assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the temporal separation @xmath27 between adjacent solitons in each sequence is a large constant : @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the amplitudes are equal for all solitons from the same sequence , but are not necessarily equal for solitons from different sequences .",
    "( 2 ) the pulses circulate in a closed loop , e.g. , in an optical waveguide ring . ( 3 ) as @xmath29 , the pulses in each sequence are temporally well - separated . as a result , intra - sequence interaction is exponentially small and is neglected .",
    "( 4 ) high - order effects due to collision - induced frequency shift and emission of radiation are also neglected .",
    "since the soliton sequences are periodic , the amplitudes of all pulses in a given sequence undergo the same dynamic evolution . taking into account collision - induced and single - pulse amplitude changes ,",
    "we obtain the following equation for the rate of change of the amplitude of the solitons in the @xmath1th sequence @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath30 ,    \\label{crosstalk3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 . note that eq .",
    "( [ crosstalk3 ] ) can be described as a lv model for two species with quadratic cooperation terms and quartic competition terms .",
    "the results described in the previous paragraph indicate that there is a relation between collision - induced dynamics of soliton sequences in nonlinear waveguides with a gl gain - loss profile and dynamics of population size of species with nonlinear competition and cooperation .",
    "alternatively , one may speak about a connection between the perturbed coupled - nls model ( [ crosstalk2 ] ) and the lv model ( [ crosstalk3 ] ) .",
    "this relation along with knowledge about properties of lv models can be used to develop ways for controlling the dynamics of the colliding solitons .",
    "a straightforward way for achieving this goal is by tuning of the linear gain - loss coefficients @xmath17 . in optical waveguide systems , for example , this can be realized by adjusting the linear amplifier gain .    as a particular example",
    ", we consider the important case where the values of the @xmath17 coefficients are chosen such that the lv model ( [ crosstalk3 ] ) has a steady state @xmath31 with equal amplitudes for both sequences .",
    "this case is of special interest , since in optical waveguide systems it is usually easier to control the transmission when the amplitudes of all pulses are equal . requiring that @xmath31 is a steady state , we obtain @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . substituting this relation into eq .",
    "( [ crosstalk3 ] ) , we arrive at the following lv model for amplitude dynamics : @xmath35\\right\\}. \\label{crosstalk4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath31 and @xmath36 are equilibrium points of eq .",
    "( [ crosstalk4 ] ) for any positive values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath27 .",
    "let us discuss the predictions of the lv model ( [ crosstalk4 ] ) regarding stability of propagation of the two soliton sequences . for concreteness , we choose @xmath39 , and require that the equilibrium points at @xmath40 and @xmath36 are stable nodes ( sinks ) .",
    "the stability requirement on @xmath36 , which is important for suppression of weak instability due to radiation emission , leads to @xmath41 for @xmath13 , i.e. , the solitons are subject to net linear loss .",
    "the above stability requirements yield the following conditions on @xmath27 and @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "as explained above , the lv model ( [ crosstalk4 ] ) provides an approximate description for collision - induced dynamics of circulating soliton sequences .",
    "the propagation is fully described by the coupled - nls system ( [ crosstalk2 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions . a key question about the collision - induced dynamics concerns the possibility to suppress the instability observed in numerical simulations in ref . @xcite .",
    "here we address this important question .",
    "more specifically , we show that the instability can be effectively mitigated by using a larger temporal separation value t , compared with the one used in @xcite , and by eliminating the initial inter - sequence position - shift , which was introduced in @xcite to avoid incomplete collisions .",
    "thus , the numerical simulations setup in the current paper consists of the coupled - nls model ( [ crosstalk2 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions and an initial condition in the form of two periodic sequences of @xmath46 _ overlapping _ solitons with amplitudes @xmath47 and zero phase : @xmath48 } { \\cosh[\\eta_{j}(0)(t - kt ) ] } ,   \\label{crosstalk5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "the temporal separation @xmath27 is taken as @xmath49 , compared with @xmath50 that was used in ref .",
    "four different values of @xmath19 are used : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , compared with @xmath51 that was considered in ref . @xcite . note that a value of @xmath54 is outside of the parameter range , where the perturbative approach leading to the lv model ( [ crosstalk3 ] ) is expected to be valid .",
    "the other physical parameters in the simulations are taken as @xmath55 , @xmath39 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath59 obtained by numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ crosstalk2 ] ) with initial amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for @xmath54 .",
    "the predictions of the lv model ( [ crosstalk4 ] ) are also presented .",
    "the agreement between the coupled - nls simulations and the predictions of the lv model are excellent . moreover , in all four cases @xmath62 tends to the equilibrium value of @xmath39 and the approach to @xmath39 is faster as @xmath19 increases .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath63 and for other initial amplitude values .",
    "note that the distances over which stable propagation is observed are larger by a factor of 6.67 compared with the the distances in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by a factor of 2 or more compared with the distances in ref .",
    "the fact that the predictions of the lv model hold even for @xmath19 values as large as 0.5 , i.e. , outside of the perturbative regime , is quite surprising .",
    "furthermore , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the shape of the two soliton trains is retained during the propagation despite of the magnitude of @xmath19 and the large number of collisions .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we investigated long - distance propagation as well as on - off and off - on switching of two colliding soliton sequences in the presence of second - order dispersion , kerr nonlinearity , and a gl gain - loss profile . using coupled - nls simulations and a reduced lv model , we showed that stable long - distance propagation is possible for a wide range of the gain - loss coefficients , including values that are outside of the perturbative regime .",
    "the stable propagation is enabled by the presence of linear loss , the choice of a sufficiently large initial inter - pulse separation within each sequence , and the absence of significant initial time - delay between the two sequences .",
    "furthermore , we found that robust on - off and off - on switching of one of the propagating sequences can be achieved by an abrupt change in the ratio of cubic gain and quintic loss coefficients .",
    "additionally , we demonstrated that the results can be extended to pulse sequences with periodically alternating phases .",
    "our study significantly enhances the recently found relation between collision - induced dynamics of sequences of nls solitons and evolution of population sizes in lv models .",
    "moreover , it indicates that the relation might be further extended to sequences of solitary waves of the cubic - quintic gl equation , at least in some regions of parameter space .",
    "finally , our results might find useful applications in nonlinear waveguides with saturable absorption for stable energy equalization and broadband switching .",
