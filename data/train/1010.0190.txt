    "the intermetallic compound zr@xmath0al has been of special interest as a nuclear structural material although a drawback of the material is embrittlement under certain irradiation conditions @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that nanostructuring of materials can enhance the irradiation resistance , e.g. for the intermetallic compound niti @xcite .",
    "one successful method to achieve nanostructuring in bulk materials is severe plastic deformation ( spd ) .",
    "the formation of the nanocrystalline structure can occur directly by grain refinement of the coarse grained material or by crystallization of spd induced amorphous material .",
    "for example , crystallization of the intermetallic alloy niti amorphized by severe plastic deformation can lead to nanocrystalline structures and by modification of the deformation path and the heat treatment , properties of the alloy can be tailored @xcite .",
    "bulk intermetallic alloys can be deformed severely using high pressure torsion ( hpt ) . for zr@xmath0al , it was shown that hpt at room temperature leads to a final grain size of approximately 20 nm , but amorphization of a significant volume fraction of the sample has not been encountered @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was observed that upon hpt deformation , zr@xmath0al exhibits inhomogeneous microstructures , as were also observed in the case of l1@xmath1 structured ni@xmath0al @xcite .",
    "deformation by cold rolling with intermediate foldings ( repeated cold rolling - rcr ) is an alternative promising deformation route to produce bulk nanocrystalline materials @xcite .",
    "the minimum final grain sizes that can be achieved for a material are often smaller than the corresponding ones after spd under high pressure ( e.g. hpt , equal - channel angular pressing ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , rcr can lead to amorphization .",
    "it is the aim of this work to study the effect of rcr on the grain refinement of zr@xmath0al and the behaviour of the refined material upon heating to different temperatures .",
    "crystallization of the amorphous phase is also of interest since the zr - al system exhibits several intermetallic phases ( cf .",
    "[ zral ] ) and the driving force to form the l1@xmath1 structure was reported to be rather weak compared to the one of neighbouring phases @xcite .",

    "zr@xmath0al was alloyed with an initial composition of zr with 27 at.% al .",
    "the alloy was homogenized at 1160 k for 24 h leading to the ordered l1@xmath1 structure with 10% residual zr@xmath1al and @xmath3-zr .",
    "the material was cut to sheets 10 mm x 10 mm x 0.8 mm in size .",
    "the thickness of the sheets was reduced to 0.25 mm by repeated cold rolling .",
    "then they were folded and again cold rolled until a thickness of 0.25 mm was achieved .",
    "this process was repeated up to 80 times . during rolling the alloy",
    "was placed between two spring steel plates .",
    "the deformed material with the highest strain ( 80 foldings , @xmath4 ) was heated to different temperatures at different heating rates in a differential scanning calorimeter ( dsc ) .",
    "for the baseline subtraction , the material was kept at the maximum temperature after heating until the exothermic signal was negligible to avoid exothermic processes in the subsequent run that provided the baseline .",
    "undeformed samples , samples deformed for 80 foldings and samples heated to 773 k and 973 k at 20 k min@xmath5 after deformation for 80 foldings were investigated by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "the xrd data were analysed to get information about the coherently scattering domain ( csd ) size and the crystal structure of the samples .",
    "the tem preparation was done by cutting disks suitable for tem preparation from samples of different states , subsequent grinding and dimpling and finally electropolishing using the same parameters as described in @xcite .",
    "acceleration voltages of 200 kv and 300 kv were used for conventional tem and high - resolution tem , respectively .",
    "tem analysis of samples deformed for 5 , 10 and 20 foldings reveals that already at these relatively low strains ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , grain refinement is clearly visible . at 80 foldings ( @xmath4 )",
