    "atomically thin @xmath0he film adsorbed on graphite is an ideal model system for studying strong correlation effects in two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermions . in this system",
    ", the correlation can be tuned in a wide range by changing @xmath0he areal density ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "intensive studies have been done especially in the density region around the 4/7 commensurate phase in the second layer @xcite .",
    "grafoil , an exfoliated graphite , is an adsorption substrate commonly used in these kinds of experiments because of its large surface area ( @xmath3 20 m@xmath4/g ) and moderate thermal conductivity .",
    "however , grafoil consists of a lot of microcrystallites ( platelets ) with mosaic angle distributions .",
    "thus , the experimental results sometimes suffer from the heterogeneity effects of substrate .",
    "for example , the non - exponential decay of nmr spin - echo signals recently observed near the 4/7 phase @xcite and the linear larmor frequency - dependence of transverse spin relaxation rate ( @xmath5 ) @xcite are believed to be due to such heterogeneity effects .",
    "therefore , it is important to obtain distributions of the platelet size and the mosaic angle spread accurately enough for each batch if possible .",
    "so far , there exist only a few experimental determinations of the platelet distributions , and it is desired to cross - check the results by different methods .    in this paper , we demonstrate that the mosaic angle distribution can be determined with good accuracy by analyzing continuous - wave ( cw ) nmr spectra and consequently that the distribution claimed by the previous neutron scattering experiments @xcite is not correct .",
    "the distribution of the platelet size in grafoil estimated from scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements @xcite is widely spread below 100 nm . the mosaic angle distribution of platelets was determined by the neutron scattering experiments @xcite as follows . for 2d crystals , the intensity diffracted at an angle @xmath6 by the bragg reflection with the plane @xmath7 is represented as @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are a normalization constant , the multiplicity of the @xmath11 reflection and the molecular form factor , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the debye - waller factor , and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the wavelength , 2d plane spacing for the @xmath18-reflection and a parameter defining the average size of the diffracting arrays , respectively . using the orientational distribution function of grafoil platelets @xmath19 , the instrumental resolution factor @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the angle dependence of the scattering intensity @xmath22 is expressed as    @xmath23    thus @xmath24 can be determined by comparing measured diffraction peaks with ones calculated through eq.([eq : nscat_int ] ) .",
    "_ @xcite assumed @xmath24 as the sum of gaussian and some constant    he adsorbed on grafoil for two different field directions : ( a ) @xmath25 and ( b ) @xmath26 .",
    "the points are experimental data for the @xmath27 21.5 nm@xmath28 sample at temperatures indicated ( from ref .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are calculated spectra with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist_nmr ] ) and eq . ( [ eq : dist_neu ] ) , respectively . ]    @xmath29    and obtained @xmath30 from their own neutron diffraction data for ar monolayer adsorbed on grafoil . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] , this has a large isotropic powder - like component @xmath31 in addition to the angle dependent term with @xmath32 .",
    "however , this is hard to believe since it is too isotropic judging from the existing ample experimental properties of thin films adsorbed on grafoil and of the substrate itself , e.g. , the thermal conductivity @xcite , that all show the significant anisotropy .",
    "in this section , we introduce a quite different method to determine the mosaic angle distribution of grafoil platelets based on an analysis of cw - nmr spectra of @xmath0he thin films adsorbed on this substrate . here",
    "we use the nmr data for the high density second - layer @xmath0he at very low temperatures , where the nuclear spins are ferromagnetically aligned along the direction of applied magnetic field @xmath33 , measured by schiffer _",
    "the nmr frequency shift due to the demagnetization effect is expressed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the maximum positive value of frequency shift , @xmath36 is the degree of spin polarization and @xmath37 is the angle between @xmath33 and the vector normal to the average plane of grafoil @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "since the inclination of each platelet about the average plane has two degrees of freedom , it is designated by two angular variables , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in the spherical coordinate with @xmath38 being the positive direction of @xmath41-axis .",
    "then , the nmr line shape about the field corresponding to the larmor frequency @xmath42 is represented as    he adsorbed on grafoil . the dashed , solid and dash - dotted lines are calculated spectra with @xmath43 deg , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 is fixed at 0.045 . otherwise , the same as fig .",

    "he adsorbed on grafoil .",
    "the dashed , solid and dash - dotted lines are the calculated spectra with @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 is fixed at 27.5 deg . otherwise , the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] . ]",
    "@xmath47    here @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the intrinsic line width .",
    "thus , @xmath24 can be determined by fitting the measured nmr spectra to eq.([eq : cw ] ) .",
    "we note that similar analyses have been briefly reported by previous workers @xcite for the @xmath25 direction .",

    "[ fig : distribution_new ] , which is much more anisotropic than fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] .",
    "the fitted results are shown by the solid lines ( red ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] .",
    "the fitting quality is remarkably good both for ( a ) @xmath25 and ( b ) @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to this , the small fitted value for @xmath44 indicates the appropriateness of the gaussian functional form for @xmath24 .",
    "note that there are small bumps near @xmath42 in the spectra for both @xmath33 directions which are not reproduced by the fittings in fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] .",
    "these are attributable to magnetization of the paramagnetic first - layer @xmath0he @xcite .    on the other hand , the dashed lines ( blue ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] are spectra calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist_neu ] ) , the distribution claimed by taub _",
    "they look nearly the same for both directions of @xmath33 because of the large isotropic component @xmath31 and do not explain the experimental data at all .",
    "we noticed that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , they represented the platelet inclination only with @xmath39 without considering the @xmath40 variation .",
    "we believe that is why their estimation of the mosaic angle distribution is unrealistically isotropic .    note that the fitting for the @xmath25 direction is very sensitive to the presence of the isotropic component @xmath31 , while that for the @xmath26 is not .",
    "let us estimate the sensitivity of cw - nmr spectra in determining the mosaic angle distribution in this method . in figs .",
    "[ fig : cw_param_delta ] and [ fig : cw_param_h ] , we plotted the spectra calculated with slightly different @xmath46 and @xmath44 values from those of the best fitting by @xmath52 deg and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the spectra are sensitive enough to discriminate such small variations of the distributions .",
    "the constraint that the spectra for both @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions should be fitted simultaneously with the same parameters enhances the sensitivity .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a useful method to estimate the mosaic angle distribution of grafoil platelets from cw - nmr spectra of highly polarized monolayer @xmath0he adsorbed on the substrate . by analyzing the nmr data taken by the stanford group @xcite",
    ", we have proved that grafoil used by them consists of two components .",
    "one is isotropic like powder ( about 5 % ) and the other is distributed in the gaussian function of inclination @xmath39 with a standard deviation @xmath54 deg .",
    "these values are much more anisotropic ( or 2d like ) than ones determined from the previous analysis by taub _",
    "@xcite who used the neutron diffraction data of ar monolayer adsorbed on grafoil .",
    "we have found that their integration of the angular distribution is inappropriate .",
    "the results shown in this paper will be valuable to elucidate intrinsic 2d properties from various experimental data for monolayer systems adsorbed on grafoil substrate .",
    "it is desirable to reanalyze their data with the mosaic angle distribution of eqs .",
