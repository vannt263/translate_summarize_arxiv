    "@xcite recently developed the notion of the _ galileon_. the galileon is a scalar field , @xmath0 , whose dynamics is described by a lagrangian that is invariant under galilean transformations of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constant .",
    "a celebrated example of a galileon theory is derived from the dgp model  @xcite . to see this",
    "one can compute the boundary effective theory  @xcite , and take a limit in which an additional scalar degree of freedom decouples from the graviton fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this scalar can be identified with the position of the dgp brane in the minkowski bulk , and its dynamics is described by a galilean invariant theory in the decoupling limit .",
    "the galilean symmetry is a descendent of poincar transformations in the bulk .",
    "most of the interesting dynamics occurs in this scalar sector , and one can study a number of phenomenological issues including , self acceleration  @xcite , ghosts  @xcite , and the vainshtein mechanism  @xcite .    taking the galilean symmetry as their starting point nicolis _",
    "@xcite showed that if we also require the field equations to be at most second order in derivatives , then a generic term in the single galileon lagrangian is of the form ^_1___1^_1 ... _ _ m^_m , where @xmath4 , the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "many aspects of the single galileon theory have been studied , ranging from phenomenology  @xcite , covariant completions  @xcite , and their interpretation in terms of the position of probe dbi branes  @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for early related work .",
    "the extension of this symmetry to two galileon fields has been recently developed  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . as with the single galileon this was motivated by modified gravity scenarios , and in particular , co - dimension two braneworld models  @xcite .",
    "the two galileon fields can be identified with the position of the 3-brane in a six dimensional bulk .",
    "generically there is no reason to expect there to be an internal symmetry linking the two brane bending modes since the brane can fluctuate independently along the two orthogonal directions normal to the brane .",
    "however , one could speculate that the decoupling limit of a rotationally symmetric , co - dimension two brane would correspond to a bi - galileon theory with an internal so(2 ) symmetry  the galilean symmetry coming from bulk poincar invariance , and the so(2 ) from cylindrical symmetry that remains unbroken by the brane .    here",
    "we take a slightly different view from previous work on galileons in that we do not concern ourselves with gravitational physics .",
    "instead we will consider galileons purely from a field theorist s perspective .",
    "the lagrangians describing galileon theories typically include higher order gradient interactions .",
    "higher order gradient terms play a central role in constructing sigma models with stable lumps , such as the skyrme  @xcite and baby skyrme model  @xcite , as they behave differently to the canonical kinetic term under a rescaling of co - ordinates .",
    "this allows one to evade derrick s theorem  @xcite , and so construct finite energy topological defects .",
    "these solitons have been used to model baryons , so naturally it would be interesting to extend these models , perhaps by introducing new types of gradient interactions to stabilise new configurations , or at least render them static .",
    "however , generically , such interaction terms will introduce the ghost - like instabilities associated with higher derivative field theories  @xcite .",
    "the nice thing about galileon theories is that even though higher order gradient terms are present in the lagrangian , the equations of motion are no more than second order in derivatives .",
    "thus the ghost problem is avoided , and one is encouraged to extend the skyrme model in new ways .    in this paper",
    "we keep the general structure of the galileon term , but we allow for the scalar to be a multi - component field .",
    "if we were not to impose any symmetry between the components this would lead to a huge proliferation of terms rather quickly , but by imposing an internal symmetry we are able to find a manageable set of terms .",
    "we start in sections  [ sec : sonf ] and  [ sec : sona ] by constructing terms that utilize real scalars with an so(n ) symmetry , before moving on to a complex scalar realizing su(n ) symmetry in sections  [ sec : sunf ] and  [ sec : suna ] . in section",
    "[ sec : derrick ] , we discuss derrick s theorem in the context of galileons . by means of an example ,",
    "we show explicitly how derrick s theorem can be evaded , and one can indeed use the higher order gradient interactions to construct static soliton solutions .",
    "this result is in contrast to  @xcite , where it was argued that galileon interactions could not be used in this way .",
    "the difference here is that we can consider multiple fields constrained to lie on a non - linear manifold , and so one can not consider field deformations orthogonal to the pre - defined target space we will summarize our results in section  [ sec : sum ] .",

    "for example , the adjoint representation of @xmath111 is the * 24 * ; so , if we want to know how many @xmath112 terms there should be , we need to consider = * 1 * ... , ie , there are two singlets",
    ". this agrees with the number of quartic @xmath113 terms in ( [ eq : sunadjoint ] ) , namely two .",
    "we have only explicitly shown results for symmetric multi - galileon in four spacetime dimensions , but it is clear how our techniques can be extended to any specific number of dimensions .    in galileon models , as well as the canonical kinetic term ,",
    "one finds terms with more than two derivatives .",
    "such terms behave differently under a rescaling of coordinates , @xmath114 , meaning that derrick s theorem allows for the possibility of stationary finite energy solitons .",
    "higher order terms in the action are not unusual in the theory of solitons , indeed , they are _ required _ in the skyrme model . here",
    "we are modifying the skyrme model , constructing static solitons using these galileon terms .",
    "to have an explicit example , we have constructed hedgehog solutions for the @xmath35 nonlinear sigma multi - galileon confined on @xmath94 .",
    "the static solutions we obtained possess topological charges , an encouraging sign for the stability of a soliton , but certainly not a proof , so we would like to conclude this paper by saying a word or two about stability . for a non - linear sigma model constructed out of a single galileon",
    ", it has been argued that zero mode excitations inevitably suffer from ghost - like instabilities  @xcite .",
    "those arguments do not necessarily apply here for the following reason .",
    "the act of constraining @xmath115 to lie on an @xmath94 is equivalent to adding a constraint term @xmath116 to the lagrangian .",
    "perturbatively this gives rise to a `` mass term '' @xmath117 , where the background lagrange multiplier @xmath118 depends on the @xmath115 profile .",
    "numerically , we can confirm that @xmath118 is always negative ; thus we come back to the same structure as kinks and skyrmions , where the zero - mode instability arguments of  @xcite do not apply .",
    "of course , to confirm the stability , extensive numerical studies are required that are beyond the scope of this paper , and which constitutes our future work .",
