    "with the decade - long work of sensitive x - ray observatories  and , a refined picture of stellar x - ray emission in our galaxy is now available ( for a review , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , many x - ray production processes in stars depend on metallicity , and this dependence has not yet been tested thoroughly . in this context , the magellanic clouds provide an opportunity to observe the metallicity effects . for example , the tentative discovery of x - ray emission from low - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) objects in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) was reported recently and the emission level appears comparable to that in the galaxy , constraining emission models @xcite . on the high - mass end ,",
    "a 26ks  exposure of the emblematic region 30 doradus was reported by @xcite , leading to the detection of 180 x - ray sources - a hundred being found in the massive central cluster r136 , with some of these sources displaying @xmath52 net counts and thus having a non - negligible probability to be spurious . from their spectral analyses , @xcite derived for the massive stars of 30 dor absorption columns of 110@xmath6h - atom@xmath7 , temperatures of 0.54kev , and absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities from @xmath8ergs@xmath1 down to @xmath9ergs@xmath1 ( the sensitivity limit ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that many , but not all , of the detected massive stars were colliding - wind binaries , which could be ascertained through further monitoring .",
    "furthermore , these authors found no clear  ratio for their sample , contrary to that for the galaxy ( @xmath10 , see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this conclusion may be reconsidered , however , because ( 1 ) a significant contamination by the x - ray bright colliding wind binaries ( esp .",
    "wr+o ) may hide trends intrinsic to individual massive stars ( but correcting this problem needs both optical and x - ray extensive monitoring , which is not available ) and ( 2 ) coherent  ratios are found only when x - ray luminosities are well measured statistically and are corrected by the _",
    "interstellar _ absorption , not by the _ total _ absorption .",
    "it should also be underlined that 30 dor is an extreme environment , more akin to starbursts than a good representative of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) population .    in the lmc , n11 is the second largest region , just after the giant region 30 dor .",
    "the less extreme properties of n11 make it much more representative of lmc regions and clusters of massive stars . besides , the lower concentration of stars implies less source confusion ,",
    "hence should lead to more reliable results .",
    "star formation has been very active in n11 , with no less than four recognized ob associations : lh9 , lh10 , lh13 , and lh14 @xcite .",
    "the stellar feedback has restructured the surrounding interstellar material .",
    "notably , the winds and supernova explosions of the massive stars in lh9 have gradually carved a cavity , giving rise to an expanding superbubble some 120 pc in size @xcite .",
    "this expansion has probably triggered the formation of lh10 at the periphery of the superbubble @xcite . in turn",
    ", the massive stars of lh10 are now beginning to blow bubbles @xcite , further triggering new star formation in their surroundings @xcite .",
    "n11 is clearly one of the best sites to study the interplay between stars and the interstellar medium .",
    "this interaction , often violent , produces x - ray emission . using a 30 ks _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter observation , @xcite reported the first detection of x - rays in n11 .",
    "this _ rosat _",
    "observation revealed the presence of extended areas of diffuse emission , with the brightest sources associated with the n11l supernova remnant ( snr ) and within the superbubble around lh9 .",
    "further investigation was performed with a 30 ks _",
    "xmm - newton _ observation , which provided the first detection of point sources in the field @xcite .",
    "while stars in lh9 remained unresolved , this _ xmm _ observation unveiled in lh10 a mixture of diffuse emission and point sources associated with some of the most massive stars of the cluster .",
    "a detailed x - ray analysis of n11 requires a combination of both high sensitivity and high spatial resolution , which became possible with our new , deep x - ray investigation of n11 , using the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. this observation will lead to several analyses , and this first paper discusses the point source population .",
    "the aim is to uncover the nature of the point sources , and to find whether the properties of the stars in n11 differ from similar objects in the galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the data and their reduction , section 3 introduces the catalog of x - ray sources and their global properties , section 4 discusses extended and point sources associated with massive stars .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our results .",
    "the _ chandra _ acis - i observations of n11 were made in six separate segments within two months in 2007 . as summarized in table[obs ] , the exposure time of each segment was 4249ks and the roll angle ranged from 130@xmath11 to 188@xmath11 .",
    "the pipeline products of the observations were reduced and analyzed using our own idl - based analysis tools ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as the official software for the interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ; version beta1 - 4.0 ) together with the calibration database ( caldb 3.4.0 ) and other publicly available routines ( e.g. , xspec v 12.7.0 ) . it should be noted that our detection procedure was shown to give results comparable to those of acisextract @xcite , and this was checked on this dataset by a quick run of that tool .",
    "we used the light - curve cleaning routine `` lc@xmath12clean '' to remove time intervals of significant background flares when count rates deviated more than 3@xmath13 or a factor of @xmath14 from the mean rate of individual observations .",
    "this cleaning , together with a correction for the dead time of the six observations , resulted in a total of 280ks useful exposure for subsequent analysis .",
    "a combination of source detection algorithms ( wavelet , sliding - box , and maximum likelihood centroid fitting ) were applied to unsmoothed data in three bands : soft ( s ) 0.52kev , hard ( h ) 28kev , and total ( t ) 0.58kev @xcite . briefly",
    ", the wavelet detection was first used to find the initial source candidates with a high threshold of local false detection probability @xmath15",
    ". then , background maps were constructed by removing the wavelet - detected sources and by conducting a median averaging or smoothing of the three input images on scales much greater than the point spread function ( psf ) to achieve an intensity uncertainty @xmath16 .",
    "these background maps , insensitive to the exact details of the construction procedure , were used to search again for sources , using this time a sliding - box algorithm ( the so - called map detection mode ) .",
    "finally , a maximum likelihood centroiding algorithm was used , still using the count background map , to derive the best centroid positions for the sources @xcite .",
    "this process was applied independently to each energy band .",
    "our final source list contains sources with local false detection probability @xmath17 at least in one band ( poisson statistics was used in calculating the significance of a source detection above the local count background ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the source detection depends on the size of the psf as well as the local background level and effective exposure , which all vary with position , especially with the off - axis angle of the detected sources .",
    "the source detection , though optimized for point - like sources , includes a few strong peaks of the diffuse x - ray emission , chiefly associated with the snr n11l , about @xmath18 west of the field center ( for more on this object , see sun et al . in preparation ) .",
    "some of these sources associated with peaks of the diffuse emission are detected in s - band only .",
    "once source positions were identified , source count rates needed to be estimated . to this aim , it must be recalled that the most precise effective exposure times are evaluated in narrow energy bands .",
    "therefore , we calculated the net ( background - subtracted ) count rates in four subbands ( s1=0.51kev , s2=12kev , h1=24kev , h2=48kev ) , and they were later added to form the rates in the broader bands ( s , h , and t ) .",
    "we thus first constructed effective exposure maps in these four subbands .",
    "the construction of these exposure maps assumed a power law spectrum of photon index 1.7 and accounted for the telescope vignetting and bad pixels as well as the quantum efficiency variation of the instrument , including the time - dependent sensitivity degradation , which is particularly important at low energies ( @xmath19kev ) .",
    "[ fig : exp_1 ] shows such a merged effective exposure map , illustrating the features of the bad pixel removal , ccd gaps , observation dithering , etc .   as well as the overall field coverage .",
    "in order to treat uniformly both strong and weak sources , source counts for each subband were then extracted within the 70% energy - encircled radius ( eer ) of the psf , whose size depends on the off - axis angle of the source in the exposure and of the energy band under consideration . a background correction using the background map constructed earlier",
    "was applied .",
    "finally , count rates were derived from dividing source net counts by their effective exposure times ( values at the source positions in the exposure map of the energy band under consideration ) , leading to equivalent on - axis values .",
    "it should be noted that the presented count rates have thus been corrected for the full psf and for the effective exposure , which accounts for not only the telescope vignetting , but also the degradation of the detector sensitivity with time .",
    "therefore , the actual number of counts in a detection aperture is not simply a count rate multiplied by an exposure of 280ks",
    ". the difference could be up to a factor of @xmath20 , depending on a source s spectral shape .",
    "we extract an acis spectrum for each source detected with @xmath21 .",
    "the on - source spectral extraction circle has the same radius as used for the source removal , while the local background spectrum is estimated from a concentric annulus with the inner radius equal to 2@xmath22 the circle radius and the outer radius twice larger .",
    "detected sources are removed from the background region .",
    "the background spectrum is normalized accounting for bad pixels and boundaries of the ccds as well as the source removal .",
    "we obtain the averaged response matrices of each source spectrum , using the weights derived from on - source 0.52kev band counts in the detector coordinates of individual observations .",
    "the spectrum is further adaptively binned to achieve a background - subtracted signal - to - noise ratio greater than 2.5 in each bin .",
    "we compared the positions of a few well identified x - ray sources with their ( known ) optical counterparts . to this aim , we considered only ob stars , since they are rather bright sources of x - rays , whereas no other stellar x - ray emitter was a priori known in the field ( though several other sources may have possible stellar counterparts , see below , but these were not a priori known ) .",
    "we found no significant systematic offset ( @xmath23 05 ) and therefore , no astrometry correction was applied to the x - ray data .",
    "we caution however that these sources lie at large off - axis angles , so that the uncertainties in their x - ray positions may be large , but the absence of bright x - ray sources with well - established optical counterparts prohibits us to fine - tune the astronometry to 01 accuracy .",
    "with the detection procedure described in the previous section , we found 165 sources in n11 : 43 of them were detected with the highest confidence or smallest @xmath24 value in the s band , 5 in h band , and 117 in t band . amongst these ,",
    "74 were detected in all three bands , 56 only in two bands , and 35 only in one band ( 22 for s , 2 for h , 11 for t - while the total band often maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio , some very soft or very hard sources are more easily detected in only the soft or hard band , for example , nearby stars and diffuse emission peaks in the soft band , and faraway accreting sources and agns in the hard band ) . table [ sourcelist ] lists for each detected source its position , count rate in the total band and hardness ratios @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , as well as its off - axis angle , number of counts , estimated background counts and _ effective _ exposure in the detection aperture and in the total band .",
    "the last column yields the band where the source was detected with the highest confidence .",
    "while count rates may look large at first sight , it must be recalled that the source detection completeness varies across the acis - i map , depending on the local psf , effective exposure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_1 ] ) , and background .",
    "furthermore , count rates have been corrected for ccd degradation , leading even more to apparently high count rates . without making this correction ,",
    "the interpretation of the hardness ratios or the count rate to flux conversion given below would depend on the time when observations were taken . the lowest value for source net counts and signal - to - noise ratio are 4.7 and 2.1 , respectively .",
    "the conversion from a count rate to an unabsorbed energy flux depends on the source spectrum and foreground absorption .",
    "a characteristic value of the conversion is @xmath27 @xmath28 in the 0.58kev band for a power - law spectrum of photon index 2 and an absorbing - gas column density @xmath29h - atom@xmath7 ( assuming solar abundances ) .",
    "this conversion should be a good approximation ( within a factor of 2 ) for @xmath30h - atom@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding conversion to a source - frame luminosity in the same band is @xmath31 @xmath32 at the lmc distance of 50 kpc .",
    "the acis - i total band ( unsmoothed ) image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x14_sou ] with the detected x - ray sources marked , while fig.[fig : rgb ] shows a smoothed three - color map of the x - ray emission in n11 as well as an h@xmath33 image for comparison .",
    "the smoothed images show that many point sources are superposed on diffuse emission . as the source detection",
    "is based on poisson statistics and the image smoothing uses gaussian statistics , there appear to be additional point - like sources ( to eyes ) in the smoothed images .",
    "these are artifacts of the smoothing procedure .",
    "we will not consider these false sources caused by noise bumps .",
    "we also conducted tests for timing variability .",
    "we first carried out kolmogorov - smirnov tests as well as @xmath34 tests on the total band light curves of the 41 sources with detected @xmath35 , which are well covered by the six observations . for @xmath34 tests",
    ", lightcurves were adaptively binned so that each bin contains at least 20 counts .",
    "sources j045509.20@xmath36663018.5 and j045702.07@xmath36662257.1 ( # 32 and 158 , fig .",
    "[ fig : timing ] ) show significant variabilities in the total band at confidence levels of 5 and 3@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "they possess no counterpart within 1  ( see sect 3.1 ) , and their nature remains unknown .",
    "variability examination in the s and h bands yields no additional results .",
    "the analysis of individual observations separately , for all 117 sources that are not near the ccd gaps ( with a 12  margin to account for the dithering effect ) in any of the observations , yields only one positive result : j045539.69@xmath36662959.5 ( # 64 ) shows an apparent variation in the s band during the observation # 8210 and at a confidence level of @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timing ] ) .",
    "this source is a known quasar candidate ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "however , with so many sources studied in two independent bands ( the third one being related to the other two since @xmath38 ) , this latter variability detection is not inconsistent with the occurrence of such an event by pure chance hence is marginal .",
    "figure [ hr ] shows hardness ratios of the 53 sources with both ratios known with errors less than 0.2 : most ( 48 ) sources have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , indicating relatively hard sources . to assess the contamination of the catalog by background agns , we have characterized the x - ray source number - flux relation ( nfr ) in n11 .",
    "this nfr analysis uses only the 141 sources detected in the total band , for homogeneity and to avoid biases towards soft or hard sources .",
    "eddington bias was corrected following the approach of @xcite .",
    "we may compare the derived nfr to the log(@xmath41)log(@xmath42 ) presented by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the x - ray absorption through n11 ( from nrao survey , @xmath43h - atom@xmath7 ) is substantially higher than that toward the  deep fields ( foreground absorption @xmath44 ) . correcting for this difference",
    ", we find an expected number of agns in the field of 91 ( fig .",
    "[ nfr ] ) , i.e. , most of our sources are in fact extragalactic background objects .",
    "indeed , a few agns have been identified in the field : a correlation of our source list with quasar tables in vizier results in the identification of sources # 11 @xcite and # 38 , 45 , 64 , 98 , 117 , 123 @xcite .",
    "note however that some parts of the nebula are filled with molecular clouds , and these locally enhanced absorption columns may reduce the number of detectable agns .",
    "counterparts to our x - ray sources were searched in several catalogs : usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite , guide star catalog v2.3.2 ( gsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite , magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and @xmath45 photometry of n11 young stellar objects ( [ hkn2006 ] , @xcite ) .    to find the optimal correlation radius ,",
    "we first searched for the closest counterpart to each x - ray sources and derived the number of matches as a function of radius : at large radii , the number of matches is proportional to the squared radius , as expected by chance coincidences . a best correlation radius of 1  was found , and used to derive the final list of counterparts ( table [ counterparts ] ) : 71 of the 165 sources have at least one counterpart within 1 . amongst these",
    ", thirteen objects are known massive stars ( see table [ deto ] and sect .",
    "4 ) , two are ob candidates ( # 130 and 136 , @xcite ) , and one is a haebe candidate ( # 63 , @xcite ) .",
    "two additional sources have been misidentified with stars in the past : src # 98 , proposed to be a haebe candidate on the basis of the photometry @xcite , is in fact a quasar @xcite , while src # 24 , identified to be a young stellar object @xcite , actually corresponds to the nucleus of a background galaxy @xcite .",
    "the photometric measurements of the counterparts appear coherent in different catalogs .",
    "we therefore focus on irsf , because it contains the largest number of counterparts ( 58 sources ) amongst the tested catalogs . considering the sources with full @xmath45 photometry available , color - magnitude and color - color diagrams",
    "can be constructed ( fig .",
    "[ hr ] ) . besides massive stars , counterparts appear to the right of the main sequence , suggesting that they are young , still forming stars",
    "; however , known quasars also have similar photometric properties , requiring additional investigation .    to this aim ,",
    "we further used h@xmath33 , [ ] , and [ ] images taken with the mosaic camera on the blanco 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory . the h@xmath33 observations consisted of three dithered exposures of 300s each for each location ; the bulk of n11 was imaged on 2008 december 5 and the periphery of n11 was imaged on 2010 january 9 .",
    "the [ ] @xmath465007 observations and the [ ] @xmath476716,6731 observations consist of four dithered 450s exposures for each location ; these images were obtained on 2011 october 31 .",
    "we have also used infrared observations made with the _ spitzer space telescope_. the _ spitzer _ images and photometry of point sources of n11 are taken from the previous work by @xcite , who made a photometric catalog and identified young stellar objects for the entire lmc .",
    "these images have been used for inspecting the counterparts to the x - ray point sources . among the three optical images , the [ ] image is the most useful because the diffuse emission from ionized gas is not as strong and confusing as that in h@xmath33 and [ ] . among the infrared images ,",
    "we have used primarily the 3.6 and 8.0 @xmath48 m images .",
    "figure [ map ] shows @xmath49 cutout [ ] images overplotted with error circles ( radius from column 3 of table 2 ) centered on the derived positions of all 165 x - ray sources .",
    "these images are useful for an independent confirmation or rejection of optical counterparts .",
    "although some of the error circles have radii @xmath50 , the combined errors in the x - ray and optical astrometry may reach @xmath51 .",
    "we have conservatively use a minimum correlation radius of 1@xmath52 for identification of optical counterparts ; however , only 3 sources ( # 43 , 78 , and 107 ) have optical counterparts that are within 1@xmath52 but outside the error radius . the results of our investigation are noted in table [ addcount ] , including _ spitzer _ counterparts of the x - ray point sources .",
    "to assess the physical nature of the optical and infrared counterparts of the x - ray sources , we have assembled spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the sources that have photometric measurements available .",
    "the following passbands and catalogs have been used : @xmath53 from mcps , @xmath45 from 2mass and irsf , and irac bands from @xcite .",
    "these seds are presented in figure [ sed ] .",
    "the seds of known massive stars , such as sources # 48 , 77 , 97 , 110 , 115 , 126 , 141 , 142 , 146 , and 157 , have a distinct shape that falls off toward long wavelengths , following the rayleigh - jean law .",
    "while the seds of stars can be diagnosed by their downturn in infrared , the nature of the stars need to be estimated from their photometric colors and magnitudes . for each object with a stellar sed ,",
    "we use the mcps @xmath53 and irsf @xmath54 photometry to determine colors in several combinations of bands ( such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc . ) , compare the observed colors with those of dwarfs ( luminosity class v ) and supergiants ( luminosity class i ) to assess its spectral type , and compare the observed magnitude with the expected absolute magnitude to determine its distance .",
    "we find that sources # 130 and 136 are b2 giants , in agreement with the suggestion of candidate ob stars by hatano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , sources # 108 , 139 , and 145 are late - type b dwarfs , and source # 106 may be of type a0 .",
    "distances that we derived for these objects are @xmath5950 kpc , and they are thus in the lmc . using the same conversion factors as for known massive stars ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) , the x - ray luminosities of these sources , in the total band , amount to @xmath60ergs@xmath1 for the three late - b and the a0 star , and @xmath61ergs@xmath1 for the two b2iii stars .",

    "such luminosities are too high for even flares of pms companions or flares of these stars themselves @xcite , but too low in comparison with those of known hmxbs in the lmc ( @xmath65ergs@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , such high  ratios are not compatible with embedded wind shocks ( such stars would not have the strong mass - loss necessary for this mechanism , anyway ) . in the absence of further information",
    ", it seems likely that objects other than these ab stars are the true x - ray emitters : chance alignment with foreground ( soft ) source or background ( hard ) source or localized peak in soft diffuse emission . in this context , it should be noted that # 106 , 108 and 130 seem to emit mostly soft x - rays , while the emissions of # 136 and 139 appear much harder .",
    "the cooler stars are all in the galactic foreground : source # 56 is a known k0 star ; sources # 5 and 28 are g stars ; 25 , 43 , 78 , 87 , and 109 are k stars ; 54 , 95 , and 107 are m stars . in two cases ,",
    "sources # 25 and 109 , the colors at long wavelengths suggest k spectral type , but the star appears too bright in @xmath66 .",
    "it is likely that they are sirius - like systems in which the k star dominates the emission in longer wavelength and the white dwarf dominates the emission in shorter wavelengths .",
    "the individual results of the stellar counterpart analysis are given in table [ addcount ] and a summary by category is provided in table [ countsum ] .",
    "agns and galaxies can also be diagnosed from the seds by their distinct shape that rises toward long wavelengths in the infrared @xcite .",
    "for example , sources # 11 , 24 , 36 , 38 , 45 , 63 , 64 , 98 , 117 , and 123 have well populated seds rising in the ir and are thus good candidates for agns .",
    "indeed , seven of them ( # 11 , 38 , 45 , 64 , 98 , 117 , and 123 ) have been identified to be quasars by @xcite and one ( # 24 ) is a resolved galaxy with a prominent nucleus @xcite . since stellar emission is not expected to be flat and since many of these objects are detected only in the ir ( not in optical ) , we suggest that objects with flat seds may also be agns . in table",
    "[ addcount ] , we use `` agn '' to denote confirmed objects and `` ( agn ) '' for candidates .    finally , our observation did not reveal active hmxbs amongst known massive stars in n11 ( see sect .  4 ) and",
    "the late b - stars newly identified with the photometry ( see previous paragraphs ) display no definitive sign of being in hmxbs .",
    "we have further examined the data to see whether other bright x - ray sources would have ( unknown ) ob counterparts , following the method of @xcite and using the information available on the nature of the sources , when existing . as in 30",
    "dor @xcite and some other lmc clusters @xcite , no hmxb was detected in n11 , although its cluster lh9 is old enough ( @xmath67myr , @xcite ) for its initially most massive stars to have undergone supernovae . adopting the classical salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for the observed stellar content and with upper cut - off at @xmath68 , up to 10 stars initially more massive than @xmath69",

    "however , correlating the list of x - ray sources ( see table[sourcelist ] ) with the list of ob stars with known spectroscopic classification led to 13 positive matches . as a last check , we further inspected the x - ray image by eye and one additional x - ray source associated with an o - type star was clearly spotted ( see e.g. the many countours showing a source associated with pgmw3100 in fig .",
    "[ lh10hst ] ) .",
    "an extraction run specific to ob stars ( see below ) yields a 2@xmath13 detection for this object and a false detection probability just below that of the detected objects ( i.e. much higher than for the truly undetected o - stars ) .",
    "it lies near a rather bright point source and on the edge of diffuse emission , which probably explains its non - detection by the automated detection algorithms .",
    "table[deto ] lists the properties of these 14 ob stars with detected x - ray emission .",
    "the first five columns report the x - ray source number , the elst or pgmw identification , the spectral type and binary status ( from elst , @xcite , or pgmw ) .",
    "in addition , we derived for each object the color excesses @xmath72 from the @xmath73 photometry , using the intrinsic colors from @xcite .",
    "galactic reddening towards the lmc was estimated to be 00.15 mag by @xcite ; as the reddening of some of our stars is @xmath74 , we will consider the galactic contribution negligible and we therefore calculate the absorbing columns @xmath75 using a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath76h - atom@xmath7mag@xmath1 , typical of the lmc @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosities , when not estimated by @xcite , were also derived from the @xmath73 photometry with intrinsic colors and bolometric corrections from @xcite ; they were derived using the properties of the earliest component if the object is a binary with types of the two components known ( ` sb2 ' in table[deto ] ) .",
    "these derived absorbing columns and bolometric luminosities are presented in the sixth and seventh columns of table[deto ] .",
    "the last two columns of that table give the unabsorbed flux ( in the 0.510kev band ) and  ratio ( see also fig .",
    "[ lxlbol ] ) .",
    "these x - ray luminosities were derived by different methods depending on the source brightness .",
    "five of the sources have enough counts ( @xmath7780 cts ) for a rough spectral analysis .",
    "they were modeled within xspec using an absorbed thermal model ( xspec models mekal and vphabs , both with metal abundances set to 0.3 times solar ) . results of these fits are shown in table[speco ] . as is usual for massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two solutions of rather similar quality can be found , one with high t and low @xmath78 , the other with low t and high @xmath78 .",
    "it is difficult to choose between the two solutions since the exact amount of additional absorption @xmath78 , due to the cool wind , beyond the interstellar absorption can not be a priori fixed : the formal best - fit one is listed in table[speco ] .",
    "however , it must be stressed that this dual solution ambiguity affects only the derivation of intrinsic emission levels , but has no impact on the derivation of  ratios , as the x - ray luminosities used in this context are corrected by the _",
    "interstellar _ absorption only . for the fainter sources",
    ", we derived fluxes by converting the count rates . using the on - axis response matrices and a thermal model with a temperature @xmath79=0.6kev absorbed by the @xmath75 determined above ( both with metal abundances set to 0.3 times solar ) , we derived conversion factors between count rates ( in cts  ks@xmath1 ) and unabsorbed fluxes ( in erg@xmath7s@xmath1 ) of 0.52@xmath80 .",
    "using a temperature of 0.3kev would increase the fluxes by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "only one of the detected sources is a b - type star , the detection fraction for these objects is thus low , @xmath51.3% ( 1 out of 80 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since b - type stars are generally not bright x - ray emitters and the x - ray emission apparently associated with such objects has generally been attributed to a flaring pms companion ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or to an accreting compact companion . generally , the b stars with detected x - ray emission have early types ( b0-b0.5 ) and their emission is due to embedded wind - shocks as in o - type stars .",
    "this could apply to src # 110 ( elst33 ) , an early - type b star whose count rate is correspondingly low with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath81 and whose  is similar to that of o - stars in our sample .",
    "most of the detected sources correspond to hot , o - type objects .",
    "two of them correspond to the compact ob groups hd32228 and pgmw3204/9 , while another one is associated with the compact region n11a and its small cluster ( see individual discussion for these below ) . excluding the 19 stars in these compact groups , the fraction of detected o - type stars is 16% ( 10 out of 62 ) .",
    "when ranked by magnitude or spectral types , it appears that the hottest and/or earliest objects are preferentially detected , as could be expected ( the detection fraction is 57% for o25 stars , 25% for o5.5o7 stars and",
    "3% for o7.59.7 stars ) .",
    "however , when one looks into details , things are not so simple . for example , of the four o23 stars present in the field , only two are detected : the one belonging to the pgmw3204/9 compound ( which thus contains additional massive stars emitting x - rays ) and elst31 .",
    "the latter object is neither a known binary nor the brightest earliest - type star ( elst26 being slightly brighter than elst31 ) .",
    "to gain further insight into the global properties of the ob star population , we estimated the total - band count rates of all ob sources in the field using their catalogued positions and corresponding 90% eer ( i.e. not 70% eer as before ) to minimize the potential effect of the astrometry errors in the x - ray data and the objects positions .",
    "results for the 13 detected o - stars are of course consistent with the count rates reported in table [ sourcelist ] . on the other hand , for the 52 undetected o - stars , these measurements allowed us to derive upper limits , which we adopted to be the 3@xmath13 errors on the count rates .",
    "these upper limits on the count rates were transformed into upper limits on the unabsorbed flux as was done above for the fainter detected sources .",
    "table[allo ] summarizes the properties of these 52 undetected o - type stars present in the  fov .",
    "columns one and two give the star numbers in elst and pgmw , respectively ; the third and fourth columns indicate the spectral type and binary status ; the fifth column provides the bolometric luminosity as given by @xcite when available or as derived from the @xmath73 photometry otherwise ; the sixth column lists the absorbing columns , derived from the photometric color excess as explained earlier ; the last columns yield the upper limits on the x - ray luminosity and on the  ratio ( see also fig.[lxlbol ] ) .",
    "in addition to these limits , we also derived the combined properties of these 52 undetected o - stars .",
    "summing their count rates and combining the associated errors yields a stacked value of @xmath82ctsks@xmath1 , corresponding to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath83ergs@xmath1 and a  of @xmath84 .",
    "this value is expectedly lower than all individual lower limits on .",
    "it also implies that several undetected massive stars ( since the stacked signal appears dominated by @xmath8510 objects ) emit with levels not much below our sensitivity limit , but only more sensitive observations with a high spatial resolution will be able to clearly detect them above the bright diffuse background .",
    "having all that information at hand , we may now compare n11 with the galaxy . in our galaxy , massive o - stars display soft spectra ( @xmath79 of 0.20.6kev ) and follow @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this relation reflects an intimate link of x - rays and the stellar winds , as x - rays are produced behind shocks in these unstable outflows , though a full understanding of the origin of the relation is still lacking ( steps in this direction have been made by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "different  values have been reported in the literature for galactic objects , but these differences are probably explained by choices made in the analysis ( e.g. , method for deriving @xmath87 ) and the data quality @xcite . since the x - ray emission depends on the winds , it may be expected that massive stars with different wind properties , such as low - metallicity , will show a different level of x - ray emission .",
    "in addition , deviations from that ` canonical ' @xmath88 relation are also found in exceptional cases .",
    "for example , while most massive o+ob binaries are not much harder or brighter ( small overluminosities of 0.2dex at most , @xcite ) than single stars , a few systems appear hard and overluminous because an x - ray - bright wind - wind collision is present ( e.g. , hd93403 , @xcite ; cygob2#9 , @xcite ) .",
    "magnetically confined winds may also lead to overluminosities in strongly magnetic stars ( e.g. , @xmath89oric , @xcite ) .    in n11",
    ", results from spectral fits suggest rather large  ratios and high plasma temperatures .",
    "indeed , except for the hd32228 compound , all detected sources clearly lie above the galactic @xmath90 relation ( fig.[lxlbol ] ) and temperatures of 0.71.3kev are recorded here , when temperatures of 0.2 or 0.6kev ( depending of the trade - off between temperature and absorption mentioned above ) are usually observed for galactic o - stars . while it is possible that the stellar census is limited by confusion ( with several neighbouring stars mistaken as one , leading to errors in the bolometric luminosity estimates ) , it is also very probable that we detect only the x - ray - bright tip of the massive star population .",
    "the detected objects would then be wind - wind interacting systems or strongly magnetic objects ; they would therefore not be fully representative of the properties of the o - type population in n11 . in this context",
    ", it may be worth noting that , excluding the stars in compact groups , only 20% ( 2 out of 10 ) of the x - ray sources are known binaries , i.e. , a smaller fraction than in the n11 population ( 36% , elst ) - though the limited monitoring of elst may have missed the multiplicity of some objects .",
    "further study should be undertaken to clarify the status of the detected objects ( bona - fide single stars , colliding - wind binaries , magnetic objects ) . to get a more representative idea of the actual x - ray emission level from massive stars in the lmc",
    ", we may turn to the undetected o - stars : their stacked emission suggests a lower  value of @xmath91 . this is a value comparable to galactic values ( e.g. , carina nebula , @xcite ) , which contradicts a priori intuitions ( lower metallicity@xmath92weaker winds@xmath92fainter x - ray emission ) .",
    "future observations are however needed to confirm the overall representativity of this  value for massive stars , and to enlarge the study of the  ratio in the lmc .",
    "the main component of lh9 , the compact group also known as hd32228 , is clearly detected in our observations ( fig .",
    "[ lh9 ha ] ) .",
    "its x - ray emission follows the visible one , i.e. , it is not a simple point source and looks rather extended .",
    "the morphology is actually reminiscent of a point - like source superimposed on a small region of diffuse emission , itself immersed in the fainter superbubble emission from the whole cluster .",
    "we have extracted spectra of each of these 3 regions ( see tables [ speco ] and [ specdif ] ) .",
    "the emission peaks at the position of the stellar group encompassing the wolf - rayet brey 9 or bat99 - 10 .",
    "since this evolved object belongs to the carbon sequence , it is not expected to emit significant amounts of x - rays if single @xcite . the total luminosity from all o - type stars in the hd32228",
    "compound amounts to @xmath93ergs@xmath1 , implying a  ratio of @xmath94 , fully compatible with the galactic value ( table [ deto ] ) .",
    "the surrounding area ( ` near hd32228 ' , see table[specdif ] ) , once cleaned of the superbubble ` background ' contribution , presents a harder spectrum than the emission associated with the superbubble itself .",
    "its high temperature and high absorption suggests the emission to be dominated by the overall x - rays from unresolved stellar objects , most probably o and pms stars .",
    "in contrast , another region in lh9 with higher surface brightness ( ` inside lh9 ' , see table[specdif ] ) displays a spectrum very similar to the superbubble itself - only a few deviant high - energy bins , maybe spurious , are detected as a very high temperature plasma with low emission measure . to the limits of our data , the x - ray emission associated with the superbubble around lh9 thus appears rather uniform if one excludes hd32228 and its surroundings .",
    "[ lh10hst ] shows a close - up on the lh10 cluster . in this region ,",
    "six point - like sources are detected .",
    "they correspond to five o - type stars ( elst 31 , 38 , and 50 , pgmw 3070 and 3120 ) and one compact group ( pgmw3204/9 ) .",
    "the brightest source , pgmw3070 , appears actually as a tight cluster in the _ hst _ images .",
    "the point - like source associated with the two subclusters display a slightly elongated shape , probably indicating that they are not truly point - like sources .",
    "their flux is also too high for a single star , with  of @xmath95 for the sole pgmw3070 .",
    "the fluxes of the other sources in lh10 are also higher than observed in galactic single o - type stars .",
    "this is especially the case of the bright binary elst50 , which presents the highest   ratio : even taking into account the presence of two stars , the x - ray source is still about 5 times brighter than expected .",
    "the ratio appears closer to the galactic value only for pgmw3204/9 , considering the sum of the individual luminosities of this stellar group s components  detailed stellar content is well known in this area , but maybe not elsewhere in lh10 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in our data , pgmw3204/9 appears as bright as pgmw3070 , whereas it was half as bright during the _ xmm _ observations ( compare our fig.[lh10hst ] with fig .",
    "11 of @xcite ) : this may indicate some variability in its high - energy emission , which is not expected for single , ` normal ' massive stars and is therefore generally associated with an orbital or rotational modulation .",
    "further monitoring of these objects is needed to ascertain their nature .",
    "some diffuse emission is also present throughout the field , especially to the southwest of the cluster , near pgmw 3070 and 3120 . in this region ,",
    "a wind - blown bubble was detected by @xcite .",
    "however , the same authors found another expanding bubble east of pgmw 3204/9 and elst 50 , with similar expansion velocity but it does not appear to be associated with diffuse emission as bright as the former .",
    "higher velocity structures were also detected by @xcite , but appear to the south and west of the x - ray bright region , not coincident with it . it might be noted that the diffuse emission , which appears centrally peaked rather than bright - rimmed , corresponds to the region of highest stellar density - the eastern part of lh10 being much less crowded .",
    "this could suggest that at least part of the x - ray emission actually comes from unresolved stars , as in the case of ngc602 in the smc @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis seems confirmed when the spectrum of that diffuse emission is analyzed ( table[specdif ] ) : two thermal components are present , one with a low temperature typical of soft diffuse emission and one with higher temperature , most probably stellar in origin ( both components have similar luminosities in the 0.32.0kev band ) .",
    "the compact hii region n11a , lying to the east of lh10 , probably harbors the youngest optically - visible stars in the field @xcite .",
    "it is associated with the ` star ' pgmw3264 or elst28 , which is actually the earliest component of a compact stellar group composed of 7 objects .",
    "the associated x - ray emission is rather strong and a comparison of its shape with that of its neighbours suggests some extension . since the earliest object was proposed to be a highly obscured mid o - type star @xcite , so that strong x - ray emission from that star is not expected .",
    "the x - ray emission may rather be associated with wind - wind interactions between the cluster members or a combination of several unresolved sources .",
    "unfortunately , the spectrum of this source is difficult to extract since it lies on the edge of some datasets .",
    "the crude x - ray spectrum only points to a high temperature , but the high noise prevents us to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "these results should therefore be taken with caution ( especially since a low absorbing column is also favored by the noisy data , clearly at odds with the heavy extinction expected within a dense cloud ) .",
    "n11a deserves further investigation especially to assess its stellar content in detail .      as can be seen in the color image of the  fov ( fig.[fig : rgb ] )",
    ", soft diffuse emission pervades the n11 region . on the basis of the surface brightness",
    ", we defined 11 regions to be further analyzed and three regions displaying lower emission were chosen as backgrounds ( see fig.[difpos ] and table[regiondif ] for their positions ) .    for their study , we need to estimate the non - x - ray background contribution which is not vignetted by the telescope .",
    "this estimate uses the acis stowed background database , which has been processed with charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and gain corrections . the background level in each chip of individual observations",
    "was further normalized according to the ratio of its count rate to that of the stowed data in the 1012kev band , where events are almost completely due to the non - x - ray background .",
    "spectra of the chosen regions were extracted , the non - x - ray background being subtracted from each one .",
    "regions of twice the 70% eer around each point source were removed .",
    "note that for visual presentation of smoothed diffuse x - ray intensity maps , we replace the source - removed region with values interpolated from data in surrounding bins ( see e.g. fig.[difpos ] ) .",
    "the spectra have been analyzed in the 0.32kev range ; beyond which there is little signal .    to take into account the variations of the sensitivity across the fov , the spectral",
    "fitting was done in two steps .",
    "first , each background ( or combination of background ) was individually fitted although the background spectral shape remains rather similar , with the most varying parameter being the overall intensity level .",
    "second , the sources were fitted by models of the form @xmath96 , where the former component represents the true spectrum of the diffuse source ( metal abundances of the absorption and thermal emission models were accordingly fixed to 0.3 ) and the latter represents the best - fit background model determined before ( these were fixed to the best - fit background model with the normalisation factors scaled by the effective surface ratio - keyword bacscal - of the source and background regions ) .",
    "the results of these fits are presented in table[specdif ] .",
    "the spectral analysis of two additional regions of lh9 that display a higher surface brightness is also presented in this table .",
    "the results from spectral fitting allow us to compare the selected regions .",
    "first , we examine temperature variations .",
    "the spectra of all regions display a thermal component at low temperature ( @xmath970.2kev ) . for lh9 and lh10 , an additional , hotter plasma component ( @xmath98kev )",
    "was needed to obtain a good fit , suggesting it to be associated with unresolved stellar objects ( pms , o stars ) .",
    "this contamination is not negligible since it represents about one - third of the total flux associated with the diffuse sources .",
    "its stellar origin is supported by the analysis of the region ( called ` middle ' ) situated between lh9lh10 and the northern limit of the fov .",
    "the spectrum of the latter region does not require the presence of a high temperature component : indeed , only a few stars are scattered across this region and the stellar contribution is thus expected to be negligible here .",
    "note that a fit of the lh9 spectrum where the abundance of the low - temperature component is allowed to vary does not improve the @xmath34 .    regarding absorptions ,",
    "a value of @xmath99h - atom@xmath7 is generally found for the 1 t fits , and a lower value for the 2 t fits .",
    "the larger absorption value might in fact be an artifact : if we use only one component to fit the spectra of lh9 or lh10 , the best - fit also yields a higher absorption for these objects - this may also be linked to the temperature - absorption trade - off mentioned before .",
    "unfortunately , the spectra of the other diffuse sources are too noisy for making a meaningful 2@xmath100 fit . keeping this caveat in mind",
    ", one can however see the remarkable homogeneity of the derived spectral parameters , with the exception of harder components being needed when stellar clusters are located ( lh9 , lh10 ) .",
    "this paper reports the first results of a very deep   observation of the giant hii region n11 in the lmc .",
    "soft diffusion emission is seen throughout the field , but its spectra reveal some point source contamination .",
    "thanks to the long exposure ( @xmath5300ks ) and the high spatial resolution , 165 x - ray point - sources were detected in the field , with three showing significant temporal variability .",
    "our  observation thus increases by more than a factor of five the number of point - sources known in n11 . keeping in mind that the sensitivity varies across the field",
    ", it must be noted that the faintest detected sources have count rates of about 0.04 ctsks@xmath1 , which correspond to luminosities of about 10@xmath0ergs@xmath1 in the 0.58.0kev energy band .",
    "diffuse emission is also detected throughout the field , but the harder x - ray emission from some regions indicates contamination from unresolved stars .",
    "most of the x - ray sources are background objects seen through the lmc , but there are also 11 galactic stars .",
    "however , 14 ob stars are clearly detected in x - rays , three of them corresponding to compact clusters ( hd32228 , pgmw3204/9 , and n11a ) .",
    "the known binaries are not preferentially detected in n11 , though this conclusion might be biased by the incomplete knowledge of the stellar multiplicity .",
    "indeed , these stars could correspond to interacting winds systems or magnetic objects , as may be suggested by their rather high luminosities and plasma temperatures . in this context , it should be noted that changes are detected in massive stars of lh10 , compared to older _ xmm _ data .",
