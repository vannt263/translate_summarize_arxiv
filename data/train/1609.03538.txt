    "silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistors ( si - mosfets ) have been in the focus of an extensive research effort throughout the ongoing studies of the properties of low - dimensional electron systems .",
    "fifty years ago , electrons in the si - mosfet inversion layers@xcite were among the first experimental realisations of 2-dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( 2deg ) @xcite .",
    "some thirty years later , they yielded the first example of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in a 2d system@xcite . while the full understanding of this phenomenon is yet to be achieved ,",
    "a remarkable progress towards this goal has been made both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "in particular , attention was paid to the close interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom , as exemplified by strong positive magnetoresistance in a parallel magnetic field ( when orbital effects are negligible)@xcite .",
    "this allows , for example , to use an electric current for manipulating the spin density in restricted geometries@xcite , which appears relevant in the general context of spintronics .    as opposed to the magnetotransport , measuring the magnetic properties of the 2deg presents formidable experimental difficulties@xcite . in the case of si - mosfets ,",
    "such measurements are necessarily indirect , and both accuracy and interpretation of the results can and should be questioned .",
    "nevertheless , it was established that the low - field magnetic susceptibility in the metallic state increases when the carrier density ( controlled by a voltage applied to the metallic gate ) is decreased towards the mit .",
    "it is not yet reliably verified whether this increase is finite@xcite , or a ferromagnetic transition takes place in the vicinity of the mit@xcite ; in addition , evidence of magnetic inhomogeneities has been reported recently for low densities@xcite .",
    "an important theoretical study suggests a divergence of the electron effective mass and hence of the susceptibility at the mit without an associated magnetic transition@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the possibility of ferromagnetism in a 2deg is a fascinating subject in itself , originally suggested on the basis of numerical investigations@xcite . while this suggestion finds further support in some subsequent numerical work @xcite , others@xcite do not find any critical behaviour of susceptibility in a low density two - valley 2deg ( the latter , as appropriate for a si-\\{100 } mosfet ) .",
    "it was also noted that in reality , the inversion layer has a finite thickness ( which increases for smaller carrier densities ) , resulting in a quasi-2deg ( as opposed to a strictly 2d case ) .",
    "this was taken into account by including the appropriate formfactors@xcite into diagrammatic summations@xcite and monte - carlo numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "orbital effects of the in - plane magnetic field were invoked as well @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetic properties of 2deg in si - mosfets attract considerable attention from both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "it is therefore somewhat surprising that a systematic stoner - type mean field treatment has not been carried out for this case .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that in a 2deg at low densities ( in the vicinity of the mit ) , the dominant role is played by the long - range coulomb correlations , whereas the stoner approach emphasises the _ local _ mean field , arising from the short - range ( or on - site ) repulsion .    in agreement with ref .",
    ", a comprehensive recent review@xcite of experimental data finds a pronounced renormalisation of quasiparticle band on approaching the mit from the high - density metallic phase .",
    "phenomenologically , the data correspond to a non - interacting 2deg with a bandwidth diverging at the mit .",
    "we argue that the effects of the short - range interaction likely become important in this case , drastically modifying the magnetic properties of the system and leading to a ferromagnetic transition .",
    "this surely holds also in the opposite case of high carrier density ( deep inside the metallic phase ) : there , the on - site repulsion provides the dominant contribution to magnetic susceptibility , which increases with density .",
    "due to the restricted geometry of electron motion in mosfets ( finite layer thickness ) , the mean field theory takes on a somewhat unusual form as opposed to purely 2d or 3d cases .",
    "in addition to zeeman - like energy shifts under a combined effect of interaction and external field , one must take into account changes in the carrier wave functions .",
    "this effect , which was not included in previous treatments , leads to a further increase in susceptibility .",
    "this opens an intriguing possibility of a ferromagnetic transition in the region where the interaction is still not too strong , and hence the mean field approach is qualitatively valid .",
    "the latter should be contrasted with the well - known failure of mean field theory for the two - dimensional hubbard model , where even in the case of infinite on - site repulsion ferromagnetism may arise only in a restricted range of values of the carrier density@xcite ( although the ferromagnetic region of the phase diagram is broadened once the allowance is made for further - neighbour hopping@xcite and for partial spin - polarisation in the ferromagnetic state@xcite ) . on the other hand , we note recent results@xcite on 2d atomic gases with short - range repulsion , suggesting that mean field theory may be _ overestimating _ the interaction strength required for ferromagnetism .    for the purposes of the present study , it is obviously important to adequately estimate the strength of short - range interaction . while a recent study@xcite suggests that the on - site repulsion is of order @xmath0 ev , this is likely to be an over - estimate , especially since the wannier function in silicon can be expected to spread over several lattice sites .",
    "on the other hand , we wish to write the short - range interaction @xmath1 for our continuum description in the form of a contact repulsion ( or equivalently an @xmath2-wave scattering ) , @xmath3 interaction constant @xmath4 includes contributions from those neighbouring sites @xmath5 on the underlying discrete lattice where the wavefunction overlap with a given site @xmath6 ( or equivalently , the off - site repulsion @xmath7 ) is non - negligible@xcite : @xmath8 with @xmath9   the lattice period .",
    "taking the simple cubic lattice as an example , we see that the combined effect of a rather more realistic @xmath10 ev , the nearest neighbour @xmath11 ev and next - nearest neighbour repulsion of @xmath12 ev is the same as that of a @xmath13 ev acting alone . given the apparent absence of reliable _ ab initio _",
    "data for @xmath7 , we will be using the latter estimate henceforth .",

    "[ sec : mf ] . in the following section , we analyse the mean field solution in the low- to moderate density range , where only one transverse level is occupied , discussing the emergent behaviour and also comparing it to a simple variational result . as explained above , when approaching the mit one has to take into account the bandwidth renormalisation due to the long - range interactions ( sect .",

    ", a proper description implies filling multiple transverse levels , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : metal ] .",
    "we note that our results suggest a possibility of ferromagnetism in both cases .",
    "the field dependence of magnetisation in the paramagnetic phase is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : field ] , and the concluding discussion is relegated to sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "our analysis relies on a conjecture that the stoner approach remains relevant in a 2d system down to sufficiently low densities .",
    "arguments to this effect are given in the appendix .",
    "preliminary results were reported in ref . .",
    "here , we generalize the familiar mean - field description@xcite of an @xmath14-doped si inversion layer , taking into account the short - range electron - electron repulsion and allowing for the presence of an applied magnetic field .    in a si - mosfet , a quasi-2d conducting layer is formed on the surface of bulk silicon , and the spectral properties of the carriers depend on the crystallographic orientation of this surface .",
    "while this is not expected to affect our results at the qualitative level , we consider the case of a @xmath15 surface . when a sufficiently large positive voltage @xmath16 is applied to the metallic gate ( which is separated from si by an oxide layer ,",

    "conduction band valleys dip below the fermi level .",
    "the latter is fixed at the top of the valence band of the bulk si , which we will use as a zero of energy , @xmath17 . an adequate description of electrostatics can not be achieved without taking into account the impurities present in the bulk .",
    "again , it is expected that the details are unimportant and we assume the presence of a single acceptor level at @xmath18 ( more precisely , at a negligible positive @xmath19 ) , with the volume density of acceptors @xmath20 . when a small positive voltage @xmath16 is applied to the gate",
    ", a _ depletion layer _ of variable width @xmath21 is formed near the surface . within this layer ( at @xmath22 , assuming @xmath23 at the surface ) , the acceptor states are occupied by electrons , whereas the bottom of the conduction band decreases linearly from its bulk value @xmath24 to a ( variable ) value @xmath25 achieved at @xmath23 ( triangular potential ; note that we consider the case of zero temperature ) .",
    "equivalently , the electrostatic potential @xmath26 increases linearly from its constant value ( which we choose as @xmath27 ) within the bulk ( _ i.e. , _ everywhere at @xmath28 ) .",

    "a spin - up electron at a level @xmath73 interacts with a spin - down electron with a level number @xmath74 via a 2d contact repulsion , @xmath75    note that while a similar integral with the same value of spin projections for both wave functions does not vanish , the same - spin electrons with different level indices do not interact .",

    "in addition to including the effects of @xmath4 and @xmath61 , an important difference from the previous calculations ( including ref . )",

    "[ sec : metal ] and [ sec : field ] .",

    "this is unphysical as in reality this variation of @xmath14 is for the most part suppressed by the large capacitance @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phigate ] ) .",
    "we find that the relative change in @xmath14 is in fact rather small ( see below , sec .",
    "[ sec : field ] ) .",
    "thus , the appropriate mean - field thermodynamic potential , which is minimised by the suitable mean - field solution , corresponds to fixing @xmath16 , rather than @xmath14 : @xmath103 the three terms in the first line are the energies of @xmath57-axis and in - plane motion of the q2deg carriers , and the correction to exclude the double - counting of their electrostatic energy .",
    "double - counting of the interaction energy is corrected by the first term in the second line , whereas the second term is the electrostatic energy of immobile electrons in the depletion layer .",
    "the last term , @xmath104 , corresponds to our choosing @xmath16 as an external variable .",
    "a discussion of the applicability of our mean field scheme as outlined above is relegated to the appendix .",
    "we will now turn to the results obtained in different regimes .",
    "if the value of the gate voltage @xmath16 is not too large , only the lowest quantum level @xmath105 of the @xmath57-axis motion for each spin direction can lie below the chemical potential and be populated by the q2deg carriers : @xmath106 this situation , which is termed electrical quantum limit , is somewhat simpler to analyse than the full multi - level case , and we will consider it first in order to illustrate certain key features of our mean - field results and underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "moreover , we find it expedient to formally allow for values of @xmath16 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath14 ) to increase beyond the range where the electrical quantum limit is realised ( the latter corresponds to lower carrier densities , @xmath107 @xmath108 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : metal ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by using eq .",

    "since within the present section the ladder and level indices of all quantities are always equal to zero , we will suppress these .",
    "let us first briefly recall the usual stoner picture , applicable both in the three - dimensional bulk and in the case of a perfectly 2d carriers ( no @xmath57-axis degree of freedom ) , interacting via contact potential , @xmath110 . at the mean - field level , the effect of interaction is additive with that of the applied field @xmath61 , increasing the energy shifts of the two spin subbands ( zeeman splitting ) .",
    "the wave functions ( which in the 2d case are given by products of @xmath111 and the in - plane bloch wave ) are unaffected , and one readily finds the magnetic susceptibility , which in the 2d case is given by @xmath112 as long as both the 2d density of states @xmath113 and @xmath114 remain constant , @xmath115 does not depend on density . if either of these can be varied to the extent that the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dstoner ] ) vanishes , the ensuing divergence of @xmath115 suggests a ferromagnetic transition . owing to the independence of @xmath113 on the carrier energy in the 2d case , this critical point has a peculiar character , that of a discontinuous transition with no hysteresis .",
    "specifically , everywhere in the ferromagnetic phase the mean - field free energy minimum is attained in the fully spin - polarised state , whereas at the transition point itself the free energy does not depend on the magnetisation .",
    "thus the magnetisation shows a jump at the transition point , simultaneous with vanishing of both the spin stiffness ( from the ferromagnetic side ) and inverse susceptibility .",
    "these properties are strongly modified in the case of the q2deg as found in a si inversion layer .",
    "first , note that the interaction strength @xmath114 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2d ] ) and depends on the density @xmath14 .",

    "this is due to the increase of the ratio @xmath124 ( @xmath21 only weakly depends on @xmath14 ) , which leads to a progressively larger part of the electrostatic field of the gate being screened by the mobile carriers _ within _ the layer of the q2deg ( and not elsewhere within the depletion layer ) . hence the potential @xmath26 becomes steeper at small @xmath57 , resulting in smaller @xmath125 and larger @xmath118 and @xmath114 .",

    "[ sec : dolgo ] ) . in this case , the long - range forces lead to a significant reduction of effective band width ( and hence of the effective fermi energy ) , to the extent that if those renormalised quantities are substituted when calculating @xmath374 , one might find that the inequality ( [ eq : invalid ] ) is actually satisfied .",
    "we wish to argue that such a substitution would be hard to justify , quoting the following reasons :    \\(i ) the renormalised quantities refer not to the electrons , but to the resultant quasiparticles . these are extended objects , which presumably should be viewed as residing on an effective lattice with proportionally increased lattice period , which should thus be used in place of @xmath366 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deinf ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) more importantly , these quasiparticles characterise low - energy , long - wavelength properties of the system , whereas contact interaction with point defects involve a significant short - wavelength component .",
    "the short - wavelength contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) originates from the logarithmic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "therefore it is more appropriate to use _ unrenormalised _ spectral parameters when estimating this term _ only _ , including the coefficient before the logarithm . elsewhere in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) one should be using the renormalised spectrum characterised by a larger mass , yet it is easy to see that within this order - of - magnitude estimate the renormalisation coefficient cancels out for large @xmath368",
    ". hence @xmath387 retains ( roughly ) its unrenormalised value and we arrive at a conclusion that the mean - field approach is still qualitatively applicable .",
