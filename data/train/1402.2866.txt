    "it is required that optical qms are connected to the optical fiber network . however , despite initial attempts to build qms operating in the telecom range @xcite , the best current qms absorb and emit photons in the visible to near infrared range , where losses in optical fibers are significant . in order to overcome this problem , a possible strategy consists in translating the frequency of the single photons emitted by the qms to the telecommunication band , in an efficient , noise free and coherent fashion .",

    "frequency down conversion using difference frequency generation ( dfg ) enables frequency translation from visible to telecom bands and is therefore ideally suited for quantum repeaters applications @xcite .",
    "dfg has been demonstrated with single photons from solid state emitters @xcite and spontaneous down conversion sources ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "however , so far qfc using solid state non linear devices has not been demonstrated with long lived optical qms based on atomic systems .",
    "a significant experimental challenge in solid state qfc is to reduce the noise generated by the strong pump beam in the crystal , which is proportional to the input photon duration , in order to operate in the quantum regime .",
    "now , atomic qms usually emit photons with durations ranging from tens of @xmath3 @xcite to hundreds of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath4 to @xmath5 orders of magnitude longer than the photons that have been converted so far from spdc @xcite or broad band solid state emitters @xcite , which typically have sub @xmath3 durations .",
    "this in turn leads to much stronger requirements in terms of noise suppression for the qfc .        in this paper",
    "we demonstrate an ultra low noise solid state photonic quantum interface capable of connecting qms based on atomic ensembles to the telecommunication network .",
    "we generate heralded single photons at @xmath0 from a cold @xmath6 atomic ensemble qm and convert them to @xmath1 using frequency down conversion in a non linear periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide . by combining high qm retrieval efficiency , high qfc efficiency and narrow band filtering , we can operate the combined systems in a regime where a significant amount of non classical correlations is preserved between the heralding and converted photons .",

    "[ figure2]b ) , we also observe an increase of non classical correlations when decreasing the excitation probability , but the maximum is now reached for much higher values of @xmath23 because of the background noise induced by the converter pump laser .",

    "the good agreement between experimental data and expected values suggests that the noise generated from the pump is the only factor degrading the correlations and that further reduction of this noise should lead to even higher non classical correlations .",

    "[ fig : s3 ] ) .",
    "further improvement in the device efficiency could be primarily obtained by technical improvements such as decreasing the passive optical losses due to waveguide coupling and transmission , fiber coupling and filtering transmission .",
    "our quantum photonic interface could be directly useful for some efficient quantum repeater architectures using dlcz type qms , where entanglement between remote quantum nodes is achieved by entanglement swapping involving the anti - stokes photons @xcite . in that case , the anti - stokes photons are sent over long distances and must thus be converted to telecom wavelengths . for protocols where entanglement between remote atomic ensembles is achieved by detection of the stokes photon , such as the original dlcz protocol @xcite , or in order to achieve entanglement between a telecom photon and a stored spin excitation , the stokes photon should then be converted .",
    "this would however require a significant increase of the @xmath36 compared to our present experiment , since the stokes emission probability has to be low to allow highly non classical correlations .",
    "this reduction may be achieved by using narrower filtering since the current value of @xmath33 is about two order of magnitude larger than the photon bandwidth .",
    "obtaining higher @xmath36 would be also interesting in view of using this interface in combination with single atom qms emitting photons with duration of a few hundred @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated quantum frequency conversion to telecommunication wavelength of single photons emitted by a quantum memory , using a solid state integrated photonic quantum interface .",
    "these results open the road to the use of integrated optics as a practical and flexible interface capable of connecting qms to the optical fiber network .",

    "as a consequence , the @xmath36 drops to zero .",
    "when @xmath39 increases , the @xmath36 increases as well until a maximum is reached .",
    "a further increase of the pump power will result in a decrease of the @xmath36 , since the noise keeps on increasing while the device efficiency saturates .",
    "this behavior can clearly be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : s4]a . for the experiment described in the main paper we used a pump power of about @xmath168 in order to operate the device close to the point where the @xmath36 is the highest .    as it will be detailed in the next section",
    ", the @xmath36 is the key parameter to estimate the @xmath38 value achievable after conversion .",
    "it is therefore important to have a good estimate of its value . for this purpose ,",
    "we measure the @xmath36 as a function of @xmath161 for a fixed pump power . as it is shown in fig . [ fig : s4]b , the @xmath36 is linearly proportional to @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath169 . the proportionality constant @xmath170 can be regarded as the maximum achievable @xmath36 when the system is operated with a single photon input ( i.e. @xmath171 ) .",
    "a fit to the experimental data give us @xmath172 .",
    "this value is a factor @xmath173 higher than what has been reported in @xcite .",
    "this result has been achieved thanks to the improvement of the noise filtering , the increase of the device efficiency and the use of shorter photons .",
    "the second order cross - correlation function between the stokes and anti - stokes fields experiences a reduction when the frequency of the anti - stokes photons is translated to the telecom band by means of our qfcd , due to the presence of the broadband noise generated by the pump . in this section",
    "we will detail the derivation of equation 1 of the main paper , which allows us to quantify this reduction .",
    "the anti - stokes detection probability after conversion can be expressed by @xmath174 , where @xmath22 is the probability to detect an unconverted anti - stokes photon , while @xmath175 is the probability to detect a noise photon .",
    "the quantity @xmath176 accounts for the qfcd efficiency ( @xmath42 ) , the passive losses between the anti - stokes fiber output and the qfcd input ( @xmath177 ) and the difference between the efficiencies of the single photon detectors used for @xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the probability to detect an accidental coincidence between the stokes and anti - stokes fields is defined as @xmath178 and it is therefore given by @xmath179 .",
    "on the other hand , the coincidence probability @xmath41 will be given by @xmath180 .",
    "the factor @xmath181 is the same as for @xmath22 , while the quantity @xmath182 can be regarded as the probability to detect a noise photon conditioned on a previous detection of a stokes photon ( conditional noise ) . using the definition of the second order cross - correlation function",
    "we obtain : @xmath183 we define the signal to noise ratio as @xmath184 , which can be interpreted as the signal to noise ratio for the detection of an anti - stokes photon conditioned on a previous detection of a stokes photon . with this definition equation ( [ eq : g2qfc1 ] )",
    "can be cast in the following form : @xmath185 this formula presents a few remarkable aspects . in the limit of @xmath186 ( as it happens for @xmath187 ) , equation ( [ eq : g2qfc2 ] ) saturates to @xmath188 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio therefore expresses the maximum cross - correlation level achievable after conversion . on the other hand , for high stokes detection",
    "probabilities the @xmath18 function decreases .",
    "if we assume that @xmath189 , then equation ( [ eq : g2qfc2 ] ) gives @xmath190 .        as we discussed in the previous section , the @xmath36 depends linearly on the probability to have a photon at the input of the qfcd .",
    "when we convert heralded single photons from the qm , this probability is given by the retrieval efficiency @xmath191 . since @xmath191 is constant over a wide range of stokes detection probabilities ( see fig .",
    "2 of the main text ) , for a fixed pump power the @xmath36 can also be taken as constant in the same @xmath23 range .",
    "this assumption does not hold for high @xmath23 values .",
    "however , as we discussed above , in this case equation ( [ eq : g2qfc2 ] ) does not depend on the @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the @xmath36 can be assumed as constant .",
    "for a pair of independent classical fields , the second order cross - correlation function between the two modes and the relative autocorrelation functions for each mode have to satisfy the following inequality : @xmath192 which constitutes a particular case of the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xcite . a violation of the condition expressed by equation ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) indicates that non - classical correlations are present between the two modes .",
    "as we explained before , the joint quantum state for the stokes and anti - stokes field can be described by the two mode squeezed state defined in equation ( [ eq : squeezed ] ) . in the ideal case",
    ", the stokes and the anti - stokes modes individually display a thermal statistic , i.e. their second order autocorrelation is equal to @xmath24 . using equation ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) , we see that when the cross - correlation function @xmath18 exceeds the value of @xmath24 , the joint photon statistic shows a quantum behavior",
    ". however , for a generic two modes state , the autocorrelation function of each mode can exceed the value of @xmath24 .",
    "in this case , it is necessary to achieve higher @xmath18 values in order to ensure that the cauchy - schwarz inequality is violated .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to carefully measure the stokes and anti - stokes autocorrelations before assessing the quantum nature of the observed state without assumptions .    in order to measure the stokes autocorrelation function ,",
    "we use a @xmath193-@xmath193 fiber beam splitter to deliver the photons obtained from our qm to two single photon detectors .",
    "the arrival times on the two detectors are measured by means of the time stamping card mentioned above , thus obtaining a coincidence histogram .",
    "the @xmath61 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s5]a .",
    "we proceed in a similar way for the anti - stokes field .",
    "the measurements are performed for five different _ write _ powers .",
    "the results are summarized in the first three columns of table [ tab : g2auto ] , where the two autocorrelation values are listed together with the corresponding measured stokes detection probabilities .",
    "we can observe that the autocorrelation values do not change significantly for the @xmath23 range explored in the experiment .",
    "for this reason , we can combine all the histograms together and obtain a unique value for the autocorrelations , shown in the last line of the table .",
    "the measured @xmath61 is compatible with the expected thermal statistic . for the anti - stokes field",
    "the observed value is systematically below @xmath24 .",
    "this can be explained considering that for the anti - stokes photons we do not use spectral filtering to further reduce the possible leakage of _ read _ light .",
    "for this reason the signal to noise ratio is lower in this case . in the fifth column of table [",
    "tab : g2auto ] we show the value of the cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath194 calculated from the @xmath18 measured in the experiment .",
    ".values of the stokes ( @xmath61 ) , anti - stokes ( @xmath195 ) and converted anti - stokes ( @xmath62 ) autocorrelation function for various stokes detection probabilities @xmath23 .",
    "the values shown in the last row are obtained combining all the correlation histograms . in the last two columns the cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath194 ( @xmath51 )",
    "is calculated from the measured @xmath18 ( @xmath38 ) values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is possible to proceed in a similar way when the atomic based qm is used in combination with the qfcd . for the stokes field",
    ", we can use the same value as before . for the anti - stokes field ,",
    "a new measurement is necessary , performed following the same experimental strategy as above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s5]b ) .",
    "the results are shown in the forth column of table [ tab : g2auto ] , together with their average .",
    "the data have been taken using @xmath52 of pump power , measured at the waveguide output .",
    "we notice that the measured @xmath62 value is below @xmath24 .",
    "similar reasons as before contribute to explain this behavior : the converted anti - stokes photons are polluted by the broadband noise generated by the strong pump at @xmath32 while propagating in the non linear waveguide .",
    "the integration time used to accumulate the autocorrelation histogram corresponding the lowest @xmath23 value reported in table [ tab : g2auto ] is about @xmath136 hours .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath51 shown in the last column is clearly above @xmath4 , thus confirming that the quantum nature of the anti - stokes photons is preserved in the conversion process .",
