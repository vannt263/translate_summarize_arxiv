    "central extensions of lie algebras and their integrability are closely related to lie s third theorem . in fact",
    ", one can use the integration theory of central extensions of lie algebras @xcite to decide ( under some mild requirements ) whether a given lie algebra is the lie algebra of a lie group . in finite dimensions , this is always the case due to the vanishing of @xmath0 for each finite - dimensional lie group . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "@xmath0 does not always vanish and leads to lie algebras which do not integrate to lie groups @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs when integrating finite - dimensional lie algebroids to lie groupoids @xcite . in this case",
    "it is @xmath0 of leaves that restricts the integrability of a lie algebroid .",
    "the integration problem for central extensions of lie algebras may be solved from a lie theoretic perspective using locally smooth lie group cohomology , as it has been worked out in @xcite . in a similar spirit , the obstruction for integrating finite - dimensional lie algebroids to lie groupoids",
    "may be overcome by allowing a certain kind of tale lie 2-groupoids as integrating objects @xcite .",
    "this article combines these two ideas and develops the differential geometric perspective for integrating central extensions of ( infinite - dimensional ) lie algebras . as a consequence",
    ", we obtain a version of lie s third theorem asserting that each locally exponential lie algebra ( see def .",
    "[ def : loc - exp ] ) with topologically split center integrates to an tale lie 2-group .",
    "the difference to the setting from @xcite is that the lie 2-groupsthat we use in our paper are ( weak ) group objects in the category of smooth stacks , and not only 2-groups with a locally smooth group multiplication .",
    "this enhances the approach from @xcite significantly .",
    "+ we now go into some more detail . the basic idea behind the integration processes from @xcite ( and also @xcite ) is to integrate prescribed curvature 2-forms along certain triangles ( respectively homotopies between paths ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is the lie algebra of a simply connected lie group @xmath2 and that @xmath3 is a continuous lie algebra cocycle .",
    "if the _ period homomorphism _ @xmath4 ( see ) has discrete image , then @xmath5 has an integrating cocycle in the locally smooth lie group cohomology @xmath6 , i.e. , the differentiation homomorphism @xmath7 has the class of @xmath5 in its range ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.3 ) . this is shown by integrating @xmath5 along some carefully chosen triangles , an idea which dates back to van est @xcite .",
    "the procedure then reveals the obstruction against integration as a cocycle condition , which may also be viewed as an associativity constraint for enlarging a local group to a global one ( cf .",
    "so one is naturally pushed to non - associative structures when searching for a general solution of the integration problem .",
    "lie 2-groupsare such structures , which provide at the same time the next higher coherence that the problem naturally has ( cf .  the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , extensions of @xmath2 by @xmath10 $ ] live in the category of lie 2-groups and thus permit to incorporate the non - associativity that we mentioned above . in this sense",
    "our treatment is a natural extension of the validity of the procedure from @xcite .",
    "the price to pay for this freedom is that one has to work with group objects in smooth stacks ( aka lie 2-groups ) instead of group objects in smooth manifolds ( aka lie groups ) .",
    "this is technically more challenging but has similar underlying ideas",
    ". + section [ sec : cohomology ] is concerned with setting up the theory of central extensions of lie groups by abelian lie 2-groups @xmath12 $ ] , in particular to show how such extensions can be obtained from certain ech cohomology classes .",

    "it provides the conceptual background for understanding the constructions in the next section .",
    "section [ sec : geo - cocycle ] then presents the refinement of the aforementioned idea of integration along triangles .",
    "the problem that one has to overcome is that the cocycle condition that one has in @xmath13 makes many arguments implicitly work .",
    "one example for this is the smoothness of the multiplication of the central extension of lie groups associated to an integrating cocycle for @xmath5 as discussed in section [ sect : interpretation_of_the_construction_i ] .",
    "all these implications now have to be built into the choices of the triangles , and this is the key point of section [ sec : geo - cocycle ] . in a certain sense",
    ", the essence of this construction is subsumed in figures [ fig : dreieck ] and [ fig : kugel ] .",
    "section [ sec : lie - third ] then provides the differentiation process which justifies naming the construction of the previous section `` integration '' .",
    "we restrict in this treatment to tale lie 2-groups , for which the differentiation leads to ordinary lie algebras .",
