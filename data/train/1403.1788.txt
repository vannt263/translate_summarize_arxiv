    "the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism of the standard model ( sm ) predicts the higgs particle as a scalar boson .",
    "the discovery of a higgs boson with a mass near 125  gev@xcite by the experiments atlas@xcite and cms@xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is an important milestone , and it is of fundamental interest to study the properties of this state , its quantum numbers and couplings .",
    "an equally important aim is the unravelling of the overall structure of the higgs sector .",
    "while at the level of current measurements , the observed state is compatible with the higgs boson as predicted by the sm , the mass of the higgs boson is divergent at high energies@xcite . for many other open questions ,",
    "related e.g. to dark matter , naturalness and cp violation in the universe , solutions might evolve through more detailed studies of the higgs sector . from investigation of the observed boson alone one",
    "obtains relatively weak contraints on higgs decays beyond the standard model ( bsm ) ; for example , a study of the cms experiment ( figure  [ fig : br_bsm])@xcite derives an upper limit of 52% for the branching fraction into bsm decay modes at 95% confidence level .",
    "significant improvement of such limits can at least be expected to take a long time .",
    "for this reason , direct searches of bsm higgs signatures are essential to clarify the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "while the sm features a single complex higgs doublet resulting in one physical scalar higgs boson , the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) is characterized by an extended higgs sector with two complex higgs doublets .",
    "this gives rise to five physical higgs bosons , three of them neutral , labeled h , h ( cp - even ) and a ( cp - odd ) and jointly referred to as @xmath0 , and the other two charged , named h@xmath1 . at tree level ,",
    "the mssm higgs sector is governed by two parameters : the mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets . beyond tree level ,",
    "additional parameters enter via radiative corrections , and benchmark scenarios fixing these parameters are used to compare different measurements . in many cases ,",
    "the @xmath4 benchmark scenario@xcite is used .",
    "the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson is usually approximately degenerate with one of the cp - even bosons , either the h for large @xmath2 , or the h if @xmath2 is small . with the exception of the di - muon channel , this degeneracy",
    "can not be resolved within the experimental mass resolution , and thus the visible cross section effectively doubles .",
    "the coupling to the b quark is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "thus production cross sections in association with b quarks are enhanced by a factor of @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to note that the observation of a higgs boson near 125  gev with sm - like properties does not exclude additional heavy higgs bosons at large @xmath6 , as discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "if @xmath2 is large compared to the z mass , the light mssm higgs boson ( h ) becomes sm - like , a situation referred to as the decoupling limit . at the current level of measurements , both sm and mssm",
    "are found to fit the measurements about equally well , see for example ref .  .",
    "the @xmath8 channel can be seen as a good compromise between a relatively large branching fraction and manageable backgrounds .",
    "searches in this channel have been performed by the tevatron@xcite and lhc experiments ; the latter will be described in more detail .",
    "the main production mechanisms are associated production with b quarks and gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) . in correspondence , the data are sub - divided in event categories with at least one , or no b - tagged jet .",
    "the decay modes of the @xmath9 are grouped into leptonic ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and hadronic decays ( `` had '' ) .",
    "this results in six decay patterns , five of which are covered by the analyses of atlas@xcite and cms@xcite : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( only atlas ) , @xmath16 ( only cms ) .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath9 pair is reconstructed from the visible decay products and the missing transverse energy , using a likelihood technique ( cms ) and a method named missing mass calculator@xcite ( atlas ) .",

    "estimated backgrounds are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    a very important background arises from @xmath18 decays .",
    "it is addressed with an embedding technique : events with reconstructed @xmath19 decays are taken from the data , and the muon objects are replaced with simulated @xmath9 decays .",
    "additional backgrounds arise from @xmath20 decays , @xmath21 and di - boson production , qcd multijet and w+jets events .",
    "their relevance differs across the various @xmath7 decay patterns .",
    "the results shown here are based on the 7  tev data sample in the case of atlas , while the cms results include the first part of the 8  tev data .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtautau ] shows examples of the reconstructed @xmath22 spectra for selected decay patterns in the b - tag category for atlas and cms together with the estimated backgrounds .",
    "the summed background estimates describe the data very well , and there is no indication of a signal .     vs. @xmath2 obtained in the @xmath7 channel from the atlas@xcite ( left ) and cms experiments@xcite ( right ) .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ul_tautau ] in the @xmath4 scenario . at low masses ( below @xmath25  gev ) , the upper limit on @xmath3 reaches down to values of 5 , and touches the lower limit obtained by the lep experiments . at larger @xmath2 , there is still a wide range of @xmath3 allowed .",
    "inclusion of the full set of 8  tev data can be expected to give further improvements in the sensitivity of both experiments .      in the mssm ,",
    "the higgs decay into two b quarks is the dominating channel for @xmath3 significantly larger than one .",
    "furthermore , the associated higgs production with b quarks is enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 due to the modified coupling .",
    "on the other hand , there is a copious background from qcd multi - jet production , which makes this analysis very difficult and in particular challenging from the trigger aspect .         the analyses shown here search for @xmath28 signatures with at least one additional b - tagged jet .",
    "this channel was first successfully analyzed by the tevatron experiments cdf and d0@xcite .",
