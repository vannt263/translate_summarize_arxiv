    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) have emerged as the most powerful instrument for gamma - ray astronomy in the tev energy regime .",
    "iacts image the cherenkov light emitted by an air shower onto a photomultiplier ( pmt ) camera .",
    "the orientation of the image in the camera is related to the direction of the air shower , the intensity to the energy of the primary , and the shape of image can be employed to separate electromagnetic showers induced by high - energy gamma - rays from those generated by cosmic - ray nuclei interacting in the atmosphere .    the typical yield of cherenkov photons is roughly 100 photons  m@xmath7tev@xmath8 , which arrive with a time dispersion of a few ns . given this modest light yield , the light of the night - sky background , with intensities of order @xmath9 photons  m@xmath7s@xmath8sr@xmath8 , represents a significant limitation for the performance of iacts .",
    "it defines the minimum cherenkov light yield which can be reliably detected with the instrument , and hence its energy threshold .",
    "noise in the cherenkov image due to background light from the night sky results in additional uncertainties in the determination of image orientation , image intensity , and image shape .",
    "finally , the background light generates a continuous dc current in the photon detectors , which may limit their lifetime and which in the case of photomultipliers may require the operation at modest gain , in order to limit the total charge accumulated on the last dynodes and the anode during the lifetime of the experiment .",
    "variations of the night sky background light across the sky may also cause changes in the detection efficiencies , in particular once tight cuts are applied to select gamma - ray candidates , and may result in a systematic bias in on - off measurements , where the rate from a background region of the sky is used to estimate the rate of background events in the signal region ; care has to be taken to select signal and background regions with an identical sky brightness .",
    "a number of different components contribute to the night sky background light and its variation with celestial and terrestrial coordinates , here given roughly in the order of their importance :    * night airglow , which results from photochemical processes of ions in the upper atmosphere ; its intensity increases with increasing zenith angle . *",
    "the zodiacal light , which arises from the scattering of sun light by interplanetary dust near the ecliptic , and is most prominent shortly after sunset in the west , or before sunrise in the east .",
    "* starlight , which is partially resolved into discrete stars .",
    "the density of stars and star light varies by a large factor between the milky way and other regions of the sky . * diffuse galactic light , resulting from the scattering of star light by interstellar dust , in particular in the galactic plane .",
    "* extragalactic light , from unresolved galaxies and light scattered in intergalactic space represents only a very small contribution .",
    "* aurora , which is , however , negligible at low latitudes .    a detailed discussion of these various light sources is given in @xcite ; a more recent exhaustive compilation of data as well as further references can be found in @xcite . specific results for la palma  one of the sites investigated  are given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to these natural light sources , artificial light scattered in the atmosphere contributes both a continuum as well as discrete lines ( na , hg ) , see @xcite for details .    currently , a new stereoscopic iact system - the high energy stereoscopic system , or h.e.s.s .",
    "( @xcite ) - is under construction in the khomas highland of namibia .",
    "consists initially of four telescopes , with mirror areas of roughly 100 m@xmath5 each , 15  m focal length , and cameras consisting of 960 photomultiplier tubes covering a field of view of @xmath10 diameter .",
    "the four telescopes provide multiple views of the same shower from different perspectives , significantly enhancing the ability to reconstruct the orientation of the shower axis in space , to determine the shower energy and to reject cosmic - ray background showers .",
    "to assist in the layout of the camera and its trigger system and in the planning of observations , knowledge of the level of night - sky background is desirable .",
    "while the night - sky background light has been extensively investigated and documented ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is not straight - forward to use these results to estimate the background seen by the photomultipliers of a cherenkov telescope ; one reason is that typical measurements refer to the dark sky , with no detectable stars in ccd images of large astronomical telescopes .",
    "cherenkov telescopes with their relatively large image pixels will almost always integrate over a number of faint stars . also , while the visibility conditions in the gamsberg region of namibia  near the h.e.s.s .",
    "site  have been explored extensively in earlier campaigns @xcite , little information is available about the night - sky background , and in particular about the local light pollution .    therefore , an instrument was developed to reliably measure the yield of night sky photons in the wavelength range relevant for cherenkov telescopes , and measurement campaigns were conducted at la palma  the location of the hegra telescopes @xcite  and in the khomas highland of namibia .",
    "results are reported in this paper .",
    "the following sections introduce the instrument and its calibration , discuss the results obtained in the two campaigns , and conclude with the implications for the h.e.s.s",
    ". telescopes .",
    "a caveat to be mentioned is that the various components of the night - sky background light depend in differing ways on celestial and terrestrial coordinates and on time ",
    "starlight and diffuse galactic light is a function of galactic coordinates ; airglow is primarily a function of terrestrial coordinates , and shows short - term as well as seasonal and solar - cycle related time variations ; the zodiacal light depends on ecliptic coordinates ; the contribution from artificial light sources varies with terrestrial coordinates and atmospheric conditions .",
    "light is attenuated and scattered along its path through the atmosphere , influenced by local and large - scale atmospheric conditions . with only ground - based measurements at a given location and during a short time interval , one can not always identify these individual contributions ; it is non - trivial to interpret the results , and to judge to which extent they can be generalized .",
    "we believe , however , that data were taken under rather typical conditions , and would not expect the main conclusions to change as a result of a more detailed and longer - term study .",
    "in the design of an instrument to monitor the brightness of the night sky , two key choices concern the wavelength region covered , and the solid angle over which the instrument averages the photon flux .",
    "the wavelength regime relevant for the detection of cherenkov light is defined by the @xmath11 distribution of the cherenkov photons , combined with the atmospheric transmission and the quantum efficiency of the photodetectors . at short wavelengths ,",
    "atmospheric transmission introduces a cutoff at about 300  nm . at long wavelengths , beyond about 500  nm ,",
    "the quantum efficiency of conventional photocathodes deteriorates rapidly , and the contributions from longer wavelengths to the photoelectron yield are small . in order to directly match the sensitivity of the photon detectors of the h.e.s.s .",
    "cherenkov cameras @xcite , a photomultiplier with a bi - alkali photocathode was used for the night - sky measurements . in order to test and verify the wavelength dependence of the light yield , optional narrow - band filters of 360  nm ,",
    "400  nm , 450  nm and 500  nm could be introduced in the light path .    concerning the solid angle coverage ,",
    "the relevant scales are set by the field of view of the cherenkov cameras , with around @xmath12 to @xmath10 diameter , and by the field of view of the individual image elements - photomultiplier `` pixels '' with characteristic diameters in the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 ; the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes will use a @xmath15 pixel size .",
    "the relevant level of the night - sky background is given by the average photoelectron rate induced in these pixels from dark regions of the sky ; bright stars , which light up individual pixels can be handled separately . in case of the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes , stars between mag .",
    "2 and 5 , depending on the spectrum , will cause doubling of the typical pmt dc current , and will be clearly visible in the camera  . for practical reasons ,",
    "it was decided to enlarge the acceptance of the instrument somewhat compared to individual pixels , and a field of view of about @xmath16 effective diameter was chosen .",
    "[ fig_sys ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_instr ] illustrate the design of the instrument .",
    "basically , it consists of a baffled tube which defines the solid angle viewed by a photomultiplier . a remote - controlled filter wheel in front of the pmt allows to swap in the four narrow - band filters , and to cover the pmt to determine the rate of dark counts .",
    "the whole setup is mounted on a computer - controlled amateur telescope , to control the pointing ( a vixen newtonian with 800  mm focal length and f / d = 4 on a gp - dx mount interfaced via a skysensor 2000 pc to a portable computer running linux ) .",
    "the setup furthermore includes an ir radiometer , for the purpose to detect clouds resulting in a increased ir sky temperature @xcite .    as pmt",
    ", the hamamatsu hc 135 module is used , which includes a pmt with a 21  mm bi - alkali photocathode , the high voltage supply , an amplifier , discriminator , counter , timer and a control microprocessor . the unit is interfaced via a rs232 port to the portable computer .",
    "the discriminator threshold and hv are factory - preset to count signals above the `` valley '' of the single - photon response .",
    "the built - in processor automatically corrects dead - time during high - rate measurements .",
    "the unit was tested and calibrated in the laboratory .",
    "the setting of the threshold was verified .",
    "illuminating the device through a calibrated optical attenuator , the linear relation between photon flux and corrected count rate was verified at the 1% level , for count rates up to 25 mhz ; in the field , measurements rates varied between 50 hz and 5000 hz , depending on the region of the sky viewed and the filter settings .",
    "the photon counting efficiency of the unit was determined using monochromatic light , with calibrated hamamatsu and newport silicon photo diodes serving as a reference , see fig .",
    "[ fig_qe ] . in these measurements ,",
    "the photocathode was illuminated over a 10  mm diameter , similar to the diameter of the final baffle in the collimating tube .",
    "the resulting counting efficiencies are in good agreement with the calibration data at 450 , 550 and 650 nm , provided with the hamamatsu hc 135 .",
    "the laboratory measurements showed a temperature dependence of the detected rate between @xmath17 and @xmath18 per degree centigrade , consistent with specifications . in order to eliminate influence of temperature in the field measurements ,",
    "the pmt unit was surrounded by thermal insulation , and thermostat - controlled heating resistors were used to stabilize the temperature at @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "the pmt temperature was monitored during all measurements .",
    "the baffled tube defining the solid angle viewed by the pmt has an entrance baffle of 6.40  mm diameter , an exit baffle of 12.00  mm , and a number of intermediate baffles to reduce the influence of stray light .",
    "[ fig_eff ] shows the calculated transmission @xmath21 as a function of the angle @xmath22 to the axis . for the calculation a point light source in the infinite",
    "is assumed and @xmath23 is normalized to the amount of light incident through the entrance aperture . integrating the transmission curve over the solid angle , @xmath24 one finds an effective solid angle coverage @xmath25 of @xmath26 sr , using the geometrical dimensions given above and their errors .",
    "the effective solid angle was measured by first illuminating the bare pmt using an ulbricht sphere with apertures of defined size in front of the pmt and the ulbricht sphere to provide a light source of well - defined solid angle ; the counting rate was determined as a function of solid angle . by measuring the rate after adding the baffle system with the ulbricht sphere positioned to illuminate the entire field of view , the effective solid angle was then determined . from these measurements , an effective solid angle of @xmath27 sr was derived , in reasonable agreement with the geometrical estimate given above . in the following",
    ", the measured value is used ; it is equivalent to an effective diameter of the field of view of @xmath28 .",
    "the influence of stray light was studied by illuminating the baffled tube from different angles , and by pointing the device at a large illuminated area , where only the central spot  corresponding to the nominal aperture of the baffled tube  was blackened .",
    "after a number of iterations concerning the placement of baffles , the transmission of stray light at angles of a few degrees from the optical axis was reduced to about @xmath29 of the on - axis response , corresponding to a contribution of around 1% of the signal after integration over solid angle , which should be completely uncritical .",
    "the baffled tube was aligned parallel to the telescope axis to better than @xmath30 .",
    "the six - slot filter wheel ( 4 color filters , one open slot , one closed slot ) is mounted at the end of the baffled tube , just before the final baffle in front of the pmt .",
    "the transmission as a function of wavelength was measured ; the center wavelengths of the filters were determined to 360 , 399 , 448 , and 498  nm . the transmission is well described by gaussians of width 4.3 , 4.1 , 3.5 , and 4.3 nm , respectively . to relate count rate and photon flux ,",
    "the measured transmission curves were used .    in order to test the long - term stability of the instrument and its calibration ,",
    "a stable laboratory light source was employed .",
    "measurements proved reproducible within @xmath31 , even after the instrument was completely disassembled and reassembled several times .    to monitor and detect cloud layers during the measurements , an ir radiometer ( heitronics kt15.82d ) was integrated into the setup .",
    "the instrument senses ir radiation in the @xmath32 m to @xmath33 m window and converts the yield into an effective sky temperature , within the limits of @xmath34c to @xmath35c .",
    "the field of view of about @xmath36 is defined by the size of the sensor combined with a germanium lens .",
    "the use of ir radiometers in sky monitoring for cherenkov telescopes has been introduced and discussed by the durham group @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ambient temperature and the humidity were monitored during all measurements .",
    "a measurement results in a photon counting rate , usually averaged over 10  s. at count rates between 50  hz and 5000  hz , depending on the filter settings , statistical errors are small .",
    "dark counts  typically at a level of 20  hz  are subtracted , but usually represent only a minor correction .    for the measurements with a narrow - band filter with center wavelength @xmath37 , the measured rate @xmath38 can be directly converted into a photon flux @xmath39 using the measured counting efficiency @xmath40 , the filter transmission @xmath41 , and the entrance area @xmath42 and effective solid angle @xmath43 of the baffled tube , under the assumption that the spectral distribution is approximately constant over the width of the filter response . including the uncertainties in the measurements of quantum efficiencies and filter transmissions , the typical systematic errors of @xmath44 vary between 6.4% at 360  nm and 4.5% at 500  nm .",
    "the measurements without filter can be presented in two ways :    * in terms of the photoelectron rate @xmath45 per solid angle and area for bi - alkali photo cathodes , @xmath46 this rate can be directly used to calculate the rate of night - sky photoelectrons in the pmts of cherenkov telescopes , after small corrections to account for possible differences in the peak quantum efficiency , the collection efficiency and the fraction of photoelectrons cut below the trigger threshold of the hc 135 unit . * in terms of the integral photon rate over a certain wavelength interval , typically 300  nm to 650  nm , @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the counting efficiency of the pmt , averaged over the shape of the spectrum @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 the limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to be chosen such that @xmath54 is negligible outside this range .    in the second case ,",
    "the result obviously depends on the spectrum @xmath49 assumed for the night sky background when calculating @xmath48 . to determine @xmath48 , the spectrum given in @xcite was used .",
    "apart from a number of discrete lines , this spectrum is approximately flat between 300  nm to 450  nm , and rises towards longer wavelengths , see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] .",
    "the resulting average quantum efficiency is 9.8% .    including a 10% uncertainty in the shape of the assumed ( normalized ) spectrum",
    ", we find a systematic error of 8.8% for the integral flux .",
    "the rather extreme assumption of a constant spectrum @xmath55 would result in a 30% difference in the derived integral photon flux .",
    "alternative units used in the astronomical community to describe the level of the night sky background light are s10 , the equivalent number of 10th magnitude stars per square degree , or the unit ( magnitudes / arcsec@xmath5 ) .",
    "the following relations apply for the conversion @xcite : @xmath56 = 4.80 \\cdot 10 ^ 7 \\phi [ \\mbox{s10 units}]\\ ] ] in the b band ( 440 nm ) , and @xmath56 = 3.26 \\cdot 10 ^ 7 \\phi [ \\mbox{s10 units}]\\ ] ] in the v band ( 550 nm ) .",
    "one s10 unit in turn corresponds to 27.28 mag / arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the field measurements were carried out in two campaigns at la palma and in the khomas highland of namibia .",
    "the la palma site of the hegra observatory , on the site of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , is located 2200 m asl at @xmath57 w , @xmath58 n. the measurements were carried out between may 18 and may 30 , 2000 under good weather conditions , at temperatures between @xmath10 and @xmath59 , and humidities between 20% and 40% .",
    "the measurements in namibia were carried out between june 23 , 2000 and july 3 , 2000 on the site of the farm hakos , about 14 km from the future site of the h.e.s.s .",
    "installation , at 1800 m asl , @xmath60 e , @xmath61 s. the sky was clear , and temperatures and humidity were in the same range as for the la palma measurements .    before each sequence of measurements , the telescope was aligned , and the alignment calibrated using three reference stars .",
    "typical pointing precision is in the range of a few arcmin .",
    "the pointing was checked moving the instrument across a bright star , see fig .",
    "[ fig_star ] .",
    "the results confirmed both the pointing and the angular response of the instrument .    unless otherwise mentioned , all integral measurements quoted in the following refer to the wavelength range 300  nm to 650  nm .",
    "the photoelectron count rate is obtained by multiplying the flux by 0.098 .    to determine the stability of the measured night sky brightness , a set of dark regions of the sky near the zenith",
    "was measured in several nights , and the results were averaged for each night .",
    "[ fig_rate1 ] shows the photon flux determined for 8 nights of the la palma measurements , and for 8 nights of the namibia campaign .",
    "the results show a scatter of about @xmath62 between nights .",
    "since the night - to - night variation is larger than the scatter of the different measurements of a given night , this points to a systematic variation of the sky brightness .",
    "measurements of the identical location of the sky over several hours of the same night showed a 3% rms variation of the night - sky rate .",
    "the average flux in namibia is slightly below the average la palma flux .",
    "[ fig_rate2 ] compares the flux at the two locations as a function of wavelength .",
    "the data can be characterized by a @xmath63 dependence .    for comparison ,",
    "two previous measurements of @xcite and @xcite specifically conducted in the framework of cherenkov applications are summarized in table  [ table_prev ] ; the la palma measurement of @xcite is in very good agreement with the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rate1 ] ; the jammora value of @xcite is higher , but consistent within errors .",
    ".other measurements of the night - sky brightness under conditions relevant for cherenkov applications .",
    "the last column gives the photon flux scaled to the 300 - 650 nm wavelength range used in this measurement . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "using an instrument developed specially for this purpose , the level of the night sky background light was surveyed both at the la palma site of the hegra cherenkov telescope system , and near the site of the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope system in namibia .",
    "measurements were carried out over typically 10 days at each location , under good weather conditions .",
    "for identical locations of the sky , measurements show a variation of 10% between nights .",
    "the average flux of dark regions of the night sky near the zenith in la palma is @xmath4 photons / sr  s  m@xmath5 , compared to @xmath3 photons / sr  s  m@xmath5 in namibia , for a range between 300 and 650  nm .",
    "a remarkable feature of the namibia data is that the flux from dark regions of the sky is independent of the zenith angle , for zenith angles up to at least @xmath64 .",
    "since the measurements essentially represent a snapshot , as compared to an annual average , it is not a priori clear to which extent long - term or seasonal variations can account for these differences ; on the basis of visual observations over longer periods , the observation periods were characterized as representing fairly typical conditions",
    ".    integrated over the field of view of the instrument ( @xmath28 ) , the night sky background varies significantly with galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "the region near the galactic center shows fluxes which are increased by a factor 4 compared to dark regions of the sky , with consequences for the trigger thresholds of cherenkov telescopes observing in this region .",
    "the instrument was also employed to study the effect of ground albedo and reflections from the structure of a cherenkov telescope ; for cherenkov cameras where winston cones properly limit the field of view of the individual pixels , the albedo contributions to the background photoelectron rate of pixel are below 20% .",
