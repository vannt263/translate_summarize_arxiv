    "kaon condensation in dense matter was proposed over 20 years ago by kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish in this context between @xmath6 mesons and @xmath0 mesons which interact quite differently with matter .",
    "the empirical evidence from @xmath5 atoms is that the @xmath0-nuclear interaction is strongly attractive , and absorptive as well , with typical values of @xmath7  mev attraction at nuclear - matter density @xmath8 , as reviewed recently by friedman and gal @xcite .",
    "a strong nuclear attraction of somewhat less than 100 mev at @xmath8 for @xmath5 mesons , compared to a weak repulsion of order 25 mev for @xmath9 mesons , follows from observations of enhanced near - threshold production of @xmath5 mesons in proton - nucleus collisions at gsi @xcite .",
    "this weakly repulsive nature of the @xmath9-nuclear interactions was quantified a long time ago , starting with dover and moffa @xcite , and is also reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . given the distinction between the nuclear interactions of @xmath6 mesons and @xmath0 mesons , the term _ kaon condensation _ is used loosely here and elsewhere to mean @xmath0 condensation .",
    "neutron stars , with a density range extending over several times @xmath8 , offer the most natural dense systems where kaon condensation could be realized ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews of past work .",
    "we note that in _ heaven _ , for neutron stars , weak - interaction time scales of order @xmath10  s and longer are operative , enabling strangeness - changing processes such as @xmath11 to transform high - pressure dense electrons to @xmath5 mesons once the effective mass of @xmath5 mesons drops down below approximately 200 mev . under some optimal conditions , recalling that @xmath0 mesons undergo attraction of order 100 mev per density unit of @xmath8 @xcite ,",
    "kaon condensation could occur at densities about @xmath12 , depending on the way hyperons enter the constituency of neutron stars as first recognised by ellis , knorren and prakash @xcite .",
    "however , on _ earth _ under laboratory conditions , strong - interaction time scales of order @xmath13  s are operative ; processes of equilibration and hadronization subsequent to dense - matter formation in heavy - ion collisions occur over much shorter times than those controlling the composition of neutron stars .",
    "if antikaons bind strongly to nuclei , according to a scenario spelled out recently by yamazaki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , then @xmath14 mesons might provide the relevant physical degrees of freedom for self - bound strange hadronic matter that would then be realized as multi-@xmath14 nuclei .",
    "it requires that the @xmath0 separation energy @xmath15 beyond some threshold value of strangeness exceeds @xmath16  mev , where @xmath17 is the nucleon chemical potential , thus allowing for the conversion @xmath18 in matter . for this strong binding , @xmath19 and @xmath20 hyperons would no longer combine macroscopically with nucleons to compose the more conventional kaon - free form of strange hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 mesons will then condense macroscopically .",
    "however , the nuclear densities encountered in these strange hadronic nuclei are somewhat less than the typical @xmath12 threshold required to lower sufficiently the @xmath14 energy in matter to reach condensation . yet ,",
    "precursor phenomena to kaon condensation in nuclear matter could occur at lower densities as soon as @xmath15 exceeds the combination @xmath21  mev . in this case",
    ", the only mechanism underlying the widths of multi-@xmath14 states is the fairly weak conversion @xmath22 .",
    "recently we have reported on preliminary calculations of multi-@xmath14 nuclear configurations @xcite using the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) methodology , constrained by @xmath0-nucleus phenomenology .",
    "it was found that the nuclear and @xmath0 densities behave regularly on increasing the number of antikaons embedded in the nuclear medium , without any indication for abrupt or substantial increase , and that the @xmath0 separation energy saturates .",
    "roughly speaking , the heavier the nucleus is , the more antikaons it takes to saturate the separation energies , but even for @xmath23 the number required does not exceed approximately 10 . because the calculated @xmath0 separation energies @xmath1",
    "do not generally exceed 200 mev , for input binding in the accepted `` deep - binding '' range @xmath24  mev for a single @xmath0 meson @xcite , it was deemed unlikely that kaon condensation occurs in nuclear matter .",
    "this leaves antikaons in multi-@xmath25 nuclei comfortably above the range of energies appropriate to ( hyperonic ) strange hadronic matter @xcite . in the present article",
    "we discuss the full scope of these calculations demonstrating the robustness of this saturation property .",
    "in particular we study the sensitivity of the results to the nuclear equation of state used , through the nonlinear rmf version employed , and the role of `` hidden strangeness '' isoscalar meson fields beyond the standard isoscalar , scalar ( @xmath26 ) , and vector ( @xmath27 ) meson fields .",
    "although both @xmath26- and @xmath27-meson fields mediate attraction between @xmath25 mesons and nucleons , they play different roles for the interactions within @xmath25 mesons , similarly to the pattern well known for nucleons .",
    "the @xmath26 meson induces attraction , whereas the @xmath27 meson induces repulsion .",
    "if the @xmath25-meson couplings were exclusively limited to scalar - meson fields , the resulting @xmath28-meson separation energies would not have saturated . however",
    ", chiral model studies of @xmath29 low - energy phenomenology give a clear evidence in favor of the lowest - order tomozawa - weinberg _ vector _ interaction , which in terms of meson exchanges is equivalent to vector - meson exchanges with purely f - type su(3 ) pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector ( ppv ) vertices @xcite .",
    "our philosophy in this work is to use these vector - meson fields coupling constants as they are , augmenting the @xmath25-nucleus vector interaction by additional _",
    "couplings such that @xmath24  mev holds for single-@xmath25 nuclei .",
    "we find no precursor behavior to kaon condensation for @xmath0 mesons in self - bound nuclear matter .",
    "we also explore in this work exotic strange self - bound configurations where @xmath25 mesons are bound to either neutrons or protons .",
    "the simple example of a quasibound @xmath30 system ( and thus also its charge - symmetric partner @xmath31 ) recently calculated solving faddeev coupled - channel equations @xcite , clearly demonstrates that @xmath25 mesons can bind together nuclear clusters that are otherwise unbound .",
    "the point here is that the underlying @xmath32 and @xmath33 interactions ( each with equally mixed @xmath34 and @xmath35 components ) provide considerably more attraction than the purely @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 interactions .",
    "the rmf calculations reported here start with eight neutrons , showing that a finite number of neutrons can be made self bound by adding together a few @xmath4 mesons , with @xmath25 separation energies of order @xmath38  mev .",
    "we study the role of the isovector @xmath39 meson in stabilizing these exotic configurations , owing to its role in distinguishing between the underlying @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath40 interactions .",
    "we find that the emergent stable neutron configurations are more tightly bound than in the corresponding ordinary nuclei with @xmath41 along the stability valley , and the neutron single - particle spectra display substantial rearrangement .",
    "however , these exotic configurations are found to be unstable against charge - exchange @xmath42 reactions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we briefly outline the rmf methodology and discuss the @xmath25 coupling constants to the meson fields used in the present calculations .",
    "results are shown and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] for @xmath25 separation energies and density distributions , also displaying the dependence on the type of nonlinear rmf model used and the contribution of specific meson fields to the energy systematics and particularly to maintaining saturation in a robust way .",
    "a separate subsection is devoted to the study of exotic multi-@xmath25 `` nuclei '' with neutrons only .",
    "again , binding energies and densities are discussed , plus rearrangement features of the neutrons in the @xmath25-extended mean field .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "bound nuclear systems of nucleons and several @xmath14 mesons are treated in this work within the rmf framework , where the interactions among hadrons are mediated by the exchange of scalar- and vector - meson fields .",

    "we discuss @xmath5-nuclear systems .",
    "similar expressions hold for @xmath4 mesons .",
    "in addition to a scalar - meson field @xmath26 and to vector - meson fields @xmath27 and @xmath39 normally used in purely nuclear rmf calculations , we also considered meson fields that couple exclusively to strangeness degrees of freedom , a scalar @xmath48 , and a vector @xmath49 .",
    "standard techniques yield a coupled system of equations of motion for nucleons and all meson mean fields involved ; we refer the reader to our earlier work  @xcite for details . here",
    "it suffices to recall that the presence of @xmath14 meson(s ) induces additional source terms in the klein - gordon ( kg ) equations for the meson ( mean ) fields . in the case of @xmath5 mesons ,",
    "the source terms contain the @xmath5 density @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    "in the main part of this work , we studied several dynamical aspects of multi-@xmath0 nuclear states within rmf methodology .",
    "in particular , we discussed in detail the saturation pattern of @xmath14 separation energies and nuclear densities on increasing the number of antikaons embedded in the nuclear medium .",
    "saturation was demonstrated to be a robust feature of multi-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the saturated values of @xmath1 , for `` natural '' values of meson - field coupling constants were found generally to be below 200 mev , considerably short of the threshold value @xmath204 mev needed for the onset of kaon condensation under laboratory conditions .",
    "we conclude , consistently with our earlier conjecture @xcite , that @xmath14 mesons do not provide the physical `` strangeness '' degrees of freedom for self - bound strange dense matter .",

    "saturation of @xmath15 emerged for any boson - field composition that includes the dominant vector @xmath27-meson field , using the `` minimal '' su(3 ) value suggested by the leading - order tomozawa - weinberg term of the meson - baryon effective lagrangian .",
    "moreover , the contribution of each one of the vector @xmath49-meson and @xmath39-meson fields was found to be substantially repulsive for systems with a large number of antikaons , reducing the @xmath14 separation energy as well as lowering the threshold value of number of antikaons required for saturation to occur .",
    "in contrast , the coulomb interaction and the addition of a hidden - strangeness scalar @xmath48-meson field have little effect on the binding energy balance and on the pattern of saturation .",
    "we also verified that the saturation behavior of @xmath1 is qualitatively independent of the rmf model applied to the nucleonic sector .",
    "the onset of saturation was found to depend on the atomic number .",
    "generally , the heavier the nucleus is , the more antikaons it takes to saturate their separation energies .",
    "the saturation phenomenon found for the @xmath14 separation energy is also reflected in the nucleon and antikaon density distributions , with the assertions made above remaining valid .",
    "the saturation of the nuclear density in multi-@xmath14 nuclei manifests itself in the behavior of the @xmath14 effective mass distribution in the nuclear medium .",
    "we stress that in the case of antikaons the concept of nuclear matter is far from being realized even in such a heavy nucleus as @xmath205pb . specifically , the reduction of @xmath206 on adding @xmath14 mesons is pronounced only within a small region around the nuclear center .    in the second part of this work",

    "we demonstrated that a finite number of neutrons can be made self - bound by adding few @xmath4 mesons , with the resulting nuclear configurations more tightly bound than ordinary nuclei .",
