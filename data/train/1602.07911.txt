    "estimation of the current state of a dynamical system , based on the past history of a statistically dependent random process , is a central problem in the stochastic filtering theory which dates back to the works of kolmogorov and wiener of the 1940s @xcite .",
    "the performance of a state estimator is often described in terms of mean square values of the estimation errors which have to be minimized .",
    "the filtering problems arise naturally when the system state ( whose knowledge , precise or approximate , is required for feedback control ) is not accessible to direct measurement .",
    "such measurements are particularly problematic in regard to physical systems on the atomic scales , whose evolution is described in terms of operator - valued variables and obeys the laws of quantum mechanics which prohibit simultaneous projective measurements of noncommuting quantities @xcite .",
    "the incompatibility of quantum variables and the nature of measurement ( as an interaction with a macroscopic apparatus which affects the quantum system ) impose restrictions on information which can be retrieved without disturbing the system .    nevertheless , for a class of open quantum systems which are weakly coupled to external electromagnetic fields",
    ", the measurement of the output fields can be arranged in a nondemolition manner @xcite so that , at any moment of time , the past observations commute between themselves and with any future system operator . in this case , the quantum measurements are , in many respects , similar to classical observations and , in fact , can be regarded as classical random processes @xcite on a common probability space .",
    "the statistical dependence on the system variables , which results from the system - field interaction , allows such observations to be used for continuously updating the conditional density operator of the quantum system according to the stochastic master equation ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "this posterior density operator and its modifications plays the role of an information state in measurement - based quantum control problems @xcite .",
    "the sme is a quantum analogue of the kushner - stratonovich equation @xcite for the evolution of the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of the system variables in the case of classical system - observation dynamics described by stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) .",
    "similarly to its classical counterpart , the sme is a recursive implementation of the bayesian inference .",
    "accordingly , the quantum belavkin - kushner - stratonovich equation ( bkse ) @xcite , which governs the dynamics of the conditional expectations of system operators , is developed in the framework of the hudson - parthasarathy calculus of quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) @xcite .    in the qsde model of open quantum systems ,",
    "the external input bosonic fields are accommodated by ( and have their own quantum state on ) a symmetric fock space @xcite .",
    "these fields are represented by quantum wiener processes on the fock space which drive the system variables according to the energetics of the system and its interaction with the fields .",
    "the latter is specified by the system hamiltonian and the system - field coupling operators which are functions of the system variables . however",
    ", classical functions of several real or complex variables can be extended to the noncommutative quantum variables in different ways .",
    "one of such extensions is provided by the weyl functional calculus @xcite which employs unitary weyl operators whose role in this context is similar to that of the spatial harmonics in the fourier transform .",
    "the weyl quantization is used in the wigner - moyal phase - space method @xcite of quasi - probability density functions ( qpdfs ) which are the fourier transforms of the quasi - characteristic functions ( qcfs ) @xcite , with the latter being the quantum expectations of the weyl operators .",
    "the phase - space approach allows the quantum dynamics to be represented without the `` burden of the hilbert space '' and leads to partial differential and integro - differential equations for the qpdfs and qcfs , which involve only real or complex variables and encode the moments of the system operators .",
    "although the moyal equations @xcite for the qpdf dynamics were originally obtained for closed systems , the phase - space approach has also extensions to different classes of open quantum systems ; see , for example , @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the phase - space approach is applied to the filtering problem for a class of nonlinear quantum stochastic systems with multichannel field measurements satisfying the nondemolition conditions .",
    "the system variables satisfy the weyl canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) and are governed by a markovian qsde driven by the quantum wiener processes of bosonic fields in vacuum state . using the weyl quantization of the hamiltonian and system - field coupling operators in combination with the results of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we obtain a stochastic integro - differential equation ( side ) for the evolution of the posterior qcf of the system conditioned on the measurements .",
    "this equation is a spatial frequency domain representation of the bkse driven by the innovation process associated with the measurements .",
    "we also discuss a more specific form of the posterior qcf and qpdf dynamics for a class @xcite of open quantum systems whose coupling operators are linear functions of the system variables while the hamiltonian is split into a quadratic part and a nonquadratic part represented in the weyl quantization form . for this linear system - field coupling case , we outline modified quantum kalman filter equations for a gaussian approximation of the posterior system state .",
    "we also mention that the weyl quantization of the hamiltonian and coupling operators has recently been used in @xcite in a different context of optimality conditions for coherent ( measurement - free ) quantum control and filtering problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sys ] describes the class of quantum stochastic systems under consideration .",
    "section  [ sec : meas ] specifies the model of nondemolition measurements and describes the bkse for conditional expectations .",
    "section  [ sec : side ] applies this equation to the weyl operators and obtains the posterior qcf dynamics in the weyl quantization framework .",
    "section  [ sec : hlin ] specifies these results , together with a related equation for the posterior qpdf , for the case of linear system - field coupling .",
    "section  [ sec : gauss ] develops modified quantum kalman filter equations for a gaussian approximation of the posterior quantum state .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] provides concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an open quantum system , whose internal dynamics are affected by interaction with external fields and are described in terms of an even number @xmath0 of dynamic variables @xmath1 assembled into a vector @xmath2 ( vectors are assumed to be organized as columns ) .",

    "the squared @xmath284-distance in ( [ proxphi ] ) is not the only possible proximity criterion .",

    "both @xmath299 and @xmath300 are hermitian with respect to @xmath146 .",

    "hence , @xmath311 here , the operator @xmath303 is given by ( [ cs ] ) and originates from the relation @xmath312 for any @xmath295 and an @xmath149-valued gaussian random vector @xmath37 with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath313 , which follows from the isserlis theorem @xcite .",
    "the mixed moments of arbitrary odd order for the entries of such a vector vanish .",
    "positive definiteness ( and hence , invertibility ) of the operator @xmath303 follows from the inequalities @xmath314 for any @xmath315 .",

    "substitution of the gradient vector @xmath319 into ( [ fff ] ) leads to ( [ lamopt0 ] ) . by a similar reasoning , a combination of ( [ sigopt ] ) and ( [ uuuu ] ) with ( [ ff ] ) and ( [ fg ] ) allows @xmath109 to be uniquely found as @xmath320 substitution of the hessian matrix @xmath321 of ( [ mom ] ) into ( [ ffff ] ) leads to ( [ sigopt0 ] )",
    "the equations ( [ lamopt0 ] ) and ( [ sigopt0 ] ) provide integral representations of the correction terms @xmath301 and @xmath109 in the modified quantum kalman filter ( [ dmuprox ] ) , ( [ sigmadotprox ] ) as nonlinear functions of @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "these integrals involve the spatial fourier transform @xmath218 of the nonquadratic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "their closed - form evaluation is possible , for example , if @xmath218 is a linear combination of quadratic - exponential functions ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) ) , which corresponds to the presence of gaussian - shaped `` bumps '' in the potential energy of the system @xcite .",
    "this consideration can be used in order to apply the above results to open quantum systems with multiextremum energy landscapes . however",
    ", open questions in regard to the gaussian approximation , described above , include its error analysis and the study of conditions when ( [ sigmadotprox ] ) produces a physically meaningful matrix @xmath257 satisfying the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath280 .",
    "for a class of quantum stochastic systems , whose hamiltonian and coupling operators are represented in the weyl quantization form , we have obtained a nonlinear side for the evolution of the posterior qcf conditioned on multichannel nondemolition measurements .",
    "this equation is driven by a classical diffusion process of innovations associated with the measurements .",
    "we have also considered a more specific form of the side for the case of linear system - field coupling and outlined a gaussian approximation of the posterior state governed by modified quantum kalman filter equations .",
    "these ideas are applicable to the development of suboptimal quantum filtering algorithms which employ more complicated ( for example , multi - gaussian ) approximations of the posterior qcf and qpdf .",
    "furthermore , the results of this paper can be extended to more general system dynamics , field states and measurement settings ( such as nonlinear coupling , coherent and gaussian states and photon counting measurements ) , for some of which the bkse was considered in @xcite without using the weyl quantization of the hamiltonian and coupling operators .",
