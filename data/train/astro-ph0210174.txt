    "m33 is a nearby ( 795 kpc , @xcite ) sc galaxy .",
    "its nucleus is the brightest x - ray source in the local group : with a luminosity of @xmath6 erg / sec , it accounts for @xmath7 of the total luminosity of the galaxy in the 0.15 - 4.5 kev band @xcite .",
    "the nature of this source ( m33-x8 in @xcite ) is still unclear . because of its position , coincident with the optical center of the galaxy",
    ", it has been suggested that x8 could be a low - luminosity agn ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but this interpretation has two main drawbacks : no activity has been found in other energy bands and an upper limit of only @xmath8 has been put on the mass of the central black hole @xcite . @xcite",
    "have found an apparent periodicity of @xmath9 days in a set of rosat data with a six years coverage , that they ascribe to a `` superorbital '' modulation in a binary system with a giant star orbiting around a black hole .",
    "however , this finding has not been confirmed by the subsequent observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that failed to match the phase prediction .",
    "today , the most favoured hypothesis is that m33-x8 is an intermediate ( or even stellar ) mass black hole , likely in a binary system .",
    "recent studies with asca and bepposax data @xcite agree in describing its x - ray energy spectrum with a power - law with a high energy exponential cutoff with @xmath10 kev @xmath11-folding energy , or with a multicolor disk black - body ( mcd ) , both consistent with the spectra of galactic black - hole candidates and of ultra luminous sources ( ulxs , see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we examine a chandra / acis - s observation of the nucleus of m33 , and we discuss its variability and spectral characteristics .",
    "m33 was observed with chandra / acis on july 6th 2001 ( obs i d : 2023 ) , with an exposure time of 91.8 ksec .",
    "the observation was pointed to the star formation region ngc604 , with the aimpoint on acis - i , therefore the nucleus of the galaxy is @xmath12 off - axis and falls on acis - s3 .",
    "though the image of the nucleus is highly degraded , this proves to be an advantage in terms of spectral and temporal analysis , as the photons from the nuclear source are not affected by pile - up effects , a major problem if the source were on - axis .",
    "due to the degradation of the point spread function ( psf ) with increasing off - axis angle , the source appears distorted and elongated with an elliptical shape .",
    "the source counts were thus extracted from an elliptical region centered on the position of m33-x8 as determined from rosat / hri data by @xcite , i.e. ra=@xmath13 , dec=@xmath14 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the axes of the ellipse were determined examining the radial profiles along the two main direction of the psf and chosing the radii that enclose 99% of the emission in each direction , namely 40 and 25 arcsec , with a major axis position angle of @xmath15 .",
    "the background was extracted from a concentric elliptical annular region with 110 and 70 arcsec major and minor semi - axes respectively , excluding the portions of the annulus falling outside the chip .",
    "the data analysis was performed using different tools in the ciao 2.1 software package , the imaging application ds9 v.2.1 , the timing analysis software package xronos v.5.18 and the spectral analysis software xspec v11.2 .",
    "the observation is continuous with a time coverage of 91.8 ksec , an average count rate of @xmath16 counts / sec in the 0.2 - 8.0 kev band and a time resolution of 3.24 s , that allows for a detailed temporal analysis with moderate resolution .",
    "the light - curve of m33-x8 has been binned in 40 intervals , each 2250 s long .",
    "the source is evidently variable : the light curves show a significant variability of more than 10% from maximum to minimum ( figure  [ ltc]- panel a ) .",
    "panels b , c , d in figure  [ ltc ] show the light - curve in three energy sub - ranges ( 0.2 - 1.5 kev , 1.5 - 4.5 kev , 4.5 - 8.0 kev ) , chosen to search for energy - dependent variability : the soft band samples the spectral region that hosts most of the absorption edges and spectral lines , the medium and hard bands cover the continuum and their ratio measures the slope of the continuum itself .",
    "we applied to each band ( including the full band ) various tests : the kolmogorov - smirnof test ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath17 test , the collura test ( a phase averaged @xmath17 test plus an interpretation with a pulse model , @xcite ) .",
    "these tests ( see table  [ tflux ] ) confirm the presence of variability with high statistical significance in the full band and in the soft and medium bands .",
    "the collura test indicates a variability timescale of @xmath18 sec for the total , soft and medium bands .",
    "the hardness ratio plotted in figure  [ ltc ] ( panel e ) is calculated as @xmath19 where hard ( h ) is the number of counts in the 1.5 - 8.0 kev band and soft ( s ) is the number of counts in the 0.2 - 1.5 kev band .",
    "this curve strongly suggests that some spectral variability occurred during the observation .",
    "a @xmath17 test against the hypothesis of constant value ( equal to the average value ) gives @xmath20 , with a 2% probability that the hardness ratio is constant .",
    "as suggested by figure  [ ltc ] and , more strongly , by figure  [ colhr ] , there is a correlation between the medium + hard band flux and the hardness ratio .",
    "this suggests that the variability is stronger in these bands than in the soft one .",
    "we find no evidence of correlations between total flux and hardness ratio ( figure  [ colhr ] , bottom panel ) , and x - ray colors with changing flux ( figure  [ hr - col ] ) .",
    "colors are defined as r1= medium / soft and r2=hard / medium , with soft , medium and hard energy bands as in table  [ tflux ] ( see also figure  [ ltc ] ) .    a power spectrum analysis performed on the photon counts with a 3.24 s resolution in the frequency range @xmath21 hz yields a flat frequency distribution that can be fit with a single power law with a slope of @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and is consistent within @xmath24 with the poisson noise in the frequency range sampled by the observation .",
    "l l l l l avg count rate & @xmath25 c / s & @xmath26 c / s & @xmath27 c / s & @xmath28 c / s + rms frac.var . & 2.5 % & 2.2% & 3.3% & + @xmath29 & 148.8/37 & 98.8/37 & 107.8/37 & 39.1/37 + ks probability&@xmath30&@xmath31&@xmath32&@xmath33 + timescale & @xmath1 s & @xmath1 s & @xmath18 s & + [ tflux ]",
    "the source spectrum appears to be affected by a pha to pi conversion problem that causes spurious emission and absorption features between @xmath34 and @xmath35 kev . pending resolution of this problem ,",
    "the spectral analysis has been conducted excluding the energy range affected by this problem .",
    "this left us with two data ranges : 0.3 - 1.5 kev and 2.5 - 8.0 kev , that were analyzed simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the spectrum has been corrected for the quantum efficiency degradation of acis at low energies , using the ciao tool corrarf .",
    "we find that the total spectrum can be described with a three components model : a powerlaw with @xmath36 , a mcd with kt@xmath37 and a raymond - smith model ( rs ) with kt@xmath38 and solar abundance .",
    "the residuals , however , still show an excess at @xmath39 kev , that can be fitted with a gaussian at @xmath40 kev with @xmath41 kev .",
    "after this new component , the reduced @xmath17 becomes 1.27 , with an improvement of 82 over 3 additional d.o.f .",
    ", yielding an f - test probability lower than 0.1% . this bump could be the signature of an overabundance of fe and/or ne in an environment of warm matter .",
    "we thus tried to model it by allowing the fe and ne abundance to vary in the rs model , but the model was not able to reproduce it : the best result has been obtained having the ne abundance four times higher than the solar value , but the residuals still show a narrow gaussian - like feature at 1 kev that can not be accounted for by varying the abundance of other elements .",
    "thus , the feature can not be associated unambiguosly to any of the continuum components .",
    "figure  [ specf ] shows the best fit model residuals , including also the range that has been excluded from the fit .",
    "it also shows that there is no evidence of any systematic excess in the residuals , thus the value of the reduced @xmath17 can be entirely ascribed to the statistic scattering of the data .",
    "the full set of best fit parameter values is reported in table  [ fit ] .",
    "the total flux is @xmath42 erg sec@xmath43@xmath44 , that , at the distance of m33 , gives a luminosity of @xmath45 erg s@xmath43 .",
    "the flux of the rs component is roughly consistent with the value of the 20  extended emission reported by @xcite with rosat / hri . to investigate this possibility further ,",
    "we extracted the spectrum of the circumnuclear region of m33 x-8 from one of the publicly archived on - axis observations of this source ( obs i d : 786 , exposure time : 50 ksec ) , using the same elliptical region described in section  [ data ] but excluding a circle with radius 4.92  ( 10pixels ) centered on the nuclear source ( heavily piled up in this observation ) . the resulting spectrum ( @xmath46 counts )",
    "does not match the rs in either shape or intensity .",
    "it can be well described by a power - law with @xmath47 , with a flux of @xmath48 erg sec@xmath43@xmath44 in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band ( @xmath49 erg / s ) , @xmath501/4 of the rs flux .",
    "so , most of the rs component originates from a region with a radius smaller than @xmath51  , corresponding to @xmath52 pc at the distance of m33 .      figure  [ ltc]-e suggests spectral variability . in order to investigate further this variability",
    ", we have divided the data into three phases , according to the value of the hardness ratio .",
    "we define the `` _ hr - low _ ''",
    "state as the one where the hardness ratio ( hr ) is lower than -0.22 , the `` _ hr - medium _ '' state as the one with -0.22@xmath53hr@xmath53 - 0.18 and the `` _ hr - high _ '' state as the one where hr@xmath54 - 0.18 .",
    "we have selected three spectra according to this criterion and we have analyzed them separately , using the same spectral component as in section  [ intspec ] .",
    "the results are in table  [ fit ] .",
    "we find that the gaussian component is not needed for the _ hr - low _ and _ hr - high _ states .",
    "this is not surprising , as each of these spectra includes only @xmath55 of the total counts of the source , and the gaussian component is relatively faint .",
    "examining the other two spectral components we find that : * a ) * the power - law photon index @xmath56 does not change significantly in the three spectra , while the flux decreases from the _ hr - low _ to the _ hr - medium _ and _ hr - high _ states ; * b ) * the errors of the mcd components in the _ hr - low _ state are rather large , however there is evidence of the disk kt increasing from the medium to the hard state ; * c ) * we do not detect any variability in the rs , consistent with possibly extended emission from hot ism .",
    "figure  [ comp ] shows the three spectra , deconvolved from the instrumental response , with the best fit model components . from this figure",
    "we see a progression of larger mcd contribution ( relatively to the power - law ) going from the _ hr - low _ to the _ hr - high _ spectral states .",

    "the light curve of m33-x8 shows a significant low - amplitude variability , with a @xmath0 variation on a timescale of a few thousands of seconds .",
    "this timescale is particularly evident both in the full band light curve , where the source count rate drops and suddenly goes back to the original value in @xmath106 , and in the medium band light curve , where the count rate oscillates a few times around its average value of @xmath107 c / s .",
    "this result strongly confirms the variability on a 3000 s timescale found by @xcite in the _ einstein _ data of the nucleus of m33 .",
    "however , the power spectrum is flat , and does not evidence any periodical or quasi - periodical oscillation .",
    "the hardness ratio is also variable , showing evidence of spectral variability , that appears to be correlated mostly with the emission at energy @xmath108 kev .",
    "the spectral analysis reveals the presence of four components .",
    "two of these , a raymond - smith component and a broad `` gaussian '' line feature contribute relatively little to the total spectrum , and do not present any compelling evidence of variability .",
    "we will not discuss them any further .",
    "the two main components are a strong @xmath109 power - law and a kt@xmath110 kev multicolor disk component ( mcd ) .",
    "the parameters of the power - law and of the mcd are in good agreement with the results found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , their contribution to the total spectrum is variable , as showed by the hr - selected spectra ( table  [ fit ] ) : the _ hr - low _ phase is characterized by a brighter power - low and a fainter disk .",
    "while we do not find any further variation of the power - law flux from the _ hr - medium _ to the _ hr - high _ state , the mcd flux seems to increase with increasing kt .",
    "this result may suggest that the variability is linked with fluctuations in the accretion rate .    for the mcd component , the lower limit of 37 km to the inner radius of the disk ( table  [ fit ] ; the limit is due to the presence of the @xmath77 factor accounting for the inclination angle of the disk ) implies a lower limit to the mass of the compact object of @xmath111 .",
    "the eddington limit for this mass is l@xmath112 erg / sec , that is consistent with the power - law + disk emission of the source .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusion of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that m33 x-8 is most likely a normal binary system containing a stellar mass black hole that happens to be at the center of the galaxy , rather than an agn .",
    "although not extreme , the spectral variability of m33 x-8 is reminiscent of what has been observed in black hole binaries . in the galactic black hole binaries",
    "we usually observe a `` high / soft state '' , dominated by a hot disk , sometimes associated with a faint power - law tail , and a `` low / hard state '' dominated by a power - law spectrum , with a colder disk component ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the soft state is explained with high accretion rate , with the accreting disk going down toward the last stable orbit , while the hard state is associated to a lower accretion rate that causes the disruption of the inner part of the disk and the presence of a comptonized corona wrapping the central source . in the case of m33",
    "x-8 both disk and power - law component are always present , but the power - law dominated _ hr - low _ state corresponds with a lower flux in the medium energy band ( 1.5 - 4.5 kev ) . with",
    "increasing medium band flux the spectrum evolves to be dominated by the disk component .",
    "the source that resembles more m33 x-8 is probably lmc x-3 @xcite , a black hole candidate with a probable mass of @xmath113 and a luminosity of up to @xmath114 erg / s .",
    "m33 x-8 presents many similarities with lmc x-3 : the thermal spectrum , that can be modelled with a mcd ( with kt@xmath115 in lmc x-3 and kt@xmath116 in m33 x-8 ) and a steep power - law ; the presence of variability on timescales of some ten thousands of seconds ; a long timescale periodicity ( 116 d for m33 x-8 and 99 or 198 d for lmc x-3 , see @xcite and @xcite ) that appears to vary or even disappear in a few years @xcite . also , lmc x-3 is characterized by a lack of fast variability ( on timescales @xmath117 s ) , but this feature can not be investigated in m33 x-8 , due to the lack of data with high enough temporal resolution .",
    "however the power - law component is relatively more prominent in m33 x-8 .",
    "concluding , the _ chandra _ spectral variability observations of the nucleus of m33 ( x-8 ) strongly agree with the suggestion that this source is an accreting @xmath118 m@xmath5 black hole with a variable accretion disk , comparable to galactic black hole binaries .    we thank m. krauss and f. nicastro for their help in solving the calibration problems , j. macdowell for interesting discussions and a. kong , d. schwartz and j. drake for useful comments on the manuscript .",
