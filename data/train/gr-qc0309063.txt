    "a great deal of effort has recently gone into the study of higher - dimensional models as unified theories of gravity and fundamental matter fields .",
    "the original interest in such models in kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) theory @xcite was revived by the important role of dimension 11 in supergravity @xcite and more recently by superstring theory @xcite and m - theory @xcite , which favour spacetimes of dimension 10 and 11 respectively .",
    "the usual ( kk ) argument for the apparent 4-dimensionality of spacetime is that the extra dimensions are compactified i.e curled up sufficiently small so as not to conflict with observation .",
    "however , recently much attention has been placed instead on string - theory - inspired models with large extra dimensions @xcite in which most of the physics is confined or closely - bound to a lower - dimensional braneworld surrounded by a higher - dimensional bulk .    though motivated by superstring and m - theories , many of these models @xcite are in fact formulated within the framework of ( higher - dimensional ) general relativity ( gr ) . among these are : 1 ) the second randall ",
    "sundrum scenario @xcite in which the graviton is tightly - bound to the brane by the curvature due to the warping of the bulk metric , which is pure anti - desitter ( ads ) .",
    "2 ) a more general scheme of shiromizu , maeda and sasaki ( sms ) @xcite , in which the 4-dimensional einstein field equations ( efe s ) are replaced by 4-d `` braneworld efe s '' ( befe s ) , which are not closed since there is a ` dark energy ' weyl tensor term , knowledge of which requires solving also for the bulk .",
    "the interpretational difficulties due to this constitute the ` weyl problem ' .",
    "the other main distinctive feature of sms s befe s is the presence of a term quadratic in the braneworld energy - momentum , which arises from the junction condition used @xcite .",
    "two important questions arise in consideration of such models .",
    "* q1 : * how should such models be built and interpreted consistently within the framework of gr ?",
    "this would require a careful underlying choice of conceptually - clear general framework , in the sense we discuss below .",
    "* q2 : * what exactly is the connection between such models and the underlying string / m theory ?",
    "more precisely , to what extent can the agreements or otherwise of predictions of such models with observations be taken as support or disagreement with such theories ? here",
    "we concentrate on the first question and make a comparative study of the general schemes that have been employed in the literature in order to construct the bulks which surround branes .",
    "such a comparative study requires a sufficiently general common language .",
    "we use that of _ p.d.e problems , which consist of both the p.d.e system to be solved in some region of a manifold , and data prescribed on ( portions of ) the boundary of this region . for ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) a spacetime of dimension @xmath3 with @xmath2 time dimensions , we denote the problem involving the addition of an extra dimension by ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 if the new dimension is spacelike or @xmath6 if it is timelike .",
    "this is the generalization of the gr cauchy problem ( cp ) @xcite based on the arbitrary ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) generalization of the arnowitt ",
    "misner @xcite split of the metric ( sec 2.1 ) and hypersurface geometry ( sec 2.2 ) .",
    "its simple signature - independent features are pointed out in sec 2.3 and the crucial dependence of many of the harder features on the usual cp signatures @xmath7 , @xmath8 is discussed in sec 2.4 . as is well - known , the gr cp presupposes the existence of the data .",
    "thus one is in fact considering a two - step process , the other step being the construction of the data on the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) manifold i.e the generalization of the gr initial value problem ( ivp ) @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in sec 3 . _",
    "our framework permits a profitable look at a number of recent topics .",
    "the aim is to consider gr - based models containing thin matter sheets such as branes or domain walls .",
    "we shall compare two broad schemes that have been proposed to construct bulks : the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) construction @xcite starting from information on a    ( 3 , 1 ) spacetime hypersurface ( usually the brane ) and the ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) construction @xcite starting by the construction of data on a ( 4 , 0 ) spatial hypersurface .",
    "however , first we emphasize that one should grasp the fundamental arguments and results which before the specializing to the thin matter sheet models . a few ideas about the general unspecialized framework recently arose in the literature on ( generalizations of ) the campbell  magaard arbitrary - signature embedding theorem @xcite ( see sec 2.3 ) .",
    "however , we find it far more profitable instead to adopt the generalized gr cp ",
    "ivp point of view since this literature is by far more developed and thus a far greater source of well - documented pitfalls and carefully thought - out techniques which avoid them .",
    "we identify the embedding step of the campbell  magaard theorem with the well - known signature - independent parts of the gr cp in sec 2.3 .",
    "but the harder @xmath7 , @xmath8 specific parts of the gr cp strongly suggest that ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) schemes should be favoured over ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) ones on very general grounds : well - posedness and causality ( sec 2.4 ) .",
    "furthermore , magaard s data construction method @xcite ( sec 3.1 ) does not compare favourably with york s data construction @xcite ( sec 3.2 ) , and its application to @xmath9 , @xmath5 has further conceptual difficulties . in this light",
    "we look at the extent to which york s method is adaptable to @xmath9 , @xmath5 , and also consider the thin sandwich method @xcite in this context ( sec 3.3 ) .",
    "we then introduce thin matter sheets in sec 4 , and study the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes with thin matter sheets , recollecting the derivation of the junction conditions ( sec 4.1 ) , and showing how the sms formulation ( sec 4.2 ) may be reformulated in a large number of ways using geometrical identities that interchange which terms are present in the braneworld efe s .",
    "this is illustrated by the formulation in sec 4.3 which directly parallels the gr cp formulation and thus makes no explicit use of the weyl term , and by formulations in sec 4.4 in which the quadratic term has been re - expressed entirely in terms of derivatives off the brane .",
    "these formulations are used to clarify a number of aspects of the ` weyl problem ' , in particular to argue for the study of the full brane - bulk system .",
    "further aspects of such formulations are discussed in sec 4.5 .",
    "the implications of sec 2.4 for thin matter sheets , the heuristic use and limitations of the ( 3 , 1 ) york method with thin matter sheets , and formulations of thin matter sheet thin sandwich conjectures are discussed in sec 4.6 .",
    "having gathered arguments against using ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes in secs 2.4 and 3 , we further consolidate this viewpoint by arguing in sec 5 against a suggested virtue of ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes @xcite : their use to remove singularities .",
    "in addition to using the framework of sec 2 , the corresponding study of geodesics is also used here , which presents further conceptual complications relevant to thin matter sheet models .",
    "these follow from the    ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics not usually being among the ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics .    in sec 6 , we continue the study of the ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) scheme favoured by our arguments , in the presence of both thin and thick ( i.e finitely thin ) matter sheets .",
    "we begin in sec 6.1 by providing a hierarchy of very difficult general thin matter sheet problems in which the main difficulties stem from low differentiability and details about the asymptotics . within this class of problems",
    "we identify how the far more specific scenarios currently studied emerge as more tractable cases , and thus identify which as - yet unjustified assumptions such studies entail .",
    "the ivp step , of use in the study of how braneworld black holes extend into the bulk ( the ` pancake ' versus ` cigar ' debate @xcite ) , involves fewer of such assumptions .",
    "thus in this paper we restrict attention to the ( @xmath10 , 0 ) data construction problem ( sec 6.2 ) , which we apply to thin matter sheets in sec 6.3 and more straightforwardly to thick matter sheets in sec 6.4 .. sec 7 discusses * q2 and contains the conclusions of this paper as regards * q1 . * *",
    "in this section , we give splittings of efe s with respect to a hypersurface of codimension 1 .",
    "this results in 2 systems of equations that are treated as constituting two separate steps .",
    "the first , embedding or evolution step , will be dealt with in this section and the second , data construction step , will be presented in sec 3 .",
    "the embedding step includes the gr cauchy problem ( cp ) for @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "we work with general ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) since many applications of interest have @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "our approach is to treat the general case as far as possible , while taking careful note of the many important roles played by the signatures @xmath4 and especially @xmath2 ( whereas a change in the dimension @xmath10 plays only a mild role ) .",
    "an important point regarding the well - known analytic p.d.e system approach employed here is the identification of the input to be prescribed and the output to expect . with the advent of schemes to construct bulks @xcite , the old questions regarding these prescriptions have become relevant in a new context .",
    "we begin by recalling the arbitrary ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) arnowitt - deser  misner ( adm ) @xcite type split w.r.t the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) ` initial ' hypersurface @xmath11 of the higher - dimensional metric @xmath12 along with the split of its inverse @xmath13 ,    ll g_cd = (    ll _ i^i + ^2 & _ d + _ c & h_cd    ) , g^cd = (    ll & - + - & h^cd + +    )    .",
    "[ adms ] the geometric interpretation of ( and further notation for ) the ( @xmath10 , 0 , 1 ) and ( @xmath1 , 1 , 1 ) splits discussed in this paper are exhibited in fig .",
    "1 . for the specific adm case , the added dimension ( of signature @xmath8 ) is time , and the lower - dimensional hypersurface is 3-dimensional and entirely spatial : ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) = ( 3 , 0 ) .",
    "the efe s are then decomposed into 4 constraints and 6 evolution equations ( sec 2.3 ) .",
    "the gr ivp and cp are defined w.r.t this split .",
    "the gr ivp is the solution of the 4 constraints [ on some region @xmath14 of some ( 3 , 0 ) initial hypersurface @xmath15 for initial data @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature k_ab = -_h_ab , [ ecd ] which is a measure of how much the hypersurface is bent in the surrounding spacetime .",
    "this data , together with the 6 evolution equations ( for @xmath18 ) and the 6 equations for @xmath19 which follow from ( [ ecd ] ) constitute the gr cp .",
    "this is a ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) problem for the construction of the spacetime region in which @xmath14 is embedded .",
    "it is useful to juxtapose here another metric split , the arbitrary ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) kk type split    ll g_cd = (    ll ^2 & ^2a_d + ^2a_c & h_cd + ^2a_ca_d    ) , g^cd = (    ll a_ma^m + ^2 & - a^d + - a^c & h^cd    )    , [ kks ] so as to discuss some of the literature @xcite .",
    "note first that for kk theory itself , this split is ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 held to be independent of the added dimension s coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "this so - called cylindricity condition implicitly permits @xmath21 to be interpreted as the classical electromagnetic potential .",
    "more recent generalizations of this scheme , called ` noncompact kk ( nkk ) theory ' @xcite , have involved large extra dimensions in place of cylindricity , by permitting @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 to depend on @xmath23 . in some simple instances , @xmath21",
    "is held to be 0 .",
    "but clearly for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the two splits ( [ adms ] ) and ( [ kks ] ) are identical .",
    "so there is already a vast literature on embeddings with a large extra dimension since this is what is usually treated in the gr cp .    in sec 4 , we reinterpret ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) methods such as that of sms as _ z - dynamics i.e  dynamics \" with the coordinate of the new dimension , @xmath23 , as  dynamical variable \" .",
    "note that such a  dynamical \" interpretation was of no avail in kk theory proper , for there @xmath20 was taken to be independent of @xmath23 .",
    "note also that although a way of relating sms s befe s and nkk has been pointed out @xcite , we emphasize that it is far more useful as here to relate the steps leading to sms s befe s to the gr cp and ivp literature , since this is by far more developed and thus a good source of ideas and theorems , on which the critical sec 2.4 is based . _",
    "gauss _ outstanding theorem _",
    "( @xmath26 for a 2-sphere embedded in flat 3-space ) already provides a good intuitive feel both of why matter squared terms arise in brane cosmology and of why intrinsic curvature singularities can in principle be removed upon applying an embedding by being balanced out by extrinsic - curvature - squared terms .",
    "we work with the suitable generalization of this theorem : the ( @xmath10 + 1)-dimensional geometry of projections w.r.t a ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) hypersurface .",
    "we use @xmath27 for projections onto the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) hypersurface @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for projections onto the normal .",
    "the three projections of the riemann tensor @xcite are respectively the gauss , the codazzi and the ricci equations : _ abcd = r_abcd - 2k_a[ck_d]b , [ gaussful ] _ abc = -2d_[ck_b]a , [ codful ] _ ab = ( _ k_ab - d_bd_a ) + k_a^ck_cb .",

    "[ protoray ]    we now consider the simpler results of the ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) gr cp , most of which hold irrespective of both @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "first , there is the two - step nature of the problem for the whole efe system .",
    "*  evolution \" or embedding step : given as data @xmath16 together with coordinate functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , all on some portion @xmath41 of @xmath11 , such that the constraints are satisfied , one is to solve the evolution equations ( [ ecd ] ) and ( [ evk ] ) as a prescription for evaluating @xmath16 on some portion @xmath42 of a nearby @xmath43 i.e for a small increment of the dynamical variable @xmath33 .",

    "*    second , provided that the constraints hold on some `` initial '' @xmath41 , they are guaranteed to hold throughout the embedding spacetime region .",
    "this is most quickly seen by virtue of energy - momentum conservation and the bianchi identities @xcite , making use of the einstein tensor projection form of the constraints .",
    "third , constraints come hand - in - hand with gauge freedoms .",
    "thus @xmath44 of the metric components are freely - specifiable . for many applications a choice of gauge",
    "is required . to begin with we mostly use the _ normal coordinate gauge ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , and",
    "the _ harmonic gauge @xcite ( coordinates @xmath47 such that @xmath48 ) , though we use more elaborate gauge choices later .",
    "we stress that careful consideration of gauge choice can be an important ingredient toward producing prescriptions that are generally robust and physically clear @xcite . _ _",
    "fourth , by choice of a suitable gauge it can be ascertained by the cauchy ",
    "kovalevskaya ( ck ) theorem @xcite for admissible analytic data that there locally exists a unique solution to the  evolution equations \" ( [ evk ] ) .    for this and further applications in the gr cp , the harmonic gauge is usually chosen . in the ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 )",
    "gr cp , the use instead of the normal gauge is discouraged because in practice it typically breaks down quickly . to see this recall that in normal gauge equation ( [ protoray ] ) may be written as the normal raychaudhuri equation - = k^ k^ + r _ 0 , [ normray ] where the inequality follows from the definition of the strong energy condition ( sec ) : _ abu^au^b 0 u^a , [ protosec ] by picking @xmath49 . to make ( [ protosec ] ) manifestly an energy condition , one uses the efe s to obtain",

    "this blowup is by definition a _ caustic and signifies a breakdown of the normal coordinates .",
    "however , for the ( @xmath1 , 1 ; 1 ) embedding @xmath54 is spacelike .",
    "there is then no good reason for @xmath55 to be always positive , so caustics may be less likely to form .",
    "the issue of the longevity of normal coordinates is of interest because they have hitherto been used for some of the applications below .",
    "other applications below fix @xmath46 alone .",
    "_    an embedding result we discuss below is the campbell  magaard ( cm ) theorem , according to which any @xmath10-space can be surrounded by @xmath10 + 1 dimensional vacuum space , where the spaces in question are analytic .",
    "this is closely related to the above split of the efe s ; in particular it has an embedding step which we consider in this section and a data construction step , ` magaard s method ' , which we consider in sec 3.1 .",
    "the embedding step of the cm theorem is simply the result above based on the ck theorem , which is well - known for the gr cp , and follows for the other ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) embedding cases from the well - known insensitivity of the ck theorem to ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) .",
    "strictly , the cm result is the vacuum case ( @xmath56 ) but the proof may easily be extended to any functional form of @xmath57 @xcite since the use throughout of the ck theorem is totally insensitive to changes in such subleading order terms ( contributions to @xmath58 ) .",
    "there have been suggestions that such @xcite or similar @xcite ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) methods could be used for the construction of bulks .",
    "however , even though the above results in the ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) case of the gr cp are protected and extended by a host of further theorems , they do not carry over to the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) case , as we argue in the next section .",
    "there are also problems with ( 3 , 1 ) data construction , as we shall see in sec 3 .      in this section",
    "we argue by further comparison with the gr cp that the popular practise of building bulks by @xmath23-dynamics is in general unsatisfactory .",
    "for , in the gr cp a large number of important results @xcite for the gr cp turn out to be entirely dependent on the lower - dimensional signature @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , the choice of methods which properly respect the difference between space and time is absolutely crucial .    to have a sensible problem in mathematical physics ,",
    "one requires not just local existence and uniqueness of solutions but rather _ well - posedness .",
    "whereas well - posedness always includes local existence and uniqueness , it also always includes continuous dependence of the data , without which an arbitrarily small change in the data could cause an arbitrarily large immediate change in the evolution @xcite i.e there is no guarantee of physical predictability from such a problem . for a hyperbolic - type system one",
    "further requires a domain of dependence ( dod ) property to enforce a sensible notion of causality .",
    "if the data is known only on a closed achronal set @xmath59 _    ( that is , a piece of a spacelike hypersurface ) , then the evolution can only be predicted within a region @xmath60 ( the future dod ) , defined as the set of points such that all past - inextendible causal curves through each point [ represented by the @xmath61 s leading to the point @xmath62 in fig .",
    "4a ) ] intersect @xmath59 . in our view causality can effectively be studied only in settings where the dynamical variable is time .",
    "one reason for this is that given information on an arbitrarily - thin ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurface , the ( 4 , 1)-dimensional dod is negligible because of this thinness ( see fig .",
    "other reasons are discussed below .",
    "now we note that the cauchy ",
    "kovalevskaya theorem has no control whatsoever over these last two properties for the analytic functions .",
    "there are furthermore two reasons why the analytic functions are undesirable .",
    "first , the analytic functions fail to be appropriate for any causal study since they are rigid ( a change in a small region of an analytic data set induces an unwanted change of the entire data set ) . without them",
    "one absolutely can not have anything like the extremally general ( and in particular signature - insensitive ) cauchy  kovalevskaya theorem .",
    "second , realistic and ( or ) interesting situations seldom involve analytic or smooth functions .",
    "for example astrophysical bodies have boundaries , thin matter sheets are discontinuous and the approach to spacetime singularities can be of low differentiability .",
    "bruhat showed that the gr cp is well - posed in 1952 ( @xcite ) and 1956 ( @xcite ) , by making use of how the    ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) efe system ( [ gauss][evk ] ) when cast in harmonic coordinates is of the correct quasilinear hyperbolic form @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is a lorentzian metric ; both this and the function @xmath65 are smooth ) to enable use of leray s theorem @xcite , which guarantees local existence and uniqueness , and furthermore continuous dependence on the initial data and the dod property .",
    "the above proofs of the four well - posedness criteria for the gr cp are now usually done using _",
    "sobolev spaces @xcite .",
    "these are appropriate because of the hyperbolic character of the einstein evolution equations . at first",
    "they lend themselves to less involved proofs than bruhat s , although if one seeks yet stronger results the functional analysis becomes extremally unpleasant . to recollect simply why sobolev spaces are appropriate @xcite",
    ", it suffices to consider a klein  gordon scalar in minkowski spacetime .",
    "given data on a bounded region @xmath14 of a spacelike hypersurface @xmath66 , one can draw the future dod @xmath67 [ fig .",
    "4a ) ] which is the region affected solely by this data due to the finite propagation speed of light .",
    "one can then consider the values of @xmath68 and its first derivatives on @xmath69 .",
    "then by gauss s ( divergence ) theorem and energy - momentum conservation , _ s_0t_act^at^c + _",
    "bt_acl^at^c = _ s_tt_act^at^c , and the second term @xmath70 provided that the matter obeys the dominant energy condition ( dec ) -t^a_cu^c u^a and that @xmath71 is timelike .",

    "s_t(()^2 + ( ) ^2 + m^2 ^ 2 ) _",
    "s_0(()^2 + ( ) ^2 + m^2 ^ 2 ) [ sums ] because each integrand is the sum of squares ( which are necessarily positive ) , this means that control over the data on @xmath14 gives control of the solution on @xmath72 .",
    "the idea of a sobolev norm is a generalization of these last two ` energy ' integrals @xcite . for later use",
    ", the sobolev class @xmath73 has a bounded norm of this type including up to @xmath74th order derivatives . _",
    "whereas the gr cp comes with important well - posedness theorems @xcite , the ( @xmath1 , 1 ; 1 ) problem is instead a complicated instance of a _ sideways cauchy problem , a category of problem for which the possibility of such well - posedness theorems remains notably undeveloped .",
    "there is quite simply no established way to proceed .",
    "there is no known sideways ( @xmath9 ) analogue of leray s theorem .",
    "there is no known notion of what function spaces might be appropriate for sideways cauchy problems .",
    "we can explain however why the above introduction of sobolev spaces does not carry over to sideways cauchy problems .",
    "first there is no sideways notion of dod to make the construction .",
    "second even if we assume the higher - dimensional dec holds , it would not give an inequality because the perpendicular vector @xmath75 in now spacelike [ fig .",
    "third , we obtain a difference of squares rather than the sums in ( [ sums ] ) , so the equivalent of the energy method s use of sobolev norms is simply of no use to control the  evolution \" given the data . _",
    "several methods have been proposed for the data construction step , including the elimination and conformal methods .",
    "the former methods are intuitive in that the prescribed quantities are all physical , but have a number of undesirable mathematical features .",
    "in contrast , lichnerowicz s conformal method @xcite is counterintuitive , since some of the prescribed quantities are unphysical , but exploits the mathematical properties of the constraint system in order to decouple it .",
    "bruhat s argument @xcite was in favour of the latter , however , some of her criticisms need to be elaborated upon to cover magaard s elimination method @xcite .",
    "sec 3.1 covers this question and provides further criticisms in the @xmath9 case . in sec 3.2 ,",
    "we discuss the desirable features of york s development of the conformal method @xcite , paying careful attention to the signature - dependent ones .",
    "the thin sandwich and hamiltonian methods are briefly discussed in sec 3.3 .",
    "an example of this method of data construction is employed in the last part of the cm result ( `` magaard s method '' @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss and compare this method with the standard method used for the gr ivp .",
    "magaard s method ( 1963 ) treats the lower - dimensional metric @xmath76 as a known .",
    "here we use a more transparent notation than magaard s , in which the gauss constraint ( [ gauss ] ) takes the form g^abcdk_abk_cd + r + 2= 0 where @xmath77 is the ( undensitized ) inverse of dewitt s supermetric @xcite .",
    "this is then split w.r.t some coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 can be isolated as the solution of the linear equation 2k_11g^11uwk_uw + g^1u1wk_1uk_1w + g^uwxyk_uwk_xy = - ( r + 2 ) ( where @xmath80 , @xmath74 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 @xmath83 ) , provided that it is possible to divide by @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath79 is eliminated from the codazzi constraint ( [ cod ] ) , which is then treated as a p.d.e system for unknowns @xmath85 , some @xmath86 component denoted @xmath87}. on the face of it , this system satisfies the criteria for the ck theorem if one treats @xmath88 \\{all the components of @xmath89 bar @xmath79 , @xmath90 and @xmath87 } as known functions on @xmath78 and provided that the p.d.es coefficients and the data are analytic .",
    "so a unique solution exists . the ( generalized ) cm result @xcite groups this and the local existence of a unique  evolution \" to form the statement that a ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) spacetime with prescribed analytic metric @xmath76 may be embedded with an extra space or time dimension for any analytic functional form of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this statement suggests an incredibly rich collection of embeddings exist .",
    "however , we must point out that this is itself one of many difficulties associated with the cm result and its applicability , that we describe below .",
    "bruhat had already considered the above method in 1956 @xcite in the case of the gr ivp and pointed out a limitation on its validity .",
    "we find that her argument can be made for any signature or dimension : @xmath91 must be a function of at least one unknown , @xmath87 , so we have no control over whether it is zero .",
    "therefore we can not guarantee the validity of the elimination procedure for @xmath79 from the gauss constraint .",
    "although magaard @xcite finds a route round this problem , we find that this leads to two prices to pay later on .",
    "he starts with prescribed ` data for the data ' i.e values of @xmath92 on some @xmath93-dimensional set @xmath94 .",
    "the ` data for the data ' is validly picked so that @xmath95 on @xmath96 , whereupon by continuity there is a thin region @xmath97 within which it is guaranteed that @xmath95 .",
    "thus magaard s procedure produces strips of data to be used in the embedding step .",
    "the first price to pay is that in general we can not expect to be able to patch such strips together to make extended patches of data . for ,",
    "since the strip construction ends where @xmath91 picks up a zero for some @xmath98 , while restarting the procedure with @xmath98 in place of @xmath99 is valid , the two data strips thus produced will have a discontinuity across @xmath98 .",
    "so what one produces is a collection of strips belonging to different possible global data sets . the evolution of each of these strips would produce pieces of different higher - dimensional manifolds .",
    "so one is _ not in fact saying that an empty ( @xmath10 + 1)-dimensional manifold surrounds any @xmath10-dimensional manifold .",
    "rather one is saying that any @xmath10-dimensional manifold can be cut up in an infinite number of ways ( choices of the @xmath78 coordinate ) into many pieces , each of which can be separately bent in an infinite number of ways ( corresponding to the freedom in choosing the components of @xmath17 in @xmath100 on each set of ` data for the data ' ) , and for each of these bent regions we can locally find a surrounding ( @xmath10 + 1)-dimensional manifold for every possible analytic function form of @xmath57 ( corresponding to the generalizability of the cm result ) .",
    "this apparent excess richness raises the question of physical significance of such a construction . _",
    "magaard s method does not state enough assumptions to make it rigorous .",
    "first , how far does ` data for the data ' extend along @xmath99 ? clearly the topology of the @xmath10-dimensional manifold is an important input , for if it is not compact without boundary , there is a missing boundary or asymptotics prescription required .",
    "also the topology of the @xmath99 set itself has not been brought into consideration ( for example continuity is not guaranteed were this to contain loops ) .",
    "secondly , we specifically consider the ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) and ( @xmath1 , 1 ; 1 ) problems as separate cases , since we find that    there are implicit ways in which signature plays a crucial role even for the cm result . for ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) one might worry that the data construction for a strip is flawed because the data problem in question is elliptic and",
    "hence naively requires a global treatment .",
    "however , we are able to dispel this worry once we treat york s method below . for ( @xmath1 , 1 ; 1 ) , the use of the strip @xmath97 as  evolutionary \" data is generally invalidated by the information leak construction in fig . 5 , unless one has had the luck to construct a full global data set .",
    "this would , however , require the building of the data encountering 1 ) no zeros of @xmath91 ( which is thus the second price to pay ) , 2 ) no asymptotic problems .",
    "thus in general there is a severe problem with building ( 4 , 1 ) spacetimes from ( 3 , 1 ) ones using the cm method .",
    "thirdly , magaard s method lacks any @xmath10-dimensional general covariance since it involves the choice of a coordinate @xmath78 and the elimination of a @xmath101-component of a tensor .",
    "the arguments of lichnerowicz @xcite and bruhat @xcite led to the gr ivp taking a very different route from the above sort of brute - force elimination methods .",
    "the conformal method of lichnerowicz and york is instead preferred .",
    "this leads us to ask to what extent conformal methods can be adapted both to heuristic and to general constructions for e.g ( @xmath1 , 1 ; @xmath4 ) data .",
    "therefore our treatment below is as far as possible for the general ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) case .    in the conformal method , one chooses to treat @xmath102 as a known metric which is moreover not the physical metric but rather only conformally - related to it by _",
    "ij = ^h_ij .",
    "we work in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and permit @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath34 to conformally transform according to ^ij = ^- 2k^ij , ^i = ^ , = ^ , whilst crucially demanding the constant mean curvature ( cmc ) condition k = holds and is conformally - invariant .",
    "one then demands that the ( raised ) codazzi constraint ( [ acod ] ) is to be conformally - invariant . since _",

    "now , regardless of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) , provided that the ( @xmath10 + 1)-dimensional dec is to be preserved by the conformal transformation , @xmath113 must conformally - transform like @xmath114 , implying @xmath115 . then ( [ prolich ] ) becomes the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) version of the lichnerowicz equation d^2= - ( -r - m^-4 + ^2^ - 2 ^ -2 ) [ ndlich ] for the conformal factor @xmath116 .",
    "we observe that a number of the very attractive features of the york method are ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4)-independent . first , it decouples the solution of the codazzi constraint from the solution of the gauss constraint .",
    "the former proceeds by a traceless - transverse ( tt)traceless - longitudinal ( tl ) splitting @xcite k^ij = k^ij + k^ij , d_ik^ij 0 , k^ij = 2(d^(iw^j ) - h^ijd_cw^c ) ( for some vector potential @xmath117 ) , which along with the trace - tracefree split is conformally - invariant and thus unaffected by the solution of the latter , which has become the p.d.e ( [ ndlich ] ) for the conformal factor .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath118 , @xmath119 which at most requires solution of a first - order linear equation .",
    "second , the choice in using the scale - scalefree decomposition of the metric and the trace - tracefree and tt  tl decompositions of @xmath89 are all decompositions into irreducibles and thus @xmath10-dimensionally generally - covariant choices , a decided advantage over the magaard method .",
    "third , one can attempt to preserve the cmc condition away from the ` initial ' hypersurface @xmath11 , which can be done provided that the equation d^2 + ( k^2 - r - ) = can be solved for the lapse @xmath120 .",
    "this choice of lapse is the cmc slicing gauge .",
    "this deliberately defocusses geodesics , thus by definition preventing the breakdown of the coordinate system due to caustic formation @xcite , and so enhancing the practical longevity of the evolution . however , york s method is not absolutely general , for some spacetimes have no cmc slice to identify with @xmath11 in the first place , and in others the cmc slicing can not be maintained to cover the whole spacetime .",
    "furthermore , these results depend on the asymptotics assumed . however , in the usual ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) case , this method ( and its variants ) is widely accepted as a practical method by the numerical relativity community , for example in the study of colliding compact astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "of importance for the viability of this method in this application , recent evidence suggests that problems involving gravity wave emission can be treated thus @xcite .",
    "however , some of the other attractive features used to gain control in the york method are only known to occur for the @xmath7 case and have mainly been studied in depth for the compact without boundary and asymptotically - flat cases of ( 3 , 0 ) data construction .",
    "first , the study of the usual ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) lichnerowicz equation has been based on its ellipticity ( and elliptic methods are absolutely not generalizable to the ` hyperbolic ' equations ) .",
    "the ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) lichnerowicz equation is well - studied , including with most fundamental matter fields @xcite , and for sobolev spaces matching those then used in the gr cp @xcite .",
    "second , the study of the cmc slicing equation has been based on its ellipticity , so the theory of existence of cmc slicings @xcite is likely to be signature - dependent .",
    "third , the method depends on the asymptotics used and has only been studied in the ( 3 , 0 ) compact without boundary @xcite and asymptotically flat @xcite cases .",
    "fourth , for @xmath7 there is the useful property that certain local data patches can be proved to suffice for the treatment of an astrophysical problem , by building on the notion of dod .",
    "as mentioned , this sort of technique is also applicable to protect pieces of local data obtained by magaard s method on a ( @xmath1 , 0 ) hypersurface .",
    "investigation of whether the @xmath9 ` wave lichnerowicz equation ' has good existence and uniqueness properties could be interesting .",
    "the natural setting for this is as a cauchy problem ( for even the 2-dimensional wave equation is ill - posed as a dirichlet problem ) . assuming that there exists a cauchy surface in the ( 3 , 1 ) spacetime sense , one can attempt forward and backward evolution to produce a global data set ( assuming also that the decoupled procedure for finding @xmath121 also yields a global solution ) .",
    "one must remember however that the next stage is still to be a sideways cauchy problem . whilst this suggested procedure for the data could conceivably produce global data sets in some subcases and thus avoid the information leak problem , the other difficulties we described in sec 2.4 remain . therefore in our view",
    "the ` wave lichnerowicz equation ' is unlikely to be suitable as a general method .",
    "we favour instead the ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) approach in sec 6 . that said , the ` wave lichnerowicz equation ' may still serve as the basis of a useful heuristic method .",
    "we consider this in sec 4.7 .",
    "we finally discuss the thin sandwich method and why we do not provide an ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) hamiltonian formulation .    in gr",
    "the lapse may be _ algebraically eliminated from the action by use of its own variational equation to form a reduced baierlein  sharp ",
    "wheeler action @xcite .",
    "suppose that ( @xmath102 , @xmath122 ) is prescribed on a hypersurface along with @xmath34 and @xmath123 .",
    "the thin sandwich conjecture @xcite is that in reasonably general circumstances there exists a unique solution to solving the variational equation for the shift ( this equation replaces the codazzi constraint ) , as a differential equation for the shift itself .",
    "once this is done , the lapse may be reconstructed from the equation used to eliminate it , and the extrinsic curvature then follows from its definition .",
    "the lapse may then be reconstructed from the equation used to eliminate it , and the extrinsic curvature then follows from its definition ( [ ecd ] ) . _    we note that this procedure is ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4)-independent .",
    "thus we pose the conjecture for general ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is also considered for thin matter sheets in sec 4.7 .",
    "to date we are only aware of ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) papers @xcite treating this conjecture , which contain some favourable and unfavourable results obtained mostly by use of elliptic methods . in fact , there are two variants of the conjecture : i ) the thick sandwich conjecture in which lower - dimensional metrics are prescribed on two nearby hypersurfaces .",
    "ii ) the thin sandwich conjecture proper , as stated above .    a ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) hamiltonian formulation is not provided because although it is insensitive to @xmath4 @xcite , it is sensitive to @xmath2 through the intimate involvement of the space of geometries . whilst the usual hamiltonian formulation is based on the space of riemannian geometries ( superspace ) @xcite ,",
    "the space of semi - riemannian geometries is reported to be not even hausdorff @xcite .",
    "first , we present a simple instance common in the higher - dimensional literature to which sec 2.1 - 3 is applicable . the _ warpfactor split @xcite g_cd = ( _    ll ^2(x^ , z ) & 0 + 0 & w(x^ , z)f_(x^ )    ) , w(x^ , 0 ) = 1 [ wan ] is a simple subcase of the @xmath23-dynamics scheme , in which the metric is allowed to @xmath23-evolve only in its scale , away from the @xmath124 hypersurface where it is taken to be known .",
    "then ( [ ecd ] ) leads to @xmath125 which gives the equation = - [ wftr ] for the warpfactor .",
    "for example , using the ansatz @xmath126 in ( [ wftr ] ) gives an exponential randall  sundrum type warpfactor .",
    "whereas the split ( [ wan ] ) does not cover very many cases , our scheme exhibits generalizations for it : to permit the whole metric to evolve and to recognize the gauge freedom in @xmath127 , which should ideally be used to separate coordinate effects from true physics in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "full , overtly @xmath23-dynamical schemes are used in particular examples for domain walls @xcite , braneworld black holes ( such as for the pancake or cigar bulk horizon shape problem @xcite ) and for braneworld stars @xcite .",
    "whereas in the randall  sundrum model the higher and lower - dimensional cosmological constants balance out leaving vacuum ( minkowski ) on the brane , more generally a brane would consist of a thin sheet of matter  a junction .",
    "we study such [ shiromizu  maeda  sasaki ( sms)-type ] braneworlds below , starting first however with a careful recollection of where the underlying israel junction conditions come from .",
    "assume that we have a ( @xmath0  1)-dimensional thin matter sheet in a @xmath0-dimensional bulk .",
    "in all cases considered , the bulk s extra dimension is spatial ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "our discussion follows @xcite most closely whilst keeping the unraised index positions of israel s original work @xcite .    whereas the requirement of well - defined geometry dictates that the metric is continuous across the thin matter sheet yielding the junction condition ( j.c ) ^+_- f_^+ - f_^- = 0 , [ jcf ]",
    "discontinuities in certain derivatives of the metric are permissible .",
    "consider then the 3 projections of the einstein tensor @xmath128 .",
    "we use the @xmath5 cases of the codazzi and gauss constraints ( [ cod ] ) and ( [ gauss ] ) for @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the following construction is used .",
    "one begins by writing down the contracted gauss equation ( [ contg ] ) and subtracts off @xmath132 times the doubly - contracted gauss equation ([gpp ] ) :    c r _ + - f _    c - + +    c r _",

    "step 2 : the contracted ricci equation ( [ tpcont ] ) is used to remove all the @xmath55 .",
    "thus (    c r _ + - f _    )    c - + +    c + f _    = (    c r _ + -f _    )    c - + +    c k k _ + k _",

    "they begin by forming the ( 3 , 1)-dimensional einstein tensor @xmath140 just like we obtain ( [ bfbwefes ] ) above .",
    "sms then apply three steps to this equation .",
    "step s1 : using the definition of the weyl tensor , @xmath141 is replaced by the electric part of the weyl tensor , @xmath142 and extra terms built from the projections of @xmath143 .",
    "step s2 ( = step 3 of the above subsection ) : the ( 4 , 1)-dimensional efe s are then assumed , which permits one to exchange all remaining projections of @xmath143 for ( 4 , 1)-dimensional energy - momentum terms .",
    "only when this is carried out does ( [ bfbwefes ] ) become a system of field equations rather than of geometrical identities .",
    "we refer to the field equations at this stage as `` timelike hypersurface efe s '' ( thefe s ) , as opposed to the braneworld efe s which arise at the next stage .",
    "step s3 : a special subcase of thefe s are braneworld efe s ( befe s ) , which are obtained in normal coordinates by choosing the ( thin ) braneworld energy - momentum tensor ansatz    _",
    "ab = y_ab(z ) - g_ab , _ ab ( t_ab - f_ab ) , t_abz^a = 0 , [ bwem ] where @xmath144 is the energy - momentum of the matter confined to the brane .",
    "this is a specialization due to the specific presence of ( 3 , 1 ) and ( 4 , 1 ) cosmological constants @xmath33 and @xmath145 , and by @xmath145 being the only bulk contribution .",
    "a more precise formulation of this , and generalizations , are the subject of sec 4.5 .",
    "one then adopts the j.cs ( [ jcf ] ) , ( [ jc0 ] ) , and ( [ prez2 ] ) with the additional supposition of @xmath146 symmetry : - k _ _",
    "^+ = - k_^- _ = - ( y _ - f _ ) = - ( t _ - f _ ) , [ 41jc ] where the 5-dimensional gravitational constant @xmath147 has been made explicit .",

    "although it also contains 15 equations , the sms befe  gauss  codazzi system is not equivalent to the ( 4 , 1)-dimensional efe s : indeed sms write down further third - order equations for the `` evolution '' away from the timelike brane of @xmath151 , by use of the @xmath23-derivative of the contracted gauss equation ( [ contg ] ) , bianchi identities and the ricci equation ( [ thirdproj ] ) .",
    "this then involves the magnetic part of the weyl tensor @xmath152 , the  evolution \" of which follows from further bianchi identities .",
    "this full brane - bulk sms system is then closed .",
    "step 4 : in practice , however , instead of the difficult treatment of this third - order system , other practitioners have often worked on the sms befe s alone .",
    "this involves either the ad hoc prescription of the functional form of @xmath151 ( sometimes taken to be zero ) .",
    "in fact it is often first decomposed according to a standard procedure @xcite .",
    "because the original functional form is unknown , the functional forms of each of the parts defined by the decomposition is also unknown .",
    "some of these parts are set equal to zero whereas other parts are taken to have other functional forms ( in particular a radiation fluid term ) .",
    "these terms are then argued to be small in the circumstances arising in the inflationary @xcite and perturbative @xcite treatments .",
    "however other interpretations may be possible .",
    "having dealt with @xmath151 in one of the above ways , the form ( 53 ) of @xmath153 is then often taken to be uniquely defined and the starting - point of many works on brane cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , sms s procedure is far from unique .",
    "it turns out that there are many reformulations of the befe arising from geometrical identities .",
    "each has a distinct split of the non - einsteinian befe terms into ` bulk ' and ` brane ' terms .",
    "whereas all these formulations are clearly equivalent , their use helps clarify how to interpret sms s braneworld .",
    "were one to truncate the ` bulk ' terms in each case ( in direct analogy with the usual practice of throwing away the weyl term ) , then the befe s obtained in each case would generally be inequivalent .      the weyl term in sms s befe s has been the subject of much mystery .",
    "how should it be interpreted ?",
    "is it right to throw it away and if so under which circumstances ? we emphasize that our stance is broader than merely about what functional form is allocated to the weyl term ( e.g whether it is zero everywhere ) .",
    "it is about how formulations can be chosen in which the befe s are not explicitly formulated in terms of a weyl term .",
    "we first remove some misconceptions as to how sms s procedure leads to a befe containing a weyl term .",
    "does it have anything to do with the modelling of braneworld scenarios ?",
    "no , for the weyl term is already in the sms thefe before the braneworld energy - momentum ansatz is invoked .",
    "furthermore , all the procedures used in sms s method are independent of signature and dimension .",
    "thus this issue of a weyl term must have already arisen long ago in the study of the gr cp .",
    "so why is there no manifest weyl term piece in the gr cp formulation of the efe s ?",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "indeed , we have already seen the answer in sec 4.1 since it is fundamentally tied to how the crucial junction condition ( [ prez2 ] ) is obtained in the first place!. in the `` gr cp '' and israel procedures , _ one uses the ricci equation ( [ thirdproj ] ) to remove the @xmath154 term . if there is no early use of the ricci equation , one is left with @xmath151 in the thefe s , which requires later use of the ricci equation to `` evolve '' it .",
    "_    so there is a choice as to whether one formulates the befe s with or without an explicit weyl term . in the usual treatment of the split of the efe s (",
    "sec 2.2 ) , one does not use an explicit weyl term . in the ( 4 , 1)-d case ,",
    "this gives a well - understood system of 15 p.d.es in the variables @xmath155 .",
    "the option of using an explicit weyl term gives a considerably larger , more complicated system of p.d.es with variables @xmath155 , @xmath151 and @xmath156 .",
    "in fact a similar scheme known as the _ threading formulation @xcite is sometimes used in the usual ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) application . the idea behind",
    "this formulation is to treat as primary the geodesic congruences perpendicular to the foliation rather than the foliation itself .",
    "one then uses only that information on the hypersurfaces that arrives along the impinging geodesic congruence , on the grounds that this is the physically - significant information .",
    "thus it is a ` deliberately incomplete system ' from the foliation perspective . whereas this and the sms formulation are similar in their use of weyl variables",
    ", the sms system does not appear to be a threading formulation .",
    "also , in any case the idea of having a deliberately partial system in the threading formulation is clearly tied to signature - specific physical reasons which do not carry over to the signature relevant to sms s equations .",
    "we also note that some other third - order reformulations of the @xmath157 split of the efe s are sometimes used to seek to cast the efe s into hyperbolic forms that manifestly have theorems associated with them @xcite .",
    "whereas this is precisely the sort of result that is spoiled by considering instead a sideways split , it serves to illustrate that what at first seems a ` mere reformulation ' of a set of equations can in fact be used to prove highly nontrivial theorems .",
    "so , whereas similar complicated formulations have been used elsewhere in the gr literature , sms s unstated motivation to have a complicated formulation does not coincide with the motivation elsewhere in the literature .",
    "below we bring attention to many reformulations of sms s system , so we ask : what is the motivation for the original sms formulation ?",
    "should the use of some simpler second - order formulation be preferred ? is sms s formulation or any other third- or second - order formulation singled out by good behaviour , either in general or for some particular application ? _    also , from first principles the sms procedure to obtain their befe is quite complicated . for",
    ", since they use the j.c obtained by the israel procedure , their procedure actually entails beginning with the whole israel procedure ( steps 1 to 3 of sec 4.1 ) , and then choosing to reintroduce @xmath158 and @xmath55 by reverse application of steps 1 and 2 .",
    "this is followed by the weyl rearrangement ( step s1 ) , the use of the efe s ( step s2 ) and the substitution of the j.c into the extrinsic curvature terms in the braneworld ansatz ( step s3 ) . however , despite being complicated , all is well with sms s scheme since any befe s obtained by other such combinations of careful procedures will always be equivalent because the different steps are related by geometrical identities .",
    "step 4 however is not an instance of being careful as it is a truncation .",
    "our first point is that whereas in sms s formulation the non - einsteinian terms in the befe might be regarded as a bulk - like @xmath151 and a term quadratic in the brane energy - momentum , in other formulations the content of these two terms can be mixed up . in general , befe s contain a group of non - einsteinian ` bulk ' terms we denote by @xmath159 ( which include both weyl terms and normal derivatives of objects such as the extrinsic curvature ) , and a group of non - einsteinian ` brane ' terms that depend on the brane energy - momentum .",
    "thus any temptation to discard the weyl term in the sms formulation ( on the grounds that it involves the unknown bulk over which one has no control ) should be seen in the light that if one considered instead a reformulation , then there would be a similar temptation to discard the corresponding ` bulk ' term , which would generally lead to something _ other than the weyl term being discarded .",
    "thus for each formulation , the corresponding truncation of the ` bulk term ' would result in inequivalent residual ` braneworld physics ' .",
    "this is because there are geometrical identities that relate ` bulk ' and ` brane ' terms , so that the splits mentioned above are highly non - unique and thus not true splits at all .",
    "we take this as a clear indication that any such truncations should be avoided in general . instead",
    ", the full system must be studied . _",
    "our second point is that each possible bulk spacetime may contain some hypersurface on which a given @xmath159 vanishes . then if one identifies this hypersurface with the position of the brane , one has a solution of the full brane - bulk system and not a truncation .",
    "for example , in any conformally - flat bulk , by definition @xmath160 and therefore @xmath161 on all hypersurfaces . thus any of these could be identified as a brane to form a genuine ( rather than truncated ) @xmath162 braneworld . from this",
    ", we can see that _ the sms formulation is particularly well adapted for the study of conformally - flat bulks such as pure ads .",
    "this motivates sms s formulation as regards this common application .",
    "however , also consider repeating the above procedure with some @xmath163 .",
    "this would correspond to a genuine ( rather than truncated ) braneworld model with distinct braneworld physics from that given by sms s particular quadratic term .",
    "note that given a model with some @xmath164 , the befe formulation for which @xmath159 is the bulk term is particularly well adapted for the study of that model .",
    "thus different formulations may facilitate the study of braneworlds with different braneworld physics . in the context of conformally - flat spacetimes",
    ", it is probably true that the @xmath162 braneworlds outnumber the braneworlds for which any other ( or even all other ) @xmath164 since these other conditions are not automatically satisfied on all embedded hypersurfaces .",
    "rather , each of these other conditions constitutes a difficult geometrical problem , somewhat reminiscent of the question of which spacetimes contain a maximal ( k = 0 ) or cmc slice @xcite",
    ". however , generic spacetimes are not conformally - flat . for a generic spacetime , we see no difference between the status of the condition ` @xmath162 on some hypersurface ' and the condition ` any other particular @xmath164 on some hypersurface ' . because braneworlds constructed in each of these cases have a different residual quadratic term and thus a propensity to have distinct braneworld physics , and because we do not know how frequently each of these cases occur , we question whether anything inferred from conformally - flat models with the sms quadratic term need be typical of the full sms brane - bulk system .",
    "confirmation of this would require study of the full range of difficult geometrical problems @xmath164 , and the construction of concrete examples of non - sms quadratic term braneworld models together with the assessment of whether their braneworld physics is conceptually and observationally acceptable . _    for the moment we study what is the available range of reformulations and thus of @xmath159 . to convince the reader that such reformulations exist , we provide a first example before listing all the steps which are available for reformulating the befe s .",
    "assume we do not perform all the steps implicit within sms s work but rather just the israel steps to obtain the j.c and then use it in the field equation ( [ israel ] ) that gave rise to it ( as done in @xcite ) , or ( as done below ) use it in the `` gr cp '' field equation following from ( [ grcpid ] ) . in other words , why not apply the braneworld ansatz to e.g the israel or `` gr cp '' formulations rather than to the sms formulation ?",
    "in the `` gr cp '' case we then obtain g _",
    "= l _ + q _ + b _ [ cpbefe ] q _ = - [ qcp ] l _ = ( t - 2 ^ 2 ) f _ + _ 5 ^ 2[t _ - ( + ) f _ ] [ lcp ] b _ = f _ - . [ bcp ]",
    "this example serves to illustrate that choosing to use a different formulation can cause the ` brane ' quadratic term @xmath148 to be different .",
    "also note that this formulation makes no explicit use of the weyl term .",
    "thus this befe , along with the gauss and codazzi constraints , forms a small second - order system , in contrast with the much larger third - order sms system .",
    "now we further study the list of steps @xcite which may be applied in the construction of befe s .",
    "steps s1 and 3 together mean that the weyl ` bulk ' term @xmath151 is equivalent to the riemann ` bulk ' term together with matter terms .",
    "this swap by itself involves no terms which are quadratic in the extrinsic curvature .",
    "step 1 says that the riemann ` bulk ' term is equivalent to the hypersurface derivative of the extrinsic curvature together with a @xmath165 term .",
    "steps s1 and 3 together say that the hypersurface derivative of the trace of the extrinsic curvature is equivalent to a matter term together with a @xmath166 term .",
    "furthermore , one can use both steps 2 - 3 and step 1 , on arbitrary proportions ( parametrized by @xmath108 and @xmath167 ) of @xmath168 and of @xmath55 :    ll g _ &",
    "= g _ - ( 1 + ) r_+ ( 1 - ) r_f _ + + & + k k _ + ( - 1 ) k_^ k _ - f _ + ( - ) k f _    [ 2param ] this introduces freedom in the coefficients of the @xmath165 and @xmath166 contributions to the quadratic term @xmath169 in the thefe s .",
    "we next find further freedom in @xmath170 by choice of the objects to be regarded as primary .",
    "we are free to choose a ` bulk ' term described by hypersurface derivatives @xmath171 ( which are partial derivatives @xmath136 in normal coordinates ) of objects related to the extrinsic curvature @xmath172 by use of the metric tensor ( including its inverse and determinant @xmath173 ) .",
    "the underlying reason for doing this is that it is just as natural to treat such an object , rather than the extrinsic curvature itself , as primary ( see below for examples ) .    upon careful consideration ,",
    "there are three separate ways such objects can be related to the extrinsic curvature : raising indices , removing a portion of the trace by defining @xmath174 , and densitizing by defining @xmath175 .",
    "the hypersurface derivatives of these objects are related to those of the extrinsic curvature by _",
    "k _ = _ ( f_k^ _ ) = f _ _ k^ _ - 2_k^ _ , [ i ] _ k _ = _ k^ _ + ( _ kf _ - 2 _ ) , [ 64 ] _ k _ = ( f)^-_1_(f^_1k _ ) + 2_1kk_. [ 65 ] further useful equations arise from the traces of these : _ k = f^ _ k _ + 2 , [ 63 ] _",
    "k = [ f^ _ _ _ - 2(k^2 - k ) ] , [ new ] _ k = ( f)^-_2_(f^_2k ) + 2_2k^2 , [ 66 ] where the @xmath176 in ( [ new ] ) and ( [ new ] ) has been obtained via ( [ 66 ] ) .",
    "the following examples of @xmath177 illustrate that the use of such objects is entirely natural : @xmath178 is the @xmath121 commonly used in the ivp literature , and @xmath179 appears in the guise of forming the complete normal derivative in the israel procedure .",
    "also , the `` gravitational momenta '' are @xmath180 .",
    "the above thorough consideration of possible ` bulk ' terms permits all four thefe terms homogeneously quadratic in the extrinsic curvature to be changed independently",
    ". one may think that we have a redundancy in providing 8 ways to change only 4 coefficients .",
    "however , one can afford then to lose some of the freedoms by making extra demands , of which we now provide four examples of relevance to this paper .",
    "first , one could further demand that there is no weyl term in the thefe s ( as discussed in sec .",
    "second , unequal densitization of @xmath172 and @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) corresponds to interpreting the fundamental variable to be some densitization of the metric rather than the metric itself .",
    "whereas this is again a common practice ( for example the scale - free metric of the ivp literature is @xmath183 in dimension @xmath10 ) , the use of such an object as fundamental variable does appear to complicate the isolation of the ( 3 , 1 ) einstein tensor truly corresponding to this fundamental variable .",
    "thus this option is not pursued in this paper .",
    "third , one may start by declaring that one is to use particular well - known primary objects ( such as the `` gravitational momenta '' ) and still desire to be left with much freedom of formulation .",
    "fourth , one could declare that one is to use the raised objects given by ( [ 63 ] ) , in which case the further ability to change coefficients by use of ( [ 64 ] ) is lost , since moving a kronecker delta rather than a metric through the derivative clearly generates no terms quadratic in the extrinsic curvature .      as a consequence of the above freedoms , there are many formulations in which all four coefficients vanish , and hence @xmath184 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath148 is zero [ and it is easy to show that all instances of @xmath185 follow from @xmath184 ] .",
    "thus it suffices to seek for cases of thefe s with @xmath184 to obtain all cases of befe formulations that have no quadratic term .",
    "we now motivate these formulations and then choose to exhibit three that comply with some of the extra demands in the previous paragraph .",
    "the diversity of ` brane'-`bulk ' splits ensures that truncations such as step 4 produce all possible combinations of quadratic terms as residual ` braneworld physics ' .",
    "alternatively , one may suspect that there might be solutions to the full brane - bulk system that just happen to have a particular @xmath164 on some hypersurface which is then identified as a brane .",
    "we speculate that each of these situations will often lead to different answers to questions of physical interest . whereas most friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) perfect fluid models with    equation of state @xmath187 arising thus will be similar , differences will be more salient in models with more complicated equations of state , in perturbations about flrw ( as started in @xcite in the sms - adapted case ) and in anisotropic models ( as started by @xcite in the sms - adapted case ) .",
    "these in turn constitute natural frameworks to seriously justify the late - time emergence of flrw behaviour and the likelihood of inflation @xcite as well as the study of singularities @xcite on the brane .",
    "we emphasize that , for a satisfactory study of whether any particular full brane - bulk ( as opposed to truncated ) case leads to any differences from the hitherto - studied @xmath162 case , one would require a full brane - bulk solution explicitly constructed to satisfy some @xmath164 on some hypersurface within a particular given bulk spacetime .",
    "since we currently have no such example , our arguments currently only support the far simpler idea that truncation should be avoided .",
    "we illustrate that in different formulations , the truncation of the corresponding ` bulk ' terms can lead to big differences in the residual ` braneworld physics ' , without any of the above lengthy calculations .",
    "we do this by formulating the ` bulk ' part so that there is no corresponding @xmath188 term at all .",
    "thus these truncations give the ` @xmath34 ' of standard flrw cosmology rather than the ` @xmath34 and @xmath113 ' of brane cosmology @xcite . as a result whether we have a ` @xmath34 and @xmath113 ' brane cosmology depends on the choice of formulation .",
    "so we argue that since the sms procedure followed by truncating the weyl term is a hitherto unaccounted - for choice out of many possible procedures , then adopting the particular homogeneous quadratic term of sms ( often taken as the starting - point of brane cosmology ) appears to be unjustified .",
    "rather , we conclude that no particular truncation should be privileged as the act of truncation imprints undesirable arbitrariness into the study of the truncated system . whereas the ( 3 , 1)-dimensional trace of @xmath151 happens to be zero ( including use of antisymmetry ) and",
    "thus might phenomenologically look like pure radiation fluid to observers on the brane , other bulk characterizations would typically not look like a pure radiative fluid .",
    "this may open up phenomenological possibilities .    also , before further study of sms s",
    "full ( untruncated , third - order ) system is undertaken , some of the reformulations along the lines suggested in sec 4.4 might turn out to be more tractable .",
    "in particular those reformulations which fully eliminate @xmath168 by the early use of the ricci equation are already closed as second - order systems .",
    "these include the israel formulation in @xcite , the `` gr cp '' formulation ( [ cpbefe][bcp ] ) , and our second and third examples below , which contain neither a weyl term nor a quadratic term .    for our first example , we take as the primary object the antidensitized extrinsic curvature @xmath189 so that the ` bulk ' term is ( partly ) a combination of this object s normal derivatives . the corresponding befe s are : g _ = l _ + b _ l _ = + ( 5 t _ - t)f _ , b _ = -2e _ + ( - f^ f _ ) ( where we have chosen to remove all projections of @xmath143 by the efe s ) .    to derive this ,",
    "take ( [ 2param ] ) in normal coordinates .",
    "choose to convert all of the @xmath190 into @xmath191 by ( [ 63 ] ) :    ll g _ & = g _ - ( 1 + ) r _ + ( 1 - ) r_f _ + ( + f _ ) + & + k k _ + ( - 1 ) k_^ k _ - f _ + ( + ) k f _    now choosing the primary object to be some densitized @xmath192 by ( [ 65 ] ) we have    ll g _ = & g _ - ( 1 + ) r _ + ( 1 - ) r _ f _ + ( + f^ ) + & + ( 1 + 2)kk _ +",
    "( - 1 ) k_^ k _",
    "+ ( 2- ) k^2f _ + ( + ) k f _ ,",
    "so clearly @xmath193 , @xmath194 and the antidensitization choice of weighting @xmath195 ensure that @xmath184    the following examples arose from asking if it is possible to find examples in which neither @xmath148 nor @xmath151 feature .",
    "we found the following befe s : g _ = l _ + b _ l _",
    "= t _ + ( t_- ) f _ , b _",
    "= ( f _ - f _ ) by considering as our primary object the densitized extrinsic curvature with one index raised , @xmath196 .",
    "we obtained these befe s by arguing as follows . in order for the befe s to contain no weyl term ,",
    "@xmath167 is fixed    to be @xmath197 .",
    "then the only control over @xmath165 is from raising by ( [ i ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that this raising must be applied to the whole @xmath198 in order for the coefficient of @xmath165 to be zero .",
    "then using @xmath199 does not change any terms quadratic in the extrinsic curvature .",
    "also , use of distinct densities for @xmath181 and @xmath200 does not appear to make sense since both quantities are related to @xmath172 by a single use of the inverse metric .",
    "although all these restrictions make the outcome unlikely , the use of ( [ 65 ] ) and ( [ 66 ] ) alone suffices to obtain the above example :    ll g _ & = g _ + ( 1 - ) r_f _ + f^- ( - + f _ ) + & + ( 1 -2 ) k k _ + ( 2- ) k^2f _ + ( - ) k f _    which has no quadratic terms if @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( ` densitization ' weight ) .",
    "another possibility is to replace @xmath203 by @xmath204 .",
    "although this does not immediately do anything about the quadratic terms , if we also convert a portion @xmath205 of @xmath206 into @xmath207 we obtain    ll g _ & = g _ + ( 1 - ) r_f _ + f^- ( - + ( - ) f _ ) + & + ( 1 -2 ) k k _ + ^2f _ + f _ ,    which requires @xmath208 , whereupon the two remaining equations become identical : @xmath209 , which clearly has many solutions .",
    "a particularly neat one is to take @xmath210 so that the primary objects are ` gravitational momenta ' and @xmath211 so that only two normal derivative terms appear in the ` bulk ' term .",
    "then @xmath212 so the befe s read g _",
    "= l _ + b _ , l _ = t _ + f _ , b _ = ( f _ - f^ f _ ) .    of course , it would make sense to particularly investigate the difficult geometrical problem ` @xmath164 on some embedded hypersurface ' for such @xmath164 corresponding to no quadratic terms , since by the same arguments as above , such a model would be sure to give braneworld physics distinguishable from that hitherto studied .",
    "first , so far we have talked in terms of the @xmath213 split of the matter contribution to relate our work as clearly as possible to its predecessors in the literature . however , from the outset @xcite it was pointed out that this split is not unique . on these grounds",
    "we would prefer to work with the unique trace - tracefree split in which all the @xmath214 contributes to the trace part .",
    "the ( 4 , 0 ) version of this split is used in sec 6 .",
    "second , given a fixed type of bulk energy - momentum such as the @xmath56 of nkk or the @xmath215 , then establishing an embedding requires the existence of a suitable compensatory characterization of the bulk geometry .",
    "the gr line of thought would be to only take results within such schemes seriously if they are robust to the addition of bulk matter fields .",
    "of course privileged choices of bulk could arise from further theoretical input .",
    "we argue below that the theoretical arguments behind some privileged choices in the literature for the bulk energy - momentum are not convincing enough to anchor strongly credible physical predictions .",
    "one would rather require rigorous and general theoretical input following directly from some fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "the vacuum choice of bulk of the induced matter nkk approach is always possible    given the premises of the cm result .",
    "then @xmath216 is claimed to be a complete geometrization of matter @xcite .",
    "however , the cm result holds equally well for any other analytical functional form of the energy - momentum .",
    "furthermore , this approach considers only 1-component ( ` induced ' ) matter ; counting degrees of freedom shows that it can not be extended to many important cases of fundamental matter . whereas allowing for more extra dimensions could improve similar situations @xcite , unification requires geometrization of the fundamental matter laws themselves , whilst this ` induced matter ' approach only geometrizes solutions of the efe s coupled to matter of unspecified field dependence .",
    "the @xmath215 choice of bulk ( an example of which is pure ads ) is clearly also always possible given the premises of a particular case of the generalized cm result .",
    "however , the motivation we wish to discuss is the argument for pure ads bulks from string theory .",
    "this is not generally justifiable since firstly , bulk gravitons are permitted so the bulk geometry would generically contain gravity waves .",
    "secondly , bulk scalars ought to be permitted since they occur along with the graviton in the closed string spectrum @xcite .",
    "the content of the closed string spectrum thus places interesting restrictions on bulk matter rather than completely abolishing it . from the perspective of 5d gr , evidence for the stability of vacuum or ads bulks ( and of any resulting physical predictions ) to the introduction of suitable bulk fields would constitute important necessary support for such models and their predictions .    finally note that use of arbitrary smooth bulk @xmath57 does not affect the form of the junction conditions since only the thin matter sheet contribution to @xmath57 enters these .",
    "the conclusion of our second point is that there is no good reason not to explore at least certain kinds of bulk matter in order to have a more general feel for how these thin matter sheet models behave @xcite .",
    "first we explain how our criticism of ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) methods in general in sec 2.4 are applicable to the case with thin matter sheets .",
    "as regards the  evolution \" w.r.t @xmath23 , the issue of causality holds regardless of whether thin matter sheets are present , and the issue of well - posedness not being known will become particularly relevant in the study of sufficiently general situations in which rough function spaces would become necessary to describe the evolution of thin matter sheets ( see sec 6.1 ) .",
    "the campbell  magaard scheme is of limited use in models with thin matter sheets not only because analytic functions are undesirable ( and definitely inapplicable to sufficiently general situations ) but also because the junction condition imposes restrictions on @xmath172 which prevents these being subdivided into the knowns and unknowns of magaard s method .",
    "these restrictions remain even if one considers suitably well - behaved thick matter sheet models . in the next paragraph",
    "we outline how much we expect can be achieved with the ( 3 , 1 ) version of the york method applied on the thin matter sheet , but recall that even if this does provide data sets , one is next confronted with the difficulties of the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 )  evolution \" scheme .",
    "the main message is that the choice of methods which properly respect the difference between space and time is absolutely crucial .",
    "thus , although at the simplest level ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) methods which build higher - dimensional bulks about the privileged ( 3 , 1 ) worlds may look tempting , general attempts at proceeding thus are hampered by the required mathematical tools simply not being available and by these attempts not being in accord with the usual notion of causality .    to date ( 4 , 1 )",
    "worlds built from ( 3 , 1 ) ones have relied on very simple specialized anstze , such as    \\a ) @xmath23-symmetric surfaces @xmath217 with known metric @xmath155 , whereupon the vacuum codazzi equation is automatically satisfied and then @xmath218 is required from the gauss constraint .",
    "\\b ) @xmath126 with known @xmath155 , for example to obtain the randall  sundrum bulk @xcite or slightly more general solutions @xcite .",
    "now the maximal subcase @xmath219 of the cmc condition is a generalization of a ) , whereas the full cmc condition itself is a generalization of b ) .",
    "moreover , now the metric is to be treated as only known up to scale . thus one would generally only know",
    "the full metric of each model s ( 3 , 1 ) world once the ` wave lichnerowicz equation ' for the embedding of this world into the ( 4 , 1 ) world is solved .",
    "so one loses the hold from the outset on whether each model will turn out to contain an interesting ( 3 , 1 ) world .",
    "nevertheless , some of the ( 3 , 1 ) worlds will turn out to be of interest .",
    "furthermore , one should question the sensibleness of any ideas involving the prescription of full ( 3 , 1 ) metrics if the most general technique available fails to respect such a prescription .",
    "this point is more significant for ( 3 , 1 ) data than for ( 3 , 0 ) data because conformally - related metrics have different non - null geodesics . for ( 3 , 0 ) data no physical significance",
    "is attached to spatial geodesics , but for ( 3 , 1 ) there are timelike geodesics which are physically interpreted as paths of free motion of massive particles .",
    "so a @xmath220 spacetime which is conformally related to @xmath221 is different physically ( for example one could violate energy conditions the other one does not violate ) .",
    "one can get out of this problem by either attaching no physical significance to one s inspired guesses for @xmath221 or by hoping for unobservably tiny deviations between the geodesic curves of the two geometries .",
    "in the specific case of thin matter sheets , by the j.cs , a ) implies that @xmath222 , whilst b ) implies that @xmath223 is a hypersurface constant .",
    "the maximal condition implies that @xmath224 whilst the cmc one implies that @xmath223 is a hypersurface constant .",
    "so whereas the maximal and cmc ans@xmath225tze are more general than a ) and b ) respectively , they are nevertheless restricted in this braneworld application .",
    "notice , however , that a number of interesting cases are included : vacuum , radiative matter and electromagnetic matter are all among the @xmath224 spacetimes .",
    "it is important to note that unlike the usual gr application , the choice of a hypersurface to be a brane is not a choice of slicing because localized energy ",
    "momentum is to be pinned on it .",
    "almost all reslicings would fail to isolate this energy - momentum on a single slice .",
    "we know of no good reason why the brane should be cmc nor what value the cmc should take on it",
    ". however , at least this is a well - defined notion and it is substantially simpler to solve for than in general because of the decoupling of the gauss and codazzi constraints .    as regards possible use of either of the two forms of the thin sandwich conjecture to treat branes , we first distinguish between thin sandwiches between 2 nearby branes and thin sandwiches which have a brane on one side and an undistinguished hypersurface on the other",
    ". one should be aware that non - intersection requirements may be different in these two cases , and also different from that of the original tsc setting of 2 unprivileged spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "second , one would have to take @xmath226 as unknown until it can be deduced from the @xmath172 evaluated from the ts procedure .",
    "finally we caution that tsc schemes need not always exist .",
    "they require the `` lapse '' to be algebraically - eliminable , which for example is not the case for the analogous @xmath22 of the kk split .",
    "we have argued in secs 2 - 3 in favour of ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) schemes over ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes .",
    "however , it is often suggested that ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes may be useful since in certain particular examples ( 3 , 1 ) spacetime singularities are ` removed ' by embedding into nonsingular ( 4 , 1 ) spacetimes @xcite .",
    "whereas embeddings are undoubtedly useful tools in the study of ( 3 , 1 ) spacetimes ( for the purpose of algebraic classification @xcite ) , we ask what is the status of their use to remove cosmological singularities .",
    "is it mathematically rigorous , generally applicable and physically meaningful ?    by ` singular ' we mean geodesically - incomplete @xcite . in the study of singularities , timelike and",
    "null geodesics ( t.g s and n.gs ) are the only objects of fundamental importance since they are the curves privileged by the free travel of massive and massless particles respectively .",
    "the other objects associated with the study of singularities arise as a matter of convenience rather than being fundamental .",
    "such objects include the expansion and shear of geodesic congruences , and curvature scalars .",
    "because these objects are closely - linked to material in this paper , we focus first on them ( sec 5.1 ) , explaining how they arise in the study of singularities and then demonstrating how the embedding and embedded versions of these objects can be very different ( sec 5.2 ) .",
    "we then discuss the more important issue of geodesic incompleteness in the context of embeddings ( sec 5.3 ) .",
    "an example is used to illustrate some of these points and others ( sec 5.4 ) .",
    "a lack of rigour in singularity - removal claims is uncovered in sec 5.5 .",
    "we finally treat the case with thin matter sheets in sec 5.6 .      for ( @xmath227 , 1)-dimensional cosmology , smooth congruences of past - directed normal t.gs with normalized tangents denoted by @xmath228 are considered . the decomposition _",
    "ab d_au_b = h_ab + _ ab + _ ab [ bsplit ] provides the _ expansion @xmath229 and _ shear @xmath230 .",
    "the twist @xmath231}$ ] is zero for the normal congruences considered here , in which case @xmath232 is an extrinsic curvature @xmath233 .",
    "the corresponding normal raychaudhuri equation [ c.f ( [ normray ] ) ] can now be considered .",
    "although for @xmath234 this would usually mean that a caustic develops , under certain global conditions a contradiction about the existence of conjugate points arises .",
    "singularity theorems are thus obtained ; in a cosmological context the simplest of these is ( hawking , theorem 1 of @xcite ) . _ _    for globally - hyperbolic ( 3 , 1 ) gr spacetimes obeying the sec and such that @xmath235 on some smooth ( spacelike ) cauchy surface @xmath236 , then no past - directed timelike curve from @xmath236 can have greater length than @xmath237 .    by the definition of cauchy surface ,",
    "all past - directed t.gs are among these curves and are thus incomplete , so the spacetime is singular .",
    "such theorems generalize to ( @xmath227 , 1 ) spacetimes ( provided that these obey analogous energy conditions ) in the obvious way since raychaudhuri s equation clearly behaves in the same way for all @xmath227 and the global part of the arguments uses topological space methods that do not care about dimension .    it must be noted that the singularity theorems are about existence whilst saying nothing about the nature of the singularity .",
    "ellis and schmidt began to classify singularities according to their properties @xcite , a difficult study which may never be completed @xcite .",
    "below we consider only the most elementary type of genuine singularities : _ curvature singularities , for which at least one spacetime curvature scalar such as @xmath238 or @xmath239 blows up .",
    "_      here we explain how knowledge of gauss hypersurface geometry renders it unsurprising that there are instances of singular spacetimes being ` embeddable ' in nonsingular ones .",
    "this is because the behaviour of higher and lower dimensional objects used in the study of singularities clearly need not be related .",
    "as a first example , consider expansion . in the normal case",
    ", @xmath240 and @xmath241 from which follows = - ^_. so a blowup in @xmath242 need not imply a blowup in @xmath243 . thus the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime perspective on focusing of geodesics",
    "can be completely different from the perspective on some ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurface .",
    "figure 6 shows how one s ( 3 , 1 ) notion of expansion generally corresponds to expansion and shear from the perspective of an embedding ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime .",
    "in particular , what look like caustics or singularities in the ( 3 , 1 ) spacetime could well correspond to no such feature in some surrounding ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime .    as a second example , consider curvature scalars , in particular the ricci scalar .",
    "preliminarily , gauss outstanding theorem is a clear indication that extrinsic curvature can compensate for differences between higher and lower - dimensional intrinsic curvature .",
    "our simple idea is to consider the implications for rigorous embedding mathematics of the generalization of this to the case where lower - dimensional curvature scalars become infinite . from the form ( [ agauss ] ) for the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) gauss constraint , 2= 2r _ - r = ^2 - k^ ^ - r [ singrem ] clearly - at least for some ( 3 , 1 ) worlds which have ricci - scalar curvature singularities @xmath244 - there will be surrounding ( 4 , 1 ) worlds in which @xmath238 ( and the 5-d @xmath34 ) remain finite . for it could be that @xmath245 suffices to compensate for @xmath244 .",
    "thus it could be shear , expansion or both that dominate the compensation for @xmath244 .",
    "if this involves @xmath246 , it means a ( 4 , 0 ) caustic forms in the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime corresponding to the ( 3 , 1 ) spacetime s singularity . yet",
    "this is not the only nonsingular possibility ; if @xmath247 it may be the shear that compensates , including cases in which the blowup is pure shear .",
    "finally , clearly the higher - dimensional singularity theorems hold so even if one were to succeed in excising singularities from a lower - dimensional model , one would typically expect singularities to occur elsewhere in the resultant higher - dimensional models .",
    "the nature of these higher - dimensional singularities may not be the same as that of the excised lower - dimensional ones .",
    "so , interestingly , by allowing extra dimensions , one would be even less certain of the character of singularities .",
    "the fundamental importance of geodesics is problematic for embeddings since in general the ( 3 , 1)-dimensional geodesics are not included among those of an embedding ( 4 , 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "there is then the dilemma of which of these sets of curves should be the physically privileged ones and thus be the set of curves whose extendibility is in question .",
    "if one wishes to postulate ( 4 , 1)-dimensional gr , in addition to the ( 4 , 1)-dimensional efe s one must require that the matter follows the ( 4 , 1)-dimensional geodesics .",
    "then the issue of extendibility of the original ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics becomes irrelevant since they are unprivileged curves in the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime .",
    "but this is at the price of altering what the effective ( 3 , 1)-dimensional physics is : often it will be of affine - metric type and thus in principle distinguishable from ordinary ( 3 , 1 ) physics .",
    "one can not then necessarily claim that the recovered ( 3 , 1 ) physics is as close to the usual ( 3 , 1 ) physics as is widely claimed in the braneworld literature    if these do not include the ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics , then the ( 3 , 1 ) question of what happens to these becomes physically irrelevant .",
    "one would not then be extending one s ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics but replacing them with distinct ( 4 , 1)-dimensional geodesics , which might be viewed as unsatisfactory .",
    "there is the further complication in braneworld models that one might wish for ( 3 , 1 ) and ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics to both be relevant , as the paths of brane - bound and brane - unbound matter or gravity waves .",
    "it is then not clear what is meant by a singularity ",
    "exactly which curves are supposed to be incomplete ?",
    "we end with two loose possibilities about incompleteness which might sometimes be related : the ( 3 , 1 ) singularities might be interpretable in terms of a ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurface that becomes tangent to the characteristics of the bulk equations , and incompleteness might correspond to t.gs and n.gs being forced to exit the ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurface .",
    "the second possibility is a variant on the theme of ( 4 , 1 ) and ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics whereby the ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics are pieces of ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics which are extendible only by replacing a piece of the original foliation with a new one that extends into what was originally regarded as the extra dimension .",
    "the following example illustrates many of the above points and leads us to further comments .",
    "consider a ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime with metric ( see e.g @xcite ) g_ab = ( g_tt , e _ , g_zz ) = ( -z^2 , t^ z^ _ , ) , q > 1 .",
    "[ funnymink ] this is simple to treat because :    \\1 ) if we foliate it with constant @xmath23 hypersurfaces , a portion of each @xmath248 const hypersurface has induced on it a flat flrw cosmology . in particular",

    "we restrict attention to @xmath251 due to the dec . for @xmath252",
    "there is a ( 3 , 1 ) ricci scalar curvature singularity ( @xmath253 is the radiation universe , whence @xmath254 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime is in fact minkowski .",
    "first , foliating the flat flrw cosmology with constant @xmath255 surfaces , @xmath256 as @xmath257 , so there is    ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) focusing as the big bang is approached .",
    "furthermore , _ only focusing occurs : @xmath258 .",
    "next foliate the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime with constant @xmath255 surfaces .",
    "the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime contains many flrw worlds on constant-@xmath23 surfaces .",
    "build a congruence by collecting the flrw geodesics on each @xmath248 const slice .",
    "then the ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) expansion @xmath259 also blows up as @xmath260 , but there is also a blowup of the corresponding ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) shear : ^_ab ( -e _ , 3g_zz ) , so we have case 2 of fig 7 . also , whilst still both @xmath261 and @xmath262 in this case , we know that the former viewed from within the @xmath249 ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurface corresponds to a genuine ( 3 , 1 ) singularity , whilst the latter in ( 4 , 1 ) would be a mere caustic .",
    "_    second , consider the @xmath249 slice of the ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime . here",
    "the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) expansion and shear are = , ^ _",
    "= -(3 , t^ _ ) .",
    "thus for the physical range , both blow up as @xmath257 .",
    "so the spacetime includes a @xmath124 , @xmath263 point , at which there is a ( 4 , 0 ) caustic .",
    "these blow - ups combine in @xmath264 to cancel @xmath265 for all values of @xmath227 ; for @xmath253 the shear and expansion contributions exactly cancel each other .",
    "the unphysical @xmath266 case is an example of a pure shear blowup .    although the congruence two paragraphs up is built to naturally include the geodesics of all the included flrw universes , these turn out not to be the ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics ( nor pieces of them ) .",
    "rather , by considering the coordinate transformation between ( [ funnymink ] ) and standard ( 4 , 1)-dimensional minkowsi coordinates , it is easy to show that the minkowski geodesics pierce the @xmath248 constant surfaces that are the flrw universes ( more significantly in the early universe than today ) . as @xmath257 the @xmath267 constant surfaces approach the null cone",
    "so the example is an illustration of the foliating ( 3 , 1 ) hypersurfaces becoming tangent to the characteristics at the point of interest .",
    "also the foliation breaks down as @xmath257 because the family of hypersurfaces of constant @xmath23 intersect at @xmath263 .",
    "all these points are illustrated in figure 6 b ) .",
    "finally , the example can not be taken to be typical by the ( 4 , 1 ) version of genericity .",
    "indeed , we know that not many ( 3 , 1 ) spacetimes can be even locally embedded into ( 4 , 1 ) minkowski @xcite .",
    "the value of particular examples is limited to exhibiting _ possible behaviours .",
    "one would require this to be upgraded to the study of large classes of examples to assess _ probable behaviours .",
    "indeed , one would expect higher - dimensional cosmological models to exhibit a range of behaviours distinct from that of the big bang ( including nonsingularness ) .",
    "this follows from knowledge of particular examples ( from the algebraic study ) of inhomogeneous cosmologies in standard gr @xcite .",
    "we especially note that if highly - symmetric cosmologies are haphazardly embedded , one would often expect the resulting higher - dimensional models to be less symmetric i.e more anisotropic and inhomogeneous than the original lower - dimensional models [ as naively suggested by the appearance of ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) shear from models containing no ( 3 , 0 ; 1 ) shear ] .",
    "so the resulting higher - dimensional models are expected occasionally to exhibit more unusual behaviour than the lower - dimensional models from which they arose , and this includes the possibility of nonsingular cosmologies .",
    "indeed , we would expect that an increase of dimension increases the variety of possible behaviours in inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "but the bottom line in the study of 4-d and 5-d singularities is the same : one is ultimately interested in generic behaviour and this requires more sophisticated means of study than building individual particular examples .",
    "_ _      there are arguments against the use of embedding results toward making general statements about singularity removal .",
    "our secs 2.4 and 3 provide arguments against the use of the cm result ( some of which also hold against the use of further embedding theorems ) .",
    "in particular , given a spacetime , there are so many possible embeddings . were nature higher - dimensional , why should it choose a particular nonsingular embedding out of an infinity of ( nonsingular or singular ) embeddings that mathematically exist ?",
    "the more extra dimensions are present , the more severe this nonuniqueness is .",
    "this makes singularity removal by such embeddings physically - questionable .",
    "the cm scheme , and other embedding schemes such as the 10-d minkowski embedding theorem @xcite ) , are _ local .",
    "this localness includes the notion that the theorem is only applicable to a small region of the original manifold .",
    "we question whether this need include the approach to a singularity , since these are edges of the lower - dimensional spacetime and thus have no neighbourhood .",
    "_ singularities are global features of spacetime .",
    "however even some of the global embedding theorems ( which require very many extra dimensions ) are stated for the analytic functions @xcite .",
    "but low differentiability may be typical in the approach to singularities @xcite .",
    "it becomes much harder to make any general statements once one accepts that spacetime is not analytic ! _ _",
    "one may view at least some ( 3 , 1 ) singularities as projective effects due to taking a badly - behaved foliation ( for example a foliation that becomes tangent to the characteristics ) , manifested by the formation of caustics or pure shear blow - ups . the question is why there is confusion in reversing this projection procedure to embed    ( 3 , 1 ) singularities into nonsingular ( 4 , 1 ) spacetimes .",
    "if an embedding of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; @xmath4 ) type such as those considered in this paper is to be used , it is mandatory that the region of hypersurface to be embedded be entirely of one signature @xmath2 ( the ck theorem demands a _ nowhere - characteristic lower - dimensional manifold ) .",
    "also , from the lower - dimensional perspective , the singularity can not be included in the set of points on which data is prescribed because it is an edge of spacetime , not a point of spacetime .",
    "were one to try and include it by providing data ` right up ' to that edge , one would expect that the data would become badly - behaved e.g some components of @xmath172 could be forced to be infinite . under the various circumstances above , embedding theorems become inapplicable to reconstruct the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "_      finally , we have two comments about the application to thin matter sheets .",
    "first , there is less scope for singularity removal along the lines of ( [ singrem ] ) . for ,",
    "as it is the energy - momentum on the brane , @xmath226 is presumably finite for a nonsingular ( 4 , 1 ) world so @xmath172 is finite and so can not cause blowups in @xmath268 .",
    "however , blowups in this quantity can still occur if the inverse metric is badly - behaved ( corresponding to @xmath173 = 0 ) .",
    "note however that the application of the ck theorem to gr requires this not to be the case everywhere within the region of applicability .",
    "second , one would of course require the investigation of more elaborate ( e.g ` warped ' ) embeddings than the example discussed above in order to investigate whether some embeddings lead to 5-d geodesics that exit the brane .",
    "if the ( 3 , 1)-dimensional geodesics on the brane are not included among those of the ( 4 , 1 ) dimensional bulk , it is not clear at all what is meant by ` singular ' since one then one would have to simultaneously consider some notion of extendibility two congruences of privileged curves of different dimensionality .    under the decomposition ( [ adms ] )",
    ", the 5-d geodesic equation @xmath269 becomes ^ + ^_^^ + 2k^ _ = 0 , [ geo1 ] ^ + k_^^ = 0 .",
    "[ geo2 ] if one upholds the use of normal coordinates .",
    "in order for ( [ geo1 ] ) to reduce in all cases to the ( 3 , 1 ) geodesic equation on the brane , one requires everywhere on the brane @xmath270 or @xmath271 . by ( [ geo2 ] ) , maintenance of @xmath270 along all geodesics",
    "is impossible unless @xmath272 .",
    "thus in all cases @xmath272 is required on the brane . but",
    "this means that @xmath273 or equivalently @xmath274 i.e the absence of a brane .",
    "thus in sms - type braneworlds the ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics are not generally among the ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics .",
    "so if one wishes to adhere to the postulate that bulk - traversing fields follow ( 4 , 1 ) geodesics and fields confined to the brane follow ( 3 , 1 ) geodesics , one should accept that the restriction of the former to the brane generally does not coincide with the latter .",
    "thus there may be observable consequences in the ( 3 , 1 ) physics : freely - falling bodies composed of confined matter would follow distinct paths from freely - falling bodies composed of matter capable of traversing the bulk but which happens to be moving along within the brane , which represents a violation of the equivalence principle , and the causal structures within the brane due to confined photons and due to gravitons which happen to be moving along within the brane would generally be distinct . also the above new conceptual difficulty about the definition of singularities",
    "is thus indeed relevant to brane cosmology .",
    "we are interested in the study of ( @xmath10 + 1)-dimensional gr models with thin matter sheets using only well  studied , well  behaved mathematical techniques which also make good physical sense and are applicable to full efe systems . in our view a good way of achieving this is via the ( @xmath10 , 0 ) ivp , followed where possible by the heavily - protected ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) cp .",
    "we provide a hierarchy of modelling assumptions together with associated sources of difficulty , and argue that evolution is more problematic than data construction .",
    "we concentrate on the latter , making use of all the attractive features of the york method mentioned in sec 3 , albeit this elliptic mathematics is in a new setting ( see sec .",
    "6.2 - 3 ) .",
    "the differences come about due to the following difficulties of relevance to the hierarchy of modelling assumptions .",
    "firstly , the roughness of function spaces required in the rigorous treatment of certain thin matter sheet models . secondly , the requirement of novel asymptotics and boundary conditions ( b.cs ) .    note that the increase in dimensionality itself does not affect much the data construction nor the study of well - posedness and stability of the gr cp , although there is some dimensional - dependence when the rougher function spaces come into use , due to the following two contrasting results .",
    "the first result is that in all dimensions , the presence of thin matter sheets means that the metric is rougher than @xmath275 ( the functions with continuous second derivatives ) because of the jump in the riemann tensor at the sheet .",
    "this corresponds to the metric being too rough to belong to the sobolev class @xmath276 .",
    "the second result is that the definition of a product for sobolev spaces for the efe s in harmonic coordinates according to hughes , kato and marsden ( hkm ) @xcite requires the sobolev class of the metric to be no rougher than @xmath277 [ i.e @xmath278 for standard gr and @xmath279 for ( 4 , 1)-dimensional gr ] .",
    "thus hkm s mathematics , the strongest used for both the gr ivp and cp in the review @xcite , is not generally powerful enough to deal with thin matter sheets .",
    "more powerful mathematics is thus desirable , and more may well appear over the next few years ( see the program starting with @xcite ) .",
    "realizations of part of the hierarchy of models below would be an interesting application for this sort of mathematics , which further motivates the study of increasingly rough sobolev spaces , since the higher the dimension the greater the improvement to the established hkm mathematics is required for a full study of thin matter sheets .",
    "we must also mention that in spaces rougher than @xmath276 there is no guarantee of geodesic uniqueness @xcite , so complete conventional physical sensibleness is generally lost no matter what rougher sobolev class results are proved .",
    "this shortcoming is clearly dimension - independent ( from the dimension - independence of the form of the geodesic equation ) .",
    "at least one need not go below @xmath280 whereupon geodesics need not even exist !    the asymptotics problem @xcite follows from supposing that ` ads ' bulks are desirable for string - inspired scenarios .",
    "the study of ` ads ' bulks by relativists would entail the study of asymptotically ads bulks , to permit a more general study of disturbances close to the thin matter sheet .",
    "the following comments are in order here .",
    "first , in contrast to ds , ads is infinite and hence possesses asymptotics .",
    "second , whereas we will for the moment seek to avoid the function space difficulty , the asymptotics problem will remain in the ` tractable scenarios ' . in the usual gr ,",
    "the use of ads asymptotics for the application of the york method to small - scale astrophysics was neglected because of the negligible effect of a cosmological constant on such small scales and because of dod arguments .",
    "the braneworld application is however substantially different , so one might in this case have to study the york method with ` ads asymptotics ' .",
    "this could affect the tractability of the lichnerowicz equation , and also whether the existence of the crucial maximal or cmc slices is as commonplace for these new spacetimes as it was for the ( 3 , 1 ) gr ones .",
    "furthermore , since one is interested in infinite planar branes , the asymptotics is _ directional , ` perpendicular ' to the brane .",
    "however , in general there is no such notion of perpendicularity in gr . whereas one can locally define geodesics and draw hypersurfaces perpendicular to them , this procedure in general eventually breaks down , for example due to ( spatial ) caustic formation . _",
    "we start our hierarchy by envisaging the most general situation possible for thin matter sheets within the framework of gr .",
    "it is entirely legitimate to construct a ( 4 , 0 ) initial data snapshot with whatever shape of thin matter sheet , but it is not legitimate to assume that any features of this are maintained over time unless it can be shown that the full evolution equations robustly maintain these features .",
    "strictly , this is an _ initial - boundary problem , such as occurs for water waves or for the surface of a star .",
    "this is a very hard and quite new problem in gr @xcite .",
    "thus the evolution step is particularly hard both in its full generality and in the justifiability of simplifications such as a fixed boundary . _",
    "consider a thin matter sheet in an asymmetric ( not @xmath146 symmetric ) bulk .",
    "one would ideally want to follow objects that crash into and possibly disrupt the thin matter sheet .",
    "one can then imagine asymmetric crashes which might punch though the thin matter sheet .",
    "the sheet could thicken or disperse with time .",
    "it could emit a significant amount of gravitational radiation , which could moreover include gravitational shock waves that spread out the @xmath280 character that initially pertained only to the thin matter sheet and not to the smooth surrounding bulk .",
    "that is , the @xmath280 character of a thin matter sheet data set @xmath281 could typically infect the whole of its causal future @xmath282 ( fig .",
    "7 ) . in simple words",
    ", why should the junction remain unscathed ?",
    "why should the bulk in the immediate vicinity of the junction at later times be simple , smooth or known ?",
    "addressing these questions goes beyond the reach of present - day techniques .",
    "rather we note that some usually - tacit assumptions are used to definitely avoid these difficulties , and that we do not know whether any of these are justifiable in the physics governed by the gr evolution equations .",
    "one can presuppose a thin matter sheet exists at all times to prevent it being created or destroyed .",
    "one can allow only bulks with regular thin matter sheet boundaries to preclude shock waves .",
    "one could also preclude asymmetric crashes by presupposing @xmath146 symmetry .",
    "even if discontinuous emissions are precluded , one can imagine smooth emissions and absorptions ( symmetric or asymmetric ) whereby the bulk interacts with the thin matter sheet .",
    "this would entail material leaking off or onto each side of the thin matter sheet .",
    "this can be precluded by the presupposition that the thin matter sheet s energy - momentum resides at all times on the sheet , which is encapsulated by the well - known ` equation of motion ' of the thin matter sheet @xcite .",
    "this is a significant restriction on the dynamics of thin matter sheets in gr , often carried out in the name of tractability but which may not be realistic .    in the randall  sundrum scenario ,",
    "the brane can be placed anywhere in the bulk without affecting it .",
    "we strongly suspect that this is not a typical feature in gr - based braneworlds , nor is it desirable since it dangerously marginalizes the ontological status of the bulk .",
    "we take this feature to be too specialized to be included in the developments below .",
    "we close this section by briefly discussing modelling assumptions which avoid some of the above difficulties .",
    "we then implement these in two particular classes of tractable problems .",
    "the desirability of each modelling assumption strategy and of other modelling assumptions from a string - theoretic perspective is discussed in sec 7 .",
    "\\i ) the choice of @xmath283 symmetry may well look and indeed be arbitrary from a gr point of view and indeed from a string - theoretic point of view ( see sec 7 ) .",
    "but without such a choice one simply can not establish any specific embeddings if there are thin matter sheets ( in the gr study of stars one requires the absence of surface layers to perform matchings ) .",
    "thus one studies the restricted case with @xmath283 symmetry , in which one integrates only up to the b.c provided by the j.c .",
    "in the ivp part one can assume whatever configuration of thin matter sheets .",
    "thus this step is more justifiable than the subsequent evolution , which may require some of the above _ ad hoc assumptions as to the existence and good behaviour of the thin matter sheet at all future times .",
    "so for the moment we are merely after the construction of ( 4 , 0 ) initial data up to the junction . by themselves",
    "these data are useful in addressing issues such as the shape of the extensions of black hole horizons into the bulk , but the staticity and stability of these configurations remain unaddressed in the as - yet intractable evolutionary step of the problem @xcite . _    \\ii ) one could choose instead to work with thick matter sheets i.e ones that are finitely rather than infinitely thin @xcite .",
    "then the above troubles with the function spaces need not occur , since the walls would then not be rough in the above sense , although they could still have the tractable level of roughness that is able to accommodate astrophysical objects just as in ordinary gr .",
    "it is then easier to envisage the study of the evolutionary step of the thick matter sheet problem quite high up our hierarchy , since this more closely resembles the stellar surface problem .",
    "\\iii ) one could investigate closed shells rather than open sheets in order not to require directional asymptotics .",
    "we cast the initial value constraints as - ( ) = 0 , = - c(r - m^c + ^2^b - 2^a ) , m = ^ ^ [ nonlinlich ] d_a^ab = j^b b = , c = , a = \\ {    ll & j^b = 0 + & j^b 0 . +    .",

    ". then by definition @xmath285 suffices in order to solve the codazzi constraint .",
    "furthermore , in that case a particular scaling of @xmath286 is not required to keep the codazzi constraint conformally - invariant , so preserving the dec does not enforce a particular scaling of @xmath34 .",
    "so we are left to solve just the lichnerowicz equation with the scaling of @xmath34 to be determined by our convenience .",

    "the well - known uniqueness proof based on green s identity holds , provided that lin @xmath70 everywhere .",

    "one might worry in the case of black holes that @xmath316 is singular .",

    "this @xmath146 isometry b.c is more complicated than usual because of the presence of the thin matter sheet .    that the @xmath146 symmetry is termed a reflection",
    "appears to generate a certain amount of confusion .",
    "this is because there is also the reflected wave notion of reflection , taken to give a neumann b.c ( such as in the @xmath316 condition above ) . in the case of shiromizu and shibata ( ss ) @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , who furthermore treat our known @xmath74 as their unknown , and our unknown @xmath116 as the perfect ads @xmath321 , it has the nice feature that the other 2 terms in ( [ nonlinbc ] ) cancel leaving a neumann b.c .",
    "|_z=1 = 0 , [ funnyref ] which might look like a reflection in both of the above senses .",
    "however , this is only possible for @xmath322 which may be somewhat restrictive .",
    "note also that ( [ funnyref ] ) is an unusual notion of reflection in this context , since it is of the conformally - untransformed ( 3 , 0)-metric , whereas the natural notion of reflection isometry would be for the conformally - transformed ( 4 , 0)-metric .",
    "thus we conclude that the presence of the notion of reflection ( [ funnyref ] ) in ss s work is happenstance : it is separate from the @xmath146 notion of reflection encapsulated in ( [ scndjn ] ) and no analogue of it need exist in more general situations .",
    "our b.c . ( [ nonlinbc ] ) contains a reflection part @xmath323 ; the other part being a ( nonlinear ) absorption .",
    "this has the following implications .",
    "first , the presence of absorption terms is interesting since pure reflection is the boundary condition of a perfect insulator in the potential theory of heat .",
    "this suggests that pure reflection b.cs such as for pure ads have built - in non - interaction of the bulk with its bounding brane , whereas our b.c may lead to ( evolution models ) with brane - bulk interactions .",
    "whereas neither the planar symmetry in ( 4 , 1 ) spacetime of the underlying thin matter sheet nor the @xmath307 symmetry within the ( 3 , 1 ) thin matter sheet of a simple astrophysical object generate gravity waves , we expect that spherical bumps on approximately planar branes in ( 4 , 1 ) spacetimes to admit gravity waves , potentially giving rise to instabilities in the approximately ads bulk braneworlds in which the branes contain astrophysical objects",
    ". our b.c could permit the modelling of such interactions .",
    "second the nonlinear absorption ( much as arises in the theory of heat with temperature - dependent conductivity ) is likely to complicate both analytic and numerical treatments of our b.v.p .",
    "the first point above is one reason to favour our approach over that of ss ( subject to overcoming the complications due to the second point ) .",
    "we now provide a further reason why the approach we present should be favoured on the long run . whereas one could try to generalize ss s work by keeping the notion that @xmath74 be unknown and @xmath116 known but not @xmath324 , whereupon our b.c ( [ nonlinbc ] ) is interpreted as an inhomogeneous neumann b.c in @xmath74 ,",
    "the main trouble with ss s work is that there is no good reason for their method to be directly generalizable away from its restrictive assumption @xmath303 . whereas treating @xmath74 not @xmath116",
    "as the unknown may give nicer b.cs , it is not tied to a method known to be amenable to less trivial solutions of the codazzi equation than @xmath325 .",
    "our proposed method seeks a workable extension to the significantly more general case @xmath326 , and speculatively to completely general @xmath327 .",
    "another nice feature in ss s work is that the matter is scaled so that the linearized p.d.e obtained is a poisson equation .",
    "this p.d.e is simply invertible to obtain detailed asymptotics @xcite . for our scheme ,",
    "the linearized equation ( [ linlich ] ) is of helmholtz - type rather than poisson , complicating such a procedure .",
    "we merely demand instead that @xmath328 for @xmath23 large wherever possible so that our models are ` directionally asymptotically ads ' . as for large @xmath1 , at least on the brane , one can impose asymptotic flatness as @xmath329 .",
    "it is less clear what one should prescribe in this respect off the brane .",
    "a more detailed study of the asymptotics for our b.v.ps should be required as part of the actual construction of examples of data sets .",
    "our proposed b.v.p is thus the mixed , nonlinear problem \\ {",

    "simplification i ) might be plausible because 5-d ads clearly admits conformally - flat spatial sections [ @xmath330 ) ] or maybe not , since it is regarded with suspicion in the ( 3 , 1 ) gr 2-body problem @xcite .",
    "the trick at the end of sec 6.2 can not be used to obtain particularly simple examples due to the following argument . unless one puts @xmath331 ( constant ) and",
    "has this maintained by non - scaling ( i.e @xmath332 ) , it is overwhelmingly probable that the emergent @xmath333 is not constant .",
    "thus our freedom in @xmath317 is used up to ensure that @xmath333 is constant .",
    "our algorithm for solving this problem is as follows :    \\i ) prescribe the following unphysical quantities : the metric @xmath76 and matter density @xmath34 .",
    "\\ii ) pick any suitable @xmath334 to solve the codazzi constraint .",
    "it follows that @xmath296 is known .",
    "\\iii ) thus we can attempt to solve our b.v.p for the lichnerowicz equation to obtain @xmath116 .",
    "\\iv ) then we can compute the physical bulk metric @xmath335 and induced brane metric @xmath336 of our snapshot .",
    "this assumes that we have correctly guessed the profile .",
    "one would now check whether this is the case by solving for the apparent horizon .",
    "if this is unsatisfactory ( fig 8c ) then one would repeat the algorithm with adjusted profile .    for nonvacuum branes ( @xmath337 ) , a similar argument enforcing @xmath332 holds .",
    "the j.c may now be split into a trace b.c part ,    . | _ z = 1 = 0 and a restriction on the tracefree part of the matter on the brane , which is y_^ = 0 [ 95 ] for the metric ansatz and coordinate choice used .",
    "our algorithm now becomes    \\i ) one now requires the prescription of @xmath338 everywhere and of @xmath339 .",
    "\\ii ) pick any suitable @xmath334 and hence @xmath296 .",
    "iii)attempt to solve our b.v.p for the lichnerowicz equation .",
    "\\iv ) then we can compute @xmath335 and @xmath340 . in this particular case , the simultaneous imposition of normal coordinates and an isotropic line element forces the restriction ( [ 95 ] ) on the braneworld matter .",
    "this is because one is applying too many coordinate restrictions ; in this light the habitual practice of working in braneworlds using normal coordinates may be seen as a poor choice of gauge .",
    "if the above coordinate choices are not simultaneously made , the algorithm would contain further nontrivial equations [ in place of ( [ 95 ] ) ] to solve before the braneworld matter content can be deduced .",
    "we assume that this nonvacuum application is for a star or clump of dust on the brane in which case there is no need to excise a corner with a profile as was done above to deal with the black hole singularity .",
    "notice the lack of control of the physical metrics characteristic of theoretical numerical relativity .",
    "our non - scaling of the matter at least gives visible control over the matter .",
    "the sensibleness of doing this is in fact tied to the negativity of the bulk @xmath34 : for @xmath341 and @xmath342 , lin receives a negative contribution with its tendency to encourage ill - posedness , whereas for predominantly @xmath343 , the danger @xcite lies in @xmath344 .",
    "a simpler example of b.v.p set up along the lines we suggest is that of nakamura , nakao and mishima @xcite .",
    "their metric is cylindrical not spherical and they have a slightly simpler version of ( [ nonlinbc ] ) .",
    "their case is still time - symmetric .",
    "the linearized equation is then precisely helmholtz , facilitating its inversion and the consequent more detailed knowledge of the asymptotics .",
    "we also propose the 2-brane version of the above , in which the @xmath345 condition is replaced by another ` parallel ' brane boundary at @xmath346 .",
    "this problem is close to that considered by piran and sorkin @xcite .",
    "in contrast however , their study involves a periodically - identified fifth dimension to which there does correspond an isometry - based reflection neumann condition @xmath347 .",
    "we can provide a local ( in function space ) uniqueness proof for our proposed type of b.v.p , at the same level as that for standard gr black hole data in @xcite . in the conformally - flat case ,",
    "suppose that @xmath348 for @xmath80 small .",
    "then the homogeneous linearized b.v.p in @xmath80 is applicable .",
    "we then have _ ( |u|^2 + u^2)d^4x = _ ( |u|^2 + uu)d^4x = _ uds",
    "=    l _ z = z uds + _ r = r uds + - _ z = 1 + uds - _ r = uds    by green s theorem . for @xmath349",
    "at least as fast as @xmath324 , the first surface integral tends to zero . for @xmath349",
    "at least as fast as @xmath350 the second surface integral tends to zero .",
    "the fourth integral is zero by the neumann reflection b.c . upon applying the linearization of the nonlinear b.c ( [ nonlinbc ] ) , .",
    "z=1 = 0 , [ linrob ] the third surface integral is non - positive provided that the restriction @xmath351 holds .",
    "thus since lin @xmath70 u must be zero .",
    "for the non - conformally flat case , this argument requires @xmath352 .",
    "the argument is not seriously changed in the black hole case when a corner is excised by a profile with a robin condition on it .    stronger existence and uniqueness proofs for our proposed problems",
    "are complicated by four factors :    unboundedness , ( albeit of the most benign kind ) , the boundary having corners , mixed b.cs ( i.e a piecewise prescription on the boundary ) and a portion of these being nonlinear .",
    "the first is however of the simplest kind and the second and third are commonplace .",
    "the last is less usual but perhaps not so bad either because by @xmath353 the problem can be written in divergence form , for which b.v.ps with nonlinear b.cs are treated in ch .",
    "10.2 of @xcite .",
    "the trouble is that the treatment there , unlike here , is neither for mixed b.cs nor for an unbounded region with corners .",
    "thus , the strongest point we can make at present is that there is good hope of obtaining existence and uniqueness results even for quite rough function spaces by more - or - less conventional , entirely rigorous mathematics for our proposed problem .",
    "this should be contrasted with the hopeless state of affairs with sideways prescriptions !",
    "once one begins to get good numerical results , it becomes worthwhile to explicitly prove the well - posedness of the method used , in order to support those results and the ongoing production of more such results . in this particular case",
    ", these results would serve to support and understand the crucial numerical step iii ) in the above algorithms .    to permit the even greater generality required to have momentum flows ( @xmath304 ) , by our route one",
    "is forced to forfeit the dec control over the matter .",
    "this is because at least the @xmath145 part of @xmath34 can not scale in accord with the scaling of @xmath354 .",
    "we leave this further development , which additionally requires posing and solving the b.v.p following from the codazzi equation , for a future study .",
    "many of the difficulties with evolution discussed above stem from the thinness of the matter sheets causing function - space - related problems .",
    "but ordinary physics should not be sensitive to which function space is used .",
    "one would hope that models with thick matter sheets would be more amenable to study , be good approximations to the thin matter sheets and in any case could be closer to reality than thin matter sheets .",
    "bonjour , charmousis and gregory have used the ( 2 , 1 ; 1 ) version of the general split ( [ gauss ] ) , ( [ cod ] ) , ( [ evk ] ) with scalar matter and consider both thick walls and the thin - wall limit perturbatively in the presence of gravity .",
    "they further specialize to the case of a spherical domain wall , which they show collapses",
    ". it would be worthwhile if this sort of example , which combines the modelling assumptions ii ) and iii ) , is investigated using the    ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) split subject to flat and to ads asymptotics .    for the particular example mentioned above",
    ", the matter profile is sigmoidal .",
    "however , to approximate a thin brane , one would want instead a hump profile , as indicated in fig 9a .",
    "one could still use an inner b.c at @xmath249 , where now @xmath355 so that the linear robin b.c . | _ z = 1 = 0 [ thickrob ] holds .",
    "one could in fact consider 2 problems ( see fig 9b ) : the flat sheet with directional asymptotics and the spherical sheet with a suitable inversion - in - the - sphere in place of the above inner b.c .",
    "both of these problems avoid the main obstacles to existence and uniqueness proofs by possessing linear b.cs .",
    "the second problem is also invertible to an inner problem which is on a bounded region with no corners , for which results in @xcite apply .",
    "these problems are for ` plain ' thick branes as opposed to branes containing spherically - symmetric objects .",
    "the first problem ought to more easily admit this extension .",
    "one might wish to study ` plain ' thin branes too , e.g in the context of branes in relative motion .",
    "finally , suppose instead one attempted to use magaard s method to construct ( 4 , 0 ) thin - matter - sheet data .",
    "then one benefits from @xmath7 and the identification of @xmath356 with the @xmath249 brane prescribes the topology , removes some of the sources of nonuniqueness and the brane s energy - momentum endows physical significance upon the ( 3 , 0 ) covariance of the elimination procedure . in the thin matter sheet case , one is blocked by the nonanalyticity of @xmath34 , but at least some thick matter sheet models could be built in this way .",
    "we first address * q2 by discussing how the work in this paper may be generalized and which of these generalizations may be regarded as stringy .",
    "we end with the conclusions of this paper as regards * q1 . *",
    "*    we did not consider the possibility of a higher codimension @xcite which could substantially alter the nature of the embeddings used . for models with 2 or more times ,",
    "it is simply not possible to stick entirely to our suggestion to build on established mathematical physics .",
    "finally , our study could be complicated by having more than the einstein tensor in the bulk .",
    "for example , one can have a nontrivial lovelock tensor term @xcite in dimension 5 , which arises from the variation of a gauss  bonnet term in the action , or one could have genuine higher - derivative terms @xcite . whilst our incipient results such as the correspondence between ( @xmath10 , 0 ; 1 ) and    ( @xmath10 - 1 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes at the simplest level or our befe ambiguity will have counterparts in these theories , these theories equations are much larger than the efe s , and their cp / ivp is much less well - studied than that of gr .",
    "higher derivatives or non - standard bulk matter might lead to the violation of the energy conditions used in this paper .",
    "we next discuss which features of gr - based braneworld models are desirable for string theory .",
    "first for some caveats .",
    "we introduced the sms braneworld as a gr generalization of the randall  sundrum scenario , moreover one that was as yet not sufficiently general for the purposes of gr in which the nature and existence of thin matter sheets at all times might not be a representative presupposition .",
    "it could be that it is other aspects of the randall  sundrum scenario that are of interest in string theory since it also has particle physics aspects to it and because it is a toy model of hoava ",
    "witten theory .",
    "one may prefer to consider only such stringy scenarios rather than randall  sundrum or sms .",
    "also a great source of tension between string theorists and relativists is that the latter believe gr is suggestive of the importance of background ",
    "independent theories , whilst there is as yet no background  independent formulation of string theory available .",
    "such ideas as conserved charges , flat sheets and simple bulks arise from assuming minkowski or ads backgrounds .",
    "since gr is background - independent , one is interested there in generic solutions to the full field equations .",
    "this makes the notion of asymptotics necessary and subtle , and not necessarily compatible with flat sheets nor conserved charges . from a general perspective",
    "it is doubtful whether highly - specialized solutions such as minkowski or ads are likely to reflect the gravitational physics of the universe , unless it can be shown that large classes of generic solutions behave likewise or are attracted toward such solutions .",
    "string theory might favour many extra dimensions , although it is not clear how many of these should be large and how many compactified . among the corrections to the einstein tensor mentioned above , string theorists might favour the presence of the gauss  bonnet correction , since this is the only first - order correction for a heterotic string @xcite ; an infinite series of correction terms is predicted .",
    "string theorists might favour very flat walls on the grounds that these could be stabilized by being the lowest - energy carriers of bps charge @xcite .",
    "these arguments would rule against the use of highly symmetric bulk manifolds / orbifolds , although string theorists might try to invoke them as fixed backgrounds so as to perturb about them . there may be different reasons for stability in gr and string theory .",
    "for example , in contrast to string - theoretic arguments favouring reflection - symmetric orbifolds , a gr domain wall could be stable precisely because the ( 3 , 1 ) bulk is different on each side , as the wall separates domains in which symmetry is differently broken . on the whole",
    ", the string theorist would agree that bulks could be complicated by the presence of bulk matter from the closed string multiplet , as mentioned in sec 4.5 .",
    "at least in some models , gauge fields would be expected to occur only as fields confined to branes since they belong to the open string multiplet and some branes are where open strings end @xcite . as strictly , the branes are of planckian thickness , so it is not a disaster that thick branes are favourable toward rigorous mathematics for gr - based scenarios ( this is recycling the argument in footnote 11 ) . of course , one could worry that they are thin enough for quantum gravitational effects to be important .",
    "we now address * q1 . we feel that it is secure to say that gr - based braneworld models only make sense if realistic examples of them are stable to the dynamics which governs gr .",
    "we have investigated two schemes within which this study might be furthered : the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) and ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) schemes . *    as regards ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) schemes , before pressing on with something like the sms braneworld by perturbation theory and dynamical systems analysis , we think that it is important to check that the sms braneworld s interpretation is properly understood .",
    "we have demonstrated that there exist many reformulations of sms s befe s , thus making it clear that it is a choice as to whether the befe s contain sms s weyl term ( requiring closure as some complicated third - order system such as in sms s paper ) , and that it is a separate choice as to whether any terms homogeneously quadratic in the thin matter sheet energy - momentum tensor feature in the befe s .",
    "we have used this to illustrate the danger in truncating the befe s by setting bulk terms to be zero or to take a particular form . the full ( 4 , 1)-dimensional picture of the brane is required . building this picture by sideways evolution appears unlikely to be well - behaved mathematically or to make sense from a physical ( causal ) point of view .",
    "we hope that this paper will either stimulate new research where these concepts are carefully thought about or force an admission that it is preferable to use a ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) scheme .",
    "we have argued that the removal of singularities by the ( 3 , 1 ; 1 ) scheme is unlikely to be generally possible in a meaningful way . whichever of the two schemes one works in , one is well - advised to heed the old , careful literature about solving the gauss  codazzi system rather than starting afresh .",
    "we have carefully detailed which parts of this traditionally ( @xmath10 , 0 ) scheme easily pass over to the ( @xmath1 , 1 ) case .",
    "as regards the ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) scheme that we have argued is favourable , we have argued that its ivp step is cleaner than its cp step and by itself serves to answer a number of questions .",
    "we have provided a survey of obstacles and ideas to extend this ivp with a thin matter sheet away from the relatively trivial time - symmetric cases hitherto considered .",
    "we also suggest that thick branes are more easily treated rigorously and that this choice should not affect the underlying physics if it is respectably robust .",
    "we feel that the next stage should be to solve for such data numerically . as this field grows",
    ", the underlying analytic mathematics will deserve detailed attention .",
    "we note that the scope of the ( 4 , 0 ; 1 ) scheme would go as far as the study of colliding black holes , which are expected to be an important source of gravity waves .",
    "one requires the kind of methods that we promote in this paper for gr - based braneworlds for the full study of such high - curvature processes .",
    "whilst this study is a tall order even for the usual gr @xcite , these calculations may be required if braneworld effects can be large enough to substantially alter the extreme physics of colliding black holes .    finally , we summarize the aspects of * q2 that should be asked as the partial answers to * q1 begin to be built up . does the introduction of stringy features change the outcome to any of issues ? and",
    "so , are gr - based braneworlds adequate or typical frameworks for string theory ? what scenarios should one explore in order to furnish string theory with reasonably unique predictions ?",

    "a ) given data for a hyperbolic system on a piece of a spacelike surface , we can predict the future only in the forward wedge ( domain of dependence ) within which all causal curves , i.e allowed paths of information flow , emanate from the data . outside this wedge , for all we know , large disturbances ( represented in the picture by gravity waves ) could influence the future arbitrarily soon .",
    "*    \\b ) if we claim to know the 4-dimensional dod , we preclude the influence by the extra dimension , thus making it largely redundant .",
    "the 5-dimensional dod of a thin sheet is small because of the thinness of the sheet .",

    "no matter how thin in the @xmath23-direction one considers @xmath368 to be , it is always pierced by causal curves such as @xmath61 on or in the light - cone , by taking @xmath61 to be at a sufficiently slender angle @xmath116 to @xmath367 .",
