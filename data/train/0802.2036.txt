    "massive stars play an important role in the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and galaxies ; nevertheless their formation process is still poorly understood from the observational perspective because of their relatively short evolution periods , complex ambient circumstances and gregarious nature .",
    "two important approaches are systematic surveys and multi - wavelength studies towards individual sources to increase our knowledge about high - mass molecular cores that may harbor forming massive stars or mark the sites of future massive star formation .",
    "previous surveys of high - mass star - forming regions focused on the sources associated with ultra - compact ( uc ) hii regions and their precursors ( puchs ) @xcite .",
    "these works identified a number of high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) @xcite .",
    "however , the identified objects usually have high luminosities ( @xmath6 ) , indicating that most of them do not represent the earliest stage of massive star formation . by comparing millimeter and mid - infrared ( mir )",
    "images of fields containing candidate hmpos , @xcite further identified a sample of potential high - mass starless cores ( hmscs ) , which may be the sites of future massive star formation .",
    "however , their mir identification based on 8.3@xmath5 m images from the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( _ msx _ ) was not sufficient to validate a genuine hmsc , because a heating accreting protostar may remain undetected up to 8@xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "the recently released high - resolution sensitive mir and far - infrared ( fir ) images obtained by the galactic survey of the _ spitzer space telescope _ could be used to verify these hmsc candidates .    at the same time , some works towards individual sources indicated that massive cores at early stages might exist in the vicinity of evolved star - forming sites like uc hii or hii regions @xcite .",
    "these works suggest that previously identified evolved sources may harbor objects at various evolutionary phases , including hmscs , high - mass cores harboring accreting protostars , and hmpos @xcite .",
    "one scenario is that the early - stage objects are stimulated by the star - forming activities in evolved regions .",
    "another hypothesis is that they may form with their evolved companions during the fragmentation of parent clouds , but are restrained to give birth to stars in time by some physical supporting mechanisms .",
    "the third possible explanation is that the detected objects are just diffuse quiescent gas / dust clumps and will not form stars eventually . probing the physical properties and circumstances of these objects may help to address the questions above .",

    "our photometric results at 850@xmath5 m are in good agreement with theirs ( see the last two columns of table  [ tb3 ] ) , but the 450@xmath5 m results from scuba are systematically larger . since ukt14 is a single - element bolometer and its measurements may be affected by the change of sky conditions and other factors , we believe that the calibration of scuba data is more reliable . the photometric differences of the jiggle and scan maps are acceptable , less than 20% at 450@xmath5 m .",
    "we examined the cso map and the mips images to measure the flux densities of each clump at 24 , 70 and 350@xmath5 m .",
    "since smm1 saturates the 24 and 70@xmath5 m images , only lower limits can be derived at these wavelengths .",
    "in addition , we checked the _ msx _ psc and found that the photometric apertures of smm1 and smm3 are coincident with the _ msx _ point sources msx6c  g060.8828 - 00.1295 and msx6c  g060.9049 - 00.1275 respectively .",

    "the results in table  [ tb5 ] show that the sub - mm clumps are all massive ( 110220@xmath3 ) .",
    "smm1 has a higher dust temperature , and its bolometric luminosity dominates in the whole region , implying the existence of strong internal heating source(s ) .",

    "the two - temperature model fits the observational data very well above 12@xmath5 m , which is consistent with the physical fact that there are warm dust around the internal heating sources and relatively cool dust envelopes surrounding the star - forming sites in smm1 and smm3 . although the _ iras _",
    "100@xmath5 m flux density exceeds the model sed of smm1 ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) , we believe that the deviation is due to the large beam of _ iras _ . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and table  [ tb6 ] show that the warm components contribute little to the total masses and the flux densities at sub - mm wavelengths , but are required to explain the excess at mir wavelengths .",
    "we tried to modify @xmath24 to fit the emission below 12@xmath5 m .",
    "however , no satisfying results were found .",
    "the emission in the _ msx _ a and c bands does not follow the predication of gray - body models , suggesting these models are invalid at these wavelengths .",
    "generally , two significant spectral features may exist at this mir wavelength range .",
    "one is the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , which is often detected towards compact hii regions and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "previous studies have showed that the _ msx _ a and c bands often contain pah emission lines @xcite .",
    "the other is the silicate feature , which has been predicted in the dust model of @xcite and demonstrated to be important in the recent sophisticated sed models @xcite .",
    "this feature may be expected as the absorption at 9.7@xmath5 m towards some uc hii regions , produced by the dust cocoons around center objects @xcite . @xcite",
    "have identified both of pah and silicate features towards s87e in the previous _ iso _ spectroscopy observation .",
    "the silicate absorption feature may be caused by cloud ii , which partly overlaps above the compact hii region . since",
    "our gray - body models are focused to evaluate the overall properties of dust clumps , which are mainly constrained by the thermal emission from longer wavelengths , a detailed sed model explaining the pah and silicate features is beyond our purpose .",
    "all of the fir / sub - mm images and molecular line maps exhibit the complex spatial and kinematical structures of s87 .",
    "the recently published high - resolution c@xmath1o  _ _ j__=10 observation @xcite revealed several gas clumps at different velocities , which further confirms our identification of cloud i and ii .",
    "however , are cloud i and ii really related to each other ?",
    "@xcite proposed that the gas clumps at higher velocity might be on the near side along the line - of - sight because the observation of @xcite detected many reddened sources in nir there .",
    "they further reasoned that the clumps at low and high velocities were approaching and the nir cluster s87e was possibly formed by a cloud - cloud collision . in the following ,",
    "we verify the cloud - cloud collision model by a multi - wavelength comparison .",
    "firstly , the 8.0@xmath5 m emission shows a sharp edge to the northeast of mirs1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this feature is probably caused by the large extinction at 8.0@xmath5 m because the sub - mm emission is still strong .",
    "the position of the extinction patch is consistent with that of cloud ii , confirming that cloud ii is on the near side along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , cloud i and ii are approaching .",
    "next , we can infer from the intensity maps of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the peak of smm1 and s87e are in the overlapping region of cloud i and ii .",
    "the mir point sources in smm1 suggest that there is not only a formed nir cluster , but also ongoing star - forming activities .",
    "the strong and continuous star - forming process is likely to be interpreted by the stimulation of a cloud - cloud collision rather than the spontaneous evolution of molecular clouds alone .",
    "furthermore , the spatial configuration of the compact hii region and the associated extended centimeter emission @xcite also supports the cloud - cloud collision model .",
    "the champagne flow model of @xcite combined with clumpy structures of molecular clouds can explain the extended centimeter component which stretches to the southeast of the compact hii region .",
    "if cloud i and ii are in contact , their contact plane will be along the northwest - southeast direction ( see fig .  [ fig5]b and fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) .",
    "consequently , the compact hii region will be better confined in the direction perpendicular to the contact plane and the champagne flow should be easier to spurt out in the southeast direction . if cloud i and ii are not in contact , the champagne flow will be more likely to splash in the direction perpendicular to the border of the parent cloud of the compact hii region .",
    "the observational result is consistent with the predication of the first scenario , supporting that the two clouds are colliding . assuming that the two clouds have typical sizes @xmath35 @xmath4 1pc and a velocity separation @xmath36 @xmath42kms@xmath8 , the collision duration is at least @xmath37yrs , comparable with the time scale forming a compact hii region .    the cloud - cloud collision is considered as an efficient mechanism to trigger star formation .",
    "it may compress molecular gas and lead to local gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "however , its possibility is small in the diffuse molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "additionally , high velocity off - axis collisions could be destructive rather than lead to gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fraction of star formation triggered by cloud - cloud collisions may be small in our galaxy .",
    "all of the current evidence demonstrates that s87 is a new example of cloud - cloud collisions , and similar samples are still limited @xcite .",
    "our observation shows that the line profile of hco@xmath19  _ _ j__=10 is similar to that of co  _ _ j__=10 ( see the left panel of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "additionally , we found that both of co  _ _ j__=10 and hco@xmath19  _ _ j__=10 spectra show slight features of high - velocity ( hv ) gas when compared with c@xmath1o  _ _ j__=10 , suggesting that hco@xmath19 extends in diffuse gas rather than simply concentrates in the dense parts of gas clumps .",
    "previous observational and theoretical works have pointed out the abundance enhancement of hco@xmath19 in diffuse or shocked gas @xcite , which can explain our finding .",
    "however , the formation mechanism of the hv gas in s87 is unclear .",
    "we propose three different explanations : ( i ) the hv gas may arise from stellar outflows ; ( ii ) it may be contributed by the high - pressure shocked material that is squirted out when the clouds collide ; ( iii ) or , it is from the non - impacting portions of the colliding clouds since they do not slow down to a common speed during the cloud - cloud collision . although @xcite identified hv blue and red wings in her co",
    "_ _ j__=10 observation and proposed that the hv gas resulted from a biconical outflow with a wide opening angle viewed at large inclination , our identification of two individual clouds apparently rejects this model .",
    "high - resolution and sensitive observations are required to clarify the origin of the hv gas .    because both stellar outflows and cloud - cloud collisions can produce hv gas and broad non - gaussian line profiles",
    ", it is possible that some observational results previously interpreted as bipolar outflows are caused by cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "however , since the possibility of cloud - cloud collisions is not high , similar cases like s87 should be rare .",
    "a feature of the nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) intensity maps is that the nh@xmath7 emission tends to `` evade '' the luminous mir sources .",
    "the nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) peak of cloud i is separate from mirs1 and the sub - mm peak of smm1 .",
    "the nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) emission is absent to the southeast of mirs1 , where the diffuse mir emission is strong .",
    "the nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) peak of cloud ii is coincident with smm2 , which has no mir counterpart .",
    "in contrast , the observations of @xcite and @xcite showed that the c@xmath1o  _ _ j__=10 and cs  _ _ j__=54 emission is strong in smm1 and smm3 .",
    "since both of smm1 and smm3 are dense clumps identified from sub - mm continuum , their relatively weak nh@xmath7 emission may be explained by the underabundance of nh@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite suggested that nh@xmath7 could be destroyed by c@xmath19 that dominates in pdrs .",
    "however , molecules like c@xmath1o are formed via c@xmath2 and not affected by the photo - destruction process @xcite . the diffuse 5.8 and 8.0@xmath5 m emission near smm1 and smm3",
    "is usually contributed by pahs and interpreted as a tracer of pdrs . the existence of mir emission there , as well as the strong c@xmath1o  _ _ j__=10 emission and the weak nh@xmath7 emission , are consistent with the prediction of the chemical process proposed in previous works .",
    "the line widths of molecular spectra are usually used to probe the kinematics of gas clumps .",
    "since cloud i and ii can be well resolved in nh@xmath7 lines , we estimate the virial masses of these two clouds in this section .",
    "we derived the line widths and brightness temperatures of nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) at the nh@xmath7 peaks of cloud i and ii , using the hyperfine structure fitting procedure of gildas / class .",
    "the results are exhibited as thin lines in fig .",
    "the angular diameters @xmath38 of cloud i and ii are calculated using the equation : @xmath39 in which , @xmath40 is the measured angular area of each cloud .",
    "after that , we corrected the beam effect and estimated the intrinsic sizes of cloud i and ii following the equation : @xmath41 where @xmath35 is the radius of the gas cloud in pc , @xmath42 is the distance of s87 , and @xmath43 is the beamwidth of the nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) observation . assuming that cloud i and ii are homogeneous spherical gas clouds with a density distribution @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and neglecting the contributions from magnetic field and surface pressure , the virial masses can be derived using the equation @xcite : @xmath46 in which , @xmath47 is the virial mass in @xmath3 and @xmath48 is the full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of nh@xmath7  ( _ j_,_k_)=(1,1 ) in km  s@xmath8 .",
    "all the measured and derived parameters of cloud i and ii are listed in table  [ tb7 ] , including : the positions of nh@xmath7 peaks , the angular and intrinsic sizes , the line widths at nh@xmath7 peaks , and the derived virial masses of two clouds .",
    "the total virial mass of cloud i and ii is @xmath4430@xmath3 , which is much smaller than the previous estimation ( @xmath41080@xmath3 ) obtained with the total line width of two components @xcite but comparable with the mass estimated from the sed fitting ( @xmath4460@xmath3 , from the isothermal dust model ) .",
    "however , we note that the above comparison of the masses estimated from different approaches can be affected by the adopted dust opacity and the assumption of @xmath49 . although a variation of @xmath49 is not likely to cause much change in virial masses , the dust opacity may change by at least a factor of 2 @xcite , which leads to a large uncertainty in the masses estimated from seds .",
    "the position of mirs1 is consistent with that of the compact hii region , within the astrometric error ( 1.5 ) , indicating that mirs1 is the exciting massive ( proto)star .",
    "we examined the high - resolution centimeter map of @xcite and found that neither mirs2 nor mirs3 shows compact radio continuum emission .",
    "the possible explanation is that mirs2 and mirs3 are less evolved compared with mirs1 or they are not massive enough to ionize their surroundings and to excite compact hii regions .",
    "@xcite detected a strong water maser in smm1 , which is often considered to be associated with hmpos .",
    "the velocity range of this water maser is 2125kms@xmath8 , in good agreement with the systematic velocity of the molecular clouds .",
    "all the evidence mentioned above supports that smm1 is a high - mass star - forming site that harbors massive forming stars or cluster .",
    "the lyman continuum radiation from massive stars mainly escapes in the form of free - free emission .",
    "@xcite estimated that the lyman continuum photon flux required to keep the entire region of s87e ionized was @xmath50photonss@xmath8 , which corresponds to that of a b0.5 zams star .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of such stars is @xmath4 @xmath51@xmath52 @xcite , slightly smaller than that of smm1 ( @xmath4 @xmath53@xmath52 , from the two - component model ) .",
    "the extra luminosity of smm1 may come from the relatively weak mir sources near mirs1 , which can not be traced by the free - free emission .",
    "smm3 contains the bright 24@xmath5 m source mirs4 .",
    "the ratio of the luminosities from its cool and warm components is @xmath4 2.1 , lower that of smm1 .",
    "its bolometric luminosity is @xmath4 740@xmath52 , also lower than that of smm1 , which indicates that smm3 is more likely to be an intermediate - mass star - forming site .",
    "no mir point source or diffuse emission below 70@xmath5 m is detected towards smm2 . since only a cold dust component",
    "can describe its observational sed , strong internal heating sources are not likely to exist in smm2 .",
    "@xcite detected a weak 22ghz water maser near smm2 , which usually arises from the dense circumstellar disks around protostars @xcite or originates in outflows from the birth of a massive star @xcite .",
    "since this water maser is in the velocity range 815kms@xmath8 , significantly different from that of the molecular clouds , we favor the second explanation for its origin .",
    "we notice that this water maser is on a sub - mm emission ridge connecting the peaks of smm1 and smm2 rather than near the peak of smm2 , and its position uncertainty is large when compared with sub - mm observations .",
    "therefore , we doubt that this weak maser is produced by the intrinsic factors of smm2 . for instance , the potential outflows from massive protostars of smm1 may shock the ambient molecular gas of smm2 and produce a weak water maser at the rear side of smm2 .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the lower velocity of the water maser .",
    "we believe that the existence of this water maser does not necessarily contradict smm2 s physical properties derived from the sed and mir image analyses . based on the information available",
    ", we support that smm2 is probably a hmsc that may form massive stars or intermediate star clusters eventually .",
    "we have carried out a multi - wavelength study of the massive star - forming region s87 .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .    1 .  we identified three sub - mm clumps in s87 , labeled as smm1 , smm2 , and smm3 .",
    "they are estimated to have masses of 210 , 140 , and 110@xmath3 , with average dust temperatures of 41 , 21 , and 24k respectively ( from the isothermal gray - body model ) .    2 .",
    "we examined molecular line maps from our observations and compared them with previous results of other authors .",
    "we concluded that the star - forming activities in smm1 are stimulated by a cloud - cloud collision .",
    "the stellar contents and star - forming activities of sub - mm clumps are identified .",
    "their seds reveal that these clumps are at various evolutionary stages .",
    "smm1 and smm3 are high - mass and intermediate - mass star - forming regions respectively .",
    "smm2 is massive and cold , has no mir counterpart , which is probably a hmsc .",
    "all of these results expose that the star formation in s87 is at multiple phases .",
