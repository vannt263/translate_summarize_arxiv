    "@xcite several experimental systems are known to be of or dominated by a ladder - type structure , and theoretical studies have been able to make reasonable predictions about the phases , symmetries and transport properties of these materials .",
    "@xcite a common procedure used to solve ladder systems is a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) treatment , followed by a non - perturbative bosonization of the relevant interactions .",
    "the combination of these two complimentary techniques allows one to go beyond the usual mean - field approaches when determining ground states and excitations in the low - energy regime .",
    "@xcite some studies using these techniques have revealed exotic phases , such as a staggered - flux phase  @xcite and a resonant - valence - bond liquid .",

    "it is rather remarkable that typical tll scaling appears to exist over a wide range of temperatures . in this reference",
    "it was claimed that rg flows quantitatively reproduce the experimental data , but the bare interactions which lead to this solution were not discussed .",
    "this exciting development inspired us to revisit the well - known two - leg ladder system , modified to describe a realistic interaction profile while also taking into account the ladder geometry , as shown in fig .",

    "the hopping strengths between nearest neighbors on the same leg and nearest neighbors on the same rung are @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . for on - site interactions",
    "the charge and spin interactions take the same form and can be described by a single parameter @xmath5 . in general ,",
    "interactions between two different lattice sites along the same leg are described by @xmath6 , while interactions between two lattice sites on opposite legs are described by @xmath7 .",
    "the charge and spin interactions are represented by @xmath8 respectively and the integer index @xmath9 describes the rung difference between the two sites .",
    "therefore , any set of generic short - range or quasi - long - range interactions can be described by the bare interactions @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although there have been extensive theoretical investigations on electronic correlations in two - leg ladders ,  @xcite most of these studies only consider nearest - neighbor ( or next - nearest - neighbor ) interactions .     and",

    "electron - electron interactions can be defined similarly to the standard case.,width=226 ]    the standard two - leg ladder lies in a two - dimensional plane , but there are a number of experimental systems which contain a two - leg ladder which is warped in some fashion .",
    "@xcite we consider a ladder which has been compressed so that the legs form a zigzag with a constant angle @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",

    "it is easy to see that for extremely short - range interactions the zigzag angle @xmath12 does not play any significant role since the on - site interaction @xmath5 dominates .",
    "however , in ladder materials the interaction is often expected to be quasi - long - ranged and in these cases @xmath12 is important . with the inclusion of this zigzag lattice geometry , as well as",

    "instead one finds bosonic spin and charge excitations which propagate independently of each other and with different velocities , a phenomenon known as spin - charge separation .",
    "many theoretical and experimental studies have discussed tll phase in several different 1d or quasi-1d systems such as weakly - coupled chains or wires ,  @xcite carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite and the edges of two - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite with screened charge interactions theoretical studies have shown that tll are generally expected in odd - leg ladders  @xcite but not in even - leg ladders except under unphysical conditions such as attractive interactions .",
    "@xcite these general trends make the tll scaling behavior observed in lpb  @xcite a little unexpected , though as the two legs in lpb are almost independent ( @xmath15 ) it is certainly not impossible .",
    "there are two plausible scenarios for the observed tll - like behavior in lpb .",
    "the first scenario is that the ground state is a true tll and that the interaction profile and the ladder geometry in lpb result in an unusual set of bare couplings that flow towards the tll phase under rg transformations .",
    "the alternative possibility is that the ground state is not a tll but closely resembles a tll over a wide range of temperatures . in an attempt to solve this puzzle",
    "we will use lpb as an example when determining the phases of our two - leg ladder with zigzagged legs and generic interactions .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the two - leg model that contains various charge and spin interactions . starting from the lattice model , we briefly describe the chiral decomposition , current algebra , computation of initial couplings and the bosonization . in sec .",
    "iii , we generalize the theoretical approach to the two - leg ladder with general zigzag angles .",
    "we also introduce different order parameters to characterize the ground states .",
    "the complimentary combination of the rg method and the bosonization techniques allows us to obtain the phase diagrams for different interaction profiles and bending angles .",
    "we consider two examples , the half - filled case with @xmath16 and the quarter - filled case with @xmath17 , with the latter case corresponding to lpb . in sec .",
    "iv , we make use of the general theoretical framework developed in previous sections and try to determine an appropriate interaction profile for a tll in lpb .",
    "we perform detailed and extensive numerical analysis and compute the temperature - dependent tll exponent .",
    "finally , we conclude our numerical results and discuss their connections to experiments .",
    "we consider a two - leg ladder with quasi - long - range charge and spin interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian contains non - interacting hopping as well as charge and spin interactions over different ranges .",
    "thus , it is natural to divide the hamiltonian into six parts , @xmath18 the first term @xmath19 describes hopping along the legs of the ladder with hopping strength @xmath3 , and along the rungs with hopping strength @xmath4 , @xmath20 the subscript of the fermion operator @xmath21 describes leg number @xmath22 , rung number @xmath23 , and spin @xmath24 .    for the on - site interaction ,",

    "hard \" cutoff length @xmath35 for the interaction profile .",
    "the perpendicular hamiltonian describes interactions between sites on different legs @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the interaction strength between sites @xmath27 and @xmath38",
    ". the parallel hamiltonian describes interactions between sites on the same leg @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the interaction strength between sites @xmath27 and @xmath41 .",
    "following the same classification the spin interactions are contained in two parts , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "like @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the spin interaction hamiltonians describe interactions between any two sites which are @xmath35 or less rung positions distant from each other . for spin interactions between sites on different rungs , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the interaction strength between sites @xmath27 and @xmath38 and the spin operators are @xmath48 where @xmath49 are pauli matrices . for spin interaction between different sites on the same leg , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the interaction strength between sites @xmath27 and @xmath41 .",
    "we now follow a standard procedure which involves decomposing the lattice fermions into pairs of chiral fermions with linear dispersion . as this procedure",

    "the phase in this region is either d - sc or s - sc , with the d - sc to s - sc phase transition running approximately through the center .",
    "each phase is characterized by a unique set of rg solutions of the eight coupling constants and generally , while renormalizing , the coupling constants flow gradually towards this final final solution . in the red region",
    "the coupling constants do not initially flow towards either a d - sc or s - sc solution but instead towards a solution typical of the d - sc to s - sc phase transition .",
    "this scaling behavior continues as @xmath172 increases , but at some point there is a sudden change and the rg will flow rapidly to either a d - sc or s - sc solution .",
    "this scaling behavior is typical when extremely close to a phase transition , but it is not usually observed in regions as large as the red region in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaselpb2 - 10](a ) .",
    "it is quite possible that this region could be mistaken for a tll phase , as we shall explain in more detail in the next section .",
    "note that this region is very close to @xmath173 so it may explain the tll observations in lpb .",
    "in the previous section we constructed various phase diagrams while assuming physically realistic conditions , yet did not observe a tll . in this section",
    "we look more closely at what is required for the rg equations to flow towards a tll solution .",
    "we simplify the problem a little by considering a two - leg ladder with the interaction cutoff @xmath174 .",
    "note that in this limit , the zigzag angle @xmath12 does not affect the initial values of the couplings and thus can be ignored .",
    "this model was discussed in ref . to describe lpb and solved using rg flow equations equivalent to the ones used here .",
    "note that one of the key features for tll is the critical exponent @xmath175 of the single - particle density of states .",
    "quasi - particle excitations are not found in a zero - temperature tll so the single - particle density of states @xmath176 at energy @xmath67 should be suppressed near the fermi energy @xmath177 .",
    "this suppression is expected to follow a power law @xmath178 for some positive constant @xmath175 as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "@xcite    in ref .",
    ", it was argued , both experimentally and theoretically , that the nature of the critical exponent @xmath175 indicates that lpb has a tll phase .",
    "a remarkable agreement was found between the experimental value of @xmath175 and the theoretical value obtained from the rg solutions , but what electron - electron interactions would provided the required initial conditions of the rg equations were not stated . here",
    "we will discuss the electron - electron interactions which may support a tll in a lpb - like two - leg ladder .",
    "we can evaluate @xmath175 numerically at different temperatures from the coupled rg equations .",
    "note that the the temperature scales as @xmath179 under rg transformations , where @xmath180 is the initial ( bare ) temperature .",
    "therefore , when calculating the couplings flow with the logarithmic length scale @xmath172 , we can compute the critical exponent @xmath175 at different temperatures .",
    "it is known that the exponent takes the form , @xmath181 if it approaches a constant during the rg analysis we have a hint of tll behaviour .",
    "@xcite for convenience we separate this critical exponent into two parts , @xmath182 where @xmath183 as has been discussed previously , the couplings in front of the sinusoidal terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bosonized ] ) determine the energy gaps and thus the nature of the phase .",
    "if none of these couplings become relevant under rg transformation , the ground state is gapless and is characterize by the so - called luttinger parameters @xmath184 and @xmath185 in the charge and spin sectors . in this case",

    "( [ eq : bosonized ] ) remains , which corresponds to the tll hamiltonian .",

    "this is in agreement with what we have already stated about a tll , i.e. the rg solution of @xmath175 must flow to a constant value .",

    "in fact , @xmath186 remains constant in rg flows .",
    "therefore @xmath187 must be a constant and @xmath188 always increases .",
    "this implies @xmath189 is a constant and the flow of the exponent @xmath175 is essentially determined by @xmath190 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath175 will be when @xmath191 , which corresponds to @xmath192 and @xmath193 , or equivalently @xmath194 .",
    "when @xmath195 ( or @xmath196 ) @xmath190 will decrease , as must @xmath175 , but when @xmath197 both @xmath190 and @xmath175 will increase .",
    "the point @xmath198 is more significant that just the turning point of @xmath175 .",
    "the rg flow equations indicate that once this point has been reached our system can not be a tll and @xmath175 will increase at an increasing rate .",
    "so , once @xmath199 , or equivalently @xmath197 , in the rg flows , the tll phase is unstable and some energy gaps will appear .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that with @xmath200 satisfied we may have a tll but it is not guaranteed .    returning to our specific example of lpb , we again assume quarter - filling and set @xmath201 , @xmath171 . in this case @xmath202 . using the initial conditions in eqs .",

    "then even greater restrictions are placed on @xmath212 .",
    "as the interaction strengths are unknown we must attempt to make a reasonable guess .",
    "we set @xmath155 and to make the numerical search practical we set @xmath217 .",
    "then , we fit the experimental data by varying the bare values of the charge interactions @xmath218 and the spin interactions @xmath219 . according to experimental data  @xcite @xmath220 , with @xmath221 corresponding to the highest temperature measurement .",
    "so , we set @xmath222 as this marks the minimum of @xmath175 and this sets @xmath223 .",
    "the maximum value is set to @xmath224 so @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "these conditions determine the initial values of @xmath227 which in turn determine @xmath218 for a given choice of @xmath219 . the rg flow of @xmath175 which corresponds to the experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : purpbronze ] , with the initial temperate @xmath228 k. we find that a tll with @xmath229 is only obtained when @xmath212 is quite large ( significantly larger than @xmath5 ) and negative , which is unrealistic for lpb .",
    "this does not mean that a tll phase is impossible for lpb as we must bear in mind that these simple one - loop rg solutions are not expected to be quantitatively correct and should really only be used for qualitative analysis .",
    "consequently , forcing the theoretical value of @xmath175 to fit the experimental data is not recommended and will not give a good prediction of the interactions in the lattice .     at quarter - filling with @xmath201 , @xmath171 , @xmath155,@xmath230 and @xmath231 with @xmath232 . while the arrow indicates increasing @xmath233 for the curves",

    "[ fig : llnot](a ) we show that the general line shape observed in experiments is obtainable when @xmath212 is not particularly large , although it must be _ ferromagnetic _ because we are still bound by the condition @xmath210 if we wish to have a tll . in fig .",
    "[ fig : llnot](b ) we show that when we do not have a tll @xmath175 may still adopt a variety of line shapes , some of which strongly resemble a tll as their turning point is very close to @xmath234 , in particular the @xmath235 case . also , by rescaling the interaction strengths it is possible to rescale almost any @xmath175 to have a very low temperature turning point .    if we rescale all interactions by the same factor @xmath236 so that @xmath237 then , because the initial couplings are linear in the interactions we can define a new set of couplings @xmath238 in terms of these rescaled interactions , @xmath239 . rescaling the rg flow equations in the same way",
    "gives @xmath240 where @xmath241 and because it is the ratios @xmath242 which essentially determine the phase both @xmath243 and @xmath238 should flow towards the same solution and eventually describe the same phase .",
    "however , this does not mean they will have the same scaling .",
    "the rescaled temperature is @xmath244 and so @xmath245 and therefore , by choosing an appropriate @xmath236 we may rescale @xmath175 so that its turning point is very close to @xmath234 and the phase may closely resemble a tll over a large temperature scale .",
    "for example , the @xmath246 curve in fig . [ fig : llnot](b ) has a turning point at @xmath247=115 k , but if we choose @xmath248 we rescale to @xmath249 and @xmath250 which rescales the turning point of @xmath175 to @xmath251 k. similarly , if we choose @xmath252 we obtain a turning point at @xmath253 k.     at quarter - filling with @xmath201 , @xmath171 , @xmath155 and ( a ) @xmath254 resulting in a tll , ( b ) @xmath255 , @xmath216 not resulting in a tll.,width=302 ]    in fig ( [ fig : rgflow ] ) we show the rg flow of the couplings for the @xmath155 , @xmath235 case .",
    "these couplings mostly behave very much like one would expect in a tll , with @xmath97 , @xmath95 and @xmath256 approaching zero while @xmath257 and @xmath96 are fairly constant , resulting in a fairly constant @xmath175 over a large temperature range .",
    "only @xmath94 does not have typical tll behavior as it does not approach zero . because of this the rg eventually flows away from typical tll behavior and the couplings",
    "become large , in this case flowing towards a typical d - sc solution . in the previous section",
    "it was mentioned that the region outlined in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaselpb2 - 10](a ) is not a tll , but may be mistaken for one .",

    "as the experimental data of lpb also hints at an increase in the critical exponent @xmath175 near @xmath234 ,  @xcite it can not be ruled out that the observed scaling is indeed a close crossover from tll - like behavior to some superconducting or density wave phase near zero temperature .    ) at quarter - filling with @xmath201 , @xmath171 , @xmath155 , @xmath258 and @xmath259.,width=302 ]",

    "when increasing the range of the interactions the number of variables inevitably increases . rather than considering each interaction strength as an independent variable and dealing with all the associated problems , we can simply assume that the interactions are inversely proportional to the distance between lattice sites , thus keeping the number of parameters to a minimum . using this method",
    "we were able to solve the rg solutions for any number of interactions while only needing three variables , @xmath5 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , to describe the electron - electron interactions .",
