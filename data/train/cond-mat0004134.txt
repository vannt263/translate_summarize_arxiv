    "since the high-@xmath6 cuprates are in essence doped mott insulators , systematic studies of the evolution of the normal - state properties upon changing the carrier concentration are very useful for elucidating the origin of the peculiar normal state .",
    "bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath3 ( bi-2201 ) system is an attractive candidate for such studies , because the carrier concentration can be widely changed by partially replacing sr with la @xcite .",
    "moreover , this system allows us to study the normal - state in a wider temperature range , because the optimum @xmath6 ( achieved in bi@xmath0sr@xmath1la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 with @xmath9@xmath100.4 @xcite ) has been reported to be about 30 k , which is lower than the optimum @xmath6 of la@xmath1sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 ( lsco ) .",
    "however , a number of problems have been known so far for bi-2201 crystals : ( i ) the transport properties of bi-2201 are quite non - reproducible even among crystals of nominally the same composition @xcite ; ( ii ) the residual resistivity of @xmath11 is larger ( the smallest value reported to date is 70 @xmath12 cm @xcite ) than other cuprates ; and ( iii ) the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath13 is weak and thus the cotangent of the hall angle @xmath14 does not obey the @xmath15 law @xcite .    in our group",
    "at criepi , we have recently succeeded in growing a series of high - quality crystals , in which the above problems have mostly been overcome @xcite . here",
    "we report most recent data of @xmath4 and @xmath5 of our bi-2201 crystals in a wide range of carrier concentrations to demonstrate that the normal - state transport properties in those clean crystals display behaviors that are in good accord with other cuprates .",
    "the single crystals of bi@xmath0sr@xmath1la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( bslco ) are grown using a floating - zone technique .",
    "the crystals are annealed in oxygen to sharpen the superconducting transition width .",
    "pure bi-2201 is an overdoped system @xcite and increasing la doping brings the system from overdoped region to underdoped region . in our series of crystals ,",
    "the optimum doping is achieved with @xmath9@xmath100.4 , which is consistent with previous reports on bslco @xcite .",
    "the actual la concentrations in the crystals are determined with the inductively - coupled plasma ( icp ) analysis .",
    "we note that the optimum zero - resistance @xmath6 reported here is as high as 38 k , which is not only the highest value ever reported for bi-2201 system but also almost equals that of the lsco system .",
    "dependence of ( a ) @xmath11 and ( b ) @xmath13 of the bslco crystals with various @xmath9 .",
    "note that the extrapolated residual resistivity of @xmath9=0.39 sample is 25 @xmath12 cm , which is the smallest value to date for bi-2201 or bslco . ]",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath11 for eight @xmath9 values ( @xmath9=0.23 , 0.39 , 0.49 , 0.51 , 0.66 , 0.73 , 0.76 and 0.84 ) in zero field . clearly , both the magnitude of @xmath11 and its",
    "slope show systematic decrease with increasing carrier concentration ( decreasing @xmath9 ) .",
    "note that it is only at the optimum doping ( @xmath9=0.39 ) that @xmath11 shows a good @xmath16-linear behavior : in the underdoped region , @xmath4 shows a downward deviation from the @xmath16-linear behavior , which has been discussed to mark the pseudogap @xcite . in the overdoped region",
    ", @xmath4 shows an upward curvature in the whole temperature range ; the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath11 in the overdoped region can be well described by @xmath11=@xmath17 ( with @xmath18@xmath191.2 for @xmath9=0.23 ) , which is a behavior known to be peculiar for the overdoped cuprates @xcite .    shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) is the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath13 for the eight samples . here",
    "again , a clear evolution of @xmath13 with @xmath9 is observed ; the change in the magnitude of @xmath13 at 300 k suggests that the carrier concentration is actually reduced roughly by a factor of 5 upon increasing @xmath9 from 0.23 to 0.84 .",
    "note that the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath13 is stronger than those previously reported @xcite and that pronounced peaks in @xmath5 are clearly observed in optimally - doped and underdoped samples .",
    "when @xmath20 is examined , we found that @xmath20 obeys a power - law dependence @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is nearly 2 in underdoped samples but shows a systematic decrease with increasing carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows examples of the @xmath20 vs @xmath21 plot , for @xmath9=0.66 and 0.39 .",
    "we note that the @xmath15 law of @xmath20 is confirmed for the first time for bi-2201 in our crystals .     vs @xmath21 plot for @xmath9=0.66 and 0.39 . ]",
    "we present the @xmath4 and @xmath5 data of a series of high - quality la - doped bi-2201 crystals in a wide range of carrier concentrations .",
    "it is shown that the optimum zero - resistance @xmath6 of bi-2201 can be as high as 38 k. the normal - state transport properties of our bi-2201 crystals show systematics that are in good accord with other cuprates ."
