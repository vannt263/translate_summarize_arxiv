    "entanglement , _ the _ characteristic trait of quantum mechanics  @xcite , has been identified as a fundamental physical resource for quantum computation and information , and its quantification and detection have been the subject of considerable research . however , despite a remarkable progress in the field , the so - called _ separability problem _ , the question whether a state @xmath0 is entangled or not , has not yet a general answer .",
    "more precisely , a quantum state described by density matrix @xmath0 of a system composed of two subsystems of dimension @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , is called entangled @xcite iff it can not be written as a separable state of the form @xmath3where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "currently the most important criterion for deciding whether a given state is entangled or not is related to the semidefinite positivity of the partial transpose @xmath6 : separable states have a positive semidefinite partial transpose ppt , hence all non - ppt states are entangled . for systems with @xmath7 and @xmath8 dimensional hilbert spaces the ppt - criterion also turned out to be sufficient @xcite , but for higher dimensional systems there exist ppt entangled states .",
    "further , a complete characterization of separable states exists based on `` _ _ entanglement witness _ _ '' .",
    "briefly speaking , entanglement witnesses are operators that are designed directly for distinguishing between separable and entangled states@xcite . a hermitian operator @xmath9 is called an entanglement witness if it has a positive expectation value with respect to all separable states , @xmath10 the negative expectation value is hence a signature of entanglement , and a state with @xmath11 is said to be detected by the witness .",
    "the latter condition offers the possibility of experimental detection of entanglement via the measurement of @xmath9 , an observable which _ witnesses _  the quantum correlations in @xmath0 .    historically , a violation of bell s inequalities  @xcite provided the first test for entanglement .",
    "bell s inequalities were originally designed to prove that quantum mechanics is incompatible with einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) local realistic view of the world  epr35 but , within quantum mechanics , they can be also regarded as non - optimal linear witness operators .",
    "geometrically , separable states form a convex set in the space of all density matrices of a given system and one might expect that special types of nonlinear witnesses can approximate the convex set of the separable states better than linear ones . in particular , following schroedinger remarks on relations between the information content of the total system and its subsystems , some separability criteria in terms of entropic uncertainty relations were derived .",
    "classically , if a system is formed by different subsystems , complete knowledge of the whole system implies that the sum of the information of the subsystems makes up the complete information for the whole system .",
    "the shannon entropy @xmath12 of a single random variable is never larger than the shannon entropy of two random variables , that is : @xmath13 . in the quantum world , there exist states of composite systems for which we might have the complete information , while our knowledge about the subsystems might be very poor or null .",
    "the canonical example is given by a pair of qubits a and b prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath14 .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath15 of qubit a is equal to @xmath16 , compared with a von neumann entropy @xmath17 of @xmath18 for the joint system .",
    "it has been shown nielsen98,cerfadami99,horodecki98 that for separable states the relation@xmath19holds as a consequence of the its concavity @xcite but , unfortunately , the inequalities ( [ neumann ] ) are not sufficient to characterize separability .",
    "the idea to use higher order ( nonlinear ) entropic inequalities as separability - vs - entanglement criteria for mixed states born when cerf and adami @xcite and the horodecki family horodecki96,rhorodecki96 recognized that conditional rnyi entropies are non - negative for separable states and it was recently proposed by several groups @xcite , in the form of conditional tsallis entropies .",
    "these entropic inequalities are satisfied by all separable states and are known to be stronger than all bell - chsh inequalities .",
    "recently derkacz and jacbczyk @xcite studied the relationship between entanglement , as measured by concurrence @xmath20 , mixedness , as measured by linear entropy @xmath21 , and bell - chsh violation .",
    "these authors showed that the subset @xmath22 on the @xmath23 plane , previously investigate by munro et al .",
    "@xcite , is the sum of disjoint subsets @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with the following properties : states belonging to @xmath27 violate chsh inequalities , states belonging to @xmath25 satisfy chsh inequalities , states from @xmath28 , different but with the same entropy and concurrence , can violate or satisfy chsh inequalities .",
    "following derkacz and jacbczyk , in this paper the relationship between two - qubit states entanglement and the violation of entropic inequalities on the @xmath23 plane is investigated .",
    "the quantum rnyi entropy depending on the entropic parameter @xmath29 is given by @xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 reduce to the logarithm of the rank , the von neumann entropy and the negative logarithm of the operator norm , respectively .",
    "the conditional rnyi entropy reads@xmath34the tsallis entropy , given by@xmath35is non - negative , concave ( convex ) for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and reduces the von neumann entropy in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the conditional tsallis entropy reads@xmath39concerning positivity , however , the two conditional entropies are equivalent , i.e:@xmath40which is equivalent to@xmath41the conditional tsallis / rnyi entropies , involving higher power ( @xmath42 ) of density matrix @xmath0 , provide a more stringent criterion for separability@xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to obtain the subset of the entanglement - mixdness plane corresponding to violation of quadratic entropic inequalities ( @xmath43 ) . in this case",
    "it is possible to extract a nonlocal and nonlinear quantity , namely , the renyi entropy , from local measurements on two pairs of polarization - entangled photons as showed in @xcite",
    ".    the entanglement can be quantified by the quantity @xmath44 which is known in literature as _ concurrence .",
    "_ wooters has derived an analytic formula for the concurrence of two - qubit states:@xmath45where @xmath46 are the square roots of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the complex conjugate of density operator @xmath0 .",
    "the mixedness measure is the so - called _ linear entropy _ and is based on the purity of a state @xmath49 .",
    "the linear entropy @xmath50 for @xmath51 systems is defined via@xmath52 , \\]]and ranges from @xmath18 to @xmath16 ( for a maximally mixed state ) .    in the entanglement - mixedness or , in this case ,",
