    "in quantum mechanics , it is well known that there is no way to distinguish different nonorthogonal quantum states perfectly without a wrong guess by measurement .",

    "she gives state @xmath0 to bob , whose task is to identify the given state @xmath0 with one in the set @xmath2 .",
    "when considering such a discrimination problem , two settings are often studied as a standard one . in one",
    "setting , the discrimination success probability is maximized without any restriction on the probability of an incorrect guess @xcite .",
    "this is called minimum - error discrimination since the mean probability of error is minimized as a consequence . on the other hand , a wrong guess is not allowed in the setting of unambiguous discrimination . instead",
    ", the inconclusive result `` i do nt know '' is permitted when the measurement fails to give a definite identification for the input state @xcite .",
    "some other alternative approaches have also been proposed .",
    "one interesting scheme is a maximum - confidence measurement analyzed in refs .",

    "@xcite , the probability of correct discrimination is maximized while the rate of inconclusive results is fixed .",
    "we consider a setting of maximizing the discrimination success probability under the condition that the mean probability of error should not exceed a certain error margin @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when the error margin @xmath3 is 0 , the setting is equivalent to unambiguous discrimination . in minimum - error discrimination",
    ", no condition is imposed on the probability of error , which means the error margin @xmath3 is 1 .",
    "thus , this formulation naturally unifies the two commonly adopted settings by controlling the error margin . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we analyzed discrimination with the error margin between two pure states with general occurrence probabilities and obtained the optimal discrimination success probability in a fully analytic form .",
    "the two - dimensional parameter space consisting of occurrence probabilities and the error margin is divided into three domains : minimum - error , intermediate , and single - state domain . the types of optimal measurement differ depending on the domain . however , for the discrimination problem among more than two pure states , even in the two standard settings it is not easy to obtain analytical solutions , though a great number of works on general theories have been reported @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the case of three symmetric states @xcite of a qubit .",
