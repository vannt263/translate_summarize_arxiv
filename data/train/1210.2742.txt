    "a significant amount of experimental data for particle production in high energy heavy ion collisions ( 10 - 200 gev/@xmath0 at center of mass ) has been accumulated during the last two decades .",
    "many different theoretical attempts have tried to described these data using thermal models in the approximation of global thermal equilibrium , considering just one freeze - out temperature @xcite-@xcite . because of its simplicity , these models are widely used to treat and explain the data . however , thermal models often are not able to describe adequately all multiplicities of hadrons @xcite . for instance , the abundance of strange particles are overestimate and the pion yields are underestimated .",
    "in addition to that , particle number density and total energy density calculated in chemical freezing are overestimated as well @xcite . to overcome these limitations some features",
    "have been incorporated into the model , like the inclusion of a phenomenological parameter @xmath1 to adjust the strangeness production in the reaction process @xcite-@xcite , or even the inclusion of effects of excluded volume @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the main criticism is that the oversimplified conception of the model makes its connection with more elaborated models @xcite-@xcite a hard task .",
    "this happens for example when trying to compare results from thermal models with those from hydrodynamical models , non equilibrium kinetic equation approach or even with others phenomenological statistical model including the formation of separated thermal subsystem @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium proposals for a phenomenological treatment of the hadronic system has been recalled with the advent of lattice calculation results , showing that the hadronization critical temperature differs significantly from the chemical freeze - out temperature estimated , using thermal conventional models , by tens of mev @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of non - equilibrium features in handling with hadron production in high energy collision were revived trying to justify the difference between critical and freeze out temperatures in these calculations . however , the used arguments were not strong enough to be compatible with rhic results few years latter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the solution is still far from being conclusive , but some effort have been made more recently in this direction @xcite .",
    "the main idea goes back to the hagedorn s states , introduced in the 1960 s , to quickly drive hadrons to chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the introduced gas of hadronic resonant states should have a mass spectrum parametrized by the hagedorn s exponential form using a critical temperature , the hagedorn temperature .",
    "the discussion of the possibility of have different values of hagedorn temperature for baryons and mesons in the hadronization process was addressed in ref.@xcite . however , the inclusion of the highest mass branch of observed hadronic resonant states in the hagedorn exponential parametrization of the spectrum fails , and the critical temperature parameter value can not be well defined @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work",
    "we assume that the chemical freeze - out stage is not characterized by a global thermal equilibrium with a single temperature of the expanding fireball . instead of this",
    ", it was introduced a picture of the fireball freeze - out stage out of equilibrium having baryonic and mesonic sectors characterised by two distinct temperatures , which could be considered as being an effective thermodynamic quantities associated to these sectors .",
    "indeed , we have no well founded reason to support the conventional thermal model statement of equal thermal evolution for mesons and baryons during the whole evolution of the system . the chemical freeze - out can occur in non - equilibrium condition before the kinetic freeze - out regime . only after the later stage it is believed that the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached .",
    "consequently , only simplicity arguments supports the isothermal fireball assumption for the chemical freeze - out .    since the pioneering works by fermi @xcite and heisenberg @xcite on thermal models , the idea of treating baryons and mesons as distinct thermal sectors was suggested . in these works baryons",
    "arise merged in a meson cloud and the description for particle multiplicity are essentially statistical in nature .",
    "when the concept of temperature is introduced in fermi s work , it is defined by relating the number of particles with the energy density of the system by mean of the stefans - boltzmann law .",
    "the hagedorn resonance mass spectra mentioned previously is nothing more than another way to associate an effective temperature to the thermal state of the system . in this case",
    "the assumption is that baryons and mesons are produced in thermal contact with a correspondent hagedorn thermal reservoir , defined by the observable mass spectra of baryons and mesons .",
    "different effective temperature values for mesons and baryons are extracted from this association @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the experimental difficulties in establish the observable particle resonance spectra , some ambiguities values of these effective temperatures can be found @xcite .    in our case , we are assuming that baryons and mesons are directly in contact with the thermal vacuum from where particles are produced .",
    "this is an image compatible with the use of a grand canonical ensemble behind the fermi distribution ( for baryons ) and bose - einstein ( for meson ) employed to determine the density of particles at the freeze - out in thermal models . at the beginning of the chemical freeze out",
    "mesons and baryons are produced from an initial thermal vacuum state , whereas at the final stage , and due to the depletion of energy density of the expanding system , the vacuum should be considered at a different thermal state .",
    "the meson freeze - out is associated to this final stage .",
    "we remark that these two effective temperatures introduced here in the thermal model still preserves the relatively simple model skill to perform calculation , bringing this kind of approach closer to a more detailed description of the fireball expansion .",
    "having in mind this qualitative arguments , a necessary condition to validate this alternative model is the improving of the results obtained with the conventional calculation .",
    "thus , as a preliminary task , we applied the two - temperatures model to different collisional processes with well established data set for particle ratios , and comparing results with those obtained with the conventional model .",
    "in addition , we discuss the behavior of freeze out temperatures , entropy and baryonic chemical potential for increasing collision energy of nucleus - nucleus reaction .",
    "this work is organized presenting firstly in section ii , the main changes introduced in the conventional thermal model ( @xmath2-model ) due to the two - temperatures description ( @xmath3-model ) .",
    "the results obtained for particle ratios within the modified model and they comparison with the results of a conventional thermal calculation is shown in section iii .",
    "the analysis of temperature , entropy and chemical potential behavior with the increasing collision energy is presented in section iv . and finally , our conclusions and final discussions are given in section v.",
    "in thermal models the particle density of the @xmath4th particle is obtained using the distribution functions of baryons and mesons given by the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions functions respectively , in the following way @xmath5   \\pm1}dp,\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , the minus ( plus ) sign stands for the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) distribution , @xmath7 is the spin degeneracy and @xmath8 is the chemical potential , using @xmath9 ; baryon , meson ) for temperature of different sectors .",
    "the chemical potential of the @xmath4th particle @xmath10 is calculated using the global chemical potentials @xmath11 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the baryonic , isospin and strangeness numbers of the particle respectively .",
    "the global chemical potentials are constrained to the conservation of global baryonic , isospin and strangeness charges as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ; target , projectile ) are the number of protons and neutrons of the colliding nuclei and @xmath18 is the volume of the fireball .",
    "this procedure can be understood in connection with the generalized gibbs ensemble prescription @xcite .",
    "the complete lightest baryonic octet , decuplet , and mesonic nonet are included , together with around two hundred of other baryonic and mesonic resonances with masses up to 2 gev .",
    "it is also important to point out that the particle population calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1]-[qs ] ) ( to be compared to the data ) should be modified due to the decay chain of resonances , a process known as the feed - down of particle populations .",
    "we reformulated the resonance decay feeding processes of the conventional thermal model in order to make it consistent with the two - temperatures approach .",
    "for that , the final density of produced particles are given by ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the thermal particle density calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and @xmath21 is the probability of particle @xmath22 to decay into particle @xmath4 , taken from experimental particles decay data .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) the specific effective temperature for baryons and mesons .",
    "the results obtained from the conventional model with one temperature , referred in this work as @xmath2-model is now compared with those from the two - temperatures model , the introduced @xmath3-model .",
    "we have performed the conventional calculation by using the @xmath3-model code with the constraint @xmath23 .",
    "the two - temperatures code was written from a previous version of thermal model developed by two of the authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a monte carlo sampling of the model parameter values covering a wide range of the domain was taken in order to speed up the computational calculation .",
    "results of the parameter values ( temperatures and baryochemical potentia ) for the best fitting of the particle population ratios produced in the five systems under analysis are compared in tables [ table1 ] ( 1t - model ) and [ table2 ] ( 2-tmodel ) .",

    "in this work we have suggested a non - equilibrium scenario for the thermal freeze - out in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "distinct temperatures are introduced to handle with thermal densities of baryons and mesons .",
    "conceptually , these temperatures are associated to the thermal state of the vacuum from where particles are produced . in our calculation ( figures [ fig1]-[fig3 ] ) we have shown that within the two - temperatures model we can obtain a rather good fits for the ratios of particles population in a wide region of parameters values ( figures [ fig3]-[fig4 ] ) .",
    "a similar situation was also obtained for other analyzed systems . regarding the fitting of particle ratios to the data , we did not privilege any one of the mesonic or baryonic sectors .",
    "our results from the two - temperatures model revealed the best fitting when the baryonic temperature is higher than the mesonic temperature .",
    "although previous investigations about different temperatures for meson and baryon sectors in thermal models have been done in regard to hagedorn s states @xcite , we remark that in our calculation the attributed temperatures are conceptuality differentiated from hagedorn s temperatures .",
    "concerning to the validation of the model , we are aware that further explorations with a comprehensive data sets for particles rate are necessary , as well as the analysis of other observables extracted from the experiments . in general , for a given reaction , the set of detected particle population includes only a few types of particle ratios and it is a hard task to obtain a confident model matching . in addition , it should be noted that it is usual to find in the literature different data sets coming from the same experiment , since they are constrained to different data filters or selection criteria .",
    "even so , the performed calculation ( see results in figures [ fig1]-[fig5 ] ) have shown that using the two - temperatures thermal model the quality of the fittings for the ratios of particles population were improved in a wide region of the parameters values .",
    "this opens room enough to accommodate predictions of observable not explored here , such as strangeness production , transverse distribution of momentum , total particle - antiparticles ratios , and others .",
    "finally , we remark that the effect of using the two - temperatures model on other collision systems can be enhanced since the conservation laws given by eqs .",
