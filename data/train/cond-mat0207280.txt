    "financial stock markets exhibit several universal properties , socalled stylized facts@xcite .",
    "there are no time correlations in the index for time scales larger than a few minutes @xcite .",
    "the distribution of relative changes or returns are power law distributed at large values with an exponent in the order of 3 - 4 @xcite . the absolute returns or volatilities exhibit multifractal moments @xcite . in the time development of the volatilities",
    "we find two features .",
    "the correlation decays very slowly .",
    "wether this decay is described by a power law with a small exponent or an exponential can not be decided .",
    "a power law would be equivalent with a @xmath0 noise @xcite .",
    "the joseph effect @xcite manifests itself by volatility clusters , that large changes of the index occur preferably at neighbouring times .",
    "+ these facts are interesting enough to motivate also physicists to look for microscopic models for an at least partial explanation . by microscopic models we mean a market consisting of agents following certain trading strategies together with a mechanism for the evolution of the price or the index .",
    "many different approaches have been persued in the recent years ( for reviews see @xcite or recently @xcite ) .",
    "all these models use inhomogenous agents in contrast to the effective market hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the agents are distinguished by differences in the behaviour as noise traders or fundamentalists @xcite , the wealth @xcite , the bidding prices @xcite , the trading thresholds @xcite or the length of memory @xcite .",
    "alternatively equal agents select different strategies depending on an utility function @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for creating volatility clusters may be a memory , nonlinear coupling between the price and agent parameters or the herding effect .",
    "the latter may be acchieved by a next neighbour interaction as in statistical mechanics @xcite or explicitely in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "a model including all three mechanisms is the lux - marchesi model @xcite ( hereafter abbreviated by lmm ) . if such a model accounts successfully for the stylized facts as it happens for lmm one would like to know whether all three mechanisms are needed or one alone is already sufficient . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the question whether herding alone can explain the stylized facts .",
    "+ as a model we use a simplified version of the lmm . as pointed out in @xcite",
    "there must be three type of agents for which we take noise traders ( pessimists and optimists ) and fundamentalists as in lmm .",
    "an important unique feature of the lmm is that agents can change their oppinion .",
    "herding is described by transition rates proportional to the number of agents in the new state . if we neglect the dependence of the agent numbers on the price we can use the ant formalism of kirman @xcite or its generalization by aoki @xcite . since the price has disappeared from the dynamic we have to find a phenomenological relation in terms of the agent numbers . for that we use the observation @xcite , that in the lmm the dynamics of the price is much faster than that of the agents and therefore the equilibrium relation can be used .",
    "assuming a constant number of fundamentalists the kirman model can acchieve qualitative agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the time structure of the clusters is in disagreement with the data .",
    "moreover there exists a winning strategy for the fundamentalists , since noise traders are not allowed to become fundamentalists .",
    "therefore we use a three component herding model where herding is included also for the fundamentalists as in @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we describe the data ( german dax index @xcite ) .",
    "we use the volatility distribution , the the correlation function of the volatility and as a new feature the waiting times between volatilities larger than a certain minimum value .",
    "section [ price ] is devoted to the description of the agent strategies and the price relation . for large numbers of agents",
    "the kirman model can be written in terms of a fokker - planck equation . instead of using transition probabilities",
    "we formulate the dynamics by the corresponding langevin equation for the fraction of agents . this model and its consequences",
    "are described in section [ 2komp ] .",
    "the formalism can be easily generalized for three components ( section [ three ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are contained in section [ concl ] .",
    "the indices @xmath1 of stock markets show a long term increase . this is a rather small effect , f.e . for the german dax index 0.03%/day over 30 years . apart from that there are no time correlations on time scales larger than a few minutes @xcite .",
    "in contrast the absolute values of the return or the volatility defined by @xmath2 exhibits the stylized facts mentioned in section [ intro ] , if we consider dayly variations . unfortunately also",
    "the values of @xmath3 averaged over few years show long term variations , as pointed out in @xcite . to avoid a long term bias we chose the dayly quoted values of the dax in the time period 1996 - 1999 corresponding to 784 trading days , where the three month average of @xmath3 is compatible with a constant value @xmath4 .",
    "= n y    in fig.[fig1 ] we show the distribution of @xmath5 on a double log scale for these data .",
    "the use of normalized volatilities @xcite is important when comparing the data with models .",
    "since @xmath6 defines a time scale , the translation of computer time steps in a simulation into a real time is taken into account using the normalized volatilities @xmath5 .",
    "as one sees from fig.[fig1 ] both lmm and the three component model to be discussed in section [ three ] are compatible with the data .",
    "it is difficult to decide whether there is a power law behaviour at large @xmath7 or not .",
    "the errors of the data points shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( and in the subsequent figures ) are computed by binning the volatilities and taking @xmath8 as statistical error , if the bin contains @xmath9 events .",
    "+ we quantify the effect of volatility clustering by the waiting times @xmath10 between occurences of volatilities larger than a minimum value @xmath11 measuring the time @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 day .",
    "if the volatilities @xmath14 are statistically independent the probability @xmath15 for a waiting time @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where the average waiting time @xmath18 is the inverse of the cumulative probability @xmath19 .",
    "= n y    in fig.[fig2 ] we show @xmath15 for different @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath20 it agrees with ( [ d2 ] ) indicating that small changes of the index can be considered as independent . for values",
    "@xmath21 we see an excess at small and large value of @xmath10 and a depletion near @xmath22 as expected from formation of volatility clusters .",
    "the experimental distribution can be characterized by the average waiting time @xmath23 and a clustering parameter @xmath24 defined by @xmath25}\\mbox{sign } ( \\tau_0-\\tau )       \\left ( \\frac{n(\\tau)}{n_0}-p_w(\\tau)\\right )       /\\sum_{\\tau",
    "= 1}^{[\\tau_0]}p_w(\\tau ) \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 corresponds to the observed number of events at time @xmath10 and @xmath27 to the total number .",
    "the clustering parameter @xmath28 is proportional to the difference of the areas between the data and the curve @xmath15 expected from independent volatilities in the intervalls @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the average waiting time @xmath31 is    = n y    compared in fig.[fig3 ] with independent gaussean distributed volatilities given by @xmath32 and the lmm , which both are remarkably close to the data for @xmath33 .",
    "again we used the scaled values @xmath5 of the minimum volatility @xmath34 , which allows an absolute prediction for one parameter models as in equ .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) .",
    "= n y    in fig.[fig4 ] the cluster parameter @xmath24 from equation ( [ d3 ] ) is shown as function of @xmath35 .",
    "the linear increase of @xmath36 shows that there exists clustering on all scales of @xmath7 . in the lmm and the kirman model to be dicussed in section [ 2komp ] the cluster are generated by an intermittency effect by two almost stable states . in the second model",
    "the fluctuations outside the cluster are almost zero and during the cluster of the same size leading to constant @xmath28 and @xmath18 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the reversed happens in the lmm .",
    "here the fluctuations are independent for @xmath37 and the clustering begins only at large values of @xmath7 .",
    "note that the lmm has not been adjusted to these data . in view of the many parameters in this model the disagreement should not to be taken too seriously .",
    "as last experimental quantity we will use the correlation function defined by @xmath38 a meaningful experimental determination of @xmath39 requires much more statistics than used in the previous figures .",
    "therefore we use all dax data from 1969 to 2002 .",
    "the correlation function for the volatility is shown in fig.[fig5 ] on a log - linear scale .",
    "the data show a strong decrease at small values of @xmath10 which compares well with the prediction of the lmm .",
    "it fails to account for the values at large @xmath10 , which in turn are in agreement with the three component model .",
    "in order to explain the features of the dax discussed in the previous section [ price ] we introduce as in the lmm@xcite @xmath40 agents , which can adopt one of the following strategies .",
    "optimistic ( pessimistic ) noise traders buy ( sell ) at each time one unit of stock .",
    "fundamentalistic traders change their stock proportional to the difference of the actual price @xmath1 and an assumed true value @xmath41 .",
    "the system is characterized by the numbers @xmath42 of agents following strategy @xmath43 ( optimistic , pessimistic and fundamentalistic ) and the price @xmath1 . in general",
    "the dynamic will couple @xmath42 and @xmath1 in a complicated way .",
    "the new price @xmath44 will depend on the demand @xmath45 and the supply @xmath46 . to avoid dependence on splitting orders it should depend only on the difference @xmath47 which is given in our case by @xmath48 the following fairly general form of a price",
    "dynamic @xmath49 has been discussed by helbing et al.@xcite . in relation ( [ b02 ] ) @xmath50 can describe a reservoir of stocks to fulfill any order or the market liquidity .",
    "the montonically increasing function @xmath51 must satisfy @xmath52 . for the following",
    "it is irrelevant wether one assumes an exponential form @xcite , a linear function @xcite or a power law@xcite . motivated by the simulation of the lmm we assume the price changes due to to the dynamic ( [ b02 ] ) occur at a much smaller time scale @xmath53 than changes of @xmath42 or @xmath50 at the scale @xmath54 . therefore the dynamic ( [ b02 ] )",
    "will reach a fixed point before any changes in @xmath42 or @xmath50 occur .",
    "the mapping ( [ b02 ] ) has the stable fixed point @xmath55 if the stability condition @xmath56 holds , which can be achieved by sufficient large liquidity @xmath57 . from the fixed point condition",
    "@xmath55 we obtain the equation of state for the price @xmath58 this relation has been also proposed by alfarano and lux @xcite",
    ". alternatively one can consider ( [ b1 ] ) as a phenomenological relation expressing that high ( low ) price are expected , if the optimists ( pessimists ) and a price @xmath41 if fundamentalists dominate the market . in order to avoid negative prices the second term in relation ( [ b1 ] )",
    "must be much smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "since the average returns for the dax or other markets are in the order of 1% the probability for a negative price is very small . neglecting quadratic terms in @xmath7 we find for the volatility ( [ d1 ] ) @xmath59",
    "in this section we simplify the model even further by keeping the number of fundamentalists constant .",
    "this serves mainly to explain the method .",
    "it can be easily generalized to three components ( see section [ three ] ) .",
    "it has been introduced by kirman @xcite for volatility clustering and behaviour of ants .",
    "the noise traders follow the strategies denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "the transition rate @xmath61 per unit time for one agent to switch from strategy @xmath62 to @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 the number of noise traders @xmath65 is to be kept constant .",
    "the constants @xmath66 describe a spontaneous rate and @xmath67 correspond to the herding behaviour . for symmetry between optimistic and pessimistic traders @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not depend on @xmath68 .",
    "the property @xmath69 has the remarkable consequence @xcite that the equilibrium distribution @xmath70 exhibits non thermodynamical behaviour in the sense that it becomes for large @xmath71 a non trivial function of @xmath72 instead a gaussean around the mean value of @xmath73 with a width @xmath74 .",
    "this solves a problem in the lmm and other models which become trivial in the limit of many agents @xcite .",
    "the transition probabilities ( [ c1 ] ) lead to a master equation . in the limit of large @xmath71",
    "it can be written in the form of a fokker - planck equation for the distribution @xmath75 : @xmath76\\ ] ] with a drift term @xmath77 and a diffusion term @xmath78 the equilibrium distribution @xmath79 depends only on the ratio @xmath80 of the rate constants @xmath81 with the normalization given by euler s @xmath82-function .",
    "if a system is described by a fokker - planck equation , we can replace the original dynamic ( [ c1 ] ) for the individual agents by a langevin equation for @xmath73 @xmath83 with a white noise @xmath84 . in equations ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c7 ] ) no dependence on @xmath71 appears .",
    "it is hidden , however , by the condition , that the time scale @xmath54 and the rates must satisfy @xmath85 if the dynamic ( [ c7 ] ) should represent the original dynamic ( [ c1 ] ) . in the numerical simulation",
    "we use ( [ c7 ] ) in the form @xmath86 with an effective rate @xmath87 . using relation ( [ b2 ] ) for the volatility ,",
    "we arrive at a model similar to the one proposed by alfarano and lux @xcite @xmath88 our version differs from @xcite that in the latter the dynamic ( [ c1 ] ) is used and the drift term is replaced by a reflecting boundary at @xmath89 as in the lmm . for small @xmath73",
    "the system is described in both cases by a random walk .",
    "near @xmath90 the diffusion vanishes and the system remains a long time @xmath91 near the boundary .",
    "the average of the return time @xmath91 can be computed analytically @xcite . for small @xmath92",
    "we obtain @xmath93    = n y    leaving after @xmath91 the boundary @xmath89 , volatility clusters are formed by the diffusion mechanism ( [ c9 ] ) with a time scale @xmath94 . in fig.[fig6 ] the results of a simulation are shown with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the left part gives @xmath97 for @xmath98 time steps .",
    "the accumulation of points near @xmath90 is clearly seen . in the middle part",
    "we show the distribution of the volatility as function of @xmath5 .",
    "the behaviour at large @xmath7 is compatible with the data , but not the peak at small @xmath7 . on the right",
    "we show the correlation function of the volatility on log - linear scale .",
    "it agrees with the observed correlation ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) , that a sharp drop at small @xmath10 is followed by an exponential decay as indicated by the straight line in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "however , the drop is much to small and the decay too strong as compared to the data .",
    "one could get agreement with @xmath92 values near 0.5 , which would give totally unrealistic volatility distributions .",
    "apart from the peak at small volatilities and the quantitatively wrong correlations the kirman model exhibits further unwanted features . since the diffusion is fast the value of the volatilities in a cluster are always of the same size @xmath99 given by ( [ c10 ] ) and do not reproduce small size clustering seen in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the index values are bounded by @xmath100 three component model ---------------------    the three component model is obtained , if one includes in the agent dynamic ( [ c1 ] ) also the fundamentalists @xmath101 = @xmath102 .",
    "the system is described by the fraction @xmath73 as in equ .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) and the ratio of noise traders to fundamentalists @xmath103 the total number @xmath104 is to be kept constant . in order to obtain a nontrivial distribution in @xmath105 in the limit of large @xmath40",
    "we require the a symmetric herding matrix @xmath106 .",
    "the rate parameters should be symmetric between optimistic and pessimistic noise traders leading to @xmath107 there remain only five independent rate constants in the matrices @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "a last condition comes from an integrability condition for the existence of a master equation , as discussed by aoki @xcite .",
    "this reads in our notation @xmath108 now we perform the same steps from the transition rates to the langevin equation for @xmath73 and @xmath109 as in the kirman model .",
    "the equation for @xmath73 is the same as equ .",
    "( [ c9 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath109 we obtain a second equation @xmath110 with a drift term @xmath111\\rho_3\\ ] ] and a diffusion term @xmath112 where we introduced in analogy to ( [ c9 ] ) the effective rate @xmath113 and the ratio @xmath114 . the expression for the volatility",
    "is given by @xmath115 the equilibrium distribution for the fractions @xmath73 and @xmath109 factorizes into a product @xmath116 in the two component model volatility clusters are due to a large return time for @xmath117 .",
    "unfortunately , small @xmath92 are responsible for the unwanted behaviour @xmath118 in the volatility distribution . in the three component model",
    "one can avoid this drawback by a large time for a change from a small value @xmath119 to a large value @xmath120 given by @xmath121 whereas the reversed time @xmath122 is independent of @xmath120 . for simulations of the model",
    "the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be determined from the equilibrium distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "our choice @xmath125 and @xmath126 give a reasonable description of volatility distribution as can be seen from fig.[fig1 ] . with the rate parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 the empirical average waiting times shown in fig.[fig3 ] and the cluster parameter @xmath28 shown in fig.[fig4 ] can be reproduced .",
    "especially the @xmath109 dependent return time ( [ t11 ] ) leads to clustering also for small @xmath7 , as seen in fig.[fig4 ] . with these values the correlation function shown in fig.[fig5 ] can be predicted , which agrees with the data except in the transition region between the drop and the slow decay . since we are using normalized volatilities ,",
    "only the ratio @xmath129 is important for waiting times and volatility distributions .",
    "it means that changes in the index are mainly caused by transitions between noise traders and fundamentalists , and not by changes between optimists and pessimists .",
    "the ratio @xmath130 implies that changes from noise traders to fundamentalists are more influenced by the spontaneous rate than the reversed process .",
    "since the spontaneous rate may represent private information , this seems not to be unreasonable . from the average value of @xmath131 we find that the fraction of noise traders is only roughly 30% .",
    "the empirical data for a stock market as the dax can be explained by a model based on herding alone . especially the time structure of the volatility clustering can rule out a two component model . at least three components are needed .",
    "since the description of the data is comparable or better than the predictions of the lux - marchesi model , one may conclude that herding is the dominant mechanism in the lmm , and the nonlinear coupling of the price evolution to the transition probabilities is less important .",
    "+ from the values of herding parameters ( @xmath132 ) we find the surprising fact that the herding effect is much stronger for an agent in the fundamentalistic state than in the noise trader state .",
    "a possible interpretation may be the following .",
    "a typical fundamentalistic trader may be a fond manager .",
    "she follows the present majority if herding dominates . in the opposite strategy not to follow the trend a heavy risk for her career",
    "is buried .",
    "if the majority turns out to be successful she will belong to the few who experience losses and will lose her job with no opportunity to revise her strategy",
    ". this does not happen if she has followed the majority .",
    "on the long run agents not following the general trend will die out .",
    "therefore there exists a strong tendency towards herding behaviour also for the fundamentalists .",
