    "there has recently been a considerable interest in studying directional properties of optical nano - antennas composed of dielectric or metallic particles that could emit light into a desired direction  @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is a bimetallic nano - antenna , recently invented by shegai _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that is capable to work as a directional frequency filter which scatters light of different colours in opposite directions .",
    "the nano - antenna consists of two metallic nano - particles ( gold and silver ) of different plasmon resonances and separated by a small distance .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally that the antenna , when driven by a white light , can direct red and blue components in opposite directions .",
    "such an antenna could have many practical applications , for example in optical sensing and could be used as directional single photon sources , important for metrology , quantum computation and quantum information processing .",
    "another kind of nano - particles that could be employed to work as an optical nano - antenna are single two - level atoms .",
    "physically , when two or more atoms are located at a small distance , it is possible to achieve directional scattering through interference between different modes of the electromagnetic field to which the atoms radiate .",
    "many authors have studied the interference effects theoretically  @xcite and also experimentally  @xcite in systems involving few atoms , or composed of a large number of atoms confined to a small volume  @xcite , or configured in a linear chain  @xcite , or self - organized along a waveguide  @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted and experimentally demonstrated that the angular distribution of the emitted radiation depends strongly on the number of atoms and the geometry of the emitting system with emission maxima ( superradiance ) occurring in some directions with an enhanced intensity up to as much @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of atoms in a sample and @xmath2 is the single atom radiation intensity  @xcite . in particular , for a line of atoms , a high focussing of the emission along the line axis can be achieved .",
    "the focusing increases with an increasing number of atoms and also with a decreasing distance between the atoms  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of controlled emissive mode switching and light routing in a system of two two - level atoms .",
    "motivated by the experimental work of shegai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on directional colour routing , we study related effects , namely , we consider a system of two nonidentical two - level atoms separated by an arbitrary distance @xmath3 and investigate how the system when driven by an external laser field could work as an optical nano - antenna for a controlled switching of the emission between different modes and for routing light into a desired direction .",
    "we work in terms of the collective symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the system that have different angular distributions .",
    "we show that the emission can be switched between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes only if the atoms are nonidentical with either different resonance frequencies or unequal damping rates .",
    "the emission can be routed to a desired mode by varying either the ratio of the atomic frequencies or the ratio of the damping rates . in the former ,",
    "the routing is independent of the frequency of the driving laser field , but in the latter it depends strongly on the frequency of the laser .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe in details our model and the geometry of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss in details the method we use to evaluate the intensity of the emitted light . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we derive a general formula for the angular distribution of the emitted radiation .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] provides a simple qualitative explanation of the origin of mode switching and light routing .",
    "the method of calculation of the steady - state values of the density matrix elements is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] , we discuss the angular distribution of the emitted radiation for independent atoms omitting the collective damping and the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we present analytical results for the intensity of the emitted light which clearly demonstrate the effects of mode switching and light routing in the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] , we present numerical results for the angular distribution with the collective damping and the dipole - dipole interaction included .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we consider a system composed of two non - identical closely spaced atoms located along the @xmath4 axis at positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , distant @xmath3 from each other , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the atoms are modelled as two - level systems with transitions occurring only between two non - degenerate energy levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 , having energies @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , and separated by frequency @xmath12 .",
    "we work in the electric dipole approximation that the transitions in the atoms are of the electric dipole type with transition dipole moments @xmath13 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the model is not restricted to only the electric dipole transitions .",
    "it can be extended to any other type of transitions , such as magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole , or two - photon electric dipole transitions .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we close this section with a brief comment about the physical meaning of negative values of the contrast factor @xmath14 . in a paper by mayer and yeoman  @xcite the contrast factor for the symmetric modes was evaluated , which in our notation is @xmath15 the authors have considered a system composed of two identical atoms @xmath16 driven by an incoherent field and simultaneously coupled to a cavity mode , and have found that the factor @xmath14 can have negative values .",
    "the negative values of @xmath14 indicate a minimum of the radiation intensity to occur in the direction normal to the atomic axis .",
    "the fact that  @xmath14 can have negative values was interpreted as `` intrinsically quantum - mechanical effect with no classical analog '' .",
    "we have shown that also the contrast factor of the antisymmetric modes , eq .",
    "( [ e49 ] ) , can have negative values , see figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and  [ fig11 ] .",
    "similarly , it is not difficult to show that for the system considered in the present paper , also the factor ( [ e50 ] ) can have negative values .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows the contrast factor ( [ e50 ] ) for the situation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] of switching the radiation between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is seen that in the case of nonidentical atoms , the factor ( [ e50 ] ) can have negative values and at large detunings  @xmath19 it reaches the optimum negative value @xmath20 . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , at large  @xmath19 the excitation is completely transferred from the the symmetric to the antisymmetric modes .",
    "thus , our results show that  @xmath21 is not an intrinsically nonclassical effect .",
    "it can be interpreted as resulting from a complete transfer of the excitation from the symmetric to the antisymmetric modes that radiate in directions different than normal to the atomic axis .",
    "we have investigated radiative properties of a system composed of two nonidentical two - level atoms , especially to show that the system could work as a nano - antenna for the mode switching and light routing .",
    "we have analysed different contributions to the radiative intensity from the collective states populations and coherences and have found the coherence between the symmetric and antisymmetric states is crucial for the modes switching and light routing .",
    "it has been shown that as long as the atoms are identical , the emission can not be switched between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "the switching may occur when the atoms are nonidentical with either different resonance frequencies or different damping rates . in this case",
    ", the emission can be routed to different modes by changing the relative ratio of the resonance frequencies , or the ratio of the damping rates or by a proper tuning of the laser frequency to the atomic resonance frequencies . in the case of atoms of different resonance frequencies but equal damping rates ,",
    "the light routing is independent of the frequency of the driving laser field .",
    "it depends only on the sign of the detuning between the atomic resonance frequencies . in contrast , if the atoms have different damping rates , the emission direction can be switched between different modes by changing the laser frequency from the blue to red detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "we have also considered the effect of the interatomic interactions , in particular , the dipole - dipole interaction on the feature of light routing .",
    "while the light routing by the system of interacting atoms with different resonance frequencies is quite similar to that of independent atoms , the system of interacting atoms with different damping rates exhibits an interesting feature that the light routing becoming asymmetric under the dipole - dipole interaction with the enhanced emission into modes turned towards the atom of smaller damping  rate .    finally , we would like to point out that most of the results obtained in the present paper are closely related to the results of a recent experiment by shegai _",
