    "the game of cops and robbers , first introduced in  @xcite , has attracted considerable recent interest among graph theorists .",
    "the game is played on a reflexive graph ; that is , each vertex has at least one loop .",
    "multiple edges are allowed , but make no difference to the play of the game , so we always assume there is exactly one edge joining adjacent vertices .",
    "there are two players , consisting of a set of _ cops _ and a single _",
    "robber_. the game is played over a sequence of discrete time - steps or turns , with the cops going first on turn 0 and then playing on alternate time - steps .",
    "we refer to the set of cops as @xmath0 and the robber as @xmath1 . when a player is ready to move in a round they must move to a neighbouring vertex . because of the loops , players can pass , or remain on their own vertices . observe that any subset of @xmath0 may move in a given round .",
    "the cops win if after some finite number of rounds , one of them can occupy the same vertex as the robber ( in a reflexive graph , this is equivalent to the cop landing on the robber ) .",
    "this is called a _ capture_. the robber wins if he can evade capture indefinitely . a",
    "_ winning strategy for the cops _ is a set of rules that if followed , result in a win for the cops .",
    "a _ winning strategy for the robber _ is defined analogously .",
    "the _ cop number _ of a graph , first introduced in @xcite , is the minimum number of cops needed to have a winning strategy .",
    "the cop number is often a challenging graph parameter to analyze , and establishing upper bounds for this parameter is the focus of meyniel s conjecture : the cop number of a connected @xmath2-vertex graph is @xmath3    the _ length _ of a game is the number of rounds it takes ( not including the initial or @xmath4th round ) to capture the robber .",
    "we say that a play of the game with @xmath5 cops is _ optimal _ if its length is the minimum over all possible strategies for the cops , assuming the robber is trying to evade capture for as long as possible ( here @xmath5 denotes the cop number of @xmath6 ) .",
    "if @xmath7 cops play on a graph with @xmath8 , we denote this invariant @xmath9 , which we call the @xmath7-_capture time _ of @xmath6 . in the case",
    "@xmath10 , we just write @xmath11 and refer to this as the _ capture time _ of @xmath6 . note that @xmath9 is trivially @xmath4 if @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the order of @xmath6 ; and @xmath13 if @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the domination number of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the analysis of this invariant can be restricted to the range @xmath16 .",

    "mehrabian  @xcite investigated the capture time of cartesian grids , and proved that if @xmath6 is the cartesian product of two trees , then @xmath23 in particular , the @xmath24-capture time of an @xmath25 cartesian grid is @xmath26 .",

    "we give the asymptotic order of all values of temporal speed - up for grids and hypercubes ( with one small exception in the range of @xmath7 for hypercubes ) .",
    "we analyze temporal speed - up for planar graphs playing with @xmath28 cops , and bounds on the @xmath7-capture time on planar graphs playing with @xmath29 ( which is the upper bound for the cop number of planar graphs ) .",
