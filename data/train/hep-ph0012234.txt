    "in this talk we discuss two topics . we demonstrate how to calculate the cross section for process @xmath0 near threshold for nnlo accuracy and discuss a top quark mass definition adequate for the threshold .    top quark physics will be one of the main subjects of studies at future @xmath3 and @xmath4 colliders such as the next linear collider ( nlc )  @xcite and the future muon collider ( fmc ) .",
    "the goals are to measure and to determine the properties of the top quark which was first discovered at the tevatron  @xcite with a mass of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "although the top quark will be studied at the lhc and the tevatron ( run - ii ) with an expected accuracy for the mass of @xmath6 , the _ most accurate measurement _ of the mass with an accuracy of @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) is expected to be obtained only at the nlc  @xcite .",
    "the top quark mass enters the relation between the electroweak precision observables indirectly through loops effects .",
    "the global electro - weak fit of the standard model requires to have very accurate input data in order to make a constraint for the masses of undiscovered particles , such as the higgs boson or other particles .",
    "in addition we can study possible deviations from the standard model through anomalous couplings , cp violation , or extra dimensions .",
    "due to the large top quark width ( @xmath8 ) , the top - antitop pair can not hadronize into toponium resonances .",
    "the cross section therefore appears to have a smooth line - shape showing only a moderate @xmath9 peak .",
    "in addition the top quark width serves as an infrared cutoff and as a natural smearing over the energy . as a result ,",
    "the nonperturbative qcd effects induced by the gluon condensate are small @xcite , allowing us to calculate the cross section with high accuracy by using perturbative qcd even in the threshold region .",
    "many theoretical studies at lo and nlo have been done in the past , and recently for the nnlo as well .",
    "the results of the nnlo analysis are summarized in a review article  @xcite . to summarize the results for a standard approach using the pole mass , the nnlo corrections are uncomfortably large , spoiling the possibility for the top quark mass extraction at nlc with good accuracy because the @xmath9 peak is shifted by about @xmath10 by the nnlo , the last known correction .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is the usage of the pole mass in the calculations .",
    "it was realized that such type of instability is caused by the fact that the pole mass is a badly defined object within full qcd . for more details",
    "we also refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider the cross section of the process @xmath0 in the near threshold region where the velocity @xmath11 of the top quark is small .",
    "it is well - known that the conventional perturbative expansion does not work in the non - relativistic region because of the presence of the coulomb singularities at small velocities @xmath12 .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath13 appear due to the instantaneous coulomb interaction between the top and the antitop quark .",
    "the standard technique for re - summing the terms @xmath13 consists in using the schrdinger equation for the coulomb potential to find the green function .",
    "the total cross section can then be related to the green function by using the optical theorem , @xmath14\\bigg|_{r_0\\to 0}\\ ] ] where the green function @xmath15 satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath16 an obstacle for a straightforward calculation at nnlo are the uv divergences coming from relativistic corrections to the coulomb potential ( the so - called breit - fermi potential ) .",
    "this problem can be solved by a proper factorization of the amplitudes and by employing effective theories ( see for the review @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 can be fixed by using a direct qcd calculation of the vector vertex at nnlo in the so - called intermediate region  @xcite and by using the direct matching procedure suggested in ref .",
    "in addition , the non - factorizable corrections cancel in the total cross section but modify the differential one @xcite . for the numerical solution of the final equation we used the program derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by one of the authors .",
    "the top quark mass is an input parameter of the standard model .",
    "although it is widely accepted that the quark masses are generated due to the higgs mechanism , the value of the mass can not be calculated from the standard model . instead",
    ", quark masses have to be determined from the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "there is no unique definition of the quark mass . because the quark can not be observed as a free particle like the electron , the quark mass is a purely theoretical notion and depends on the concept adopted for its definition .",
    "the best known definitions are the pole mass and the @xmath18 mass . however , both definitions are not adequate for the analysis of top quark production near threshold .",
    "the pole mass should not be used because it has the renormalon ambiguity and can not be determined more accurately than @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 mass is an euclidean mass , defined at high virtuality , and therefore destroys the non - relativistic expansion .",
    "instead , it was recently suggested to use threshold masses .",
    "there are many such definitions : the low scale ( ls ) mass  @xcite , the potential subtracted ( ps ) mass  @xcite , and one half of the perturbative mass of a fictitious @xmath21 ground state ( called @xmath9 mass )  @xcite .",
    "all of them could be used in application but have to be related to the fixed notation , e.g.  the @xmath20 mass .",
    "we suggest a new definition which we think is more physically motivated .",
    "the objectives in defining such a mass are that the mass should be `` short distance '' , being free from soft qcd effects and adequate for the threshold calculations .",
    "furthermore , the definition should be gauge independent and well - defined within quantum field theory so that radiative and relativistic corrections can be calculated in a systematic way .",
    "our definition given in  @xcite is @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the soft part of the heavy quark self energy which is defined as the part where at least one of the heavy quark propagators is on - shell . summarizing all contribution up to nnlo accuracy , we obtain for the difference @xmath25",
    "@xcite @xmath26 where the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath29 is the pole mass , @xmath30 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath31 is the factorization scale . we have calculated the coefficients to higher orders in @xmath32 which are explicitly given in eq .",
    "( [ psmass ] ) and which are recoil corrections to the previous one .",
    "remark that there is no contribution of the leading order to @xmath32 .",
    "our result can be represented in a condensed form as @xmath33 where the first term @xmath34 is the static coulomb potential , @xmath35 is the relativistic correction ( which is related to the breit - fermi potential but does not coincide with it ) , and @xmath36 is the non - abelian correction . using three - loop relations between the pole mass and the @xmath20 mass given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we fix the @xmath20 mass to take the values @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and determine the pole mass at lo , nlo , and nnlo . this pole mass is then used as input parameter @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ psmass ] ) to determine the ps and @xmath1 masses at lo , nlo , and nnlo .",
    "the obtained values for the ps and @xmath1 mass differ only in nnlo .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the results of the analysis of the cross section .",
    "the triple of curves indicates different values for the renormalization scale , shown for lo ( dashed - dotted ) , nlo ( dashed ) , and nnlo ( solid ) .",
    "it is obvious that in using the @xmath1 mass ( as well as the other threshold masses ) we gain a remarkable improvement of the stability in going from lo to nlo to nnlo ( shifts are below @xmath40 ) .",
    "this understanding removes one of the obstacles for an accurate top mass measurement and one can expect that the top quark mass will be extracted from a threshold scan at nlc with an accuracy of about @xmath41 .",
