    "the study of doped antiferromagnets has become a central topic in the area of strongly correlated electrons systems , mainly after anderson s proposition@xcite about the probable existence of non - fermi liquid behavior once a mott insulating state is hole - doped . a valuable experiment that gives access to single - particle properties of many - electron systems",
    "is the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . even though in the last years there has been a rapid pace of developments in arpes experiments , there are still controversies in many strongly interacting cases , like the cuprates , where the difficulty to distinguish a coherent @xmath4-function peak from an incoherent part of the spectra does not allow a proper interpretation of the available data@xcite .",
    "a useful microscopic model widely used to describe the low - energy physics involved in photoemission experiments of antiferromagnetic mott insulators@xcite is the @xmath0 model on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "attention has also been concentrated on triangular mott insulators .",
    "these systems are attractive due to the presence of both , strong correlation and geometrical magnetic frustration , leading to non - conventional behavior .",
    "experimental realizations of such systems are @xmath5@xcite , the @xmath6 family of the organic charge transfer salts @xmath7 @xcite , and the silicon surfaces k / si ( 111):b and sic(0001)@xcite . in a recent publication , koretsune and",
    "ogata@xcite have studied the effect of finite doping in the triangular heisenberg model .",
    "they found that a resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) ground state is favored when @xmath2 is positive , while a nagaoka s ferromagnetic ground state is stabilized for negative @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , the role of the @xmath2 sign and frustration has been addressed in the superconductor @xmath8 where the @xmath9 atoms form the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "these remarkable issues lead us to investigate the spectral function of a hole in a triangular mott insulator , so as to analize the consequences of the geometrical frustration and the @xmath2 sign on the hole motion .",
    "in particular , our aim is to study the existence of quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations and higher - energy features in the spectral functions . to this purpose , we focus on the hole dynamics in the triangular @xmath0 model , and we solve it using the lanczos exact diagonalization method and the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) . in the non - frustrated case , it is known that the scba reproduces quite well the exact diagonalization results on small clusters@xcite and the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite . in particular , the scba predicts the existence of a well defined quasiparticle peak ( magnetic polaron ) at low energies for the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "furthermore , the scba is able to capture finite lifetime resonances above the qp peaks .",
    "these resonances have been explained by the string picture since their energies scale as @xmath3 , as it happens in the ising limit . in our triangular frustrated case ,",
    "the presence of the @xmath10 nel order generates two mechanisms for hole motion in the scba effective hamiltonian , one being tight - binding like ( or free ) and the other , magnon - assisted .",
    "we will show that the @xmath2 sign tunes the interference between both mechanisms , producing pronounced differences in the low energy as well as in the higher energy region of the spectral functions .",
    "for the strong coupling regime , we find an excellent agreement between the scba and the exact results on a 21 sites cluster . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the scba spectral functions present a rich structure .",
    "notably , for @xmath11 a quasiparticle excitation is always defined for all @xmath12 of the brillouin zone , while for @xmath13 in the strong coupling regime the quasiparticle signal survives only around the goldstone magnetic wave vectors . by computing the quasiparticle energy scaling with @xmath14 it is possible to get some insight of the magnetic cloud surrounding the hole@xcite .",
    "we argue that for @xmath15 the local environment around the hole enhances its af character , while for @xmath16 the ferromagnetic character is favored .",
    "we find that the single - hole dynamics in the thermodynamic limit behaves in the opposite way as in very small clusters , like the three - sites problem@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for small values of @xmath14 and @xmath17 , higher energy resonances above the quasiparticle peak appear showing a @xmath3 energy scaling . although the triangular @xmath18 model is completely different to the square lattice case , we continue identifying these resonances with string - like excitations . for @xmath19 , instead , we do not observe higher energy resonances that can be identified with strings .",
    "this behavior observed at higher energies can be also traced back to the particular features of the magnetic environment around the hole mentioned above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we obtain the effective hamiltonian and the one hole properties within the scba . in section iii we present the results : ( iiia ) the comparison between exact and scba results in finite size clusters , ( iiib ) the quasiparticle features , and ( iiic ) the general description of the spectral functions . finally , in section iv we draw the concluding remarks .",
    "the @xmath0 model is defined as @xmath20    where the first term represents the hopping between nearest neighbors ( @xmath21 ) of the triangular lattice , with the constraint of no double occupancy , @xmath22 ) , and the second term represents the antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg part with @xmath23 .",
    "the study of the single hole motion in an af requires a correct description of the magnetic low energy sector since the injected hole will couple strongly with these spin excitations . in the literature",
    "there is firm numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite evidence that the triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet has a @xmath24 nel order ground state , and that spin wave theory reproduces quite well its low energy behavior@xcite .",
    "so that , we assume an ordered ground state with a magnetic wave vector @xmath25 lying in the @xmath26 plane , and spin waves as the low energy excitations . in order to simplify the calculation",
    "we perform a unitary transformation to local spin quantization axis primed operators in order to have a ferromagnetic ground state in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "then , we use the spinless fermion representation for electrons @xmath28 and the holstein - primakov representation for spin operators ( to order @xmath29 ) @xmath30 , where @xmath31 creates a spinless hole at site @xmath32 , and @xmath33 creates a spin deviation .",
    "we replace the above expresions in eq .",
    "( [ tj ] ) and , after fourier and bogoliubov transformations , the effective hamiltonian results @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath35 and @xmath36 the bare hole and magnon dispersions , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the bare hole - magnon vertex interaction with the geometric factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 s are the positive vectors to nearest neighbors ) , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the usual boguliubov coefficients . in the hamiltonian ( [ hsw ] ) constant terms related to",
    "magnetic energy are omitted the free hopping hole term implies a finite probability of the hole to move without emission or absorption of magnons .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the underlying _ non - collinear _ magnetic structure .",
    "the hole - magnon interaction adds another mechanism for the charge carrier motion which is magnon - assisted .",
    "the latter is responsible for the spin - polaron formation when a hole is injected in a non - frustrated antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "we will show the existence of a subtle interference between both processes that turns out to be dependent on the @xmath2 sign .",
    "an important quantity that allows us to study the interplay between such processes is the retarded hole green function that is defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the undoped antiferromagnetic ground state with a @xmath10 nel order . in the scba @xmath44 is the spin wave af ground state , and after neglection of the crossing diagrams , the dyson s equation for the self energy at zero temperature results @xmath45 we have solved numerically this self - consistent equation for @xmath46 , and calculated the hole spectral function @xmath47 and the quasiparticle ( qp ) weight @xmath48 where the qp energy is given by @xmath49 .",
    "we have computed the one hole spectral function @xmath50 using the lanczos exact diagonalization method ( ed ) and the scba on finite size clusters . to test the reliability of the scba predictions",
    "we have compared both techniques on the @xmath51 sites cluster , which preserves the spatial symmetries of the infinite triangular lattice@xcite . in general , we have found a good agreement between ed and scba results for all momenta of the bz and for @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the spectral functions at three representative @xmath53 points of the bz ( see inset fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in the strong coupling regime , @xmath54 , and for both signs of the transfer integral @xmath2 .     and @xmath55 for momenta @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath12 shown as filled circles in the inset ( the crosses represent the other momenta ) .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panel displays the results for positive ( negative ) @xmath2 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the exact and scba results , respectively . @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 has been used.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the exact structure of the spectral functions strongly depends on the momentum because the hole strongly scatter off antiferromagnetic fluctuations@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the geometrical frustration is manifested in a marked dependence of the spectral function with the @xmath2 sign .",
    "remarkably , the scba reproduces very well these exact results in the whole range of energies . in some cases from the scale of the figure",
    "it can not be clearly distinguished a quasiparticle peak at low energies . by decreasing @xmath60",
    "appropriately we have checked , however , the existence of a qp peak for all @xmath53 of the bz . in particular , for negative ( positive ) @xmath2 the @xmath61",
    "( @xmath62 ) point becomes the momentum of the quasiparticle ground state .",
    "the energy of the hole can be splitted in two contributions : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the energy of the localized hole , and @xmath65 is the energy gain due to delocalization of the hole@xcite . as the scba does not take into account the localized hole energy we have shifted the exact energy spectra by an amount @xmath66 for @xmath55 in order to make a proper comparison with the scba results .",
    "the agreement between both techniques is similar to that found in the @xmath67 square lattice besides the presence of stronger antiferromagnetic fluctuations in our frustrated case .",
    "it was shown that this agreement is a consequence of the small leading nonzero contribution to the self energy from the crossing diagrams@xcite .",
    "the momentum and the @xmath2 sign dependence of the spectra aforementioned is strengthened in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , we observe important differences in the quasiparticle weight @xmath68 through the bz under the change of @xmath2 sign .",
    "using lattice sizes up to @xmath69 we have extrapolated the results to the thermodynamic limit . in fig.[fig2 ] we show the values of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath14 for representative points along high symmetry axes of the bz .    .",
    "upper ( lower ) panel is for @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the location of the @xmath70 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the most salient feature we have obtained is the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight at some momenta for positive @xmath2 . at the @xmath71 and @xmath72 points @xmath73 below @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing the robustness and then the rapid decay to zero of @xmath76 as @xmath77 .",
    "a similar behavior has the qp signal at @xmath78 , the ground state momentum , but it goes to zero only when @xmath79 . finally , the qp signal is very weak , but finite , at the magnetic wave vector @xmath80 for all the @xmath14 range studied ; for instance , @xmath81 when @xmath82 .",
    "surprisingly , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 does not seem to approach one as it turns out in the square lattice case@xcite .",
    "the non existence of quasi - particle excitations is a striking manifestation of the strong interference between the free and magnon - assisted hopping processes , tuned by the @xmath2 sign . for the strong coupling regime and a large region of the bz ,",
    "the coherence of the qp is lost because of the quite different group velocities of the spin fluctuation and the tight binding hole motion , suggesting the likelihood of a spin - charge separation scenario@xcite for the triangular @xmath85 model .     and positive @xmath2.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    on the other hand , for negative @xmath2",
    "the quasiparticle weight is finite for all momenta and for @xmath86 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one found in the non - frustrated case @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that now the qp ground state momentum is @xmath71 ( @xmath80 ) for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the spectral weight of the qp becomes the most robust for the ground state momenta .",
    "the interchange in the @xmath12 dependence of the qp weight , evidenced in a comparison between both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , could be thought as a remnant of the particle - hole symmetry that shifts the momenta by @xmath89 under @xmath2 sign reversal .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the shaded areas correspond to the regions where the qp weight is finite for @xmath90 and positive @xmath2 .",
    "there is no qp signal for momenta outside the neighborhood of the magnetic goldstone modes ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the presence of qp signal in the non - equivalent vertices of the bz is an artifact of the used approximation : the spin wave magnetic ground state has a definite chirality ( @xmath92 ) , but our vertex interaction does not discriminate between @xmath93 , resulting the whole spectral function degenerate in both momenta.the shaded areas share the same symmetries with the triangular magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "we have noted that as @xmath94 they shrink to the magnetic goldstones modes .",
    "conversely , when @xmath95 there is a finite qp weight anywhere and therefore , the full bz becomes shaded .",
    "for the particular value @xmath96 , the qp weight vanishes only around the @xmath71 point , as it is displayed by the solid line of fig .",
    "this figure also shows the strong @xmath12 dependence of the qp weight for both @xmath2 signs .",
    "again , a signature of the remnant particle - hole symmetry mentioned above is evidenced : the dashed line ( @xmath15 ) resembles the solid one ( @xmath16 ) shifted by the wave vector @xmath89 .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) solid line is for positive @xmath2 and dashed line for negative @xmath2 . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in a previous work the hole dynamics in a triangular antiferromagnet has already been studied using the scba @xcite , but the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight for positive @xmath2 has been overlooked .",
    "our findings , however , are supported by a detailed and careful treatment of the parameters involved : the convergence factor @xmath97 , the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit of the cluster sizes @xmath98 , and the number of frequencies @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "points of the brilluoin zone for @xmath90 and negative @xmath2.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by computing the quasiparticle energy scaling with @xmath14 it is possible to get some insight of the magnetic cloud surrounding the hole@xcite .",
    "it is known that for a ferromagnetic polaron the qp energy scales as @xmath100 , while for an af polaron it follows a @xmath101 dependence . in our case",
    "we have estimated a @xmath102 scaling , being @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath2 in the range @xmath105 .",
    "a possible interpretation of such results is the following : the non - collinear short range magnetic correlations around the hole can be thought as a superposition of ferro and af correlations , and then for @xmath15 the local environment around the hole enhances its af character , while for @xmath16 the ferromagnetic character is favored .",
    "it should be noticed that the opposite behavior holds in a simple toy model consisting of a three - sites @xmath85 model with one hole@xcite .",
    "actually , we have checked that for cluster sizes smaller than @xmath55 , this behavior is reversed .",
    "for instance , for @xmath106 , @xmath107 for positive @xmath2 while for negative @xmath2 it turns out @xmath108 .      in this section",
    "we discuss the main features of the spectral functions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the arising structures can be traced back to the two hole motion processes present in the effective hamiltonian ( [ hsw ] ) .",
    "the spectral functions at the @xmath78 , @xmath72 , @xmath80 and @xmath71 points are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath90 and negative @xmath2 .",
    "the spectra extend over a frequency range of order @xmath109 ; that is , the non - interacting electronic energy scale .",
    "it is possible to discern two distinct regions : a low energy sector of magnetic origin ( magnon - assisted ) , and a high energy sector with a broad resonance related to the free hopping process .",
    "this resonance , located at an energy near @xmath110 , has a finite lifetime of order @xmath111 and a dispersion of order @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the low energy sector consists of a quasiparticle peak and higher energy resonances with a narrow dispersion of order @xmath112 as the momentun varies .",
    "we will show below that the latter resonances can be identified with string excitations . at @xmath78 and @xmath72 both sectors",
    "are well separated in energy , while at @xmath80 and @xmath71 they overlap . from @xmath78 to @xmath71",
    "there is a spectral weight transfer from the high energy sector to the qp peak as it can be also noticed quantitatively in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the magnetic resonances above the qp peak for @xmath113 ( at the ground state momentum @xmath71 ) .",
    "we choose this particular parameter value in order to make them more visible , although they are clearly noticeable for @xmath114 . in the inset",
    "it is shown the energies of the first three resonances _ versus _ @xmath3 .",
    "the linear dependence of their energies allow us to associate these resonances with string excitations of a hole confined by an effective linear potential of order @xmath112@xcite .",
    "as we have previously stated , there is a dynamical enhancement of the af environment around the hole when @xmath2 is negative , and this effect is the responsible for the strong confining potential seen by the hole , like in the square lattice case .     point for @xmath113 and negative @xmath2 .",

    "this result is a manifestation of the ferromagnetic - like environment around the hole , pointed out before , for this @xmath2 sign .",
    "again the high energy sector has a broad bandwith of order @xmath115 .",
    "it is important to notice that at the ground state momentum @xmath78 the qp is very robust , being the only relevant feature of the spectral function .",
    "otherwise , at @xmath72 and @xmath71 the spectral functions are almost structureless .",

    "we have studied the effect of geometrical frustration on a single hole moving in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "we chose the triangular @xmath0 model which at half filling presents a non - collinear magnetic ground state . using the spinless fermion representation and the self - consistent born approximation we derived an effective hamiltonian with two different hole motion mechanisms .",
    "one of them arises due to spin - flip processes ( magnon - assisted ) and the other one has its origin from the ferromagnetic components of the non - collinear magnetic order .",
    "the latter allows the free hole motion without emission or absorption of magnons and it is absent in collinear antiferromagnets .",
    "the reliability of the analytical method ( scba ) is supported by the excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization method on small size clusters .    unlike previous works@xcite",
    ", we have performed a detailed description of the whole structures of the spectral function and we were able to trace them back to the two hole motion processes mentioned above .",
    "in particular , we have done a careful analysis of quasiparticles , strings , and free hole resonances in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have found new and reliable results of the low energy sector of the spectra .",
    "our main result is the vanishing of the quasiparticle excitation for a _ positive _ integral transfer @xmath2 at some momenta and at finite @xmath112 .",
    "also , we have uncovered other important change of the spectra under @xmath2 sign reversal : the presence of string - like excitations only for @xmath2 negative .",
    "we suggest that these features are a consequence of different magnetic environment around the hole tuned by the @xmath2 sign .",
    "based on the quasiparticle energy scaling with @xmath14 , we argue that for negative @xmath2 the local environment around the hole enhances its af character , while for the other sign the ferromagnetic character is favored . for small clusters ( @xmath116 ) , this behavior is reversed , in agreement with the three - sites problem worked out by koretsune and ogata.@xcite a deeper study of the magnetic environment using the hole wave function within the scba will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a hole in the triangular lattice , for negative @xmath2 , exhibits the same features of the well known square lattice case@xcite : a well defined quasiparticle , string excitations , and antiferromagnetic correlations around the hole . on the contrary , for positive",
    "@xmath2 the dynamics is more irregular : no well defined quasiparticle , no string excitations , and ferromagnetic correlations around the hole .    for decades",
    "researchers have tried to look for spin - liquid phases that upon hole doping , give rise to non - conventional excitations@xcite .",
    "now we give firm evidence that such non - conventional excitations can be found in _ non - collinear _ spin - crystal phases like the one present in the triangular antiferromagnet .",
