    "recent high  precision observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite together with high redshift supernovae surveys @xcite , observations of large scale structure @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite have provided strong evidence that the universe is at present undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "such an accelerating phase poses a serious problem for cosmology since it is difficult to explain within the usual general relativistic framework .",
    "phenomenologically , the simplest way to generate such an accelerating phase is through the addition of a cosmological constant to the einstein s field equations . at a more fundamental level",
    ", however , the problem is how to account for such a constant within a candidate theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this has motivated a large number of alternative models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these models can mostly be divided into two broad groups : those involving an exotic matter source and those modifying the gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "an important subset of the latter are the so called generalised gravity theories , based on non - linear lagrangians of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath10 is a general differentiable function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "such modifications to the ( linear ) einstein - hilbert action typically arise in effective actions derived from string / m - theory @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches that may be taken in studying generalised @xmath0 theories of gravity , depending upon the choice of the independent fields with respect to which the action is varied . in the first ( ` metric ' approach ) only variations with respect to the metric are considered , whereas in the second ( ` palatini ' approach ) the action is varied with respect to both the metric and connection .",
    "both approaches result in identical field equations for the case of linear einstein - hilbert action . in the more general cases , with nonlinear lagrangians @xmath0 ,",
    "however , the metric approach results in fourth - order field equations , whereas the palatini variation generates a second - order system . in this paper we consider both approaches .    recently a number of @xmath0 models have been proposed in order to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe . given the large number of such models that have been ( or can potentially be ) considered , an urgent task at present is to devise stringent tests in order to reduce the viable range of candidates .",
    "in addition to constraints obtained by demanding the stability of the models , we require the models to be consistent with constraints from background cosmological dynamics @xcite , as well as from local gravity constraints ( lgc ) @xcite .",
    "generally , models put forward to explain the late - time acceleration involve infra - red corrections to hilbert action with negative powers of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the viability of such models can depend upon which formalism is used in order to derive them . as an example consider the model @xmath11 with @xmath12 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the metric approach",
    "this model is problematic because of the absence of the matter era @xcite as well as the instability of perturbations associated with negative @xmath13 @xcite , where comma denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover it does not satisfy the lgc @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the palatini approach the background cosmological dynamics successfully generates a standard matter era followed by a late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "one can also realise a correct newtonian limit in the regime where @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath14 @xcite . for",
    "the study of cosmological and local gravitational constraints for a range of @xmath0 models , see refs .",
    "@xcite in the metric case and refs .",
    "@xcite in the palatini case .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 theories that satisfy both cosmological and local gravity constraints in the metric approach .",
    "despite the importance of above constraints in limiting the range of viable models , it is well known that the study of the homogeneous dynamics is not sufficient on its own to determine the nature of the underlying theory uniquely , given that @xmath0 theories can always be expressed in terms of a conventional relativistic cosmology sourced by a perfect fluid with an effective equation of state .",
    "an important way to break this degeneracy is by considering the evolution of density perturbations about the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker background .",
    "the study of perturbations provides an important tool in order to break this degeneracy as well as allowing more stringent constraints to be placed on the parameters of the models .",
    "in fact a number of authors recently studied the evolution of density perturbations for some @xmath0 models to put constraints on model parameters in metric @xcite and palatini @xcite formalisms .    here , with this aim in mind , we study the evolution of density perturbations and resulting observational consequences in both metric and palatini formalisms .",
    "we first write the equations without specifying any gauges and then write them in a number of gauges ( including comoving , longitudinal and uniform density gauges ) from which we derive the corresponding approximate perturbation equations under sub - horizon type approximations .",
    "in the metric approach where the oscillating mode ( referred to as the scalaron , see below ) @xcite is present , this approximation can be invalid if the scalaron is overproduced in the early universe .",
    "however , as long as the scalaron is sub - dominant relative to a matter induced mode , we shall show that approximate perturbation equations can be valid even for super - hubble modes in the models that satisfy lgc .",
    "the approximation is especially reliable in the palatini case because of the absence of scalarons .",
    "the simplicity of the equations derived facilitate the estimation of the growth rate of perturbations both analytically and numerically .    using these equations",
    "we make a comparative study of the behaviour of matter density perturbations in both formalisms , for a number of classes of theories satisfying lgc as well as background constraints .",
    "these include viable theories recently proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "an important quantity to characterise the growth rate of matter perturbations is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density contrast on orthogonal comoving hypersurfaces and a prime represents a derivative with respect to the number of e - foldings . in the standard general relativistic ( gr ) case @xmath17 .    in the metric formalism",
    ", the growth rate in the non - standard regime where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the scale factor and @xmath20 is the comoving wave number ) is given by @xmath21 .",
    "while this is within the current observational bound @xmath22 , the difference between spectral indices of the matter power spectrum and the cmb spectrum can provide stronger constraints . in the palatini case , when @xmath23 , the growth rate @xmath24 grows exponentially once the universe enters the regime @xmath25 .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath4 can be severely constrained using the information from the bounds on @xmath24 . in this paper",
    "we shall obtain constraints on the present value of the deviation parameter @xmath4 as well as model parameters for a number of @xmath0 theories that include most essential features required by viable models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we give a brief review of constraints for @xmath0 theories in both metric and palatini formalisms provided by background cosmological evolution and local gravity constraints . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we give a brief account of metric perturbations and matter density perturbations which are applicable to both metric and palatini formalisms . in sections",
    "[ s4 ] and [ s5 ] we derive the evolution equations for matter density perturbations in metric and palatini formalisms respectively and in each case discuss the constraints they provide by considering a number of theories that are viable according to background cosmological and local gravity constraints .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ s6 ] .    in",
    "what follows we shall use units such that @xmath26 , but we restore bare gravitational constant @xmath27 when it is needed .",
    "the classes of @xmath0 general gravity theories we consider have actions of the form : @xmath28 where @xmath10 is a general differentiable function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 and @xmath29 corresponds to a matter action , which depends upon the metric @xmath30 and matter fields @xmath31 .",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath1 is defined by @xmath32 , where the ricci tensor @xmath33 is @xmath34 in the case of the metric formalism , the connections @xmath35 are the usual metric connections defined in terms of the metric tensor @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath30 to give @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "( [ bd1])-([bd2 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ metba1])-([metba2 ] ) , it can readily be seen that the @xmath0 theories in the metric formalism correspond to the above generalised brans - dicke - type theories with @xmath55 .",
    "similarly the @xmath0 theories in the palatini formalism correspond to the brans - dicke - type theories with @xmath56 .",
    "the newtonian effective gravitational constant in the brans - dicke theory ( [ action2 ] ) can be derived under a weak - field approximation by considering a spherically symmetric body with a mass @xmath57 , constant density @xmath58 and a radius @xmath59 and a vanishing density ( @xmath60 ) outside the body .",
    "decomposing the field @xmath46 into background and perturbation parts ( @xmath61 ) and using a linear perturbation theory in the minkowski background with a perturbation @xmath62 , the effective gravitational constant is given by @xcite : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a distance from the center of the body and the scalar field mass squared is defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a local field in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we should emphasise here that the expression ( [ effectiveg - m ] ) is only valid subject to @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "if the scalar field mass @xmath68 is large , it can happen that the condition for the linear perturbation theory ( @xmath69 ) becomes invalid .",
    "moreover , this validity depends on the distribution of scalar field mass inside and outside the body .",
    "when the mass in the region @xmath70 is much larger than the corresponding mass in the region @xmath71 , a thin - shell can be formed inside the body to satisfy local gravity constraints through a chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "the formation of the thin - shell occurs in a non - linear region in which the above linear result ( [ effectiveg - m ] ) ceases to be valid @xcite .    an important point to note here",
    "is that the palatini case , corresponding to @xmath56 , is rather special in a number of fundamental ways .",
    "for example , the @xmath46 field kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ bd2 ] ) vanishes in this case , whereas it is non - zero in the metric case with @xmath72 .",
    "as we shall see below this has the important consequence that the oscillatory scalaron mode is absent in @xmath0 theories based on the palatini formalism , whereas it is present in all other models with @xmath73 , including @xmath0 theories based on the metric formalism .",
    "also the scalar field mass @xmath68 blows up for finite potential - dependent terms in the parenthesis of eq .",
    "( [ masssq ] ) as @xmath49 approaches @xmath74 . for the theories with @xmath73 , the scalar field mediates a fifth force with an interaction range @xmath75 because the field has a kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ bd2 ] ) . in the palatini formalism",
    "the field lacks a kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ bd2 ] ) , which implies that the notion of the usual interaction range determined by mass @xmath68 does not hold .",
    "thus the palatini case should be treated separately compared to other theories .    in the usual brans - dicke theory with @xmath50 and @xmath73",
    ", the mass @xmath68 vanishes because the field @xmath46 propagates freely .",
    "then the yukawa - correction term @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ effectiveg - m ] ) becomes one , in which case the brans - dicke parameter @xmath49 is constrained by local gravity experiments to be larger than @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this constraint does not , however , necessarily apply to @xmath0 gravity theories , because the presence of the potential @xmath47 can make such theories compatible with local gravity constraints under certain conditions ( which we shall see later ) .    before proceeding to consider matter density perturbations and the constraints arising from them , we shall first briefly review the cosmological and local gravity constraints for @xmath0 theories in both formalisms . the constraints from background dynamics have been studied in both metric @xcite and palatini @xcite formalisms . to discuss these constraints ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the following dimensionless parameters @xcite @xmath78 in the metric case insight into the cosmological dynamics can be obtained by considering trajectories in the @xmath79 plane . in the palatini case it is more convenient to use other dimensionless variables for the background dynamics @xcite , but",
    "the deviation parameter @xmath4 is still important in order to characterise the deviation from the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "we first review the cosmological viability in the metric case and then proceed to consider the lgc . in the @xmath80 plane",
    "the matter point corresponds to @xmath81 . in order to have a saddle matter era followed by a late - time acceleration",

    "they are stable provided that @xmath85 as long as conditions ( [ con0met ] ) and ( [ con2met ] ) are satisfied , we can realize a successful cosmological sequence ( radiation , matter , and de - sitter epochs ) .",
    "there are a number of models in the recent literature that satisfy the above cosmological constraints .",
    "examples are ( i ) @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite , and ( ii ) @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite . for these models , the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath92 satisfy the relation @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a positive constant in the neighbourhood of @xmath95 .",
    "using observational constraints on the background dynamics from sn ia and the sound horizon of cmb , the parameter @xmath4 has been shown to be constrained to be @xmath96  @xcite .    if the information from lgc is also included the constraints on the model parameters become very strong .",
    "the usual procedure to determine the local gravity constraints for @xmath0 theories is to consider their brans - dicke representations ( [ phidef ] ) and expand the equations of motion around a background minkowski metric @xcite . since the metric formalism corresponds to @xmath72 , the scalar field mass defined in eq .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that , when @xmath301 , the evolution of perturbations mimics that in general relativity .",
    "after the universe enters the regime @xmath305 , the modes are inside the hubble radius due to the fact that the condition @xmath668 is required for the compatibility with lgc .",

    "the quantity @xmath4 is constrained to be very much smaller than the order of unity during the matter era from lgc , but it can grow to the order of 0.1 around the present epoch . in the palatini formalism , lgc and background cosmological constraints do not place strong bounds on @xmath4 ( only requiring @xmath676 ) , but the density perturbations can provide stringent constraints : @xmath8-@xmath9 .",

    "<S> we make a detailed study of matter density perturbations in both metric and palatini formalisms . </S>",
    "<S> considering general theories whose lagrangian density is a general function , @xmath0 , of the ricci scalar @xmath1 , we derive the equation of matter density perturbations in each case , in a number of gauges , including comoving , longitudinal and uniform density gauges . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for viable @xmath0 models that satisfy cosmological and local gravity constraints ( lgc ) , matter perturbation equations derived under a sub - horizon approximation are valid even for super - hubble scales provided the oscillating mode ( scalaron ) does not dominate over the matter - induced mode . </S>",
    "<S> such approximate equations are especially reliable in the palatini formalism because of the absence of scalarons .    </S>",
    "<S> using these equations we make a comparative study of the behaviour of matter density perturbations as well as gravitational potentials for a number of classes of @xmath0 theories . in the metric formalism </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath2 that characterises the deviation from the @xmath3cdm model is constrained to be very small during a matter era in order to ensure compatibility with lgc , but the models in which @xmath4 grows to the order of @xmath5 around the present epoch can be allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these models also suffer from an additional fine tuning due to the presence of scalaron oscillating modes which are absent in the palatini case .    in palatini formalism lgc and background cosmological constraints </S>",
    "<S> provide only weak bounds on @xmath6 by constraining it to be smaller than @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to matter density perturbations which , on galactic scales , place far more stringent constraints on the present deviation parameter @xmath4 of the order of @xmath8@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the peculiar evolution of matter perturbations in the palatini case which exhibits a rapid growth or a damped oscillation depending on the sign of @xmath4 . </S>"
