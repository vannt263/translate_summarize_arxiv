    "a major recent development in extragalactic astronomy is the discovery that most of the spheroids in the local universe contain a super - massive black hole ( bh ; e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "the masses of these monsters are tightly correlated to the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulges ( e.g. ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that the formation and evolution of spheroids and the build - up of the super - massive bhs at their centres are interconnected .",
    "this interplay may hold the key for understanding some of the observed trends in galaxy evolution .",
    "one of the fundamental properties of galaxies is their bimodal distribution in rest - frame colour .",
    "this bimodality is observed to beyond redshift @xmath4 and is believed to hold important clues on galaxy assembly ( e.g. strateva et al .",
    "2001 ; baldry et al . 2004 ; bell et al . 2004 ; weiner et al . 2005 ; cirasuolo et al . 2007 ) . evolved spheroidal galaxies are found in the `` red - cloud '' of the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , star - forming systems define the `` blue cloud '' , while the region between these overdensities is sparsely populated .",
    "this bimodal distribution is likely to be the combined result of evolution effects and external factors such as interactions and mergers ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 , 2006a , 2006b ; blanton 2006 ) .",
    "in the simplest interpretation , the cmd is consistent with a picture where the galaxy star - formation is truncated , by a mechanism that remains to be identified , leading to the ageing of the stellar population and the rapid transition from the blue to the red cloud .",
    "agn are proposed to play a major part in this process by regulating the star - formation in galaxies causing their transition in colour or maintaining them in the red cloud .",
    "modelling work indeed suggests that the energy released by agn is sufficient to either heat up or blow away the cold gas of galaxies ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; king 2003 ) , irreversibly altering their evolution .",
    "two main routes are proposed by which agn feedback affects the host galaxy .",
    "the first one operates during the luminous and high accretion rate stage of bh growth , which is suggested to occur during major mergers ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005 , 2006a , b ) .",
    "these catastrophic events also produce nuclear starbursts that obscure the central engine for most of its active lifetime .",
    "when the agn becomes sufficiently luminous it drives outflows , which sweep away the nuclear gas and dust clouds , thereby quenching the nuclear star - formation . following this stage",
    ", the agn also declines as the bh runs out of accreting material and eventually switches off .",
    "in addition to the cold gas accretion mode above , simulations also include a second agn feedback recipe , which is invoked to suppress the accretion of hot gas onto the central galaxy of large dark matter haloes ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 ; okamoto et al .",
    "2007 ; cattaneo et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this mode operates in systems where the supermassive bhs have already been built through mergers and are in place at the central galaxy regions . in this picture ,",
    "as galaxies enter the massive dark matter haloes of groups or clusters , their cold gas supply is cut off leading to passive evolution and their migration to the red cloud ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ; croton et al .",
    "however , cooling flows in these dense environments could produce a reservoir of cold gas in the central galaxy regions , the raw material for starburst and qso activity .",
    "low - level bh accretion is therefore invoked to counterbalance cooling flows by producing low - luminosity agn that heat the bulk of the cooling gas and thereby suppressing any subsequent star - formation in these galaxies .    in the two agn feedback prescriptions above ,",
    "the outflow scenario during the luminous and high accretion rate phase of bh growth , assigns agn a central role in establishing the bimodal colour distribution of galaxies by directly causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud .",
    "the distribution of x - ray selected agn in the cmd appears to be broadly consistent with this picture .",
    "agn are preferentially associated with galaxies in the red cloud , at the red limit of the blue cloud and in the transition zone in between .",
    "these associations are suggestive of agn - driven truncation of the star - formation ( nandra et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , more detailed study of the properties of agn reveal a number of inconsistencies with the merger scenario .",
    "obscured agn are predominantly hosted by galaxies in the red cloud ( nandra et al .",
    "2007 ; rovilos & georgantopoulos 2007 ) , with prominent bulges and little morphological evidence for ongoing major mergers ( grogin et al . 2003 ; pierce et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the red optical colours of these systems are most likely because of old stars and not dusty star - formation .",
    "although there are examples of deeply buried agn in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 ; franceschini et al . 2003 ; georgakakis et al . 2004",
    "; alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) , the frequency of these systems among the obscured x - ray population at @xmath4 is not yet clear .",
    "for example , rovilos et al . ( 2007 ) argue that a non - negligible fraction of x - ray selected agn at @xmath5 have @xmath6jy radio continuum emission ( 1.4ghz ) that is consistent with star - formation in the host galaxy .",
    "these authors however , do not find a strong trend between x - ray obscuration and the incidence of faint radio emission , likely to be associated with starbursts .",
    "a plausible interpretation of the evidence above is that current x - ray surveys are biased against the early phase of bh evolution . at this initial stage of their formation",
    ", agn may be deeply buried under star - forming clouds and/or low luminosity because the bh mass is still small , although growing rapidly .",
    "if there is such a population of obscured and/or intrinsically faint young agn below the detection threshold of current surveys , it may be possible to find them using stacking analysis .",
    "alternatively , agn may not be responsible for quenching the star - formation in galaxies and producing the bimodality of the cmd .",
    "a key test of this scenario is the incidence of agn in post - starburst galaxies , i.e. systems observed shortly after the termination of their star - formation ( @xmath0gyr ) . in the local universe ( @xmath7 ) , a number of studies point to an association between _ optically _ selected agn and post - starbursts ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 2004 ; goto 2006 ; yan et al .",
    "2006 ) . at @xmath8 ,",
    "close to the peak of the agn density in the universe ( e.g. barger et al . 2005 ; hasinger et al .",
    "2005 ) , there is still very limited information on the link between x - ray selected agn and post - starbursts .",
    "we address the issues above using data from the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ; davis et al .",
    "x - ray stacking is employed to search for deeply buried and/or low - luminosity agn among optically selected galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath1 to explore the role of bh accretion in establishing the bimodal colour distribution of these systems .",
    "we also study the x - ray properties of post - starbursts as identified from keck spectra at @xmath9 to investigate the link between recent star - formation events and active bhs .",
    "we adopt @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "details about the aegis datasets can be found in davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in this paper",
    "we use ( i ) the deep _ chandra _ observations to explore the x - ray properties of optical galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the deep2 survey , ( ii ) the _ spitzer _ irac and mips @xmath13 data to select subsamples based on mid - ir colour , and ( iii ) the high resolution _ hst_/acs imaging for morphological studies .",
    "the x - ray data are from the _ chandra _ survey of the extended groth strip ( egs ) .",

    "the data reduction , source detection and flux estimation are described in detail by nandra et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) and are based on methods presented by nandra et al .",
    "briefly , standard reduction steps are taken using the ciao version 3.2 data analysis software . after merging the individual observations into a single event file , we constructed images in four energy bands 0.5 - 7.0kev ( full ) , 0.5 - 2.0kev ( soft ) , 2.0 - 7.0kev ( hard ) and 4.0 - 7.0kev ( ultra - hard ) .",
    "the count rates in the above energy intervals are converted to fluxes in the standard bands 0.5 - 10 , 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 10 and 5 - 10kev , respectively . the limiting flux in each of these bands",

    "<S> the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud ( both direct detections and stacking results ) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of the star - formation . </S>",

    "<S> a large fraction of post - starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidence for at least moderate levels of agn obscuration . </S>",
