    "in the last few decades corrections to newton s law of gravitation and constraints on them have become the subject of considerable study ( see the monograph @xcite and reviews @xcite ) . from the experimental standpoint , it is of most importance that at separations between the test bodies below 0.1 mm newton s law is not confirmed by measurements with sufficient precision .",
    "theoretically , many extensions of the standard model of elementary particles and their interactions predict corrections to the newton law of power- and yukawa - type due to exchange of light and massless elementary particles @xcite . on the other hand , similar corrections",
    "are predicted by the extra - dimensional physics with a low - energy compactification scale @xcite .",
    "this makes the search for such corrections , or at least constraining their parameters , interesting for the problems of dark matter and unification of gravitation with other fundamental interactions .",
    "a lot of successful work has been done on constraining the power- and yukawa - type corrections to newton s law of gravitation from gravitational experiments of etvos- and cavendish - type @xcite .",
    "although the most strong constraints on the power - type corrections were obtained in this way , it was found that the resulting constraints on the yukawa - type corrections become much weaker in the interaction range below a few micrometers .",
    "this is explained by the fact that at sufficiently small separations between the test bodies the van der waals @xcite and casimir force @xcite becomes the dominant background force in place of gravitation .",
    "the two names belong to a single force of quantum origin caused by the zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "they are usually used at short and relatively large separations , respectively , where the effects of relativistic retardation are immaterial or , on the contrary , are influential and should be taken into account .    the possibility to constrain corrections to newton s law from the van der waals and casimir force",
    "was proposed long ago @xcite for the cases of yukawa - type and power - type corrections , respectively . at that time , however , reasonably precise measurements of the van der waals and casimir force were not available .",
    "things have changed during the last 15 years when a lot of more precise experiments on measuring the casimir force between metallic , dielectric and semiconductor bodies have been performed ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the measure of agreement between the measurement data of these experiments and theoretical description of the casimir force in the framework of the lifshitz theory resulted in the strengthening of previously known constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type corrections up to a factor of @xmath0 @xcite . using different experiments on measurement of the casimir force",
    ", the strongest constraints on the corrections to newton s law were obtained over a wide interaction region from about 1 nm to a few micrometers .",
    "note that for shorter interaction regions the strongest constraints on the yukawa - type corrections follow from precise atomic physics @xcite , whereas starting from a few micrometers the gravitational experiments @xcite remain the most reliable source of such constraints .    in this paper",
    "we obtain constraints on the yukawa - type corrections to newton s gravitational law from two recently performed experiments on measuring the casimir interaction by means of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "each of these experiments is highly significant , as compared with all earlier measurements of the casimir interaction . in the first @xcite the dynamic afm",
    "was used to measure the gradient of the casimir force between a plate and a sphere both coated with the ferromagnetic metal ni with no spontaneous magnetization . as a result , the predictions of the lifshitz theory generalized for the case of magnetic materials more than 40 years ago @xcite were experimentally confirmed .",
    "the distinguished feature of the experiment with two magnetic surfaces is also that it allows to shed light on the role of some important systematic effects ( see sec .",
    "ii for details ) and , thus , remove any doubt in the reliability of constraints obtained .    in the second experiment of our interest here @xcite the static afm was used to measure the casimir force between a plate and a sphere both with sinusoidally corrugated surfaces coated with nonmagnetic metal au . the unusual feature of this experiment , as compared with earlier performed experiments with corrugated surfaces , is that the casimir force was measured at various angles between the longitudinal corrugations on both bodies .",
    "this introduced into the problem an additional parameter ( the angle between corrugations ) that can be chosen to obtain the most strong constraints from the measure of agreement between the experimental data and theory of the casimir force for corrugated surfaces based on the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "the constraints on corrections to newton s law obtained by us from the experiment with magnetic surfaces are in agreement with those obtained earlier @xcite for smooth au surfaces by means of dynamic afm @xcite , but slightly weaker due to different densities of au and ni . the advantage of constraints following from the experiment with ni surfaces is that they are not only fully justified on their own , but add substantiation to the constraints obtained from the experiments with nonmagnetic metal surfaces . as to constraints obtained from the experiment with corrugated surfaces ,",
    "they are stronger up to a factor of 4 than the most strong constraints reported so far @xcite in the interaction region from 11.6 to 29.2 nm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  ii we present the exact expression for the yukawa - type interaction in the experimental configuration of ref .",
    "@xcite and derive the respective constraints on corrections to newton s gravitational law .",
    "the advantages of using magnetic materials are elucidated .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the experiment with corrugated surfaces @xcite . here , we derive an expression for the yukawa - type force in configurations with different angles between corrugations .",
    "the obtained expression is used to find the stronger constraints on corrections to newton s law .",
    "some modifications in the setup are proposed allowing further strengthening of the constraints in configurations with corrugated surfaces . in sec .",
    "iv the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "we begin with the standard parametrization of the spin - independent yukawa - type correction to newton s gravitational law @xcite ( for spin - dependent corrections see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the total gravitational potential between the two point - like masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 spaced at a separation @xmath3 takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the newtonian part and the yukawa - type correction , respectively . here , @xmath7 is the newtonian gravitational constant , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the strength and interaction range of the yukawa - type correction .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite it can be shown that at separations below a few micrometers the newtonian gravitational force between the test bodies @xmath10 and @xmath11 in experiments under consideration is much smaller than the error in measurements of the casimir force .",
    "because of this , in all subsequent calculations the newtonian potential can be neglected , and the yukawa - type addition to it is considered on the background of the measured casimir force",
    ". then the gravitational force acting between the test bodies at short separations can be obtained by the integration of the yukawa - type correction @xmath6 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) over the volumes of both bodies @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the closest separation between the test bodies and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the respective mass densities ( note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not constant because in the experiments used below each test body consists of several homogeneous layers of different densities ) .",
    "the gravitational force due to the yukawa - type correction and its gradient are given by @xmath18    in the experiment @xcite the gradient of the casimir force was measured between a ni - coated plate and a ni - coated hollow microsphere attached to the tip of an afm cantilever operated in the dynamic regime @xcite .",
    "the silicon plate ( @xmath10 ) of a few millimeter diameter and thickness can be considered as having an infinitely large area and an infinitely large thickness when we have to deal with the submicrometer region of @xmath9 .",
    "the density of si is @xmath19 . for technological purposes",
    "the si plate was coated first with a layer of cr having a thickness @xmath20 nm and density @xmath21 and then with a layer of al having a thickness @xmath22 nm and density @xmath23 .",
    "finally the plate was coated with an outer layer of magnetic metal ni with a thickness @xmath24 nm and density @xmath25 .",
    "the hollow microsphere ( @xmath11 ) was made of glass with density @xmath26 .",
    "the thickness of the spherical envelope was @xmath27 m .",
    "the sphere was also coated with successive layers of cr , al and ni having the thicknesses @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 nm . the outer radius of the sphere with all the coatings included is @xmath31 m .",
    "the exact integration over the volumes of a plate and a sphere in eq.([eq2 ] ) with account of their layer structure can be performed like in ref .",
    "@xcite . then , substituting the obtained result in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath32 where the following notations are introduced : @xmath33 and the following notation is introduced @xmath34    the constraints on the parameters ( @xmath35 ) , which are often referred to as the parameters of _ non - newtonian gravity _ , can be obtained from the comparison between the measurement data for the gradient of the casimir force @xmath36 and respective theory . in ref .  @xcite it was found that within the entire separation region from 223 to 550 nm there is an excellent agreement between the data and theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory of the van der waals and casimir force @xcite with omitted relaxation properties of conduction electrons ( the so - called _ plasma model approach _ ) .",
    "the predictions of the lifshitz theory with included relaxation properties of free charge carriers ( the so - called _ drude model approach _ ) were excluded by the measurement data at a 95% confidence level within the separation region from 223 to 350 nm ( in the end of this section we provide a brief discussion of different approaches to the lifshitz theory which is essential for obtaining constraints on non - newtonian gravity ) .",
    "the measure of agreement with the adequate theory is characterized by the total experimental error @xmath37 in the measured gradient of the casimir force determined at a 67% confidence level @xcite . keeping in mind that within the limits of this error no additional interaction of yukawa - type was observed , the constraints on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 can be obtained from the inequality @xmath38    we have substituted eqs .",

    "the dotted line shows the constraints obtained @xcite from the experiment on measuring gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a ni - coated plate @xcite using the same setup . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , the constraints indicated by the solid line are slightly weaker than those shown by the dashed and dotted lines .",
    "this is caused by the fact that density of ni is smaller than density of au and by different experimental errors .",
    "note also that our constraints shown by the solid line can be obtained in a simpler way by using the proximity force approximation @xcite @xmath50 to calculate the gradient of the yukawa - type force , where @xmath51 is the energy per unit area of yukawa - type interaction between two plane - parallel plates having the same layer structure as our test bodies . according to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , this is possible under the conditions @xmath52 which are satisfied in our experimental configuration with a wide safety margin . in this case",
    "the function @xmath53 with any argument @xmath3 can be approximately replaced with @xmath54 .",
    "it would be interesting also to compare the constraints on non - newtonian gravity obtained here from the experiment with two ni surfaces ( solid line in fig .",

    ", the lifshitz theory is in agreement with the plasma model approach to the casimir force , which disregards the relaxation properties of free charge carriers , and excludes the drude model approach taking these properties into account ( see the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite and earlier experiments reviewed in refs .",
    "this is against expectations of many and gave rise to the search of some systematic effects which could reverse the situation .",
    "after several unsuccessful attempts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) the influence of large surface patches was selected as the most probable systematic effect which could bring the data in agreement with the drude model approach @xcite . in two experiments on measuring the casimir force between au surfaces",
    "@xcite hypothetical large patches were described by models with free fitting parameters and used in respective fitting procedures .",
    "in these experiments , which are not independent measurements of the casimir force , an agreement of the data with the drude model approach has been claimed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a critical discussion ) .",
    "the crucial point to underline here is that for nonmagnetic metals the drude model approach leads to smaller gradients of the casimir force than the plasma model approach @xcite .",
    "thus , the effect of large patch potentials ( which leads to an attraction similar to the casimir force ) is added to the predictions of the drude model approach and might make the total theoretical force compatible with the measurement data @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for two magnetic metals the drude model approach leads to larger gradients of the casimir force than the plasma model approach @xcite .",
    "thus , if the effect of patches were important in this case , it would further increase the disagreement between the predictions of the drude model approach and the measurement data observed in ref .",
    "this confirms that surface patches do not play an important role in precise experiments on measuring the casimir force in accordance with the model of patches @xcite predicting a negligibly small effect from patches @xcite .",
    "recently the patches on au samples used in measurements of the casimir force were investigated by means of kelvin probe microscopy @xcite .",
    "the force originating from them was found to be too small to affect the conclusions following from precise measurements of the casimir force .",
    "it is the matter of fact that the experimental data of all independent measurements of the casimir interaction between both nonmagnetic and magnetic metals are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the lifshitz theory combined with the plasma model approach and exclude the drude model approach .",
    "although the fundamental reasons behind this fact have not yet been finally understood , the constraints on non - newtonian gravity obtained on this basis can be already considered as reliable enough .",
    "in sec .  ii we have used the most recent measurement of the casimir interaction where the material dependence played a major role in theory - experiment comparison .",
    "another recent experiment @xcite is of quite a different nature . in ref .",
    "@xcite the normal casimir force acting perpendicular to the surface was measured between the sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate .",
    "the corrugated boundary surfaces have long been used in measurements of the casimir force ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example , the normal casimir force between a rectangular corrugated semiconductor ( si ) plate and a smooth au sphere has been measured by means of a micromachined oscillator and compared with theory based on the exact scattering approach @xcite . the obtained constraints on non - newtonian gravity are discussed in sec .",

    "a further example is the lateral casimir force between a sinusoidally corrugated plate and a sinusoidally corrugated sphere , both coated with au , which was measured and compared with exact theory in refs .",
    "this experiment resulted in the maximum strengthening of constraints on non - newtonian gravity from the casimir effect by a factor of @xmath57 discussed in sec .",

    "<S> it is shown that constraints following from the experiment with magnetic surfaces are slightly weaker than currently available strongest constraints , but benefit from increased reliability and independence of systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints derived from the experiment with corrugated surfaces within the interaction region from 11.6 to 29.2 nm are stronger up to a factor of 4 than the strongest constraints derived from other experiments . the possibility of further strengthening of constraints on non - newtonian gravity by using the configurations with corrugated boundaries is proposed . </S>"
