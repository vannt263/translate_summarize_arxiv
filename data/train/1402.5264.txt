    "<S> in this paper , we introduce a new four - parameter generalization of the exponentiated weibull ( ew ) distribution , called the exponentiated weibull - logarithmic ( ewl ) distribution , which obtained by compounding ew and logarithmic distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the new distribution arises on a latent complementary risks scenario , in which the lifetime associated with a particular risk is not observable ; rather , we observe only the maximum lifetime value among all risks . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution exhibits decreasing , increasing , unimodal and bathtub - shaped hazard rate functions , depending on its parameters and contains several lifetime sub - models such as : generalized exponential - logarithmic ( gel ) , complementary weibull - logarithmic ( cwl ) , complementary exponential - logarithmic ( cel ) , exponentiated rayleigh - logarithmic ( erl ) and rayleigh - logarithmic ( rl ) distributions . </S>",
