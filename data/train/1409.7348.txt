    "light can exert a force . although this statement is uncontroversial today , its confirmation was a remarkable triumph a little over a century ago@xcite , only a couple of centuries after scientists had finally managed to show that light moves at all ( as opposed to appearing instantaneously ) .",
    "much of the early treatment of this force was limited to light incident on planar surfaces described by some absorption and reflection coefficients , in which the resulting `` radiation pressure '' can be explained by intuitive arguments that continue to dominate pedagogical materials .",
    "perversely , this classical force is easiest to understand through a quantum picture  @xcite : since a photon with energy @xmath0 has relativistic momentum @xmath1 , a black surface that completely absorbs normal - incident light with power @xmath2 should experience a force @xmath3 , corresponding to the rate at which it receives momentum .",
    "similar arguments apparently imply , from conservation of momentum , that light can only `` push '' on a flat surface ( with a force of at most @xmath4 ) and can never `` pull . ''",
    "however , in microstructured systems , the forces induced by electromagnetic waves are complicated by a number of additional possibilities .",
    "one can consider forces induced by guided waves , resonant modes , and evanescent waves in addition to forces exerted by incident waves from vacuum , which can both change the nature of the force and ( thanks to spatiotemporal localization ) greatly enhance its strength . in systems with multiple components ,",
    "one component can either pull or push a neighboring component , since momentum - conservation restrictions only apply to the net force on all components rather than to the force on any individual object .",
    "even for an isolated object , focused beams on a small object can scatter oblique light forward , a transfer of momentum from the object to the wave that creates an optical `` tractor beam ''  @xcite .",
    "we review many of these possibilities and their applications in section  [ sec : classical ] .",
    "in addition to these geometric and localization effects , section  [ sec : fluct ] reviews another consideration that arises for optical forces at submicron scales : classical optical forces arise from external sources of electromagnetic fields , but there are also _ internal _ sources , namely thermal and quantum charge oscillations .",
    "most famously , the vibrations of matter give rise to thermal radiation , the familiar glow of hot objects  @xcite , but the same fields carry momentum as well as energy .",
    "intuitively , two hot objects will push each other apart with their thermal radiation , but this picture is incomplete because it does not include ambient radiation , and the effect is dramatically altered for objects in thermal equilibrium with their environment . for well - separated objects in thermal equilibrium , the omnidirectional radiation from both the objects and their environment exactly cancels and there is no net force on any object , but for surfaces at submicron separations the evanescent coupling and other effects tend to produce an _ attractive _ force .",
    "in the limit of zero temperature , this attractive force remains due to quantum fluctuations and is known as a `` casimir '' force  @xcite . for a single pair of atoms ,",
    "the same phenomenon is a van der waals force known as the `` london - dispersion '' force ( or the `` casimir  polder '' force once wave effects are included )  @xcite .",
    "( although such forces have a sometimes bewildering variety of theoretical descriptions , ranging from zero - point energy sums to path - integral models , it turns out that all of these expressions are mathematically equivalent to the forces of fields produced by vibrating charges in matter  @xcite . )",
    "casimir forces between parallel metallic surfaces , first predicted in 1948 and reviewed in section  [ sec : cas - exps ] , were finally observed quantitatively in 1978  @xcite and have subsequently been measured in a wide variety of microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) with increasing precision  @xcite .",
    "however , until the last decade , both theoretical predictions and experiments were limited to planar or near - planar geometries with the exception of a handful of theoretical special cases .",
    "this has now changed , thanks to both powerful new computational tools and rapidly expanding capabilities of micromechanical experiments , enabling an explosion in _ designer _ casimir forces ( reviewed in section  [ sec : cas - designs ] ) with exotic properties extending far beyond simple attraction between parallel surfaces . because casimir forces remain when all other electromagnetic interactions ( external fields , static charges , and so on ) are removed",
    ", section  [ sec : cas - tech ] explains that they represent both an ultimate limitation and , potentially , an opportunity for mems devices as they approach the nanoscale .",
    "researchers have long pursued the use of electromagnetic waves to induce mechanical motion .",
    "kepler was the first to hypothesize that solar radiation is responsible for the deflection of comet tails away from the sun . by 1903 ,",
    "lebedew  @xcite and nichols and hull @xcite had proved maxwell s hypothesis that light impinging on a thin metallic disk in vacuum would induce measurable motion . over the course of the next century",
    ", applications for harnessing the energy of light were seen in systems ranging from  solar sails \" and accelerators  @xcite to optical traps and tweezers  @xcite . in the last decade , interest in near - field optical interactions has steadily increased , as on - chip optical circuitry has presented viable alternatives to slower electronic systems . the initial single - beam trapping experiment by ashkin et .",
    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate the usefulness of optical gradient forces for the manipulation of macroscopic objects : a tightly focused laser beam can trap a spherical dielectric particle in both normal and tangential directions by balancing the scattering and gradients forces acting on the particle .",
    "subsequent experiments demonstrated laser cooling and trapping of ions and neutral atoms  @xcite , leading to breakthroughs in various aspects of atomic physics , including the realization of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , quantum simulation of arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices , and a new field of atom optics  @xcite .",
    "the physics of optomechanics has a strong resemblance with doppler cooling in atomic / optical physics  @xcite , whose groundbreaking development preceded optomechanics by two decades , except that in optomechanical systems the predicted quantum nature is manifested in macroscopic objects . instead of the atomic energy levels being dressed due to strong light ",
    "atom interactions , in optomechanics , the photonic resonant states are dressed due to strong optomechanical interactions .",
    "in addition to dynamical effects , optomechanical forces also lead to nano- and micro - meter mechanical displacements with milliwatts or smaller incident powers .",
    "similar to conventional optical trapping , optical forces in optomechanical systems can be categorized into radiation , gradient , or photothermal forces . in the following sections",
    ", we briefly review the basic physics of gradient optical forces in micronscale systems and survey recent developments paving the way toward designable interactions in a wide range of optomechanical systems , where the amplitude , wavelength , and phase of incident light can be used to obtain tunable attractive and repulsive forces .",
    "radiation pressure involves transfer of momentum via propagating waves to a compliant object .",
    "while a photon carrying momentum @xmath5 , or alternatively incident light carrying power @xmath2 , is bounded by momentum conservation to contribute net pressure @xmath6 ( assuming 100% of the light is reflected from the object ) , the small momentum imparted by the photon can be drastically enhanced by introducing an optical cavity .",
    "assuming negligible lossses , the force on any individual part of a cavity can be many times larger than the net force on the cavity as the photon continues to exchange momentum with it over the cavity lifetime @xmath7 , thereby enhancing the force by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the canonical example of such radiation - pressure enhancements in optomechanical systems is a simple fabry - perot cavity formed by two highly reflective mirrors in which one of the mirrors is allowed to move , leading to a number of observable mechanical effects  @xcite .",

    "designs tailored for applications in optomechanical systems often involve structures with co - localized optical and mechanical modes [ fig .",
    "[ fig : collage](k ) ] , where the combination of large optical quality factors @xmath8 ( dimensionless lifetimes in the range of tens of thousands or above ) and long - lived mechanical modes ( with frequencies in the mhz - ghz ) have enabled exciting and novel demonstrations of optical spring effects , optomechanically induced self - oscillations , on - chip storage and manipulation of light pulses  @xcite and noise  @xcite , on - chip accelerometers  @xcite , microfluidic sensors  @xcite , and cooling of macroscopic objects  @xcite .",
    "gradient forces involve interactions induced by incident evanescent or gradient electromagnetic fields . in optomechanical systems ,",
    "the most explored of these interactions is the force induced on a microcavity by the evanescent field of a nearby waveguide or substrate , where similar to radiation pressure , the forces are also greatly enhanced by resonances  @xcite .",
    "these include microcavities coupled to waveguides  @xcite , free - standing slot waveguides leading to wideband tuning and low - power optical modulation  @xcite , phc nanobeam waveguides coupled to substrates leading to unusual , non - monotonic attractive forces  @xcite , zipper - like structures leading to optically controlled mechanical transparency  @xcite , hybrid plasmonic waveguides leading to deep subwavelength confinement of light  @xcite , and plasmonic nanobeams  @xcite or bowtie antennas  @xcite , some of which are illustrated in fig .",

    "the interaction between coupled resonances through their evanescent field can lead to even richer phenomena , such as tunable attractive ( bonding ) and repulsive ( anti - bonding ) gradient forces between nearby optomechanical objects .",
    "the ability to generate repulsive forces and to tune the sign and magnitude of these interactions by adjusting either the wavelength or phase of incident light is also poised to make an impact in future photonic switching  @xcite and mems devices , where they could be exploited in conjunction with other forces such as casimir or electrostatic forces ( as described in section  [ sec : cas - tech ] ) .",
    "finally , light can lead to mechanical deformations through photothermal interactions , whereby a movable structure absorbs part of the incident light that is converted to heat .",
    "for instance , thermal stresses can arise in suspended devices as a result of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the device layer and underlying supporting substrate@xcite , leading to bending of the movable structure .",
    "such photothermal deformations can often be enhanced by the introduction of a microcavity .",
    "examples illustrated in fig .  [ fig : collage](l ) include a gold - coated silicon cantilever excited by a gold - coated optical fiber placed in close proximity , forming a fabry ",
    "perot cavity  @xcite , and a cavity formed by a cantilever and neighboring substrate , excited with a laser frequency above the silicon bandgap  @xcite .",
    "while the photothermal effect also allows for optical spring tuning and dynamic back - action ( mediated by delay due to its finite thermal time constant ) , the photothermal effect often presents itself as a competing effect in the demonstration of several optomechanical devices  @xcite .      among the successes of optomechanics",
    "is unprecedented access to quantum regimes of macroscopic objects , most commonly realized in singly resonant optomechanical structures  @xcite .",

    "the force amplitude of the bonding mode increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath11 , whereas the anti - bonding force is only repulsive at separations @xmath14 , becoming attractive at short distances . ]    to illustrate the origin of optical gradient forces between resonant optomechanical systems we begin by considering one of the first proposed optomechanical structures exhibiting this effect , involving two square dielectric waveguides placed in close proximity  @xcite .",
    "in such a system , the mutual interaction of degenerate resonances or guided modes via their evanescent fields can induce a splitting of the modes into pairs characterized by attractive and repulsive mechanical forces , analogous to the well - known bonding and anti - bonding states formed by the level splitting ( avoided crossings ) of interacting degenerate states in quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the degree of mode splitting from the initial mode frequencies is controlled by the coupling strength ( or proximity ) between the waveguides  @xcite .",
    "the idea is illustrated in the dispersion diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : wg_force](a ) , which shows changes in the frequency dispersion of the two waveguide modes as they approach one another from infinity  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between changes in the frequency and mechanical energy of the system can in turn be understood from a simple heuristic quantum - mechanical argument  @xcite .",
    "in particular , assuming that @xmath15 photons of frequency @xmath16 and conserved wavevector are coupled into the waveguide system , the photonic energy @xmath0 can be written as , @xmath17 from which it follows that a small change in the separation will shift @xmath16 and result in an optomechanical force , @xmath18 acting on both waveguides .",
    "as expected , the final expression for the force does not depend on @xmath19 but rather on the total stored energy in the system and can be derived and verified via classical arguments  @xcite",
    ". a useful figure of merit present in eq .",
    "[ fopt ] is the so - called optomechanical coupling @xmath20 , which fascilitates direct comparison of optomechanical forces between different structures .",
    "mixing between the modes of the isolated waveguides as they come together causes a splitting in the frequency , where as expected from a simple tight - binding picture or from perturbation theory  @xcite , they hybridize into symmetric ( lower frequency ) and anti - symmetric ( higher frequency ) modes . typically , when the guided waves are in phase ( a bonding / symmetric mode ) , the electromagnetic energy can be reduced by increasing the field intensity in high - dielectric regions , leading to an attractive optical force that pushes the waveguides closer to one another .",
    "conversely , when the guided waves are out of phase ( an anti - bonding / anti - symmetric mode ) , the energy can be reduced by increasing the field intensity in low - dielectric regions , leading to a repulsive force . when mechanical degrees of freedom are introduced in these coupled structures , i.e.",
    "the waveguides are partially released from the bottom substrate , these optical forces push the waveguides in an effort to reconfigure the waveguides and hence lower the total energy . in this particular example , the polarity of the optical force is predominantly determined by the relative phases of the electric field in the respective waveguides , which yields a control parameter to obtain tunable optomechanical effects , even switching the sign of the force from attractive to repulsive , an effect that was first observed experimentally in refs .",
    "although the simple tight - binding picture above is sufficient to explain the main features of gradient forces at large separations @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a characteristic lengthscale corresponding to the exponential tail of the modes , at shorter separations @xmath23 it can fail dramatically and one must therefore rely on exact calculations .",
    "these features are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wg_force](b ) , which shows the forces induced by both the bonding and antibonding modes of the waveguides over a wide range of separations . as observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : wg_force](b ) , the force scales exponentially with @xmath24 at large separations and exhibits a more complicated @xmath24-dependence at smaller separations . in this geometry ,",
    "non - perturbative effects arising at short separations lead to a dramatic qualitative change in the behavior of the anti - symmetric mode , manifested as an increasingly weaker force with decreasing @xmath24 which ultimately switches sign ( becoming attractive ) below some threshold @xmath25 .",
    "generalizations of this phenomenon to other coupled - cavity systems ( e.g. microsphere , microdisk , and photonic crystal cavities ) have paved the way for designable gradient forces . while most optomechanical structures often involve some kind of resonant effect , technically eq .",
    "[ fopt ] is only applicable in closed systems comprising lossless ( guided ) resonances . in the presence of small losses , e.g. stemming from either radiation or absorption ,",
    "similar formulas can be derived ( independent of the quantum - mechanical picture above ) which relate forces to the frequencies , incident power , and lifetimes of the corresponding leaky modes  @xcite . in more general circumstances where there may not be well - defined resonant modes with negligible loss , or situations where there are superpositions of resonant modes with other waves ( e.g. light from an external source ) , modal approaches",
    "become problematic .",
    "however , because optical forces are directly related to the solution of scattering problems , i.e. electromagnetic fields due to incident currents or fields , one can also frame the calculation of forces using formulations that do not rely on either mode or energy calculations and which generalize to other situations of interest , e.g. non - resonant or broad - bandwidth excitation , and even optical torques  @xcite .",
    "one such approach involves computing the force via the integral @xmath26 of the time - averaged maxwell stress - tensor , @xmath27 \\label{eq : tij}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] around some surface @xmath28 lying in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "calculation of stress tensors between vacuum - separated bodies sidestep issues relating to evaluation of energy densities in lossy media  , and have been performed in a variety of contexts .",
    "for instance , @xmath29 can be directly computed via eigenmode calculations in systems with negligible loss  @xcite , or more generally by solving a set of linear equations for the fields in the frequency domain via finite differences , boundary or finite elements , and transfer - matrix methods  @xcite .",
    "if a broad - band force spectrum is desired , one can also compute stress tensors via the fourier transform of a short pulse in the time domain , yielding the entire spectrum at once  @xcite .",
    "modern numerical methods based on the surface - integral equation formulation of electromagnetic scattering sidestep altogether the need to integrate stress tensors over bounding surfaces ( which can lead to numerical problems ) or computations of scattered fields , and instead express the force ( or torque ) via compact trace formulas that involve the solution of well - studied linear systems from the boundary - element method  @xcite . ultimately ,",
    "since incident light is often introduced over a narrow range of frequencies , calculations can be performed expediently and for arbitrarily complicated structures . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : cas - theory ] , similar numerical techniques have been developed for computations of fluctuation forces , where the significantly larger number of radiating centers and bandwidths complicate matters .      since the first demonstrations of attractive and repulsive optical gradient forces between either a silicon waveguide and a silica substrate  @xcite or two silicon waveguides  @xcite , a deluge of optomechanical structures actuated by resonantly enhanced optical gradient forces rapidly emerged .",

    "each coupled system has its own competitive edge depending on the desired application , e.g. choice of mechanical modes suitable for atmospheric operations , choice of materials for thermal power handling , considerations based on the coupling mechanism or bandwidth requirements , etcetera , but most designs share the general feature of frequency - dependent polarity of gradient forces .",
    "similar to level repulsion in guided modes of coupled waveguides , resonances with finite lifetime , be they whispering gallery modes , guided resonances in one and two - dimensional photonic crystals , or localized modes in phc cavities , split into attractive and repulsive force pairs upon evanescent coupling , enabling actuation of devices by choosing the corresponding excitation frequencies .",

    "in particular , rather than summing the energy contribution of dipoles within the macroscopic bodies , casimir showed that it is equivalent to instead consider the energy stored in the corresponding ( induced ) electromagnetic fields . within this formulation",
    ", the quantum - mechanical zero - point energy of the electromagnetic field can be related to the sum over modes of the system , @xmath79 where @xmath19 is the reduced planck s constant and @xmath80 is the energy of a virtual photon with frequency @xmath16 .",

    "[ eq : ucas ] and eq .",

    "first , we should note that the use of photon number in the classical energy expression of eq .",
    "[ uopt ] is merely a heuristic and convenient way of relating the energy stored in a given mode to its corresponding frequency , and of course bears no relation to the physical energy stored in the system , which arises from externally incident light .",

    "hence the quantity @xmath19 appears in the final expression for the pressure ( eq .",
    "[ eq : pc ] ) .",
    "second , since the casimir energy is a result of broad - bandwidth electromagnetic fluctuations , from electrostatic all the way to uv wavelengths where materials become transparent , eq .  [ eq : ucas ] contains a sum over all frequencies . as a consequence , whereas designs based on classical forces often focus on resonant effects , looking at the energy or force contributions within a narrow frequency bandwidth can be very deceptive in the casimir case .    to illustrate this point , fig .",
    "[ fig : casimag ] shows the casimir force integrand as a function of @xmath16 for two semi - infinite gold plates . note that the expression in eq .",

    "such cutoffs are motivated by the fact that these divergences are not physical , since real materials such as the gold plates of fig .",
    "[ fig : casimag ] become transparent at large @xmath16 . ]",
    "regardless of material considerations one finds that generally , while certain frequencies give attractive contributions , others give repulsion , and the overall sign is determined by a complicated cancellation between these effects .",
    "the sum - over - modes calculation for dielectric plates dates back to the original work by van kampen  @xcite , who computed the force in the near field @xmath86 , where @xmath22 is a characteristic wavelength which for metals corresponds to the plasma wavelength ( typically in the ultraviolet range ) . in this quasistatic regime ,",
    "the force law scales as @xmath87 whereas at large separations @xmath21 , the force again scales as @xmath88 . in between ,",
    "the @xmath24-dependence of the force is determined by the frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath89 of the materials involved .",
    "this transition reveals the increasing contribution of evanescent waves in the near field , as recognized by van kampen .",
    "more recently , there has been renewed interest in analyzing the modal contributions at different frequencies and separations , which just as in the classical case , can be classified as arising from either evanescent ( gradient ) or propagating ( radiative ) modes  @xcite .",
    "such a decomposition was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , which found that evanescent modes not only dominate the interaction at small @xmath24 , but also contribute a significant repulsive component at larger separations stemming from the contribution of antibonding modes , with bonding modes contributing attraction in analogy with classical forces .",
    "ultimately , however , the sign and scaling of the force is determined by a competition between the radiative , bonding , and antibonding evanescent modes , which lead to attraction at all separations .",
    "such an interplay is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : casimag ] for the example of two gold plates .",
    "it is worth noting that , because incident light in classical systems is typically introduced over a narrow bandwidth , the scaling of gradient forces with separation is often exponential at large separations @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the decay length of the corresponding excited mode .",
    "in contrast , casimir forces arise from contributions spanning many such modes , each contributing different exponential decays , the cumulative effect of which leads to the usual polynomial scaling . hence ,",
    "even if the force contributions seem to be dramatically altered within a narrow bandwidth , as is often the case in classical systems , this alteration is usually canceled by contributions at other frequencies and therefore has little influence on the force .",
    "in addition to posing conceptual challenges , the broad and oscillatory character of the casimir spectrum also imposes severe limitations for theoretical and numerical calculations , as reviewed in refs .",
    "the key to overcoming these problems is a well - known technique from complex analysis involving extensions of the real - frequency integrand into the complex plane , on which practically all modern calculations are based . specifically , because the casimir force integrand is unobservable and related to causal scattering problems ( fields due to dipole antennas ) , it is an analytic function in the upper - half complex frequency plane ( @xmath92 ) , and hence the integral along real frequency is mathematically equivalent to the integral along the imaginary - frequency axis @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the presence of oscillations and resonances in the casimir integrand is linked to the fact that dipole sources oscillating at real frequencies @xmath16 produce radially propagating spherical waves @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the distance away from the dipole , which in turn lead to the sensitive interference and cancellation effects employed in classical designs .",
    "along imaginary frequencies @xmath96 , however , dipole sources lead to exponentially decaying fields @xmath97 , which in turn yields integrands that are smooth , non - oscillatory and exponentially decaying ( decay lenghts @xmath98 ) and which are highly susceptible to efficient numerical integration , e.g. numerical quadrature .",
    "the absence of resonances along imaginary frequencies extends to material responses as well , since the permittivity of passive materials @xmath99 evaluated at imaginary frequencies decays monotonically with @xmath100  @xcite . to illustrate this exponential behavior , fig .",
    "[ fig : casimag](b ) shows the casimir integrand between gold plates along the imaginary frequency contour .",
    "while this imaginary - frequency perspective is crucial for numerics , it also suggests that when thinking of modifications to casimir forces ( in contrast to classical design principles that focus mainly on resonant phenomena ) it is particularly useful to employ intuition from quasistatics ( @xmath101 ) , where the lack of resonances and interference effects captures the decaying , non - oscillatory physics at imaginary frequencies   tends to make the total force qualitatively similar to the @xmath102 contribution , which dominate in the near - field or van der waals regime . ] .      unlike classical forces , the study of casimir forces was until recently hampered by a lack of theoretical tools .",
    "accurate experimental measurements were also until recently extremely challenging due to the small magnitude of these interactions at large separations @xmath103 m .",
    "the emergence of new theoretical tools and state - of - the - art experimental setups is finally enabling synergistic explorations of this phenomenon , and one emerging topic of interest is the design of structures exhibiting force behaviors that differ from the standard attractive @xmath88 powerlaw of planar pec bodies , and which aid in reducing or altogether switching the sign of the force . as discussed below , a few of these new theoretical predictions have been realized in experiments , though the range of potential effects remains largely unstudied .",
    "the sum - over - modes approach described above provides a conceptually useful starting point for understanding casimir forces and has been subject to multiple modifications to include realistic structures including lossy materials and finite objects  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that in practice it is seldom employed for calculations , which more commonly rely on modern perspectives and theoretical techniques that lie much closer to the original picture of fluctuating dipoles introduced by van der waals and others  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this intuitive picture provides a direct and intuitive connection to classical scattering problems by way of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of statistical physics  @xcite , relating the dissipative properties of bodies to the resulting dipole fluctuations .",
    "although such a relationship was first derived in the context of microscopic dipole ",
    "current fluctuations within the volumes of the bodies , more recent approaches reduce the problem to a smaller number of scattering problems involving sources and/or incident electromagnetic waves only on surfaces around bodies  @xcite . in fact , the first generalization of casimir s original derivation was carried out by lifshitz , dzyaloshinski , and pitaevski in the 1960s  @xcite where , rather than summing mode contributions , they considered instead calculations based on thermodynamic maxwell stress tensors ( ensemble average of eq .",

    "modification arising from boundary effects were also studied , albeit using ad - hoc approximations valid only in the limit of small curvatures .",
    "these include pairwise additive approximations such as the well - known derjaguin or proximity - force approximation ( pfa )  @xcite , which to lowest order yield the force between nearly planar bodies by summing the force per unit area of an equivalent parallel - plate geometry over all adjacent surfaces , providing an intuitive way of conceptualizing changes to the force .",

    "it took almost four decades for sophisticated numerical techniques that can capture the full spectrum of non - additive effects in realistic , microstructures geometries to be developed  @xcite .",

    "the thread connecting all of these formulation is the underlying relationship between electromagnetic fluctuations and classical scattering problems .",
    "because many such scattering problems must be solved to compute even a single force , calculations tend to be significantly more computationally demanding than classical force simulations .",

    "although a significant step in the right direction , the experiment was performed at lengthscales and separations that precluded significant multi - body effects from being observed .    aside from non - monotonicity , one might ask whether it is possible to significantly reduce or even flip the sign of the force from attractive to repulsive .",
    "design principles for achieving repulsion have eluded theorists and experimentalists for decades , and currently there are only a handful of ways of doing so .",

    "reveal that the long - range casimir force between a gold - coated sphere and a silicon plate immersed in bromobenzene is repulsive ; in contrast , the force becomes attractive when the plate is replaced by a thick gold film . because such repulsions depend on the dielectric properties of materials over a wide range of wavelengths , not all fluid  material combinations lead to repulsion .",
    "current experimental efforts are shedding light on these issues by developing tighter bounds on material properties of common fluids and by exploring broader sets of material configurations  @xcite .",

    "examples include effective magnetodielectric , chiral and paramagnetic metamaterials that were initially predicted to strongly alter casimir interactions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , while metamaterials have proven useful in classical - force designs ( as described above ) , they often rely on narrow - band resonances that turn out to have a negligible effect on the force once the full spectrum and realistic microstructures are considered  @xcite . in fact , general arguments based on the passivity of dielectric ( non - magnetic ) materials discount the possibility of repulsion in general multilayer systems  @xcite .",

    "finally , reductions in the force can also be achieved by modifying material properties at the atomic and electronic level , such as by varying the doping  @xcite or carrier density  @xcite of semiconductors like silicon , or by employing aereogels with varying porosity  @xcite .",
    "structural approaches have only recently begun to be explored , thanks largely to the emergence of powerful theoretical techniques .",
    "these sophisticated formulations have also been used to establish general limits on the kinds of repulsive interactions that can arise through structural considerations alone .",

    "there remain however many other circumstances of interest . in planar systems",
    "the only structural degrees of freedom are the thicknesses of films , which can be varied to obtain non - negligible reductions in the force  @xcite .",
    "for instance , decreasing the thickness of a metal film beyond its corresponding bulk skin - depth in the infrared to ultraviolet regime , i.e. @xmath128 nm for common metals , causes the film to become increasingly transparent ( non - reflective ) and this results in a corresponding decrease in the casimir force .",

    "for instance , two interleaved objects such as the zipper - like glide - symmetric structure shown in fig .  [ fig : cas - collage](f ) involving interleaved metal brackets attached to parallel plates , can repel one another due to a competition between lateral and normal forces .",
    "in particular , depending on the separation , the attractive lateral force between the brackets can dominate the interaction and either contribute toward or act against the attractive plate  plate and plate  bracket interactions , the net result of which is attraction at large and short separations and repulsion at intermediate separations .",
