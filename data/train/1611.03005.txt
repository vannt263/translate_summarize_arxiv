    "the effect of changes of concentration on the dynamics of ensembles has been studied before for muscle fibers @xcite , but not for the small ensembles relevant in the cytoskeleton , mainly because it is usually assumed that concentration in tissue cells is constant at a high level around @xmath7 .",
