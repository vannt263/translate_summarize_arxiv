    "comparing to the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 collisions , a @xmath32 collider is helpful and has some advantages to perform precise measurements for certain processes . to seek the @xmath19 events at the lhc is feasible , but its hadronic background is much noisy in comparison to a @xmath0 collider . in the hadronic production",
    ", the baryons are produced through scattering or annihilating or fusion of two initial partons inside the incident hadrons .",
    "in addition to the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , one also needs to take the extrinsic or intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms into consideration , especially at the small @xmath33 regions  @xcite .",
    "hence , the hadronic production becomes much more complicated due to the introduction of non - perturbative parton distribution functions and intrinsic components of the hadron ( even though they are universal ) . while at the @xmath2 collider , one only needs to consider the @xmath2 annihilation channel , @xmath34 , which allows one to study @xmath19 baryon s own properties .",
