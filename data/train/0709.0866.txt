    "the census of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is large enough to probe the links between mass of smbhs and the global properties of the host galaxies ( see for a review ( * ? ? ?",

    "we started a project aimed at measuring upper limits on  of smbhs that can be present in the center of all the nearby galaxies ( @xmath0 mpc ) for which stis / g750 m spectra are available in the hst archive .",

    "the stis / g750 m spectra were obtained with either the 02 @xmath4 52  or 01 @xmath4 52slit crossing the galaxy nucleus along a random position angle .",
    "the observed spectral region includes the , ,  emission lines .",
    "routine data reduction was performed . for each galaxy we obtained the nuclear spectrum by extracting a 025-wide aperture centered on the continuum peak .",
    "the ionized - gas velocity dispersion was measured by fitting gaussians to the broad and narrow components of the observed lines .",
    "we assumed that the ionized gas resides in a thin disk and moves into circular orbits .",
    "the local circular velocity is dictated by the gravitational influence of the putative smbh . in our model",
    "we neglected non - gravitational forces as well as the mass contribution of the stellar component . by taking into account for these effects ,",
    "we would obtain tighter upper limits on . to derive the upper limits on  we first built the gaseous velocity field and projected it onto the sky plane according to the disk orientation .",
    "then we observed it by simulating the actual setup of stis as done by @xcite .",
    "we have no information on the orientation of the gaseous disk within the central aperture .",
    "therefore , to reproduce the observed line width and flux radial profile we adopted two different inclinations of the gaseous disk that correspond to 68% upper and lower confidence limits for the  for randomly orientated disks ( figure [ ms ] ) .    and @xmath5 , respectively .",

    "for some galaxies of the sample , either upper limits ( ( * ? ? ?",
