    "the proposal @xcite and subsequent realization @xcite of optical lattices for the manipulation of ultra - cold atoms has attracted a great deal of research towards the implementation of quantum computation @xcite and the simulation of condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of optical lattices are their long decoherence times and high degrees of controllability .",
    "hence , one is able to probe phenomena that manifest themselves at higher orders in perturbation theory such as many body interactions @xcite .",
    "this gives the possibility to engineer and control exotic interactions in many body systems and subsequently realize novel phases of matter .",
    "examples include cases where frustration effects are present or competing phenomena coexist giving rise to large degeneracy structures @xcite . towards this direction",
    "we consider a semi - one dimensional lattice comprising a triangular ladder .",
    "the dynamics of two boson species mounting the optical lattice in the limit of strong collisional interactions can be effectively described by a chain of spin-@xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "here we consider systems with two and three spin interactions given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we shall see explicitly that it is possible to make @xmath3 dominant by appropriate tuning of the collisional and tunnelling couplings .",
    "as simple as these interactions may seem , when combined , they give rise to a rich variety of phase transitions , the study of which is the subject of this article .    in particular , we consider a hamiltonian that includes the two and three spin interactions with couplings @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , in the presence of a transverse field with unit amplitude .",
    "we observe that for @xmath6 the model is exactly solvable , as it reduces to the ising interaction with critical points at @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath8 we obtain a hamiltonian that is not analytically diagonalizable .",
    "nevertheless , a numerical study reveals a tricritical point at @xmath9 that is in the same universality class as the three - state potts model @xcite . when the two spin interaction is dominant the ground state has a spin - order of period 2 while the dominance of the higher order interaction brings about a spin - order of period 3 .",
    "though these phases are gapped , there are values of relative couplings where these orders compete , giving rise to a high degree of degeneracy .",
    "this characteristic allows for the presence of a gapless incommensurate chiral phase that extends to a wide range of parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : fidel ] the fidelity of the actual ground state of the hamiltonian is plotted against the ground state of each individual term comprising it . while we see that these agree for a large range of couplings",
    "there is an area between spin - order 2 and 3 where these states fail to accurately describe the nature of the system .",
    "we shall identify this as the gapless incommensurate chiral phase .",
    "a similar region has been presented by fendley , sengupta and sachdev @xcite in a 1-dimensional hard boson system .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ optical ] we present the realization of the two and three spin interactions by ultra - cold atoms superposed by optical lattices .",
    "section [ sec : tricritical ] is a study of the tricritical point present at @xmath10 . in section [ sec : general ]",
    ", we present the properties of the full hamiltonian . for",
    "that we employ perturbation theory , a bosonization of the model and a study of an effective field theory that eventually reveal the incommensurate chiral phase .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we conclude and present future directions .",
    ", of the ground state with the predictions obtained from each individual term of the hamiltonian .",
    "the state @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12 , @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath3 and @xmath14 corresponds to the transverse field .",
    "the state @xmath15 is the common ground state of @xmath12 and @xmath3 for this range of couplings .",
    "the spin chain is of length @xmath16.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "consider the physical setup where an ultra - cold atomic cloud of two different species , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is superposed with a three dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the atoms can tunnel through the potential barriers of the lattice from one site to the next with a coupling @xmath19 .",
    "when two or more atoms are present in the same site , they collide with coupling @xmath20 . for sufficiently large intensities of the laser radiation ,",
    "where @xmath21 , the system is in the mott insulator regime with a regular number of atoms per site . in particular , we can arrange the density of the atomic cloud to be low enough so that only one atom can exist at each site of the lattice , i.e. @xmath22 . in this way",
    "each lattice site is a simple two state system , that can be viewed as a spin-1/2 particle . within this representation",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written in terms of pauli spin operators .",
    "indeed , for the triangular ladder seen in figure [ chain ] we obtain the hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are all functions of the initial tunnelling and collisional couplings , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be controlled independently by varying @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , it is possible to make @xmath5 large compared to @xmath4 as can be seen in figure [ comb2 ] .",
    "a careful consideration of the system would reveal that terms of the form @xmath27 also appear , due to the triangular configuration .",
    "this can be remedied by employing superlattices that do not alter the other terms .",
    "ultimately , we would like to study the entire @xmath28 plane , identify the regions of criticality behavior and understand the global properties of the ground state . before turning to the general problem",
    "let us consider the two special limiting cases .",
    "initially , when @xmath6 , the hamiltonian reduces to the ising interaction between neighboring spins in the presence of a transverse magnetic field . this well - studied model exhibits criticality behavior for @xmath7 .",
    "another interesting model @xcite can be obtained for @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "we can take @xmath29 and consider the hamiltonian to be a function of the transverse field with amplitude @xmath24 @xcite . as we vary @xmath24 we observe that there are two distinctive regions . for @xmath30",
    ", the ground state has all the spins oriented towards the @xmath31 direction , and for @xmath32 there is a degeneracy between the states @xmath33 , its translations ( the @xmath34 symmetry ) and @xmath35 .",
    "it is of interest to study the behavior of the system between these two limiting cases .    due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian we can pinpoint where a possible critical point can lie .",
    "for that , one can define , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is easily verified @xcite that these operators obey the pauli algebra commutation relations . moreover , under this transformation the hamiltonian becomes @xmath38 which has exactly the same spectrum as @xmath39 .",
    "hence , if there exists a single critical point it has to be at @xmath40 .    we can verify this numerically and identify the critical exponents , by observing the minimum in the energy gap between the ground and first excited state on a finite chain of spins with periodic boundary conditions . in the thermodynamical limit",
    "this minimum , if it corresponds to a critical point , will become zero . near this region the energy gap , @xmath41 ,",
    "is expected to scale as follows @xcite , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a universal scaling function , @xmath44 is the dynamic critical exponent , and @xmath45 is the correlation length exponent .",
    "figure [ zzz1mod3_1](a ) gives a plot of @xmath46 versus @xmath24 , which shows that the energy minimum progresses towards @xmath47 for increasing @xmath48 .",
    "we may employ eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : delta ] ) to estimate @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ zzz1mod3_1](b ) shows @xmath49 against @xmath50 , where the data for systems of different sizes come together into a single curve . from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : delta ] ) we deduce the value of the critical exponents to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can also determine numerically the central charge of the critical theory and see if it corresponds to the same universality class .",
    "the central charge can be obtained by studying the scaling behavior of the entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the latter is given by the von neumann entropy , @xmath53 , of the reduced density matrix , @xmath54 .",
    "it can be calculated from the density matrix of the original system , being in a pure state , where all but @xmath55 contiguous spins are traced out .",
    "this indicates quantitatively the degree of entanglement of the @xmath55 spins with the rest of the chain .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath56 s_l & \\equiv & \\tr ( \\rho_l \\log \\rho_l ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the ground state of the system . for a critical configuration and for large",
    "l we expect @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory and @xmath60 is its complex conjugate .",
    "the central charge uniquely corresponds to the critical exponents of the energy and of the correlation length , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . we know",
    "that for non - critical chains @xmath53 should be saturated for large enough values of @xmath55 .",
    "this behavior is observed from the simulations when @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we are at @xmath62 we obtain figure [ fig : xzzz ] that shows the expected logarithmic progression . by a logarithmic fitting",
    "we can deduce that @xmath63 .",
    "hence , our model is in the same universality class as the three - state potts model and it corresponds to the critical exponents @xmath64 and @xmath65 in agreement with the earlier findings .",

    "we can now turn to the full hamiltonian for arbitrary values of the coupling parameters . for convenience we set @xmath47 and vary only the interaction couplings @xmath4 and @xmath5 . without loss of generality we can restrict on the @xmath66 half - plane as the case @xmath67",
    "is automatically obtained by exchanging @xmath68 .    for large values of @xmath25 or @xmath5",
    "it is possible to neglect the transverse field @xmath69 and treat the system classically .",
    "we find two asymptotes along which the ground state should undergo a first order phase transition . by introducing @xmath70 as a small perturbation",
    "one can predict how these curves behave when we approach the origin @xmath71 .",
    "we find that along the asymptote @xmath72 the classical ground state is highly degenerate : it is in fact infinitely degenerate in the thermodynamic limit . in the quantum regime , this gives rise to an intermediate region between the two phases with spin - order 2 and 3 , the size and nature of which will be studied in this section .      to understand the behavior of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "we shall employ perturbation theory .",
    "surprisingly , the second order perturbation will give a very good approximation to the numerical findings shown in figure [ fig : fidel ] .",
    "as a first step we take @xmath73 , thus neglecting the @xmath70 term the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath74 this hamiltonian has a classical behavior , so it can be solved exactly by examining eigenstates of @xmath75 .",
    "there are three regions on the @xmath76 plane of distinct ground state behavior .",
    "consider first @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the energy of the system is minimized uniquely by the state @xmath79 from the expectation values , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , one can calculate the energy per site to be @xmath82 .",
    "similarly we take the cases of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , resulting in the following ground states @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "observe that these states are @xmath91 and @xmath92 periodic respectively giving rise to @xmath34 and @xmath93 symmetries .",
    "to evaluate the position of the phase transitions we simply equate energies in neighboring regions . in this way",
    "we obtain the asymptotes @xmath94 and @xmath95 that separate the states of the system @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 as seen in figure [ perturbation ] .",
    "another classical region is obtained at @xmath99 , where the transverse field , @xmath70 , dominates . in this region",
    "the ground state is given by @xmath100 with @xmath101 and an energy per site of @xmath102 .",
    "we now consider the transverse field as a perturbation to the theory , so we rewrite our hamiltonian as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "cyclic permutations of states @xmath106 and @xmath107 are also ground states of the classical theory due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian . nevertheless , we need not employ degenerate perturbation theory at this point since the permutations behave identically under the transverse field , @xmath70 . for this hamiltonian",
    "the energies per site are @xmath108 @xmath109.\\ ] ] by inspection we see that the two energies are equal for @xmath110 , which coincides exactly with the classical solution . hence , at @xmath111 , the boundary between @xmath96 and @xmath97 remains unchanged , as seen in figure [ perturbation ] .",
    "let us turn to the perturbation treatment of the boundary between the @xmath112 and the @xmath96 states .",
    "in fact , to the second order in the couplings , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we find @xmath113 equating @xmath114 we obtain the corresponding boundary to be a correction of the classical one given by @xmath115 . the computational solution of @xmath114 is given in figure [ perturbation ] .",
    "it provides a line of second order phase transition joining the potts critical point and the ising critical point that fits firmly with the fidelity plot in figure [ fig : fidel ] .",
    "we saw above that for @xmath116 the period 2 and period 3 phases have the same ground state energy .",
    "interestingly , on this asymptote the two spin - orders can mix , giving rise in the thermodynamic limit to an infinitely degenerate ground state .",
    "a perturbation theory around this area is non - trivial as care has to be taken in the way the degeneracy is lifted . using a bosonization procedure similar to that presented in @xcite",
    ", we will calculate the spectrum of the theory up to second order in the transverse field .",
    "we will find a finite intermediate phase separating the period 2 and period 3 gapped phases .",
    "let us present in detail the bosonization procedure necessary to develop the perturbation theory .",
    "consider two new types of bosons ",
    "the @xmath117 , created by the @xmath118 operator , and @xmath119 , created by @xmath120 . in the spin formalism , @xmath117 corresponds to @xmath121 , while @xmath119 is equivalent to @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 all states that are composed of @xmath92s and @xmath91s are degenerate along the line @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the region of the phase diagram that we want to study is given by @xmath125 since there are no first order contributions in the perturbation theory , the region we want to study can be parameterized by @xmath126 for a dimensionless parameter @xmath127 .",

    "let us first work with @xmath128 bosons .",
    "the vacuum state has the form @xmath130 , with no @xmath91s . to construct the hamiltonian we need the self energy of a @xmath128 boson , the interaction energy and the hopping amplitude . for that",
