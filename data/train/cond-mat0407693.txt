    "nanostructured materials have attracted a lot of attention due to their commercial exploitation as sensors , batteries , toners in photocopying , quantum electronic devices , smart windows and memory applications .",
    "nanostructured magnetic materials are now being extensively studied for high capacity magnetic storage media , integrated circuits , color imaging , magnetic refrigeration , biomedical application and spintronics @xcite .",
    "the agglomeration in these magnetic nanoparticles due to vander waal s and magneto static interparticle interaction hampers their use for technological applications .",
    "several methods have been employed to reduce this problem of agglomeration , namely , blending colloidal nanomagnetic particles with polymers , coating of oxide particles with polymers like pva , pvp , pma etc .",
    ", forming a core shell structure or embedding the particles in a polymer matrix @xcite .",
    "these so called nanocomposites are also used in blend with conducting polymers like polypyrrole ( ppy ) , polyaniline ( pani ) etc .",
    "iron oxide - conducting polymer core shell nanocomposites which exhibit the properties of both constituents i.e. magnetic as well as conducting , have proved to be a useful material for many applications like electromagnetic shielding , gas and humidity sensors etc . @xcite .",
    "magnetic investigations on @xmath0 - ppy nanocomposites @xcite reveal that the size and hence the magnetic properties can be controlled by varying the ppy content in the nanocomposite .",
    "the properties of fine particle magnetic systems are known to be strongly dependent on the size , anisotropy and interactions like the exchange and dipolar @xcite .",
    "the effect of interparticle interactions in magnetic nanoparticle systems has been investigated by different authors @xcite . in magnetic nanocomposites",
    "these factors are easily controlled by varying the composition of the polymer .",
    "hence it is seen that all the magnetic properties of these systems are sensitive to polymer concentration .",
    "our earlier investigations on the @xmath0 polypyrrole nanocomposites reveal that superparamagnetic thresholds as evidenced by the presence of blocking are very high even for fairly small particles .",
    "our numerical simulations based on the random anisotropy , interacting model for single domain magnetic particle arrays also show that for a system with exchange interactions , as possible in a nanocomposite , has fairly high blocking even for particles sizes @xmath2 nm @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the preparation of magnetic nanocomposites of polyaniline and iron oxide . in order to determine the size , composition , structural and magnetic properties of the nanocomposite several investigations viz .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , hysteresis measurements and the low field ( applied field of @xmath3 oe and @xmath4 oe ) fc and zfc magnetization measurements have been carried out .",
    "we also perform monte carlo simulations on the interacting random anisotropy model using certain parameters derived from our experimental results , like the particle size and interparticle separation .",
    "the purpose of the simulation is to estimate the strength of typical exchange and anisotropy energies in this system .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the method of preparation , in section [ sec3 ] we present the characterization results . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present the magnetization studies , in section [ sec5 ] we describe the method and results of our simulation studies and in section [ sec6 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel process using ferric nitrate ( @xmath5 ) as precursor and 2-methoxy ethanol as solvent @xcite .",
    "these particles were further dispersed in a mixture of 10 cc deionized water , 50 cc of 1 m @xmath6 and .4 cc ( .39 gm ) of aniline monomer .",
    "the above solution was continuously stirred for 1 hour at ice temperature before adding the oxidant .",
    "agitation due to stirring reduces the agglomeration by breaking the big clusters into smaller ones .",
    "on addition of oxidant prepared by dissolving ammonium persulphate ( 1 gm ) in 20 ml distilled water at a rate of .08 ml / min , simultaneous polymerization and stirring leads to coating of pani chains on these smaller @xmath0 particles . to obtain coating of polyaniline 1 gm of @xmath0",
    "was dispersed in a mixture of @xmath7 cc deionized water and @xmath7 cc of @xmath8 m hcl .",
    "to the above dispersion @xmath9 cc ( @xmath10 gm ) of aniline monomers were added .",
    "this solution was maintained at @xmath11 c and constantly stirred for 1 hour .",
    "a solution containing @xmath8 gm of ammonium persulphate in @xmath12 cc of deionized water was added to the above .",
    "the reaction was continued for 4 hours with the solution placed in an ice water bath , after which it was filtered and washed repeatedly with @xmath8 m hcl till the disappearance of the color of the filtrate .",
    "subsequently it was washed with methanol and diethyl ether .",
    "the powder was allowed to dry at room temperature for 48 hours .",
    "it was observed that the color of the powder thus obtained for different concentrations of @xmath0 : pani ( like @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) changed from brown to dark green as the concentration of aniline monomer was increased .",
    "this shows the presence of a higher concentration of the polymer in the composite since pure polyaniline in its doped form is dark green in color .",
    "the crystal structure of the powder was examined by a rigaku rotaflex diffractometer using a @xmath18 ( @xmath19 a ) at 40 kev .",
    "the size and shape of the particles were analyzed by a jeol jem 2000 ex tem .",
    "the presence of the polymer was confirmed using a nicolet 510 p ftir spectrometer .",
    "a quantum design mpms-5s quantum design squid magnetometer was used for magnetic characterisation in the temperature range of @xmath20 k to @xmath21 k. for the zero field cooled ( zfc ) measurements the sample was cooled down to @xmath20 k in the absence of an external magnetic field followed by measurements in a constant magnetic field during the warming run of the experiments . in the field- cooled(fc ) measurments , the sample was cooled from @xmath21 k down to @xmath20 k in the presence of the same constant magnetic field which was also used in the subsequent warm up scan .",
    "the room temperature ( @xmath22 k ) hysteresis loop m(h ) was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm-5 , toei industry co. ltd .",
    "tokyo , japan ) , and the samples were subjected to a magnetic field cycling between @xmath23 tesla and @xmath24 tesla .",
    "fig.1 ( a ) - ( d ) show xrd pattern of different compositions of the @xmath0 : pan1 composite , unannealed , in varying ratios viz . 1:0 , 1:0.1 , 1:0.4 and 0:1 ( pure pani ) .",
    "peaks were observed at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with hkl values ( @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath28 ) , ( @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath30 ) which corresponds to the @xmath0 phase . the lattice constant was calculated to be a = 8.3452 @xmath31 .0001 awhich compares well with the literature value of 8.34 a @xcite . it was observed that with increase in concentration of polyaniline the intensity of peaks decreases and also some low intensity peaks are suppressed .",
    "this can be explained by the thicker coating of pani on iron oxide which suppresses the peaks at higher concentrations .",
    "but it can be seen that the same phase of iron oxide is retained in all the concentrations . for pure pani an amorphous nature",
    "is observed .",
    "the transmission electron micrograph tem in fig.2(a ) of unannealed iron oxide shows agglomerated clusters of iron oxide . in the presence of polymer",
    "the particle size reduces drastically as can be seen from fig.2(b ) which is a composite in the ratio @xmath15 i.e. a low concentration of polymer . the presence of polymer prevents agglomeration of the iron oxide and hence smaller clusters are observed for composites .",
    "there is still some agglomeration present due to the partial coating of the polymer .",
    "as the polymer concentration is doubled ( @xmath16 ) the @xmath0 particles were found to align in a chain as seen in fig .",
    "2(c ) . on further increasing",
    "polymer concentration intrachain structure starts building up , which is seen in fig .",
    "2(d ) which has a composition of @xmath17 .",
    "however the size of the particle is found to reduce further .",
    "in figure 3 we present the hysteresis measurements performed at room temperature for three different compositions .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic nanocomposites show a finite coercivity at room temperature for all the concentrations .",
    "this indicates that the system is still in the ferromagnetic regime , in spite of the small particle sizes .",
    "all the three systems show a tendency to saturate at @xmath32 tesla and the coercivities are in the range of @xmath33 oe .",
    "the saturation magnetization @xmath34 are found to be 53:37 ; 44.29 ; and 35.31 emu / gm for concentrations of 1:0.1 , 1:0.2 and 1:0.4 respectively , while the corresponding retentivities are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "the reduced value of the saturation magnetization for increasing polymer concentration is expected , due the presence of smaller quantities of @xmath0 in the sample . in the inset",
    "we have plotted the same data in the field range of @xmath39 to @xmath40 k. oe .",
    "the value of the coercivity is almost the same for all the concentrations indicating that the anisotropy energy of the magnetic particles is not much affected by the presence of polymer .",
    "the low value of the coercivity indicates that the system is close to superparamagnetic behavior .    in order to confirm the onset of the superparamagnetic phase ,",
    "zfc -fc magnetization measurements were performed for one of the above samples viz 1:0.4 for which the particle sizes seem to be very small ( fig .",
    "2(d ) ) and the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the measurements are performed at two different field strengths of 25 ( curve ( a ) ) and 100 oe ( curve ( b ) ) . at 100 oe",
    "the system seems to be closer to blocking at 300 k than at 25 oe .",
    "it is our belief that for systems of magnetic oxide nanoparticles which have a tendency to cluster , the blocking temperatures is not only decided by the particle size and anisotropy constant but also the exchange and dipolar interactions .",
    "large exchange interactions have a tendency to increase the blocking temperature , which we feel may be the case in these systems .",
    "the simulation is performed with an array of @xmath41 single domain magnetic particles positioned randomly in a cube of side @xmath42 .",
    "each particle has a magnetic moment vector @xmath43 and the direction of the easy axis of magnetization of the particle is represented by the unit vector @xmath44.the magnetic moment vector for a single particle has a temperature independent value @xmath45 where @xmath34 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath46 is the unit vector along the direction of magnetization .",
    "the volume of the particle @xmath47 is picked from a normal distribution @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the mean volume of the particle and @xmath50 is the width of the distribution which is taken to be @xmath51 .",
    "this is to account for the experimental results which show that the magnetic nanoparticles in the sample are ( i ) not all of the same shape and size and ( ii ) positioned randomly in the sample .",
    "the directions of the easy axis of magnetization of each particle is picked randomly , keeping in mind that the particles could have different shapes .",
    "such an array of interacting single domain magnetic nanoparticles can be described using the following hamiltonian , @xcite , @xmath52 the first term in eq .",
    "1 represents the anisotropy energy of the @xmath53 th magnetic particle which has an anisotropy constant @xmath54 .",
    "the second term is the exchange interaction energy between the different particles in the array and @xmath55 is the strength of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between two particles with localized magnetic moment vectors @xmath43 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the third term is the dipolar interaction between these particles , with @xmath57 as the distance between the i@xmath58 and j@xmath58 particles and @xmath59 the unit vector pointing along @xmath60 .",
    "the last term is the energy of the particles due to an externally applied magnetic field @xmath61 . for the purpose of simulation",
    "we assume that the exchange interaction has a site independent constant value @xmath62 .",
    "magnetization studies ( fc - zfc ) show that the blocking temperatures are very high , which is evident even in the hysteresis measurements .",
    "our earlier simulations @xcite suggests that the shape of the hysteresis curve ( fig.3 ) is typical of a system in which both exchange and dipolar interactions play a role .",
    "it is not possible to derive the value of either @xmath54 or @xmath63 from any of our experimental results .",
    "so for our simulation we use as an input the particle size and the typical interparticle distance , and try to obtain the experimentally observed coercivity and retentivity by varying the value of @xmath54 and @xmath63 .",
    "we work with a system of @xmath64 particles . the mean volume @xmath49 is taken to be equivalent to that of a sphere of radius @xmath65 nm .",
    "the dipolar interaction energy is calculated by summing over periodic repeats of the basic simulation cell by the method of lekner summation @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the hysteresis is performed at a temperature of @xmath66 k by the monte carlo method using the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the simulation is started at a very low field along the @xmath67- axis of the simulation cube , using an ensemble of magnetization vectors for the array , which gives a net magnetization of zero along the @xmath67 - direction .",
    "the system is saturated by gradually increasing the magnetic field up to a very high field which is sufficiently higher than its anisotropy field ( in this case 1.5 tesla ) .",
    "then the magnetic hysteresis loop is simulated . for each value of the magnetic field",
    "@xmath68 monte carlo steps are used for the thermalization of the system and the calculation of the net magnetization along the field direction is made over the next @xmath69 monte carlo steps .",
    "the results are averaged over five initial configurations of the magnetic particles(position , magnetization and easy axes directions ) .",
    "the values of @xmath70 amp / m for @xmath71 is taken from literature .",
    "to fit to the experimentally observed values of the coercivity and retentivity in these systems , we find that the anisotropy constant should be higher than for the pure @xmath0 system which is @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "a good fit to the experimental results are obtained for a much higher value of the anisotropy constant which is @xmath74 @xmath73 and a value of @xmath75 , where the mean anisotropy energy @xmath76 .",
    "the values of the anisotropy constant calculated from ac susceptibility measurements performed on coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles shows that the values of @xmath54 are sensitive to the coating material , and for small particles of @xmath0 and @xmath77 can be an order of magnitude larger than the values for bulk , in fact high as @xmath78 @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "so the value of @xmath54 estimated from the simulation is well within the experimentally reported limits for coated experimental oxides . in figure 5 .",
    "we show the results of the hysteresis simulations , by plotting the scaled magnetization @xmath79 with the applied field , for three different values of the anisotropy constant keeping @xmath49 , the interparticle distance and the exchange interaction same for all three curves .",
    "curve ( a ) is the experimental plot at @xmath66 k for the @xmath0 - pani concentration of @xmath80 .",
    "it is seen that the closest fit to the experimental curve is for a value of @xmath81 @xmath82 which is curve(c ) . for @xmath83 @xmath73 which is curve(d ) ,",
    "the coercivity is much larger than that observed experimentally and for @xmath84 @xmath73 ( curve ( d ) ) the coercivity is @xmath85 indicating the system is already superparamagnetic at @xmath66 k.    using the same parameters and the value of @xmath81 @xmath82 which is closest to the experimental curve , we simulate the fc- zfc magnetization curves which are shown in fig .",
    "the effect of a large @xmath54 is that the blocking temperatures @xmath86 k for @xmath87 oe , which again is in good agreement with the experimental result ( fig .",
    "4 ) , indicating that the values of @xmath54 and @xmath63 estimated from the hysteresis simulation are appropriate for the system being studied .",
    "the reasons for the high blocking temperatures even for such small particles are the presence of interactions .",
    "the broadness of the zfc peak is indicative of the size distribution in the sample .",
    "our experiments indicate that for fairly low concentrations of polyaniline in the nanocomposite , we are able to obtain large variation in the particle size and magnetic properties .",
    "the particle sizes are small and even at such low concentrations of polyaniline there is less agglomeration .",
    "high blocking temperatures as confirmed by hysteresis and zfc - fc magnetization measurements indicates that the system is in the ferromagnetic phase at room temperature",
    ". however the low value of coercivity suggests that the system is close to superparamagnetic behaviour .",
    "we are further investigating the electrical properties , like the conductivity and the dielectric behaviour of these nanocomposites to understand the contribution of the polymer in the system .",
