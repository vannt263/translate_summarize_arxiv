    "the main difference between a dust disk and a companion is the color of the infrared excess .    in this letter ,",

    "the observation was performed by using a 30 sec frame time in the setting of a random nine - point large - amplitude dithering .",
    "the total on target time was 270 sec in each irac channel .",
    "following data reduction procedures outlined in @xcite and @xcite , we used mopex to process each exposure and combine them into a final mosaic with a subsample of 2 in native pixels ( i.e. , 06 pixel @xmath5 ) .",

    "then we used routines in iraf to correct for atmospheric extinction and derived the sensitivity function for each echelle order using the flux standard feige 110 . because the goal of the observation is to detect narrow white dwarf photospheric features , the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is not relevant .",

    "the spectrum around selective elements is shown in figure [ fig : hires ] .",
    "we calculated a pure hydrogen nlte white dwarf model atmosphere using tlusty & synspec @xcite with the following parameters : t=27,220 k , log g=7.87 @xcite .",
    "because we are most interested in identifying infrared excess associated with the white dwarf , we scale its photospheric flux to ukirt j band .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sed ] , the observed flux in the infrared is much higher than predicted for the white dwarf s photosphere .",
    "we first fit the infrared excess with a flat , opaque disk model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the inner disk radius r@xmath9 varies between 10 r@xmath10 and 50 r@xmath10 and outer disk radius r@xmath11 = 40 r@xmath10 to 100 r@xmath10 both in steps of 1 r@xmath10 and the disk inclination @xmath12 increases from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 .",

    "there is no unique fit to the sed due to the degeneracy of the disk inclination and surface area ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we present the model with the smallest @xmath13 , as shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the required dust temperatures are and 960 k at the inner and outer radius , respectively .",
    "however , the model can not reproduce the high flux around irac-1 and w-1 and the low flux at irac-4 .",
    "in other dusty white dwarf systems , the irac-4 flux is typically higher or comparable to the irac-3 flux due to the adjacent 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission feature @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : color ] .",
    "it is puzzling that the irac-4 flux for pg 0010 + 280 is lower than the flux from a flat disk model .",
    "the infrared excess around pg 0010 + 280 can also be fit with a 1300 k blackbody , as shown in figure [ fig : sed ] . at a distance of 152 pc",
    ", it requires a radius @xmath14 of 9 @xmath15 10@xmath16 cm , about 1.3 radius of jupiter @xmath17 , which is possible for a substellar object . to explore this possibility",
    ", we fit the infrared excess with different models developed for brown dwarfs and exoplanet and find the best fit is the ames - dusty model with @xmath18=1300 k , log g=4.0 and @xmath14=1.3 r@xmath2 ( correspondingly a mass of 10 @xmath19 , @xcite ) .",
    "we defer the further discussion to section 3.3 .",
    "no absorption lines from heavy elements were detected in the hires spectrum of . to derive the upper limits",
    ", we used the same atmospheric model calculated from tlusty & synspec @xcite with atomic data for individual lines from the vienna atomic line database @xcite .",
    "the computed lines were convolved with a gaussian function to represent the instrument broadening .",
    "the upper limits are listed in table [ tab : abundances ] and some representative spectra are shown in .",
    "at such a high stellar temperature , there is no convection zone and the usual definition for settling times becomes very arbitrary @xcite .",
    "instead , we calculate the accretion rate of each element in table [ tab : abundances ] , following @xcite and assuming the system is in a steady state ( d. koester , private communication ) .",
    "so far , pg 0010 + 280 is the only white dwarf with a 3 - 8 @xmath0 m excess but no detection of heavy elements .",
    "however , it is not entirely unexpected .",
    "the optical line strength decreases significantly with increasing stellar temperatures @xcite . for pg 0010 + 280 ,",
    "the magnesium upper limit is the most stringent and we assume magnesium is 15% of the total mass of the material  the average number in other dusty white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the total accretion rate would be 1.2 @xmath15 10@xmath20 g s@xmath5 , which is relatively low given dusty hydrogen - atmosphere white dwarfs have an average accretion rate of @xcite .",
    "future observations , particularly with hst / cos which is more sensitive to trace elements , would reveal whether heavy elements are present in the atmosphere .",
    "if the infrared excess comes from a dust disk , pg 0010 + 280 , at a temperature of , would be the hottest dusty white dwarf .",
    "the previous record is wd j1537 + 5151 at 24,900 k @xcite . because the disk is opaque , due to mutual shielding ,",
    "the grains reach a much lower temperature compared to a blackbody .",
    "the sublimation radius can be calculated using equation ( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "assuming a sublimation temperature of 1200 k , the sublimation radius is 38 r@xmath10 , which is well within the tidal radius .",
    "the innermost region of the dust disk is directly exposured to the starlight and the temperature can be much higher .",
    "@xcite studied this particular region and found that a higher dust temperature is possible in the high metal pressure .",
    "it is possible to have a dust disk at a temperature of 27,220 k for pg 0010 + 280 .",
    "the presence of dust disks around young white dwarfs is favored by dynamical simulations , which predict a decline of tidal disruption event as the white dwarf cools .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the peak of accretion happens at a white dwarf cooling age of 30 myr and stellar temperature of .",
    "the degree of pollution is also observed to decrease as the white dwarfs age and only two dusty white dwarfs have a temperature lower than 10,000 k @xcite .",
    "the sed of pg 0010 + 280 can also be fit with a substellar object at 1300 k , 1.3 r@xmath2 and within of the white dwarf .",
    "there are a few possibilities .    * a cool brown dwarf . however , a radius of 1.3 r@xmath2 is too big for a brown dwarf that has been cooling for 2.3 gyr .",
    "for example , @xcite derived a radius of 0.86 r@xmath2 for such a brown dwarf , which is about 50% smaller than required to fit the sed . * a re - heated brown dwarf .",
    "a brown dwarf might accrete a substantial amount of mass during the red giant stage and would appear to have a similar age as the white dwarf cooling age @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the substellar object would be @xmath1 3000 k , which is too hot to fit the sed .",
    "* an irradiated substellar object .",
    "assuming the temperature of the object is in thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation , it would be located at 220 r@xmath10 ( 0.015 au ) to be 1300 k. the orbital period is 21 h. the substellar object would be outside of the tidal radius , which is typically 100 r@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a narrow h@xmath21 emission core can be visible during part of the orbital period , as has been detected around wd 0137 - 349 and its companion @xcite .",
    "h@xmath21 was covered in our hires / red setting in two consecutive exposures , each 40 minutes long .",
    "no emission core was detected .",
    "however , we do not have enough time coverage to rule out this possibility . * a giant planet . at an age of",
    ", a planet would be too cool to be detectable . * a re - heated giant planet .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of giant planets around post - main - sequence stars and found they can be significantly re - heated due to accretion of stellar material . at a radius of 1.3 r@xmath2 ,",
    "it is similar to the values derived for inflated extrasolar giant planets @xcite .",
    "this recent accretion would leave a huge amount of dust in the atmosphere of the substellar objects  the prerequisite for ames - dusty model . while for other typical substellar objects at 1300 k , the best fit model has little dust contribution @xcite .",
    "+ for the potential substellar object to remain `` hot '' and display significant infrared excess at the white dwarf cooling age @xmath22 of 16 myr , it needs to accrete at least the mass of @xmath23m@xmath24 , + @xmath25 + where g is gravitational constant .",
    "m@xmath24 , l@xmath24 and r@xmath24 represents the mass , luminosity and radius of the substellar object .",
    "assuming its effective temperature t@xmath24 has remained the same since the start of white dwarf cooling , it can be calculated as , + @xmath26 + for a substellar object as massive as 10 jupiter mass , it needs to accrete at least of material to remain hot after 16 myr .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath1 3% of its own mass and @xmath1 0.02% of the total mass loss by the 1.8 m@xmath27 main - sequence progenitor star .",
    "depending on the location of the object and the mass loss scenario , this hypothesis could be possible .",
    "due to possible accretion of carbon - rich material , the composition of the object s atmosphere could be substantially modified and display ch@xmath28 and co @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy in the near - infrared might detect some signatures from a substellar object and reveal the nature of the infrared excess .",
    "we report the discovery of infrared excess around pg 0010 + 280  the hottest and youngest white dwarf displaying a 3 - 8 @xmath0 m excess .",
    "its unique infrared color as well as the non - detection of heavy elements with high - resolution spectroscopic observations suggest a possible alternative origin than white dwarfs with infrared excess from a circumstellar disk . from fitting the sed , we can not exclude models of either an opaque dust disk within the tidal radius or a substellar object at 1300 k , from an irradiated object or a re - heated planet .",
