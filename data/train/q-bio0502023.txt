    "a role for modification of activation functions , or intrinsic plasticity ( ip ) , for behavioral learning has been demonstrated for a number of systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , in rabbit eyeblink conditioning , when ion channels related to afterhyperpolarization are being suppressed by a learning event , they can become permanently suppressed .",
    "this has been shown for pyramidal cells of hippocampal areas ca1 and ca3 , and for cerebellar purkinje cells @xcite . in some cases , these changes are permanent and still present after 30 days @xcite , in other cases , intrinsic changes disappear after 3 - 7 days , while the behavioral memory remains intact , raising questions about the long - term component of intrinsic plasticity in these systems .",
    "there are at the present time conflicting ideas on the significance of ip compared to synaptic plasticity @xcite , and the range of functions that ip may have in adaptivity @xcite .",
    "few computational models have been proposed that show how modification in activation functions can be achieved with ion channel based models of realistic single neurons .",
    "marder and colleagues have developed an approach , where they sample a very large parameter space for conductances of ion channels , exploring nonlinearities in the relation between conductances and neural spiking behavior @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this research are observations about neuromodulation and intrinsic plasticity in specific neurons of an invertebrate ganglion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they have noted that large variations in some parameters may have little effect on neuronal behavior , while comparatively small variations in certain regions in parameter space may change response properties significantly .",
    "they also suggest that neuromodulation may provide an efficient means of targeting regions in parameter space with significant effects on response properties @xcite .",
    "a study by @xcite assumed the goal of modification of activation functions is to achieve an optimal distribution of firing rates for a population of neurons .",
    "the idea was that by tuning each neuron to a different band of the frequency spectrum , the full bandwidth of frequencies could be employed for information transfer .",
    "this goal was achieved by adjusting @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels for a generically defined neuron until a desired frequency was stably reached .",
    "we present a different approach , where the modification of activation functions reflects the history of exposure to stimuli for a specific neuron .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that synaptic ltp / ltd and linear regulations of intrinsic excitability could operate in a synergistic fashion .",
    "however , in our approach , different types of synaptic stimulation result in state changes for the neuronal unit , influencing its capacity for read - out of stored intrinsic properties .",
    "thus , intrinsic plasticity is conceptualized as fundamentally different from ltp / ltd which does not encompass such a state change .",
    "the learning rule that we derive as the basis for adjustment concerns one - dimensional upregulation or down - regulation of excitability in the `` read - out '' state of the neuron , and affecting only this state .",
    "this rule uses neural activation , significantly determined by intracellular calcium for the learning parameter , which can be shown to be biologically well - motivated ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "the membrane voltage @xmath3 is modeled as @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the individual currents are modeled by conductances , state variables and the reversal potential : @xmath5 the dynamics are defined using state variables for activation ( @xmath6 ) and inactivation ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "physiological ranges for @xmath38 can be estimated by various means .",
    "there are measurements for variability in eletrophysiologically defined membrane behavior ( current threshold , spike response to current pulses etc .",
    "@xcite ) that are typically expressed as standard errors ( e.g. 16 - 20% for current threshold , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also attempts at classifying msn cells into different types based on their electrophysiological profile @xcite .",
    "modeling shows that variability of ion channel conductances with a range of @xmath40 matches measures of electrophysiological variability and reproduces the ranges for msn types ( data not shown ) .",
    "interestingly , direct measurements for dopamine d1 receptor - mediated changes on ion channel conductances are approximately in the same ranges ( @xmath41 , @xcite ) .",
    "our discussion is thus based on an estimate of @xmath38 ranging fom 0.6 - 1.4 for each channel .",
    "synaptic input is defined by overlays of the epsps generated by n individual poisson - distributed spike trains with mean interspike interval @xmath42 .",
    "each epsp is modeled as a spike with peak amplitude @xmath43 and exponential decay with @xmath44 similar to @xcite .",
    "ipsps are modeled in a similar way with @xmath45 .",
    "this corresponds to 0.5na ( -0.2na ) as peak current ( with @xmath46 ) .",
    "synaptic conductances are calculated by @xmath47 with @xmath48 set to 0mv .",

    "this is @xmath52 or @xmath53 , which corresponds to the experimentally measured average value for the rheobase in @xcite .",
    "we may increase the correlation in the input by using a percentage @xmath54 of neurons which fire at the same time .",
    "higher values for @xmath54 increase the amplitude of the fluctuations of the input ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the simulator has been implemented in matlab and executed on an apple 1ghz g4 notebook .",
    "the entire code is interpreted and no specific code optimizations have been applied . for numerical integration , the solver ode45 was used .",
    "simulation of one neuron for 1 s took approximately 68s cpu time .",
    "it is expected that for compiled and optimized code the simulation speed could be increased by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "we explore the impact of small variations in ion channel conductances on the shape of the activation function . as an example , we show the current and conductance changes for a slowly inactivating a - type k+ channel ( kv1.2 , @xmath32 ) , l - type calcium channel ( @xmath31 ) and inward rectifying k+ channel ( @xmath34 ) at different membrane potentials modulated by a scaling factor @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ kas - conductance ] , fig .  [ actfun ] ) .",
    "regulation of the voltage - dependence @xcite and even of the inactivation dynamics of an ion channel @xcite has also been shown , but these effects are not further discussed here .",
    "we can see that there are critical voltage ranges ( around -50mv , around -80mv and starting at -40mv ) , where the conductance and the current are highest , and where scaling has a significant effect , while scaling has small or no effect in other voltage ranges .",
    "( the na+ current has been disabled for this example to prevent the neuron from firing ) .    in fig .",
    "[ temporal ] , we show the current over time - to graphically display the slow dynamics of the @xmath32 and @xmath31 channel . since we do not change the activation - inactivation dynamics of any channel in our model , we show currents only for @xmath56 , @xmath57 = 1 .",
    "we can see that @xmath32 activates moderately fast ( 20ms ) , while it inactivates with a half - time of about 300ms , depending on the voltage . for @xmath31 , activation is almost instantaneous , but inactivation is @xmath58 500ms .    the activation function for the msn model shows a time - dependence only in the high - voltage range ( at or above -55mv ) , whereas the components in the lower voltage ranges are not time - dependent .",
    "mathematically , we can consider the individual channels as a set of basis functions that allow function approximation for the activation function .",
    "each particular adjustment of an activation function can be considered learning of a filter which is suited to a specific processing task .",
    "the activation - inactivation dynamics would provide a similar set of basis functions for the temporal domain . of course , it is interesting to note which particular basis functions exist , and also how the temporal dimension is tied in with specific voltage - dependences",
    ". for instance , the slowly inactivating potassium channel @xmath32 provides a skewed mirror image of the function of calcium - gated sk / bk channels , which are responsible for afterhyperpolarization , making different variants of frequency filters possible . on this basis",
    ", a mapping of ion channel components and their density or distributions in different types of neurons could provide an interesting perspective on direct interactions for neurons from different tissue types or brain areas , as well as e.g. between cholinergic interneurons and msns within striatum .    to further explore the influence of variability of the activation function",
    ", we apply realistic synaptic input with different amounts of correlation to individual ms neurons ( see fig .",
    "[ currentgsyn ] ) .",
    "this shows us that small adjustments in the contribution of a specific ion channel can result in significantly different spiking behavior even for identical synaptic input .",
    "this occurs when the input is distributed , i.e. has low correlation . in this case",
    ", the neurons spike independently of each other and with different frequencies .",
    "we can eliminate this effect by increasing the correlation of the input .",
    "because of the slow activation / inactivation dynamics of the @xmath32 channel , ( latency of @xmath59 20ms ) only low correlated input activates these channels ( neuronal integrator mode ) , but highly correlated inputs do not activate these channels , driving the membrane to spiking quickly ( coincidence detector mode ) .",
    "therefore correlated input can produce reliable spiking behavior for model neurons which differ in the relative contribution of the slow @xmath32 channel .",
    "distributed input , in contrast , activates slower ion channels , and can produce different tonic firing rates , here according to the contribution of the @xmath32 channels , as long as strong synaptic input keeps the neuron in the relevant voltage range ( persistent activity ) .",
    "similarly , the differential contribution of other channels ( high - voltage gated l - type ca - channels , hyperpolarization - activated girk channels or calcium - dependent sk / bk channels ) will affect neuronal behavior , when the conditions for a prominent influence of these channels are met .",
    "we are modeling a state of ms neurons that exhibits regular tonic firing .",
    "in experimental studies , @xcite showed that ms neurons , similar to cortical neurons , exhibit upstate - downstate behavior , reminiscent of slow - wave sleep , under certain forms of anesthesia ( ketamine , barbiturate ) . however , under neurolept - analgesia ( fentanyl - haloperidol ) , @xcite showed that ms neurons can show driven activity , when cortical input is highly synchronized , and exhibit a state characterized by fluctuating synaptic inputs without rhythmic activity ( i.e. without upstates / downstates ) , when cortical input is desynchronized .",
    "the regular , tonic spiking in this state is very low , much less than in the waking animal , which may be related to the dopamine block by haloperidol .",
    "this makes a waking state of ms neurons characterized by regular tonic spiking at different firing rates probable .    in the following ,",
    "we show how intrinsic excitability adaptation can lead to different recalled firing rates under appropriate synaptic stimulation . the model could thus reflect learning that is recalled or read out during msn states under desynchronized cortical input - in contrast to highly synchronized input , which would homogenize the response of the coincidence detecting neurons and favor reliable transfer of spikes .",
    "the general idea for learning intrinsic plasticity is to use a learning parameter @xmath7 for each individual update of the conductance scaling factor @xmath38 .",
    "the _ direction _ of learning ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) is determined from the neural activation ( @xmath62 ) for each individual neuron .",
    "neural activation is largely determined by intracellular calcium but here we estimate the neural activation @xmath62 from the spike rate of the neuron , measured over 1 s of simulated behavior ( see [ biolearn ] for a discussion ) .",
    "we define a bidirectional learning rule dependent on an initial firing rate @xmath63 : excitability is increased by a step function @xmath7 ( with stepsize @xmath64 ) when @xmath62 is greater than @xmath63 , excitability is decreased when @xmath62 is lower than @xmath63 ( `` positive learning '' ) .",
    "this means , when the actual neural activation is higher than the initial firing rate , membrane adaptations aim to move the neuron to a higher excitability in order to create a positive memory trace of a period of high activation ( which can then be replicated under distributed synaptic stimulation ) .",
    "the same mechanism applies to lower the excitability of a neuron .",
    "@xmath65    this rule can also be implemented by individual increases in excitability after each action potential , and decreases of excitability for periods of time without action potentials .",
    "initial experiments @xcite indeed show such adaptation of intrinsic excitability after individual spikes .    the function @xmath7 can be applied to a single ion channel , such as @xmath32 , but also to a number of ion channels in parallel : e.g. to mimic dopamine d1 receptor activation , @xmath7 may be applied to @xmath56 ( upregulated with high @xmath62 ) , @xmath66 ( downregulated with high @xmath62 ) , and @xmath57 ( downregulated with high @xmath62 ) .",
    "we can show the effect of this learning rule on pattern learning .",
    "we generate synaptic inputs from a grid of 200 input neurons for a single layer of 10 msns . on this grid",
    "we project two stripes of width 4 as a simple input pattern @xmath67 by adjusting the mean interspike interval ( isi ) for the corresponding input neurons to a higher value ( @xmath68 ms for _ on _ vs. @xmath69 ms for _ off _ neurons , see fig .",
    "[ toplo ] ) .",
    "we apply the learning rule to each of the currents @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this mimics changes in dopamine d1 receptor sensitivity , which targets these ion channels .",
    "adaptation can be weaker or stronger , depending on learning time ( e.g. , @xmath64=0.01 , @xmath70=20s ( 20 steps ) ( weak ) , @xmath70=40s ( 40 steps ) ( strong ) ) .",
    "after a number of steps , we achieve a distribution of @xmath38-values that reflects the strength of the input ( table  [ table3 ] a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ positive ] , we obtain spike frequency histograms from the set of ms neurons under different conditions . fig .",
    "[ positive ] a shows the naive response to the input pattern @xmath67 - high activation in two medial areas . after adaptation , this response",
    "is increased ( fig .",
    "[ positive ] b ) . when we apply a test input of a random noise pattern @xmath71 , we see that the learned pattern is still reflected in the spike histogram ( fig .",
    "[ positive ] c ) .",
    "for positive learning , this process is theoretically unbounded , and only limited by the stepsize and the adaptation time .",
    "a saturation state could be defined to prevent unbounded learning , which would also allow to perform capacity calculations .",
    "we should note that applying just one pattern continuously results in a very simple learning trajectory : each update results in a step change in the relevant ion channel currents .",
    "however , we also show that the effects of stepwise adaptation of individual ion channels do not necessarily lead to a completely parallel adaptation of firing rate . in fig .",
    "[ positive ] we see that adaptation is much stronger for high input rather than low input neurons . in this case , @xmath63 at 11.5hz is a fairly low value for neurons to continue to lower their firing rate with stepwise adaptation of the chosen ion channels .",
    "this shows the importance of using appropriate tuning ( harnessing ) mechanisms to make highly nonlinear channels work in a purely linear learning context .",
    "clearly one of the results of learning is an altered spiking behavior of individual neurons dependent on their history .",
    "it is important to realize that this rule is based on neural activation , not synaptic input as a learning parameter - since synaptic input is constant during learning .",
    "we show that this mechanism can be employed not only for positive trace learning , when excitability adaptation corresponds to frequency response , but also for negative trace learning , when excitability adaptation counteracts frequency response and approximates a target firing rate @xmath63 .",
    "this target rate could be set as a result of global inhibitory mechanisms corresponding to the expected mean @xmath72 values under physiological stimulation .",
    "accordingly , the neuron responds with decreases of excitability to high input ranges and increases of excitability to low input ranges ( fig .  [ negative ] ) .",
    "@xmath73    this emphasizes that `` homeostatic '' responses - adjusting excitability in the opposite direction to the level of input - can implement trace learning ( pattern learning and feature extraction ) as well .",
    "negative learning rule results in a mirror image of parameter values compared to positive learning , as shown in table  [ table3 ] b. the naive response is the same as before ( fig .",
    "[ positive ] a ) . but here , after adaptation , the neurons have habituated to the input , and do not produce a strong response anymore ( fig .",
    "[ neg2 ] a ) . when neurons are tested with @xmath71 , an inverse version of the original pattern appears ( fig .",
    "[ neg2 ] b ) .",
    "similarly , when we apply a different pattern @xmath74 , we obtain a spike histogram , where the learned pattern is overlayed with the new input , resulting in a dampening of the frequency response for @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ neg2 ] c ) .    for both positive and negative traces ,",
    "learning is pattern - specific , i.e. training with homogeneous , fluctuating ( high - low ) noise , such as @xmath71 , results in no adjustments ( or computes an average ) .",
    "however , any prolonged sequence of neuron - selective stimulation results in neuron - selective patterns .",
    "this requires the population to be protected from prolonged stimulation with random patterns in a biological setting .",
    "we may assume most patterns to be meaningful and highly repetitive , while the neuron exists in a plastic state , while patterns may be random , when the neuron is not plastic ( because it is stimulated with highly correlated or very low frequency input , saturated in its parameters or undergoes ion channel block by selected neuromodulators ) .",
    "a number of experimental results show that intrinsic plasticity in msns may be prominently induced and regulated by intracellular calcium : it has been shown that e.g. the regulation of delayed rectifier @xmath1-channels ( kv2.1 channels ) is effectively performed by @xmath75 influx and calcineurin activation in cultured hippocampal neurons , which can be achieved by glutamate stimulation @xcite .",
    "the regulation concerns marked dephosphorylation ( reduction of conductance ) plus a shift in voltage - dependence .",
    "it has also been shown that 20 s of nmda stimulation , or alternatively , increase of intracellular calcium , increases functional dopamine d1 receptor density at the membrane , which corresponds to an alteration in @xmath76 for d1 parameters , targeting a number of ion channels simultaneously @xcite . for deep cerebellar neurons",
    ", there has recently been some direct evidence on the conditions that induce intrinsic plasticity . here",
    ", alterations in intrinsic excitability can be induced by bursts of epsps and ipsps , accompanied by dendritic calcium transients @xcite . in striatal msns , it has been determined that synaptic stimulation at 1 hz does not cause significant calcium signals , but 10 hz stimulation causes moderate increases , and higher stimulation ( up to 100hz ) significantly raises calcium levels @xcite . in the simulations , neural activation ( @xmath62 )",
    "is estimated from the number of spikes generated , measured over the simulated behavior . in the model case ,",
    "the membrane potential is not used as a separate parameter , because membrane potential and spiking behavior are closely linked . however ,",
    "when a neuron exhibits prominent upstates ( periods of high membrane voltages with a variable number of actual spikes ) , membrane potential may need to be treated as an additional , independent component of @xmath62 , since a great part of the intracellular calcium signal in striatal msns is being generated from high - voltage activated nmda and l - type calcium channels @xcite .",
    "the number of spikes produced nonetheless seems important because of the phenomenon of backpropagating spikes .",
    "backpropagating spikes enhance the calcium signal , thus providing a basis for a prominent role for spiking behavior , or firing rate , for defining intracellular calcium .",
    "the presence of backpropagation of spikes has recently been confirmed for msns @xcite .    in general , the induction of intrinsic plasticity may be linked not only to intracellular calcium .",
    "there exists an intricate intracellular system of interactions between diffusible substances like calcium and camp , as well as a number of crucial proteins ( rgs , calcineurin , pka , pkc , other kinases and phosphatases ) for regulating receptor sensitivity and ion channel properties , which are furthermore influenced by nm receptor activation .",
    "thus the learning parameter @xmath7 may be analyzed as being dependent not only on @xmath62 , but also on @xmath39 $ ] , and possibly even a third variable for a - slowly changing - intracellular state .",
    "learning by intrinsic excitability seems particularly suitable for striatal msns , since they have few lateral connections , which provide only a small part of their total input @xcite .",
    "when we have strong recurrent interaction , as in cortex , intrinsic excitability learning needs to adjust activation functions relative to each other , e.g. to ensure optimal distribution of activation functions .",
    "this probably happens in the cortical maps , such as frequency maps in auditory cortex @xcite .    in hippocampus ,",
    "synaptic and intrinsic modulation may potentiate each other ( e - s potentiation , @xcite ) , but in other systems ( e.g. striatum ) antagonistic regulation may also exist ( such as ltd combined with positive learning ) , with effects on the balance of synaptic vs. whole - cell localization for the storage of information .      when ion channels are regulated by neuromodulation , we can use a factor @xmath39 \\kappa$ ] - where @xmath39 $ ] is the extracellular concentration of the ligand and @xmath76 the receptor sensitivity ( see [ variability ] , eq .  [ eq : mu - kappa - factors ] ) .",
    "@xmath76 stands for the influence that a nm signal of a certain strength has on a particular ion channel , i.e. the degree of coupling between nm receptor ligand binding and ion channel modification @xcite .",
    "typically , a signal @xmath39 $ ] will regulate several ion channels in parallel , but there may be different @xmath77 for each ion channel . if activation function adaptation proceeds by nm - activated @xmath76 parameters , rather than unconditioned @xmath38 parameters , response to stimuli will consist of an early , non - modulated component , where the input pattern is reflected directly in the spiking frequency , and a later , modulated component , where habituation occurs for a learned pattern , or the stored pattern is reflected by overlaying a new stimulus and the stored pattern .",
    "nm signals orchestrate both adjustments in activation function and synaptic input , with nm activation often depressing synapses , but increasing the variability in the activation function through selected conductance changes ( activating @xmath76-parameters ) . as a result , the input component of the signal is reduced in comparison to the stored intrinsic component after nm activation . presumably , this has a dynamic component , such that for a short time after a strong signal there is an input - dominant phase which is then followed by an intrinsic - dominant phase .",
    "there are different ideas at the present time what intrinsic plasticity can achieve within a network model of neuronal interaction .",
    "a recent review of intrinsic plasticity @xcite has left the authors wondering , whether ip acts mainly to maintain homeostasis , adapting to changes in synaptic strength by keeping neurons within certain ranges but without significant informational capacity , as in the model of @xcite . however , as we have shown , homeostatic adaptation does not exclude information storage under conditions of conditional read - out .",
    "the synergy between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity may take different forms , beyond e - s potentiation .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , @xcite have listed many possible functions and roles of intrinsic adaptive plasticity , based on a review of experimental evidence in different systems .",
    "we have greatly simplified the exposition here by concentrating on spike frequency as a major indicator of neural behavior .",
    "certainly the type of firing ( e.g. burst firing ) is also under control of neuromodulators , and may be influenced by the distribution and density of ion channels .",
    "single neuron computation is more complex than what can be shown with a single compartment model . in dendritic computation",
    ", the coupling of different compartments may be prominently affected by intrinsic plasticity .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed a loss of clustering for k+ channels on the membrane , induced by high glutamate stimulation , indicating a possible input - dependent regulation of dendritic integration .",
    "a recent study on concurrent simulation of synaptic coupling parameters and intrinsic ion channel conductances has concluded that intrinsic and synaptic plasticity can achieve similar effects for network operation @xcite .",
    "we have suggested that synaptic and intrinsic plasticity can substitute for each other , and furthermore that this essential functional parallelism could be an indication for _ information flow _ over time from one modality to the other @xcite .",
    "the direction of this information flow may be from intrinsic to synaptic for the induction of permanent , morphological changes ( such as dendritic spine morphology ) - however the results of @xcite in cerebellum have also shown the possibility of permanent intrinsic plasticity ( albeit in purkinje cells which lack nmda receptors and thus may be highly atypical neurons concerning learning properties ) .",
    "clearly the interaction between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity is still an open question .",
    "here we have shown a simple , local learning mechanism for intrinsic plasticity that allows to store pattern information without synaptic plasticity .",
    "this is different from theoretical approaches , where activation functions are only being modulated to optimize global measures of information transmission between neurons while the information is exclusively stored in synaptic weights .",
    "further work will be needed to investigate the smooth integration of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity and their respective functions in different systems .",
    "we wanted to show quantitatively that ip can have significant effects on spike frequency , dependent on the statistical structure of the input .",
    "in particular , low correlated input , or input during sensitive ( high - voltage membrane ) states induces the strongest variability of spike responses for different activation functions , while highly correlated input acts as drivers for neurons , eliminating subtle differences in activation function . we suggested that starting from a very general , natural format for a learning rule , which can be biologically motivated , we arrive at simple pattern learning , the basis for feature extraction , and realistic types of neural behavior : population - wide increases / decreases of neural firing rates to novel input stimuli , habituation to known stimuli and history - dependent distortions of individual stimuli . a significant application of this theoretical model exists in the observation of pervasive whole - cell adaptations in selected ion channels ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 ) after cocaine sensitization @xcite , with implications of the type of learning that underlies addiction .",
    "this would reduce the dynamic range of intrinsic plasticity .",
    "potentially , then , learning in striatum is mediated in part by intrinsic plasticity , and a reduction in inducible intrinsic plasticity or dynamic range of intrinsic plasticity after cocaine sensitization may contribute to the pathology of addiction .",
