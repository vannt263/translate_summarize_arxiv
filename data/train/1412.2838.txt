    "historically , quantum entanglement has been one of the most fascinating but controversial features of quantum mechanics , since einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pointed out that performing a local measurement may affect the outcome of local measurements instantaneously beyond the lightcone in 1935  @xcite .",
    "it was aspect et al s experiment that caused a paradigm shift in 1981 .",
    "they performed a convincing test that the quantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics by measuring correlations of linear polarizations of pairs of photons  @xcite . since then ,",
    "more interest has been paid to how to make use of quantum entanglement of epr pairs in quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "entanglement entropy has proved to be a useful quantitative measure of entanglement of a quantum system . nowadays",
    ", entanglement entropy has become a useful tool in understanding phenomena in condensed matter physics , quantum information and high energy physics .",
    "nonetheless , the actual calculation of the entanglement entropy in quantum field theories has not been an easy task .",
    "ryu and takayanagi made great progress recently by discovering a powerful method of calculating the entanglement entropy of a strongly coupled quantum field theory with a gravity dual using holographic techniques  @xcite .",
    "their formula has so far passed many consistency checks .    in order to discuss the gravitational dual of the entanglement entropy in a quantum field theory in the bunch - davies vacuum in de sitter space , maldacena and",
    "pimentel developed an explicit method in @xcite .",
    "their method was also extended to @xmath7-vacua in @xcite .",
    "the quantum entanglement could exist beyond the size of the hubble horizon if a pair of particles created within causally connected hubble horizon size region was separated off by the de sitter expansion .",
    "in fact , this research showed that two causally disconnected regions in de sitter space are entangled .",
    "this suggests that vacuum fluctuations observed in our universe may be entangled with those in another part of the multiverse .",
    "in fact , by using the reduced density matrix derived in @xcite , it was found that the quantum entanglement affects the shape of the spectrum on large scales comparable to or greater than the curvature radius in @xcite .",
    "this could be an observational signature of the multiverse .    in an era of precision cosmology",
    ", observational technologies may provide further understanding of our universe by making use of quantum entanglement .",
    "indeed , there are some attempts to apply the effect of quantum entanglement to cosmology , with a variety of motivations and formalisms in @xcite . also , the results of @xcite suggest that the frame of bubble nucleation is observer dependent , determined by the rest frame of the observer , so the quantum entanglement produced in the process of bubble nucleation may be observer dependent as well .",
    "to reveal such an observer dependence of the quantum entanglement in the multiverse is one of our motivations of this work .",
    "another motivation is to understand the result of @xcite better in the multiverse picture .",
    "inflationary cosmology and the string landscape suggest that our universe may not be the only universe but part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse @xcite . until recently",
    ", however , this multiverse idea has been criticized as a philosophical proposal that can not be tested .",
    "however , there may be quantum entanglement between two causally separated universes in the multiverse , and it may produce detectable signatures as demonstrated in @xcite . in the structure of the multiverse , there may be many causally disconnected de sitter universes ( de sitter bubbles )",
    ". some of their quantum states may be far from the bunch - davies vacuum and be entangled with those of the other part of the multiverse as shown in  @xcite .",
    "to model such a situation , we consider two separated de sitter spaces supposing that they are in a maximally entangled pure state initially .",
    "we then introduce two observers who determine the entanglement between the two causally disconnected de sitter spaces .",
    "we assume that one of the observers is inside of a de sitter universe ( a de sitter bubble ) and want to see how the inside observer detects the signature of entanglement with another de sitter universe ( another de sitter bubble ) .",
    "since the inside observer has no access to the region outside their universe , the observer must trace over the disconnected , inaccessible outside region and thus lose information about it .",
    "then the observer s state is going to be a mixed state . on the other hand , the other observer remains in a pure state of the other separated de sitter space , so we need to consider the entanglement between the mixed and pure states .",
    "the entanglement entropy defined as the von neumann entropy is a measure of entanglement for a biparticle pure state . for any mixed state of an arbitrary biparticle system ,",
    "negativity or logarithmic negativity is known as a measure of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this measure would be useful for analyzing the entanglement between two observers of causally disconnected de sitter universes .    in this paper ,",
    "firstly , we calculate the negativity of quantum entanglement of a massive scalar field in a de sitter background . more precisely , we compute the negativity for two causally disconnected open chart in de sitter space and check the consistency of qualitative feature obtained by calculating the entanglement entropy in @xcite .",
    "next , we try to extend the quantum system by introducing two de sitter spaces , with a hope to extract more information about quantum entanglement of the multiverse .",
    "we calculate the negativity of a quantum state with an initially maximally entangled state .",
    "we will see the entanglement becomes more or less entangled on large scales depending on the scalar mass and recovers the initial entangled state in the small scale limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we review the necessary definitions of negativity and logarithmic negativity with some simple examples . in section [ s3 ] , we review the method developed in  @xcite with some comments relevant to the calculation of the negativity . we then calculate the logarithmic negativity for two causally disconnected regions . in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "we introduce two observers who determine the entanglement between the two causally disconnected de sitter spaces , and calculate the logarithmic negativity between them .",
    "our results are summarized and their implication is discussed in section [ s5 ] .",
    "to characterize the entanglement of a quantum state , there have been many entanglement measures proposed .",
    "the negativity is one such measure of quantum entanglement , which is derived from the positive partial transpose criterion for separability  @xcite . here",
    ", we explain the definition of negativity and logarithmic negativity .",
    "we consider a quantum mechanical system consisting of subspaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hilbert space becomes a direct product @xmath10 . for a pure state",

    "therefore , the entanglement entropy is a good measure of the quantum entanglement .",
    "however , the entanglement entropy also gives a nonzero value even in the presence of classical correlations that have the state mixed .",
    "in such a case , the entanglement entropy does not distinguish quantum correlations from classical ones  @xcite .    as a powerful measure in such cases , negativity and logarithmic negativity based on a criterion for separability is known .",
    "the idea is to characterize an entangled state as a state that is not separable .",
    "a state is separable if and only if the density operator of the total system is expressed as a sum of tensor products of the density operator of subsystems : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a density operator of the total system .",
    "if we consider a general density operator including entangled and non - entangled states , which is expanded as @xmath23 with coefficients @xmath24 . taking a partial transpose with respect to the subsystem @xmath8 , we obtain a new operator @xmath25 on the other hand , for non - entangled state eq .",
    "( [ nonentangled ] ) , its partial transpose is unchanged @xmath26 thus , we find @xmath27 ( ie",
    ". all eigenvalues are positive ) for the non - entangled state . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath28 has a negative eigenvalue , the density operator @xmath22 can not be written as eq .",
    "( [ nonentangled ] ) and the state is guaranteed to be entangled .",
    "thus , we come to the following definition of an entanglement measure called negativity . the negativity is defined by summing over all the negative eigenvalues @xmath29 thus , it would seem that when @xmath30 , there exists no entanglement .",
    "however , unfortunately , this measure is not additive and not suitable for multi - subsystems .",
    "hence , we need to define another entanglement measure named the logarithmic negativity as an improvement on the entanglement negativity . to this end , we introduce the trace norm of @xmath28 : @xmath31 where the trace norm is defined by @xmath32 of the operator @xmath33 .",
    "we find it written in terms of the negativity as @xmath34 due to the conservation of probability @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and thus @xmath37 .",
    "then the negativity can written as @xmath38 the logarithmic negativity is then defined as @xmath39 when @xmath40 , the state is entangled .",
    "let us illustrate how to compute the negativity for a pure state .",
    "we can use the schmidt decomposition for a pure state @xmath41 then the partial transpose of the density matrix @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 if we introduce @xmath44 is orthogonal to @xmath45 .",

    ", we shall apply this measure to quantify the entanglement of a quantum state in de sitter space .",

    "now , we sum over all the negative eigenvalues and calculate the logarithmic negativity defined in eq .",
    "( [ lnvsn ] ) .",
    "since we focus on an observer s detector for modes of momentum @xmath172 , we do nt integrate either over @xmath172 nor a volume integral over the hyperboloid .",
    "the result is found in figure  [ fig5 ] where we take @xmath243 .",
    "the qualitative feature of it is similar to figure  [ fig2 ] . in both cases of entanglement between two causally disconnected open charts in a de sitter space and",
    "two causally separated de sitter spaces , two peaks appear , one for the conformally invariant case ( @xmath76 ) and one for the massless case ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these had in fact appeared in the negative eigenvalues at small @xmath172 in the left panel of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "thus , if we take @xmath244 , the logarithmic negativity becomes similar to the blue line in the left panel of figure  [ fig4 ] and the state is no longer entangled in a region centered at @xmath245 as seen in figure  [ fig4 - 2 ] .",
    "this would reflect the property of de sitter expansion analogous to the case of the high acceleration limit of an accelerated observer in minkowski space  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have studied the entanglement negativity of a free massive scalar field between two causally disconnected regions of the multiverse .",
    "firstly , we calculated the negativity between two causally disconnected open charts in de sitter space .",
    "since the inside of a nucleated bubble is known to look like an open universe , this setup corresponds to studying the entanglement between inside and outside of a simplified bubble without a bubble wall .",
    "we found that the qualitative feature of it agrees with the one calculated by entanglement entropy in  @xcite , that is , the entanglement as a function of mass parameter squared has two peaks when the scalar field is conformally invariant and massless , and for large mass the entanglement decays exponentially .",
    "the oscillating behavior for small mass should be related to the balance between the mass of the scalar field and de sitter expansion , but this remains an open question .",
    "we then introduced two observers who determine the entanglement between two causally separated de sitter spaces , supposing that they are initially in a maximally entangled pure state in the structure of the multiverse .",
    "we set one of the observers to remain inside of a simplified bubble , that is , remaining constrained to the region @xmath59 of the open chart in a de sitter space and set the other observer to be the other de sitter space .",
    "we computed the negativity in this setup and found that the scale dependence enters into the entanglement when the hilbert space of the inside observer was divided into two subspaces of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "we showed that the initially maximally entangled state becomes more or less entangled on large scales depending on the mass of the scalar field and recovers the initially entangled state in the small scale limit .",
    "mathematically , the increase of entanglement is because the infinite degrees of freedom of the state come in the inside the observer s state by confining to one of the regions of the open chart .",
    "so we found that the increase of entanglement is due to the observer s point of view and that the quantum entanglement is observer dependent .",
    "the reason for the decrease in entanglement would be similar to the case of an accelerated observer in minkowski space as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this reflects that the entanglement is an observer dependent quantity as well .",
    "we also showed that the entanglement remains on large scales when the scalar field is close to the cases of masslessness or conformal invariance .",
    "this result is consistent with the one obtained in  @xcite where the entanglement affects the shape of the spectrum on large scales comparable to or greater than the curvature scale of the open universe when the scalar mass is @xmath223 .",
    "we then calculated the logarithmic negativity and showed that the result , as a function of mass parameter for a fixed mode around @xmath222 , is similar to the entanglement between two causally separated open charts in de sitter space . on larger scales",
    "@xmath244 , the entanglement vanishes in a region centered at @xmath218 .",
    "we speculated that this reflects the property of the de sitter expansion analogous to the case of the high acceleration limit of an observer in minkowski space , but this remains another open question .",
    "we note that the negativity does not vanish even in the small scale limit ( @xmath231 )",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the effect of entanglement on small scales can be observed .",
    "indeed , it might appear in the initial state as a non - bunch davies vacuum  @xcite .",
    "we also discussed the cases of the conformally invariant and massless scalar , which turned out to have a thermal property .",
    "this is because the density matrix becomes a thermal state with temperature @xmath247 .",
    "this reminds us of the phenomenon of a consequence of the unruh effect by an accelerated observer , and confirms that the entanglement is an observer dependent quantity in de sitter space as well . in the study of  @xcite ,",
    "the difference in the spectra of vacuum fluctuations between the originally entangled state and the mixed state after tracing out the inaccessible region ( the difference between blue and red lines ) disappeared in these cases .",
    "so these cases might relate to some peculiar property of de sitter space",
    ". it would be interesting to examine those cases in more details .",
    "it would also be interesting to make use of the entanglement of primordial gravitational waves to find observational signatures in the multiverse , as we found that massless scalar field tends to increase the entanglement on large scales .",
    "also gravitational waves are less interactive and the entanglement of them could carry the information of the multiverse without possible contaminations .    from the above arguments",
    ", we expect that quantum entanglement would be able to provide some evidence for the existence of the multiverse .",
    "we would like to thank yasusada nambu for fruitful discussions .",
