    "chiral perturbation theory  @xcite ( chpt ) is the effective theory describing the low - energy expansion of qcd green functions .",
    "it is a fundamental tool in low - energy hadron phenomenology .",
    "state - of - the - art calculations involve expansions to nnlo ( @xmath18 ) in external momenta and quark masses  @xcite .",
    "given the large number of low - energy constants ( lecs ) appearing in the chpt effective lagrangian to order @xmath18",
    "@xcite , in order to retain predictive power it is highly desirable to develop a non - perturbative framework to match the effective low - energy description to qcd and to estimate the lecs . in this work",
    "we use the @xmath0 expansion framework together with the minimal hadronic ansatz  @xcite to study the matching between low and high energies for the @xmath1 three - point function of one scalar and two pseudoscalar densities in the chiral limit .",
    "the purpose of our investigation is twofold .",
    "first , we wish to extend the @xmath0-motivated matching scheme that has proved successful in other cases  @xcite to the @xmath1 three - point function .",
    "the scheme entails the construction of a hadronic interpolation between the known low- and high - momentum regimes , dictated respectively by chiral symmetry and by the qcd asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the approximations involve the choice of the hadronic content and the corresponding set of short - distance constraints to be satisfied .",
    "we truncate the spectrum to the lowest - lying resonance multiplet per channel , based on the observation that the low - lying hadronic spectrum has the largest impact on the lecs .",
    "this choice defines our hadronic ansatz as the most general meromorphic function with poles corresponding to goldstone bosons and @xmath19 , @xmath20 resonances .",
    "concerning the short - distance behaviour , the leading power in the ope for the @xmath1 green function displays anomalous scaling , making the explicit matching with a meromorphic function problematic . in our analysis",
    "we therefore impose that the behaviour of our ansatz at large momenta is not worse than the one required by qcd .",
    "these constraints are then fully compatible with the asymptotic vanishing of those hadronic form factors that we need to consider for fixing the relevant lecs",
    ".    beyond the general aspects mentioned above , the @xmath1 green function is of special phenomenological interest , as its low - energy behaviour allows to determine the lecs governing su(3 ) breaking in @xmath4 decays to @xmath2 . in turn",
    ", @xmath4 decays offer the possibility of a precise determination of the ckm mixing parameter @xmath7 , and thus an accurate test of ckm unitarity when combined with knowledge of @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to explore the quantitative implications of our matching framework for @xmath4 decays and to assess the attendant uncertainty .",
    "the material in this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spp ] we describe in detail the matching procedure for the @xmath22 correlator .",

    "in fact , the anomalous dimensions of the ( pseudo)scalar currents and of the quark condensate imply nontrivial wilson coefficients in ( [ spp - ope ] ) that ensure the correct scale dependence and modify the asymptotic behaviour by logarithms .",
    "we come back to this important point in subsection [ subsec : sd ] .    in the case where only two of the three coordinates @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 approach each other",
    ", the analysis reduces to the ope of pairs of quark currents and yields in momentum space .",

    "we thus deduce @xmath53 when @xmath54 , not conflicting with ( [ sd : q fix ] ) .",

    "we have constructed a meromorphic approximation to the @xmath1 green function with pole singularities corresponding to goldstone modes and lowest - lying scalar ( @xmath19 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath20 ) resonances .",
    "the highlights of our analysis are :    * we have shown how the polynomial terms in our ansatz can be fixed by imposing the correct large - momentum behaviour implied by qcd both off - shell ( ope constraints ) and on the relevant hadron mass shells ( form factor constraints ) .",
    "because of nontrivial wilson coefficients , one can not match the ope constraints exactly with a finite number of resonance poles .",
    "we have instead required a large - momentum behaviour for our ansatz that is not worse than predicted by qcd . for the particle content used , no inconsistencies arise with this set of constraints . *",
    "this matching procedure has allowed us to determine three of the lecs of @xmath2 ( @xmath106 , @xmath114 , @xmath104 ) appearing in the low - energy expansion of @xmath1 in terms of resonance masses @xmath214 and @xmath143 .",
    "in particular , @xmath106 is uniquely determined by requiring the correct behaviour of the pion scalar form factor @xmath215 , while @xmath114 is fixed by the correct scaling of the one - pion form factors @xmath112 and @xmath178 .",
    "* we have estimated the uncertainty of the large-@xmath59 matching procedure by varying the chiral renormalization scale at which the matching is performed . while being a subleading effect in the @xmath0 counting , the scale ambiguity @xmath188 gev gives rise to sizable uncertainties .",
    "for the same reason , loop contributions must be included in phenomenological applications .",
    "* we have explored the impact of our results on the estimate of the local @xmath18 contribution to @xmath3 breaking in @xmath4 decays .",
    "we find that the resulting effect is much smaller than the ratio of mass scales @xmath216 would suggest , due to interfering contributions .",
    "when combined with known loop corrections @xcite , our estimate leads to @xmath217 , the mean value being opposite in sign to most other existing calculations . using this input and the most recent experimental results for the @xmath194 branching ratio  @xcite and lifetime for @xmath193  @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath218 .",
    "the mean value of our result is smaller than the value inferred from ckm unitarity @xmath219 , using the most recent determination of @xmath21 @xcite . if the recent precision measurement of the neutron lifetime @xcite were confirmed our preferred value for @xmath7 would however be in perfect agreement with ckm unitarity .",
    "* we have considered variations of the hadronic ansatz to investigate the stability of our results .",
    "the smallness of the tree - level part compared to the loop contribution of @xmath2 for @xmath220 appears as generic feature of a few - resonance approximation for the set of large - momentum constraints considered . in view of the significant implications for the determination of @xmath7 , the validity of our approach",
    "will be further investigated also for other green functions . *",
    "finally , we have also used our results to estimate the deviation from the callan  treiman relation and to calculate the slope of the scalar @xmath4 form factor .    * acknowledgements * + v.c .",
