    "implements a coadjoint orbit reduction is through a momentum map , and this holds even for the case of singular orbits ( again ignoring functional analytic details ) .",
    "thus , in summary , _ the reduction is the epdiff analog of the reduction in fluid mechanics ( that is , the equations ) to point ( or blob ) vortex dynamics , vortex filaments , or sheets . _",
    "there are , however , some important differences between vortex dynamics for incompressible flows and the dynamics of the measure valued epdiff solutions . for example , the lagrangian representations of the equations of motion show that epdiff solutions have inertia , while the corresponding solutions for point ( or blob ) vortices of the epdiff@xmath112 dynamics have no inertia .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of measure - valued solutions of what we call the epdiff equations , standing for the _ euler - poincar equations associated with the diffeomorphism group ( of @xmath0 or an @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath2)_. our main focus will be on the case of quadratic lagrangians ; that is , on geodesic motion on the diffeomorphism group with respect to the right invariant sobolev @xmath3 metric . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding euler - poincar ( ep ) equations are the epdiff equations , which coincide with the averaged template matching equations ( atme ) from computer vision and agree with the camassa - holm ( ch ) equations in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding equations for the volume preserving diffeomorphism group are the well - known lae ( lagrangian averaged euler ) equations for incompressible fluids .    we first show that the epdiff equations are generated by a smooth vector field on the diffeomorphism group for sufficiently smooth solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to known results for incompressible fluids  both the euler equations and the lae equations  and it shows that for sufficiently smooth solutions , the equations are well - posed for short time . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , numerical evidence suggests that , as time progresses , these smooth solutions break up into singular solutions which , at least in one dimension , exhibit soliton behavior .    with regard to these non - smooth solutions , we study measure - valued solutions that generalize to higher dimensions the peakon solutions of the ( ch ) equation in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main purposes of this paper is to show that many of the properties of these measure - valued solutions may be understood through the fact that their solution ansatz is a momentum map . </S>",
    "<S> some additional geometry is also pointed out , for example , that this momentum map is one leg of a natural dual pair . </S>"
