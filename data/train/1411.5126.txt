    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) \" @xcite and are distinct from their low luminosity cousins .",
    "determining the heating sources for slsne and clarifying the explosion mechanisms of their progenitors would be of outstanding importance for the theory of supernovae and of stellar evolution . while observational studies of both light curves and spectra of slsne have been largely pursued in the last decade ( see * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is still not completely clear how slsne with a variety of characters in their light curves and spectra are powered .",

    "] other challenges posed on the @xmath1ni cascade decay model are that more massive @xmath1ni needs more massive ejecta resulting in broad theoretical light curves and that the @xmath1co decay tails have rather shallow decline rate , both of which are not always consistent with observations @xcite .",

    "@xcite have applied their semi - analytical model @xcite to the observed light curves of a dozen slsne and suggested that both hydrogen - deficient ( type i ) slsne and hydrogen - rich ( type ii ) slsne can be powered by ejecta - csm interactions .    the rotational energy of a rapidly rotating , strongly magnetized pulsar forming after the core collapse of a massive star could significantly affect the evolution and emission of an outflow surrounding the star .",

    "* ) that the rotational energy of a nascent magnetar can be injected into the relativistic outflow of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) by magnetic dipole radiation and could lead to the shallow decay of a grb afterglow , which is very consistent with observations by the @xmath11 satellite @xcite .",
    "the magnetar - powered scenario has also been introduced to explain the light curves of some sne or slsne .",
    "@xcite suggested that a magnetar with surface magnetic field @xmath12 g and initial spin period @xmath1310  ms can explain the second peak and late - time decline rate of the light curve of sn  2005bf ; @xcite and @xcite calculated the theoretical light curves powered by millisecond magnetars ; @xcite employed the semi - analytical magnetar - powered model to fit the light curves of six slsne ic ( ptf10hgi , sn  2011ke , ptf11rks , sn  2011kf , sn  2012il and sn",

    "hence , they concluded that the magnetar - powered model can provides a viable explanation for all of the slsne ic .",
    "the successful fit for another slsn ic , ptf12dam @xcite , with magnetar - powered model supported the conclusion raised by @xcite .",
    "this so - called  magnetar - powered model \" has attracted more and more attentions because it can explain many bright and/or sophisticated light curves of a variety of sne while the traditional radioactivity - powered model can not .",
    "recently , @xcite fitted the light curves of three slsne ic ( lsq12dlf , sss120810 , sn  2013dg ) and one slsn iin ( css121015 ) using the @xmath1ni cascade decay model , magnetar - powered model , and ejecta - csm interaction model , respectively .",
    "their results excluded the @xmath1ni cascade decay model and found that the late - time light curves reproduced by the magnetar - powered model are brighter than the observations , posing a challenge for the magnetar - powered model .",
    "hence , they suggested either that the magnetar - powered model fails to explain the light curves of those slsne , or that there exists x - ray leakage in ejecta of these slsne .",
    "they have alternatively fitted the data of these slsne using the ejecta - csm interaction model and obtained rather good agreements . comparing these results",

    "this conclusion is not only different from @xcite and @xcite who favor the magnetar - powered model but also from @xcite and @xcite who favor the interaction model .",
    "therefore , the energy generation mechanisms responsible for slsne ic are still under debate .",
    "our major goals in this paper are to check the possibility that the magnetar - powered model can be responsible for some slsne ic or iin and to confirm quantitatively the leakage effect in the expanding ejecta . for these purposes ,",
    "we try to incorporate the leakage effect into the original magnetar - powered model , supposing that there exists gamma ray and x - ray leakage in sne ejecta after energy was injected to the ejecta .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first derive the semi - analytical equation of sn light curves powered by magnetars in this section and revise it by introducing the leakage effect .    using equations ( 30)-(33 ) , ( 36 ) ,",
    "( 47 - 48 ) derived by @xcite and neglecting the @xmath14 term ( where @xmath15 is the diffusion timescale , @xmath16 is the initial total thermal energy and proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19  cm is the initial radius of the progenitor , @xmath20 is the initial temperature of the center of the ejecta ) , we get the photospheric luminosity of sne powered by a variety of energy sources ( radioactive @xmath1ni decay , magnetar spinning - down , etc ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective light curve timescale , @xmath23 is the power function of the generalised power source . using equation ( 10 ) in @xcite , @xmath22 can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the thomson electron scattering opacity , the ejecta mass , the expansion velocity of the ejecta and the speed of light in a vacuum , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is a constant that accounts for the density distribution of the ejecta .",
    "although the rotational energy dissipation mechanism of the magnetars is ambiguous , we can expect that most of the rotational energy released is likely to be poynting - flux - dominated wind @xcite .",
    "when the high energy leptons and/or baryons in the magnetar wind hit the sn ejecta , x - ray and gamma ray photons can be generated and propagate in the ejecta .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that most of the spin - down energy can be converted to x - ray and gamma ray photons .    in the magnetar - powered model , adopting the _ ansatz _ that all the spin - down energy released can be converted to the heating energy of surrounding sn ejecta , the input power for the ejecta is equal to the magnetic dipole radiation power , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the rotational energy of a magnetar , @xmath32 is the moment of inertia of a magnetar whose canonical value can be set to @xmath33  g  @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the spin - down timescale of the magnetar @xcite , in which the magnetar dissipates most of its rotational energy into the expanding ejecta .",
    "here @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass , rotational period and radius of the magnetar , respectively .",
    "the parameters have been scaled to typical values @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "most of previous researches that fit observed data with the magnetar - powered model neglected hard ( gamma ray and x - ray ) photon leakage at all epochs , whereas in reality a portion of hard photons can escape from the ejecta while other photons can be down - comptonized to uv - optical - ir photons and diffuse to the photosphere , especially after the transition from the photospheric phase to the nebular phase .",
    "observations for sn  1987a @xcite and sn  2014j @xcite have revealed that a large amount of gamma rays and x - rays escape from their ejecta at later times .",
    "recently , @xcite have explored the effect of mildly magnetized millisecond pulsars ( @xmath42  g ) on sn remnants and demonstrated that the hard emissions could generate bright ( @xmath43 erg  s@xmath44 ) tev gamma ray emissions and a milder x - ray peak ( @xmath45 erg  s@xmath44 ) could appear several hundred days after the core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion .",
    "discussions of the details of the gamma ray and x - ray emission leakage are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we then introduce the leakage factor @xmath46 and the trapping factor @xmath47 in the magnetar - powered model to represent gamma / x - ray leakage and trapping rate , where @xmath48 is a dimensionless parameter . to fit the late - time light curve of sn  1987a , while @xcite and @xcite adopted @xmath49 to fit the late - time light curve of sn  1998bw .",
    "] @xmath50 is the optical depth of the ejecta to gamma rays and can be written as @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "@xmath61 where @xmath62  cm  s@xmath44 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65  g@xmath44 , @xmath66 is the effective gamma ray opacity .",
    "the typical value of @xmath58 for normal core collapse sne ( ccsne ) is between @xmath67  s@xmath68 and @xmath69  s@xmath68 .    using equations ( [ equ : lum ] ) , ( [ equ : input - mag ] ) , ( [ equ : leakage ] ) and let @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the photospheric luminosity function in the magnetar - powered model with leakage can be written as @xmath72    we refer to the model corresponding to equation ( [ equ : l - mag ] ) as the  revised magnetar - powered model \" . when @xmath73 , the leakage can be neglected and the model can be called as the  original magnetar - powered model \" .    therefore , the free parameters of our model are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( which determine @xmath22 ; equation ( [ equ : tau_m ] ) ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( which determine @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , and @xmath58 .",
    "the velocity @xmath27 , if measured , can be fixed at its measured value and can not be regarded as a free parameter .",
    "if we assume @xmath53 , @xmath58 can be calculated from @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath66 using equation ( [ equ : leakage ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as has been shown by @xcite , for gamma rays @xmath78 . however , as the density profile and @xmath66 are quite uncertain , can vary between approximately 0 and 14 @xcite , @xmath66 can vary between approximately 0.01 and 0.2 @xmath65  g@xmath44 while the effective x - ray opacity @xmath79 can vary between approximately 0.2 and @xmath80 @xmath65  g@xmath44 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "in this section , we try to fit the observed data of sn  2010gx , css121015 , sn  2013dg , lsq12dlf and sss120810 using our revised magnetar - powered model .",
    "our fits follow the researches performed by @xcite and @xcite whose fit parameters for these slsne are listed in table [ parameters ] and are all denoted as  model a \" .",
    "the common feature of the theoretical light curves reproduced by  model a \" is that the early - time theoretical light curves were well fitted ( except for lsq12dlf ) while the late - time theoretical light curves are brighter than the observed luminosities .",
    "i.e. , the original magnetar - powered model fails to fit their late - time light curves .",
    "an excess in the theoretical light curve reproduced for sn  2013dg is not obvious , but may still exist ( see a discussion in section [ subsec : sn2013dg ] ) .",
    "we now employ our revised magnetar - powered model to fit the observed data and upper limits of aforementioned slsne and explore whether the late - time excess can be eliminated or decreased .",
    "based on the same parameters as @xcite and @xcite ( except for sn  2013dg and lsq12dlf ) , we incorporated the leakage effect into the model , i.e. , the values of @xmath58 are not set to be infinity , according to equation ( [ equ : leakage ] ) , we calculate the values of @xmath58 for these five slsne , see table [ parameters ] .",
    "the light curves reproduced both by the original and revised models were shown in figures [ fig1 ] - [ fig5 ] .",
    "@xcite have fitted the early - time ( @xmath83  days ) data of sn  2010gx using the @xmath1ni- , magnetar- and interaction - powered models and have excluded the @xmath1ni - powered model as @xmath1ni mass needed ( 12.97 @xmath84 ) is larger than the ejecta mass ( 5.17 @xmath84 ) , see their table 3 .",
    "@xcite fitted the early- and late - time data using the original magnetar - powered model .",
    "their fit have late - time excess in the theoretical light curve .",
    "therefore , we try to fit the light curve using our revised magnetar - powered model . if @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the value of @xmath58 for sn  2010gx is @xmath87  s@xmath68 .",
    "our fit for sn  2010gx shows that our revised model can eliminates the late - time excess in the theoretical light curve reproduced by the original magnetar - powered model and well fits the whole light curve of sn  2010gx , see figure [ fig1 ] , indicating that our magnetar - powered model can be responsible to sn  2010gx and that the leakage is unavoidable in the expanding ejecta , although we can not verify the precise amount of leakage due to the lack of later time data .",
    "css121015 is a unique type iin slsn in our sample here and can be well explained by the csm interaction model @xcite . if the leakage was neglected ( @xmath88 ) , the late - time light curve reproduced by the magnetar - powered model is brighter than observations .",
    "here we fit the light curve using our revised magnetar - powered model . if @xmath85 and @xmath89 , the value of @xmath58 for css121015 is @xmath90  s@xmath68 .",
    "the light curve reproduced by another set of parameters ( see model b for css121015 in table [ parameters ] ) shows that the late - time excess in the magnetar - powered model can also be canceled by introducing the leakage effect , see figure [ fig2 ] .      for sn  2013dg",
    ", since the size of the host galaxy contribution to the photometry at @xmath91  d is unknown @xcite , the sn may be fainter than the data .",
    "if the flux of sn  2013dg far exceeds the flux of the host at @xmath91  days , the later can be neglected and the fit is good enough .",
    "however , if the flux of the host is comparable to the flux of sn  2013dg , the values of the last two data should be reduced by approximately 50% .",
    "so the late - time excess may still exist in the original magnetar - powered model .",
    "@xcite did not fit the two uncertain data points with their csm model .",
    "although the luminosities of the last two data must be fainter than the real luminosities , it is unreasonable to exclude them from analysis .",
    "so the csm - interaction model can not solely account for the late - time light curve of sn  2013dg .",
    "in order to fit the last two data , substantial @xmath1ni is required and the parameters must be significantly changed .    considering the difficulties mentioned above",
    ", we attempt to employ our revised magnetar - powered model to fit the light curve of sn  2013dg .",
    "we first calculate the  canonical \" value @xmath92  s@xmath68 ( corresponding the case of @xmath85 and @xmath89 ) using model b and find that the late - time theoretical luminosities are dimmer than the data without subtracting the contribution from the host galaxy . if we regard the luminosities at @xmath91  days as precise ones , i.e. , the contribution from the host is neglected , we find that when @xmath93  s@xmath68 ( then @xmath82 ) the reproduced light curve can get a better match for the last two data than the original magnetar - powered model .",
    "as @xmath58 is a free parameter when @xmath94 and/or @xmath82 , the late - time light curve can vary continually from one situation to another , so we always can choose a reasonable value of @xmath58 to fit the real tail of sn  2013dg as long as the values with subtracting the host contributions are in a reasonable range .",
    "the light curves reproduced by other sets of parameters ( see models b and c for sn  2013dg in table [ parameters ] ) are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the advantage of our revised magnetar - powered model for explaining the sn  2013dg is that it can simultaneously explain both the early- and late - time data / upper limits without introducing any amount of @xmath1ni which is needed for the csm - interaction model , while the original magnetar - powered model can only fits the sn - dominated data and the csm - interaction model has to discard the last two data .",
    "two problems exist in the fit for lsq12dlf performed by @xcite using the magnetar - powered model : the earlier luminosities reproduced far exceed the observed upper limit and the late - time luminosity is also brighter than the last observed datum , see figure 9 in @xcite and  model a \" light curve in our figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we adjust both the parameters of the magnetar and the explosion time and hence avoid the confliction in the early epoch and reduce the late - phase excess .",
    "the new light curve (  model b \" light curve ) is narrower than the light curve reproduced by the original magnetar - powered model .    in order to eliminate the late - time excess in the theoretical light curve , we take into account the leakage effect .",
    "if @xmath85 and @xmath86 , due to the large ejecta mass and low expansion velocity , the value of @xmath58 for lsq12dlf is rather large , @xmath95  s@xmath68 , resulting in a minor discrepancy between the  model c \" light curve and  model b \" light curve , so the leakage can not effectively reduce the late time excess .",
    "if @xmath94 and/or @xmath82 , we take the value of @xmath58 to be @xmath96  s@xmath68 (  model d \" ) , then the late - time excess can be completely eliminated .",
    "two main difficulties in the fits for sss120810 are the rebrightening (  bump \" ) in the late - time ( @xmath97 100 days after the explosion ) light curve and the late - time excess .",
    "we first deal only with the latter .",
    "if @xmath98  @xmath65 g@xmath44 , we calculate the value of @xmath58 to be @xmath99  s@xmath68 (  model b \" ) and obtain a light curve in which the excess can be partly canceled .    if @xmath94 and/or @xmath82 , we take the value of @xmath58 to be @xmath100  s@xmath68 (  model c \" ) , then the late - time excess is further eliminated but does not vanish completely and the early - time light curve begin to deviate slightly from the observations .    although the later phase excess of light curve reproduced by the revised magnetar - powered model for sss120810 can not be completely eliminated by late - time leakage , the problem of excess was alleviated and the discrepancies between the data and the theoretical values are in a reasonable range , see figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the rebrightening of sss120810 can not be explained by any model solely .",
    "@xcite proposed that the energy resulting in the rebrightening might come from interactions between multiple csm shells or breakout of a magnetar ionization front @xcite .",
    "we also suggest that the light curve of sss120810 can be decomposed into two components .",
    "in addition to the magnetar rotational energy injection which powers a monotonically declined light curve after the peak , something else , e.g. , the thermal energy deposited by the shock wave in the oxygen shell @xcite , may contribute to the formation of the bump and compensate the deviation in our  model c \" light curve during @xmath101 days after the explosion .",
    "detailed analysis and modeling for the bump are beyond the scope of this paper and we no longer discuss them here .",
    "in the past five years , many authors have demonstrated that many slsne ic and ii / iin can not be powered by radioactivity solely .",
    "alternatively , light curves reproduced by the magnetar spin - down model and the ejecta - csm interaction model can both well mimic the observed data of these slsne , indicating that most slsne might be powered by newly born magnetars or ejecta - csm interactions .",
    "@xcite argued that almost all slsne can be powered by ejecta - csm interactions .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have already demonstrated that css121015 , lsq12dlf , sss120810 and sn  2013dg , which are difficult to be explained by the original magnetar - powered model due to their late - time excess in the theoretical light curves , can be explained by the ejecta - csm interaction model , giving us a hint that some slsne ic might be powered by hydrogen- and helium - poor csm interactions .    however , no spectrum of a slsn ic so far has shown narrow emission lines indicative of the interaction of the ejecta with the csm .",
    "this fact seems to suggest that the ejecta - csm interaction model is difficult to be responsible for slsne ic , ni/@xmath1co but has a signature of interactions , indicating that it is a sn ic powered by csm - interaction and there might exist slsne ic which can be explained by the csm - interaction model as this model predicts a wide range of peak luminosities . ]",
    "although @xcite argued that the absence of this character does not necessarily imply that the csm interaction model is invalid for slsne ic .",
    "besides the observational constraint aforementioned , the difficulties encountered by the interaction model for slsne ic must also be discussed from theoretical perspectives .",
    "the first difficulty is that the formation mechanisms of massive ( @xmath102 ) h- and he - poor csm are ambiguous .",
    "one of the main mechanisms explaining unusual high mass loss rate is the so - called  pulsational pair - instability ( ppi ) \" @xcite , which involves a very massive ( @xmath103@xmath84 ) star that can experience a series of eruptions caused by @xmath104 pair generation and consequent @xmath105 pair creation but the star can not be destroyed completely until it explodes as a genuine ccsn .",
    "the progenitors of sne / slsne ic are linked to the stars without h and he envelopes which are so compact that their outer materials are difficult to be ejected by ppi or other possible mechanisms .",
    "combining the fact that no slsne presented emission lines , we argued that the csm interaction model is difficult to account for at least some of slsne ic .",
    "another assumption adopted in the csm interaction model employed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is that the photospheres of slsne is stationary , whereas in reality the photospheres must expand due to the law of conservation of momentum .",
    "the magnetar - powered model does not encounter the difficulties mentioned above . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that magnetars with surface magnetic fields @xmath106  g may constitute 10% of nascent neutron stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore , @xcite believed that the birth of rapidly rotating magnetars (  millisecond magnetars \" ) is commonplace .",
    "ms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "millisecond pulsars observed to date are all old , recycling ( i.e. spun - up ) pulsars rather than nascent ones .",
    "further observations and theoretical analysis are needed to clarify this issue . ] furthermore , the stationary photosphere assumption is not adopted in the magnetar - powered model .",
    "successful fits to the observed light curves of ptf10hgi , sn  2011kf , sn  2012il and ptf12dam using the magnetar - powered model @xcite have confirmed the validity of the original magnetar - powered model in explaining the luminosity evolution of the slsne ic .    yet the original magnetar - powered model is not a complete model since it neglects the hard emission leakage . in reality , although the ejecta of sne are opaque for gamma - ray and x - ray photon released from the magnetars at early times and these hard emission leakage are not significant , when the fast - expanding ejecta becomes more and more transparent for radiation at advanced epochs the hard photons would be pretty easy to escape from the ejecta and can not be neglected .",
    "so it is not surprising that the main problem encountered by the original magnetar - powered model is the late - time excess in the theoretical light curves of some slsne ( e.g. , sn  2010gx @xcite , css121015 , lsq12dlf , sss120810 and sn  2013dg @xcite ) .",
    "this significant challenge confronted by the original magnetar - powered model motivates us to explore possible revisions for the original magnetar - powered model .",
    "we therefore consider the leakage effect and find that the late - time light curves derived from our revised magnetar - powered model are in good agreement with observed data and upper limits , indicating not only that the magnetars can be responsible to some slsne but also that the gamma - ray and x - ray leakage are inevitable when these photons were down - comptonized to uv - optical - nir photons and diffuse out of the ejecta .",
    "accordingly , we argue that it is not necessary to apply the ejecta - csm interaction model in explaining the observed light curves for some slsne ic ( e.g. , sn  2010gx , sss120810 , lsq12dlf and sn  2013dg ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that slsn iin css121015 which can be explained by ejecta - csm interaction also can be powered by our revised magnetar - powered model , indicating that h - rich slsne powered by magnetars may exist in the universe .",
    "hence we can expect that most slsne ic can be powered by nascent millisecond magnetars and a ( minor ) portion of slsne ii can be powered by nascent millisecond magnetars or in rare cases by recycling millisecond magnetars @xcite .",
    "the fact that the late - time excess can be eliminated or decreased by hard emission leakage indicates that it is non - trivial to introduce the leakage factor in the magnetar - powered model .",
    "the values of @xmath58 adopted in our sample are @xmath107  s@xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109  s @xmath110  days , the light curves reproduced by the magnetar - powered models with and without leakage can be easily distinguished from each other , see figures [ fig1 ] - [ fig5 ] . for the same reason , the leakage effect does not significantly influence the early - time ( @xmath111  days ) light curves of these slsne .",
    "when we take the limit @xmath73 , the leakage in the ejecta can be neglected , i.e. , all gamma ray and x - ray photons should be trapped and thermalized to uv - optical - nir photons .",
    "the limit @xmath73 might be a good approximation for some other slsne - ic , e.g. , ptf10hgi , sn  2011kf , and sn  2012il , but we have no idea whether ptf11rks needs to be explained by the revised magnetar - powered model , due to the lacking of the later time ( @xmath112  days post explosion ) data and strict upper limits , see figure 12 in @xcite . the possibility that the late - time leakage can be compensated by @xmath1co decay tails can not be excluded and it might be worthwhile to verify this possibility in future modelings .",
    "another possibility accounts for full",
    "trapping is that the gamma ray and x - ray photons are so soft that @xmath66 ( @xmath113 ) is very large and the values of @xmath58 far exceed @xmath69  s@xmath68 .",
    "whether the leakage of hard emissions can plays a key role in later phases is of great interest and of great importance in future studies . a larger sample of slsne with high quality observed data , especially recorded after the slsne transitioned to the nebular phases ( @xmath114  days after the explosions ) , is required to determine the precise values of fading rate at nebular phases and therefore precise values of the parameter @xmath58 in equation ( [ equ : l - mag ] ) .    finally ,",
    "as addressed by @xcite , theoretical light curves of slsne alone are inadequate to unveil the nature of slsne . to completely clarify the energy generating mechanisms , both theoretical light curves and spectra for every individual event",
    "are needed to be examined carefully .",
    "further detailed modelings are also needed to determine precisely the parameters of putative nascent magnetars .",
