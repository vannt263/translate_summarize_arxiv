    "buckling is a common mode of mechanical failure @xcite , and its prevention is key to any successful engineering design . as early as 1759",
    ", euler @xcite gave an elegant description of the buckling of a simple beam , from which the so - called euler buckling limit was derived .",
    "works which cite the goal of obtaining structures of least weight stable against buckling can be found throughout the literature @xcite , and much understanding has been gained on optimal structural design @xcite .",
    "designs of ever increasing complexity have been analysed and recent work suggested that the optimal design of non - axisymmetric columns may involve fractal geometries @xcite . with the development of powerful computers , more and more complicated structures can be designed with optimised mechanical efficiency",
    ". however , understanding and preventing buckling remains as relevant as ever .    in this paper , we consider a simple uniform elastic beam , freely hinged at its ends and subjected to a compressive force and therefore vulnerable to buckling .",
    "however , in contrast to euler s original problem , we specify that the beam is stabilized by restoring forces , perpendicular to its length , which are provided by an elastic foundation ( as illustrated in figure [ beam1 ] ) .",
    "this represents a simple and practical method of protecting against buckling instabilities .    in the simplest case figure",
    "[ springs ] , we can imagine this elastic foundation as a finite collection of linear springs at points along the beam .",
    "each has a spring constant , and so provides a restoring force at this point , proportional to the lateral deflection of the beam .",
    "more generally , the elastic foundation could be distributed as a continuous function along the length of the beam , rather than being concentrated into discrete springs ( figure [ cont ] ) . in this case",
    ", there is a spring constant per unit length , which may vary along the beam .",
    "we are interested in optimising this elastic support , and so we need to specify a cost function for it .",
    "this we take to be the sum of the spring constants ( if there are a discrete collection of springs ) or the integral over the spring constant per unit length along the beam ( if the elastic foundation is continuous ) . by choosing the optimal distribution of these spring constants ,",
    "we wish to find the minimum cost of elastic support which will protect against buckling under a given compressive load ( or equivalently , the distribution of an elastic support of fixed cost which will support the maximum force ) .",
    "the optimal position of one or two deformable or infinitely stiff supports have been studied in the literature ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) , and general numerical approaches established for larger numbers of supports @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper , we consider the general case where any distribution of support is in principle permitted .",
    "a perturbation analysis shows that in the limit of weak support strength , the optimal elastic foundation is a concentrated delta - function at the centre of the beam , but when stronger supports are permitted , we show that the optimal solution has an upper bound on the proportion of the beam that remains unsupported . in this sense ,",
    "the optimum distribution becomes more uniform for higher values of support strength . to tackle the problem in more detail , we develop a transfer matrix description for the supported beam , and we find numerically that the optimal supports undergo a series of bifurcations , reminiscent of those encountered in iterated maps",
    "however , we are only able to proceed a limited distance in the parameter space and we are unable to explore for more complex behaviour ( for example , any possible signature of chaos @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain analytic expressions for the buckling load in the vicinity of the first bifurcation point and a corresponding series expansion for the optimal placement of elastic support . following this optimization",
    "we show that a mathematical analogy between the behaviour exhibited in this problem and that found in landau theory of second order phase transitions@xcite exists .",
    "however , the analogue of free energy is non - analytic , while in landau theory it is a smooth function of the order parameter and the control variable . our results , including critical exponents",
    "are confirmed by computer simulations , and should provide a basis for future analysis on higher order bifurcations .",
    "a slender beam of length @xmath0 , hinged at its ends , under a compressive force @xmath1 , is governed by the euler - bernoulli beam equation @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the young modulus of the beam , @xmath4 is the second moment of its cross sectional area about the neutral plane , @xmath5 is the lateral deflection , @xmath6 the distance along the beam and @xmath7 is the lateral force applied per unit length of beam . the beam is freely hinged at its end points and therefore the deflection satisfies @xmath8 at @xmath9 and @xmath0 .    if the lateral force is supplied by an elastic foundation , which provides a restoring force proportional to the lateral deflection , then through rescaling we introduce the following non - dimensional variables @xmath10",

    "in particular , for a given value of @xmath23 we seek the optimal function @xmath16 which maximises the minimum buckling force @xmath18 .    the simplest choice we can imagine is that @xmath24 takes the uniform value @xmath25 , so that the form of deflection is @xmath26 , for some integer @xmath27 , which represents a wavenumber .",

    "the second term represents the support provided by the elastic foundation , which provides the least support at the shortest length scales ( largest values of @xmath27 ) .",
    "the balance between these two terms means that as @xmath29 , the uniformly supported column buckles on a length scale of approximately @xmath30 and can support a load @xmath31    now , although a uniform elastic support is easy to analyse , it is clear that this is not always optimal .",
