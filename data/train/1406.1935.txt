    "an integral representation for the exterior square @xmath0-function for @xmath1 was given by jacquet and shalika in 1990 @xcite . in the mid 1990 s",
    "the first author , with piatetski - shapiro , embarked on the local analysis of the exterior square @xmath0-function via this integral representation in conjunction with their project to establish functoriality from @xmath7 to @xmath8 via the converse theorem and integral representations @xcite .",
    "the approach there was by the bernstein - zelevinsky theory of derivatives as in @xcite .",
    "this was set aside and never published , other than @xcite .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in the local and global theory of the exterior square @xmath0-function via this integral representation @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the second author used his results on the connection between linear periods @xcite and shalika periods to analyze the local exterior square @xmath0-functions via bernstein - zelevinsky derivatives and prove the local functional equation in the case of @xmath9 .",
    "this approach seems simpler than the approach used in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we complete the work in @xcite and derive the local functional equation for the exterior square @xmath0-function for @xmath10 . in their original paper ,",
    "jacquet and shalika considered the odd case only briefly in their last section , section 9 .",
    "we deduce the shape of the local functional equation from the global one in @xcite and then prove it using a purely local approach . as in @xcite , this is based on the bernstein - zelevinsky theory of derivatives and the theory of linear periods @xcite extended to the odd case .",
    "our method allows us to extend our results , and those of @xcite , to any irreducible admissible representation of @xmath1 via the use of representations of whittaker type .",
    "we should point out that our version of the global and local functional equation in the odd case is different from that given by kewat and raghunathan in @xcite ; we will address this discrepancy in the last section of the paper .",
    "the local functional equation of the exterior square @xmath0-function is now available for irreducible representations of @xmath1 , for any @xmath6 .",
    "we will use these local functional equations in the future to prove the inductivity , or multiplicativity , of the local exterior square @xmath0-function and @xmath11-factor , and then complete the local nonarchimedean theory of the exterior square @xmath0-function at the ramified places .",
    "we should point out that the exterior square @xmath0-function is available from the langlands - shahidi method @xcite and the main result of @xcite is that for discrete series representations the @xmath0-functions from the langlands - shahidi method and the integral representation of jacquet and shalika agree .",
