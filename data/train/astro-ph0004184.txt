    "the gi2t / regain interferometer@xmath8 is an optical interferometer of two 1.5 m telescopes . for this interferometer we have built an infrared beam combiner and used it to record spectrally dispersed infrared michelson interferograms of the mira star r  cas . in this paper we present the design of our new infrared beam combiner and r cas observations obtained in august 1999 .",
    "this beam combiner allows us to simultaneously record michelson fringes in about 128 different spectral channels from 2.00 to 2.18 @xmath0 m .",
    "the tilt of the spectrally dispersed fringes is a measure of the instantaneous optical path difference .",
    "the r  cas observations reported in this paper are the first nir interferometry observations with large 1.5 m telescopes .",
    "the aim of our mira star project is to resolve the stellar disk of mira stars , to reveal photospheric asymmetries and surface structures , and to study the wavelength and phase dependence of the diameter .",
    "previous speckle or long - baseline interferometry observations of mira stars were , for example , reported in refs .",
    "theoretical studies@xmath9 show that interferometric diameter measurements can considerably improve our understanding of cool stellar atmospheres .",
    "figure  1 shows the optical layout of our new nir beam combiner built at the mpi for radioastronomy .",
    "it consists of an anamorphotic lens system , an image plane slit , a grism , a shutter , a picnic detector , a data storage computer , and an array of digital signal processors for data processing .",
    "the dsps can calculate the power spectrum and the instantaneous optical path difference in real - time .",
    "the typical frame rate is 3 frames per second ( 256@xmath10256 pixels per frame ) .",
    "the first infrared observations with our new beam combiner mounted to the gi2t / regain interferometer were carried out on august 22 and 25 , 1999 .",
    "the observational parameters of the r cas and reference star observations are as follows :    figure  [ fig : interf ] shows two of several thousand recorded interferograms of r cas .",
    "the interferograms of r cas and the reference stars were flatfielded and sky - subtracted , and the visibilities of each spectral channel and baseline were derived by calculating the ensemble average power spectra .",
    "the method described by mourard et al.@xmath11 was applied to derive visibility ratios of the object and reference star observations and to obtain calibrated r  cas visibilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : vis ] shows the derived r  cas visibilities .",
    "the solid line is the visibility function of a uniform - disk of a star with 25.3 mas diameter .",
    "the dashed curve is the uniform - disk visibility fit curve which is required for our observations with large 1.5 m telescopes .",
    "this dashed visibility fit function has no zeros since an average of many baselines is measured rather than only one single baseline if the telescope pupils are large .",
    "if the projected baseline from mirror center to mirror center is for example 10 m , all baselines between 8.5 m and 11.5 m are simultaneously measured .",
    "the r cas visibilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] show that the center - to - limb variation of r cas is not a uniform - disk function .",
    "the large visibility values at spatial frequencies larger than @xmath1240 cycles per arcsec can be explained by high - contrast surface structure on the stellar surface of r  cas or by other types of unexpected center - to - limb variations .",
    "a uniform - disk fit diameter of 25.3 mas @xmath2 3.3 mas is obtained if only the first three low - frequency visibility points ( projected baselines 12.01  m , 13.80  m , and 13.88  m ) are used for the uniform - disk fit .",
    "the error bars of our first ir observations are relatively large because the weather situation was not favorable and the control system ( mourard et al .",
    ", this proceedings@xmath13 ) of the gi2t / regain ( mourard et al . , this proceedings@xmath14 ) was not fully operational",
    ". under normal observing conditions the error bars will be much smaller .",
    "in this section we derive various types of angular diameters from the measured visibilities of r  cas by applying the different theoretical center - to - limb intensity variations ( hereafter clv ) of different mira star models ( bessel , scholz , and wood 1996 = bsw96@xmath15 , hofmann , scholz and wood 1998 = hsw98@xmath16 ) . from these angular diameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ross ] ) and the bolometric flux , we derive effective temperatures ( fig .  [",
    "fig : teff ] ) .",
    "all mira star models used in this paper are from bsw96 ( d and e series ) and from hsw98 ( p , m and o series ) .",
    "they were developed as possible representations of the prototype mira variable o ceti , and hence have periods @xmath17 very close to the 332 day period of this star .",
    "they differ in pulsation mode , assumed mass @xmath18 and assumed luminosity @xmath19 .",
    "the bsw96 models differ from the more advanced hsw98 models with respect to the pulsation modelling technique .",
    "the five models represent stars pulsating in the fundamental mode ( @xmath20 ; d , p and m models ) or in the first - overtone mode ( @xmath21 ; e and o models ) .",

    "is given by the distance from the star s center at which the rosseland optical depth equals unity ( @xmath26=1 ) .",

    "a convenient approximation for calculating bolometric magnitudes is to use a blackbody function to interpolate between photometric observations in the j , h , k , l and m bands . for estimating the bolometric flux we used the photometric jhklm measurements of b. yudin which were carried out with the 1.25  m telescope at the crimean station of the sternberg astronomical institute in moscow seven days after our visibility observations .",
    "the derived bolometric flux of r  cas on 29 august 1999 was 980.6@xmath2180@xmath1010@xmath41erg@xmath42s@xmath43 .",

    "this @xmath49 value agrees within the 1@xmath47 error with the theoretical value ( @xmath49=0.097 ) for fundamental pulsation mode for 1m@xmath7 agb stars with a period of @xmath12430 days ( fox&wood@xmath50 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath49 value of first overtone pulsation mode is @xmath49=0.056 .",
    "note , however , that no direct measurement of a mira mass exists and that a 20% uncertainty of @xmath18 would for example result in a 10% uncertainty of @xmath49 .",
    "we have observed the mira star r  cas with the gi2t / regain interferometer and our new infrared beam combiner .",
    "a uniform - disk ( ud ) k - band ( 2.1  @xmath0 m ) diameter of 25.3mas@xmath23.3mas was derived from the interferograms obtained with baselines between 12.0 m and 13.9 m at near - maximum variability phase 0.08 .",
    "the unusually high visibility values at baselines 18.1  m , 19.8  m , 22.0  m , and 23.8  m show that the stellar surface of r  cas is more complex than previously assumed .",
    "some of the theoretical models discussed above have an unusual wing - like visibility shape ( e.g. , p76200 in hsw98 ) .",
    "huge convection cells ( predicted by schwarzschild@xmath51 ) could also explain the observed visibility function .",
    "the visibility function of r  leo observed by perrin et al.@xmath52 with the iota interferometer has a similar wing - like shape as the r  cas visibility .",
    "perrin et al .",
    "discuss several physical phenomena which may explain the excess of visibility at high frequencies .",
    "the r  cas ud diameter measured at wavelength 1.04@xmath0 m at near - minimum phase 0.63 is 29.9mas@xmath23.0mas ( hbsw2000@xmath53 ) , i.e. , considerably larger than the above 25.3mas@xmath23.3mas ud diameter measured at 2.1  @xmath0 m at near - maximum phase 0.08 .",
    "the reason for this difference is not known and unexpected from the theoretical models discussed in the previous sections . the different variability phase of the two observations and/or other unknown effects , for example time - variable surface structure ( e.g. , supergranulation@xmath51 ) , are possibly the cause of the diameter difference .",
    "an angular r  cas rosseland radius @xmath5 of 12.1mas@xmath21.7mas at phase 0.08 was derived from the 2.1@xmath0 m visibilities measured with projected baselines between 12.0  m and 13.9  m by fitting theoretical center - to - limb variation profiles of five recent mira star models ( bsw96 , hsw98 ) . from the above mentioned 1.04@xmath0 m observation an angular rosseland radius r@xmath54 of 16.5mas@xmath21.7mas at phase 0.63 ( hbsw2000 ) , which is larger than the the near - maximum rosseland radius reported in this paper , was obtained ( hbsw2000 ; see above discussion ) .",
    "the effective temperature of 2685k@xmath2238k at near - maximum phase 0.08 was derived from the measured angular rosseland radius and jhklm - photometry carried out only seven days after the visibility observations .    for r  cas",
    "a good hipparcos parallax ( 9.36mas@xmath21.10mas ) is available and it is therefore possible to compare measured linear rosseland and stellar filter radii with the theoretical radii of the bsw96 and hsw98 models .",
    "the measured radii were derived by fitting theoretical ( bsw96 , hsw98 ) center - to - limb intensity variations to the low - frequency visibility data . in the following table",
    "we compare measured and theoretical values :    the comparison of these k - band ( 2.1@xmath0 m ) observations with theoretical models suggests that r  cas is well represented by the fundamental mode m and p model ( bsw96 , hsw98 ) , whereas the above mentioned 1.04@xmath0 m observations suggested first - overtone pulsation .",
    "however , observations in more filters than just one continuum filter may be necessary for safely distinguishing a well - fitting model from an accidental match ( cf . ref",
