    "many recent research programs in galaxy evolution trace changes in correlations between fundamental galaxy properties as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "one such approach compares the number density and luminosity function of galaxies at earlier times ( lilly  1995 ; bershady  1997 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; lin  1999 ) to the luminosity function in the nearby universe ( zucca  1997 ; marzke  1998 ; norberg  2002 ) .",
    "evidence suggests an increase in the number density of small , blue galaxies at earlier times with only a small amount of passive fading among the more luminous , redder galaxies .",
    "other investigations compare the relation between rotation velocity and luminosity ( t - f relation ; tully & fisher 1977 ) locally with that observed in more distant disk galaxies ( e.g. , forbes  1995 ; vogt  1996 , 1997 ; simard & pritchet 1998 ) .",
    "most results indicate that galaxies of a given rotational amplitude appear 0.2 - 1.0 mag brighter at @xmath13 , although bershady ( 1998 ) argue that the variation is significant for only the bluest galaxies , and kannappan , fabricant & franx ( 2002 ) show that tully - fisher residuals are strongly correlated with galaxy color .",
    "simard  ( 1999 ) find no evidence for evolution of the size - magnitude relation among 190 field galaxies out to @xmath14 in the groth strip ( groth 1994 ) .",
    "they show that selection effects favor high surface brightness galaxies in existing surveys .",
    "these biases may mimic the appearance of luminosity evolution and/or surface brightness evolution reported in many studies ( schade  1996a , 1996b ; roche  1998 ; lilly  1998 ) .",
    "yet another line of investigation compares the fundamental plane correlations for early - type galaxies as a function of epoch .",
    "recent results suggest a decrease in the mean mass - to - light ratio with lookback time for elliptical galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson  1997 ) . in paper x of this series ,",
    "i m ( 2001 ) found a brightening of 1 - 2 mag for early - type @xmath15 galaxies out to @xmath13 , and in paper ix of this series , gebhardt  find an increase in the surface brightness by a similar amount .    in this paper",
    "we explore the evolution of the correlation between metallicity , @xmath16 , and total luminosity , i.e. , the luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation to which nearly all types of _ local _ galaxies conform . in early - type systems ,",
    "absorption line indices provide a measure of the mean stellar iron or magnesium abundances ( faber 1973 ; brodie & huchra 1991 ; trager 1999 ) while in spiral ( zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) and dwarf systems ( lequeux  1979 ; french 1980 ; skillman , kennicutt , & hodge 1989 ; richer & mccall 1995 ) the  region oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen is the basis of the metallicity measurement . the luminosity - metallicity relation ( l - z )",
    "can be used as a sensitive probe and consistency check of galaxy evolution .",
    "the metallicity of a galaxy can only increase monotonically with time ( unless large - scale infall of primordial gas is invoked ) , while the luminosity may increase or decrease depending on the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "metallicity is less sensitive to variations due to transient star formation events in a galaxy s history .",
    "most models and observations of galaxies at earlier epochs predict higher star formation rates and a larger fraction of blue , star - forming galaxies in the past ( e.g. , madau  1996 ; lilly  1996 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "thus , a high or intermediate - redshift galaxy sample ought to be systematically displaced from the local sample in the luminosity - metallicity plane if individual galaxies participate in these cosmic evolution processes . however , if local effects such as the gravitational potential and `` feedback '' from winds and supernovae regulate the star formation and chemical enrichment process , then the l - z relation might be independent of cosmic epoch .",
    "semi - analytic models of somerville & primack ( 1999 ) , for example , show very little evolution of the l - z relation with redshift . one goal of this paper is to provide data capable of testing these alternative hypotheses .    at high redshift , absorption line surveys have been tracing the chemical evolution of the lyman - alpha forest and damped lyman - alpha systems for more than a decade ( bergeron & stasiska 1986 ; sargent  1988 ; steidel 1990 ; pettini  1997 ; lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 ; prochaska & wolf 1999 ) , while several studies have recently begun to trace the cosmic chemical evolution of _ individual galaxies _ with known morphological and photometric properties .",
    "kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) measured  region oxygen and nitrogen abundances for a sample of 14 compact star - forming galaxies with kinematically narrow emission lines in the range @xmath17 .",
    "their sample was found to conform to the local l - z relation , within observational uncertainties .",
    "carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) studied 13 star - forming galaxies at @xmath18 from the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly  1995 ) and found no significant evidence for evolution in the l - z relationship out to @xmath19 .",
    "however , at larger redshifts of @xmath20 , both kobulnicky & koo ( 2000 ) and pettini  ( 2001 ) found that lyman break galaxies with metallicities between @xmath21 are 2 - 4 magnitudes more luminous than local galaxies of similar metallicity .",
    "this deviation from the local l - z relation demonstrates that the luminosity - to - metal ratio varies throughout a galaxy s lifetime and is a potentially powerful diagnostic of its evolutionary state .    the deep ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ; vogt  2003 ; paper i ) team has been assembling keck spectroscopic data on galaxies in the groth strip survey ( groth 1994 ) in order to study the evolution of field galaxies .",
    "previous papers in this series include a study of the evolution of the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies ( paper ix ; gebhardt  2003 ) , the evolution of the luminosity function of e / s0 galaxies ( paper x ; i m  2001 ) , and the structural parameters of groth strip galaxies ( simard  2002 ; paper ii ) . in this paper , we explore the chemical properties of 64 star - forming emission - line field galaxies observed as part of the deep groth strip survey ( dgss ) .",
    "we measure the interstellar medium oxygen abundances using the the ratio of strong [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and h@xmath22 emission line equivalent widths ( e.g. , pagel  1979 as extended by kobulnicky & phillips 2003 ; hereafter kp03 ) .",
    "we analyze the degree of metal enrichment as a function of redshift , luminosity , and other fundamental parameters . throughout",
    ", we adopt a cosmology with @xmath23=70  mpc@xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .      in order to establish whether dgss galaxies systematically differ from nearby galaxies in their chemical or luminous properties , we require a suitable sample of local galaxies for comparison . for a comparable sample of local star - forming galaxies",
    ", we compiled three sets of emission - line galaxy spectra from the literature .",
    "the first set , consisting of 16 objects , comes from the 55-object spatially - integrated spectroscopic galaxy atlas of kennicutt ( 1992b ) supplemented by 6 objects from kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno ( 1999 ) .",
    "we refer to this as the k92 local sample . for each galaxy with",
    "detectable ( s / n@xmath278:1 ) [ o  ii]@xmath283727 , [ o  iii]@xmath284959 , [ o  iii]@xmath285007 , and h@xmath22 emission , we measured the emission - line fluxes and equivalent widths in the same manner as dgss galaxies described below . as a second local sample",
    ", we selected the compilation of nearby field galaxies from jansen  ( 2000a , b ; nfgs ) with integrated spectra , adopting their published emission - line fluxes and equivalent widths . the nearby field galaxy survey is a collection of 200 local ( @xmath29 ) morphologically diverse galaxies selected from the cfa i redshift catalog ( huchra 1983 ) which has the virtue of being nearly complete to the photographic limits of the survey .",
    "see jansen  ( 2000a ) for a discussion of the differences between the nfgs and k92 samples .",
    "briefly , the k92 objects have a higher fraction of star - forming galaxies ( objects with strong emission lines ) compared to the nfgs sample . as a third local sample , we chose the emission - line selected galaxies from the kitt peak national observatory spectroscopic survey ( kiss ; salzer 2000 ) . kiss is a large - area objective prism survey of local ( @xmath30 ) galaxies selected solely on the basis of strong @xmath31 emission lines . because of this selection criterion ,",
    "the kiss galaxies are preferentially gas - rich star - forming systems .",
    "kiss spectra were obtained using a fiber - fed spectrograph with 3  apertures , so , unlike the first two samples , the spectra are not spatially integrated ( i.e. , do not include the entire galaxy ) .",
    "the deep groth strip survey ( dgss ) consists of keck spectroscopy over the wavelength range @xmath324400    9500   obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke  1995 ) .",
    "the sample is magnitude limited at @xmath33 on the vega system .",
    "spectra have typical resolutions of @xmath3234  .",
    "integration times ranged from 3000 s to 18,000 s with a mean of around 6000 s. the spatial window of the spectral extraction was typically 1.5 .",
    "a full description appears in vogt  ( paper i in this series ; 2003 ) .",
    "we searched the spectroscopic database for galaxies in the groth strip survey with nebular emission lines suitable for chemical analysis . only galaxies where it was possible to measure all of the requisite [ o  ii]@xmath34 , h@xmath22 , [ o  iii]@xmath284959 , and [ o  iii]@xmath285007 lines were retained .",
    "these criteria necessarily exclude objects at redshifts of @xmath35 since the requisite [ o  ii]@xmath283727 line falls below the blue limit of the spectroscopic setup .",
    "likewise , objects with redshifts @xmath36 are excluded because the [ o  iii]@xmath285007 line falls beyond the red wavelength limit of the survey . as of february 2002",
    ", there were 693 objects with keck spectra with identified redshifts in the deep groth strip survey .",
    "of these 693 objects , 398 unique objects have spectroscopic redshifts within the nominal limits @xmath0 . the usable sample",
    "is further reduced because 23 candidates were positioned on the slitmask such that the [ o  iii ] lines fell off the red end of the spectral coverage .",
    "an additional 49 objects were rejected because their position on the slitmask caused the [ o  ii]@xmath283727 line to fall off the blue end of the spectral coverage .",
    "furthermore , atmospheric @xmath37 absorption troughs between 6865    6920   ( the `` b band '' ) and between 7585    @xmath38   ( the `` a band '' ) prohibit accurate measurement of emission lines for objects in particular redshifts ranges .",
    "we removed 14 objects from the sample in the redshift interval @xmath39 where the @xmath40 line falls in the b band .",
    "we removed 8 additional objects in the redshift interval @xmath41 where @xmath40 falls in the a band .",
    "we removed 24 objects in the redshift interval @xmath42 which places both [ o  iii ] @xmath284959 and [ o  iii ] @xmath285007 in the a band .",
    "the b band is sufficiently narrow that either [ o  iii ] @xmath284959 or [ o  iii ] @xmath285007 is always available for measurement . following this selection process",
    ", 276 objects remained .",
    "an additional 210 objects were removed from the sample because the @xmath40 emission line was absent or too weak ( s / n@xmath438:1 ) for reliable chemical determinations ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1999 for a discussion of errors and uncertainties ) .",
    "the spectra of objects rejected due to a weak @xmath40 line are usually dominated by stellar continuum rather than nebular emission from star - forming regions .",
    "most local early - type spirals and elliptical galaxies share these spectral characteristics . for these objects , h@xmath22 is seen in absorption against the stellar spectrum of the galaxy .",
    "thus early type galaxies with older stellar populations are preferentially rejected in favor of late type galaxies with larger star formation rates .",
    "there should , however , be no metallicity bias introduced by rejecting these 210 objects since we will compare the dgss sample with a local sample selected in the same manner : on the basis of @xmath40 , [ o  iii ] @xmath44 and [ o  ii ] @xmath34 emission lines measured with a signal - to - noise of 8:1 or better .    objects with strong @xmath40 but immeasurably weak [ o  ii ] or [ o  iii ] lines present a data selection conundrum . in principle , such objects should be included in the sample to avoid introducing a metallicity bias , but it is not possible to compute metallicities if the oxygen lines are not detected with n / n of 8:1 or better . only 3 such objects were found in the database . for these objects , it appears that poor sky subtraction caused the [ o  iii ] features to be immeasurably weak .",
    "intrinsically - weak oxygen lines may be caused by either extremely high ( @xmath45 ) or extremely low ( @xmath46 ) metal content . in the latter case ,",
    "oxygen lines are weak because of the lack of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ions . however , in the local universe , galaxies with extremely low intrinsic abundances are under - luminous ( @xmath49 ) , and no such faint galaxies are included in our sample . in the high - metallicity case , efficient cooling decreases the mean collisional excitation level , reducing the [ o  iii ] line strengths . however , the balmer lines and [ o  ii ] lines are not strongly affected by reductions in electron temperature .",
    "it is unlikely that our rejection criteria bias the sample by preferentially excluding either metal - poor or metal - rich systems .    of the original 693 objects ,",
    "66 galaxies remain .",
    "these objects appear in table  1 , along with their equatorial coordinates , redshift , absolute blue magnitude , restframe @xmath50 color in the johnson vega systems , half - light radius @xmath51 , and bulge fraction @xmath52 derived from model fitting routines ( simard  1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "the restframe ( @xmath53 and ( @xmath54 colors used in this work were calculated following the procedure of lilly  ( 1995 ) , by interpolating the measured v - i color of dgss galaxies over a subset of kinney  ( 1996 ) spectra , which were then used to synthesize the different restframe colors . figure  1 shows their redshifted spectra with major emission lines identified next to the f814w hst greyscale images .",
    "a cursory glance at the images reveals an assortment of galaxy types , from small compact objects to spiral disks and apparent mergers - in - progress .    in order to assess whether the 66 selected objects are representative of the 398 galaxies with spectra in the @xmath55 redshift range , figure  [ hist ]",
    "shows histograms of their morphological and photometric properties .",
    "the six panels show the redshift distribution @xmath56 , the absolute b magnitude @xmath57 , the rest - frame color @xmath50 , the half - light radius @xmath51 , the bulge fraction @xmath52 , and the total asymmetry index , @xmath58 .",
    "examination of figure  [ hist ] reveals that the 66 galaxies selected for chemical analysis are representative of the entire deep sample in terms of their luminosities , redshift distributions , sizes , and bulge fractions , but they are preferentially bluer and more asymmetric than the sample as a whole .",
    "this disproportionate fraction of asymmetric galaxies with strong emission lines may be understood as either 1 ) mergers which trigger star formation and produce  regions , or 2 ) isolated galaxies dominated by star - forming regions which give rise to an asymmetric morphology .",
    "the possible systematic effects introduced by the selection criteria will be discussed further below .",
    "spectra taken on different observing runs with different slitmasks enable us to combine multiple spectra for most dgss galaxies . after wavelength calibrating each spectrum , we combined the available 2-dimensional spectra to produce a master spectrum with higher signal - to - noise .",
    "the spectra are not flux calibrated .",
    "we manually measured equivalent widths of the emission lines present in each spectrum with the iraf splot routine using gaussian fits .",
    "the [ o  ii ] doublet , which is visibly resolved , was fit with two gaussian components and the sum recorded .",
    "table  1 lists the equivalent widths and measurement uncertainties for each line . where [ o  iii ] @xmath284959 was below our nominal s / n threshold of 8:1 , we calculated the ew based on the strength of [ o  iii ] @xmath285007 assuming an intrinsic ratio of 3:1 .",
    "the reported equivalent widths are corrected to the rest frame using    @xmath59    associated uncertainties are computed taking into account both the uncertainty on the line strength and the continuum level placement using    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are the line and continuum levels in photons and their associated @xmath65 uncertainties .",
    "we determine @xmath64 manually by fitting the baseline regions surrounding each emission line multiple times .",
    "we adopt @xmath66 where 12 is the number of pixels summed in a given emission line for this resolution , and rms is the root - mean - squared variations in an adjacent offline region of the spectrum . using this empirical approach ,",
    "the stated uncertainties implicitly include _ internal _ errors from one emission line relative to another due to poisson noise , sky background , sky subtraction , readnoise , and flatfielding . in nearly all cases",
    ", the continuum can be fit along a substantial baseline region , so that @xmath67 .",
    "there are , however , additional uncertainties on the _ absolute _ values of the equivalent widths due to uncertainties on the continuum placement , particularly for the [ o  ii ] @xmath283727 line , which are difficult to include in the error budget . for several objects ,",
    "the @xmath40 emission line falls on both the red and the blue halves of the spectrum so that two independent measurements of @xmath68 are available .",
    "in these five cases , the two measurements differ by up to 20% .",
    "this difference is understandable since the red and blue spectra were taken at different times during a night , separated by a periods of slitmask realignment and seeing variations .",
    "small positional changes of the slitmask may alter the region of the galaxy observed on the red versus blue spectra .",
    "thus , the absolute values of the equivalent widths may be uncertain by 20% . however",
    ", since we are primarily interested in the oxygen abundances derived from the ratios of these equivalent widths , the impact on the error budget is less severe when all emission lines are measured on the same exposure .",
    "this is rarely the case .",
    "[ o  iii ] and @xmath40 generally fall on the red spectrum and [ o  ii ] on the blue spectrum . to account for differences in sky subtraction and slitmask placement on the red versus blue spectra ,",
    "we therefore have assigned an uncertainty of 20% to the ew of [ o  ii ] @xmath283727 .",
    "this error is not reflected in column 13 of table  1 , but has been included in the oxygen abundance computations that follow .      in the analysis that follows",
    ", accurate assessment of chemical abundances in the warm ionized medium requires that the observed emission lines arise in h  ii regions powered by photoionization from massive stars .",
    "non - thermal sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) often produce emission - line spectra that superficially resemble those of star - forming regions .",
    "agn must be identified as such because blindly applying emission - line metallicity diagnostics calibrated from h  ii region photoionization models will produce erroneous metallicities .",
    "traditionally , agn can be distinguished from starbursts on the basis of distinctive [ n  ii]/h@xmath69 , [ s  ii]/h@xmath69 , [ o  i]/h@xmath69 , [ o  iii]/h@xmath22 , and [ o  ii]/[o  iii ] line ratios ( see heckman 1980 ; baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "however , some or most of these diagnostic lines are unobservable in the dgss and in the current generation of ground - based optical surveys at increasingly higher redshifts . with these limitations in mind ,",

    "oxygen is the most easily measured metal in  regions due to its strong emission lines from multiple ionization species in the optical portion of the spectrum .",

    "figure  [ lz ] shows that there is considerable dispersion among the local samples , such that some of the brightest , most metal - rich local galaxies overlap the @xmath7 l - z relation . at luminosities fainter than @xmath131 , however , local galaxies are all 1 - 3 magnitudes fainter , for a given metallicity , compared to the @xmath7 objects .",
    "the change in slope of the l - z relation at @xmath7 is in the sense that the low - luminosity dgss galaxies in this redshift interval show greater offsets from the local samples than the high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "the lack of dgss galaxies in the lower right corner of the plot ( low luminosity but high metallicity ) represents a real offset from the local relation and is not due any selection effect we can identify .",
    "galaxies that might occupy this locus near @xmath131 , @xmath132 would have measurable emission lines and line ratios , @xmath85 , identical to the more luminous galaxies with @xmath133 . although the ratios of [ o  iii ] and [ o  ii ] line strengths to h@xmath22 line strengths drop with increasing metallicity ,",
    "the sample selection process would not preferentially exclude objects with low [ o  iii]/h@xmath22 ( high metallicity ) in favor of those with high [ o  iii]/h@xmath22 ( low metallicity ) . if such low - luminosity , high - metallicity objects existed , they would have been detected and included in the analysis .",

    "in all those cases , poor sky subtraction is clearly the cause of the weak [ o  iii ] .",

    "although other selection effects in the local or distant samples may give the appearance of luminosity - metallicity evolution from @xmath136 to the present , we proceed in the next section to show that we can rule out several obvious selection biases .",
    "selection biases in the local and distant galaxy samples could produce the signature of an evolving l - z relation seen in figure  [ lz ] .",
    "for instance , comparing local galaxies having moderate @xmath68 to the rare dgss galaxies with strong starbursts and uncommonly large @xmath68 values could lead to misleading conclusions about the nature of distant versus local populations .",
    "we investigated sources of selection bias by examining the residuals in the l - z relation as a function of other fundamental galaxy parameters . using unweighted linear least - squares fits to the kiss , nfgs , and dgss samples separately , we computed residuals for each sample and searched within each sample for correlations with galaxy color , @xmath40 luminosity , size , and equivalent width .",
    "only @xmath68 is marginally correlated with l - z residuals , and only for the dgss galaxies .",
    "figure  [ lzresidew ] plots galaxy @xmath68 versus luminosity residuals , @xmath137 , from the above best - fit linear relation for each subgroup in the l - z plane .",
    "there is no correlation for the kiss sample or for the nfgs sample .",
    "we find a small trend for the highest - redshift dgss galaxies which is driven by the handful of galaxies with extreme values of @xmath68 , but the correlation coefficient indicates an equal or greater correlation could be achieved in a random sampling of points at least 20% of the time . _",
    "the lack of a significant correlation between magnitude residuals and @xmath68 is evidence against the hypothesis that extreme starbursts , which temporarily increase the emission line strength and overall luminosity , are a source of dispersion in the l - z relation . _ hence , the larger emission line equivalent widths in the dgss samples compared to the local samples do not bias the distant galaxies toward larger luminosities and are not responsible for the observed l - z relation offsets .",
    "further evidence for this conclusion comes from figure  [ lzlim ] , which shows only those dgss and local kiss , nfgs , and k92 galaxies with the restricted ew criterion @xmath138  .",
    "best fit lines to each sample show that the basic conclusion remains the same : distant dgss galaxies are 1 - 2 magnitudes more luminous than local galaxies of comparable metallicity .",
    "this result does not appear to be due to some kind of selection effect since the dgss sample analyzed here spans the entire range of luminosities from the entire dgss sample in each redshift interval , i.e. , we are not simply selecting the brightest objects from each redshift interval , as shown by figure  [ select ] .",
    "figure  [ select ] hints at another kind of selection effect which may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding differences between dgss and local galaxy samples .",
    "all of the dgss galaxies have very blue colors with @xmath139 , while only a small fraction of local galaxies are as blue .",
    "the dgss samples are likely to contain a larger fraction of extreme star - forming galaxies with younger light - weighted stellar populations . as a second means of examining selection / population differences between the local and dgss samples ,",
    "we have constructed a third version of figure  [ lz ] using only local galaxies with the bluest colors .",
    "figure  [ lzlimboth ] shows only those dgss and local k92 , kiss , and nfgs galaxies with @xmath139 _ and _ @xmath138  .",
    "although the number of nfgs and kiss data points are fewer , best fit lines to each sample and the basic conclusions remain the same . another way to look at this result is to say that the @xmath7 galaxies are 10% to 80% ( 0.04 to 0.25 dex , depending on @xmath57 ) more metal - poor than local galaxies of comparable luminosity .",
    "selection effects such as differences in color distributions or ew distributions between the local and dgss samples do not appear to be responsible for the observed variation of the l - z relation with epoch .      one straightforward interpretation of figure  [ lz ] , figure  [ lzlim ] , and figure  [ lzlimboth ] is to say that emission line galaxies _ have undergone considerable luminosity evolution , @xmath140 mag , from @xmath141 ( 7 gyr ago ) to the present and as much as @xmath142 mag since @xmath130 ( 11 gyr ago ) .",
    "_ this amount of brightening is consistent with , or greater than than , the interpretation of tully - fisher evolution studies out to @xmath13 ( e.g. , forbes , 1995 ; vogt  1997 ; simard & pritchet 1998 ; ziegler  2002 ) . an alternative way of understanding our new result is to say that emission - line field galaxies have experienced _ a measurable degree of metal enrichment ( up to a factor of 2.0 for the least luminous objects ) at constant luminosity _ since @xmath141 . the arrows in figure  [ lzlimboth ] indicate evolution in the l - z plane caused by constant star formation , passive evolution , metal - poor gas inflow , and star formation bursts and/or galaxy mergers .",
    "constant star formation drives galaxies mainly to the right in figure  [ lzlimboth ] ( i.e. , metal enrichment at constant luminosity ) while passive evolution moves galaxies downward ( i.e. , fading at constant metallicity ) .",
    "some combination of these two processes are probably responsible for evolving the @xmath143 galaxies into the region occupied by today s @xmath10 galaxies , provided that the evolved descendants of the dgss sample can be found among the local samples . given that many of the dgss galaxies appear to be disklike systems with active star formation , it is reasonable to suppose that a significant fraction of them are still disklike star - forming systems at the present epoch .    the apparent evolution in the luminosity - metallicity relation seen in figures  [ lz ] and [ lzlimboth ] stands in contrast to the conclusions of kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) and carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) , who found little or no evolution in the redshift ranges @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "open squares in figure  [ lz ] show that the cl01 objects fall at the high - luminosity end of the luminosity - metallicity correlation where the local and `` distant '' samples overlap .",
    "a comparison of the cl01 objects to the local samples and to the brightest dgss galaxies shows that they have luminosities and metallicities similar to our most luminous objects and are consistent with the l - z relation at that epoch .",
    "there is very little difference between the l - z relations at @xmath7 and @xmath10 at the luminous end .",
    "hence , the conclusion of cl01 , namely that their galaxies lie near the l - z relation for local galaxies , is appropriate given the restricted magnitude range of that sample .",
    "the new conclusion based on figure  [ lz ] is made possible by the addition of larger numbers of lower - luminosity galaxies which greatly extend the luminosity and metallicity baselines . although the kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) sample included a broad range of luminosities , the least luminous objects were at the lowest redshifts where offsets from local galaxies are least pronounced .",
    "furthermore , kobulnicky & zaritsky ( 1999 ) used a local comparison sample that included only a restricted subset of galaxies from the kennicutt ( 1992a , b ) spectral atlas .",
    "objects from this sample show increased scatter toward low metallicities at fixed luminosity , due mostly to the errors introduced by variable , unknown amounts of stellar balmer absorption .",
    "the increased scatter in the local sample masked the trend which has now become apparent in figure  [ lz ] . the global shift and slope change of the l - z relation between @xmath10 and @xmath136",
    "supports the conclusions of kobulnicky & koo ( 2000 ) , pettini  ( 2001 ) and mehlert  ( 2002 ) at higher redshifts , who found galaxies to be overly luminous for their metallicity at @xmath146 .    how do our results compare to conclusions about the evolution of the luminosity function ( lf ) ?",
    "lin  ( 1999 ) use early cnoc2 data on @xmath147 galaxies over the redshift range @xmath148 to conclude that , among late - type galaxies ( the ones most comparable to the dgss objects selected here ) , changes in the lf are most consistent with _ density _ evolution , and little or no _ luminosity evolution_. however , cohen ( 2002 ) , based on studies in the hubble deep field north vicinity over the redshift range @xmath149 , concluded that emission - line objects show _ moderate luminosity evolution _ and _ little density evolution_. interpreting figure  5 of lin ( 1999 ) as luminosity evolution suggests that , between @xmath150 and @xmath151 , late - type galaxies with @xmath131 fade by @xmath1521 mag , while galaxies with @xmath153 fade by @xmath154 mag .",
    "more recent results of wolf  ( 2002 ; combo-17 survey ) show a decrease in the luminosity of @xmath155 galaxies from z@xmath3 to the present by as much as 2 magnitudes , dpending on spectral type . given the uncertainties in the distant luminosity functions ,",
    "this amount of fading is consistent with the amount of fading required for the @xmath7 dgss galaxies to match the local l - z relation in figure  [ lz ] .",
    "however , this consistency does not prove the fading model , and other possibilities are discussed below .",
    "the addition of chemical information on galaxies at earlier epochs provides a new type of constraint on theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if local effects such as the gravitational potential and `` feedback '' from supernova - driven winds are the dominant regulatory mechanisms for star formation and chemical enrichment , then the l - z relation might be nearly independent of cosmic epoch .",
    "the semi - analytic models of kauffman ( 1996 ) and somerville & primack ( 1999 ) show little or no evolution in the l - z relation with epoch , although uncertainties in the model - dependent prescriptions for stellar feedback and galactic winds may have large impacts on the computed chemical and luminous properties . based on current understanding that the volume - averaged star formation rate was higher in the past ( pei & fall 1995 ; madau 1996 ) , and that the overall metallicity in the universe at earlier times was correspondingly lower , we might expect galaxies to be both brighter and more metal - poor in the past . a high- or intermediate - redshift galaxy sample ought",

    "galaxies begin as parcels of gas which form stars and produce metals as the gas fraction decreases from 100% to 0% .",
    "the b - band luminosity is related to the star formation history , which may vary as a function of time but is generally taken to be proportional to the mass or surface density of the remaining gas ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) . for a galaxy that evolves as a `` closed box '' , converting gas to stars with a fixed initial mass function and chemical yield , the metallicity is determined by a single parameter : the gas mass fraction , @xmath156 .",
    "the metallicity , @xmath16 , is the ratio of mass in elements heavier than he to the total mass and is given by    @xmath157    where @xmath158 is the `` yield '' as a mass fraction .",

    "garnett ( 2002 ) finds that oxygen yields of @xmath162 to @xmath163 among local irregular and spiral galaxies are correlated with galaxy mass , suggesting an increasing amount of metal loss among less massive galaxies .",
    "high - velocity winds capable of producing mass loss are observed in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , heckman  2000 ) and in high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( pettini  2001 ) , but the actual amount of mass ejected from galaxies is difficult to estimate .",
    "simulations indicate that winds may be metal - enriched , such that metals are lost from galaxies more easily than gas of ambient composition ( vader 1987 ; de young & gallagher 1990 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ) .",

    "we show later that allowing a range of @xmath177 provides a natural explanation for some of the features seen in the l - z relations .",
    "our goal in the pgase2 modeling was to reproduce the qualitative behavior of figure  [ lz ] where , 1 ) galaxies at @xmath178 are displaced toward brighter magnitudes and/or lower metallicities relative to their @xmath10 counterparts , and 2 ) dgss galaxies at @xmath7 exhibit a change in slope compared to more local l - z relations .",
    "a significant constraint on the models is the position of @xmath179 lyman break galaxies , which lie 2 - 4 magnitudes brighter ( 0.5 dex more metal - poor ) than the local l - z relation .",
    "if the present - day emission - line samples are at all representative of the evolved descendants of the @xmath7 and @xmath179 galaxies , ) that qualitatively resemble disks , and their bulge - to - disk ratios are @xmath180 . even if the current levels of star formation decline , their evolutionary descendants are likely to be systems with substantial disk components",
    "thus , it is plausible to think that the descendants of the @xmath7 dgss galaxies are disk - like star - forming galaxies today , similar to the k92 , kiss , and nfgs objects plotted in figure  [ lz].the evolutionary relationship between dgss and lyman break galaxies is less clear . ]",
    "then a successful model must reproduce the rapid rise in metallicity and luminosity in the first 2 - 3 gyr ( as evidenced by the lyman break galaxies ) , and it must reproduce the lack of significant l - z evolution during the past 2 - 3 gyr ( as evidenced by the similarity of the @xmath181 galaxies to the present - day l - z relation ) .",
    "this means that the rate of evolution of the l - z relation must be rapid during the first few gyr of a galaxy s formation , and it must then drop dramatically as a galaxy approaches the present - day l - z relation .",
    "furthermore , large luminous galaxies should slow their l - z evolution more than less luminous galaxies .",
    "a slowing of the luminous and/or chemical evolution of a galaxy must physically correspond either 1 ) to cessation of star formation and ultimately to depletion of the gas available to fuel star formation , or 2 ) to continued inflow of metal - poor gas which fuels star formation and dilutes the composition of the ism so that a galaxy remains fixed in l - z space .",
    "figure  [ lzevp2 ] shows evolutionary tracks of galaxies in the l - z plane based on the infall pgase2 models .",
    "the warm ism metallicity by mass , @xmath16 , is marked along the upper @xmath182-axis along with the corresponding closed - box gas mass fraction given by the models ( equivalent to the gas mass fractions predicted by equation  [ mu ] using a total yield of @xmath158=0.016 ) as a comparison .",
    "pentagons in figure  [ lzevp2 ] mark the model galaxies at ages of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 gyr ( from left to right ) .",

    "these models produce the rapid rise in metallicity in the first few gyr .",
    "these model masses are in reasonable agreement with observational estimates which place lower limits on the _ dynamical _ masses of @xmath179 lyman break galaxies at @xmath186  ( kobulnicky & koo 2000 ; pettini  2001 . ] and indicate star formation rates of @xmath3250 /@xmath187 . however , these models over - enrich the ism at late times after 8 gyr compared to the data .",
    "they predict gas mass fractions that are as low as 1% and metallicities as high as 3 times solar ( z=0.054 ) after 12 gyr , at odds with the observed properties of nearby galaxy samples .",
    "we can achieve better agreement between the models and data by varying several crucial model parameters .    *",
    "_ varying the sfr _ : lowering the model star formation rates would delay the chemical enrichment until later times and lower the luminosity at any given time .",
    "effectively , this change produces a wholesale shift in the model curves to the left and downward in figure  [ lzevp2 ] .",
    "however , lowering the sfr would also lower the predicted emission line equivalent widths which may already be too low in the models compared to the data ( mean of @xmath188 after 8 gyr versus 15 - 20   in the data ) . thus , changing the sfr does not improve the model agreement with the data .",
    "* _ varying the chemical yield , @xmath158 _ : as an experiment to produce models that better resemble the data , we introduced a metal yield efficiency parameter , @xmath189 , which reduces the effective yield of the models . reducing the chemical yields",
    "simply moves the model curves _ en masse _ to the left without changing the spacing of the model points ( i.e. , without changing the @xmath190 over a fixed time interval ) .",
    "physically , @xmath189 may represent the fraction of metals retained in galaxies during episodes of wind - driven metal loss , or it may represent a correction to the theoretical yields from stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ lzevp ] shows the same models and data as figure  [ lzevp2 ] , except that the metal yield has been reduced to 1/2 ( @xmath191 for @xmath192 ) .. ] the @xmath184  model with @xmath170 gyr is now in better agreement with the @xmath7 and @xmath10 data at ages of 8 - 12 gyr .",
    "however , the same model for @xmath185  becomes too metal - rich at ages of 8 - 12 gyr compared to the @xmath10 data .",
    "* _ varying @xmath168 _ : increasing the infall timescale from 1 gyr to 5 gyr , as shown in figure  [ lzevp ] , alters a galaxy s evolution in several respects .",
    "it significantly decreases the luminosity during the first few gyr , while producing a slight drop in the gas - phase metallicity at each timestep .",
    "longer @xmath168 also decreases the change in metallicity in each timestep , i.e. , decreases the @xmath190 over a fixed time interval , most noticeably at late epochs . in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm , the objects with the largest initial overdensities form most rapidly ( e.g. , blumenthal  1984 ; navarro , frenk , & white , 1995 ) . whether these first objects grow to become massive galaxies depends on the environment in which they are conceived .",
    "initial galaxy cores which collapse in the vicinity of larger concentrations of baryonic matter grow to become the massive galaxies at the centers of today s galaxy clusters .",
    "objects that form in regions of lower cosmological overdensity would accrete gas on longer timescales and , if isolated from external influences , would proceed more slowly through the star formation and chemical evolution process . a longer formation timescale for lower mass field galaxies observed in the dgss at @xmath7 can plausibly explain their observed evolution in the l - z relation .",
    "figure  [ lzevp ] demonstrates that @xmath183 gyr provides better agreement than the @xmath170 gyr to the @xmath7 and @xmath10 galaxies .",
    "however , we stress that a single set of model parameters can not reproduce either the l - z relation itself at _ any _ epoch or the variation in slope of the l - z relation with epoch .",
    "the l - z relation predicted by a single set of model parameters at any epoch would be a vertical line in figure  [ lzevp ] ! * _ varying @xmath193 _ : delaying the epoch at which model galaxies begin to assemble simply relabels the ages of models .",
    "for example , setting @xmath194 gyr instead of @xmath195 gyr renumbers the ages of the model points in figure  [ lzevp ] from 1,2,4,8,12 gyr to 0,1,3,7,11 gyr . for a given lookback time , the galaxies are younger .    the effects of decreasing @xmath158 , increasing @xmath168 , and increasing @xmath177 are , to some degree , degenerate .",
    "they all serve to move model points toward the left ( metal - poor ) side of figure  [ lzevp ] , and we can not , here , discriminate between their relative importance .",
    "however , within the context of these simple models , _ no single parameter can solely explain both the slope of the l - z relation and the change in slope with lookback time_. these observed qualities can only be produced in the context of the pgase2 models if at least _ two _ of the following conditions obtain : 1 ) the chemical yield of low - luminosity galaxies are reduced relative to high - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , garnett 2002 ) , 2 ) @xmath168 is larger for low - luminosity galaxies relative to high - luminosity galaxies , 3 ) @xmath193 is larger for low - luminosity galaxies relative to high - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , as in the delayed formation scenarios for dwarfs , babul & rees 1992 ) .",
    "such a scenario , whereby galaxies assembly timescales or formation epochs vary with environment , is similar to that proposed by sandage , freeman , & stokes ( 1970 ) to explain the differences along the hubble sequence .",
    "there is considerable observational support for the idea that lossy galactic winds remove metals and reduce the effective chemical yields from star formation ( e.g. , martin , kobulnicky & heckman 2002 ; garnett 2002 ) .",
    "winds are more effective in low - mass galaxies with lower gravitational potentials .",
    "the overall slope of the l - z relation may plausibly be explained by a decreasing effective yield in low - luminosity ( low - mass ) galaxies . some combination of longer @xmath168 , and/or later @xmath177 for low - mass galaxies",
    "may then be invoked to explain the change in slope of the l - z relation which preferentially displaces @xmath7 low - luminosity galaxies more dramatically from the local l - z relation .",
    "figure  [ lzevp4 ] uses the same pgase2 models to explore how one possible combination of reduced metal yields in low - mass galaxies relative to larger galaxies combined with a later formation epoch for low - luminosity galaxies , can come close to reproducing both the slope of the l - z relation _ and _ its zero point and slope variations with redshift .",
    "solid lines show the 5 gyr infall models from previous figures . as in figure",
    "[ lzevp ] , we use @xmath192 for the @xmath167  galaxy but here we choose @xmath196 for the @xmath166  galaxy .",
    "this variation in yield is well within the range found by garnett ( 2002 ) . for the @xmath167  galaxy",
    "we adopt a formation epoch @xmath195 gyr while for the @xmath166  galaxy we choose a formation epoch @xmath197 gyr .",
    "the numbers next to each model point denote the lookback time and the numbers in parentheses denote galaxy age .",
    "note how the slope of the l - z relation is in good agreement with a line connecting the model points at the present epoch , but it is in good rather poor with the slope of a line connecting the model points at a lookback time of 7 gyr ( roughly @xmath7 ) .",
    "moreover , the dgss galaxies at @xmath7 are , as a whole , more metal - rich than the model points at 7 gyr lookback times , indicating that these particular pgase2 models fail to reproduce ( i.e. , they overpredict ) the magnitude of zero - point evolution in the l - z relation .",
    "nevertheless , this combination of later formation epoch and reduced yield for low - mass galaxies does a reasonable job of reproducing the sense of the zero point and slope evolution in the l - z plane with redshift , especialyl for the low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "the largest discrepancies are for luminous galaxies whose gas - phase metallicity evolves less than the pgase2 models predict .",
    "as noted , the single - zone pgase2 models in the above figures fail to reproduce one important feature of the l - z relation data , namely , the observed lack of evolution for luminous galaxies between @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "all of the models in figures  [ lzevp2],[lzevp ] , and [ lzevp4 ] predict an increase of 0.2  0.4 dex in o / h between lookback times of @xmath198 gyr and the present .",
    "yet , the linear fits to the local and the @xmath7 dgss data indicate get little ( @xmath199 dex ) change in o / h for the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the only ways to decrease the @xmath201 per timestep withinthe framework of these single - zone models are 1 ) to drastically reduce the star formation rate , i.e. , to slow the conversion of gas into stars and heavy elements , or 2 ) to increase the infall timescale beyond the 5 gyr models .",
    "however , such a decrease in star formation rate or increase in @xmath168 would produce model galaxies which are dramatically more metal - poor and gas - rich at a given age compared to the present models , and would be in poor agreement between the models and the data .",
    "we can find no reasonable range of pgase2 model parameters which reproduce the similarity of luminous local galaxies to @xmath7 luminous dgss galaxies .",
    "the resolution to this crisis may lie in the considerable internal complexity of large spiral galaxies ( e.g. , radial chemical gradients , spatially variable extinction and star formation rates ) , which single - zone model like pgase2 do not include .",
    "more sophisticated models which treat galaxies as a collection of annuli with differing gaseous and chemical properties , for example , might more accurately reproduce the observed characteristics of the large galaxies seen locally and in the dgss .",
    "the lack of l - z evolution among luminous galaxies in figure  [ lzevp ] might be explained if star formation and chemical enrichment in these objects proceeds radially from the inside - out .",
    "if the star formation in local galaxies is dominated by activity at a larger radius than the star formation activity in @xmath7 dgss galaxies , then the luminosity - weighted dgss spectra will preferentially reflect the chemical composition at different ( i.e. , smaller ) galactocentric radii in dgss galaxies than in local galaxies .",
    "although local luminous spiral galaxies may , on whole , be substantially more metal - rich today than at @xmath7 , their emission line luminosities today would be dominated by star formation in comparably - enriched regions , but at larger radii , compared to the dgss galaxies .",
    "observations of the mean star formation radius within disk galaxies as a function of redshift could test this hypothesis . regardless of whether this particular hypothesis is true",
    ", additional information about the spatial distribution of star forming regions in distant objects ( e.g. , using the hubble space telescope ) , will lead to a greater understanding of the luminous and chemical histories of large galaxies .",
    "one additional free parameter not incorporated into the pgase2 models is the role of starbursts on timescales of a few myr that occur in galaxies that evolve on long ( gyr ) timescales according to the model prescriptions above .",
    "studies of local galaxies show that their star formation histories are not smooth but instead are punctuated by periods of enhanced activity .",
    "such short - term enhancements in the star formation rate of galaxies otherwise evolving smoothly can elevate the luminosity and emission line equivalent widths by factors of several .",
    "the observed emission line equivalent widths in dgss galaxies average 10 - 20  , but some exceed 50 ! these characteristics would be better fit by superimposing a burst of star formation of @xmath202  on the model galaxies .",
    "the impact of instantaneous bursts on the evolution in the l - z plane would be to create spikes along the model tracks toward higher luminosities .",
    "the amplitude of the spikes would scale with the amplitude of the burst , and could conceivably be up to several magnitudes and would persist up to a few 100 myr . given the morphological evidence for ongoing mergers among the dgss sample , evidenced by inspection of figure  1 , it seems possible that short - term enhancements in the star formation rate are responsible for the more extreme luminosities and emission line equivalent widths among the sample .",
    "examination of the pgase2 models used here shows that as the @xmath68 declines from 50   to 10  , the b - band luminosity drops by 0.7 mag . if we were to try to correct the magnitudes of the dgss samples by some factor to account for their larger equivalent widths compared to the local samples , this factor would be less than 0.7 mag , not enough to account fully for the larger 1 - 2 mag offsets observed in the l - z relations",
    "this is further evidence against the possibility that the offset of the l - z relation at @xmath203 is merely caused by starbursts with temporarily elevated luminosities and equivalent widths , although this may be part of the answer .",
    "observations of star - forming galaxies from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) survey of groth strip galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 show a correlation between b - band luminosity and ism oxygen abundance , like galaxies in the local universe . both the slope and zero - point of the l - z relation",
    "evolve with redshift .",
    "dgss galaxies are 13 mag more luminous at @xmath7 than @xmath10 galaxies of similar metallicity .",
    "said another way , galaxies of comparable luminosity are 0.1 - 0.3 dex more metal - rich at @xmath10 compared to @xmath7 . the change in slope of the l - z relation is most pronounced for dgss galaxies at @xmath7 and indicates that the apparent chemo - luminous evolution is more dramatic for the least luminous galaxies .",
    "we have ruled out several selection effects and biases in the galaxy samples which could produce this result .",
    "evolution of galaxies in the l - z plane over the redshift range @xmath204 to @xmath10 appears to result from a combination of fading and chemical enrichment for plausible single - zone galaxy evolution models . within the context of these models ,",
    "the slope of the l - z relation and the observed evolution of _ slope and zero - point _ with redshift imply that that at least two of the following are true for star - forming galaxies out to @xmath205 : 1 ) low - luminosity galaxies have lower effective chemical yields than massive galaxies , 2 ) low - luminosity galaxies assemble on longer timescales than massive galaxies , 3 ) low - mass galaxies began the assembly process at a later epoch than massive galaxies .",
    "comparison of observed ism metallicities to simple galaxy evolution models suggests that loss of up to 50% of the oxygen is necessary to avoid over - enriching the galaxies at the observed redshifts .",
    "while the models do a reasonable job of reproducing the evolution of the less luminous galaxies in our sample ( @xmath11 ) , the models do a poor job of reproducing the relative lack of chemo - luminous evolution seen among the luminous galaxies in our sample ( @xmath12 ) , suggesting a breakdown of the single - zone approximation .",
    "we predict that dgss galaxies have significantly higher ( 20%-60% ) gas mass fractions than comparably luminous local galaxies .",
    "such a systematic difference in the mean gas mass fractions of distant galaxies could , in principle , be observed with instruments such as the proposed radio - wave square kilometer array .",

    "<S> using spectroscopic data from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) groth strip survey ( dgss ) , we analyze the gas - phase oxygen abundances in the warm ionized medium for 64 emission - line field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies comprise a small subset selected from among 693 objects in the dgss . </S>",
    "<S> they are chosen for chemical analysis by virtue of having the strongest emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen range between @xmath1 with typical internal plus systematic measurement uncertainties of 0.17 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the 64 dgss galaxies collectively exhibit an increase in metallicity with b - band luminosity , i.e. , an l - z relation like that seen among local galaxies . using the dgss sample and local galaxy samples for comparison , we searched for a `` second parameter '' which might explain some of the dispersion seen in the l - z relation . </S>",
    "<S> parameters such as galaxy color , emission line equivalent width , and effective radius were explored but found to be uncorrelated with residuals from the the mean l - z relation .    </S>",
    "<S> subsets of dgss galaxies binned by redshift also exhibit l - z correlations with slopes and zero - points that evolve smoothly with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> dgss galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath2 ) are brighter , on average , by @xmath3 mag at fixed metallicity compared to the lowest dgss redshift bin ( @xmath4 ) and brighter by up to @xmath5 mag compared to local ( @xmath6 ) emission - line field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , dgss galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath2 ) are , on average , 40% ( 0.15 dex ) more metal - poor at fixed luminosity compared to local ( @xmath6 ) emission - line field galaxies . for @xmath7 galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the offset from the local l - z relation is greatest for objects at the low - luminosity ( @xmath8 ) end of the sample and vanishingly small for objects at the high - luminosity end of the sample ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these data to simple single - zone exponential - infall pgase2 models which follow the chemical and luminous evolution of galaxies from formation to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow range of model parameters can qualitatively produce the slope of the l - z relation and the observed evolution of slope and zero - point with redshift when at least two of the following are true : 1 ) low - mass galaxies have lower effective chemical yields than massive galaxies , 2 ) low - mass galaxies assemble on longer timescales than massive galaxies , 3 ) low - mass galaxies began the assembly process at a later epoch than massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the single - zone models do a reasonable job of reproducing the observed evolution for the low - luminosity galaxies ( @xmath11 ) in our sample , but fail to predict the relative lack of evolution in the l - z plane observed for the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more realistic multi - zone models will be required to explain the chemo - luminous evolution of large galaxies .    </S>"
