    "the 2013 nobel prize in physics was awarded to francois englert and peter higgs for their work in 1964 on the higgs mechanism , work that led in 2012 to the discovery at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) of the higgs boson after its being sought for almost 50 years .",
    "it is great tragedy that robert brout , the joint author with francois englert of one of the papers that led to the 2013 nobel prize , died in 2011 , just one year before the discovery of the higgs boson and two years before the awarding of the nobel prize for it .",
    "( for me personally this is keenly felt since my first post - doc was with robert and francois in brussels 1970 - 1972 . )",
    "the paper coauthored by englert and brout appeared on august 31 , 1964 in physical review letters @xcite after being submitted on june 26 , 1964 and was two and one half pages long .",
    "higgs wrote two papers on the topic .",
    "his first paper appeared on september 15 , 1964 in physics letters @xcite after being submitted on july 27 , 1964 and was one and one half pages long , and the second paper appeared on october 19 , 1964 in physical review letters @xcite after being submitted on august 31 , 1964 and was also one and one half pages long .",
    "thus a grand total of just five and one half pages .",
    "the significance of the higgs mechanism introduced in these papers and the higgs boson identified by higgs is that they are tied in with the theory of the origin of mass , and of the way that mass can arise through collective effects ( known as broken symmetry ) that only occur in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "such collective effects are properties that a system of many objects collectively possess that each one individually does not  the whole being greater than the sum of its parts .",
    "a typical example is temperature .",
    "a single molecule of @xmath0 does not have a temperature , and one can not tell if it was taken from ice , water or steam .",
    "these different phases are collective properties of large numbers of @xmath0 molecules acting in unison . moreover , as one changes the temperature all the @xmath0 molecules can act collectively to change the phase ( freezing water into ice for instance ) , with it being the existence of such phase changes that is central to broken symmetry .",
    "i counted at least 21 times that nobel prizes in physics have in one way or another been given for aspects of the problem : dirac ( 1933 ) ; anderson ( 1936 ) ; lamb ( 1955 ) ; landau ( 1962 ) ; tomonaga , schwinger , feynman ( 1965 ) ; gell - mann ( 1969 ) ; bardeen , cooper , schrieffer ( 1972 ) ; richter , ting ( 1976 ) ; glashow , salam , weinberg ( 1979 ) ; wilson ( 1982 ) ; rubbia , van der meer ( 1984 ) ; friedman , kendall , taylor ( 1990 ) ; lee , osheroff , richardson ( 1996 ) ; t hooft , veltman ( 1999 ) ; abrikosov , ginzburg , leggett ( 2003 ) ; gross , politzer , wilczek ( 2004 ) ; mather , smoot ( 2006 ) ; nambu , kobayashi , maskawa ( 2008 ) ; perlmutter , schmidt , reiss ( 2011 ) ; englert , higgs ( 2013 ) ; kajita , mcdonald ( 2015 ) . and",
    "this leaves out anderson who made major contributions to collective aspects of mass generation and yang who ( with mills ) developed non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories but got nobel prizes ( anderson 1977 , yang 1957 ) for something else .",
    "while the nobel prizes to mather and smoot and to perlmutter , schmidt , and reiss were for cosmological discoveries ( cosmic anisotropy and cosmic acceleration ) , because they tie in with the cosmological constant problem , a problem which itself ties in with mass generation and the higgs mechanism , i have included them in the list .",
    "since in the absence of any mass scales one has an underlying conformal symmetry , the interplay of mass generation with the cosmological constant problem , with this underlying conformal symmetry , and with its local conformal gravity extension will play a central role in this article , as i review the work and ideas that led up to the discovery of the higgs boson and then discuss its implications .",
    "as introduced by newton mass was mechanical .",
    "the first ideas on dynamical mass were due to poincare ( poincare stresses needed to stabilize an electron all of whose mass came from its own electromagnetic self - energy according to @xmath1 ) .",
    "however this was all classical .    with quantum field theory , the mass of a particle is able to change through self interactions ( radiative corrections to the self - energy  lamb shift ) to give @xmath2 , or through a change in vacuum ( bardeen , cooper , schrieffer  bcs theory ) according to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the self - consistent gap parameter .",
    "then through nambu ( 1960 ) and goldstone ( 1961 ) the possibility arose that not just some but in fact all of the mass could come from self interaction , and especially so for gauge bosons , viz .",
    "anderson ( 1958 , 1963 ) , englert and brout ( 1964 ) , higgs ( 1964 ) , guralnik , hagen , and kibble ( 1964 ) .",
    "this culminated in the weinberg ( 1967 ) , salam ( 1968 ) , and glashow ( 1961 , 1970 ) renormalizable @xmath5 local gauge theory of electroweak interactions , and the confirming discoveries first of weak neutral currents ( 1973 ) , then charmed particles ( 1974 ) , then the intermediate vector bosons of the weak interactions ( 1983 ) , and finally the higgs boson ( 2012 ) .",
    "all of this is possible because of dirac s hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics in which one sets @xmath6 , with the physics being in the properties of the states @xmath7 .",
    "we thus live in hilbert space and not in coordinate space , and not only that , there is altogether more in hilbert space than one could imagine , such as half - integer spin and collective macroscopic quantum systems such as superconductors and superfluids . in this hilbert space",
    "we find an infinite dirac sea of negative energy particles . because of their large number these degrees of freedom can collectively act to provide the dynamics needed to produce mass generation and the higgs boson .",
    "since mass generation generates contributions to the cosmological constant ( i.e. to the energy density of the vacuum ) , mass generation and the cosmological constant problem are intimately connected .",
    "moreover , since gravity couples to energy density and not just to energy density difference , gravity knows where the zero of energy is , to thus be sensitive to the mass generation mechanism .",
    "gravity and the mass generation mechanism thus inform each other .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson was announced by cern on july 4 , 2012 , accompanied by simultaneous announcements by the experimental groups atlas and cms at the large hadron collider at cern , as then followed by parallel publications that were simultaneously submitted to physics letters b on july 31 , 2012 and published on september 17 , 2012 , one publication by the atlas collaboration @xcite , and the other by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the atlas paper had 2924 authors , and the cms paper had 2883 .",
    "the higgs boson signature used by both collaborations was to look for the decay into lepton pairs of any higgs boson that might be produced in high energy proton proton collisions at the large hadron collider",
    ".    from amongst a set of @xmath8 proton - proton collisions produced at the large hadron collider , of the order of 240,000 collisions produce a higgs boson . of them just 350 decay into pairs of gamma rays and just 8 decay into a pair of leptons .",
    "the search for the higgs boson is thus a search for some very rare events .",
    "thus to see higgs bosons one needs an energy high enough to produce them and the sensitivity to see such rare decays when they are produced . in searches over the years",
    "it was not known in what energy regime to look for higgs particles , with the large hadron collider proving to be the collider whose energy was high enough that one could finally explore in detail the 125 gev energy domain where the higgs boson was ultimately found to exist .",
    "in order to characterize macroscopic ordered phases in a general way landau introduced the concept of a macroscopic order parameter @xmath9 . for",
    "a ferromagnet for instance @xmath9 would represent the spontaneous magnetization @xmath10 and would be a matrix element of a field operator @xmath11 in an ordered quantum state that described the ordered magnetic phase .",
    "building on this approach ginzburg and landau @xcite wrote down a lagrangian for such a @xmath9 for a superconductor , with kinetic energy @xmath12 and potential @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the critical temperature . for temperatures above the critical temperature",
    "the potential would have the shape of a single well , viz .",
    "like the letter u , with the coefficient of the @xmath15 term being positive , and with the potential minimum being at @xmath16 . for temperatures below the critical temperature the potential would have the shape of a double well , viz",
    ". like the letter w , with the coefficient of the @xmath15 term being negative , and with the potential minimum being at @xmath17 . above the critical temperature the order parameter would be zero at the minimum of the potential ( normal phase with state vector @xmath18 in which @xmath19 ) .",
    "below the critical temperature the order parameter would be nonzero ( superconducting state @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is nonzero ) .    in 1957",
    "bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer @xcite developed a microscopic theory of superconductivity ( bcs ) based on cooper pairing of electrons in the presence of a filled fermi sea of electrons , and explicitly constructed the state @xmath20 . in this state the matrix element @xmath22 was equal to a spacetime - independent function @xmath4 , the gap parameter , which led to a mass shift to electrons propagating in a superconductor of the form @xmath3 .",
    "the gap parameter @xmath4 would be temperature dependent ( @xmath23 ) , and would only be nonzero below the critical temperature . in 1959",
    "gorkov @xcite was able to derive the ginzburg - landau lagrangian starting from the bcs theory and identify the order parameter as the spacetime - dependent @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a coherent state in the hilbert space based on @xmath20 . in the superconducting case",
    "then @xmath9 is not itself a quantum - field - theoretic operator ( viz .",
    "a q - number operator that would have a canonical conjugate with which it would not commute ) but is instead a c - number matrix element of a q - number field operator @xmath26 in a macroscopic coherent quantum state .    in 1958",
    "anderson @xcite used the bcs theory to explain the meissner effect , an effect in which electromagnetism becomes short range inside a superconductor , with photons propagating in it becoming massive .",
    "the effect was one of spontaneous breakdown of local gauge invariance , and was explored in detail by anderson @xcite and nambu @xcite .    in parallel with these studies",
    "nambu @xcite , goldstone @xcite , and nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite explored the spontaneous breakdown of some continuous global symmetries and showed that collective massless excitations ( goldstone bosons ) were generated , and that the analog gap parameter would provide for dynamically induced fermion masses . in 1962 goldstone , salam , and weinberg @xcite showed that there would always be massless goldstone bosons in any lorentz invariant theory in which a continuous global symmetry was spontaneously broken . while one could avoid this outcome if the symmetry was also broken in the lagrangian , as was , through the weak interaction , thought to be the case for the pion , a non - massless but near goldstone particle ( i.e. one with broken symmetry suppressed couplings to matter at low energies ) , in general the possible presence of massless goldstone bosons was a quite problematic outcome because it would imply the existence of non - observed long range forces .    in 1962",
    "schwinger @xcite raised the question of whether gauge invariance actually required that photons be massless , and noted for the photon propagator @xmath27 $ ] that if the vacuum polarization @xmath28 had a massless pole of the form @xmath29 , @xmath30 would behave as the massive particle @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "a massless goldstone boson could thus produce a massive vector boson .    with anderson",
    "having shown that a photon would become become massive in a superconductor , there was a spirited discussion in the literature ( anderson @xcite , klein and lee @xcite , gilbert @xcite ) as to whether an effect such as this might hold in a relativistic theory as well or whether it might just have been an artifact of the fact that the bcs theory was non - relativistic . with the work of englert and brout @xcite and higgs @xcite , and then guralnik , hagen , and kibble @xcite , the issue was finally resolved , with it being established that in the relativistic case the goldstone theorem did not in fact",
    "hold if there was a spontaneous breakdown of a continuous local theory , with the would - be goldstone boson no longer being an observable massless particle but instead combining with the initially massless vector boson to produce a massive vector boson .",
    "technically , this mechanism should be known as the anderson , englert , brout , higgs , guralnik , hagen , kibble mechanism , and while it has undergone many name variations over time , it is now commonly called the higgs mechanism .",
    "what set higgs work apart from the others was that in his 1964 physical review letters paper higgs noted that as well as a massive gauge boson there should also be an observable massive scalar boson , this being the higgs boson .    at the time of its development in 1964",
    "there was not much interest in the higgs mechanism , with all of the englert and brout , higgs , and guralnik , hagen and kibble papers getting hardly any citations during the 1960s at all .",
    "the primary reason for this was that at the time there was little interest in non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories in general , broken or unbroken , and not only was there no experimental indication at all that one should consider them , it was not clear if yang - mills theories were even quantum - mechanically viable .",
    "all this changed in the early 1970s when t hooft and veltman showed that these theories were renormalizable , and large amounts of data started to point in the direction of the relevance of non - abelian gauge theories to physics , leading to the @xmath32 picture of strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions , which culminated in the discoveries of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 intermediate vector bosons ( 1983 ) with masses that were generated by the higgs mechanism , and then finally the higgs boson itself ( 2012 ) .",
    "what gave the higgs boson the prominence that it ultimately came to have was the realization that in the electroweak @xmath5 theory the higgs boson not only gives masses to the gauge bosons while maintaining renormalizability , but through its yukawa couplings to the quarks and leptons of the theory it gives masses to the fermions as well .",
    "the higgs boson is thus responsible not just for the masses of the gauge bosons then but for the masses of all the other fundamental particles as well , causing it to be dubbed the  god particle \" .",
    "even though broken symmetry is an intrinsically quantum - mechanical phenomenon , one can illustrate many of the aspects needed to understand the higgs boson by considering properties not of a q - number quantum field such as a quantum scalar field @xmath36 but of its c - number vacuum matrix element @xmath37 .",
    "below we shall explore the quantum mechanics of broken symmetry , but for pedagogical purposes it is convenient to first proceed as though one could treat the problem classically by studying properties of the c - number @xmath38 without needing to delve into its origin or significance .    thus consider a real classical scalar field ( just one degree of freedom ) with a potential energy in the form of the double - well potential shown in fig .",
    "( [ mhd ] ) , viz . a potential shaped like a letter w with two wells :",
    "@xmath39 this potential has a discrete symmetry under @xmath40 , with its first two derivatives being given by @xmath41 the potential has a local maximum at @xmath16 where @xmath42 is zero and @xmath43 is negative , and two - fold degenerate global minima at @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 and @xmath48 is positive . since @xmath16 is a local maximum , if we consider small oscillations around @xmath16 of the form @xmath49 we generate a negative quadratic term @xmath50 and a thus negative squared mass , viz .",
    "@xmath51 , a so - called tachyon .",
    "the tachyon signals an instability of the configuration with @xmath16 ( i.e. we roll away from the top of the hill ) .",
    "however if we fluctuate around either global minimum ( i.e. we oscillate in the vertical around either of the two valleys ) by setting @xmath52 we get @xmath53 the field @xmath54 now has the positive squared mass @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus ( goldstone @xcite ) the would - be tachyonic particle becomes a massive particle , and with one scalar field we obtain one particle .",
    "this particle is the higgs boson in embryo .",
    "the @xmath47 potential term contributes to the cosmological constant , and would be unacceptably large ( @xmath57 times too large ) if the boson has the 125 gev mass that the higgs boson has now been found to have .",
    "all this arises because the minimum is two - fold degenerate , and picking either one breaks the symmetry spontaneously , since while one could just as equally be in either one minimum or the other , one could not be in both .",
    "this is just like people at a dinner .",
    "each one can take the cup to their left or their right , but once one person has done so , the rest have no choice .",
    "however a person at the opposite end of the table may not know what choice was made at the other end of the table and may make the opposite choice of cup , and thus persons in the middle could finish up with no cup . to ensure that this does not happen",
    "we need long range correlations  hence massless goldstone bosons .",
    "-0,5 in    -0.6 in    consider a complex scalar field ( two degrees of freedom ) @xmath58 , @xmath59 , with a potential energy in the shape of a rotated letter w or a broad - brimmed , high - crowned mexican hat as exhibited in fig .",
    "( [ mhc ] ) , viz .",
    "@xmath60    the potential has a continuous global symmetry of the form @xmath61 with constant @xmath62 , with derivatives @xmath63 this potential has a local maximum at @xmath64 where @xmath42 is zero , and infinitely degenerate global minima at @xmath65 ( the entire 360 degree valley or trough between the brim and the crown of the mexican hat ) .",
    "again we would have a tachyon if we expand around the local maximum , only this time we would get two . however , if we fluctuate around any one of the global minima by setting @xmath66 , @xmath67 , we get @xmath68 the ( embryonic ) higgs boson field is now @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "however , the field @xmath71 no has no mass at all @xcite ( it corresponds to horizontal oscillations along the valley floor ) , and is called a goldstone boson or , because of nambu s related work , a nambu - goldstone boson . thus from a complex scalar field we obtain two particles . since the goldstone boson is massless , it travels at the speed of light .",
    "it is thus intrinsically relativistic , and being massless can provide for long range correlations .",
    "moreover , if such particles exist then they could generate fermion masses entirely dynamically ( nambu @xcite , and nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite ) , with the pion actually serving this purpose .",
    "the @xmath47 potential term remains and the cosmological constant problem is just as severe as before .",
    "now if we have massless particles , we would get long range forces ( just like photons ) , and yet nuclear and weak forces are short range .",
    "so what can we do about such goldstone bosons .",
    "two possibilities - they could get some mass because the symmetry is not exact ( pion mass ) , or we could get rid of them altogether ( the higgs mechanism ) .      consider the model studied by higgs @xcite consisting of a complex scalar field ( two degrees of freedom ) coupled to a massless vector gauge boson ( another two degrees of freedom ) for a total of four degrees of freedom in all , viz .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the system has kinetic energy @xmath75 and potential energy @xmath76 : @xmath77 and because of the gauge boson the system is now invariant under continuous local gauge transformations of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 with spacetime dependent @xmath80 .",
    "with derivatives @xmath81 the potential has a local maximum at @xmath82 where @xmath83 is zero and degenerate global minima at @xmath84 ( infinitely degenerate since independent of @xmath85 ) .",
    "again we would have two tachyons if we expand around the local maximum .",
    "so fluctuate around the global minimum by setting @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "on defining @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 there is again a higgs boson field @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "however , the field @xmath71 has disappeared completely .",
    "instead the vector boson now has a nonzero mass given by @xmath90 .",
    "since a massive gauge boson has three degrees of freedom ( two transverse and one longitudinal ) while a massless gauge boson such as the photon only has two transverse degrees of freedom , the would - be massless goldstone boson is absorbed into the now massive gauge boson to provide its needed longitudinal degree of freedom .",
    "hence a massless goldstone boson and a massless gauge boson are replaced by one massive gauge boson , with two long - range interactions being replaced by one short range interaction .",
    "this is known as the higgs mechanism though it was initially found by anderson @xcite in his study of the meissner effect in superconductivity .",
    "the remaining fourth of the original four degrees of freedom becomes the massive higgs boson , and its presence is an indicator that the higgs mechanism has taken place .",
    "however , with the presence of @xmath47 term in @xmath76 , the cosmological constant problem remains as severe as before .",
    "to discuss broken symmetry in quantum field theory it is convenient to introduce local sources . in the gell - mann - low adiabatic switching procedure one introduces a quantum - mechanical lagrangian density @xmath91 of interest , switches on a real local c - number source @xmath92 for some hermitian quantum field @xmath36 at time @xmath93 , and switches @xmath92 off at @xmath94 . while the source is active the lagrangian density of the theory",

    "the search for non - trivial minima of @xmath76 is actually a search for states @xmath20 in which @xmath141 would be negative . thus while the analyses presented above in sec .",
    "( 4 ) looked to be classical they actually had a quantum - mechanical underpinning with the classical field being a c - number vacuum matrix element of a q - number quantum field .",
    "it is in this way that the classical analyses presented above are to be understood .      to understand the nature of a broken symmetry vacuum it is instructive to reconsider @xmath108 .",
    "it is associated with a system @xmath97 to which an external field has been added .",
    "this external field breaks the symmetry by hand at the level of the lagrangian since an effective potential such as @xmath142 would be lopsided with one of its minima lower than the other , and would not have any @xmath143 symmetry .",
    "such a situation is analogous to that found in a ferromagnet . in the presence of an external magnetic field ( cf .",
    "@xmath109 ) all the spins line up in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "if one is above the critical temperature , then when one removes the magnetic field the spins flop back into a configuration in which the net magnetization is zero .",
    "however , if one is below the critical point , the spins stay aligned and remember the direction of the magnetic field after it has been removed ( hysteresis ) .",
    "moreover , if the magnetic field is taken to point in some other direction , below the critical point the spins will remember that direction instead , and will remain aligned in that particular direction after the magnetic field is removed . for a spherically symmetric ferromagnetic system at a temperature below the critical point one can thus align the magnetization at any angle @xmath85 over a full @xmath144 to @xmath145 range , and have it remain aligned after the magnetic field is removed .",
    "given all the different orientations of the magnetization that are possible below the critical point , we need to determine in what way we can distinguish them . so consider a single spin pointing in the @xmath146-direction with spin up , and a second spin pointing at an angle @xmath85 corresponding to a rotation through an angle @xmath85 around the @xmath147 axis .",
    "for these two states the overlap is given by @xmath148 with the overlap being nonzero and with the two states thus necessarily being in the same hilbert space .",
    "suppose we now take an @xmath149-dimensional ensemble of these same sets of spin states and evaluate the overlap of the state with all spins pointing in the z - direction and the state with all spins pointing at an angle @xmath85 .",
    "this gives the overlap @xmath150 in the limit in which @xmath149 goes to infinity this overlap goes to zero . with this also being true of excitations built out of these states ,",
    "the two states are now in different hilbert spaces .",
    "thus broken symmetry corresponds to the existence of different , inequivalent vacua , and even though the various vacua all have the same energy ( i.e. degenerate vacua ) , the vacua are all in different hilbert spaces .",
    "the quantum hilbert spaces associated with the various minima of the effective potential ( i.e. the differing states @xmath151 in which the vacuum expectation values @xmath152 are evaluated ) become distinct in the limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom , even though they would not be distinct should @xmath149 be finite .",
    "broken symmetry is thus not only intrinsically quantum - mechanical , it is intrinsically a many - body effect associated with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",

    "we can also use the renormalization group equation in the @xmath434 region , and inserting either @xmath474 or @xmath475 into ( [ m83 ] ) yields @xmath476=-1 , \\label{m85}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the real part of @xmath460 , viz .",

    "one should expect a discontinuity in @xmath460 rather in @xmath459 , since it is @xmath457 that is the mass operator .",
    "thus if any discontinuity is to herald a dynamical mass generation phase transition , it should be in the mass operator sector rather than in the charge operator sector .",
    "the objective of the study of johnson , baker , and willey @xcite was not to study dynamical symmetry breaking per se , but to determine whether it might be possible for all the renormalization constants of a quantum field theory to be finite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics was a particularly convenient theory to study since its gauge structure meant that two of its renormalization constants ( the fermion wave function renormalization constant @xmath484 and the fermion - antifermion - gauge boson vertex renormalization constant @xmath485 to which @xmath484 is equal ) were gauge dependent and could be made finite by an appropriate choice of gauge , with the anomalous dimension of the fermion @xmath486 associated with @xmath484 consequently then being zero .",
    "johnson , baker , and willey were thus left with the gauge boson wave function renormalization constant @xmath487 and the fermion bare mass @xmath488 and its shift @xmath489 to address .",
    "now if one were also to consider the coupling of electrodynamics to gravity , one would then have to address another infinity that electrodynamics possesses , namely that of the zero - point vacuum energy density , and we will return to this issue below .",
    "however , in the flat spacetime study that johnson , baker , and willey engaged in , the need to address the vacuum energy density infinity did not arise , and it could be normal ordered away .",
    "as regards @xmath487 and @xmath488 , johnson , baker and willey showed that @xmath487 would be finite if the fermion - antifermion - gauge boson coupling constant @xmath62 was at a solution to the gell - mann - low eigenvalue condition . at this eigenvalue",
    "they showed that the fermion propagator would scale asymptotically as in ( [ m84 ] ) , and that the bare mass would scale as @xmath490 where @xmath315 is an ultraviolet cutoff and @xmath2 is the renormalized fermion mass .",
    "consequently if the power @xmath460 is negative ( which it perturbatively is : @xmath491 ) , the bare mass would vanish in the limit of infinite cutoff and @xmath489 would be finite .",
    "thus the mechanism for both the finiteness and vanishing of @xmath488 is to have the dimension of @xmath298 be less than canonical . in ( [ m86 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath492 .",
    "even though each term in the series diverges , their coefficients are fixed by the vanishing of @xmath459 so that the series exponentiates . ] as such , the work of johnson , baker , and willey was quite remarkable since it predated the work of wilson and of callan and symanzik on critical scaling , anomalous dimensions , and the renormalization group .      with the vanishing of the bare mass and the non - vanishing of the physical mass , it looks as though there should be dynamical mass generation and an associated goldstone boson , with jbw electrodynamics then becoming a possible laboratory in which to explore dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "however , this turned out not to be the case due to a hidden renormalization effect in the theory @xcite , one associated with the renormalization constant @xmath493 that renormalizes @xmath298 according to @xmath494 @xcite . specifically , given ( [ m86 ] )",
    ", it follows that as @xmath488 vanishes the quantity @xmath495 diverges at the same rate so that @xmath496 is finite",
    ". then if @xmath201 is non - zero , the bare @xmath497 is non - zero too .",
    "the solution associated with ( [ m86 ] ) thus corresponds to a theory in which a term @xmath497 is present in the lagrangian from the outset . the chiral symmetry is thus broken in the lagrangian and there is no associated goldstone boson .",
    "this then is the evasion of the goldstone theorem as found by baker and johnson @xcite .",
    "since the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem would hold in any theory in which the bare mass has a negative power dependence on the cutoff , it follows that this must also be the case in the quenched ladder approximation to the abelian gluon model in the @xmath431 region .",
    "hence the branch point in @xmath430 at @xmath433 separates two distinct phases . at or below @xmath433",
    "there is no goldstone boson , while above @xmath433 there is .",
    "now suppose that a priori one did not know whether or not the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem applied below @xmath433 . if one had set the bare mass equal to zero in an equation such as ( [ m74 ] ) right at the beginning of the calculation , one would have come to the conclusion that with an identically zero @xmath488 and the power - behaved solution given in ( [ m77 ] ) , equation ( [ m74 ] ) would exist without renormalization and lead to self - consistent mass generation .",
    "one would thus have concluded that even in the @xmath431 region there should be a goldstone boson , with a self - consistently non - zero @xmath387 , and a self - consistently non - zero fermion mass , generating themselves in the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "however , if we first introduce both a bare mass and a cutoff and then solve ( [ m74 ] ) asymptotically , we would find that for @xmath469 the bare mass as given in ( [ m77 ] ) would actually be non - zero . then with @xmath488 as given in ( [ m77 ] ) vanishing in the limit of infinite cutoff we would know that we are in fact in the baker - johnson situation .",
    "thus to check whether or not we might be in the baker - johnson situation , even if we are in a renormalizable and seemingly chiral - symmetric theory , we should nonetheless study the schwinger - dyson equation with a cutoff .",
    "associated with the bilinear source @xmath265 approach of @xcite . while this would then permit non - trivial solutions to the schwinger - dyson equation to be energetically favored",
    ", this would not necessarily mean that in them the bare mass would be identically zero and that one would have dynamical symmetry breaking , since if one has an asymptotically power - behaved solution to the schwinger - dyson equation , one would be in the baker - johnson situation where despite appearances the chiral symmetry would actually be broken in the lagrangian . in and of itself",
    "the effective action approach of @xcite does not distinguish between a bare mass that is zero or one that only vanishes in the limit of infinite cutoff , as this is determinable not from the form of the unconstrained action itself but from the structure of its stationary solution .",
    "]    with the realization that there is no goldstone boson when @xmath469 , the prevailing wisdom that then ensued from the quenched ladder approximation study is that goldstone boson generation is strictly a strong coupling effect , with the @xmath431 region not being of relevance to dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "below we shall revisit this issue and show that it is possible to generate goldstone and higgs bosons dynamically even if the coupling is weak . to do this",
    "we will need to couple a weakly coupled qed to an equally weakly coupled four - fermion interaction .",
    "however , before doing this we need to ask how reliable a guide to dynamical symmetry breaking the quenched ladder approximation actually is .",
    "to determine how relevant the wisdom obtained from the quenched planar approximation to the abelian gluon model might be for the full theory , we need to include the non - planar graphs and need to dress the gluon propagator .",
    "inclusion of all the feynman graphs was the objective of johnson , baker , and willey in their study of quantum electrodynamics . in their study of quantum electrodynamics johnson , baker , and willey initially kept the photon propagator canonical @xcite ( i.e. no internal fermion loops in the photon propagator ) with the photon propagator thus being quenched , but they otherwise included both planar and non - planar graphs to all orders , to thus include the full @xmath498 vertex in the schwinger - dyson equation rather than just its undressed @xmath390 approximation . in @xcite",
    "they then found that the fermion self - energy then scaled asymptotically just as in ( [ m84 ] ) , i.e. as @xmath499 .",
    "moreover , johnson , baker and willey noted that their analysis only depended on the asymptotic momentum behavior of feynman diagrams and not on the strength of the coupling .",
    "their analysis thus holds for both weak and strong coupling , and as such shows no region in which a power - behaved solution changes into an oscillating one such as the one exhibited in ( [ m78 ] ) , with the power - behaved , and thus non - goldstone mode , solution holding for all values of the coupling constant .",
    "thus in the quenched but otherwise all - order approximation to the abelian gluon model , the phase transition at @xmath433 in the planar approximation is nullified by the non - planar graphs , and one has to conclude that in the full planar plus non - planar quenched gluon approximation there is no goldstone boson",
    ".    as had been noted above , in the quenched ladder approximation we keep graphs such as the first two graphs in fig .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) and their higher - order planar analogs but do not include the non - planar third graph or its higher - order non - planar analogs . however , the second and the third graphs in fig .",

    "their neglect is thus only valid if the coupling is weak .",
    "the quenched planar approximation is thus strictly a weak coupling approximation , with its application in the strong coupling regime where @xmath62 is of order @xmath451 potentially not being valid , and with the strong coupling wisdom that is gleaned from the quenched ladder approximation not being reliable .    to see",
    "exactly at what point the quenched ladder approximation begins to depart from the quenched , all - order johnson - baker - willey ( jbw ) study reported in @xcite , we note that through second order in @xmath62 the contribution of all graphs gives @xcite @xmath501 , whereas , as per ( [ m77 ] ) , the expansion of @xmath502 to second order is given by @xmath503 .",
    "thus , as can be anticipated from the graphs in fig .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) , already at the level of the two - photon graphs @xmath460 and @xmath504 begin to depart from each other , and yet the compatibility of ( [ m77 ] ) and ( [ m84 ] ) would require that @xmath460 and @xmath504 be equal .",
    "the extrapolation of the @xmath502 expression beyond lowest order is thus not justifiable , with the branch point obtained in @xmath430 at @xmath433 in the quenched planar approximation being an indicator not that there is a phase transition , but that the extrapolation is problematic .    in @xcite johnson , baker , and",
    "willey went further and actually justified the restriction to a canonical photon by noting that the photon would indeed be canonical if the coupling constant satisfied the gell - mann - low eigenvalue condition , and thus satisfied @xmath467 .. ] thus whether one takes the photon to be quenched or takes it to couple with a charge that obeys @xmath467 , in either case the power - behaved @xmath499 asymptotic behavior is the only allowed solution , with there being no sign of any phase transition .",
    "moreover , if one is at the gell - mann - low eigenvalue , the coupling constant would only have one ( or possibly a few ) discrete values , with there then being no possibility of being able to vary @xmath62 over the entire coupling constant range and look for any discontinuity in the first place .",
    "other than the fact that a zero of @xmath459 ( should it have one ) might be at a location other than @xmath433 , the wisdom obtained in the quenched ladder approximation at @xmath433 does dovetail with that found by johnson , baker , and willey at a gell - mann - low eigenvalue , i.e. there is asymptotic scaling but no goldstone boson .",
    "as we will see , the correspondence is even stronger since in both the cases the dimension of @xmath463 is reduced from three to two . in the quenched ladder approximation",
    "this follows directly from ( [ m77 ] ) at @xmath433 , while in the johnson , baker , and willey case it is , as we show below , the condition @xcite that the vacuum spontaneously break .",
    "-0.3 in    beyond the issue of the validity of the quenched ladder approximation , there may also be a possible counting issue . specifically ,",
    "if we want to calculate the one - point function expectation value @xmath505 in the quenched ladder approximation , we would just sew together the two ends of the fermion propagator ( cf . the planar part of fig .",

    "nonetheless , it is of interest to ask whether one can still find a way to get dynamical symmetry breaking in the event that there is such scaling . as noted in @xcite and @xcite , this does occur if a massless fermion electrodynamics with scaling is coupled to a four - fermion interaction , with the driver being a reduction in the dynamical dimension of @xmath463 from three to two . to this end",
    "we need to reinterpret jbw electrodynamics as the mean - field sector of a massless fermion electrodynamics theory coupled to a four - fermion interaction , since as we saw with the chirally - symmetric njl model , the mean - field sector contains an explicit non - chirally - symmetric fermion mass term and possesses no goldstone boson , just as jbw electrodynamics contains an explicit fermion mass term and involves no goldstone boson . however , as we also saw in the njl model , a dynamical pseudoscalar goldstone boson is instead generated by an accompanying residual interaction .",
    "we shall find precisely the same residual interaction effect when a massless electrodynamics with scaling is coupled to a four - fermion interaction , and because of the underlying chiral symmetry , we shall obtain a dynamical scalar higgs boson as well .",

    ", it became clear that gravitational cosmology was equally aware of the quantum nature of gravitational sources . to get round the fact that the gravity side of the einstein equations is classical ( @xmath773 )",
    "while the matter side is quantum - mechanical , one replaces ( [ m166 ] ) by a hybrid @xmath774 in appropriate states @xmath410 .",
    "however , since the matter term in ( [ m167 ] ) consists of products of quantum matter fields at the same spacetime point , the matter term has a zero - point problem .",
    "but since the gravity side of ( [ m167 ] ) is finite , it can not be equal to something that is infinite .",
    "thus one must find a mechanism to cancel infinities on the matter side , and must find one that does so via the matter side alone .",
    "however instead , in the literature one commonly ignores the fact that gravity is to couple to all forms of energy density rather than only to energy density differences , and subtracts off ( i.e. normal orders away ) the zero - point infinity by hand and replaces ( [ m167 ] ) by the finite ( @xmath775 ) @xmath776 thus in treating the contribution of the electron fermi sea to white dwarf stars or the contribution of the cosmic microwave background to cosmic evolution , one uses an energy operator of the generic form @xmath777 , and then by hand discards the @xmath778 term . and then , after all this is done , the finite part of @xmath779 or of the vacuum @xmath780 still has an uncanceled and as yet uncontrolled cosmological constant contribution that still needs to be dealt with .",
    "the present author is not aware of any formal derivation of ( [ m168 ] ) starting from a consistent quantum gravity theory , ) would correspond to a path integration over the matter fields and a stationary variation on the metric .",
    "however , when one performs the path integration over all the other metric paths one finds that the path integral does not actually exist , with there being infinities not just in the vacuum zero - point sector but in scattering amplitudes as well .",

    "absent any such justification , it is not clear whether there is actually any significance in trying to make sense of the implications of ( [ m168 ] ) in the first place .    despite this note of caution , since a justification for ( [ m168 ] ) might still emerge , ) taken as a given , it does have a lot of success in fitting data , though to do so it requires a large amount of so - far undetected dark matter , and an even larger amount of so - far not understood dark energy . ]",
    "it is nonetheless of interest to try to make sense of ( [ m167 ] ) and ( [ m168 ] ) .",
    "of particular interest is the approach based on supersymmetry since it does lead to testable predictions .",
    "the basic idea behind supersymmetry is the existence of a symmetry between bosons and fermions that is exact at the level of the lagrangian and only broken dynamically . for gravity the utility of such a symmetry",
    "is quite extensive , as it addresses the vacuum energy density and cosmological constant problems , provides potential dark matter candidates , admits of a local supergravity extension , and is central to the construction of the string - theory based approach to quantum gravity .",
    "also , and of particular interest to us here , it addresses the elementary higgs field self - energy problem ( the hierarchy problem  so - called since a hierarchy of mass scales is involved ) , in which radiative corrections to the higgs self - energy would , if not controlled in some way , lead to a higgs boson mass at the planck mass regulator mass scale rather than at the 125 gev scale that it has now been found to have .    with the key difference between boson and fermion loops being an overall minus sign due to their differing permutation symmetry statistics , such loops can potentially cancel each others infinities .",
    "thus for the fermion contribution to the vacuum zero - point energy density given in ( [ m146 ] ) , a cancellation of the mass - independent quartic divergence is immediately provided by a boson loop , with the mass - dependent quadratic and logarithmic divergences being canceled as well if the fermions and bosons are degenerate in mass , i.e. if the supersymmetry is exact .",
    "as regards the cosmological constant , it is actually zero if the supersymmetry is exact .",
    "specifically , in a supersymmetric theory one has a generic anticommutator of the form @xmath781 , where the @xmath782 are grassmann supercharges and @xmath783 is the hamiltonian . if the supercharges annihilate @xmath112 ( viz .",
    "unbroken supersymmetry ) , then @xmath784 is zero , the energy of the vacuum is zero , and the cosmological constant is thus zero too .",
    "finally , in the event of an exact supersymmetry , the boson and fermion loop contributions to the mass - dependent quadratic divergence in the self - energy of an elementary higgs field also cancel each other identically , as used in ( [ m67 ] ) in the njl model . ] to thereby provide a candidate solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "attractive as these cancellations are , they do not survive once the supersymmetry is broken and counterpart fermions and bosons stop being degenerate in mass .",
    "moreover , actual experimental detection of any of the required superpartners of the standard fermions and bosons has so far proven elusive . now until quite recently one could account for such lack of detection by breaking the mass degeneracy between ordinary particles and their superpartners , and endowing the superpartners with ever higher masses or ever weaker couplings to ordinary matter . however , in so doing the degree of lack of cancellation of infinities would become greater and greater , as would the size of the cosmological constant term that would then be generated by the loss of of unbroken supersymmetry , with such lack of detection to date of any superparticles leading to a cosmological constant term that would be at least 60 or so orders of magnitude larger than the standard gravity ( [ m168 ] ) could possibly tolerate . however , in order to cancel the quadratic self - energy divergence that an elementary higgs field would have , one would need a supersymmetric particle with a mass reasonably close to that of the higgs boson itself . and",
    "with the higgs boson mass now having been determined , one should thus anticipate finding a superparticle in the same 125 gev mass region , with the cancellation not being able to succeed if the requisite superparticle mass is made too large .",
    "however , no evidence for any such particle has emerged in an exploration of this mass region at the lhc , or in decays such as @xmath785 that were thought to be particularly favorable for supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "not only was no evidence for supersymmetry found in the original lhc run 1 at a beam center of mass energy of 7 to 8 tev , at the even higher energies in the subsequent current lhc run 2 at a beam center of mass energy of 13 tev , and with a far more extensive search of possible relevant channels , no sign of any superparticles up to masses quite significantly above 125 gev was found at all .",
    "the lack of detection of any superparticles in the currently available energy region thus poses a challenge to supersymmetry not just in general but to its proposed solution to the hierarchy problem in particular . and",
    "while the superparticle search at the lhc is still ongoing , and while the so far unsuccessful accompanying underground searches for supersymmetric dark matter candidates are continuing , nonetheless the situation is disquieting enough that one should at least contemplate whether it might be possible to dispense with supersymmetry altogether .",
    "however , since we have seen that supersymmetry does control infinities very well as long as it remains unbroken , in any alternate approach we should again look for some underlying symmetry to control infinities .",
    "thus given the role that conformal invariance played in our treatment above of dynamical higgs boson generation in a critical scaling qed coupled to a four - fermion interaction , we are thus motivated to consider conformal invariance as that requisite symmetry .",
    "on extending conformal symmetry to the gravity sector , we are thus led to consideration of conformal gravity , and as we shall see , it will not only enable us to control infinities when the symmetry is unbroken , it will continue to be able to control them when the symmetry is broken dynamically . moreover , if the higgs boson is generated dynamically , there would then be no hierarchy problem to begin with , as it is only an elementary higgs field that would have a quadratically divergent self - energy problem in the first place .      in 1918 while working on a possible metrication ( geometrization ) of electromagnetism @xcite weyl discovered a tensor , the weyl or conformal tensor @xcite @xmath786 that has the remarkable property that under local conformal transformations of the form @xmath761 with spacetime dependent @xmath80 , the weyl tensor transforms as @xmath787 with all derivatives of @xmath80 being found to drop out identically .",
    "as such , the weyl tensor @xmath788 bears the same relation to local conformal transformations as the maxwell tensor @xmath789 does to local gauge transformations , with the kinematic relation @xmath790 having as a counterpart the kinematic @xmath791 , with the weyl tensor being the traceless piece of the riemann tensor .",
    "conformal gravity is the unique pure metric theory of gravity in four spacetime dimensions that possesses this local conformal symmetry , with the pure gravitational sector of the theory being given by the action ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath792 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -2\\alpha_g\\int d^4x ( -g)^{1/2}\\left[r_{\\mu\\kappa}r^{\\mu\\kappa}-\\frac{1}{3 } ( r^{\\alpha}_{\\phantom{\\alpha}\\alpha})^2\\right ] , \\label{m171}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath793 is a dimensionless gravitational coupling constant , and where the last equality follows since the quantity @xmath794 $ ] is a total divergence ( the gauss - bonnet theorem ) .",

    "moreover , when we do excite positive energy modes out of the vacuum we will generate a new cosmological constant contribution , and it is this term that is measured in cosmology .",
    "cosmology thus only sees the change in the vacuum energy density due to adding in positive energy modes and does not see the full negative energy mode vacuum energy density itself , i.e. in ( [ m184 ] ) one is sensitive not to @xmath882 , and not even to @xmath883 , but only to their difference @xmath884 .",
    "also gravity sees this effect mode by mode , i.e. gravity mode by fermion mode .",
    "thus , for instance , in the application of @xmath885 of ( [ m163 ] ) to cosmology that was described in @xcite , the quantity @xmath750 is not @xmath886 but the much smaller @xmath887 .",

    "we had noted earlier that conformal invariance excludes the einstein - hilbert action .",

    "the variation @xmath807 of @xmath795 as given in ( [ m172 ] ) thus only depends on the ricci tensor and ricci scalar and their derivatives , and all the terms in @xmath807 vanish identically if @xmath890 vanishes identically .",
    "] moreover , to recover the successful results of a given theory one does not need to recover its equations , one only needs to recover its solutions , and one actually only needs to recover them in the kinematic region where they have been tested .",
    "however , while the schwarzschild solution is a solution to conformal gravity , there are other solutions since the vanishing of @xmath807 can be achieved without the vanishing of the ricci tensor itself .",
    "to determine what these other solutions might look like , mannheim and kazanas studied the geometry associated with a static , spherically symmetric source in the conformal gravity theory , to find @xcite that the coefficient @xmath891 obeyed the exact , all - order classical fourth - order poisson equation @xmath892 the general solution to this equation is given by @xmath893 where @xmath894 obeys @xmath895 .",
    "since the integration in ( [ m186 ] ) extends all the way to @xmath896 , the @xmath897 potential receives contributions from material both inside and outside any system of interest . according to ( [ m186 ] ) , matter confined to the interior of a star of radius @xmath898 produces a potential exterior to the star of the form @xmath899 per unit solar mass of star .",

    "we thus recover the standard model solution but do not recover its equations , with einstein gravity only being sufficient to give the schwarzschild solution and newton s law of gravity but not necessary .",
    "] however , we find that the potential gets modified at large distances where @xmath901 $ ] , so that the solution recovers the newton potential at short distances only , with the non - ricci - flat solutions to conformal gravity only modifying the ricci - flat one at large distances and not at small ones .",
    "we thus recover the solution to einstein gravity in the kinematic solar system region where it has been tested with the use of known luminous sources alone , while for an appropriate galactic - determined value for @xmath902 , the solution will depart from newton on precisely those galactic distances where in standard gravity one first has to resort to dark matter .",
    "specifically , for galaxies , integrating the @xmath903 potential over a thin disk of stars with a surface brightness @xmath904 with scale length @xmath905 ( the typical configuration for the stars in a spiral galaxy ) yields the net local potential produced by the stars in the galaxy itself , and leads to a locally generated contribution to galactic circular velocities of the form @xcite @xmath906 } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{n^*\\gamma^ * c^2r^2}{2r_0}i_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) k_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) , \\label{m187}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath907 is the number of stars in the galaxy .",
    "there are two contributions due to material outside the galaxy , i.e. due to the rest of the universe .",

    "the second arises from the integral from @xmath620 to @xmath909 term in ( [ m186 ] ) due to cosmological inhomogeneities such as clusters of galaxies , and is of a quadratic potential form with coefficient @xmath910 @xcite .",
    "since both of these external contributions come from the universe as a whole , they are both independent of any particular galaxy of interest , and thus act universally on every galaxy , with every galaxy seeing the same @xmath911-dependent and @xmath910-dependent potentials .",
    "when all these internal and external contributions are combined , the total rotational velocities in galaxies are given by @xmath912     +   +   +   +   +   +    when the present author first studied rotation velocity curves in the conformal gravity theory , the data that were available did not go out far enough in distance for the @xmath913 term to be significant , with the @xmath914 formula providing a very good fit ( see e.g. @xcite ) to an available 11 galaxy sample without the need for any dark matter .",
    "however , with 141 spiral galaxies now being available and with 21 of them going out far enough in distance to be sensitive to the @xmath913 term , mannheim and obrien @xcite applied the full @xmath915 formula to the set of 141 rotation curves , and found very good fitting with parameters @xmath916 with no dark matter being needed . with @xmath917 being found to be of order @xmath918 cm , we see that the effect of the linear @xmath902 potential does indeed only become significant on galactic distance scales , as do the @xmath911 and @xmath910 terms also .",

    "just two years after einstein metricated gravity with his development of general relativity , weyl @xcite attempted to metricate electromagnetism by proposing that the standard riemannian geometry levi - civita connection @xmath930 be augmented with a second connection , the weyl connection @xmath931 that expressly depended on the electromagnetic potential @xmath678 , to thus put @xmath678 into the geometry . with this augmentation , the generalized connection @xmath932 has the remarkable property of being left invariant under a joint local transformation on the metric and the electromagnetic potential of the form @xmath933 for any spacetime - dependent @xmath934 .",
    "consequently , a generalized riemann tensor or a generalized weyl tensor built out of this generalized connection would be invariant under ( [ m194 ] ) also .",
    "however , with the covariant derivative of the metric associated with this generalized connection being the non - zero @xmath935 , parallel transport is then path ( and thus history ) dependent , with the theory thus being untenable .",
    "much later it was realized that the theory had another drawback .",
    "when @xmath936 is inserted into the generalized dirac action @xmath937 where @xmath938(v^b_{\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}v^{a\\nu}+v^b_{\\lambda}\\tilde{\\gamma}^{\\lambda}_{\\phantom{\\lambda}\\nu\\mu}v^{a\\nu})$ ] is constructed with the generalized @xmath939 connection given in ( [ m193 ] ) , the weyl connection is found to drop out identically @xcite .",
    "thus the weyl connection never could have provided a geometric description of electromagnetism in the first place .    to rectify this",
    ", we note that the weyl prescription for constructing @xmath940 is to replace the @xmath941 factor in @xmath942 by @xmath943 .",
    "however , we recall that to obtain the standard minimal electromagnetic gauge coupling we must use not @xmath944 but @xmath945 , with the factor of @xmath226 actually being required because of hermiticity or @xmath816 invariance .",
    "thus it is suggested @xcite to proceed analogously with the weyl connection by replacing @xmath936 by @xmath946 then , on using the generalized connection @xmath947 in a generalized spin connection @xmath948 that is determined from it , following some algebra we find that the generalized dirac action takes none other than the form @xcite @xmath949 with the action given in ( [ m198 ] ) being the standard one that is obtained by standard local electromagnetic gauge invariance ( viz .",

    "the @xmath952 action thus has a dual characterization  it can be generated via local gauge invariance or via a generalized geometric connection .",
    "the two viewpoints are equivalent .    as constructed , the action @xmath952 is not just locally gauge invariant , it is locally conformal invariant too , as it is left invariant under @xmath953 however , comparing with ( [ m194 ] ) , we see that in ( [ m199 ] ) , this time @xmath954 is not to transform at all . in consequence",
    ", neither a generalized riemann tensor or a generalized weyl tensor built out of the connection given in ( [ m197 ] ) would be invariant under ( [ m199 ] ) .",
    "moreover , neither would the standard riemann tensor as constructed via the standard levi - civita connection alone be invariant either",
    ". however , the conformal weyl tensor as constructed in ( [ m169 ] ) via the standard levi - civita connection alone would be locally conformal invariant under ( [ m199 ] ) . consequently , given the local conformal invariance that the dirac action possesses , the only action that we could write down in the pure gravity sector that would have this invariance too would be the @xmath795 action given in ( [ m171 ] ) .",
    "we are thus naturally led to conformal gravity . and",
    "since conformal gravity is based on a strictly riemannian geometry with the standard levi - civita connection , there is no parallel transport problem , any more than there would have been if we had introduced @xmath678 into the dirac action and obtained ( [ m198 ] ) by local electromagnetic gauge invariance in a theory with a levi - civita based @xmath955 .",
    "if ( [ m198 ] ) is associated with a strictly riemannian geometry when @xmath678 is introduced via local electromagnetic gauge invariance , it must equally be associated with a strictly riemannian geometry when @xmath678 is introduced via the generalized connection given in ( [ m197 ] ) .",
    "invariance under ( [ m199 ] ) thus forces the gravity sector to be strictly riemannian , and there is no parallel transport problem .",
    "the local conformal structure of @xmath952 thus prevents @xmath956 with its otherwise seemingly problematic factor of @xmath226 from coupling in the gravity sector , to thereby render the gravity sector real .",
    "and , with there being no parallel transport problem , even with its non - zero @xmath956 , the theory is viable .      to generalize metrication to incorporate axial symmetry ,",
    "we allow for torsion and introduce the antisymmetric cartan torsion tensor @xmath957 and the associated contorsion @xmath958 according to @xmath959 then with @xmath960 insertion of @xmath961 into @xmath962 is found @xcite to change @xmath952 of ( [ m198 ] ) into @xmath963 this action is invariant under @xmath964\\psi(x)$ ] , @xmath965 , with local axial symmetry thus being metricated too .",
    "the action is also invariant under local conformal transformations as well , if , just like @xmath954 , @xmath966 does not transform under a local conformal transformation at all ( viz .",
    "@xmath967 ) .",
    "it is our view that rather than being something arcane , torsion manifests itself as an axial gauge boson , one that would then have escaped detection if it acquires a large enough higgs mechanism mass .",
    "thus if we seek a metrication of the fundamental forces through the weyl and torsion connections , we are led to a quite far reaching conclusion : not only must the fundamental forces be described by local gauge theories , they must be described by spontaneously broken ones .",
    "the extension to the non - abelian case is also direct .",

    ", the action @xmath979 is quite remarkable , as it not only possesses some of the key local invariances in physics , viz .",
    "general coordinate invariance , local lorentz invariance , local vector non - abelian gauge symmetry , local axial - vector non - abelian gauge symmetry , and local conformal symmetry , every one of these invariances can have a geometric origin .",
    "when the fermion spin connection @xmath753 was first introduced into physics , its purpose was to implement local lorentz invariance , since while @xmath980 was invariant under global lorentz transformations on @xmath410 of the form @xmath981 with a spacetime - independent @xmath982 , on its own @xmath980 was not invariant under local ones in which @xmath982 depended on the spacetime coordinates .",
    "however , @xmath983 is .",
    "now while it was not intended , the standard curved space massless dirac action @xmath984 with a levi - civita based spin connection just happens to be invariant under the local conformal transformations given in ( [ m199 ] ) .",
    "is invariant under the global @xmath985 , as the change of variable @xmath986 reveals .",
    "the spin connection is then needed when @xmath635 is taken to depend on the spacetime coordinates . ]",
    "thus , as we see , we are essentially getting local conformal invariance for free , without needing to ask for it a priori .",
    "moreover , we can interpret @xmath753 as the gauge field of local conformal invariance in exactly the same way as @xmath954 acts as the gauge field of local gauge invariance , with both the real and the imaginary parts of the @xmath987 phase of the fermion being gauged . now",
    "while the conformal invariance of the massless dirac action would be lost if the fermion were to be massive , in order to maintain conformal invariance at the level of the lagrangian we would need mass to be induced dynamically , precisely just as we have been considering in this article . with the same analysis holding for all of the fundamental strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions since they are all based on local gauge theories with dimensionless coupling constants , they would all be fully conformal invariant at the level of the lagrangian if all masses are induced dynamically .",
    "we thus see that if there are no fundamental mass terms at all and if all mass is to come from vacuum breaking , conformal invariance is a quite natural invariance for physics .",
    "theory of electroweak interactions , there is just one fundamental mass scale in the lagrangian , namely that associated with the @xmath988 term in the lagrangian of an elementary higgs field . in a critical scaling theory with a dynamical higgs field",
    ", such non - conformal - invariant terms do not appear in the fundamental lagrangian . ] in this way we see an intimate connection between conformal symmetry and dynamical mass generation .",
    "further support for the relevance of conformal gravity may be found by doing a fermionic path integration of the dirac action given in ( [ m204 ] ) .",

    "on doing the fermion path integration we generate an effective action @xmath333 whose leading term is of the form @xmath990 + \\frac{1}{3}g_{\\mu\\nu}^ig^{\\mu\\nu}_i+\\frac{1}{3}s_{\\mu\\nu}^is^{\\mu\\nu}_i\\bigg { ] } , \\label{m205}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath817 is a log divergent constant , and @xmath991 and @xmath992 are the standard non - abelian antisymmetric rank two tensors associated with @xmath993 and @xmath994.-dependent and @xmath993-dependent components of @xmath333 and the value of the constant @xmath817 may be found in @xcite and the @xmath994-dependent component may be found in @xcite . ]",
    "we recognize the terms in ( [ m205 ] ) as respectively being of the form of none other than the bosonic @xmath995 , @xmath993 , and @xmath994 sectors of the conformal gravity , vector yang - mills , and axial - vector yang - mills theories .",
    "that @xmath333 must have the form that it has is because it must possess all the local symmetries that @xmath979 itself possesses . as we see",
    ", the @xmath942 , @xmath956 , and @xmath996 contributions to the generalized @xmath948 lead to three distinct and independent sectors in ( [ m205 ] ) , and despite the presence of non - abelian terms in @xmath948 , the resulting conformal gravitational sector expressly has no internal symmetry dependence , just as one would want .",
    "thus save only for the gravity sector , we recognize ( [ m204 ] ) and ( [ m205 ] ) as the standard action used in fundamental physics , only now all generated geometrically .",

    "on dressing the point fermion loop diagrams with photon exchange dressings ( i.e. on additionally doing a path integration of @xmath1007 over @xmath678 ) , we see that if we have critical scaling and @xmath471 , ( [ m206 ] ) will be dressed into ( [ m107 ] ) , as appropriately generalized .",
    "thus if mass is generated by a mean - field procedure in which there is a four - fermion interaction , the mean field will precisely have the form given in ( [ m206 ] ) , as then dressed by a critical scaling that makes the four - fermion interaction be both renormalizable and conformal invariant .",
    "below we discuss the four - fermion interaction terms in more detail .    the very fact that fermion path integration generated the conformal gravity action in ( [ m205 ] )",
    "reinforces the result of @xcite that conformal gravity is ghost free and unitary .",
    "specifically , since the relevant fermion path integration is equivalent to a one loop feynman diagram , and since one can not change the structure of a hilbert space in perturbation theory , it must be the case that either @xmath979 and @xmath333 both have states of negative norm or neither does .",
    "but the @xmath979 action is the standard fermion sector action that is used in particle physics all the time , and it is completely free of states with negative norm .",
    "thus conformal gravity must be free of negative norm states also , and must thus be as consistent at the quantum level as the @xmath979 action from which it can be derived .      since there is a log divergence in ( [ m205 ] ) , and since ( [ m205 ] ) is obtained via a fermion loop radiative correction , we can cancel the divergence by a counterterm . to do",
    "so we augment the dirac action @xmath979 with a fundamental yang - mills gauge field ( @xmath1008 ) action and a conformal ( @xmath795 ) metric sector action of the form @xmath1009}. \\label{m207}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even while this action will now take care of the infinities in ( [ m205 ] ) and its higher order radiative corrections , there will still be uncanceled vacuum energy density contributions . to cancel them we introduce an @xmath968 invariant four - fermion action with coupling @xmath1010 , viz .",
    "@xmath1011 } , \\label{m208}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can thus we write down a fundamental action for a conformal invariant universe , viz .",
    "@xmath1012 if the dynamics associated with ( [ m209 ] ) leads to an @xmath1013 with dynamical dimension equal to four , the @xmath1014 action will then provide a fully conformal invariant , renormalizable , and consistent action for the universe in which all mass is generated in the vacuum by dynamical symmetry breaking , with all bound states being generated by the residual interaction associated with @xmath1013 .",
    "as regards the four - fermion @xmath1013 term , we note that it makes the vacuum energy density finite when @xmath1015 , and in so doing makes the four - fermion interaction contribution to the @xmath368 and @xmath366 scattering amplitudes be finite too .",
    "however there are also gauge boson and graviton contributions to scattering amplitudes , and the contributions that they make via @xmath1016 are also all renormalizable . moreover , if the beta functions associated with all three of the conformal gravity , vector yang - mills , and axial - vector yang - mills actions all vanish , and if all the associated non - abelian @xmath1017 are all equal to minus one , not only would the full @xmath1014 theory be renormalizable , the theory would even be finite and exist without renormalization @xcite [ just as the schwinger - dyson equation and the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitudes ( cf .",
    "( [ m73 ] ) , ( [ m117 ] ) , ( [ m126 ] ) ) exist without renormalization in the abelian case ] .",
    "thus for weak interactions we make the four - fermion interaction model of weak interactions renormalizable by replacing it by a gauge theory whose gauge bosons become massive through the higgs mechanism , and in the presence of gravity we make the vacuum energy density finite by introducing an @xmath1013 four - fermion interaction that is made renormalizable by anomalous dimensions .",
    "there are thus two ways to control the divergences of four - fermion interactions , either replace them by a gauge theory or soften them via anomalous dimensions , and both play a role in physics . given its content",
    ", we can identify ( [ m209 ] ) as a candidate theory of everything , one that is potentially finite , and one that is formulated in the four spacetime dimensions for which there is evidence .",
    "it is of interest to compare conformal symmetry and supersymmetry , as they both seek to address many of the same issues . in order to compare them , we note first that unlike supersymmetry , conformal symmetry does not need to be postulated . if we start with fermions alone and couple them to curved space via the requirement of local lorentz invariance , we will directly be led to the @xmath983 action . as noted above",
    ", this action is not just locally lorentz invariant but is locally conformal invariant too .",
    "however , it is not in any way supersymmetric .",
    "thus for the @xmath983 action local conformal invariance is output not input ( as is then the conformal gravity action generated in ( [ m205 ] ) by fermion path integration ) , and thus never needs to be postulated .",
    "however one can not get from @xmath983 to a supersymmetric action without postulating the existence of bosonic superpartners of the fermions .",
    "the reason why it is fermions and conformal symmetry rather than fermions , bosons and supersymmetry that is singled out is that the 15-dimensional @xmath1018 conformal group is the full symmetry of the light cone on which all particles move in the absence of mass .",
    "and with the 15-dimensional @xmath1019 being the covering group of the conformal group , the fundamental representation of the conformal group is the four - component spinor , all on its own with no bosonic superpartner being needed .",
    "moreover , if all mass scales are to be generated dynamically , there must be an underlying conformal symmetry in the fundamental action , with it only being broken in the vacuum .    in terms of",
    "what conformal symmetry and supersymmetry aspire to do , we note that both theories seek to address the vacuum energy density problem , the cosmological constant problem , the higgs self - energy problem , the dark matter problem , and the quantum gravity problem . while supersymmetry can address the first three of these problems when it is unbroken , as we had noted above , it runs into difficulty once the supersymmetry is broken .",
    "while supersymmetry can provide possible dark matter candidates , it is not yet able to derive a formula such as the observationally - tested conformal gravity formula given in ( [ m188 ] ) for galactic rotation curves , or provide a formula that requires no fine tuning for the hubble plot such as the conformal gravity one given in ( [ m190 ] ) . and as to quantum gravity , to construct a consistent string theory of quantum gravity , one needs not just supersymmetry , one in addition needs six extra spacetime dimensions .",
    "and then beyond all this , superparticles of course need to found , and yet to date there is no sign of any of them , either at the lhc or in underground dark matter searches .",
    "as we have seen in this article , for every one of these five major problems conformal symmetry appears to be doing better than supersymmetry , primarily because it is able to retain control of these problems even after the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken . through conformal symmetry one is able to resolve these problems without the need for any dark matter , any dark energy , or any fine tuning of parameters .",
    "in addition , through conformal symmetry one can construct a consistent , unitary , and renormalizable theory of quantum gravity without any new particles or any extra spacetime dimensions .",
    "and one can do so while making some readily testable predictions such as the extension of ( [ m188 ] ) and ( [ m190 ] ) beyond the domains in which they have currently been tested .",
    "determining whether the higgs boson is elementary or dynamical could go a long way to establishing whether it is supersymmetry ( as needed for the self - energy hierarchy problem of an elementary higgs boson ) or conformal symmetry ( critical scaling , anomalous dimensions , and a dynamically generated higgs boson with no hierarchy problem ) that might be favored .",
    "in this article we have addressed the question of whether the higgs boson is elementary or composite . even though the standard elementary higgs boson electroweak model works extremely well , there are nonetheless some basic concerns with the model : ( i ) radiative corrections to the higgs self - energy have a high scale hierarchy problem , ( ii ) there is an enormous number of free parameters in the coupling of the higgs boson to the quarks and leptons , ( iii ) in its spontaneously broken phase the higgs potential provides a large contribution to the cosmological constant , ( iv ) as with any quantum field theory there is a zero - point problem , though this only becomes of concern when the theory is coupled to gravity , as it ultimately must be , and ( v ) the whole notion of an elementary higgs boson stands in sharp contrast to the bcs theory of superconductivity or the generation of a goldstone boson pion in strong interactions since neither of these two well - established cases involves any elementary higgs boson at all , with the breaking being done dynamically by fermion bilinear condensates . as we have shown , all of these concerns can be addressed if the symmetry breaking is dynamical : ( i ) a bound state higgs boson has no hierarchy problem , ( ii ) when the higgs boson is a bound state , the same dynamics that fixes its mass as the position of the pole in a fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude also fixes its coupling to the fermions as the residue at the pole , ( iii , iv ) when the higgs generation mechanism involves the four - fermion interaction then on coupling to conformal gravity one can resolve both the cosmological constant problem and the zero - point problem , and ( v ) with a dynamical higgs boson electroweak and strong interaction symmetry breaking are treated equivalently .",
    "with the vacuum of quantum field theory being a dynamical one , in a sense einstein s ether has reemerged . only it has reemerged not as the mechanical ether of classical physics that was excluded by the michelson - morley experiment , but as a dynamical , quantum - field - theoretic one full of dirac s negative energy particles , an infinite number of such particles whose dynamics can spontaneously break symmetries .",
    "the type of physics that would be taking place in this vacuum depends on how symmetries are broken , i.e. on whether the breaking is by elementary higgs fields or by dynamical composites .",
    "if the symmetry is broken by an elementary higgs field , then the higgs boson gives mass to fundamental gauge bosons and fermions alike .",
    "however , if the breaking is done dynamically , then it is the structure of an ordered vacuum itself that generates masses , with the mass generation mechanism in turn then producing the higgs boson . in the dynamical case",
    "then mass produces higgs rather than higgs produces mass . in the dynamical case we should not be thinking of the higgs boson as being the  god particle \" .",
    "rather , if anything , we should be thinking of the vacuum as being the  god vacuum \" .",
