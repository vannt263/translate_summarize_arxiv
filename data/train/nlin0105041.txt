    "optical materials with @xmath0 nonlinearity offer many advantages as candidates for all - optical processing applications .",
    "for example , they offer a fast and strong nonlinear response , and through cascading @xmath1 processes @xcite , they can support stable localized solitary - wave solutions in more than one dimension @xcite , in contrast with systems that have only a cubic nonlinear response .",
    "experimental studies have confirmed the existence of one-@xcite and two - dimensional@xcite spatial and spatio - temporal@xcite quadratic solitons and have demonstrated that they act as dynamically reconfigurable guiding structures@xcite , with switching behavior controllable through phase-@xcite and intensity - dependent@xcite effects .",
    "even though special ` dark - vortex ' solitons have been generated in quadratic media@xcite , coherent dark solitons are generally unstable in homogeneous materials with only quadratic nonlinearity , due to a modulational instability ( mi ) in the background plane wave .    like solitons , mi occurs due to an interplay between nonlinear and dispersive or diffractive effects . in nonlinear optics",
    ", it appears as a transverse instability that breaks up a broad optical beam@xcite , thereby acting as a precursor for the formation of stable bright spatial solitons , as has been confirmed experimentally@xcite .",
    "conversely , the stable propagation of dark solitons relies on the stability of the constant - intensity background and thus requires the absence of mi .",
    "the mismatch@xcite and intensity@xcite dependence of the instability period has been investigated experimentally , as has the intensity and frequency dependence of the gain@xcite .    in all @xmath0 materials , there is of course an inherent cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity .",
    "the combined nonlinearities lead to novel effects , such as the existence of bright solitons in an intrinsically defocusing cubic medium@xcite .",
    "also , if the defocusing cubic nonlinearity is sufficiently strong , it may eliminate mi @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the cubic nonlinearity in conventional @xmath0 materials is usually focusing and thus of the wrong type for these effects to occur .",
    "however a cubic nonlinearity of a different kind may be induced through long - period variations in the linear or nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "such periodicities are used for quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) , which compensates the material mismatch between the fundamental and second - harmonic ( sh ) modes .",
    "the lowest - order effect of qpm is to induce an effectively phase - matched quadratic nonlinearity in the equations for the averaged fields .",
    "to first order , the non - phase - matched oscillatory components of the fields induce cubic nonlinearities@xcite , in the same manner as the non - phase - matched interactions do in the cascading limit@xcite . for certain materials and etching techniques , altering the nonlinear susceptibility also induces a change in the linear susceptibility .",
    "the action of such a simultaneous linear grating can be to reduce the effective quadratic nonlinearity@xcite , making the effective nonlinearity more cubic , as in the cascading limit .    in this paper , we investigate the effects of such periodicities on the mi properties of beams in @xmath0 materials , considerably extending the initial results presented in ref .  .",
    "we provide a comprehensive and comparative treatment of the different approaches ( exact and approximate ) and use a variety of particular cases to illustrate general properties .",
    "section [ system ] introduces the system studied in the rest of the paper . in analyzing this system ,",
    "we first ( sec .",
    "[ average_solns ] ) seek modulationally stable dark solitons in an approximate _ averaged _ system .",
    "previous work@xcite has confirmed the accuracy of the averaged theory in describing the average properties of solitons and cw switching@xcite , showing that this intrinsically quadratically nonlinear system behaves as though it were governed by cubic as well as quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "the theory also describes space - varying behavior , but to a lower accuracy .",
    "we discover that the cubic terms that result from particular gratings can be large enough and of the correct sign to prevent mi .",
    "the second part of this work compares the stability predictions of the averaged theory with those of exact calculations .",
    "the exact methods involve finding the exact periodic plane - wave solutions in the full ( nonaveraged ) system , with the higher harmonics included to all orders ( sec .",
    "[ floquet_solns ] ) .",
    "we apply a floquet analysis to these periodic solutions to determine the growth rate of linear perturbations ( sec .",
    "[ floquet_mi ] ) , which can now be directly probed in experiments@xcite .",
    "additionally , we directly simulate the periodic - field equations ( sec .",
    "[ propagative ] ) , using for initial conditions the averaged solutions seeded with noise .",
    "according to the exact calculations , the periodicities can drastically alter the mi gain spectrum , but they do not entirely remove the inherent instability . in the regime of efficient qpm , we find that the mi gain spectrum contains two distinct and well - separated features with fundamentally different physical origins ( see sec .",
    "[ appi ] ) .",
    "the low - frequency part of the gain is accurately predicted by the averaged theory and disappears for certain grating modulations .",
    "the high - frequency part of the spectrum is related to the inherent gain of the non - phase - matched material ( i.e. , with no gratings ) and appears to be unavoidable .",
    "however , because they are consistently small , the high - frequency peaks can be ignored under a less stringent definition of _ experimental _ stability ( see sec .  [ exp ] ) .",
    "this gives the possibility of stable plane waves as predicted by the averaged theory .",
    "we consider a cw beam ( carrier frequency @xmath2 ) interacting with its second harmonic ( sh ) , both propagating in a lossless 1d slab waveguide under conditions for type i second - harmonic generation ( shg ) .",
    "both the linear and quadratic nonlinear susceptibilities are periodic along the @xmath3-direction of propagation but are constant along the transverse @xmath4-direction .",
    "we assume a weak modulation of the refractive index ( @xmath5@xmath61 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 refers to the frequency @xmath9 ) .",
    "we consider gratings for forward qpm only .",
    "the grating period is then much longer than the optical period , in which case bragg reflections can be neglected .",
    "the evolution of the slowly varying beam envelopes is then described by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11=@xmath12 and @xmath13=@xmath14 are the envelope functions of the fundamental and sh , respectively .",

    "we choose to retain @xmath40 explicitly , however , to show the connection with the standard normalization .    to find solutions in this periodic system , we fourier - expand the rescaled gratings , @xmath50=@xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and where @xmath55 for @xmath56 odd and @xmath57 for @xmath56 even .",
    "we include @xmath58 in the fourier expansions to ensure that the expansions give the same physical grating form for both signs of @xmath59 .",
    "plane waves in system ( [ field_eqns ] ) and ( [ planewave2 ] ) have an intensity that is constant in the transverse direction but periodic in @xmath3 , driven by the periodic variation of the susceptibilities .",
    "thus they have the same spatial frequency @xmath59 as the gratings , and we expand them in fourier series also : @xmath60 an accurate treatment of the problem requires that all fourier components ( up to some cutoff ) be included .",

    "[ floquet_solns ] .",
    "however we first present an approximate theory for the dc components @xmath61 , which suffices for many calculations .",

    "furthermore , efficient phase matching is assumed , with the domain length being close to the coherence length , @xmath71 , so the residual mismatch is small , @xmath72 .",
    "to first order ( @xmath73 ) , this gives the harmonics @xmath74 where @xmath75 is kronecker s delta and where we have assumed that the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 vary slowly in @xmath78 compared to @xmath79 . using these solutions",
    ", we obtain to first order the averaged equations for the dc components @xmath61 : @xmath80 these equations also describe @xmath81th order qpm ( where @xmath82 is ideally zero ) and any other type of long - period grating .",
    "incorporating time or the spatial @xmath83 coordinate is also straightforward .",
    "the effective quadratic ( @xmath84 ) and induced cubic ( @xmath85 ) nonlinearities are simply given by sums over the fourier coefficients@xcite , and for the square grating ( [ fourgrating ] ) are @xmath86 and @xmath87/\\kappa$ ] .    from eqs .",
    "( [ average_eqns ] ) follows the important result that cubic nonlinearities are induced by the nonlinear qpm gratings .",
    "this cubic nonlinearity has the form of asymmetric self- and cross - phase modulations ( spm and xpm ) and is a result of non - phase - matched coupling between the wave at the main spatial frequency @xmath59 and its higher harmonics .",
    "it is thus of a fundamentally different nature than the material kerr nonlinearity , a fact which is reflected in the the spm being absent for the sh .",

    "this is not surprising , because these points lie outside the stability region predicted by the first - order analysis . but exact solutions corresponding to the stable lowest branch of averaged solutions can be found for lower values of @xmath224 , the grating wave number . a plot of the maximum mi gain ( [ pl_stab](a ) ) , however , shows that these solutions exhibit a weak , but nonzero mi gain .",
    "this residual gain ( @xmath225 ) increases for decreasing @xmath59 and is caused by narrow gain bands that are once again present at high @xmath141 .",
    "other simulations also confirm that such high-@xmath141 peaks , which are not predicted by the averaged theory , are a general feature of the gain spectrum for efficient qpm gratings .",
    "to analyze the mi spectrum in detail and illustrate the physical origin of these high-@xmath141 peaks , we consider the spectra of two concrete examples that are typical for efficiently phase - matched gratings ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "figure [ gain_4](a ) is the spectrum for a conventional domain - reversal grating in linbo@xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) for @xmath48=@xmath229 , @xmath59= 100 and exact phase matching ( @xmath96=@xmath230 ) , and fig .",

    "the former is unstable according to the averaged - field analysis and possesses a low-@xmath141 gain that is accurately predicted by the average theory ( fig .",
    "[ gain_4](c ) ) ; the latter lies in the predicted stable region and thus has no gain at low @xmath141 .    the high-@xmath141 gain bands are related to the inherent mi in the non - phase - matched , homogeneous @xmath0 material ( i.e. with no grating ) , as demonstrated by the close match between the homogeneous gain band ( fig .  [ gain_4](d ) ) and one of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ gain_4](b ) . in general ,",
    "each gain peak that appears in the homogeneous spectrum usually also appears in the floquet spectrum , typically with the same height and spectral location .",
    "often , as in fig .",

    "[ average_mi ] , attempting to reach the stable branch of the approximate solutions while maintaining a large quadratic nonlinearity ( @xmath84 ) usually involves the poor - phase - matching regime , where the averaged theory no longer holds . to illustrate what happens ,",

    "[ pl_stab](b ) the maximum growth rate of instabilities for the grating @xmath176 and @xmath234 . here",
    "@xmath235 is rather large and @xmath236 is fairly small , so the first - order perturbation results are not guaranteed to be valid in this region . that the floquet theory found solutions with large gain in the predicted stable region is therefore not surprising .",
    "the differences between the averaged and exact treatments for these parameters are further illustrated by comparison of the gain profiles , which we do in fig .",
    "[ gain_curve2 ] for two representative points .",
    "the averaged solution corresponding to fig .",
    "[ gain_curve2](a ) ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 ) lies in the predicted stable region , but the floquet analysis gives a nonzero gain which is large and broadband . the exact gain curve in figs .",
    "[ gain_curve2](b ) ( @xmath239 , @xmath240 ) consists of a number of narrow peaks distributed over a range of frequencies , whereas the first - order analysis predicts a larger , broadband curve that lies at low frequencies .    in sec .",
    "[ appi ] , where the grating efficiently phase - matches the fields , we saw that the mi gain spectrum falls into two , well - separated parts : the low - frequency bands induced by the periodicity and accurately predicted by the averaged equations , and the high - frequency bands related to inherent @xmath0 gain .",
    "when the residual mismatch @xmath241 is larger ( and not so different from @xmath242 ) , we find that the two regions no longer are well separated and that the averaged equations no longer accurately predict the low-@xmath141 bands . for very poor phase matching as in this section , the two features mix , producing a complicated gain spectrum ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ gain_curve2](b ) ) that can not be simply related to the distinct underlying physical mechanisms .      in all our results",
    ", we found no solutions that , mathematically speaking , were modulationally stable . even in the region where the averaged - field analysis predicts stability",
    ", there is a residual gain corresponding to the high-@xmath141 bands .",
    "however this residual gain is not large ( @xmath243 or smaller for material mismatch @xmath244 or larger ) , and may be neglected under a reasonable definition of _ experimental stability_. if perturbations do not increase by any orders of magnitude within a few diffractions lengths , which is a typical experimental length scale , then the instability will not be detectable .",
    "however if we do neglect these high-@xmath141 bands , so that the averaged and floquet results coincide , then we must also allow some solutions previously classed as unstable by the averaged - field analysis to be classed as stable , because the low-@xmath141 bands are sometimes smaller than the high-@xmath141 bands .",
    "these additional solutions correspond to the light - grey regions in fig .",
    "[ unstable ] for @xmath103 as well as similar regions for @xmath143 and @xmath112 , which were previously regarded as totally unstable branches .",
    "to confirm the floquet predictions of the mi spectra , we perform numerical simulations of the ( scaled ) field equations ( [ planewave2 ] ) . we can determine gain curves by launching plane waves seeded with small fluctuations , which then evolve linearly .",

    "[ gain_curve2 ] , where the averaged and exact predictions markedly disagree .",
    "small , narrow peaks are difficult to distinguish from the noise floor in these simulations , but the peaks seen in the smoothed data in fig .  [ gain_curve2](b ) ( dotted ) clearly correspond to the largest floquet peaks ( solid ) . for the same reason , the small , narrow high-@xmath141 bands predicted by floquet theory are difficult to detect , but with a careful choice of simulation parameters these peaks can be seen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ prop3 ] for the linbo@xmath227 grating .",

    "in summary , we determined the exact structure and modulational stability of plane - wave solutions in periodic @xmath0 materials , using both floquet transfer - matrix calculations and direct numerical simulations . in particular , we found fourier expansions of the plane waves in the propagation direction and used these in calculations of the gain spectrum ( growth rate versus transverse frequency of the instability ) . in the regime of efficient phase matching , we found that , due to the periodicity , the spectra contain gain bands both at low spatial frequency , which are caused by the phase - matching gratings , and at high spatial frequency , which are related to the inherent gain of homogeneous @xmath0 materials . for poor phase - matching",
    ", the gain bands do not fall into these different regions of the spectrum and so can not be respectively attributed to distinct underlying causes .    in the regime of efficient phase matching ,",
    "the exact calculations were supplemented by a simpler averaged - field approach characterized by effective quadratic and induced cubic nonlinearities . for sufficiently large cubic nonlinearities and away from exact phase matching , the averaged - field theory predicts stability for some solutions .",
    "however , the exact techniques showed that whereas the averaged - field approach accurately predicts slowly varying properties of the system , it sometimes inaccurately treats the higher fourier components , as these are treated to a lower order in the theory .",
    "it also shows inaccuracies in the mi predictions , being unable to predict the high - frequency gain bands .",
    "nevertheless , the averaged - field theory accurately describes low - frequency gain , even in the extreme case where the effective quadratic nonlinearity is cancelled by competition between the linear and nonlinear gratings .",
