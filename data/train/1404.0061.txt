    "general capacity achieving encoding strategies for wireless networks are unknown .",
    "two coding strategies , _ noisy network coding _ ( nnc ) @xcite , @xcite and _ short message nnc _ ( snnc ) @xcite have recently been shown to outperform other cooperative strategies for multicast networks ( e.g. , decode - and - forward ( df ) ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "both nnc and snnc are based on compression at relays , first used in compress - and - forward ( cf ) @xcite .",
    "however , in networks with many relays receiving signals of different strengths , constraining all relays to perform the same cooperative scheme may not be optimal .",
    "relays in favorable positions can perform df thereby removing the noise otherwise partially propagated via compression based schemes . on the other hand , decoding requirement at a df relay can severly limit the transmission rate if the links over which the relay is receiving are weak .",
    "it has recently been shown by hou and kramer that _ mixed _ cooperative strategies that allow some relays to perform df while the rest deploy snnc , can _ outperform _ strategies in which all relays use the same relaying scheme ( e.g. , df , cf , nnc or snnc ) @xcite .",
    "nnc and snnc can achieve the same transmission rate @xcite ; the main difference between them is that in snnc , the source sends independent `` short '' messages in each block , whereas in nnc , the same message of _ higher _ encoding rate is repeatedly sent over many blocks .",
    "the lower encoding rate of short messages allows relays which have strong received signals to perform df , while other relays still deploy snnc @xcite , thus enabling the use of mixed strategies .    in this paper",
    ", we present an encoding scheme that improves performance achievable with the mixed cooperative strategies analyzed in @xcite . to motivate our approach , consider a multihop relay network in which all relays use df , shown in fig .  1",
    "a relay decodes a message based on signals received from all `` upstream '' nodes . at the same time , although all relays simultaneously transmit , `` downstream '' relays do not cause interference to the upstream relays because the latter ones know the messages sent by the downstream relays and can cancel created interference @xcite .",
    "the limitation of this scheme is that , if the received signal is weak at even one df relay , the end - to - end rate will be decreased ; relays with weak received signals should compress their signals .",
    "however , when some of the relays compress , interference cancellation at df relays is _ no longer possible _ because df nodes do not know the compressed signals .",
    "this can decrease the rate at df relays and thus the overall performance . to overcome this drawback of mixed cooperative strategies",
    ", we present the _ snnc with rate splitting _ scheme that allows df relays to partially decode interference created by snnc relays .",
    "the idea is to incorporate superposition coding @xcite into snnc encoding . in particular , in the proposed scheme ,",
    "a relay performing snnc will , once it determines the compression index it wants to send , split the compression index into two indexes each of a lower rate and use superoposition coding to encode them .",
    "the lower encoding rate enables df relays to decode one part of the quantization index and hence cancel part of interference .",
    "this in turn increases the end - to - end rate .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are the following :        1 .",
    "a novel relaying strategy is proposed and analyzed .",
    "it is demonstrated that , in a single - relay channel @xcite , rate splitting does not reduce snnc rate .",
    "note that in this channel , rate splitting can not bring gains because there are no multiple relays deploying different schemes .",
    "3 .   for the general discrete memoryless two - relay network ( shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , an achievable rate of the proposed cooperative strategy is derived .",
    "the obtained rate is evaluated for gaussian two - relay networks ; rate gains of the proposed snnc - rs coding scheme compared to other coding schemes are demonstrated .",
    "we denote random variables with upper case letters and their realizations with the corresponding lower case letters .",
    "we drop subscripts of probability distributions if the arguments of the distributions are lower case versions of the random variables .",
    "consider a discrete memoryless two - relay channel shown in fig .",
    "this is the smallest network that captures gains from our proposed scheme .",
    "the source wishes to send message @xmath0 from the message set @xmath1 to the destination node @xmath2 .",
    "the channel is described by the conditional probabilities @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respective input and output alphabets at nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a @xmath12 code for the two - relay network consists of the message set @xmath13 , encoding functions at the source @xmath14 , and at the relays @xmath15 and the decoding function @xmath16 .",
    "the average error probability of the code is given by @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "a rate @xmath18 is achievable if , for any @xmath19 , there exists , for a sufficiently large @xmath20 , a code @xmath12 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the capacity is the supremum of all achievable @xmath18 .",
    "we analyze an encoding strategy in which relay @xmath22 deploys df , and relay @xmath23 deploys snnc - rs .",
    "the code construction , encoding and decoding are specified in the appendix .",
    "quantization at relay @xmath23 is performed as in snnc ; the difference between snnc - rs and snnc schemes is in the addition of superposition coding in snnc - rs which is used to encode the quantization index at relay @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , instead of using a single codebook to encode the quantization index ( say at rate @xmath24 ) , relay @xmath23 splits the quantization index into two indexes and encodes them via superposition coding using two codebooks at rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 .",
    "each codebook thus has a lower rate than @xmath24 . the lower encoding rate ( than @xmath24 ) used in snnc - rs enables relay @xmath22 to , in addition to decoding the source message @xmath0 , also decode one part of the quantization index sent by relay @xmath23 thereby reducing observed interference .",
    "we consider joint decoding at relay @xmath22 .",
    "the destination uses backward decoding to decode the source message and the quantization index . before analyzing the proposed scheme for the two - relay channel , we show the following important property of the snnc - rs scheme for the single - relay channel @xcite .",
    "rate splitting at the relay does not decrease the snnc rate in the single - relay channel",
    ".    the proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have the following result for the two - relay channel .",

    "* eq . ( 56 ) ) given by @xmath32 for any joint distribution factors that factors as ( [ eqn : pmf ] ) .",

    "[ thm : remark2 ] when @xmath34 bound ( [ eqn:2r ] ) is loose compared to the sum of the rates given by ( [ eqn : jd1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : jd3 ] ) .",

    "that the relay @xmath22 uses successive decoding whereby it first decodes the part of the quantization index and then the source message , the corresponding achievable region with mixed df and snnc - rs is given by the next theorem .    _",

    "the proof follows the same steps as the proof for theorem [ thm : mainresult ] .",
    "we next evaluate the rate given by theorem [ thm : mainresult ] for gaussian channels .",
    "we then compare it to the rate achieved with the mixed encoding scheme that does not use rate splitting , as well as to the schemes in which both relays decode - and - forward or perform noisy network coding .",

    "we observe that the proposed scheme reduces the gap to the cut - set bound and outperforms the other strategies for the considered topology .",
    "the increasing gap between the proposed scheme and df - snnc without rate splitting illustrates the gain of the former : without rate - splitting , the mixed strategy is limited by the rate to the df relay that suffers interference from the nnc relay .",
