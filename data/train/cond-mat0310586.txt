    "the microscopic static and dynamic properties of liquid @xmath1he-@xmath0he mixtures are characterized by the interplay between the fermi ( @xmath0he ) and bose ( @xmath1he ) statistics , the interatomic interaction , and the quantum - mechanical zero - point motion@xcite . moreover",
    ", the pauli exclusion principle strongly influences the stability of the mixture@xcite .",
    "dilute solutions of @xmath0he atoms in liquid @xmath1he form a prototype quantum liquid as an example of an interacting boson - fermion mixture .",
    "indeed the presence of @xmath0he affects the condensate fraction @xmath11 , the superfluid fraction @xmath12 of @xmath1he , the individual momentum distributions , n(p),and the single - atom mean kinetic energy , @xmath8 , of the two isotopes . in recent years",
    ", considerable efforts have been addressed to the understanding of microscopic static and dynamical properties in helium mixtures from both the experimental and the theoretical points of view @xcite .",
    "experimental deep inelastic neutron scattering ( dins ) results have revealed significant and interesting discrepancies between theory and experiment as far as determination of the condensate fraction @xmath11 in the superfluid phase , mean kinetic energy @xmath13 of the lighter isotope , and momentum distributions are concerned @xcite . here , @xmath5 is the concentration of @xmath0he in the mixture .",
    "we stress that a substantial agreement between theories exists for the values of @xmath11 and @xmath13 for low concentration mixtures @xcite .",
    "this discrepancies have to be compared with the remarkable agreement found between theory and experiments for pure high density liquid and solid @xmath0he@xcite and pure fluid and solid @xmath1he@xcite , respectively .",
    "the single - atom mean kinetic energies @xmath9 reflect the localization of the two isotopes in the mixture and are influenced by the mixture concentration@xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of dins measurements in the concentration range @xmath14 @xcite , is that @xmath13 is essentially independent of @xmath5 , indicating a local environment of the @xmath0he atoms in the mixtures similar to that of pure liquid @xmath0he .",
    "ground state simulation techniques provide an insight into the local environment of @xmath0he and @xmath1he in liquid he mixtures and pure he liquids , allowing the evaluation of both partial radial distribution functions and single particle mean kinetic energies .",
    "in particular , simulation results for partial radial distribution functions , @xmath15 , in low concentration mixtures ( @xmath16 ) , show two distinct features .",
    "the radial distribution function @xmath17 and local density profile , @xmath18 , are very similar to @xmath19 , @xmath20 and to the pure @xmath1he radial distribution function @xcite .",
    "the second feature is that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are markedly different from @xmath21 , @xmath22 and from pure @xmath0he radial distribution function .",
    "these findings support a picture where the @xmath0he atoms experience a greater localization in the mixture with respect to pure @xmath0he , while the @xmath1he atoms show a microscopic structure similar to pure liquid @xmath1he .",
    "the first feature accounts for the increased @xmath23 values with respect to pure liquid @xmath0he @xcite . in the case of @xmath1he",
    ", @xmath24 is on the contrary similar to the pure liquid value for @xmath25 , and a decrease of @xmath24 with increasing concentration is found , in agreement with experimental dins results .",
    "it has to be stressed that the similarity of @xmath17 and @xmath19 does not necessarily imply similar values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the mixture .",
    "moreover , since the atomic density @xmath26 in the mixtures is always larger than the atomic density of pure liquid @xmath0he , dins results show that @xmath27 is also independent of @xmath26 ; this , again , is in contrast with the widely - assessed density - dependence of mean kinetic energy of all quantum fluids and solids . as far as the experimental values of @xmath28 in the @xmath29 range are concerned , these were found to be in agreement with microscopic calculations , resulting in a decrease of the kinetic energy of the @xmath1he atoms with increasing concentration .    these findings motivated the present measurements , which were performed over a wider concentration range , i.e. @xmath30 , and with an increased statistical accuracy than previous dins experiments @xcite .",
    "at present dins is the only experimental technique which allows direct access to single - particle dynamical properties , such as the momentum distribution , @xmath31 , and mean kinetic energy @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "experimentally this is achieved by exploiting the large values of wavevector and energy transfers involved in neutron scattering with epithermal neutrons @xcite .",
    "the scattering process is well described within the framework of the _ impulse approximation _ ( ia ) . in the ia",
    "the dynamical structure factor @xmath33 , which determines the scattered intensity , is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the atomic mass of the struck nucleus .",
    "the scaling properties of the scattering law can be expressed in terms of a scaling function : @xmath36 @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the west scaling variable @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath39 , often referred to as the _ neutron compton profile _ ( ncp ) or longitudinal momentum distribution @xcite , represents the probability density distribution of @xmath40 , the atomic momentum component along the direction of momentum transfer @xmath41 . in the present case",
    "the dependence on the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath41 will be omitted given the absence of preferred orientations in the liquid samples .",
    "the values for @xmath42  are obtained by exploiting the second moment sum rule for @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the standard deviation of @xmath43 .",
    "dins spectra from a liquid @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture will be then composed of two distinct contributions , one corresponding to the @xmath1he ncp , @xmath46 , and , in a different region of the dins spectra , one to the @xmath0he ncp , @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 functions can be separately analyzed and from their lineshape properties the momentum distributions and mean kinetic energies can be determined .",
    "the dins measurements were carried out on the vesuvio instrument , an inverse - geometry spectrometer operating at the isis pulsed neutron source ( chilton , didcot - uk)@xcite . on this instrument",
    "the ncp spectrum is reconstructed using the filter difference technique which consists of measuring the time of flight of the neutrons scattered by the sample ; the final energy is selected by a resonant foil analyzer located between sample and detectors @xcite . for the present experiment",
    "the @xmath49 ev resonance of a @xmath50au foil filter was chosen .",
    "the scattered neutrons were detected by 32 glass scintillators ( @xmath51li - enriched fixed - angle elements ) placed over an angular range @xmath52 @xmath53 , yielding average wavevector transfers of @xmath54@xmath3 and @xmath55@xmath3 for @xmath0he and @xmath1he respectively .",
    "these large values of wavevector transfers ensured that deviations from the ia , generally described in terms of the _ final state effects _",
    "( fse ) @xcite were negligible and did not affect significantly the recoil peak shapes @xcite .",
    "the corresponding average energy transfers accessed were @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath0he and @xmath1he respectively .",
    "for highly absorbing @xmath0he this energy yields a favourable ratio between the absorption and scattering cross section of about @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the experiment has been performed along the @xmath59 k isotherm . known",
    "amounts of gaseous @xmath0he and @xmath1he were first mixed in a reservoir at @xmath60 .",
    "six mixtures were prepared , for different @xmath0he concentrations , namely @xmath61 .",
    "the mixtures were then allowed to condense into the sample cell to the homogeneous liquid phase at t= @xmath59 k. special attention was paid to ensure that the liquid samples were in saturated vapour pressure conditions ( svp ) ; this was achieved by measuring the vapour pressure of the samples on the top of the sample cell by a baratron pressure transducer .",
    "the liquid samples were contained in a square flat aluminium cell ( 6 cm width , 6 cm height , 0.5 cm thickness ) placed in a liquid helium flow cryostat ; the sample temperatures were recorded by two ge resistance thermometers located at the upper and lower ends of the sample cell , resulting in an average temperature @xmath62 throughout the measurements .",
    "experimental values of vapour pressure for each mixture composition @xmath5 were found to be in agreement with svp data in the literature @xcite . for each composition",
    "dins spectra were recorded for runs lasting about 24 hours .",
    "the time - of - flight spectra were and normalized to the monitor counts by using standard routines available on vesuvio @xcite . in figure 1 a typical time of flight spectrum",
    "as recorded from a single detector for the @xmath63 mixture is displayed .    from this figure",
    ", one can note that the recoil peaks from the two different atomic masses occur at well separated positions in the time of flight spectrum .",
    "this is the case for the whole set of data in the angular range explored . due to the high values of wavevector transfer",
    "accessed , the recoil peaks can be analyzed in wavevector spaces , i. e. @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath0he and @xmath1he respectively .",
    "the fixed - angle experimental resolution , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 fixed - angle detector element , was determined for each detector through a standard vesuvio experimental calibration using a lead sample .",
    "the @xmath66 as in previous measurements on @xmath69he @xcite and @xmath70he @xcite , is well described by a voigt function , whose parameters are @xmath71 @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath72 and @xmath74 @xmath72 , @xmath75 @xmath72 , where @xmath76 is the standard deviation of the gaussian component and @xmath77 is the half width at half maximum of the lorentzian component .",
    "a parallel procedure has also been set - up using monte carlo neutron transport simulation codes for the vesuvio spectrometer @xcite in order to simulate the complete moderator - sample - detector neutron transport , including multiple neutron scattering and energy dependent neutron absorption .",
    "this procedure provided simulated dins measurements , a simulated resolution function @xmath78 which agreed with both experimental data and experimentally calibrated @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this ensured the reliability of the current calibration procedure , and also allows the observed @xmath80 to be described by a convolution of the longitudinal momentum distribution and the instrumental resolution function @xcite .",
    "the effects of the @xmath0he neutron absorption on the measured scattering from the liquid mixtures have been examined in detail , using both an analytical approach as well as a deterministic monte carlo simulation procedure . in @xmath0he",
    "the neutron absorption cross section is energy - dependent with the typical 1/v variation , with a value of 5333 b for 25 mev neutrons @xcite .",
    "the incident energy range covered by the measured @xmath1he and @xmath0he recoil peaks were 9 - 15 ev and 13 - 20 ev respectively ( using au absorption filters ) .",
    "although the absorption cross section of @xmath0he has a relatively smooth variation in these ranges , we analyzed in detail the effects on the measured neutron compton profiles .",
    "an approach for the analytic correction of absorption in strongly absorbing media was first proposed by sears @xcite .",
    "the double - differential scattering cross section is calculated by evaluating the distribution of scattered neutrons from a sample of finite size , with the quantities @xmath81 , the scattering function , and @xmath82 , the total cross section per unit volume for a neutron with wavevector k , occurring as parameters of the boltzmann equation in the neutron transport theory @xcite . in the @xmath0he case @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the absorption and scattering cross sections per unit volume ;",
    "the beam attenuation due to multiple scattering is also found to be negligible , since the ratio of double to single scattering is of the order of @xmath86 @xcite . in the case of a slab shaped sample and backscattering geometry ,",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the double - differential cross section for single scattering is given by : @xmath87 n_3 \\sigma   \\frac{k_f}{4\\pi k_i}s(q,\\omega)\\]][abs ] where a is the surface area of the sample , @xmath88 is the @xmath0he atomic number density and @xmath89 is the atomic scattering cross section .",
    "the wavevector dependence of @xmath84 is expressed by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the imaginary part of the coherent scattering length@xcite .",
    "experimental time of flight spectra from different fixed - angle detectors have been transformed into @xmath40 space and described in terms of the fixed - angle neutron compton profiles @xmath92 using standard vesuvio procedures ; details of the transformation of time of flight spectra in fixed - angle neutron compton profiles are accurately described in refs .",
    "@xcite ; in order to correct for the incident - wavevector dependent absorption an analytical correction has been applied to the y - transformed data : @xmath93\\label{corr } \\label{cfact}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the wavevector dependent absorption of @xmath0he , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the scattering cross section for @xmath0he and @xmath1he respectively . in the case of inverse - geometry spectrometers such as vesuvio ,",
    "the final wavevector is constant , and for a fixed angle spectrum , eq .",
    "[ cfact ] assumes the form @xmath97\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants depending on the scattering angle and the concentration @xmath5 ; finally , due the zero - order sum rule for j(y ) , @xmath100 ( the suffix @xmath101 is then omitted in the next sections ) have been normalised to unity @xcite .",
    "the concentration dependent factor was first proposed by hilton et al .",
    "@xcite and is particularly valid under the current experimental conditions of large wavevector and energy transfers , where cross correlation between @xmath0he and @xmath1he cross sections are negligible . as a complementary procedure the monte carlo neutron transport code dinsms @xcite has been also employed to evaluate multiple scattering contributions and to test the analytical absorption corrections in the mixtures .",
    "in particular this code accounts for the energy dependent absorption of the mixtures employing the following expression : : @xmath102e^{-n[x(\\sigma_3+\\sigma_a)+ ( 1-x)\\sigma_4]t}dt\\ ] ] which represents the probability that a neutron travelling along the @xmath103 direction within the slab - shaped sample will scatter between @xmath104 and @xmath105 . as expected , the ratio of double to single scattering intensities varied between @xmath106 for the @xmath107 mixture and @xmath108 for the @xmath109 mixture , in agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "therefore multiple scattering corrections were neglected . moreover , by comparing the ratio of simulated data in momentum space with and without absorption contributions included , the analytical correction factor , ( eq . [ corr ] ) was recovered .",
    "an example of a correction factor , as derived from simulations for a @xmath63 mixture for a scattering angle of @xmath110 is presented in figure 3 .",
    "the experimental spectra for each mixture composition were converted to @xmath0he and @xmath1he momentum space . following this procedure a single function , @xmath43 ,",
    "averaged over all the 32 detectors was derived for each isotope and for each composition .",
    "the ncp were analysed by simultaneously fitting the two recoil peaks appearing in @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the component centered at @xmath111 in @xmath43 was fitted by a model function @xmath112 broadened by the instrumental resolution .",
    "the other component , centered at negative(@xmath1he ) or positive ( @xmath0he ) @xmath40 values were fitted using a voigt function . the model function , @xmath112 , used to describe the longitudinal momentum distribution was of the form :    @xmath113\\ ] ]    where @xmath114 is the _",
    "n - th _ hermite polynomial , and @xmath89 and @xmath115 are fitting parameters ; this functional form was applied by sears @xcite for the analysis of neutron scattering from pure liquid @xmath1he , and a generalized form , including angular dependencies , is currently used for momentum distribution spectroscopy in hydrogen containing systems on the vesuvio spectrometer @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath116 and @xmath117 , in order that @xmath112 satisfies the following sum rules :    @xmath118    @xmath119    in the present case orders up to @xmath120 were employed .",
    "the inclusion of higher order polynomials did not result in significant improvements of the fits . as an example , in figure 4 the @xmath47 function for three different compositions is presented , together with the fitted lineshapes . the results for the determination of the mean kinetic energies for the two isotopes and the six mixture compositions are reported in table 1 , and are shown in figure 5 , in comparison with previous experiments and several theoretical predictions .",
    "the present results extend the range of concentration x with respect to previous dins measurements , with improved statistical accuracy . the @xmath1he kinetic energy",
    "is found to decrease with concentration , while the @xmath0he kinetic energy does not depend appreciably on the concentration .",
    "the results of the present experiment show that the kinetic energy of @xmath1he atoms is strongly affected by the addition of @xmath0he ; this is expected from density and quantum statistics arguments . a remarkable agreement with previous measurements and recent theories",
    "is found , with slight discrepancies with respect to finite temperature method calculations @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the kinetic energy of the @xmath0he atoms appears unaffected by the presence of the higher density boson fluid , which seems to promote @xmath0he delocalization .",
    "it is illustrative to compare the @xmath47 spectra for the @xmath121 mixture and for the pure @xmath0he fluid , as shown in figure 6 , there is no substantial broadening of @xmath47 on going from the pure liquid to the low - concentration mixture .",
    "we stress that in several papers @xcite the discrepancies between experiments and theories on the determinations of @xmath122 have been attributed to high energy tails in the dynamic structure factors , resulting in exponential - like tails in the momentum distributions , which could be masked by background noise , or are not accounted for using inadequate model functions for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that since the high energy tails are due to the repulsive part of the interatomic potential , they are present in the momentum distribution of the @xmath1he component as well .",
    "this is well illustrated by fig .",
    "@xcite , where the momentum distributions of @xmath0he and @xmath1he in an @xmath123 mixture have practically the same high - momentum tails .",
    "the background noise is the same for the two isotopes in the same measurement , while the spectrometer resolution narrows on going from variables @xmath124 to @xmath125 in the same spectra ; therefore one would expect an increased sensitivity to the detection of the high - momentum tails in @xmath47 . to test this hypothesis we simulated a measurement of @xmath47 for an @xmath123 mixture in the experimental configuration of the present measurements .",
    "the momentum distribution published in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath126 of @xmath0he for the @xmath123 mixture at zero temperature was converted to @xmath47 using the general result @xcite : @xmath127 this function shows pronounced high - momentum contributions due to the depletion of the fermi sphere , the fermi wavevector being @xmath128 .",
    "the kinetic energy value , obtained from the second moment of the reconstructed @xmath47 was @xmath129 .",
    "the function was used as input for the dinsms code , which was run for a scattering angle of @xmath110 . the input @xmath47 and the simulated experiment",
    "are reported in figure 7 .",
    "the simulated spectrum was fitted by the convolution of a voigt function , representing the spectrometer resolution , and two model functions : a simple gaussian and the gauss - hermite expansion introduced above ( section iii ) with orders up to @xmath130 .",
    "the use of a single gaussian resulted in @xmath131 , while the use of the gauss - hermite expansion resulted in @xmath132 .",
    "this indicates that the experimentally determined kinetic energies of @xmath0he are altered by less than 2.5 k , ruling out a strong effect of the high - momentum tails on the determination of kinetic energies .",
    "a second test was performed to compare self - consistently the datasets available from the present measurements .",
    "the pure @xmath0he liquid data ( @xmath133 ) were used as the calibration measurement , and @xmath47 was modelled to have the functional form reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to a fermi - like momentum distribution with a discontinuity at the fermi momentum and high - momentum exponential tails ; the resulting kinetic energy was @xmath134 , a value close to the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "this function was convoluted with a voigt function , an `` effective '' resolution to be determined from the fit to the pure liquid data .",
    "the resulting voigt function had the following parameters:@xmath135 @xmath72 , @xmath136 @xmath137 .",
    "this `` effective '' resolution was employed to fit the @xmath107 data , and the resulting kinetic energy was @xmath138 , confirming that no increase in kinetic energy , even in low - concentration mixtures , is indicated in the dins experiments .",
    "this picture suggests that the local environment of the @xmath0he atoms remains unchanged in saturated vapour pressure liquid mixtures . within the same picture , the @xmath139 behaviour results also in a @xmath140 behaviour , where @xmath26 is the total atomic density , which differs radically from the widely assessed atomic - density dependence of kinetic energy of all quantum fluids and solids .",
    "figure 8 shows the @xmath140 behaviour of the mixtures , as compared to @xmath140 of the pure liquid @xcite . the atomic density in the mixture is higher than in pure liquid @xmath0he in equilibrium , and increases up to @xmath141 for @xmath142 , upon adding @xmath1he @xcite . a statistically significant departure from the density - dependence observed in the pure fluid appears for @xmath143 19 nm@xmath144 .",
    "however we stress that in this case the simultaneous changes of density and concentration prevent a thorough picture of the density and concentration dependence of @xmath122 .",
    "systematic studies in several ( concentration , pressure , temperature ) thermodynamic states not previously investigated both experimentally and theoretically are certainly needed on the experimental and theoretical sides . for example , @xmath140 measurements on mixtures at fixed concentration ( fixed concentration and increased pressure and density ) would test whether the density dependence is recovered upon approaching and crossing the liquid - solid transition .",
    "however previous and present results show unambiguously a behaviour of @xmath122 in the mixture which is not density dependent as for other quantum fluids and is not reproduced by any simulation studies .",
    "the interpretation of these results is far from obvious .",
    "two independent measurements @xcite and the present work , have shown unequivocally that the @xmath0he kinetic energy in the mixtures is essentially independent on concentration and density .",
    "further , we have shown that high energy tails can not explain this surprising result .",
    "given the fact that a remarkable agreement between experiment and theory has been found for the pure helium liquids , we hope that our work stimulates further theoretical and experimental effort . from the experimental point of view",
    ", we can envisage that high - resolution and high statistical quality data over an extended range of temperatures , compositions and densities , can be obtained employing novel chopper and resonance filter spectrometers at pulsed neutron sources .",
    "however , the understanding of these results remains a challenge to conventional theories of liquid isotopic helium mixtures .",
