    "recent development of an optical apparatus based on the sagnac interferometer by the group of kapitulnik led to spectacular discoveries of the spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) in the unconventional superconductors @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these experiments measured the rotation angle @xmath4 of the polarization plane of light upon normal reflected from the material surface .",
    "a non - zero value of the kerr angle @xmath4 indicates the trsb in the sample @xcite .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath4 represent clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of polarization and indicate two possible ways of spontaneous breaking of the time - reversal symmetry . in @xmath1",
    ", a non - zero @xmath4 appears at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5k , so the trsb in this material is clearly related to the onset of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the underdoped @xmath3 , a non - zero @xmath4 appears in the temperature range where the pseudogap develops , which is much higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , the trsb in cuprates appears to be due to a second - order phase transition with an order parameter unrelated to superconductivity .    in this paper , we focus on manifestations of the trsb in @xmath1 , which is a quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) metal consisting of weakly coupled conducting layers in the @xmath6 plane @xcite .",
    "it was proposed theoretically that the superconducting pairing in @xmath1 is spin - triplet with the chiral @xmath7 orbital symmetry @xcite . in this state ,",
    "the cooper pairs have the angular momentum @xmath8 pointing perpendicular to the conducting layers of @xmath1 .",
    "this order parameter breaks the time - reversal symmetry and is the two - dimensional analogue of the a phase in superfluid @xmath9he  @xcite .",
    "there is substantial experimental evidence indicating that @xmath1 is indeed a spin - triplet  @xcite @xmath10-wave  @xcite superconductor .",
    "however , the chiral orbital symmetry of the order parameter and the violation of the time - reversal symmetry are still under debate  @xcite .",
    "the early evidence for the trsb came from the muon spin - relaxation measurements  @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the spontaneous polar kerr effect in optics  @xcite and dynamical domains of the superconducting order parameter in josephson junctions  @xcite give strong evidence for the chiral pairing with the trsb  @xcite .",
    "however , the scanning squid and hall probe experiments  @xcite , designed to search for domains with opposite chiralities on the surface of @xmath1 , did not find any evidence for such domains and for the trsb .",
    "the discrepancy between these experimental results shows that the trsb in superconductors is not fully understood and requires further investigation  @xcite .",
    "chiral superconductors with the trsb are expected to have many unusual properties , e.g. , certain vortex excitations with zero - energy majorana modes in the core  @xcite .",
    "these non - local quasiparticle excitations obey non - abelian statistics and are studied in the context of topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the fractional quantum hall state at the filling factor 5/2 was proposed to be analogous to the @xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .    here",
    "we study an important manifestation of the trsb in the superconducting state : the emergence of anomalous ( spontaneous ) hall conductivity @xmath11 in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this study is motivated by the experimental measurement  @xcite of the polar kerr effect in @xmath1 .",
    "according to the textbook calculations using classical electrodynamics  @xcite , the kerr angle @xmath4 is determined by the ac hall conductivity @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of light in the experiment .",
    "thus , the experimental observation  @xcite of a non - zero @xmath4 at @xmath13 signifies appearance of a non - zero anomalous ac hall conductivity in the material .",
    "however , a theoretical calculation of the anomalous ac hall conductivity for a chiral @xmath0 superconductor turned out to be a rather non - trivial problem and led to some controversies briefly reviewed in the next subsection .",
    "most of the previous theoretical calculations of the anomalous hall conductivity focused on the clean limit for a chiral translationally - invariant superconductor in the absence of impurities .",
    "however , a straightforward calculation of the current - current correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_line ] and involving interaction with the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components of the electromagnetic vector potential gives zero result @xcite .",

    ", the electric field @xmath27 applied in the @xmath28 direction can not induce a center - of - mass motion of the electron gas in the transverse @xmath29 direction no matter whether the pairing between electrons is chiral or not , because there is no total external lorentz force acting in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "thus , the experimental observation of the polar kerr effect @xcite can not be explained within any model of a clean galilean - invariant chiral superconductor  @xcite .    the general argument given above uses the galilean invariance of a translationally - invariant system .",
    "however , electrons in a crystal are subject to a periodic lattice potential , which breaks translational symmetry and , thus , may invalidate the general argument .",
    "in fact , there are well - known examples of periodic systems , such as the trsb topological insulators and metals , where a topologically non - trivial band structure produces the anomalous hall effect @xcite",
    ". however , this effect has nothing to do with superconductivity and , thus , is not relevant for the kerr effect in @xmath1 .",
    "relation between chiral superconductors and the trsb topological insulators and metals is discussed in more detail in appendix [ sec : insulators ] .      following the general argument presented in the preceding subsection , we realize that , in order to obtain a non - zero anomalous hall conductivity , it is necessary to identify a physical mechanism for producing an external force on the electron gas in the transverse @xmath29 direction .",
    "scattering on impurities breaks translational invariance and provides a mechanism for momentum transfer between electrons and the crystal lattice , which may generate a net force in the @xmath29 direction , if the pairing between electrons is chiral .",
    "making an analogy between a cooper pair with the angular momentum @xmath30 and a spinning baseball , we observe that the baseball does not deflect sideways when flying in vacuum , but does deflect in the air , because friction with the air generates the transverse magnus force . similarly , scattering on impurities can provide an effective friction between the spinning cooper pairs and the crystal lattice and , thus , generate a transverse force .",
    "it should be emphasized that a periodic lattice potential alone , in the absence of impurities , does not produce a non - zero hall conductivity for a chiral @xmath10-wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "it is the random scattering on impurities which provides a mechanism for momentum relaxation in the electron gas .",
    "the effect of disorder on the anomalous hall conductivity in a @xmath0 superconductor was studied by goryo  @xcite .",
    "he considered the skew - scattering processes , which involve triple scattering events on a given impurity .",
    "this process requires existence of a non - zero third moment of the impurity potential averaged over random realizations .",
    "since the third moment is zero for the commonly used gaussian distribution , we call this type of distribution the non - gaussian disorder . a similar model of disorder was used in the context of the anomalous hall effect  @xcite , as well as the spin hall effect  @xcite , for non - superconducting materials . in fact , sinitsyn  @xcite was the first to point out that impurity scattering may contribute to the anomalous hall effect in chiral superconductors .",
    "goryo @xcite calculated the anomalous ac hall conductivity @xmath12 for a @xmath0 superconductor in the limit of high frequencies @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the superconducting gap , and for @xmath33 close to @xmath34 .",
    "this limit is relevant for the experiment @xcite , which utilized @xmath35  ev , whereas the gap at @xmath36 can be estimated from the bcs relation as @xmath37 mev .",
    "goryo found that the anomalous hall conductivity is predominantly real in this limit and behaves as @xmath38 .",
    "however , this result is inconsistent with the general causality relation @xmath39  [ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the real and imaginary parts of the antisymmetric conductivity tensor @xmath40 originating from skew - scattering on impurities for the full range of frequency @xmath2 and temperature @xmath33 consistently with the causality relation .",
    "we find that the factor of @xmath41 was overlooked in the calculation of ref .",
    "then we consider a more conventional model of gaussian disorder and calculate the feynman diagrams where electrons scatter on two different impurities .",
    "we show that these diagrams also give a non - zero anomalous hall conductivity for a chiral superconductor if the particle - hole asymmetry is taken into account .",
