    "one of the most important goals of studying strong interaction physics is to understand the behaviour of hadrons and hadronic interactions on the basis of the quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "one of the powerful tools for this purpose is the qcd sum rule proposed by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov  @xcite . using the method of the qcd sum rule",
    "one can obtain relations between the properties of hadrons and the vacuum matrix elements of the quark - gluon composite operators  @xcite .",
    "the idea of the qcd sum rule has been extended to the investigation of hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the present authors have formulated the qcd sum rules for spin - dependent nucleon - nucleon interactions and have studied their physical implications . the basic object of the study in the work has been the nucleon matrix element of the correlation function of the nucleon interpolating field . in the deep euclidean region",
    "the correlation function is expressed in terms of the nucleon matrix elements of the quark - gluon composite operators using the operator product expansion ( ope ) , which is related with its integral over the physical region by means of the dispersion relation .",
    "the dispersion integral of the correlation function around the nucleon threshold has been investigated in detail .",
    "it has turned out that the integral can be identified as a measure of the nucleon - nucleon interaction strength , which is proportional to the scattering length in the small scattering length limit and to the one half of the effective range in the large scattering length limit .",
    "the obtained sum rules relate the nucleon - nucleon interaction strengths with the nucleon matrix elements of the quark - gluon composite operators .",
    "the sum rules tell us that the interaction strength in the spin - singlet channel is weaker than in the spin - triplet channel , but that the spin - dependent part of the interaction strength is considerably smaller than the spin - independent part .",
    "experimentally , it has been found that there is a loosely bound state , deuteron , in the spin - triplet channel , while there is an almost bound state in the spin - singlet channel , which implies that the interaction is slightly stronger in the spin - triplet channel than in the spin - singlet channel .",
    "this is consistent with the result of sum rules .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to hyperon - nucleon channels just by replacing the nucleon interpolating field by the hyperon interpolating field .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to carry out this procedure .",
    "physically , it is extremely important to understand the various hyperon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions simultaneously in order to achieve a unified view of hadronic interactions .",
    "it is also important in the application to hypernuclear physics since hyperon - nucleon interactions are exprimentally not well known .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the formalism in the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) channel for the sake of completeness . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the wilson coefficients of the ope for the hyperon correlation function and explain how the nucleon matrix elements of the quark - gluon composite operators are determined .",
    "the obtained sum rules for the hyperon - nucleon interaction strengths are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper in sec . v.",
    "we first consider the spin - dependent hyperon correlation function , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the one - nucleon state with momentum @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the nucleon mass ) normalized as @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the normalized hyperon field operator . in this paper , momentum with @xmath21",
    "represents the on - shell momentum .",
    "later , the normalized nucleon field , @xmath20 , is replaced by the unnormalized hyperon interpolating field ( quark - gluon composite field ) , @xmath22 . the following discussion , however , holds as it is for the interpolating field , except for the normalization .",
    "naively , the dispersion relation for the correlation function , @xmath10 , is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 . throughout this paper , whenever we take the imaginary part of a quantity , we approach the real energy axis from above in the complex energy plane .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , @xmath25 is the imaginary part of the retarded correlation function .",
    "the qcd sum rules are obtained by evaluating the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr ] ) by the ope and expressing the right - hand side in terms of physical quantities .",
    "let us consider the singularities of @xmath10 as functions of @xmath26 .",
    "in the complex @xmath26 plane , @xmath10 has a branch cut from the lowest @xmath27 continuum threshold to the right and another branch cut starting from the lowest @xmath28 continuum threshold to the left where @xmath29 denotes the baryon number .",
    "@xmath10 has second - order poles at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the hyperon mass .",
    "in addition , the coefficient of the pole at @xmath32 is the @xmath0 t - matrices @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a positive energy solution of the free dirac equation for the hyperon .    in order to take out the pole contribution from @xmath36 it is convenient to define off - shell @xmath0 t - matrices by @xmath37 note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : offt ] ) is just a definition of the t - matrix off the mass shell , but the lsz reduction formula shows rigorously that it is the t - matrix on the mass shell .    in order to eliminate the pole contribution at @xmath38 from the correlation function , we introduce the projection operators @xmath39 by @xmath40 which have the properties @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then we define the projected correlation functions by @xmath44 the projected correlation functions are related to the off - shell t - matrices as @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , @xmath47 has a second - order pole at @xmath32 but not at @xmath38 .",

    "parameterize the right - hand side in terms of physical quantities .",
    "we study the behaviour of the two terms on the left - hand side in .eq : impi .",
    "for this purpose it is important to note that the off - shell optical theorem holds for @xmath55 . when the center - of - mass energy is above the threshold of the @xmath0 channel and below the threshold of the next channel , only the @xmath0 states contribute in the intermediate states , and the off - shell optical theorem is simplified as @xmath56 in order to simplify the notation we introduce the scattering amplitude @xmath57 by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ". moreover , we go to the center - of - mass frame ( @xmath61 ) and restrict ourselves to the @xmath14-wave .",

    "( [ eq : ot ] ) we have @xmath66 and find that the off - shell scattering amplitude , @xmath67 , has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the scattering length .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath70 is different from the effective range @xmath71 , but @xmath70 coincides with @xmath71 in the limit @xmath72 : @xmath73    we proceed to the integral of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bsr ] ) , @xmath74 , in the vicinity of @xmath75 , @xmath76 the integral , @xmath74 , can be decomposed as @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iii ] ) , the first term , @xmath78 , is the threshold contribution , given by @xmath79 the second term , @xmath80 , is the continuum contribution , given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 the last term , @xmath83 , is the bound - state contribution , which has to be taken into account if there is a bound state , given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the pole momentum , @xmath88 .    by performing the integral , the continuum contribution becomes @xmath89 which is simplified in two limits of @xmath69 as @xmath90    similarly , the bound - state contribution becomes @xmath91 where @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 , @xmath94,\\cr & & c \\rightarrow \\left(1-{r \\over a}\\right)+o\\left({1 \\over a^2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the bound - state contribution is simplified as @xmath95    let us suppose that one can freely change the interaction strength of hyperon - nucleon and examine how the integral @xmath74 should change as a function the interaction strength .",
    "when the interaction is weak , the scattering length is also small , and the integral @xmath74 is dominated by @xmath78 : @xmath96 as the interaction becomes stronger , the scattering length increases and the integral , @xmath74 , also increases . as the interaction strength increases further , the scattering length eventually diverges when the bound state is just formed .",
    "just before the bound state is formed , the integral @xmath74 becomes @xmath97 and just after the bound state is formed , it becomes @xmath98 this shows that before and after the bound state is formed the integral is continuous , though the scattering length diverges with opposite signs .",
    "this observation leads us to conjecture that the integral around the threshold is a measure of the @xmath0 interaction strength .    here",
    "we study the integral in a solvable case , namely the separable potential model : @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100 we find that the integral @xmath74 is proportional to the potential strength @xmath101 if the range parameter @xmath102 is fixed .",
    "based on this conjecture we define the @xmath0 interaction strength , @xmath103 , by @xmath104    in the dispersion integral , the imaginary part of the correlation function , @xmath105 , contains the contribution from all possible intermediate states such as those of the @xmath0 , @xmath106 channels and so on .",
    "however , only the @xmath0 channel contributes around the threshold .",
    "we assume that the contribution from the @xmath0 state is taken into account by the form of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) and that the rest is approximated by an asymptotic form of the correlation function starting from an effective threshold , @xmath107 , for the @xmath27 channels other than the @xmath0 channel and @xmath108 for the @xmath28 channels : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the asymptotic form of the correlation function in the ope and the normalization constant @xmath111 is explicitly included ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is possible now because the contribution from states other than those of the @xmath0 channel is exponentially suppressed compared to the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "let us turn to the ope .",
    "we take the interpolating fields of hyperons  @xcite as @xmath113 for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the other hyperons where @xmath116 , @xmath117 for the @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath117 for the @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 for the @xmath123 and @xmath121 , @xmath124 for the @xmath125 . since the interction strength for the @xmath126 channel",
    "is obtained by averaging those for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 , @xmath22 for the @xmath127 is not needed here .",
    "@xmath128 denotes the charge conjugation operator and @xmath69 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are color indices .",
    "we take into account all the operators of dimension less than or equal to four .",

    "it was also found that the @xmath5 ( @xmath209 ) interaction strength is greater than the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) interaction strength since matrix elements of up quark operators are greater than those of the down quark operators .",
    "taking uncertainties into account , however , we tentatively concluded that the @xmath205 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 channels have similar interaction strengths .",
    "it turned out that the strengths are smaller in the @xmath221 and @xmath222 channels than in other channels and also that the @xmath223 channel has the weakest interaction in all channels .",
    "also found is that the spin - dependent strength is smaller than the spin - independent strength in all channels .",
    "the spin - dependence in the @xmath216 and @xmath222 channels is oposite to other channels .",
    "the results are compared with those of the phenomenological meson - exchange models .",
    "the results of the sum rules and the meson - exchange models have some common tendencies .",
    "they are , however , different in some other respects .    in the present paper",
    "we have ignored the coupling of different hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon channels such as @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath4-@xmath240-@xmath241",
    ". one might be able to formulate the sum rule for the transition , @xmath242 , by considering the time - ordered product of the sigma field and the lambda field , which is an interesting extension of the present approach .",
    "another interesting possibility is to study hyperon matrix elements of the quark - gluon composite operators by means of the sum rule .",
    "this would be done by constructing sum rule starting from the hyperon matrix element of the nucleon correlation function and relating the obtained hyperon - nucleon interaction strengths with the ones in the present paper .",
    "these applications would provide us with important new information about hyperon - nucleon interactions and hyperon structures .",
