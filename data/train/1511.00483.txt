    "it has often been argued and there is corroborating empirical evidence which suggests that stock market prices exhibit wave like properties  @xcite . in classical financial mathematics",
    "there were conducted fundamental investigations  @xcite to find adequate stochastic processes matching the real financial data : brownian  @xcite , geometric brownian  @xcite , general lvy processes  @xcite . from the point of view of quantum - like approach  @xcite , the problem can not even be formulated in such a way , due to the lack of the description of the whole financial market as one single space @xcite .",
    "the financial markets have their own intrinsic geometrical structure @xcite , but there is no classical stochastic process which would match with the real financial data . despite some early studies to characterize the nature of topological space of time series data by identifying the state of a financial market @xcite as a complex non - stationary system , there exists no definition of the space of time series data which satisfies the definition of topological space with the fixed - point property , i.  e. , it fulfills the @xmath0  kolmogorov separation axiom @xcite . in other words one financial time series are composed of infinitely many random variables in which the average of all of this random variables not always converge to single variable ( single kolmogorov space ) .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations in the real market are not gaussian @xcite unless they decay as fast as gaussian , and the history shows that the catastrophic loss ( gain ) is more likely than the gaussian model .    the instantaneous return on the financial times - stock exchange ( ftse ) and all share index is viewed as a friction - less particle moving in one - dimensional square well ( potential barrier ) but where there is a non - trivial probability of the particle tunneling into the well s retaining walls with some prices uncertainty  @xcite . the potential barrier approach is frequently used for barrier option calculations in the stock market  @xcite .",

    ", stochastic models may be able to reproduce the historic observations with similar accuracy .",
    "indeed , the ( possible ) existence of hidden variables was at the heart of the early critique of quantum theory .",
    "it is almost self - evident that the return on a stock depends on many factors that have not been modeled .",
    "the question nevertheless is not just one of having a more efficient description of the dynamics . unlike hidden variables describing physical phenomena , the factors that influence the dynamics of a stock are expected to change over time .",
    "moreover , it is not clear how economic factors such as gross national product influence the value of any given stock at any given point in time .",
    "the observed scaling of the return distributions for various stocks in different economic environments strongly suggests that all these `` hidden '' factors find their expression in the mean return and the variance of the returns .    in the economics a problem of the asymmetric information of inefficiency of efficiency market hypothesis still exists .",
    "this problem was solved by some micro economists by using the duality theory of walrasian utility function  @xcite but it is still present in the macro economics time series as so called memory process in the time series of stock price .",
    "the dynamics that determines the shape of the return distributions , on the other hand , must be self - consistent and largely immune to the influence of `` hidden '' variables that are specific for a company and economic and political climate .",
    "hidden variables in our model is an analogy with hidden dimensions in string theory , both are non - visible and non - measurable , however , they have great influence on the whole system .    especially for the learning of buying and selling signals for the currency pairs as well in financial trading , the position is a binding commitment to buy or sell a given amount of financial instruments .",
    "open positions remain subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate .",
    "open positions are closed by entering into a trade that takes the opposite position to the original trade .",
    "the net effect is to bring the total amount for currency pair back to zero .",
    "the bid price ( @xmath1 ) is always less than the ask price ( @xmath2 ) because brokers pay less than they receive for the same currency pair .",
    "the spread represents your cost to trade with a broker .",

    "almost all known econometric models applied on a long term basis in the financial forex market do not work sufficiently well , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the practical demonstration of the usability of the previously derived model in the real market conditions , e.  g. , online trading with real data . for this purpose",

    "was used @xcite .",

    "various sources serve as input data for the algorithm , e. g. , real time data or historical data of currency rates , we have chosen the second one .",
    "data are handled by the current prediction model ( pmbcs prediction model ) . in the heart of the algorithm there",

    "but the algorithm works also in the parallel way .",
    "the values of the momentum predictors are statistically evaluated with the results of the open / close trade positions and compared with predicted values ( predictors evaluator ) .",

    "the left side of the scheme outlines future strategy evaluator .",
    "its purpose is to evaluate the trade strategy parameters and this way to control the risk in a more sophisticated way .",
    "however , in this paper , the values of the trade strategy parameters were fixed to reasonable constants throughout the simulations , e.  g. , the maximum number of opened trades was set to 10/hour .",
    "the main reason is that the online process of finding the best strategy parameters is time consuming and needs intense computing power , which was not able at the time of article preparation . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : spread ] ]",
    "as was mentioned in the previous section , the online trade system operates with two kinds of parameters , there are trade strategy parameters and optimal string parameters .",
    "we have not pretended to determine all parameters , as the process of the online trading is robust and it requires a verified and confident system .",
    "our purpose was to demonstrate how the string parameters influence the results and to find out the method how they can be optimized in a simulation process .",
    "however , the trade strategy parameters were chosen as close as possible to the real ones .      as the starting point of our prediction simulations we considered the string parameters which describe the momentum function @xmath21 ( see eq  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) ) : @xmath4  the length of momentum string ( the number of ticks or time period ) , @xmath5  the quotient or the exponent of the momentum ( a deformation of string ) , @xmath6  the frequency of the momentum function and last but not least , the momentum function depends also on the @xmath13  the regular function .",

    "last but not least , the proper algebraic and geometric construction of the space of time series , possible under a kolmogorov space concept with consistent separation axiom , could help with the analyses of nonstationary time series models , the volatility clustering phenomena in financial time series data or the separation of hidden markov transition probability state in quantum entaglement state",
    ". there are some indications that such a concept could be realized as a topological space with a few hidden states in extradimensions of loop space of time series data",
    ". it will be interesting to join hidden states with the empiricaly observed characteristic correlation structures patterns ( e.  g. @xcite ) , but the other investigations must take place to the future .",
