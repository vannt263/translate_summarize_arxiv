    "once @xmath55 is known , all linear and non - linear spectroscopic signals can be calculated via the line - shape function @xmath59 with knowledge of the reorganization energy @xmath60 and the temperature dependent coupling parameter , which reduces to @xmath61 at high temperatures .",
    "we use such complete information about the transition frequency fluctuations due to intramolecular and system bath coupling to derive a detailed line shape theory in paper ii @xcite . here , we concentrate on the intramolecular part of the @xmath55-function which is responsible for the oscillatory dynamics of the line shapes .    although signal detection of one - dimensional fwm signals is relatively straightforward , these methods face an inherent trade - off between time- and frequency - resolution .",

    "( e ) slope of the @xmath62 phase line in the phase 2d spectra . ]    two quantities extracted from the real part of 2d electronic spectra were shown to be directly proportional to the ffcf : the ellipticity of the peak shape @xcite and the center line slope @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity of the peak as a function of @xmath3 is defined as @xcite    @xmath63    where d and a denote the diagonal and anti - diagonal peak widths , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]a we plot this ratio for @xmath64  fs , with the diagonal and anti - diagonal peak widths evaluated at @xmath65-height .",
    "oscillations with a period of 240  fs are clearly recovered . in our previous work",
    "we have shown that these oscillations arise mainly from modulations of the anti - diagonal width , whereas the diagonal width stays nearly constant over the time - range explored in our experiments @xcite .",
    "the center line slope ( cls ) is extracted by taking cuts parallel to the @xmath20-axis and finding the maximum of the peak .",
    "the resulting data points as a function of @xmath21 are fit to a first order polynomial .",
    "the slope of this line is the center line slope ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]a ) .",
    "note that in the work by kwak _",
    "_ @xcite cuts are taken parallel to the @xmath21-axis and the cls is defined as the inverse of the slope of the line connecting the maxima of the slices .",
    "both the ellipticity and the cls can vary between 1 and 0 and directly reflect the @xmath3-dependent part of the ffcf @xcite . the limiting value of 1 can be reached for @xmath66 and in the absence of a homogeneous component .",
    "the deviation from the initial value of 1 can thereby be related to the magnitude of the homogeneous component , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . relaxation and spectral diffusion processes during @xmath3 lead to a decrease of the ellipticity and the cls , until in the long time limit both quantities approach the value of zero , indicative of equal widths along the diagonal and anti - diagonal directions and a slope of the center line that is parallel to the @xmath21-axis . in a previous work",
    "it was argued that the cls has the advantage over the ellipticity of being independent of factors influencing the line - shape ( e.g. finite pulse duration , apodization , etc . ) @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]a we do not observe significant differences between these two quantities .",
    "closely related to the ellipticity of the peak shape is the eccentricity , which is defined as @xmath67 and which has been proposed in earlier works as a measure for the ffcf @xcite .",
    "even though the eccentricity takes the same limiting values as the ellipticity , i.e. 1 if d@xmath68a and 0 if d@xmath69a ( which is the case for a circle ) , the two quantities differ for intermediate cases and therefore can not be compared directly .",
    "as discussed above , a periodic modulation of the rephasing and non - rephasing contribution to the total 2d spectrum induces the observed changes in the real and imaginary parts . in fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]b we plot the relative amplitudes of the rephasing and non - rephasing part of the real 2d spectra .",
    "we clearly observe out - of - phase oscillations of these two contributions , with the rephasing part exhibiting its maxima at @xmath3-times of 200 , 450 , and 650  fs and its minima at @xmath38 100 , 300 , 550 , and 800  fs , and the non - rephasing part showing the opposite behavior , i.e. having its maxima at @xmath3-times corresponding to minima in the rephasing part and vice versa .",
    "@xcite defined an inhomogeneity index @xmath70 as    @xmath71    with @xmath72 being the relative amplitude of the rephasing , and @xmath73 the relative amplitude of the non - rephasing part .",
    "this quantity was shown to directly relate to @xmath55 via @xmath74 . from the inspection of the inhomogeneity index ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]b ) one can notice , that the non - rephasing part exceeds the rephasing part in signal strength around @xmath3-delays of 300 and 550  fs .",
    "for these delays the inhomogeneity index adopts negative values , which is consistent with negative peak shift values observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_3peps_tg_pp]a ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .    in the imaginary part of 2d spectra it is the slope of the nodal line separating the positive and negative contribution that is related to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we extract this slope from our 2d spectra by finding the zero crossing between the positive and negative contribution in the range @xmath75  @xmath76  @xmath1 and fitting of the resulting data points with a first order polynomial .",
    "the slope of the nodal line oscillates with a period of 240  fs ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]d ) .",
    "note that also the slope takes negative values around @xmath77 and 550  fs .",
    "this agrees well with the observation of negative values of the inhomogeneity index ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]c ) and the peak shift ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3peps_tg_pp]a ) . in case of a three - level system",
    "it is the real part that features two peaks of opposite sign , with the positive one stemming from ground state bleaching and stimulated emission and the negative feature arising from excited state absorption . in this case",
    "the slope of the nodal line is extracted from the real part spectra @xcite .    extracting the frequency - frequency correlation function from the phase spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig_2d_am_phase]b ) is done by evaluating the slope of lines of constant phase @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_oszillation]e we plot this slope for @xmath62 evaluated in the frequency range @xmath78@xmath79  @xmath1 .",
    "again , the oscillating pattern exhibits a period of 240  fs with maxima at @xmath3-delays of 200 , 450 , and 650  fs and minima around @xmath38100 , 300 , 550 , and 800  fs .",
    "around 300 and 550  fs the slope of lines of constant phase adopts negative values indicative of a tilt towards the anti - diagonal axis .",
    "intramolecular and system - bath ( solvation ) dynamics can be studied either in time - domain by the frequency - frequency correlation function @xmath55 , or , equivalently , in frequency - domain by the spectral density @xmath80 . in this contribution",
    "we have concentrated on time - domain measures , by presenting different metrics that can be extracted from two - dimensional electronic spectra and that follow the functional form of the frequency - frequency correlation function .",
    "these metrics are the ellipticity , the center line slope , and the inhomogeneity index extracted from the real part spectra , the slope of the nodal line in the imaginary part spectra , and the slope of lines of constant phase in the phase spectra .",
    "peak shift curves of pery measured in solvents of different polarity ( nonpolar , polar , and weakly polar ) featured similar timescales @xcite , thus pointing to weak solute - solvent interactions .",
    "the observed oscillations in the frequency - frequency correlation function can thus be assumed to be dominated by intramolecular dynamics .",
    "the observed beating pattern stems from the fact that during @xmath3 the density matrix does not only evolve in a population state ( ground or excited state ) , but vibrational coherences can be excited as well .",
    "these coherences evolve with a frequency that is given by the difference in frequency of the two states involved . in theoretical works on vibrational effects in 2d - es ,",
    "the vibrational sub - levels could be resolved as a consequence of the customized input parameters @xcite . under experimentally feasible conditions effects as finite pulse durations and finite temperature erode the multipeak structure .",
    "in such a situation , vibrational dynamics can not be followed by the evolution of diagonal and cross peaks , but by the evolution of line - shapes and signal intensities , as has been done in the present contribution . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we performed a fit to the experimental two - dimensional spectra by including two overdamped solvent modes and two underdamped intramolecular modes . in the second paper of this series",
    "we investigate the influence of vibrational coupling on 2d electronic spectra more thoroughly by employing nonlinear response function theory and expanding the frequency - frequency correlation function in terms of huang - rhys factors .",
    "furthermore , we extend the theory also to the case of high frequency modes in which case individual diagonal and cross peaks can be distinguished .",
