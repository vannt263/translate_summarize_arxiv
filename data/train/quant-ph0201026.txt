    "young s experiment , originally the definitive proof of the wave nature of light , commands an essential role in the discussion of the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , in the bohr - einstein - dialogue @xcite , the double - slit experiment was used as a gedanken experiment with individual quanta . in that discussion ,",
    "einstein wanted to argue that quantum mechanics is inconsistent in the sense that one can have path information and observe the interference pattern at the same time , while bohr was always able to demonstrate that einstein s point of view was not correct . indeed , if one carefully analyzes any situation where it is possible to fully know the path the particle took , the interference pattern can not be observed .",
    "likewise , if one observes the full interference pattern , no path information is available .",
    "young s experiment today is considered the most beautiful demonstration of the concept of quantum superposition [ fig . 1 ] .",
    "whenever we do not know , not even in principle , which of the two paths the particle takes , the quantum state can be written as @xmath0 in that case , no information whatsoever is available about the slit the particle passes through .",
    "indeed , if one asked which path the particle takes in an experiment for a specific run , one would find the particle in either slit with equal probability .",
    "yet , obviously , this requires the use of detectors .",
    "if one places one detector each into each slit and if one describes the detector states by quantum mechanics , then , clearly , the quantum state of the whole system becomes @xmath1 ) only has the meaning that the property of the particle to take a definite path is related to a property of the detectors .",
    "the two detector states @xmath2 and @xmath3 describe the detector having registered the particle passing through the left and right slit , respectively",
    ". these can even be states of an internal degree of freedom of the interfering particle ( e.g. spin or polarization states or internal atomic states ) .",
    "a proposal for such an experiment has been made by scully _",
    "@xcite performed a neutron interference experiment and drr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an atomic interference experiment where the disappearance of the interference pattern has to be attributed to the correlations between the internal neutron or atomic states , which serve as which - path detectors , and the paths taken inside the interferometer . in these experiments",
    "the loss of interference is due to the fact that path information is available , in principle , independent of the fact whether the experimentalist cares to read it out or not .",
    "if the two detector states are orthogonal , then the two particle states can not interfere , as eq .",
    "( [ detectors ] ) describes then a maximally entangled state and thus one could determine the path of the particle by observing the detector state .",
    "only if the two detector states are not orthogonal @xcite or if they are projected by a measurement onto a state that is orthogonal to neither one of them @xcite then path interference of a certain contrast may reappear , as then the complete knowledge about the path is not available .",
    "technological progress in the times since the bohr - einstein - dialogue made it possible to realize quantum interference with many different particles all the way to massive molecules , like the fullerenes @xcite c-60 and c-70 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the latter experiment , the fullerene molecules are at temperatures as high as 900 k. this implies that they are not completely decoupled from the environment . on the contrary , they typically emit a few photons on their path from the source to the detector @xcite .",
    "so why do interference fringes still appear [ fig .",
    "2 ] ? could one not use the emitted photons to trace the path of the fullerene ?",
    "the reason can easily be understood by referring to eq .",
    "( [ detectors ] ) .",
    "the wavelength of the emitted photons is typically of the order of a few micrometers , which has to be compared to the path separation , which is much lower .",
    "therefore , the states of the two photons emitted by a fullerene on either of the interfering paths are nearly identical , implying that the photons carry virtually no information into the environment .    the modulus of the scalar product between the two states of the photons corresponding to the emission by a fullerene on either of the interfering paths can be used to quantify the information about the path of the fullerene , which can in principle be extracted if the photons were observed . only if the scalar product is non - zero , then an interference pattern of a certain contrast may appear , as then the path is not completely known .",
    "in general , the contrast ( visibility @xmath4 ) of the interference pattern is equal to the modulus of the scalar product between the two detectors states , @xmath5 .",
    "we now calculate the scalar product between the two photon states which serve as detector states in the fullerene experiment .    for the reason of simplicity we consider the fullerene experiment as a double - slit experiment .",
    "suppose that the interfering fullerene emits @xmath6 photons at the moment it reaches the screen with the two slits .",
    "that is , the photons are emitted by the fullerene either at the left slit or at the right slit .",
    "then the visibility @xmath4 of the fullerene interference pattern at the observation screen is equal to the modulus of the following scalar product @xmath7 because the two possible states are the same for every of the n photons , one can transform eq .",
    "( [ vuk ] ) into @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the two amplitudes ( spherical waves ) of a photon at observation point @xmath10 , which are emitted from the point source localized at the position @xmath11 of the left slit and @xmath12 of the right slit , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 is the wave - number of the photon .    to calculate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ srce ] ) we use the substitution @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the integration volume is @xmath18 .",
    "using straightforward algebra one obtains @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the separation between two slits .",
    "such dependence of the visibility on the number @xmath6 of emitted photons and their wave - number @xmath13 is in agreement with decoherence observed in an atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "it is now clear from eq .",
    "( [ mrmor ] ) that in the extreme case of the wave length much smaller then the slit separation and/or sufficiently large number of emitted photons the visibility @xmath4 vanishes . yet , in the fullerene experiment another extreme case is reached . there",
    "the slit separation @xmath22 , the photons wave length is of the order of @xmath23 , and the estimated number of photons emitted during the entire time of flight of the fullerene are 1 - 2 .",
    "therefore @xmath24 and the high visibility remains preserved .",
    "the possible choice between path information and the observability of interference patterns is one of the most basic manifestations of quantum complementarity , as introduced by niels bohr . following our discussion ,",
    "it is clear that it is the experimentalist who decides which observable to measure .",
    "he can decide , for example , whether to put a detector into the interfering paths or not .",
    "this role of the observer has led to numerous misunderstandings about the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics . very often , and erroneously , a strong subjective element is brought into the discussion , implying that even the consciousness of the observer has a role in the quantum measurement process .",
    "one has to be very careful at this point .",
    "just to follow our example , the observer can decide whether or not to put detectors into the interfering path .",
    "that way , by deciding whether or not to determine the path through the two - slit experiment , he can decide which property can become reality .",
    "if he chooses not to put the detectors there , then the interference pattern will become reality ; if he does put the detectors there , then the beam path will become reality . yet , most importantly , the observer has no influence on the specific element of the world which becomes reality . specifically ,",
    "if he chooses to determine the path , he has no influence whatsoever which of the two paths , the left one or the right one , nature will tell him is the one where the particle is found .",
    "likewise , if he chooses to observe the interference pattern he has no influence whatsoever where in the observation plane he will observe a specific particle .",
    "both outcomes are completely random .",
    "we therefore argue that the observer has a qualitative influence on nature by deciding via his choice of apparatus which quality can manifest itself as reality , but he has no quantitative influence in the sense of which specific result will be the outcome .",
    "it therefore appears that the objective randomness of quantum measurement provides a limit to the control any experimentalist has .",
    "bohr @xcite writes succinctly :  ... a subsequent measurement to a certain degree deprives the information given by a previous measurement of its significance for predicting the future course of phenomena .",
    "obviously , these facts not only set a limit to the extent of the information obtainable by measurement , but they also set a limit to the meaning which we may attribute to such information .",
    "we meet here in a new light the old truth that in our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose the real essence of the phenomena but only to track down , so far as it is possible , relations between the manifold aspects of our experience .",
    "    we will now argue that the impossibility of joint perfect observation of both path and the interference pattern is a natural consequence of the finiteness of the information content of a quantum system . on the basis of a specific measure of information",
    "we will define information content of a quantum system .",
    "that information can fully be contained either in the path or in the interference pattern . in both of them only partially to the extent defined by the fundamental limit on the information content",
    ". therefore we will give a quantitative information - theoretic formulation of quantum complementarity in young s experiment .",
    "in a double - slit experiment the path information is a dichotomic , i.e. a two - valued observable while the position in the interference pattern is a continuous one , which makes the consideration more complicated . for that reason we will modify our set - up to that of an interferometer [ fig .",
    "3 ] where both path information and interference observation are dichotomic . afterwards we will extend our analysis to a double - slit experiment . if in fig .",
    "3 the incoming state @xmath25 has amplitude @xmath26 and the incoming state @xmath27 has amplitude @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , then by the usual rules of a symmetric beam splitter @xcite , the outgoing states @xmath30 and @xmath31 become @xmath32 where we allow for an arbitrary , but constant , phase difference @xmath33 between amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "it now follows that the probabilities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 to find an individual particle in any of the four beams are : @xmath38 evidently , because of unitarity , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "how can we see now the complementarity between the path information and the interference phenomenon ?",
    "it is suggestive to assume that our ability to determine which path the particle takes is related to the modulus @xmath41 of the difference between the probabilities in path 1 and path 2 .",
    "this difference results in the minimal value of 0 if both probabilities are equal and in the maximal value of unity if one of the probabilities is 1 . in the same way",
    "as we assume the information available about the path to be proportional to the modulus of the difference @xmath41 , we may also assume the information in the interference pattern to be proportional to the modulus of the difference @xmath42 .",
    "there is some complementarity between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and we will now express it quantitatively such that the total information is a constant .",
    "indeed , we find , if we introduce our new measure of information @xcite we are led to a quantitative statement of the complementarity principle .",
    "our new measure of information , which is suitable to define the information gain in a quantum experiment , takes probability squares as a quantitative statement of our knowledge .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this particular measure of information is related to the estimation of the future number of occurrence of a specific outcome in a repetition of a binary experiment with two probabilistic outcomes .",
    "we now introduce the following quantitative amounts of information @xmath43 where we have introduced the probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 as those probabilities where we use an additional phase shifter of phase @xmath46 in , say , beam 2 , resulting in the probabilities @xmath47 the reason that we consider also the probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 is that for any specific phase shifts @xmath33 between the two incoming amplitudes , even without path information , our knowledge whether the particle will be found in beam 3 or 4 might not be maximal ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this knowledge however can then be re - established if an additional phase shift of @xmath46 is introduced between the two amplitudes .",
    "now , for the sum of the three individual measures of information , we obtain @xmath48 such a complementarity relation resulting in a constant is possible only if our new measure ( [ measures ] ) is used and could not be obtained if , for example , shannon s measure of information were used @xcite .",
    "an important property of the information content of a quantum system as defined by eq .",
    "( [ content ] ) is that it neither depends on the incoming amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath28 , nor on the phase factor @xmath33 between them .",
    "this means that the total information is invariant under unitary transformations and thus equal for all possible pure incoming states .",
    "therefore different pure incoming states might have different individual measures of information @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 but their sum is always 1 bit of information .    here",
    "@xmath49 describes the path information and @xmath50 and @xmath51 together describe the visibility of the interference effect .",
    "we may therefore introduce the new variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and we obtain the final result ( see also @xcite . ) @xmath54 which is a quantitative statement of the principle of complementarity in young s experiment .",
    "one may reinterpret eq .",
    "( [ central ] ) such that a single particle in young s experiment is just the representative of one bit of information and the experimentalist has the choice by deciding whether to determine the path or not , whether this information resides in the path or in interference or in both of them partially to the extend defined by eq .",
    "( [ central ] ) .",
    "we will now extend our consideration to the situation of a double - slit experiment [ fig .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the interfering particle is @xmath26 in the left slit and @xmath28 in the right slit @xmath55 , where again we allow for an arbitrary phase difference @xmath33 between the two amplitudes .",
    "a typical interference pattern in the fraunhofer limit has a sinusoidal form with a periodicity of @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the de - broglie wave - number , @xmath21 is the separation between the two slits and @xmath58 is the distance between the plane with slits and the observation plane .",
    "consider now two pairs of points @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the observation plane , as shown in fig . 1 . on the basis of our new measure of information",
    "we now introduce the amount of information @xmath62 for the pairs of points @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and similarly @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . here , for example , @xmath68 is the conditional probability to detect particle at @xmath63 given that the particle is to be found either in @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "therefore @xmath69 is the measure of the information that the particle will be found in the specific point @xmath63 or in the specific point @xmath64 given that we know it will be found at @xmath63 or @xmath64 anyway .",
    "the probability density to detect the particle at point @xmath70 in the observation plane in the fraunhofer limit is given by @xmath71.\\ ] ] here the probability distribution is normalized such that the total probability to find the particle somewhere within the interval @xmath72 $ ] of one period is unity .",
    "if we now use @xmath49 for the amount of information contained in the path and @xmath69 in the pair of observation points @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath73 in the pair @xmath66 , @xmath67 , then we obtain again that @xmath74 .",
    "we notice that the four selected points @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for which the probability is calculated are just separated by @xmath75 and can be selected for any choice of @xmath70 . like in the case of the interferometer , we will now summarize all individual measures of information @xmath69 and @xmath73 for all @xmath70 and thus obtain the information contained in the full interference pattern .",
    "we still use @xmath76 as given above for the measure of information contained in the path . yet",
    "now we suggest the information contained in the interfering path to be defined by the integral @xmath77 ^ 2 dy \\label{integral}\\ ] ] note that the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) contains the combinations @xmath78 ^ 2 + [ p(y+y/4)-p(y+3y/4)]^2\\ ] ] for every @xmath70 within the interval @xmath79 , which correspond exactly to the sum @xmath80 introduced above .",
    "one can easily calculate that @xmath81 .",
    "therefore we have again @xmath82 for the sum of the measures of information contained in the path and in the interference pattern .",
    "the discussion presented above obviously is just one specific example of quantum complementarity at work .",
    "it is obvious that this can be extended to much more complicated situations , as for example to the notion of quantum entanglement @xcite . from a fundamental perspective",
    ", this approach suggests that the most basic notion of quantum mechanics is information @xcite .",
