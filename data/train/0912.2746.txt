    "there is a very different nature to the major  major interacting pairs toward q0450 - 132 and q1127145 in that they may have a common gas envelope and therefore provide a slightly different probe of absorption galaxy properties . in cases where ambiguities do not arise in the analysis , we include all the galaxies in our sample .",

    "the quantity @xmath371 is obtained by calculating the optical depth weighted mean of the profiles ( the velocity at which there is equal optical depth to both sides along the profiles ) . in figures  [ fig : plotvoff]@xmath22 , and @xmath135 , we show the velocity offset probability distributions for the edge  on , @xmath288 , and face  on orientations , respectively . for the edge  on case , the absorption velocity offset ranges from @xmath372   with a strong peak around @xmath373  ; it is highly probable to detect absorption to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity . for the @xmath288 case ,",
    "the velocity spread increases to about @xmath374   and develops multiple peaks at @xmath375   and at @xmath376  .",

    "the velocity dispersion is still around @xmath374  .",
    "again , it is unlikely that absorption will be detected at the galaxy systemic velocity .",
    "since most of the gas arises between @xmath374  , with very little at the galaxy systemic velocity , and since most projected galaxy rotation curves have maximum velocities of @xmath374  , it may not be a surprise to observe absorption aligned with the observed galaxy rotation curve .",

    "the technique of quasar absorption lines through cosmological simulations is one of several promising approaches to understanding the dynamics of galaxy halos . at the present time",
    ", simulations of galaxy formation in the cosmological context still need to achieve greater accuracy for modeling stellar feedback . for this study",
    ", we employed a feedback recipe that successfully results in extended metal enriched gas around galaxies .",
    "these simulations result in an equivalent width distribution with an under abundance of larger equivalent widths and a relative over abundance of smaller equivalent widths .",
    "they also under predict the observed mean absorption covering fraction range of @xmath380 @xcite .",
    "the covering fractions for all absorption above 0.02   are as follows : ( 1 ) @xmath381 ( edge  on ) : total 10% , weak 6% , strong 3% ; ( 2 ) @xmath382 ( face  on ) : total 10% , weak 6% , strong 3% ( 3 ) @xmath349 : total 14% , weak 10% , strong 5% .    these mismatches with observations could either be a result of the method in which column densities are determined in the simulations or observational biases . in the simulations",
    ", the determination of the ionization fraction may be underestimated due to the fact that we do not account for shielding of uv photons in the ionization corrections .",
    "it is also possible that the resolution of the simulations may influence the derived column densities and that higher resolution may in fact lead to higher column densities .",
    "we aim to analyze such issues in future work . a possible observational biases that galaxies are selected , identified , and assigned to already known absorption systems .",
    "this may elevate the inferred covering fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do emphasize , however , that in the simulations we do detect absorption out to @xmath383  kpc , as seen in current observations @xcite .    as an additional caveat",
    ", we also remark that the experiment to examine the spatial and kinematic relationship between the galaxy and the absorbing structures in the simulations is very different than the observational experiment in one regard .",
    "we examine a grid of sight lines through a single simulated galaxy , which is in a unique environment and undergoes a unique evolution in the igm . the observational data , on the other hand , sample a single line of sight through various galaxies in various environments and with various evolutionary histories and with random orientation through the galaxy and environment .",
    "we re  emphasize that the simulations , as we have applied them here , provide a first view of the types if physical structures and their spatial and kinematic relationship to a galaxy in the cosmological environment that give rise to absorption . though the details of the absorbing properties are not yet tuned to observations ( and we mention that our experiment is only for a single galaxy using an incomplete sampling of its halo a full comparison with survey statistics is not entirely applicable ) , the dynamical structures themselves in the simulations are robust . that we find some parts of these structures give rise to absorption is not outside expectation given the densities and temperatures of the gas .",
    "the upshot is that , given these discrepancies and concerns , the simulations are not expected to provide a fully quantitative comparison with the data .",
    "however , the simulations do provide a fully self  consistent galaxy model from which we acquired valuable insights for interpreting absorption line observations .      in our study of @xmath318 galaxy at three inclination angles with respect to the simulated quasar lines of sight , we have detected absorption in a variety of structures . absorption was detected in inflowing metal enriched filaments , tidal streams , small satellites , and gas around the host galaxy .",
    "the absorption resides in a `` halo '' of about 100  kpc in size .",
    "the types of structures that form in the simulations ( see figures  [ fig : eonh][fig : fonhi ] ) are a challenge to models in which the absorption is assigned to thick disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the structures also may provide further guidance for expanding upon radial density dependent halo occupation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dla column densities are seen out to @xmath3  kpc , and arise in low mass satellite galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are below the detection limits of even deep _ hst _ images .",
    "the covering fractions of these dense regions are low , this might explain why some bright galaxies at dla redshifts are found at large impact parameters ( e.g. , the 3c 336 @xmath384 dla at @xmath385  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the simulations , the kinematics",
    "are closely coupled to the gas structures .",
    "metal enriched tidal streams and filaments are dominated by infall to the central galaxy , and these structures are selected by absorption ( see figures  [ fig : plotvabs ] and [ fig : plotvr ] ) .",
    "in fact , we find that gas giving rise to the absorption is dominated by inflow ( see figure  [ fig : plotvr_vt ] ) .",
    "inflow velocity gradients are apparent , such that the infall increases as the gas approaches the galaxy .",
    "this inflow is not spatially symmetric .",
    "similar to the observations , the velocity and spatial distributions from the simulations conspire to give rise to absorption to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity even though the absorbing gas is not rotating with the star forming component ( see figures  [ fig : stream ] and [ fig : center ] ) .",
    "the velocity offset probability distribution ( relative to the simulated galaxy ) spans @xmath5   with lowest probability of detecting at the galaxy systematic velocity ( see figure  [ fig : plotvoff ] ) .",
    "thus , the fact that we observe absorption velocities consistent with the galaxy rotation curves may be a natural consequence of the spatial and kinematic distributions of gas in complex environments surrounding galaxies .",
    "the current feedback recipes used in the simulations successfully produces in extended metal enriched halo gas around galaxies .",
    "however , for this single galaxy we derive covering fractions that are lower than the current observed mean values of @xmath386 @xcite . in this particular galaxy halo",
    ", we also find an under abundance of larger equivalent widths and a relative over abundance of smaller equivalent widths .",
    "we have yet to determine if some of these mismatches are due to observational biases in current studies or issues with the feedback / baryon physics implemented in the simulations .",
    "however , the structures in the simulations still provide valuable insight for interpreting absorption line observations .",
    "in our analysis of the simulated galaxy , we do not find systematic rotation near the galaxy , as was suggested by @xcite , but that the gas kinematics reflects processes such as winds and chimneys .",
    "these are characteristic of stellar feedback processed that successfully circumvent the over cooling and angular momentum problems that have plagued simulations @xcite .",
    "observationally , @xcite has inferred outflows in absorption associated with @xmath387 star  forming galaxies ( @xmath388  m@xmath389  yr@xmath15 ) .",

    "our simulated profiles indicated some outflowing gas with velocities of @xmath393   in the inner @xmath394  kpc ( independent of galaxy disk inclination ) .",
    "the absorption profiles produced by the outflows are saturated and span both sides of the systemic velocity of the simulated galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : center ] ) .",

    "these saturated , symmetric profiles are also observed at high redshift ( @xmath395 ) and span the galaxy systemic velocity .",
    "the absorption is attributed to large scale galactic outflows which can be detected at least out to impact parameters of @xmath361  kpc ( steidel et  al .",

    "given the similarities between these two galaxies and those at high redshift observed to have outflows , one possibility is that large scale outflows are responsible for the absorption velocities associated with both galaxies . to explore the outflow scenario for q@xmath27 g1 and q@xmath23 g1",

    "such profiles have been interpreted , in both our simulations and at high redshift , as signatures of outflows .",
    "we find that the observed absorption velocity spread and optical depth distribution may be a function of galaxy inclination .",
    "galaxies with higher inclination exhibit a absorption velocity spread of @xmath235   with a somewhat even distribution of optical depths , whereas , galaxies with lower inclinations exhibit a narrower velocity spread of @xmath3   with a clear optical depth peak at @xmath234  .",
    "a k - s test shows that the optical depth distributions for the high and low inclination bins are not consistent at the @xmath237 level .",
    "these results suggest that the absorbing gas is either disk  like or the spatial distribution and kinematics of the structures producing the absorption ( i.e. , filaments , tidal streams , satellites etc . )",
    "are closely coupled to the disk orientation .",
    "we employed simple rotating disk halo models to examine whether disk  like rotation is consistent with the observed galaxy  gas kinematics . for model parameters that allow for a 1 mpc gas scale height and maximum rotation velocity ( rigid rotation ) the the bulk of the observed absorption kinematics",
    "can be explained by co  rotation with the galaxy . in all cases ,",
    "the rotating disk halo models we present are unable reproduce the _ full _ spread of observed absorption velocities .",
    "this model is a highly unrealistic representation of galaxy gas . when the parameters are relaxed to better reflect reasonable gas scale heights and a slowing of the rotation speed with height above the disk plane , the relative proportion of the gas velocity spread that can be made consistent with galaxy co  rotation diminishes such that some absorbers can not have but a tiny fraction explained by co  rotation .",
    "in this simple scenario , even if some of the absorbing gas arises in a thick disk , what we learn from the exercise is that some additional type of dynamical process ( such as infall , outflow , supernovae winds , etc . ) must be invoked to explain the range of absorption velocities hat can not be made consistent with the simple rotating disk halo model .",
    "5 .   in two quasar fields , we find pairs of galaxies that align in velocity within @xmath411   of a single , saturated absorption system . for one case , the observed velocity range of the strong saturated component can be explained by a rotating disk model only if _ both _ galaxies contribute to the absorption .",

    "together , these structures extend roughly @xmath3  kpc around the galaxy , suggesting that galaxy `` halos '' are a complex composite of the these various structures . 7 .   for this simulated galaxy the covering fraction",
    "is @xmath412% , which is below the current observational estimated means of 2080% @xcite .",

    "these galaxies are below the detection limits of deep _ hst _ images . although ,",
    "the covering fractions of these dense regions are low , this might explain why some bright galaxies at dla redshifts are found at large impact parameters .",

    ", the majority of the absorbing gas is infalling in filaments and tidal streams towards the galaxy with velocities between @xmath4  . the velocity offset probability distribution ( relative to the simulated galaxy )",
    "spans @xmath5   with lowest probability of detecting at the galaxy systematic velocity .",
    "thus , observed absorption velocities can fall within the range of the galaxy rotation curve velocities , even though the gas arises in a variety of kinematics structures .",
    "the gas structures selected by in the simulations ( see figures  [ fig : eonh][fig : fonhi ] ) can not be described as simple thick disks or spherical halos .",
    "if the simulations reflect reality , it would appear that absorption arises in large @xmath413  kpc halos that are built from the local cosmological environment of a moderate mass galaxy .",
    "complicating the picture is the fact that we find groups and pairs of galaxies that align in velocity within @xmath411   of a single absorption system .",
    "this challenges the idea that an individual absorber can be assigned to a single galaxy or understood as an isolated halo .",
    "though considered subcomponents of halos , smaller scale structures like the magellanic - type galaxies and tidal streams , may contribute significantly to the detections of absorption @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead us to suggest that galaxies and absorbers should be studied and modeled in a environmental context if they are to be fully understood .    in the simulations , the kinematics",
    "are closely coupled to the gas structures ( i.e. , filaments , tidal streams , small satellite galaxies , and the inner 20  kpc of the central galaxy ) . as observed in our data , the simulated absorption velocities fall within the range of the galaxy rotation velocities , and rarely at the galaxy systematic velocity .",
    "thus , the simulations suggest that observing absorption velocities consistent with the galaxy rotation curves can naturally occur even if the absorption arises in many different structures in the complex environment of the galaxy .",
