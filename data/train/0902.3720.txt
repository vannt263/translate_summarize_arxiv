    "idea that inhomogeneous vortex tangle evolves in a diffusive - like manner appeared quite long ago .",
    "thus , the authors of paper @xcite , who observed the regions of  high vortex line densities @xmath4  plugs  in the channel with the counterflowing he ii proposed that this phenomenon appeared due to diffusion of quantity @xmath5 . an attempt to describe theoretically these processes",
    "was made by @xcite , and geurst89 , who proposed to introduce the term proportional @xmath6 into the vinen equation .",
    "authors were not able to restore the value of the diffusion coefficient from experiment ( these results are reviewed and discussed in @xcite ) . in series of works ( see @xcite and references therein ) both the diffusion process and the diffusion coefficient we obtained from the so called non equilibrium thermodynamics principles developed by the authors earlier . in paper tsub - diff  the spatial diffusion of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle  had been studied numerically ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .  analyzing their results the authors determined the diffusion constant to be of order of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the quantum of circulation ) .",
    "dynamics of the inhomogeneous vortex tangle had been studied numerically also in paper @xcite , however , since the authors studied the dilute tangle they observed the `` ballistic '' regime rather then pure diffusion .",
    "especial interest to the diffusion processes arises in context of the problem on decay of  the vortex tangle at zero ( extremely low ) temperature .",
    "indeed , the most apparent mechanism of dissipation in quantum fluids - the mutual friction between the vortices and the normal component -disappears . at the same time in a series of experimental works @xcite , pickett-2006,@xcite the decay of quantum turbulence is  observed , and the question arises what is the mechanism for dissipation at zero temperature . various approaches and ideas such as a cascade like break down of the loops , kelvin waves cascade , acoustic radiation , reconnection loss etc .",
    "have been discussed in details in recent review @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the vortex tangle speading with the subsequent degeneration is usually ignored .",
    "in fact , contibution of diffusion had been discussed in the cited experimental work , but grounding on the value @xmath9 for the diffusion constant ,  the authors concluded that this small diffusion coefficient did not lead to correct time of decay . in the present paper",
    "we develop the theory describing the evolution of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle on the bases of kinetics of the merging and breaking down vortex loops .",
    "we showed that evolution of a weakly inhomogeneous vortex tangle obeys the diffusion equation with the coefficient equal to adout @xmath10 , which exceeds approximately twentyfold as large the value obtained in @xcite .",
    "we present arguments that the diffusion constant would be significantly underestimated in @xcite due to especial procedure used by the authors .",
    "we used the diffusion equation to describe the decay of the vortex tangle at very low temperature .",
    "comparison with the recent experiments on decay of the superfluid turbulence @xcite,@xcite,@xcite is made .",
    "vortex loops composing the vortex tangle can move as a whole with some drift velocity @xmath11 depending on their structure and their length .",
    "the flux of the line length , energy , momentum etc .",
    ", executed by the moving vortex loops takes place . in the case of inhomogeneous vortex tangle the net flux due to gradient of concentration of",
    "the vortex line density appears .",
    "situation here is exactly the same as in classical kinetic theory with the difference that the `` carriers '' are not the point particles but the extended objects ( vortex loops ) , which possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom with very involved dynamics .",
    "in addition , while collision ( or self - intersection ) of elements of filaments the so called reconnection of the lines occurs , and loops either merge or split , losing their individuality  and turning into other loops .",
    "the full statement of this problem requires some analog of the secondary quantization method for extended objects , or the string field theory , the problem of incredible complexity .",
    "clearly , this problem can be hardly resolved in the nearest future . some approach crucially reducing the number of degrees of freedom",
    "is required .",
    "we offer to fulfill investigation basing on supposition that vortex loops have the brownian structure ( see @xcite ) .  in accordance with this approach",
    "the average loop can be imagined as consisting of many arches with the mean radius of curvature equal @xmath12 randomly ( but smoothly ) connected to each other .",
    "quantity @xmath12 is important parameter of the approach .",
    "it plays a role of the `` elementary step '' in the theory of polymer .",
    "it is low cut - off of the approach developed , the theory does not describe scales smaller then @xmath12 .",
    "statistics of brownian loops is described by the generalized wiener distribution with the only parameter @xmath12 for all loops .",
    "thus we consider the vortex tangle as a collection of vortex loops of various lengths @xmath0 , which is only degree of freedom .",
    "let us introduce distribution function @xmath1 of the density of a loop in the space  of their lengths .",
    "it is defined as the number of loops ( per unit volume ) with lengths lying between @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "knowing quantity @xmath1 and statistics of each personal loop we are able to evaluate various properties of real vortex tangle .",
    "the distribution function @xmath1 obeys the boltzmann type `` kinetic '' equation .",
    "study of exact solution to this `` kinetic '' equation allowed us to develop  a theory of superfluid turbulence , which quantitatively describes the main features of this phenomenon nemirprl2006,@xcite .",
    "this approach turns out to be useful for the study of inhomogeneous vortex tangle . in this case",
    "we have to impose the coordinate dependence on the distribution function and on parameter @xmath12 , that is to put @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and to modify the `` kinetic '' equation with regard to inhomogeneous situation .",
    "in fact , in this work we restrict ourselves to a bit more modest problem , namely we study the question of the spatial and temporal evolution of the vortex line density @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding theory can be developed in spirit of the classical  kinetic theory with the difference  that the transport processes are executed with the extended objects - vortex loops .",
    "accordingly the key questions is to evaluate the drift velocity @xmath11 and the free path for the loop of size @xmath0 .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath11 is defined via an averaged quadratic velocity of the line elements ( simple average velocity vanishes due to symmetry ) @xmath17the averaging @xmath18 should be done with use of the gaussian model briefly described above @xcite .",
    "the result of according calculations is that @xmath19 .",
    "quantity @xmath20 is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the core radius and @xmath23 is a constant about unity .",
    "velocity @xmath11 can be also estimated from the following qualitative consideration . consequently considering the average loop as consisting of @xmath24 arches with the mean radius of curvature equal to @xmath12 randomly ( but smoothly ) connected to each other , we take its velocity as the resulting velocity of all arches composing the loop . since the arches randomly connected to each other , and",
    "have the _ _  _ _ velocity as for rings _ _ , _ _ @xmath25 ( directed along the normal ) , the resulting averaged velocity is the `` random walking '' average , @xmath26 .",
    "the drift motion is realized until the loops collide with other loops with subsequent formation of larger loops .",
    "number of collisions @xmath27 per small interval @xmath28 can be estimated from the `` kinetic equation '' for the distribution function @xmath29 of density of loops in space of their lengths @xmath30 ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the rate of change of density @xmath29 due to collisions is@xmath31we omit the processes of the loops breakdown due to the self - intersection .",
    "the reason is that the migration of loops is performed mainly by small loops , the large ones undergo reconnections without any essential drift .",
    "the scattering cross - section @xmath32 describes the rate ( number of events per unit volume and unit time ) of collision of two loops with lengths @xmath0 and @xmath33 and forming the loop of length @xmath34 .",
    "it is evaluated in papers @xcite  @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the numerical factor approximately equal to @xmath37 and @xmath11 @xmath38 is the velocity of approaching of vortex line elements ( similar result for quantity @xmath39 was obtained qualitatively in the context of cosmic strings @xcite ) .",
    "then probability @xmath27 for loop to collide with other loops ( and reconnect ) in small interval @xmath40 is :    @xmath41    where quantity @xmath42 is evaluated with the use of relation ( ke_part ) @xmath43we calculate the collision probability @xmath42 with the use of  the distribution function @xmath29 , obtained early @xmath44 ( see nemirprl2006,@xcite ) . here",

    "the procedure is very close to the one made in the classical kinetic theory with the difference that the carriers have different sizes , this requires additional integration over the loop lengths .     and orientated perpendicularly to axis @xmath51,width=188 ]",
    "let us consider the small area element placed at some point @xmath51 and orientated perpendicularly to axis @xmath51 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the @xmath51-component flux of the line length executed by loops of sizes @xmath0 placed in @xmath54 direction ( from the left and right sides , correspondingly ) and remote from the area element at distance @xmath55 can be written as @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "the net is@xmath58taking that spacial density of the loops is the function of coordinate @xmath51 ( i.e. @xmath59 ) we obtain after simple integration @xmath60 .",

    "ii).quantity @xmath61  is independent variable , which can appear , when the own vortex line ( kelvin wave propagation ) dynamics prevails collisions of loop , determining thereby the structure of the vortex tangle . in this case the mean radius of curvature @xmath12 should be connected to spectrum of kelvin waves@xcite iii ) .",
    "mean curvature @xmath62 and vortex line dinsity @xmath63 are not independent , the relation between these two quantaties appears due to the balancing of fusion and splitting of the loops and can be determined from the `` kinetic '' equation nemirprl2006 , it is @xmath64 .",
    "the fact that the interline space is of the order of the mean radius of curvature had been firstly discovered numerically in @xcite . using this connection we come to conclusion that @xmath65 and correspondingly",
    ", the spatial - temporal evolution of quantity @xmath46 obeys the diffusion type equation@xmath66    where the diffusion coefficient @xmath67 is equal @xmath68 .",
    "our approach is fairly crude to claim for good quantitative description .",
    "however , if to adopt the data grounded on exact solution  to the boltzmann type `` kinetic '' equation ( @xcite ) we conclude that @xmath69 . as it was discussed above",
    ", the result that evolution of vld obeys the diffusion type equation with the diffusion constant of order of @xmath8 is expected .",
    "the actual interest is connected to prefactor @xmath70 .",
    "early , the only quantitative result was obtained numerically by tsubota et al . , and it was @xmath71 , in @xmath72 times smaller .",
    "we will discuss the probable reason for this large discrepancy later .",
    "to construct the boundary conditions we have to state the problem specifically .",
    "smearing of the tangle .",
    "let us consider , first , the case when the vortex tangle is placed in some restricted domain of superfluid helium .",
    "let us consider also that vortex line density @xmath46 is not too high ,  this allows the relatively large loop to be radiated .",
    "they move slowly , the smaller loops run down larger loop , then collide and reconnect with them .",
    "so , outside of initial domain the well developed tangle is formed .",
    "this , secondary , vortex tangle smoothly joins the initial tangle inside the domain .",
    "this implies that in this case no boundary conditions are required at all , and evolution of the vortex line density obeys equation ( diffusion equation ) in infinite space with initial distribution @xmath73 inside this domain .",
    "radiation of loops .",
    "the second situation can be realized when the radiated vortex loops run away does not influence the initial vortex tangle .",
    "it can happen , for instance if the initial tangle is very dense , so it can radiate only very small loops , which propagate rapidly .",
    "these loops run away without interaction with each other and with initial tangle where they are radiated from .",
    "other hypothetic variant appears when there is some trap on the boundary absorbing vortex loops .",
    "thus the vortex loops escaped from the initial domain do not influence on the original vortex tangle . in both case",
    "the boundary conditions can be found assuming that diffusive like flux of length near boundary @xmath74 coincides with the flux executed by vortex loops radiated through the ( right ) boundary @xmath75 .",
    "the latter is evaluated by small modernization of ( [ net flux ] )    @xmath76    contribution due to remote loops ( term @xmath77 in argument for @xmath78 ) is evaluated as early giving obvious result @xmath79 .",
    "to evaluate contribution from the first one @xmath80 * *  * * we use again solution @xmath81 and relation ( [ probability(x ) ] ) . simple calculation lead to result that flux @xmath80 of length due to evaporation ( radiation ) is @xmath82with @xmath83 the sum of @xmath84  and @xmath85 gives the flux through the boundary , which has to be equal to @xmath86 at the boundary .",
    "then we finally have the following boundary condition @xmath87    \\3 .",
    "solid walls . in case of solid wall which corresponds to some experiments",
    "the situation is more involved .",
    "vortices can annihilate on the solid wall , they can undergo pinning and depinning radiating vortices back to the bulk of helium .",
    "surely this requires a special treatment which goes beyond the scope of the work .",
    "one the possible ways is to consider the solid wall as a `` partial '' trap , which catches the loops and re - emits a part of them back into the volume .",
    "formally it can be written as condition ( [ nbc ] ) with additional term @xmath88 describing the back flux . without detailed analysis",
    "it can be supposed that the back flux is proportional to the vortex line density on boundary @xmath89 with coefficient @xmath90 depending on dynamics of line on the wall ( jumps between pinning sites , kelvin waves dynamics near the wall etc . ) . thus the boundary condition can be written in form.@xmath91",
    "let us discuss the question how the approach developed can be applied to the problem of decay of the vortex tangle at zero temperature . as it was discussed in the introduction , the contribution of diffusion ( or radiation of loops ) is usually ignored , mainly due to smallness of the diffusion constant offered in paper by tsubota et all @xcite .",
    "let us examine this work more thoroughly .",
    "in paper @xcite  there was studied one - dimensional evolution ( spacial spreading ) of the vortex tangle concentrated initially in some domain of space and having nonuniform distribution there as it is depicted in the first picture in fig .",
    "3 .     and with theauxiliary term @xmath92 , ( tsubota et , al .",
    "@xcite , width=264 ]    in the rest pictures distribution of the vld at different moments of time is shown .  to describe this evolution of the vld",
    "it had  been supposed that quantity @xmath3 obeys equation ( [ diffusion equation ] ) with additional term @xmath93 in the right hand side . in turn",
    "this term was introduced to describe the decay of the vortex tangle in previous numerical simulation made by tsubota et al .",
    "_ because of this additional term contribution of diffusion to the whole decay would be significantly underestimated .",
    "_ we would like to note that there is possible to choose another reasoning , namely , to consider that decay of the vortex tangle in both cited works occurs mainly by the diffusion process ( with the diffusion coefficient calculated in the present work ) .",
    "we calculated spatial -temporal evolution of vortex tangle ( under condition of numerical experiment by tsubota et al . ) with the use of equation ( [ diffusion equation ] ) results depicted in fig .",
    "4 .  enables us to conclude that the approach developed describes satisfactory the evolution of vortex tangle without any additional supposition .    ) without ani auxiliary term , the diffusion constant is equal to @xmath94.,width=302 ]    thus , we demonstrated that evolution of the vortex line density in numerical experiment @xcite can be described in terms of pure diffusion of the vortex tangle with the diffusion coefficient @xmath95 .",
    "let us now discuss two recent experiments on decay of the voretx tangle at very small temperature @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors reported attenuation of vortex line density in superfluid turbulent helium , ( @xmath96he - b in paper @xcite and @xmath97he in paper @xcite ) .",
    "they attribute the decay of the vortex tangle to the classical turbulence mechanisms .  without discussion of this variant",
    "we would like just to estimate the contribution into attenuation of the vortex line density due to the pure diffusion mechanism .    in the upper picture of fig .",
    "5 we displayed the fig 2 .",
    "of work pickett-2006 showing results of measurements on the temporal behavior of the average vortex line density @xmath98 ( solid curves , see for details @xcite ) . in the lower picture of fig .",
    "5 we depicted the evolution the same quantity ( for initial condition @xmath99 ) due to diffusion process described in the present paper .",

    "was created in the cubic container with solid boundaries .",
    "therefore we had chosen the third type boundary condition with the fitting parameter @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    ", width=188 ]    in particular , there is some plateau anticipatory decay of the tangle .",
    "full decay of the tangle occurs in time of the order of few thousands seconds as it was observed in experiments .",
    "the slope of curve in interval of  most intensive decrease shows the dependence close to @xmath103 ( the straight line , its position coinsides with position of the straight line in upper picture ) .",
    "thus , there is again very good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions.there is one very interesting by - product of the consideration exposed above .",
    "it is easy to notice that for small values of vortex line density the bend appears on curve @xmath104 .",
    "it corresponds to the fact that the diffusive - like flux of the length vanishes ( because of vanishing the gradient @xmath105)@xmath106  and the only first and third terms in the boundary condition ( [ re - emission ] ) survive .",
    "let us recall that these terms correspond to radiation of loops from the bulk to the boundary and to the re - emission of loops from the wall into bulk of helium . comparing this terms ( for the chosen value @xmath101 @xmath102 ) we obtain that equilibrium",
    "is reached for value of the vortex line density @xmath46 of order @xmath107  @xmath108 .",
    "this value can be considered as a `` background '' value of pre - existing vortices in helium",
    "in summary , the theory describing evolution of inhomogeneous vortex tangle at zero temperature was developed on the bases of kinetics of merging and splitting vortex loops . using the gaussian model for vortex loops we calculated the ( size dependent ) free path and mean quadratic velocity of vortex loops . with the use of these quantities we calculated the flux of the vortex line density @xmath3 in inhomogeneous vortex tangle and demonstrated that under certain circumstances it satisfies to the diffusion like equation with the coefficient equal approximately to @xmath10 .",
    "we used this equation to describe the decay of the vortex tangle at very low temperature .",
    "we compare solution with the recent experiments on decay of the superfluid turbulence .",
    "the good agreement with the experimental data allowed us to conclude that the diffusion processes give the significant contribution in the free decay of the vortex tangle at absence of normal component .",
