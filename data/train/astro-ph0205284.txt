    "attempts to determine the statistics of intensity and polarization fluctuations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) renewed interest to the fluctuations of galactic foreground radiation ( see tegmark et al .  2000 ) .",
    "spectra of intensity of synchrotron emission and synchrotron polarization ( see papers in de oliveira - costa & tegmark 1999 ) as well as starlight polarization ( fosalba et al . 2002 ; henceforth flpt ) have been measured .",
    "those measurements revealed a range of power - laws , the origin of which has not been addressed as far as we know . in tegmark",
    "et al .  ( 2000 ) there is an allusion that the spectra may be relevant to kolmogorov turbulence , but the issue of how those different spectra may arise has not been addressed .",
    "interstellar medium is turbulent and kolmogorov - type spectra were reported on the scales from several au to several kpc ( see armstrong et al .",
    "1995 ; lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ) .",
    "therefore it is natural to think of the turbulence as the origin of the fluctuations of the diffuse foreground radiation .",
    "interstellar medium is magnetized with magnetic field making turbulence anisotropic .",
    "it may be argued that although the spectrum of mhd turbulence exhibits scale - dependent anisotropy if studied in the system of reference defined by the local magnetic field ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; lithwick & goldreich 2001 ; cho & lazarian 2002 ) , in the observer s system of reference the spectrum will show only moderate scale - independent anisotropy .",
    "thus from the observer s point of view kolmogorov description of interstellar turbulence is acceptable in spite of the fact that magnetic field is dynamically important and even dominant ( see discussion in lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002 ) .",
    "it is customary for cmb studies to expand the foreground intensity over spherical harmonics @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and write the spectrum in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the measurements indicate that angular power spectra ( @xmath3 ) of the galactic emission follows power law ( @xmath4 ) ( see flpt and references in  3 ) .",
    "this paper tests whether the measured spectra are compatible with the theoretical predictions of spatial statistics that is expected in the presence of mhd turbulence .",
    "analytical studies in this direction were done in lazarian ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) and here we supplement them with numerical simulations of the synthetic spectra .",
    "in this section we show that , when the angle between the lines of sight is small ( i.e.  @xmath5 ) , the angular spectrum @xmath3 has the same slope as the 3-dimensional energy spectrum of turbulence . here",
    "@xmath6 is the typical size of the largest energy containing eddies , which is sometime called as outer scale of turbulence or energy injection scale , and @xmath7 is the distance to the farthest eddies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_all]a ) . to illustrate the problem consider the observations with lines of sight being parallel .",
    "the observed intensity is the intensity summed along the _ line of sight _ , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 rearranging the order of summation and using @xmath10 , we get @xmath11 which means fourier component of @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "when the angular size of the observed region ( @xmath14 in radian ) on the sky is small , @xmath3 is approximately the ` energy ' spectrum of @xmath15 ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ; hobson & majueijo 1996 ; seljak 1997 ) , which means @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the analysis of the geometry of crossing lines of sight is more involved , but for power - law statistics it follows from lazarian & shutenkov ( 1990 ) that if @xmath19 , then the ` energy ' spectrum of @xmath15 is also @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath21 in the small @xmath22 limit from the observation of the correlation function @xmath23 in real space ( or @xmath24 on the sky ) . when the three - dimensional spectrum of turbulence follows a power law ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "however , when the slope of the turbulence spectrum is steeper than @xmath28 , this relation breaks down and @xmath29 regardless of the turbulence slope .",
    "when we infer @xmath3 from this @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath30 regardless of the true slope , when the slope is steeper than @xmath31 . ] .    for kolmogorov turbulence ( @xmath32 )",
    ", we expect @xmath33 note that @xmath34 .      following lazarian & shutenkov ( 1990 )",
    ", we can show that the correlation function for @xmath35 , @xmath36 where we change variables : @xmath37 is clear from fig .",
    "1b ; we accounted for the jacobian of which is @xmath38 .",
    "we can understand @xmath39 behavior qualitatively from fig .",
    "when the angle is large , points along of the lines - of - sight near the observer are still correlated .",
    "these points extend from the observer over the distance @xmath40 .    in the limit of @xmath41",
    "we get the angular power spectrum @xmath3 using fourier transform : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the bessel function , and we use @xmath45 .    in summary , for kolmogorov turbulence , we expect from equations ( [ eq_5 ] ) and ( [ eq_7 ] ) that @xmath46 which means that the power index @xmath47 of @xmath3 is . ]",
    "the critical number @xmath49 depends on the size of the size of the large turbulent eddies and on the direction of the observation .",
    "if in the naive model we assume that turbulence is homogeneous along the lines of sight and has @xmath50 corresponding to a typical size of the supernova remnant for disk with @xmath51  kpc , we get @xmath52 . for the synchrotron halo , @xmath53  kpc ( see smoot 1999 ) and we get @xmath54 .",
    "recent statistical studies of _ total _ synchrotron intensity include haslam all - sky map at 408 mhz that shows that the power index @xmath47 is in the range between 2.5 and 3 ( tegmark & efstathiou 1996 ; bouchet , gispert , & puget 1996 ) .",
    "parkes southern galactic plane survey at 2.4 ghz suggests shallower slope : giardino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained @xmath55 after point source removal and baccigalupi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained @xmath56 to @xmath57 . using rhodes / hartrao data at 2326 mhz , giardino et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained @xmath58 for all - sky data and @xmath59 for high galactic latitude regions with @xmath60 .",
    "the rough tendency that follow from these data is that @xmath47 which is close to @xmath61 for the galactic plane gets steeper ( to @xmath62 ) for higher latitudes . in other words",
    "@xmath63 which differs from naive expectations given by equation ( [ eq_1_11_3 ] ) .    can the difference be due to non - linear law of synchrotron emissivity ?",
    "for synchrotron radiation , emissivity at a point @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the electron number density , @xmath67 is the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the index @xmath68 is approximately @xmath61 for radio synchrotron frequencies ( see smoot 1999 ) . if electrons are uniformly distributed over the scales of magnetic field inhomogeneities , the spectrum of intensity reflects the statistics of magnetic field . for small amplitude perturbations ( @xmath69 ;",
    "this is true for scales several times smaller than @xmath6 when we interpret @xmath70 as local mean magnetic field strength ) , if @xmath71 has a power - law behavior , the statistics of intensity will have the same power - law behavior ( see deshpande et al .",
    "therefore emissivity non - linearity does not account for the difference between the observed spectra and the theoretical expectations .    to address the problem",
    ", we perform simple numerical calculations for galactic disk and halo .",
    "we obtain @xmath3 using the relation @xmath72 we use gauss - legendre quadrature integration ( see szapudi et al .",
    "2001 for its application to cmb ) to obtain @xmath3 .",
    "we numerically calculate the angular correlation function from @xmath73 where @xmath74 and assume that the spatial correlation function @xmath23 follow kolmogorov statistics : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a constant .",
    "[ fig_all]c and fig .",
    "[ fig_all]d illustrate the agreement of our calculations with the theoretical expectations within the naive model of the disk and the halo from the previous section .    to make the spectrum closer to observations we need to consider more realistic models .",
    "first , synchrotron emission is stronger in spiral arms , and therefore we have more synchrotron emission coming from the nearby regions .",
    "second , if synchrotron disk component is sufficiently thin , then lines of sight are not equivalent and effectively nearby disk component contributes more .",
    "indeed , when we observe regions with low galactic latitude , the effective line - of - sight varies with galactic latitude .",
    "suppose we observe a region with @xmath77 .",
    "then emission from @xmath78 is substantially weaker than that from @xmath79 , because the region with @xmath78 is @xmath80 above the galactic plane and , therefore , has weak emission . to incorporate this effect",
    ", we use the weighting function @xmath81 , which gives more weight on closer distance .",
    "the resulting angular power spectrum ( fig .  [ fig_all]e ) shows a slope similar to -2 .    for halo",
    ", the simple model predicts that @xmath82 , but observations provide somewhat less steep spectra .",
    "is this discrepancy very significant ?",
    "the spectrum of magnetic field is expected to be shallower than @xmath83 in the vicinity of the energy injection scale and at the vicinity of the magnetic equipartition scale .",
    "the observed spectrum also gets shallower if @xmath7 gets larger .",
    "for instance beuermann , kanbach , & berkhuijsen ( 1985 ) reported the existence of thick radio halo that extends to more than @xmath84 near the sun .",
    "finally , filamentary structures and point sources can make the spectrum shallower as well .",
    "further research should establish the true reason for the discrepancy .",
    "polarized radiation from dust is an important component of galactic foreground that strongly interferes with intended cmb polarization measurements ( see lazarian & prunet 2001 ) .",
    "flpt attempted to predict the spectrum of the polarized foreground from dust and obtained @xmath85 for starlight polarization .",
    "this spectrum is different from those discussed in the previous sections . to relate this spectrum to the underlying turbulence we should account for the following facts : a ) the observations are done for the disk component of the galaxy , b ) the sampled stars are at different distances from the observer with most of the stars close - by .    to deal with this problem we use numerical simulations again .",
    "we first generate a three ( i.e.  _ x , y _ , and _ z _ ) components of magnetic field on a two - dimensional plane ( @xmath86 grid points representing @xmath87 ) , using the following kolmogorov three - dimensional spectrum : @xmath88 if @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "our results show that how we continuously extend the spectrum for @xmath91 does not change our results .    to simulate the actual distribution of stars within the sample used in flpt , we scatter our emission sources using the following probability distribution function : @xmath92 the starlight polarization is due to the difference in absorption cross section of non - spherical grains aligned with their longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field ( see review by lazarian 2000 ) . in numerical calculations we approximate the actual turbulent magnetic field by a superposition of the slabs with locally uniform magnetic field in each slap and assume that the difference in grain absorption parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field results in the 10% difference in the optical depths @xmath93 and @xmath94 for a slab .",
    "we calculate evolution of stocks parameters of the starlight within the slab and use the standard transforms of stocks parameters from one slab to another ( dolginov , gnedin , & silantev 1996 ; see similar expressions in martin 1972 ) .",
    "we show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig_all]f . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the degree of polarization assuming all stars are at the same distance of @xmath95 .",
    "the result shows that , for a mixture of nearby and faraway stars , the slope steepens and gets very close to the observed one , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "our conclusions may be tested if stars at particular distance only are correlated . if those stars are nearby , we would expect to have steeper index and it will become shallow if only distant stars are chosen .",
    "choosing only nearby stars we expect to get a steeper index .",
    "a systematic study of this change can provide an estimate of the energy injection scale @xmath6 . from the point of view of foreground studies , we conclude that a naive use of the polarization template produced with the random sample of stars may be misleading .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the origin of spatial fluctuations of emissivity and polarization of galactic diffuse emission .",
    "we have shown that mhd turbulence can qualitatively explain observed properties of total synchrotron emission and starlight polarization .",
    "the variety of measured spatial spectra of synchrotron emission can be explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of emissivity , structure of galactic disk and halo , and/or various energy injection scales .",
    "similarly , mhd turbulence plus inhomogeneous distribution of stars can explain the reported scaling of starlight polarization statistics .    evidently more systematic studies are required .",
    "those studies will not only give insight into how to separate cmb from foregrounds , but also would provide valuable information on the structure of interstellar medium and the sources / energy injection scales of interstellar turbulence .",
