    "the mandelbrot set @xmath3 generation relates , in the original experiment , to a given non - linear and one - parameter map @xmath4 where both @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the complex parameter ranging over the whole @xmath7 .",
    "the key concept of this experiment refers back to early fatou s and julia s ideas on testing julia set connectivity under perturbations of the parameter @xmath6 , as well as on their renown theorem of existence of one critical point @xmath8 in any basin of attraction and the concept of ` post - critical ' set be the set of critical points for @xmath9 .",
    "it is the closure of all forward orbits @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . ] , revealing so helpful today to explore several properties in the dynamics of complex maps .",
    "let @xmath1 be the seed at the critical point of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath4 is iterated per each @xmath6 .",
    "one associates each resulting orbit @xmath13 to a connected or disconnected julia set , if @xmath13 is bounded or not respectively , so that @xmath6 may belong or not to @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath3 can be intended as a chart of julia sets connectivity , compiled and drawn in the @xmath14parameter space .",
    "what does it happen to @xmath3 as @xmath1 is perturbed and it lies no longer at @xmath8 ?",
    "the question here posed was previously introduced in section  6.3 of @xcite , where , in the course of related experiments , we noticed that the connectivity of the mandelbrot set @xmath3 , for the classic quaternionic iterator @xmath15 @xmath16 , breaks as the seed @xmath17 of each orbit is distinct from the critical point ( in this case at the origin ) .",
    "anyway the interpretation of figures with solid 3-d models for the quaternionic julia sets looks very hard to evince the question here posed ; therefore we moved to the more simply looking environment @xmath7 , where figures are displayed quite clearer .",
    "the still open mlc ( standing for ` mandelbrot locally connected ' ) conjecture states that the mandelbrot set @xmath3 is locally connected , every neighborhood of @xmath18 includes a connected open neighborhood .",
    "] , roughly speaking , the set includes no uni - dimensional filaments .",
    "these pages want to enjoy an empirical flavor exclusively , i.e. no mathematics is achieved and any goal or pretension to deep into the theory is disclaimed .",
    "we will not dare into the proof of it for sure , because we are not skilled enough for that .",
    "this is just a communication collecting a bunch of figures processed by playing with the seed @xmath1 .",
    "two journeys are shown : given @xmath19 , we let @xmath6 range along the real @xmath20 $ ] and the imaginary segment @xmath21 $ ] respectively , where @xmath3 is more visible .",
    "we noticed that as far as one runs away from the origin ( @xmath22 for @xmath0 ) along both real and imaginary directions , @xmath3 loses progressively connectivity in the peripheral regions , while the central cardioid is deformed , shrinking again and again .",
    "if the seed is very close to the critical point , disconnectivity is hardly noticed because only the most marginal periphery of @xmath3 is notched ; but , as one moves farther from @xmath8 , the disconnectivity rate increases , even the cardiod is deformed and more evident figures are displayed .",
    "we liked to give some ( nave , maybe ) impressions : one could try to attack the mlc conjecture by an inverse approach , that is , proving that @xmath3 is always disconnected when the seed , for each orbit in the @xmath3 experiment for @xmath0 is not at the origin , according to the original experiment .",
    "does the connectivity of @xmath3 depend on @xmath1 at the critical point ?",
    "if so , one would try to determine , if possible , a sort of _ disconnectivity rate _ decreasing to @xmath23 along any path leading to the critical point of the given function @xmath9 .",
    "thus , on one hand , we pull out the evidence , from the next figures , that @xmath3 is not connected for seeds not lying at the critical point ; on the other hand , from the known figure of @xmath3 ( see fig . [ pic00 ] ) , it seems to be locally connected .",
    "perhaps , things may match together .",
    "my intention here is just to suggest an idea , an attack to mlc and know if it might work or not or where it might lead somewhere . in some cases ,",
    "like jacobi s for elliptic integrals , the history of mathematics showed that an inverted look - up at the problem helped . who knows whether the above considerations could actually work ?",
    "without addressing to audience , one would never check it .",
    "the next images are snapshots from a couple of animations we made , downloadable from our site and showing how @xmath3 shifts its shape when the seed @xmath24 , like in the original experiment ."
