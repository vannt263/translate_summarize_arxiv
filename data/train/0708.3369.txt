    "let @xmath4 be a commutative noetherian ring , and let @xmath0 and @xmath5 be two proper ideals of height @xmath6 in @xmath4 .",
    "these ideals are said to be _ directly linked if there exists a regular sequence @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we say @xmath0 and @xmath5 are in the same _ linkage class ( or _ liaison class ) if there exists a sequence of ideals @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is directly linked to @xmath12 for @xmath13 , the case @xmath14 being referred to as _",
    "double linkage_. such a sequence of links connecting @xmath0 and @xmath5 is far from unique .",
    "we call the ideal @xmath0 _ licci if @xmath0 is in the * li*nkage * c*lass of a * c*omplete * i*ntersection , i.e. , of an ideal generated by a regular sequence . _ _ _ _    let @xmath0 be a homogeneous ideal of @xmath15 $ ] , a polynomial ring over a field with the standard grading . in considering the linkage class of @xmath0 one must distinguish between allowing only homogeneous links , i.e. , links where all the regular sequences are homogeneous , and non - homogeneous linkage .",
    "the corresponding linkage classes are not a priori the same . in trying to understand homogeneous linkage ,",
    "an obviously critical question to address is to understand the sequence of links by which a homogeneously licci ideal is in the liaison class of a complete intersection . in the local case , in @xcite",
    "it was shown that if an ideal @xmath0 in a gorenstein local ring with infinite residue field is licci , then one can pick regular sequences consisting of general combinations of minimal generators at every step to reach a complete intersection . a corresponding question for homogeneous linkage would ask",
    "if @xmath0 is homogeneously licci , then can it be linked to a complete intersection by linking using regular sequences of forms of smallest possible degree at each step ? in this paper we answer this question in the negative .",
    "since homogeneous linkage by a regular sequence of minimal possible degree will be the chief topic of this paper , we give it a name ; we say that @xmath0 is _ directly minimally homogeneously linked _ to an ideal @xmath5 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is generated by a regular sequence in @xmath0 of smallest possible degree .",
    "note that contrary to usual linkage , this is not necessarily a symmetric relation !",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ minimally homogeneously licci _ if @xmath0 is homogeneously licci and all the links in a linkage sequence from @xmath0 to a complete intersection can be taken to be direct minimal homogeneous links .",
    "( of course , this does not mean _ all paths from @xmath0 to a complete intersection are minimal linkages . ) _",
    "intuitively , it seems that all homogeneously licci ideals should be minimally homogeneously licci , as is the case in height @xmath19 .",
    "however , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "61 - 62 ) an example was announced of a homogeneously licci ideal which is not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "an @xmath20-primary homogeneous ideal @xmath0 with h - vector @xmath21 was constructed which is homogeneously licci , and it was claimed that it is not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "however , no proof was given for this assertion .",
    "we began the present paper in an attempt to understand this example . in section 2",
    "we will give examples of three ideals , each with h - vector @xmath21 , such that one of them is not licci , one is minimally homogeneously licci , and the last is homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "although none of these examples is the one from @xcite ( which was level , while ours are not ) , they show that no argument based only on the hilbert function can distinguish such ideals . in the last two examples , even the graded betti numbers are the same .",
    "this proves that there is no way to distinguish homogeneously licci and minimally homogeneously licci ideals by only using their graded betti numbers . at this point",
    ", we do not know whether there exist two homogeneous ideals with the same graded betti numbers , one homogeneously licci and the other not .",
    "in our last section we go much farther : we prove that for any @xmath22 and @xmath23 there exist reduced subschemes of degree @xmath2 and codimension three in @xmath24 , for @xmath25 an infinite field , that are homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci . moreover ,",
    "these subschemes can be taken to be finite unions of reduced linear subspaces .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath26 there exist sets of @xmath2 @xmath25-rational points in @xmath27 that are homogeneously licci , but are not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "the examples given are quite explicit , and suggest that this phenomenon is in fact very common .",
    "finally , by taking hypersurface sections , we show that in any codimension @xmath28 there are reduced subschemes that are homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "related results for gorenstein liaison recently have been given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is still conceivable that every homogeneously licci ideal can be linked to a complete intersection by using only homogeneous regular sequences that are part of a minimal homogeneous generating set of the respective ideals .",
    "for unexplained terminology we refer to the book of eisenbud , @xcite , while for additional information on liaison we refer to @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the referee of this article for a careful reading and many insightful comments .",
    "in this section we give three examples of @xmath20-primary homogeneous ideals , all with hilbert function @xmath21 , which exhibit different behavior in terms of their linkage classes .",
    "one is not licci at all , one is minimally homogeneously licci , and the third is homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "the third example takes considerably more work .",
    "we begin by establishing some notation . we will always write @xmath29 $ ] for a polynomial ring over a field @xmath25 and @xmath20 for its homogeneous maximal ideal @xmath30 . if @xmath0 is a homogeneous ideal , we let @xmath31 denote the ideal generated by all forms of degree at most @xmath32 in @xmath0",

    "the second example was easily verified by a straightforward calculation .",
    "however , the ease of proving the second example belies the difficulty in finding it .",
    "we needed to find a licci ideal with the given hilbert function where a certain koszul relation on the generators is minimal .",
    "the latter feature is crucial in the construction , as it causes betti numbers to decrease under double linkage .",
    "our last example is more delicate , requiring an understanding of how the heights of ideals generated by forms of low degree change in the linkage class of the ideal .",

    "we first prove that @xmath0 is homogeneously licci by direct computation .",

    "the claims concerning the hilbert function of @xmath0 and the resolution of @xmath0 are easy to check on any computer algebra program .",
    "the remainder of the proof is to show that @xmath0 is not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "we consider any @xmath20-primary homogeneous ideal @xmath97 in @xmath77 $ ] satisfying condition @xmath98 ; by this latter condition we mean that @xmath97 contains a homogeneous regular sequence of degrees @xmath96 and has a ( not necessarily minimal ) homogeneous free resolution of the form @xmath99    the ideal @xmath0 satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "also notice that any ideal satisfying @xmath98 requires @xmath100 generators , hence can not be a complete intersection or directly homogeneously linked to a complete intersection .",
    "we are going to prove that any minimal homogeneous double link reproduces condition @xmath98 .",
    "therefore no ideal satisfying @xmath98 can be minimally homogeneously licci .",

    "we first prove that @xmath101 , the subideal of @xmath97 generated by all forms of degree at most @xmath102 , has height at most @xmath19 . indeed",
    "if @xmath101 has height three , then @xmath101 contains an ideal @xmath18 generated by a homogeneous regular sequence of degrees @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath25-dimension of @xmath104 is @xmath105 . on the other hand",
    "the resolution of @xmath97 shows that the @xmath25-dimension of @xmath106 is at most @xmath107 .",
    "this contradiction proves that @xmath101 has height at most two .",
    "thus the smallest degrees of a homogeneous regular sequence contained in @xmath97 is @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a link of @xmath97 using a homogeneous regular sequence of degrees @xmath96 .",
    "we obtain its resolution from ferrand s mapping cone construction ( cf .",
    "since @xmath96 are the minimal possible degrees of a homogeneous regular sequence inside @xmath97 , any such regular sequence is part of a minimal homogeneous generating set of @xmath97 ; in particular , we can assume that this regular sequence appears in the generating set given by the above resolution of @xmath97 .",
    "this accounts for splitting , in the mapping cone , of @xmath108 .",
    "thus we obtain the following ( not necessarily minimal ) homogeneous free resolution of @xmath5 : @xmath109 if @xmath96 are again the minimal degrees of a homogeneous regular sequence contained in @xmath5 , then linking once more we reproduce an ideal satisfying condition @xmath98 as asserted .",
    "otherwise @xmath5 contains a homogeneous regular sequence of degrees @xmath103 .",
    "linking @xmath5 with respect to such a complete intersection would lead to this minimal homogeneous free resolution of the linked ideal @xmath110 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "since the two linearly independent quadrics in @xmath110 must have exactly one generating syzygy , it follows that @xmath114 , hence @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath116 is generated by these two quadrics .",
    "furthermore , having a nontrivial cubic relation , the two quadrics are forced to have a linear factor in common .",
    "we conclude that @xmath116 has height one and hence can not contain two cubics forming a regular sequence",
    ". thus there exists no homogeneous regular sequence of degrees @xmath103 inside @xmath5 .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "one crucial difference between the examples in ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) is that in the first the cubics in the ideal have height one , while in the second they have height two .",
    "in this section we continue our discussion of homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci ideals , by constructing for any @xmath1 a reduced subscheme of @xmath117 of degree @xmath2 whose defining ideal is homogeneously licci , but not minimally homogeneously licci .",
    "we begin with a general remark .",

    "we may assume that @xmath25 is infinite .",
    "choose a sequence of linear forms @xmath122 which form a regular sequence on both @xmath44 and @xmath123 .",
    "the image of @xmath0 in @xmath124 has the same graded betti numbers as @xmath0 , and the images of @xmath125 in @xmath126 form a regular sequence .",
    "since both @xmath127 and @xmath128 have finite length , it follows from ( * ? ? ?",

    "thus , @xmath133 . moreover , if @xmath134 , then this remains true after passing to @xmath126 , since @xmath122 form a regular sequence modulo @xmath0 . in this case , since @xmath128 is gorenstein , @xmath135 , and therefore the largest @xmath2 for which @xmath131 must be strictly smaller than the largest @xmath2 for which @xmath132 .",
    "hence @xmath136 .",
