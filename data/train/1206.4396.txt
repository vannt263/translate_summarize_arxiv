    "the first generation of stars in the universe is the stellar population without any metal elements .",
    "although the formation of such metal - free stars , or so - called population iii ( pop iii ) stars may last until @xmath93 if the metal enrichment in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is inefficient , there is no firm observational evidence of the stellar population .",
    "the stellar population with metallicity @xmath10 , which is @xmath11 @xmath12 , is classified as extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars .",
    "low - mass emp stars found in the halo of the galaxy are survivors of the early stage of the formation of the galaxy . on the other hand , it is expected that their high - mass counterpart existed in the early days and died out until the current epoch .",
    "yet , there is no direct observational evidence of such massive emp stars at high-@xmath13 .",
    "this paper presents a possible signature of such ` primordial ' stellar populations in high-@xmath13 galaxies .",
    "there is a new population of galaxies at @xmath14 detected in their rest - frame @xmath0  , lyman continuum ( lyc ) .",
    "surprisingly strong lyc relative to non - ionizing ultra - violet ( uv ) was reported by @xcite .",
    "this may indicate the presence of the primordial stellar populations as shown in @xcite and below .",
    "lyc emitting galaxies .",
    "the vertical axis , @xmath15 , indicates non - ionizing uv spectral slope , and the horizontal axis , nb359@xmath16 , indicates lyc - to - uv flux density ratio .",
    "the filled circles with errorbars are the 3 laes without ly@xmath1 line offset @xcite and the open circles with errorbars are the 5 laes with the line offset @xcite .",
    "the filled squares with errorbars are lbgs reported in @xcite .",
    "the colours expected from the sed model with escaping stellar and nebular emissions developed by @xcite are shown by the dotted curve with inverse triangles ( model ac in table 1 ) , the solid curve with triangles ( model a ) , the dot - dashed curve with x - marks ( model b ) , the short - dashed curve with asterisks ( model c ) , and the long - dashed curve with squares ( model d ) .",
    "these curves are a function of @xmath17 and the colours for @xmath18 , 0.1 , and 0.01 are indicated by the symbols .",
    "we have assumed minimum and median igm attenuations in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , based on @xcite .",
    "the two diagonal arrows show dust attenuations with @xmath19 for the smc law ( solid arrow ) and the calzetti law ( dashed arrow ) .",
    "the shaded regions indicate the regions explained by the stellar population model a with a combination of igm and dust attenuations.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    @xcite and @xcite have found extremely strong lyc from some lyman @xmath1 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath2 .",
    "their redshifts were confirmed with spectroscopy .",
    "however , some laes show a spatial offset between ly@xmath1 emission line and lyc",
    ". these objects may have a faint foreground galaxy accounting for the ` pseud - lyc ' .",
    "however , it is difficult to attribute all the objects to foreground contamination in a statistical sense because of the smallness of the offset ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the extreme strength of the lyc of the laes found by @xcite .",
    "the filled circles are the most reliable objects without any offset , while the open circles are the objects with the small offset .",
    "the filled squares are the sample of lyman break galaxies of @xcite .      .stellar population models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us compare the observed colours with a spectral model with a single stellar population . in particular , we allow an escape of nebular lyc ( bound - free recombination continuum ) as well as an escape of stellar lyc as described in @xcite .",
    "this escaping nebular lyc boosts the flux just below the lyman limit .",
    "we call it ` lyman limit bump ' @xcite .",
    "actually , the nb359 filter used in observations of @xcite exactly traces the lyman limit bump at @xmath2 .",
    "then , the nb359@xmath16 colour becomes bluest not when the lyc escape fraction @xmath21 but when @xmath22 .",
    "this results in a round shape of the model curves in figure 1 which are a function of @xmath17 . among 5 types of the stellar populations in table 1 , we find that the stellar populations with an ordinary sub - solar metallicity and with a salpeter imf ( i.e. models a and ac ) do not fit the observed laes",
    ". if we insist on an ordinary metallicity , the imf should be massive ( models b ) .",
    "such a massive imf is expected only at extremely low metallicity like @xmath23 @xmath12 @xcite . if we wish to explain the laes bluest in nb359@xmath16 , some but not all of which may be foreground contamination , a stellar population with massive emp or metal - free ( models c or d ) is required .",

    "let us consider a system in which a primordial stellar population and a normal stellar population with sub - solar metallicity and salpeter imf coexist .",
    "we assume that the normal population makes stars with a constant rate ; the model ac in table  1 .",
    "for the primordial population , we adopt the model d ( pop iii ) .",
    "the mass fraction of the primordial population in the total stellar mass is a parameter for the mixture .",
    "the normal population may exist in dusty environment , but the primordial population are likely to be dust - free . a result is shown in figure 2 .    the laes without offset ( objects * a * , * f * and * g * ; filled circles in fig .",
    "2 ) require a primordial mass fraction of 0.110% .",
    "the bluest laes ( objects * b * and * c * ; open circles ) require a primordial mass fraction of more than 10% , but we could not reject the possibility that their nb359 flux was foreground contamination individually @xcite .",
    "the laes which are red in @xmath15 ( objects * d * , * e * and * h * ; open circles ) can be explained by a model with the smc law and a small amount of attenuation as @xmath260.3 and with a primordial mass fraction of a few 0.1% .",
    "note that the possibility of foreground contamination , especially for * d * and * e * , is the largest because of the largest line offset @xcite .",
    "we have suggested that the extreme strength of lyc observed in some laes at @xmath2 indicates the presence of massive emp or pop iii stars in them . such a galaxy population could be a cosmic ` ionizer ' for the reionization at @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , there seems an evolution of lyc emissivity of galaxies toward high-@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this may be caused by an increase of this type of the galaxy population at high-@xmath13 . in future",
    ", we should confirm the presence of the primordial stellar population in the galaxies .",
    "for example , we can constrain the metallicity to be @xmath28 @xmath12 if the ratio of [ oiii ] @xmath295007 to h@xmath30 is less than 0.1 @xcite . deep near - infrared spectroscopy for the laes",
