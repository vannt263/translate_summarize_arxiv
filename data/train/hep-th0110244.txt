    "it should therefore serve as a natural starting point for the development of techniques for the exact solution of such conformal field theories .    in the case of liouville theory with periodic boundary conditions we now have a relatively complete characterization @xcite : knowledge of the spectrum of the theory and three point functions of primary fields allow one to consistently reconstruct arbitrary expectation values of local fields on the sphere or cylinder .",
    "our understanding is less satisfactory in the case of liouville theory on two - dimensional domains with boundary such as the infinite strip , the upper half plane or the disk : one would again expect the theory to be fully characterized in terms of a finite set of structure functions together with the knowledge of the spectrum of the theory on the strip .",

    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the following section gathers those results on liouville theory that we will use in the present paper .",
    "the third section then contains our proposal for the three point function of boundary operators .",
    "it is based on the observation @xcite that an ansatz for that three point function in terms of the fusion coefficients naturally leads to a solution of the consistency condition that expresses the associativity of the product of boundary operators .",

    "one recovers the expression for the boundary reflection amplitude ( [ reflcoeff ] ) from the boundary three point function the same way the bulk reflection amplitude was recovered from the bulk three point function in @xcite : using the fact that the fusion matrix depends on conformal weights only , and is thus invariant when @xmath121 , one finds : @xmath122 from the expression ( [ gexp ] ) for the function @xmath89 , one indeed finds formula ( [ reflcoeff ] ) for @xmath123 .",
