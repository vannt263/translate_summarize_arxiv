    "we discuss major difficulties encountered by nonlinear modifications of the schrdinger  equation .",
    "before we enter the subject , we make it clear that nonlinear schrdinger  equations and nonlinear effective modifications of quantum mechanics are widely used in physics as approximate means .",
    "most typical is the mean - field approximation .",
    "it yields the nonlinear hartree - fock equation @xcite so basic for many - electron systems , and it yields the semi - classical einstein equation @xcite which is indispensable in quantum cosmology .",
    "these are approximate ( effective ) nonlinear quantum mechanics .",
    "one can , on the contrary , consider nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics at the fundamental level . as early as in 1952 , jnossy proposed @xcite that a simple state - dependent potential ensure localized stationary wave function of a free quantum particle ( of mass m ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a certain parameter .",
    "the new contractive ` mean - field ' potential counters the unlimited dispersion predicted by the standard schrdinger  equation .",
    "the stationary states are localized gaussians ( solitons ) .",
    "jnossy s equation was and remained forgotten until now @xcite .",
    "a gravity - related version of his nonlinear term was suggested much later independently by the author and by penrose @xcite , both being unaware of jnossy s equation yet seeking the same effect , namely , to ensure localization of quantum objects  massive ones this time .",
    "we choose this equation , called the schrdinger ",
    "newton equation ( sne ) , to be our testbed to discusse four typical catches otherwise valid for any nonlinear schrdinger  equations .",
    "it has been known since the beginning of quantum theory that it contains a certain latent non - locality . for instance , the collapse of the single particle wave function , occurring in quantum measurement , is to happen instantaneously over whatever large distances covered by the pre - measurement wave function . for two distant particles , einstein , podolski and rosen ( epr ) in    1935 @xcite constructed the sharpest example of apparent action - at - a - distance and john bell in 1963 @xcite pointed out a specific non - locality .",
    "it was also clear that neither the apparent action - at - a - distance nor the quantum non - locality could result in testable dynamical effects like dynamical action - at - a - distance or superluminal communication .",
    "the physicist and philosopher abner shimony formulated this paradoxical situation as the peaceful coexistence between quantum theory and special relativity @xcite .",
    "the reason of why formal violations of locality will all cancel from the measurable outcomes of quantum mechanics lie in the linear structure of the mathematical representation of the state space , dynamics , and measurable outcomes themselves . if one adds non - linear terms to the schrdinger  equation the peaceful coexistence ends and the physical violation of special relativity takes over .",
    "interestingly , jnossy @xcite mentions that his non - linear single particle schrdinger  equation suffers of superluminal physical influence .",
    "the most spectacular thesis belongs to gisin @xcite .",
    "any nonlinear modification of the single particle schrdinger  equation , @xmath3 allows for superluminal communication between the epr partners for whatever small state - dependent potential @xmath4 ( apart from the constant potential , of course ) .",
    "consider the single - body sne for the centre - of - mass free motion of a ` large ' composite object of mass @xmath5 : @xmath6 where the state - dependent newton potential reads @xmath7 although this equation is the newtonian limit of the approximate semiclassical eisntein equation , it was suggested that it might be fundamental @xcite and it is currently studied as such , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "our forthcoming analysis needs the following peculiar features of the sne .",
    "it possesses standing ( static ) soliton solutions @xmath8 of diameter @xmath9 c.f .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we can construct the schrdinger  cat states formed by two separate static solitons : @xmath10 the left and rigth solitons @xmath11 are seperated by a distance @xmath12 initially .",
    "because of the mean - field @xmath13 in the sne , the two solitons in @xmath14 attract each other and start to move , like this : @xmath15 they are oscillating as if they were two ( interpenetrating ) gravitating bodies of mass @xmath16 each , the periodicity is @xmath17 known from two - body problem .",
    "the feature we should note is the following .",
    "single soliton states @xmath18 and @xmath19 are static .",
    "the two - soliton schrdinger  cat states @xmath14 oscillate .",
    "the initial overlap of @xmath14 with @xmath11 is @xmath20 , see ( [ cat ] ) . in standard linear quantum dynamics",
    "the overlap would be constant in time .",
    "it is not so here , the overlap will oscillate with amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , it is zero for most of the time .",
    "the sne makes @xmath21 orthogonal to @xmath22 after a few times @xmath23 when the distance differs from @xmath24 by ( a few times ) more than the soliton size @xmath25 . to confirm the guess , consider the relative acceleration @xmath26 of the two solitons toward each other and calculate the time lapse until they get closer by a length @xmath27",
    "based on the above features of schrdinger  cat states under sne , we are going to present four interrelated foundational issues all originating exclusively from the nonlinearity .",
    "our thought experiments adapt gisin s two - qubit superluminal telegraph @xcite .",
    "suppose alice and bob are far away from each other .",
    "alice owns a qubit and bob owns a large mass @xmath5 , in the following maximally entangled composite state : @xmath28 three of the forthcoming testable controversies are based on this composite state , the fourth one uses the single particle dynamics in itself .",
    "alice measures either @xmath29 ( case i ) or @xmath30 ( case ii ) , each with random outcomes @xmath31 . in case",
    "i , bob s state collapses into the static single soliton states @xmath18 or @xmath19 , according to the outcomes @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , in case ii , bob s state collapses into the schrdinger  cat states @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "so far the story coincides with the standard epr scenario of standard quantum mechanics . the salient effect of nonlinearity enters from now on . in case i ,",
    "bob s states @xmath18 or @xmath19 remain static . in case ii , his states @xmath14 heavily oscillate . using no physical interaction with it , alice could cause a testable effect to the remote object of bob .",
    "this thought experiment is the continuation of the previous one .",
    "bob tests whether his initial state is preserved",
    "( case i ) or it is changing ( case ii ) .",
    "bob waits until a few times @xmath32 ( [ t ] ) and then he measures the projector @xmath33 the outcome is @xmath34 in case i and @xmath35 in case ii .",
    "this confirms that the action - at - a - distance ( sec .",
    "[ aad ] ) is testable .",
    "is it superluminal ?",
    "the answer is immediate if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) into the condition @xmath36 of superluminality .",
    "surprisingly , the distance @xmath24 cancels and we are left with @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , the action - at - a - distance ( in other words : the communication from alice to bob ) is always superluminal if the mass @xmath5 is at least a few times larger than the planck mass .",
    "the initial setup is the same as before , alice and bob are far away from each other but they are not assumed to cooperate this time .",
    "they may even not know about each other yet they are supposed to inherit the entangled states ( [ entangled ] ) .",
    "we assume that alice does not measure her qubit at all or , if she measures anything , bob can not learn anything about the measurement and the outcome .",
    "bob s local ( reduced ) state is anyway a mixed state @xmath38 the sne does , as a matter of fact , not apply to mixed states but pure ones described by a wave function .",
    "it is clear now that bob can not calculate the dynamical evolution of his local system .",
    "this incapacity is general since under natural conditions local quantum systems are never in pure states since they are always entangled with the rest of the world or with their environment at least .      to understand this catch",
    ", we need no epr situation but the single - body sne in itself . consider that the sne evolves a given initial pure state density matrix @xmath39 into a given final pure state density matrix @xmath40 and note that the map @xmath41\\ ] ] is nonlinear .",
    "we are going to show that any nonlinear map makes the statistical interpretation of quantum theory impossible .",
    "the proof is elementary and quick @xcite .",
    "consider the weighted statistical mixing of two states @xmath42 with weights @xmath43 , the resulting state reads @xmath44 in von neumann standard theory , the order of mixing and dynamical evolution are interchangeable : @xmath45= \\lambda_1\\mathcal{m}[\\rho_1]+\\lambda_2\\mathcal{m}[\\rho_2].\\ ] ] now we recognize that this is the mathematical condition of @xmath46 s linearity ! from the structure of the proof",
    "we see that the interchangeability of mixing and dynamical map excludes any nonlinear schrdinger  equation not just the sne . without such interchangeability",
    "the statistical interpretation of quantum states totally collapses .",
    "moreover , the principle of interchangeability of mixing and dynamics is not necessarily quantum , it is carved in marble in classical statistical physics .",
    "we listed four foundational issues encountered by nonlinear modifications of the schrdinger  equation .",
    "our example was the so - called schrdinger ",
    "newton equation but all four anomalies are equally valid for any deterministic nonlinear modification of the dynamics of any simple or composite quantum system .",
    "the best known and most spectacular anomaly is superluminality , a clear violation of special relativity .",
    "the derivation of superluminality exploits nonlinearity together with standard statistical interpretation of the wave function .",
    "less known is that already the statistical interpretation is in ultimate conflict with any ( deterministic ) nonlinearity of quantum dynamics , cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this anomaly is admittedly less spectacular than superluminality .",
    "it is , nonetheless , the deepest anomaly of nonlinear quantum mechanics .",
    "non - linear quantum mechanics , the sne first of all , attracts growing attention in foundations .",
    "awareness of the also foundational catches has recently motivated a stochastically re - linearized model @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the surviving and even growing interest in sne as it is can be explained and perhaps justified despite the catches if we point out certain loopholes . in summary ,",
    "nonlinear schrdinger  equations    * allow for * * fake action - at - a - distance but it may be extreme weak to be detected * * superluminal communication but it may be too hard to be realized * does not allow for * * local dynamics unless a local pure state is prepared * * standard statistical interpretation hence a new interpretation is needed    the last catch is the major one . _",
    "any _ nonlinear quantum theory needs a radical new interpretation of the wave function because _ any _ ( deterministic ) nonlinear dynamics makes born interpretation contradict to principles of statistics .",
    "this work was partially supported by the hungarian scientific research fund under grant no .",
    "103917 and eu cost action mp1209 ` thermodynamics in the quantum regime ' .",
