    "for a positive integer @xmath0 , consider the @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 whose non - zero entries are given by @xmath3 or explicitly , the matrix @xmath4 this matrix appears in the literature under several names : the sylvester - kac matrix , the kac matrix , the clement matrix , etc .",
    "it was already considered by sylvester  @xcite , used by m.  kac in some of his seminal work  @xcite , proposed by clement as a test matrix for eigenvalue computations  @xcite , and it continues to attract attention  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 has a simple structure , it is tridiagonal with zero diagonal and has integer entries .",
    "the main property of @xmath5 is that its spectrum is known explicitly and is remarkably simple ; the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are the integers @xmath6 the @xmath7 distinct eigenvalues are symmetric around zero , equidistant and range from @xmath8 to @xmath0 . hence for even @xmath0 ,",
    "they are @xmath7 consecutive even integers , while for odd @xmath0 they are @xmath7 consecutive odd integers .",
    "the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath2 are also known , they can be expressed in terms of the krawtchouk orthogonal polynomials @xcite .    as the eigenvalues of",
    "are known explicitly and because of the elegant and simple structure of both matrix and spectrum , @xmath5 is a standard test matrix for numerical eigenvalue computations ( see e.g.  example  7.10 in @xcite ) , and part of some standard test matrix toolboxes ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in matlab",
    ", @xmath2 can be produced from the gallery of test matrices using gallery(`clement',n+1 ) .",
    "the clement matrix also appears in several applications , e.g.  as the transition matrix of a markov chain @xcite , or in biogeography @xcite .",
    "general tridiagonal matrices with closed form eigenvalues are rare , most examples being just variations of the tridiagonal matrix with fixed constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the subdiagonal , diagonal and superdiagonal respectively @xcite . in this paper we present appealing two - parameter extensions of @xmath5 with closed form eigenvalues .",
    "these extensions first appeared in a different form in the paper @xcite as a special case of a class of matrices related to orthogonal polynomials .",
    "special cases of these matrices were originally encountered in the context of finite quantum oscillator models ( e.g.  @xcite ) and their classification led to the construction of new interesting models @xcite . here",
    ", we feature them in a simpler , more accessible form which immediately illustrates their relation with @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we consider some specific parameter values which yield interesting special cases .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to demonstrate by means of some numerical experiments the use of these extensions of @xmath2 as test matrices for numerical eigenvalue computations .",
    "hereto , we examine how accurately the inherent matlab function eig ( ) is able to compute the eigenvalues of our test matrices compared to the exact known eigenvalues .",
    "an interesting feature of the new class of test matrices is that they include matrices with double eigenvalues for specific parameter values .    in section  [ sec : newmat ]",
    "we present in an accessible form the two - parameter extensions of the clement matrix .",
    "we state the explicit and rather simple form of their eigenvalues which makes them potentially interesting examples of eigenvalue test matrices . in section",
    "[ sec : spec ] we consider some specific parameter values for the new classes of test matrices which yield interesting special cases . in section",
    "[ sec : num ] we display some numerical results regarding the use of these extensions as test matrices for numerical eigenvalue computations .",
    "this is done by looking at the relative error when the exact known eigenvalues are compared with those computed using the inherent matlab function eig ( ) .",
    "now , we consider the following extension of the matrix , by generalizing its entries to : @xmath12 where we introduce two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( having a priori no restrictions ) .",
    "we will denote this extension by @xmath13 . for @xmath0 even , the matrix @xmath13 is given by . note in particular that the first entry of the second row is @xmath14 and contains no parameter , and the same for @xmath15 . for odd",
    "@xmath0 , the matrix has entries @xmath16 and @xmath17 which now do contain parameters , contrary to the even case .",
    "the reason for considering this extension is that , similar to for @xmath2 , we also have an explicit expression for the spectrum of @xmath13 , namely :    [ eve ] for @xmath0 even , say @xmath18 , the @xmath19 eigenvalues of @xmath20 are given by @xmath21    [ evo ] for @xmath0 odd , say @xmath22 , the @xmath23 eigenvalues of @xmath24 are given by @xmath25    we will prove the results for the symmetrized form of these matrices .",
    "we briefly elaborate on this . consider a @xmath1 tridiagonal matrix with zero diagonal @xmath26 it is clear that the characteristic polynomial of @xmath27 depends on the products @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) only , and not on @xmath30 and @xmath31 separately .",
    "therefore , if all the products @xmath28 are positive , the eigenvalues of @xmath27 or of its symmetrized form @xmath32 are the same .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath33 are those of @xmath27 after multiplication by a diagonal matrix ( the diagonal matrix that is used in the similarity transformation from @xmath27 to @xmath33 ) .    using this procedure ,",
    "the aforementioned matrices can be made symmetric .",
    "for @xmath2 the entries can be symmetrized to @xmath34 this matrix is also implemented in matlab , namely as gallery(clement,n+1,1 ) . for the extension @xmath13 ,",
    "the entries of its symmetric form @xmath35 are @xmath36 for @xmath0 even and @xmath37 , while for @xmath0 odd we have @xmath38 for @xmath37 .",
    "the above theorems are now proved using a property of the dual hahn polynomials , which are defined in terms of the generalized hypergeometric series as follows @xcite @xmath39 the dual hahn polynomials satisfy a discrete orthogonality relation , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2.7 ) ) , and we denote the related orthonormal functions as @xmath40 .",
    "the orthonormal dual hahn functions satisfy the following pairs of recurrence relations : @xmath41 and @xmath42    * proof .",
    "*    the first two relations follow from the case dual hahn i of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) multiplied by the square root of the weight function and norm squared , and similarly the last two from the case dual hahn iii .",
    "@xmath43    * proof of theorem 2 .",
    "*    let @xmath0 be an even integer , say @xmath18 , and let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be real numbers greater than @xmath44 .",
    "take @xmath45 and let @xmath46 be the column vector with entries @xmath47 we calculate the entries of the vector @xmath48 to be @xmath49 for @xmath50 even , using the recurrence relation with the appropriate parameter values substituted in the orthonormal dual hahn functions , this becomes @xmath51 similarly , for @xmath50 odd we have , using now the recurrence relation , @xmath52 finally , define @xmath53 as the column vector with entries @xmath54 putting @xmath55 on the right - hand side of , it is clear that the entries of the vector @xmath56 are all zero .",
    "this shows that the eigenvalues of @xmath35 are given by , so its characteristic polynomial must be @xmath57 which allows us to extend the result to arbitrary parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath43    theorem 3 is proved in the same way , using now relations and .",
    "we now consider some particular cases where the eigenvalues as given in theorem  [ eve ] and theorem  [ evo ] reduce to integers or have a special form .    for the specific values",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 , it is clear that @xmath60 reduces to @xmath2 for both even and odd values of @xmath0 . as expected , the explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and also reduce to .    next ,",
    "we look at @xmath0 even . in , we see that the square roots cancel if we take @xmath61 . for this choice of parameters , the eigenvalues of @xmath62",
    "are even integers , which are precisely the same eigenvalues as those of the clement matrix .",
    "however , the matrix @xmath63 still contains a parameter @xmath9 which does not affect its eigenvalues .",
    "so for every even integer @xmath0 , gives rise to a one - parameter family of tridiagonal matrices with zero diagonal whose eigenvalues are given by .",
    "this property is used explicitly in @xcite to construct a finite oscillator model with equidistant position spectrum .    for @xmath0 odd ,",
    "say @xmath22 , the square roots in cancel if we take @xmath64 .",
    "substituting @xmath9 for @xmath10 , the matrix becomes @xmath65 while for the eigenvalues we get @xmath66 these are integers for integer @xmath9 and real numbers for real @xmath9 .",
    "we see that for @xmath58 , reduces to the eigenvalues , but then the matrix is precisely @xmath2 .",
    "non - zero values for @xmath9 induce a shift in the eigenvalues , away from zero for positive @xmath9 and towards zero for @xmath67 . however , for @xmath68 the positive and negative ( when @xmath69 ) eigenvalues get mingled .",
    "moreover , for @xmath9 equal to a negative integer ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath8 , we see that there are double eigenvalues .",
    "a maximum number of double eigenvalues occurs for @xmath70 , then each of the values @xmath71 is a double eigenvalue . by choosing @xmath9 nearly equal to a negative integer , we can produce a matrix with nearly , but not exactly , equal eigenvalues . for @xmath72 , all positive eigenvalues ( when @xmath69 ) become negative and vice versa .",
    "finally , for the special value @xmath73 , the eigenvalues also reduce to while the matrix becomes @xmath74 this is up to a similarity transformation , as explained at the end of section  2 , the matrix @xmath2 .    also for @xmath0 odd , another peculiar case occurs when @xmath75 .",
    "scaling by one half we then have the matrix @xmath76 with eigenvalues , by , @xmath77 the even equivalent of this matrix , @xmath78 does not have integer spectrum , but instead , using the expression , has as eigenvalues @xmath79    we have reviewed the special cases where the explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and which generally contain square roots , reduce to integers . in the following , we will use the notation @xmath80 to denote these special cases .",
    "we now examine some numerical results regarding the use of the extensions of the previous sections as test matrices for numerical eigenvalue computations .",
    "this is done by comparing the exact known eigenvalues of @xmath81 with those computed using the inherent matlab function eig ( ) .",
    "these numerical experiments are included merely to illustrate the potential use of the matrices @xmath81 as eigenvalue test matrices , and to examine the sensitivity of the computed eigenvalues on the new parameters .",
    "recall that both for @xmath0 odd and @xmath0 even , for the special case @xmath85 the square roots in the expressions for the eigenvalues cancel , yielding real eigenvalues for every real value of the parameter @xmath9 . in the general case ,",
    "the eigenvalues are real when @xmath86 and those in are real when @xmath69 and @xmath87 or @xmath72 and @xmath88 .",
    "a first remark is that when we compute the spectrum of @xmath2 using eig ( ) in matlab , eigenvalues with imaginary parts are found when @xmath0 exceeds 116 , but not for lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , for the extensions , we have chosen @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( for the even and the odd case respectively ) for most of our tests , as this gives reasonably large matrices but is below the bound of 116 .",
    "we will see that in this case for the extensions , the eig ( ) function in matlab does find eigenvalues with imaginary part for certain parameter values .",
    "we first consider the special case . for @xmath0",
    "even , @xmath85 has the eigenvalues , which are integers independent of the parameter @xmath9 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have depicted the largest imaginary part of the computed eigenvalues for the matrix @xmath85 for @xmath91 and @xmath89 at different values for the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we see that outside a central region imaginary parts are found . for example",
    ", for @xmath92 , matlab finds eigenvalues with imaginary parts when @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the relative error for the computed eigenvalues , shown in figures  [ fig2 ] , increases as @xmath9 approaches the region where eigenvalues with imaginary parts are found . in this latter region , the size of the relative error is of course due to the presence of imaginary parts which do not occur in the theoretical exact expression for the eigenvalues . as a reference ,",
    "the relative error for @xmath95 is @xmath96 , while that for @xmath97 is @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath0 odd , @xmath85 has the eigenvalues , which dependent on the parameter @xmath9 but are real for every real number @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , even for a small dimension such as @xmath101 , eigenvalues with ( small ) imaginary parts are found when @xmath9 equals @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "this produces a relative error of order @xmath104 , while for other values of @xmath9 ( and for the clement matrix ) the relative error is of order @xmath105 , near machine precision . for @xmath106 , the largest imaginary part of the computed eigenvalues is portrayed in figure  [ fig3 ] , together with the relative error .",
    "matlab finds eigenvalues with imaginary parts when @xmath107 .",
    "these findings correspond to the region where double eigenvalues occur as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the relative error is largest around this region and is several orders smaller when moving away from this region . as a reference ,",
    "the relative error for @xmath108 is @xmath109 , while that for @xmath110 is @xmath111 .",
    "finally , we note that eigenvalues with imaginary parts also appear when @xmath9 is extremely large , i.e.  @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "next , we consider the general setting where we have two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , starting with the case where @xmath0 is even . although the two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 occur symmetric in and in the matrix itself , there are some disparities in the numerical results . from the expression for the eigenvalues",
    "we see that they are real when the parameters satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "however ,    * when @xmath9 is a negative number less than @xmath114 , matlab finds eigenvalues with imaginary parts for almost all values of @xmath10 . * for negative values of @xmath10 ,",
    "no imaginary parts are found as long as @xmath86 . * for positive values of @xmath9",
    ", eigenvalues with imaginary parts are found when @xmath10 gets sufficiently large , as illustrated in figure  [ fig4 ] . * for positive values of @xmath10",
    "the opposite holds : eigenvalues with imaginary parts are found when @xmath9 is comparatively small , see figure  [ fig5 ] .    in the case where @xmath0 is odd ,",
    "similar results hold for positive parameter values for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as shown in figure  [ fig6 ] for example . for negative parameter values",
    "we have a different situation , as the eigenvalues can become imaginary if the two factors have opposite sign .",
    "when @xmath72 and @xmath88 , the eigenvalues are real again and the behavior mimics that of the positive values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the picture we get is a mirror image of figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the reason for this disparity between the seemingly symmetric parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 is that the qr algorithm wants to get rid of subdiagonal entries in the process of creating an upper triangular matrix . as a consequence ,",
    "the numerical computations are much more sensitive to large values of @xmath10 as it resides on the subdiagonal .",
    "this is showcased in figures  [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "most important is the sensitivity on the extra parameters ( @xmath9 or @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) which makes them appealing as test matrices",
    ".    it would be interesting future work if these new eigenvalue test matrices were to be used to test also numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues designed specifically for matrices having multiple eigenvalues @xcite , being tridiagonal @xcite , or symmetric and tridiagonal @xcite .",
