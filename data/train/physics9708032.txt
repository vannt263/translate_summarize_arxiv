    "the possible use of gaas detectors in the future high energy physics experiment atlas@xcite at the lhc imposes severe demands on the radiation hardness of the detectors .",
    "semi - insulating undoped gaas detectors have shown significant charge collection degradation after a 24  gev / c proton fluence of order @xmath8  @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the increase in the reverse current after this fluence , however , is slight , ( in the region of 2 - 3 times greater ) .",
    "this charge collection reduction can not be tolerated and requires data on the radiation hardness of other gaas materials .",
    "epitaxial material with a low initial deep level concentration , and thus high pre - irradiation charge collection efficiency ( cce ) , could provide the necessary radiation tolerance and therefore this material was investigated .",
    "gaas detectors are also ideally suited as x - ray imaging detectors for medical applications due to their high atomic number .",
    "to obtained the best x - ray images a high charge collection efficiency is required , preferably at low bias , and thus a low concentration of deep levels is desired .",
    "epitaxial gaas should be ideal for this application and this application contributed to the motivation of this work .",
    "the low pressure vapour phase epitaxial gaas was grown by epitronics corporation@xcite on the surface of a 450  @xmath9 m thick hitachi cable horizontal bridgeman gaas substrate .",
    "the substrate was n@xmath10 in nature with silicon doping at a concentration of 10@xmath11  @xmath3 .",
    "the vpe layer was n - type and varied in thickness across the wafer from approximately 240  @xmath9 m to 125  @xmath9 m .",
    "the surface of the vpe layer was chemo - mechanically polished with a h@xmath12o@xmath12:nh@xmath13 solution at a ph of @xmath14 , a process used in the preparation of lec wafers at glasgow university@xcite .",
    "this process removed approximately 30  @xmath9 m from the vpe layer and reduced surface imperfections .",
    "circular diodes of 4  mm is diameter were fabricated with metallic electrodes evaporated onto the front ( vpe side ) and back of the material .",
    "the front schottky contact was a ti / pd / au multi - layer while the back metallisation was pd / ge .",
    "the rear contact was not annealed and the ohmic contact was realised due to the n@xmath10 substrate .",
    "electrical and charge collection characterisation were performed on the diodes .",
    "the electrical characterisations were carried out at 300  k with the use of a keithley-237 source measurement unit and a hewlett packard 4274a multi - frequency lcr meter .",
    "the response of the diodes to alpha particle irradiation from an am-241 source under vacuum and to 60  kev photons from an encapsulated am-241 source were determined .",
    "since the front of the alpha source was coated with surface contamination , which reduced the energy of the alpha particles , the average energy was determined with an over - depleted silicon detector to be 4.1  mev .",
    "the diodes were biased and read - out with an eg@xmath15 g ortec-142 pre - amplifier .",
    "the signal was shaped with an ortec-485 post - amplifier with a shaping time of 500  ns and sent to a multichannel analyser .",
    "four of the vpe diodes were exposed to a fluence of @xmath4 24  gev / c protons  @xmath5 to test their radiation hardness .",
    "the irradiation was performed at the cern ps@xcite , switzerland , at room temperature and without bias .",
    "the diodes were stored for three months at room temperature after irradiation before characterisation .",
    "no search was made for effects due to annealing over this period .",
    "figure [ fig : pre - iv ] shows the current - voltage characteristics of the vpe schottky diode under both forward and reverse bias and demonstrate standard schottky characteristics for low bias , as shown in figure [ fig : pre - iv - lowv ] .",
    "however , at higher bias the reverse current did not saturate and continued to increase until diode breakdown at approximately 180  v.    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the charge collection of the vpe diode was higher than the lec diode both before and after irradiation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the vpe diode had a depletion width of only @xmath1630@xmath9 m and therefore the effect of a short absorption length will be less significant .",
    "the schottky diodes fabricated with vpe gaas behaved according to simple theory , that is without the presence of a significant concentration of deep traps .",
    "titanium - gaas barrier heights of @xmath0ev and @xmath1  ev were measured which are closed to those quoted in the literature .",
    "the reverse current - voltage characteristic did not saturate , an effect attributed to generation current in the depletion region .",
    "the donor concentration was obtained via cv analysis of the material to be @xmath2  @xmath3 , which prevented the extension of the depletion region beyond @xmath1630  @xmath9 m before breakdown occurred , due to the high bias required ( @xmath17200  v ) .",
    "charge collection experiments were limited due to the small depletion region .",
    "the charge collection efficiencies obtained from front alpha particle and 60kev gamma irradiation were close to 100% .    after a 24gev / c proton fluence of @xmath4  @xmath5 the vpe diode had a reverse current density measured at 100v reverse bias and 300  k , of @xmath18  a@xmath5 .",
    "this may be compared to @xmath19  a@xmath5 for an lec diode after the same fluence .",
    "the current increase for the vpe diode was over an order of magnitude .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the vpe diode was not guarded and a guarded ring could reduce the current due to a reduction in surface currents .",
    "deep levels were introduced . from the increase in resistance and the capacitance - voltage dependence",
    "the deep levels were appear to be acceptors . a fall in charge collection efficiency from front alpha illumination",
    "was observed and at a reverse bias of 200  v the cce fell from 100% to @xmath7% .    in comparison with a typical lec diode the vpe diode had a lower leakage current before irradiation , but this was not true after the radiation fluence .",
    "charge collection from a si - u detector was considerably worse than in the vpe device both before and after the radiation fluence .",
    "the small depletion width of the vpe diode , however , means that the results can not be directly compared .",
    "the material could be very promising for detector development if the free carrier concentration can be reduced to allow an increased depletion width .",
    "the materials radiation hardness is still a cause for concern .",
    "the authors would like to thank f.mcdevitt , a.meikle and f.doherty for technical support and all those at the cern ps facility during the irradiation run .",
    "one of us ( r.bates ) gratefully acknowledges the support received through a case postgraduate studentship from ral .",
    "the results obtained within the rd8 collaboration are from work partly funded by pparc ( uk ) , infn ( italy ) , and the bmfd ( germany ) ."
