    "recently , there has been great interest in non - adiabatic alignment of molecules using short non - resonant laser pulses @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite . here",
    "the molecules are excited in a rotational state showing time - dependent angular anisotropy with ensuing revival structure long after the passage of the aligning pulse .",
    "the time - dependent angular distribution after passage of the laser pulse can be measured @xcite , @xcite , and the states created have many uses in ultra - fast optics , high harmonic generation , scattering theory and potentially in chemical investigations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so far , the comparison of such experiments with theory has been though the resemblance of experimental data with numerical simulations of the time evolution from a known initial state .",
    "conversely , we propose a tomographic method by which one can find the initial quantum rotational state of a linear rotor from measurements of the angular distributions at several points of time .",
    "the molecules are coulomb - exploded with an intense , ultrashort probe pulse , also vertically polarized .",
    "the fragments recoil back - to - back and are imaged on a 2-d detector .",
    "the 3-d angular distributions can be found from these 2-d images because of the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "four examples of experimental data with iodobenzene are shown , where the imaged fragments are iodine ions : ( from left ) probe applied long before pump , probe applied after respectively @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2ps .",
    "part of the anisotropy , which is directly apparent in the un - aligned case , is due to the coulomb - explosion preferentially occurring parallel to the probe polarization .",
    "this is corrected for when finding the 3-d distribution .",
    "strictly speaking , iodobenzene is an asymmetric top , but only slightly . for many purposes",
    ", it behaves like a symmetric top .",

    ", a rotationally cold supersonic molecular beam is used as the molecular system in a pump - probe experiment .",
    "the initial state is thus approximately a thermal state with only a few energy levels excited .",
    "the pump is a short , with a typical duration of a few picoseconds , intense non - resonant laser pulse , which induces the rotational state .",
    "the pump pulse is linearly polarized and since the initial state is thermal and therefore rotationally symmetric , the rotational state formed will be cylindrically symmetric around the pump polarization axis .",
    "furthermore , the field mainly interacts with the molecule through the molecular polarizability , making the rotational state reflection symmetric in a plane orthogonal to the pump polarization .",
    "this last symmetry is not , however , a requirement for the tomographic method below .    after a delay ,",
    "the molecules are coulomb - exploded by an intense ultrashort probe - pulse , polarized parallel to the pump pulse , and with a duration of typically some tens of femtoseconds .",
    "the molecular fragments recoil approximately back - to - back and their angular distribution can be found from the imaged fragments .",
    "because of the cylindrical symmetry , the true angular distribution can be found even though the fragments are pulled by an electric field towards a detection plane containing the laser polarizations .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a tomographic method to reconstruct the rotational quantum state of the system from the measurement data in such experiments .",
    "we arrange the paper as follows : in section [ sec : qstintro ] we give a brief introduction to quantum state tomography . in section [ sec : teori ] we present the tomographic method for the rigid linear rotor . in section [ sec : centrifug ]",
    "we show how to extend the tomographic method to molecules where centrifugal distortion must be taken into account . in section",
    "[ sec : symtop ] we extend the tomographic method to the case of symmetric top molecules . in section [ sec : diskussion ] we discuss the possibilities of recording the experimental data necessary to perform a reconstruction and we conclude the paper .",
    "mathematically , tomography is a technique , closely related to fourier transformation , by which one can find a function from knowing its projection along all rotated lines .",
    "it found its first application in physiology in the 1970s , and tomographic techniques are now used extensively in hospital scanners , where images of internal tissue can be found from data recorded using x - rays or nmr .",
    "apart from physiology , tomography is currently also being used in many other fields of research , including quantum physics and chemistry . here",
    "the aim is to use measurements to find the quantum state of a system .",
    "the measurements are often taken to be spatial probability distributions at different times , which for harmonic oscillator systems makes the method very similar to the scanning methods from physiology @xcite , @xcite .",
    "quantum state reconstruction has also been considered for many other systems including particles in traps ( neutral atoms @xcite and ions @xcite ) , general one - dimensional systems @xcite , dissociating molecules @xcite and the angular state of an electron in a hydrogen atom with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in this section we will present a reconstruction method by which one can find the rotational state of a linear rigid rotor . as usually in quantum tomography",
    ", we imagine that we are able to perform measurements of spatial distributions at different points of time and that we know the hamiltonian governing the time evolution",
    ". the goal shall be to find the unique quantum state corresponding to these measurements .      before discussing the description of the quantum state",
    ", we shall first digress to account for what we know about the hamiltonian and its eigenstates . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", we are varying the time elapsed between the rotational state is created by a pump pulse and it is probed . during this time",
    "the molecule is in a field - free environment .",
    "consequently , we shall be interested in the hamiltonian for the free rotor .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the time evolution for the linear rotor with moment of inertia @xmath4 is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "the energy eigenstates of this hamiltonian are @xmath7 where the angular momentum quantum number @xmath8 and the projection quantum number @xmath9 .",
    "these states have energy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "since we will attempt to reconstruct the quantum state using angular distribution measurements only , we shall need the spatial coordinate representation of the energy eigenstates . as discussed further below",
    ", we shall restrict our study to azimuthally symmetric distributions , and we shall hence be interested in the distribution of the polar angle @xmath12 . for notational simplicity , we shall use the parameter @xmath13 so the position representation of the eigenstates becomes : @xmath14 there should be a factor of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : posket ] ) , but we can safely ignore this since we shall restrict our treatment to fixed values of @xmath16 . ) .",
    "another way to look at this is that since we assume azimuthal symmetry of the angular distributions , we might as well evaluate the position distribution at the azimuthal angle @xmath17 . ]",
    "the @xmath18 are the normalized associated legendre polynomials , normalized on @xmath19 $ ] @xcite : @xmath20 the multiplicative factors relating these to the un - normalized associated legendre polynomials @xmath21 are : @xmath22 eq .",
    "( [ eq : posket ] ) fully accounts for the free time evolution of the rotor .",
    "the angular position distribution of a single eigenstate is constant in time , but due to the different time dependent phase factors , a linear combination of different @xmath23 states will have time dependent interference terms .",
    "hence , such a linear combination will have a time dependent position distribution , also in the field free case .",
    "after this brief account of the dynamics of the system , we proceed to define what we mean by the quantum state we are trying to reconstruct .    in the present treatment",
    ", the state will be characterized by its density operator @xmath24 , which allows a description of statistically mixed states .",
    "specifically , we shall find all the matrix elements of @xmath24 in the @xmath23-basis at @xmath25 restricted to single @xmath16 s .",
    "this is the same as finding the diagonal blocks of constant @xmath16 in the density matrix , i.e. @xmath26 . for a general state this is only a partial characterization , but if it is somehow known that the state has no correlations between different @xmath16 values , knowledge of all @xmath27 amounts to a full characterization of the state .",
    "this is the case in the experiment described in the introduction and the procedure below will completely reconstruct the quantum state for such systems . for the angular distribution ,",
    "this diagonality in @xmath16 implies cylindrical symmetry for all time around a laboratory fixed axis , which we choose to be a spherical polar axis .",
    "having described the physical system , we proceed to consider the measurements performed ; namely the ( angular ) position distribution measurements at the time @xmath28 : @xmath29t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an arbitrary , but fixed , point of time after passage of the pump pulse .",
    "our aim is to invert this equation to find the density matrix in the eigenstate - representation @xmath30 .",
    "it will prove convenient to write the products of the two legendre polynomials @xmath31 as a sum of single legendre polynomials .",
    "this is exactly what is done in the decomposition of direct product bases for irreducible representations of the rotation group : @xmath32 are clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the notational simplification : @xmath35 writing the position distributions eq .",
    "( [ eq : prxtj1j2 ] ) in the new variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and using eq .",

    "( [ eq : prxtjj ] ) as : @xmath39 we have now expanded the time dependent position distribution on orthogonal polynomials @xmath40 with coefficieents that can be found by simple spatial integrals @xmath41 . these coefficients , in turn , are linear combinations of the density matrix elements which can be found if the distribution is recorded at different times , as we show below .      in this subsection we will present the reconstruction formulas .",
    "we will first consider the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and deal with the diagonal elements further below .",
    "we let @xmath42 be the time interval in which position measurements @xmath43 have been performed . here",

    "( [ eq : prxtjj ] ) suggests that a temporal fourier transform evaluated at frequency @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 suitably chosen integers , will be part of the reconstruction procedure . following this strategy",
    ", we consider the integral :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which makes both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are either even or odd . for the time",
    "being , we shall choose @xmath55 and deal with the @xmath56 case ( i.e. diagonal matrix elements ) later .",
    "notice that the delta - function in the sum over @xmath57 ensures that @xmath50 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are all of the same parity .",
    "this is also the parity of @xmath51 , since we chose @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be of the same parity .",
    "@xmath58 rather than giving a single term in the general case , the sums are greatly simplified . from the @xmath57-sum",
    "we get @xmath59 unless : @xmath60 using this in conjunction with the other delta - function we find @xmath59 unless : @xmath61 furthermore , this delta - function demands : @xmath62 as it turns out , for many choices of @xmath50 and @xmath51 there is only the straightforward solution to the equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : stordelta ] ) under the conditions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beting1 ] ) and ( [ eq : beting2 ] ) , namely @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in these cases",
    "we easily find the density matrix elements : @xmath65 for some choices of @xmath50 and @xmath51 there will be more than one term surviving from the sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ifortsaet ] ) .",
    "the physical reason for this is that there is more than one pair of energy eigenstates having a certain energy difference .",
    "one example is the energy difference between the states @xmath66 and between the states @xmath67 . in our variables",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we proceed to show that all density matrix elements with @xmath70 can be found regardless of this complication .",
    "imagine that we have found @xmath71 to contain the term @xmath72 , but also several other terms @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "the strategy is to calculate all the integrals @xmath75 .",
    "these may also contain several terms with @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , but always fewer than in the former integrals , i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "the reason for this is the condition @xmath79 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : beting2 ] ) : whereas the @xmath64 term will always appear , the rest of the terms in the sum eq .",
    "( [ eq : ifortsaet ] ) will have @xmath80 , whereby the procedure will terminate and we can find all the matrix elements of @xmath81 by back substitution .",

    "let us consider an example : we shall choose @xmath87 and try to find the matrix element @xmath88 . in this case @xmath89 , and we find @xmath90 . to find the desired matrix element we shall need the two extra equations @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "this method would be relevant if only a few particular elements of the density matrix are desired .",

    "( [ eq : ckm ] ) instead of @xmath157 .",
    "as the reader may have noticed , the method above effectively deals with a semi - continuous one - dimensional reconstruction in the space of @xmath158 and @xmath36 , and not with the reconstruction of a general state .",
    "the reason for this limitation is that the inversion formulas we are using are integral transformations that preserve dimensionality , like e.g. the fourier transformation in @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ifortsaet ] ) .",
    "if the dimensionality of the measurements are not at least as large as the dimensionality of the quantum state , such an approach nearly always fails @xcite .",
    "for example , in one dimension the density matrix is a two - dimensional object @xmath159 which has the same dimensionality as the measurement - space @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , the full quantum state of e.g. the linear rotor is a four - dimensional object @xmath160 , while the angular measurements @xmath161 would only be three - dimensional .",
    "if one desired to reconstruct a full general quantum state , one would either have to be able to perform more advanced measurements or to vary the hamiltonian as suggested in @xcite .",
    "because of the difficulty of precisely knowing hamiltonians arising from e.g. additional laser pulses , we have instead treated the one - dimensional system using only routinely performed measurements .    in spite of this limitation , the situation where the one - dimensional description is a complete characterization of the quantum system is experimentally common . indeed , for the situation described in the introduction , there are no correlations between the different @xmath132 and @xmath16 quantum numbers .",
    "the question is of course whether one can perform measurements of polar angular distributions for certain @xmath132 and @xmath16 quantum numbers",
    ".    a conceptually straightforward solution would be to use very low - temperature samples , where only @xmath162 is populated before the interaction with the pump pulse .",
    "note that this would not imply that the created rotational state would be a pure state due to inhomogeneities in the pump pulse focus , e.g. the pump intensity generally varies over the focus or shot - to - shot variation of laser intensity . though conceptually simple , this situation is unpractical due to the smallness of the rotational energies demanding very low temperatures .",
    "a more practical approach would be to select a certain value of @xmath132 and @xmath16 before interaction with the pump pulse . for polar",
    "symmetric top molecules this can be done for certain values of @xmath132 and @xmath16 by using the linear stark effect through hexapole focusing techniques @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the linear stark shift for symmetric tops is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the dipole moment and @xmath165 is the magnitude of the electric field . since one starts out with a thermal sample ,",
    "there are no correlations in either @xmath36 , @xmath132 or @xmath16 in the state before interactions with the pump .",
    "therefore , one does not discard any information on the state by picking out all sets of values of @xmath36 , @xmath132 and @xmath16 one by one .",
    "if the molecular beam was sufficiently cold , one could select components of the beam with certain @xmath132 and @xmath16 values , as is required by the method above .",
    "one would then also select a certain value of @xmath36 , which is not required , but on the other hand poses no problem .",
    "furthermore , the apparent ambiguity that a change of sign of both @xmath132 and @xmath16 gives the same stark shift is of no consequence , since the state created by the pump has identical matrix elements @xmath166 and @xmath167 due to the invariance of the initial state and of the pump - pulse interaction hamiltonians under the interchange @xmath168 .",
    "most linear molecules and symmetric tops with @xmath134 do not exhibit any linear stark shift @xcite , but also here hexapole focusing techniques can be used to select specific values of @xmath36 and @xmath16 through the second order stark shift . here , both molecules with the quantum numbers @xmath169 and @xmath170 are selected , but this is of no consequence since @xmath171 in accord with the previous paragraph .    in conclusion , we have presented a method to reconstruct the blocks @xmath166 of the rotational density matrix for linear and symmetric top molecules from angular distributions .",
    "this amounts to a complete characterization of the quantum state in a common experimental setup .",
    "finally , we have suggested how the required measurements could be performed with existing techniques .",
