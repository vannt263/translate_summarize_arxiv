    "we expect the transport properties to be particularly sensitive to this intriguing dynamics when the tunneling of electrons between molecule and leads switches the molecule between a symmetric and a jahn - teller distorted charge state .    in this paper , we investigate the consequences of such a berry phase for transport through single jahn - teller molecules .",

    "we show in section [ ssec : selectionrule ] that the berry phase induces a nontrivial selection rule for transitions between vibronic excitations of different molecular charge states .",
    "this selection rule , in combination with generic properties of the energy spectrum of the jahn - teller molecule , leads to the formation of trapping states in the sequential tunneling limit ( section [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "the consequences are a current - blockade outside the coulomb blockade window , asymmetry of the current - voltage characteristics , and strong negative differential conductance ( section [ sec : rateequations ] ) .",

    "placing a jahn - teller molecule between two biased electrodes exposes it to a potentially large electric field . for a semiconductor quantum dot ,",
    "weak coupling and good screening implies that the potential drop is concentrated in the contact regions between the electrodes and the dot.@xcite for a single molecule , however , this is less obvious .",
    "thus , the electric field may lift the electronic degeneracy by the stark effect and mix the vibronic levels by breaking the rotational symmetry of the adiabatic potential .    to estimate the mixing of vibronic levels",
    ", we note that the relevant vibrational modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not possess a dipole moment and are therefore unaffected by the electric field unless anharmonic mode mixing becomes relevant when other , `` dipole - active '' modes are strongly displaced .",
    "one readily estimates , however , that for relevant electric fields ( corresponding to voltage drops of the order of @xmath134 ) the typical displacements of dipole - active vibrational modes are small compared with their oscillator length @xmath135 , so that no anharmonic effects are expected . assuming that the dipole moment is of order @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the displacement of the dipole - active mode",
    ", we obtain a displacement @xmath138 .",
    "the length @xmath139 is of the order of the size of the molecular junction .",
    "we also note that the electric field does not directly couple the two electronic levels as both are @xmath140 orbitals .",
    "the stark shift is therefore quadratic in the electric field , and we estimate that it is several orders of magnitude smaller than the vibrational frequency .",
    "the coupling of the jahn - teller molecule to fermionic reservoirs , the electronic leads , may also introduce external perturbations that are able to break the symmetries of the system on which our approach relies so heavily . if the perturbation is too strong , for example , the degeneracy of the vibrational modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 is lifted and the energies are shifted by a large amount . the jahn - teller effect is then no longer of @xmath0- but rather of @xmath141-type . a selection rule like",
    "the one used in this paper is not available in such a model , and the current - blockade would not be visible . if , however , the perturbation is only small compared with the tunnel coupling , the mixing of the states induced by the perturbation is able to introduce a second time scale @xmath142 into the problem . as we have discussed in the previous paragraphs , the presence of two widely separated time scales only shifts the positions and alters the shape of the differential conductance peaks , no matter what the detailed physics behind the phenomenology of the conduction peaks are .",
    "we have shown that symmetry - induced degeneracies of electronic and vibrational modes can lead to new transport phenomena in single - molecule junctions . when the molecular junction consists of , say , an octahedral complex with an @xmath0 jahn - teller effect , a combination of berry - phase effects and a spectral trapping mechanism results in a non - trivial current - blockade , even for parameters where the coulomb blockade is lifted .",
    "it is evident from the physics of this blockade mechanism developed in this paper that it is associated with strongly enhanced shot noise of the current .",
    "@xcite we have also shown that the mechanism is quite generic and that the introduction of a second time scale to the problem , for example by higher order relaxation processes , co - tunneling , or external perturbations , has only quantitative effects on our results .",
    "the good agreement of the numerical results of our effective rate model with the general consideration of section [ sec : theory ] shows that the current - blockade that has been found in this context is a generic effect of systems with selection rules and spectral distortions .",
    "et al_.@xcite find a related current - blockade effect in systems where the strong spectral distortion alone damps certain franck - condon matrix elements .",
    "this is , however , no selection rule that derives from symmetries like in this paper ; it rather stems from the almost vanishing overlap of displaced oscillator wave functions .",
    "our discussion of jahn - teller molecules raises several interesting questions .",
    "the most important question concerns a complete understanding of the role of coherences between degenerate states and their implications for the transport properties of the system .",
    "what are the experimentally measurable quantities that are influenced by non - diagonal elements of the density matrix ? and",
    "when is a reduction to rate equations allowed ?",
