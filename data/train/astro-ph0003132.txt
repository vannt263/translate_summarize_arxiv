    "the absorption bands of the lyman and werner systems arising from the ground vibrational state of h@xmath3 provide a rich array of electronic transitions from different rotational levels .",
    "it is often true that these are the most conspicuous and plentiful features in the spectra of early - type stars below about 1100   ( morton 1975 ; jenkins et al . 1989 ; snow , allen , & polidan 1990 ) . in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the rotational excitation of molecular hydrogen is driven by a number of processes , such as collisional excitation and de - excitation , optical pumping by starlight , and the introduction of newly formed molecules .",
    "for this reason , the relative rotational populations of h@xmath3 have been used to gain insights on the characteristic molecule formation ( and destruction ) rates , temperatures , and densities in the h@xmath3-bearing clouds ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ; spitzer et al . 1973 ; spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ; spitzer & zweibel 1974 ; jura 1975a , b ; morton & dinerstein 1976 ; shull 1977 , 1979 ; shull & york 1977 ) .",
    "the uv data provide critical insights on the character of h@xmath3 that are useful to other kinds of observations and our current understanding of how various environmental factors influence the rates of molecule formation and destruction ( shull & beckwith 1982 ) .    in some cases , initial studies with the _ copernicus",
    "_ satellite revealed changes in the widths of the profiles for absorption features arising from levels with different values of the rotational quantum number @xmath5 ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ; spitzer , cochran , & hirshfeld 1974 ) .",
    "more exacting analyses of high quality recordings of the h@xmath3 profiles in several stars by spitzer & morton ( 1976 ) indicated that there were shifts in rotational temperatures for components with small changes in radial velocity , as one might expect for the gas behind shock fronts created by stellar winds .",
    "more recently , a significant improvement in the ability to study this phenomenon has come from the much better wavelength resolving power of the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) ( jenkins et al .",
    "1988 ) , which has flown on both sounding rockets and orbital missions ( jenkins 1993 , 1995 ; jenkins et al .",
    "1996 ) .    using data acquired by imaps on the orfeus - spas  i mission launched on the sts-51 space shuttle flight in 1993",
    ", jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) discovered that one of the velocity components of h@xmath3 in front of @xmath4  ori  a showed small , progressive velocity offsets and profile broadenings as the rotation states increased from @xmath11 to 5 .",
    "they made the conjecture that this behavior could arise from h@xmath3 forming in the collapsing column of partially ionized , cooling gas behind a nearly stationary bow shock facing away from us .",
    "this shock front was thought to be created by the abrupt deceleration of wind - like material from the star ( or other stars nearby ) as it collided with a dense cloud , perhaps similar to ones seen elsewhere in orion that have comet - like tails facing away from prominent stars in the association ( bally et al .",
    "1991 ; cernicharo et al .",
    "this interpretation was supported by spectroscopic evidence for low - ionization material at @xmath12 ( interpreted as the high speed material feeding the shock on its upstream side ) , and more highly ionized atoms at lower velocities ( immediate post - shock gas at @xmath13 ) .",
    "these velocities , relative to the observed pileup of cold material at about @xmath14 , implied a low compression ratio of 2.6 .",
    "jenkins & peimbert concluded that this outcome could be produced by an embedded magnetic field in the pre - shock material that is oriented nearly parallel to the flow .",
    "the motivation of the present investigation of h@xmath3 in front of the other two bright stars in the belt of the orion constellation , @xmath1  ori  a and @xmath2  ori , was to gather independent evidence on the phenomenon studied by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) for @xmath4  ori  a. since there are indications that the three stars are within a large cavity containing x - ray emitting gas ( burrows et al .",
    "1993 ) and enclosed by an expanding shell of cooler material ( reynolds & ogden 1979 ) powered by either stellar winds ( castor , mccray , & weaver 1975 ; weaver et al . 1977 ) or by one or more explosive events ( cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ) , it was not unreasonable to expect that we could witness additional manifestations of the unusual behavior of h@xmath3 .",
    "tantalizing indications that a phenomenon similar to that found by jenkins & peimbert was occurring on the line of sight to @xmath1  ori  a were discussed by spitzer & morton ( 1976 ) .",
    "the two additional orion belt targets were observed by imaps on its second flight conducted in late 1996 aboard the orfeus - spas  ii mission on sts-80 ( hurwitz et al .",
    "we present here the results of our investigation of the absorption features arising from h@xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section on observations (  [ obs ] ) starts with a description of some fundamental properties of the two target stars (  [ tgts ] ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori , along with @xmath4  ori  a which is featured as a contrasting case in later discussions .",
    "the imaps instrument and some properties of the data that are relevant to our investigation are described in the next subsection (  [ inst ] ) , and this is followed by a brief description of the exposures that were taken (  [ exposures ] ) .",
    "the section on analysis (  [ analysis ] ) describes some general steps that were taken in the data reduction (  [ general_steps ] ) , outlines some special procedures to register the velocities of features from h@xmath3 in different @xmath5 levels (  [ vel_regs ] ) , shows the results of an investigation to check on the relative @xmath15 values of the weakest lines out of @xmath16 , 2 and 3 (  [ validation ] ) , and ends with a description of how we constructed profiles of column density vs. velocity for each @xmath5 level .",
    "the fundamental qualitative properties of the h@xmath3 features in the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori are discussed in  [ qualitative ] .",
    "the distributions of h@xmath3 over different @xmath5 levels are presented in  [ distribution ] , using the concept of a rotation temperature over specific @xmath5 levels as a convenient way to describe the relative populations .",
    "we use these rotational temperatures to synthesize a few approximate conclusions about the strengths of the uv pumping fields . in the section that describes our interpretation of the results (  [ interpret ] )",
    ", we note that the unusual shifts and broadening of the h@xmath3 profiles for different @xmath5 found by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) seem to be correlated with the presence ( for @xmath4  ori  a ) or absence ( for @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori ) of high velocity gas (  [ hi_vel ] ) or the possible proximity of @xmath4  ori to a dense cloud with a high rate of star formation inside (  [ structures ] ) .",
    "finally , in  [ remarks ] we present a few remarks that pull together some of the concepts presented earlier and discuss their possible meanings .",
    "the two stars studied in this paper , @xmath1  ori  a and @xmath2  ori , have a separation in the sky of 144 and are members of the b subgroup defined by blaauw ( 1964 ) within the orion  ob1 association . later in this paper",
    ", we will be making comparisons with data recorded on an earlier imaps flight for @xmath4  ori  a and reported by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) .",
    "this star is nearly on the same line as that joining @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but it is 140 degrees from @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ dust ] ) . for the benefit of readers who wish to compare the h@xmath3 results with other observations of interstellar material , the equatorial and [ gaustad ] because nearly all of the maps of interstellar structures in the current literature use this coordinate system . ] and galactic coordinates of the three stars are given in table  [ coord ] .",
    "other important properties of these stars are also given in the table .",

    "the parallaxes measured by hipparcos , @xmath43 for @xmath1  ori  a and @xmath44 for @xmath2  ori ( perryman et al . 1997 ) , are consistent with this range of distances .",
    "both targets are bright , hot , and have a large projected rotation velocity ( see table  [ coord ] ) , making them excellent uv light sources for viewing narrow interstellar absorption lines .",
    "since the instrument has no entrance slit , it is important to know if there are companion stars which could introduce contamination signals to the main spectra .",
    "there are two companions to @xmath1  ori  a with wide separations from the visual primary .",
    "one is a type b2v with a separation of 52  ( hd36485 ) , but its visual magnitude is fainter by 4.6 , so its effect on the main spectrum is negligible . the other at 33  ( bd@xmath2200  983b ) has @xmath45 .",
    "two bright components of @xmath1  ori  a were identified by heintz ( 1980 ) and later confirmed by the speckle interferometry observations ( mcalister & hendry 1982 ) .",
    "recent determinations of their separation yield a value 0267 ( lindegren et al .",
    "1997 ; mason et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is much smaller than the equivalent of our wavelength resolution projected onto the sky ( about 10 ) . finally ,",
    "the visual primary is a partially eclipsing , spectroscopic binary ( koch & hrivnak 1981 ) with a period of 5.73  days ( harvey et al .",
    "our other target , @xmath2  ori , is a spectroscopic binary with also a visual companion that is 3  away and fainter by 8.7 magnitudes ( hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ) .",
    "detailed descriptions of the imaps instrument and how it performs have been presented by jenkins et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1996 ) .",
    "briefly , imaps is an objective - grating echelle spectrograph whose optical configuration is very simple , consisting of a mechanical collimator ( to reject the off - axis light from stars other than the target ) , an echelle grating with a 63  blaze angle , a parabolic cross - disperser grating , and , at the focal point , an electron - bombarded , windowless , intensified ccd image sensor . the nominal wavelength coverage of @xmath46   is obtained in 4 sequential exposures that span the free spectral range of the echelle format at different angles of grating tilt .",
    "spectra taken at different angles were not of uniform quality because they had different deviations off the optimum blaze angle of the echelle grating .",
    "this effect , combined with much lower reflection efficiencies of the gratings below about 1000  , resulted in large changes in signal quality over different regions of the spectral format .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to get good selections for lines out of various @xmath5 levels ( tables  [ h2linelist_dori ] and [ h2linelist_eori ] ) , even after defining a quality threshold for acceptance at a reasonably high level .",
    "the instrument is capable of attaining a wavelength resolution of order @xmath47 , but on this mission an out - of - focus condition resulted in @xmath48 and some overlap in energy between adjacent orders .",
    "the effective area of imaps for wavelengths greater than about 1000  ( where most of the h@xmath3 features that we used are located ) is about @xmath49 .",
    "there was a significant difference between the observations made on the orfeus - spas  i and orfeus - spas  ii flights , i.e. , those reported by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) for @xmath4  ori  a and those given in this paper , respectively .",
    "on the earlier flight , there was inadequate control of the humidity of the atmosphere inside the payload prior to launch .",
    "as a result , small water droplets formed on the hygroscopic ( and easily damaged ) k@xmath37br photocathode during the decompression and adiabatic cooling of the air inside the instrument that occurred during the initial phases of the shuttle launch . as shown by jenkins et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , all of the data recorded on the 1993 flight exhibited a blotchy pattern of efficiency variations caused by the damage to the photocathode . within each blotch ,",
    "the quantum efficiency was about 50% of the peak sensitivity in the unaffected regions .",
    "for the 1996 flight of imaps , more stringent precautions were taken to control the instrument s internal atmosphere prior to launch . as a result",
    ", the damage was prevented and photocathode response was very high , and uniformly so over the entire format .",
    "the photocathode damage on the first flight had both good and bad consequences .",
    "on the bad side , considerable effort during the reduction of the data was needed to make the required corrections for the variations . in some places ,",
    "these corrections may not have been perfect , so unpredictable , systematic variations in intensity could arise .",
    "also , the overall efficiency of the detector was somewhat less than it would have been otherwise .",
    "on the good side , the damage to the photocathode had a beneficial effect of providing an accurate indication of the detector s geometrical mapping function . by correlating the apparent positions of the blotches in the data with a post - flight photograph of the damaged photocathode , accurate corrections for the distortion of the recorded spectral image",
    "could be implemented during data processing , with the end result of producing accurate wavelength determinations for all of the absorption features .    for the data from the second flight reported on here , we had excellent looking raw data frames but no information about the geometric distortions ( aside from the bending of the orders  information which is of no use in understanding perturbations in the wavelength scale ) .",
    "it was clear that we could not use the mapping function from the previous flight for the @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori data because there was a change in the stray magnetic fields from other systems ( which affect the electron trajectories in the detector ) from the first flight to the second .",
    "thus , in short , for the @xmath4  ori data extraordinary measures were needed to correct for photometric errors , while wavelength derivations were relatively easy . for the @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori data the reverse was true : obtaining relative photometric information of good quality was straightforward , but",
    "special efforts were needed ( described in  [ vel_regs ] ) to obtain accurate radial velocities .",
    "the exposures for @xmath1  ori  a with a total integration time of 6064  s were spread over 3 sessions : 1996 november 22 01:3902:15  ut , november 29 12:1312:54  ut , and december 3 21:3322:12  ut . the last session had all exposures taken at a single grating tilt to enhance the quality of the spectra at the very short wavelengths of the deuterium l@xmath1 and l@xmath2 transitions , used ultimately for the study of atomic d / h ( jenkins et al . 1999 ) .",
    "an additional set of exposures was taken when the spacecraft was in a minimum drag configuration [ to avoid a possible collision with another satellite ( hurwitz et al .",
    "1998 ) ] , but the unusual aspect of the sun created an unexpected change in thermal conditions that shifted the cross - disperser coverage to much longer wavelengths , ones that were inappropriate for studying the h@xmath3 transitions . for @xmath2  ori ,",
    "a contiguous set of exposures was taken during a single orbit over the time interval november 29 04:3305:20  ut , for a total exposure time of 2452  s. sample portions of the spectra covering two h@xmath3 absorption features are shown in fig .",
    "[ h2sample ] .",
    "to derive an approximate wavelength scale , dispersion constants for the various exposures were derived from the observed positions of h@xmath3 features .",
    "however , we did not assume that lines out of different @xmath5 levels or with very different strengths necessarily had the same apparent radial velocity .",
    "this analysis could be carried out because the h@xmath3 lines are so plentiful ( we used approximately twice as many lines as those selected for analysis and listed in tables  [ h2linelist_dori ] and [ h2linelist_eori ] ) .",
    "we were able to create outcomes that were internally consistent to within about @xmath50 for @xmath1  ori  a and @xmath51 for @xmath2  ori , as judged by the rms dispersion of apparent residual wavelength offsets for lines coming from any given @xmath5 level .",
    "the lower rms dispersion of @xmath52 obtained by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) reflected the better control they had over their wavelength scales , as discussed in ",
    "[ inst ] . an important objective of our investigation was to detect any shifts in velocity across different @xmath5 levels .",
    "for this purpose , we devised a more precise tuning of the wavelengths for just the h@xmath3 profiles , so that we could register them with better accuracy .",
    "this procedure is described in  [ vel_regs ] below .    before extracting the spectra from the echelle orders ,",
    "a distortion correction procedure was invoked to remap the images so that the orders were approximately straight and horizontal . even though this was done",
    ", we found it necessary for the extraction program to determine the exact small residual vertical shifts ( in the cross - dispersion direction ) for each order as a function of horizontal position ( along the echelle dispersion direction ) .    the distribution of energy across each order in the vertical direction varied with position , owing to small changes in aberrations in the image .",
    "thus , in addition to characterizing the changes in the centers of the orders , we also measured their widths and how they varied with position .",
    "after the orders had been characterized , we performed an optimum extraction of spectral information using the formulae given by jenkins et al .",
    "this method not only gives the best signal - to - noise ratio , but it also compensates for the small spillover of energy between adjacent orders .",
    "this is needed to prevent the appearance of spurious , ghost - like features that would ordinarily arise if a simple `` dumb - slit '' extraction were performed .    for deriving the scattered light background levels , we obtained guidance from saturated atomic lines with flat bottoms",
    ". we also verified that our equivalent widths agreed reasonably well with those measured by spitzer , cochran & hirshfeld ( 1974 ) . in some cases , we had to make adjustments of up to 20% in the background levels to make some lines agree with others .      to reduce the errors in radial velocities caused by image distortions , we found pairs of h@xmath3 features that were near each other on the echelle spectrum format , but which came from different @xmath5 levels .",
    "lines on a single order that were separated by about 0.1  ( or less ) or lines on adjacent orders ( or nearly so ) with a very small horizontal separation were deemed to be suitable for this purpose .",
    "the identities of these combinations are given in the endnotes of tables  [ h2linelist_dori ] and [ h2linelist_eori ] .",
    "we then measured the differences in radial velocity and used them to define the relative shifts of the absorptions from different @xmath5 levels with respect to each other .",
    "the shifts averaged out to nearly @xmath14 for the features in both @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori , with the largest single deviation being about @xmath53 . in using the line pairs to define the velocity offsets ,",
    "our working assumption was that image distortions over very small scales were absent , and thus the offsets were identical for both lines .    to determine an absolute reference of the velocity scale , we compared the positions of the 5@xmath220  r(0 ) and 5@xmath220  r(1 ) lines to three prominent telluric features of o  i out of excited fine - structure levels .",
    "these lines are rarely seen to arise from interstellar clouds , and thus they serve as excellent velocity calibration features in our spectra .",
    "jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) encountered some difficulty in obtaining consistent results for different combinations of lines of h@xmath3 arising from the weakest members of the lyman bands out of @xmath11 , 1 and 2 .",
    "it was possible that these inconsistencies could have arisen from either uncorrectable saturation effects , systematic errors in the background levels , errors in the adopted @xmath15-values , or some combination of the three .",
    "the amount of h@xmath3 in the direction of @xmath1  ori  a is not very high .",
    "for this reason , the weak h@xmath3 transitions should have very small corrections for saturation , which leads to an opportunity to check on the reasonableness in the relative @xmath15-values .",
    "this is an important check to make , since these lines provide the only means for us to measure the strongest parts of the features out of @xmath11 , 1 and 2 for @xmath2  ori .",
    "figure  [ weaklins ] shows the curves of growth for weakest lines out of @xmath16 and 2 in our spectrum of @xmath1  ori  a. unfortunately , the weakest lines out of @xmath11 were too weak to give meaningful information . to estimate the amount of possible saturation in the h@xmath3 lines",
    ", we computed their expected behavior for a velocity profile that was identical to the superposition of components derived for na  i in front @xmath1  ori  a by welty , hobbs & kulkarni ( 1994 ) , based on their much higher resolution recordings of the d1 line .",
    "( there is no reason to expect the h@xmath3 to exactly mimic na  i , but this is the best example that we can draw upon .",
    "we do not want to use our own h@xmath3 data because there may be very narrow features that are not evident at our resolution . )",
    "the reasonably good correspondence between our measurements and the curves in the figure indicates that the adopted relative @xmath15-values from the theoretical calculations of abgrall & roueff ( 1989 ) are reasonably accurate .      after correcting individual line velocity offsets (  [ vel_regs ] ) , we derived the apparent differential column densities per unit velocity for each transition given by the expression @xmath54 where @xmath15 is the transition s @xmath15-value and @xmath55 is expressed in  . the apparent absorption optical depth @xmath56",
    "is defined in terms of the continuum level @xmath57 and measured intensity @xmath58 by the relation @xmath59 for each @xmath5 level , we consolidated the @xmath60 s for different lines into a single composite profile with the technique devised by jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) .",
    "not all of the lines that were visible in the spectrum were included in the composite .",
    "some were rejected because they had interference from other lines , were too close to the edge of an image , or fell below a threshold that we defined for the minimum acceptable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the lines that were chosen ( except where noted ) are listed in tables  [ h2linelist_dori ] and [ h2linelist_eori ] .    for @xmath2  ori , even the weakest lines out of @xmath11",
    ", 1 and 2 were saturated . in the central portions of these lines , we implemented the correction technique developed by jenkins ( 1996 ) to compensate for the error between the apparent optical depth @xmath56 and a smoothed representation of the proper optical depth @xmath61 .",
    "the pairs of lines that were used in each case are identified in table  [ h2linelist_eori ] .",
    "the other lines for these three @xmath5 levels were used to define the shoulders of the @xmath60 distributions .",
    "the usefulness of the correction technique is strongly driven by how well one knows the zero intensity level . if it is poorly known , there can be an ambiguity in the interpretation of lines that do not have @xmath56 scaling in proportion to @xmath62 .",
    "a poor scaling can arise either if the background levels are wrong or if the lines have unresolved , saturated substructures .",
    "unfortunately , there are no strong atomic lines in the vicinity of the weakest h@xmath3 lines .",
    "thus , for these cases we must acknowledge the existence of background uncertainties and their possible influence on the accuracy of the corrections for saturated absorptions for @xmath11 , 1 or 2 in @xmath2  ori .",

    "this seems to indicate that the gas in the main component is rather distant from the orion stars .",
    "the lower pumping rate in the lowest @xmath5 levels probably arises from the diminution of flux from distant stars by molecular complexes unrelated to the one seen toward @xmath1  ori  a , since in our spectrum only the strongest lines , such as those the werner 1@xmath220  q(1 ) and 2@xmath220  q(1 ) transitions , have central optical depths appreciably greater than about 2 .",
    "the suggested remoteness for this component of h@xmath3 from the orion association is an unexpected conclusion when one considers the fact that its velocity is very similar to one of the main components in front of @xmath2  ori ( and also @xmath4  ori  a ) .",

    "the correlation of the presence or absence of the high velocity gas with the phenomenon noted by jenkins & peimbert seems to favor their shock interpretation over completely unrelated alternatives .",

    "[ an earlier study of h@xmath110 emission in this vicinity by vidal ( 1980 ) also shows this result , but not as clearly . ] on the one hand , this finding suggests that the lynds  1630 cloud is behind the belt stars , if they were responsible for ionizing hydrogen and producing h@xmath110 emission in front of the cloud or right on the cloud s front edge . on the other hand",
    ", we could argue that one or more stars other than @xmath4  ori , such as @xmath109  ori ( spectral type o9.5@xmath37v ) , are responsible for most of the emission and are closer to us than @xmath4  ori .",
    "unfortunately , spectroscopic or hipparcos parallaxes are not accurate enough to resolve this issue .",
    "if , by contrast , we had found that the h@xmath110 emission were darker in front of lynds  1630 than in directions close to @xmath2  ori , we might have had a more positive indication that the cloud was well in front of the belt stars and appears as a silhouette .    other evidence that disfavors lynds",
    "1630 being in the foreground , but again not conclusively , arises from the distribution of dust shown in fig .",
    "the amount of infrared 100@xmath111 emission from the cloud s dust in the exact direction of @xmath4  ori leads to an expected b@xmath22v color excess that seems to be far greater than the star",
    "s actual @xmath41  =  0.05 . a hires processing of the 100@xmath111 image ( see inset of fig .  [ dust ] ) shows that we are not being misled by the smoothing in the representation generated by schlegel , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) combined with the star s proximity to a sharp edge of the cloud .",
    "nevertheless , the gas could be clumpy on scales even smaller than the hires picture , and the line of sight to @xmath4  ori could miss the clumps .",
    "the indications that lynds  1630 may be behind @xmath4  ori cast doubt on the interpretation that it is a conspicuous barrier for the stellar wind from the star .",
    "nevertheless , we still should not overlook the possibility that its presence in the same general direction of the star may still be significant .",
    "the cloud contains very dense concentrations of molecular material , as revealed by high - resolution maps of molecular emission by lada , bally & stark ( 1991 ) ( cs ) , bally , langer & liu ( 1991 ) ( @xmath112 ) , and stark & bally ( 1982 ) ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "it is often true that clouds containing compact molecular regions are sites of star formation , and the orion  b cloud is no exception ( bence & padman 1996 ; chernin 1996 ; launhardt et al .",
    "1996 ; zinnecker , mccaughrean , & rayner 1996 ; sandell et al .",
    "one product of star formation is the creation of high speed , bipolar flows of gas ( bally 1982 ; genzel & downes 1982 ; knigl 1996 ) with velocities that have about the same magnitude as the component in front of @xmath4  ori  a shown in  [ hi_vel ] ( eislffel 1996 ; hirth , mundt , & solf 1996 ) .",
    "if such flows penetrate beyond the edge of the dense cloud and into a low - density medium , they could extend over large distances ( reipurth , bally , & devine 1997 ) , perhaps even farther than the remote , multiple shocks ( bence & padman 1996 ) that can be detected in emission .",
    "still another possibility is that the high speed gas arises from the breakout of material from an embedded , recently formed h  ii region ( tenorio - tagle 1979 ; sandford , whitaker , & klein 1982 ; subrahmanyan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in  [ hi_vel ] we pointed out that @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori do not show gas at high negative velocities , while @xmath4  ori does .",
    "we can investigate this phenomenon further by examining the outcome of a survey of uv absorption features in b - type stars carried out by shore ( 1982 ) and sonneborn , et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in fig .",
    "[ dust ] we indicate the positions of these stars and with different symbols show whether they do ( * ) or do not ( + ) exhibit features from singly - charged ions at velocities equal to or more negative than @xmath114 .",
    "it seems clear that stars in the vicinity of lynds  1630 usually show the high - velocity features , while those that are somewhat removed in a lateral direction , such as the targets in the general vicinity of @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori , do not .",
    "this outcome suggests the possibility that the dense molecular cloud may be the source of high velocity gas . while this may be so",
    ", we should not overlook the fact that high velocity features are seen elsewhere in the orion region ( cohn & york 1977 ; cowie , songaila , & york 1979 ) , with some of them at locations outside the coverage of fig .",
    "[ dust ] . with this in mind , we could equally well propose that a more general , coherent expansion of gas from a larger scale event is taking place . in this picture , the appearances of high velocity features in fig .",
    "[ dust ] could arise from just random fragments of enhanced density in the expanding material .",
    "in studying the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori , we had high expectations of finding duplications of the unusual findings of jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) for one of the h@xmath3 components toward @xmath4  ori  a. they reported that the profile became broader and shifted toward more negative radial velocities as the rotational excitation increased from @xmath11 to 5 .",
    "our optimism about seeing more examples of this phenomenon was based on the premise that , in jenkins & peimbert s interpretation of a bow shock as its source , the stellar wind that may have created this shock front was probably a composite phenomenon common to all three stars in the orion belt . the apparent lack of this effect for @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori deprives us of the chance to see additional manifestations of it , but opens the way for us to examine circumstantial evidence that could give us more insight on the validity of the shock interpretation",
    ".    aside from not showing the strange behavior of h@xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori differ from @xmath4  ori in two other respects that could have a bearing on the shock interpretation .",
    "first , @xmath4 shows absorption by singly and doubly ionized species at a velocity of about @xmath115 , while the others do not .",
    "this high velocity material was a good candidate for the upstream gas that could have created the bow shock .",
    "second , in projection @xmath4  ori is very near the edge of the dense cloud lynds  1630 , an accumulation of gas that exhibits a bright edge of ionized material ( ic  434 ) on the side towards @xmath4  ori and holds within it many compact regions of star formation .",
    "the sight lines to @xmath1 and @xmath2 ori are , by contrast , unremarkable .",
    "the real source of the gas at @xmath115 that is seen in the spectrum of @xmath4  ori is uncertain .",
    "it may be some byproduct of the winds from the stars , but it is not easy to understand why similar components are not seen toward @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori .",
    "an interesting alternative is the possibility that the @xmath116 component has nothing to do with stellar winds from the belt stars .",
    "the complex of very dense gas near the @xmath4  ori line of sight is known for its plentiful star forming regions .",
    "such regions typically discharge gas at high velocities , starting with flows that are highly collimated .",
    "perhaps one such flow could escape from its gas envelope and be responsible for the high velocity component that shows up for @xmath4  ori in figs .",
    "[ ciispec ] and [ niispec ] .",
    "a well - directed flow could provide a reasonable way to explain the absence in the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2  ori of any feature analogous to the @xmath115 component exhibited by @xmath4  ori  a.    new insights on the problem discussed in this paper may arise from observations by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) , which has the capability of examining a very much broader sample of cases in its lifetime",
    ". however its lower wavelength resolution will make it harder to study the detailed structures in the h@xmath3 profiles , and productive research in this area may require the existence of even more extreme cases of profile variations with @xmath5 than those shown toward @xmath4  ori  a.    the observations reported in this paper were recorded by imaps during its second orbital flight , which was carried out on the orfeus - spas  ii mission in 1996 .",
    "this effort was a joint undertaking of the us and german space agencies , nasa and dara .",
    "the successful execution of our observations was the product of efforts over many years by engineering teams at princeton university observatory , ball aerospace systems group ( the industrial subcontractor for the imaps instrument ) and daimler - benz aerospace ( the german firm that built the astro - spas spacecraft and conducted mission operations ) . contributions to the success of imaps also came from the generous efforts by members of the optics branch of the nasa goddard space flight center ( grating coatings and testing ) and from o.  h.  w.  siegmund and s.  r.  jelinsky at the berkeley space sciences laboratory ( deposition of the photocathode material ) .",
