    "@xcite and @xcite perform detailed studies of nearby galaxies and conclude that both dust geometry and star - formation history have substantial impact on the placement of galaxies on the irx@xmath2  relation .",

    "beyond the nearby universe , the @xcite irx@xmath2  relation has played a fundamental role in estimating the amount of dust attenuation at high - redshifts , particularly at @xmath28 where direct infrared observations are unavailable @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite use measurements of the rest - frame uv slope @xmath2 of very faint near - ir detected galaxies at @xmath29 to constrain the dustiness of the early universe . because @xcite find that sources in high-@xmath0 surveys are significantly bluer than low-@xmath0 galaxies , they conclude that the dust obscuration plays an insignificant role in galaxy evolution at @xmath30 .",
    "given that the nominal irx@xmath2  relation is actually quite uncertain ( and based on potentially biased galaxy samples ) this constraint on high-@xmath0 dust obscuration needs independent verification from infrared / submillimeter surveys .",
    "constraining dust obscuration ( and star formation rates ) at the highest redshifts requires a thorough understanding and calibration of the irx@xmath2  relation beyond the local universe .",
    "unfortunately , calibrations of the irx@xmath2  relation have been very limited due to longstanding limitations and sensitivity of far - infrared observations .",

    "this lines up with expectation from the nominal @xcite irx@xmath2  attenuation curve ( in spite of its known problems caused by _ iue _ aperture limitations and lack of accommodation for ` normal ' type galaxies ) .",
    "recently , work on @xmath34 lbgs @xcite , using radio continuum measurements instead of direct far - infrared data , show further agreement with the @xcite relation .",

    "while the @xcite and @xcite direct far - infrared studies have shed valuable light on dust attenuation calibrations at high-@xmath0 , they both address the problem using uv - selected galaxy samples , which preferentially might have bluer uv colors and lower irx  values than the average galaxy at high - redshift .",

    "they find , perhaps not surprisingly , that dustier galaxies have higher @xmath3/@xmath4  ratios than those selected at uv wavelengths , even at matched rest - frame uv slopes .",
    "this is quite similar to earlier work on local ulirgs @xcite which found similarly high @xmath3/@xmath4  ratios , above expectation from irx@xmath2 .",
    "this difference between ` normal ' star - forming galaxies and infrared - luminous starbursts is attributed to emergent uv emission not corresponding to the same spatial regions of dust absorption and re - emission @xcite .",
    "indeed , some select studies describing the rest - frame uv and optical properties of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs , selected at 850@xmath1 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at high - redshift reinforce this result by finding little correspondence between uv luminosity , uv color , and fir luminosity @xcite .",

    "one primary difference seen between the expected sed of an lbg ( see the composite in fig  [ fig : highzcontam ] * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our contaminant template is that the rest - frame optical emission of lbgs is bluer than in dsfg contaminants .",
    "although this method of checking for dusty ` contaminants ' in uv galaxy searches has caveats , most notably mismatch photometric depths of the surveys and the likely incompleteness of dsfg samples beyond @xmath48 , it serves as a worthy reality check for high-@xmath0 galaxy search campaigns .",
    "the increasing rate of contamination in the highest redshift bins is due to both the degeneracies of colors over a relatively short rest - frame wavelength span and the diminishing surface density of higher-@xmath0 lbgs .",
    "overall , contamination rates of @xmath186 from dusty starbursts bode well for high-@xmath0 searches .",
    "besides providing an essential measurement of the universe s star formation rate density at very early times , high-@xmath0 lbg searches have led us to infer the dust content of the earliest galaxies using the irx@xmath2  relation @xcite . because the distribution of rest - frame uv slopes of lbgs is bluer at earlier times",

    "is needed to infer the dust content in individual high-@xmath0 lbgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular to constrain their sfrs and contribution to the total star formation rate density .",
    "this is because our results have only ruled out the tip of the iceberg : it is quite possible that blue lbgs in the early universe are much dustier than their uv slopes may infer yet still too faint to be detected in existing  data .",
    "furthermore , the existence of extreme , dusty galaxies at the same epochs should raise concern for our understanding of the integrated star formation rate density ( sfrd , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at these early times .",
    "the star formation rate in one dsfg can often exceed the sfr in individual lbgs by factors of 50100 .",
    "while here we have determined that a very low fraction of lbgs will be directly - detected by _",

    "satisfy lbg selection criteria .",
    "furthermore , we know that high-@xmath0 extreme dsfgs like hfls3 at @xmath188 _ do _ exist @xcite , yet the difficulty in obtaining spectroscopic identification has made the assessment of their volume density quite challenging @xcite . while our comparison to lbgs illustrates that there is little concern for significant contamination , we emphasize that the @xmath181 sfrd is still highly uncertain without concrete constraints from direct far - infrared measurements .    .",
    "the blue curve gives the average contaminant sed for the entire dsfg contaminating population , averaged over all selection redshifts ( in most cases , the dsfg redshifts are dissimilar to the target redshifts ) .",
    "this contaminant template illustrates the need for rest - frame optical constraints on lbg seds that are anticipated to be slightly bluer than most dsfg contaminants .",
    "note that very deep coverage shortward of the lyman break does not guarantee high - redshift identification , since most dsfgs also drop out of the bluest optical filters .",
    "the dsfgs photometry is observed and no normalization to a flux scale is done . ]",
    "our results indicate that galaxies with particularly high star formation rates , most of which are measured from their output in the far - infrared , are bluer than expected given the nominal dust attenuation curve for low - luminosity , ` normal ' star - forming galaxies",
    ". what underlying physical processes could be responsible for these bluer uv colors ?",
    "the first possible explanation is that the rest - frame uv emission and far - infrared emission are physically dis - associated , or spatially distinct @xcite . assuming that the systems are still physically bound , this might be due to a recent catastrophic event , like a merger - driven burst .",
    "can geometric effects alone explain the systematically bluer rest - frame uv slopes in dsfgs ?",
    "if a system consists of two dominant components , one with @xmath189 ( unobscured ) and one with @xmath190 ( obscured ) , both of which follow the irx@xmath2  relation , the irx  value assumed for the whole system will be taken from the obscured component , since there the ir luminosity dominates , and the @xmath2 value from the unobscured component , which dominates all uv light ; the result is an unresolved , blue dsfg with high irx . but take another system , which has its ir luminosity and uv luminosity well distributed in , e.g. , a disk ( for a simple test , if you were to split it into two components , as before , both would have roughly evenly matched @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "if the individual regions of this homogenized system all followed irx@xmath2 , then the total would as well .",
    "only dramatic spatial variations in the distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath3 can lift a system substantially above irx@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] illustrates how the relative dustiness ( irx  values ) between the two hypothetical , nearby components impacts how ` blue ' the aggregate sum of the two will be relative to irx@xmath2 .",
    "we constructed this figure by simulating @xmath191 pairs of components , where each indidivdual component sits on the irx@xmath2  relation . to explain a sample of very blue dsfgs systematically offset from irx@xmath2  using this geometrical argument",
    ", the vast majority of dsfgs would need to be comprised of two radially different components ( where irx  of the first would be a factor of @xmath61001000 times larger than the second ) .",
    "in other words , the distributions of irx  and @xmath2 over the spatial extent of a dsfg would need to be bimodal .",
    "indeed , this is effectively what we see locally ( e.g. arp220 , mrk273 , iras19254@xmath197245 ) . the subcomponents of local ulirgs which are infrared - bright produce very little uv light and the patches which are uv - bright are blue and see little ir contribution .    aside from physical dis - association , alternate explanations also exist , although with less observational backing amongst local analogs .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss them here since the effect we observe could be due in part to these multiple factors . as described in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , @xcite suggest that irx@xmath2  should not , in fact , be a fixed relation for all galaxies , but rather it should vary for galaxies with different star formation histories .",
    "the more recent and intense the star - formation , the bluer the galaxy ( for a fixed @xmath3/@xmath4  ratio ) .",
    "while overall this interpretation explains figure  [ fig : dbeta ] qualitatively , we note that such a pronounced ` break ' above @xmath115l@xmath7  might not be expected . whether or not it should be expected depends significantly on the given model assumptions for the effective absorption curve , and whether or not stars irradiate just their birth clouds or the ambient ism ( suggested to transition at a stellar age of 10myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the distribution of the stars with respect to the ism , the lifetime of burst episodes ( as short as 10myr to as long as 300myr ) , and the characteristics of the underlying long - term star formation .",
    "@xcite provide a sensible model construct for quiescent and normal galaxies , but do not offer an explanation for sources at low @xmath2 and high irx .",
    "those galaxies could be caught during a very short duration burst , where a substantial fraction of the emitted uv radiation is trapped in stars birth clouds before they have time to migrate out .",
    "plane if the two components are not resolved from one another .",
    "we simulate 10@xmath109 hypothetical pairs where all individual components lie on the irx@xmath2  relation ( dashed black line ) with observed local scatter @xmath1920.59 in @xmath2",
    ". only pairs with significant differences between component irx  values will be measured as having bluer - than - expected colors due to spatial disassociation .",
    "this simplified simulation is effectively modeling the relative bimodality of a galaxy s dust obscuration .",
    "we overplot all dsfgs within the narrow @xmath3 ranging corresponding to our simulation in light blue ( median values are dark blue squares ) for comparison .",
    "this figure suggests that most 10@xmath193l@xmath7  dsfgs are bimodal , or have spatially disassociated components which differ in irx  by factors of @xmath26300 . ]",
    "in addition to having a much bluer intrinsic uv slope , dsfgs might have enhanced @xmath3/@xmath4  ratios due to the short timescale of recent star formation .",
    "this might be due to uv radiation being trapped in stars birth clouds , or more globally , could be explained by the geometry of dust and stars in the galaxy . in a well - mixed ism with a more spheroidal distribution ,",
    "the surface - to - volume ratio is lower , and a galaxy with higher sfr will have a higher @xmath3/@xmath4  ratio , assuming @xmath3 emanates from the whole volume while @xmath4 emerges only from regions close to the surface . on the contrary , lower luminosity , continuous - sfr disk galaxies have lower optical depth for dust attenuation and greater surface area - to - volume ratios , implying ( a ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 emanate from the whole volume , and ( b ) the underlying uv continuum is redder than in extreme burst galaxies .    whether or not the magnitude of the shift towards bluer @xmath2 ( or higher irx ) for dsfgs is in line with expectation requires more detailed model investigation , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , our results support the notion that dsfgs are likely inconsistent with prolonged , constant star formation histories of disk galaxies , as might be suggested by works favoring the galaxy main - sequence view of dsfgs at high-@xmath0 .    in the context of the galaxy main - sequence",
    ", readers might be curious how our results would present themselves if , instead of a @xmath90- or sfr - dependent break in @xmath118 , we investigated the break as a function of galaxy stellar mass or specific star formation rate .",
    "we have intentionally avoided the use of stellar mass estimates in this paper , primarily due to their reliance on an assumed star formation history .",
    "infrared - luminous galaxies star formation histories are particularly difficult to determine and have large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this in itself is a topic of ongoing debate in the literature ( see more in   5 of * ? ? ?",
    "we hope that follow - up studies that do investigate irx@xmath2  with stellar mass will carefully disentangle various star formation history _ a priori _ assumptions from any conclusions used to interpret galaxy evolution .",
    "delving deeper into the underlying physics behind bluer uv slopes , aside from our simple and favored geometric explanation , the possibility was raised in   [ sec : analysis ] that metallicity and a possible top - heavy imfs might also contribute to a higher proportion of o starlight , and thus bluer slopes .",
    "a top - heavy imf might be plausible in the dense star - forming regions in ultraluminous galaxies , e.g. dsfgs , consistent with dense star clusters in the milky way like arches and westerlund  1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our observation of some evolution in dsfg uv slopes of matched ir luminosity in the range @xmath119 would be consistent with the idea that higher redshift systems are lower metallicity systems . note that , if we assume that dsfgs at higher redshifts should be less bursty ( as many papers suggest despite direct evidence to the contrary , e.g. *",
    "* ) , we might expect a shift in the _ opposite _ direction , towards redder uv slopes , or no shift at all .",
    "this is because main sequence galaxies are proposed to have steady state , approximately constant star formation rates for most of their lifetime ; even at very high sfrs ( @xmath6100m@xmath7yr@xmath8 ) , the expected underlying ( unextincted ) uv continuum of steady state star formation will be redder than starburst galaxies , which have a disproportionately large contribution of light from o and b stars above the less luminous and older a stars .",
    "again , our results are inconsistent with the suggestion that @xmath194l@xmath7  dsfgs at high-@xmath0 are dominated by steady state , secular , disky star formation .",
    "this paper has investigated the relationship between the @xmath3/@xmath4  ratio ( probing the relative ` dustiness ' of galaxies ) to their rest - frame ultraviolet continuum slope , @xmath2 , particularly as it pertains to infrared - selected galaxies . by comparing a sample of @xmath151200 nearby galaxies ( @xmath36 ) spanning star formation rates",
    "0.03300m@xmath7yr@xmath8  to a large sample of @xmath154000 ir - selected galaxies spanning photometric redshifts @xmath39 in the cosmos field , we have arrived at the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "we derive a much redder irx@xmath2  relationship for local galaxies than was presented in some of the original works on the topic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and attribute the difference to ( a ) differences between _ iue _ and _ galex _  aperture limitations ( the latter provides a more representative characteristic estimate for @xmath2 ) ; and ( b ) the fact that we derive the relation for a more heterogeneous population , not limited to galaxies selected as blue , compact starbursts . our derived relation is given in equation  [ eq : irxbeta ] .",
    "this is roughly consistent with prior works , which corrected the original relation for aperture differences @xcite .",
    "we find that , at both low and high - redshift , dsfgs with high sfrs above @xmath195m@xmath7yr@xmath8deviate from this irx@xmath2  relation towards bluer colors , where the offset grows with increasing ir luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "the deviation towards bluer colors , measured as @xmath118 is seen both in local and high-@xmath0 samples above a ` break ' ir luminosity of @xmath196l@xmath7  and increases with increasing luminosity such that at @xmath197l@xmath7 , galaxies are on average @xmath198 bluer than expected from the nominal irx@xmath2  relation fit in eq  [ eq : irxbeta ] .",
    "this offset towards bluer colors is shown not to be caused by sample selection effects .",
    "subtle redshift evolution is detected in the narrow luminosity regime @xmath199l@xmath7  for @xmath119 , where galaxies of matched ir luminosity are on average @xmath200 bluer at @xmath137 than at @xmath136 .",
    "no redshift evolution is detected above @xmath124 ( at representatively higher ir luminosities , corresponding to detection limits at that epoch ) .",
    "more extensive samples of equal luminosity over a wider range of epochs is needed to verify this perceived evolution .",
    "we attribute the bluer colors in dusty galaxies to more recent , rapid episodes of star formation ( following the  birthrate  parameter model offered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where more ir luminous galaxies have a more prominent population of young , o and b stars ( contributing to the rest - frame far - uv emission ) than galaxies of more modest star formation rates .",
    "not only are they intrinsically bluer , dsfgs likely have higher irx  values caused by lower emergent uv - to - ir luminosity ratios and mixed , patchy geometry .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that star formation in dsfgs at high redshift is dominated by burst activity rather than steady state , gradual disk growth .",
    "5 .   with deep multi - band uv / optical and near - ir data in hand",
    ", we investigated the rates at which dsfgs contaminate high-@xmath0 lbg dropout searches . due to the relatively low sky density of dsfgs",
    ", we find very low contamination rates at @xmath201 when both deep optical and near - infrared data exist .",
    "contamination rates increase at higher redshifts , up to 5.1%  at @xmath14 , where there is less information on the rest - frame optical and more potential low - redshift interlopers ( likewise , we see high contamination , 8.9% , at @xmath153 if observed near - infrared bands are not used for lbg selection ) .",
    "overall , dsfg contamination rates @xmath202%  bode well for lbg searches ; however , we caution that this does not imply that @xmath181 sfrd estimates from lbgs alone are sufficient for understanding star formation at early times .",
    "while this work has shed light on the issue of rest - frame ultraviolet emission in the dustiest galaxies , it is clear that much more work is necessary to understand the underlying physics driving these bluer rest - frame uv slopes in dusty galaxies .",

    "is crucial to isolate the dominant physical mechanisms in high-@xmath0 star formation .",
