    "the hubbard model has its origin in the description of electrons in solids @xcite .",
    "however , ultracold atoms in an optical lattice ( ol ) represent an almost perfect realization of this model with the additional advantage that many parameters such as the lattice depth and the interaction strength can be controlled and characteristics of the system can be observed with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) is a special form of the hubbard model describing bosonic particles in an ol . despite its striking simplicity",
    "it is able to describe exciting phenomena such as the quantum phase transition between the mott insulator and superfluid phase which is determined by the ratio @xmath0 of the interaction and the hopping parameter @xcite .",
    "if the system is quenched from one quantum phase to another , local many - body relaxation effects appear even without thermal relaxation .",
    "they are explained by the coupling between neighboring lattice sites in the bh hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "another prediction of the bhm is the existence of repulsively bound atom pairs in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a real solid , the optical lattice does not allow dissipation to phonons . as there is no resonant unbound state in the lattice , the repelling atoms are unable to decay .",
    "evidence for this effect was found in an experiment with @xmath1rb atoms @xcite .",
    "not only large optical lattices but also few - well systems such as double and triple wells are frequently modeled by a bh hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these systems have potentially a large range of applications .",
    "the triple - well system was proposed to serve as a transistor , where the population of the middle well controls the tunneling of particles from the left to the right well  @xcite .",
    "double wells , effectively generated by two interfering optical lattices forming a superlattice , are promising candidates to implement one- and two - qubit quantum gates @xcite .    to link experimental data to theoretical predictions of the bhm and to finally realize practical applications such as quantum gates , the precise knowledge of the parameters of the bh hamiltonian is , however , important . we want to clarify in this work under which conditions the bhm is applicable and how the bh parameters may be improved .    in order to examine and improve the validity of the bhm we calculate the energy spectrum of two interacting atoms in three wells of an ol by the help of a numerical routine introduced in ref .",
    "the reduction from the many - body problem to only two particles is senseful , because the bhm is often used to describe dilute quantum gases with one or two atoms per lattice site .",
    "also , the approximation of the ol by three wells does preserve all important microscopical features of the bhm of an ol .",
    "the bh hamiltonian of the triple well allows for tunneling of particles between the sites with amplitude @xmath2 , for different onsite energies @xmath3 assigned to each of the sites @xmath4 and of course for an onsite interaction with strength @xmath5 .",
    "the spectrum of the bh hamiltonian of the triple well consists of six eigenenergies which depend on the parameter set @xmath6 .",
    "although the parameters are predicted within the approximation of the bhm from the lattice depth , the confining potential , and the s - wave scattering length @xmath7 , one can define an optimal set @xmath8 , which minimizes the deviation between the bh spectrum and the one obtained numerically .    in this work",
    "we identify mainly two sources which can lead to large discrepancies between the predicted parameters of the bhm and the optimal parameter set .",
    "first , effects of the additional potential which confines the particles in three wells are clearly visible in shallow lattices .",
    "albeit this is an artefact of the restriction to three wells it is , of course , important for the theoretical description of double and triple wells by the bhm .",
    "the second and more severe discrepancy emerges if the scattering length @xmath7 is not significantly small compared to the characteristic trap length @xmath9 . as the wannier basis used in the bhm",
    "does not reflect interaction it leads to a wrong prediction of the interaction parameter @xmath5 for large scattering lengths as they appear experimentally in the context of ( magnetic ) feshbach resonances . in this regime the known analytical solution for two particles in a single harmonic well interacting via a point - like pseudopotential is often used to describe effects of the interaction @xcite .",
    "if no perturbation theory is implied , the harmonic approximation is , however , limited to very deep lattices . in this work a simple - to - calculate correction factor to the harmonic approximation",
    "is introduced that extends the validity to shallower lattices and improves the prediction even for deep lattices .    not only for strong interaction",
    "the standard bhm faces a potential weakness . for shallow lattices particles in neighboring wells",
    "are able to interact and hopping of particles to next - to - nearest neighbors can become important .",
    "one can , however , account for this by a so - called extended bose - hubbard model .",

    "note , for any depth of the lattice two repulsively interacting particles will enter this energy regime at the resonance as it is always half way to the energy of two particles in the second bloch band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_crossing ] ( b ) we have plotted in the region of resonance the ci eigenenergies of the lowest totally symmetric states in the trap . as they are of the same symmetry , avoided crossings occur .",
    "these appear close to where the estimated energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_crossing ] ( a ) ) shows ( true ) energy crossings .",
    "the avoided crossings are caused by a more or less strong coupling between states in different bloch bands , which is not incorporated in the estimated spectrum .",
    "particularly , the energy of states which can be identified with bh states of repulsively interacting particles is distorted due to avoided crossings .",
    "thus , one can not speak of pure repulsively interacting states in the first bloch band any more .",
    "in contrast , the coupling between non - interacting bh states and the first exited `` dimer '' is very small and no energy distortion is visible at the resolution of fig .  [",
    "fig : energy_crossing ] ( b ) .",
    "the complicated level structure indicates that the bhm , even if @xmath131 is used , has to be handled with care , if repulsively interacting and also non - interacting states at a resonance are to be described . in",
    "its corrected form it is , however , useful as a first approximation to find level crossings .",
    "the rich structure of avoided crossings offers potentially a scheme to convert states of repulsively interacting , attractively interacting , and non - interacting nature into each other by performing sweeps of the scattering length . to estimate the dynamical behavior of the system",
    "the knowledge of the coupling strengths between states in different bloch bands is crucial .",
    "since these couplings are ignored within the bhm more sophisticated calculations such as the one presented in this work have to be performed to gain a deeper insight .      especially for shallow lattices both the interaction between particles in nearest - neighbor ( nn ) wells and hopping to next - to - nearest neighbors ( ntnn ) can become important @xcite .",
    "one can easily account for this by including the according matrix elements from @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamwan ] ) into an extended bose - hubbard model ( ebhm ) with hamiltonian @xmath157 the ntnn hopping parameter @xmath158 decays much faster with the lattice depth than @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath132 it is one order smaller than @xmath2 and for @xmath159 already two orders .",
    "furthermore , the ebhm possesses in bh representation two new parameters @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , describing nn interaction .",
    "these parameters are generally at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , the bh representation of @xmath162 and @xmath163 can not be improved like for @xmath5 as there exists no analytical solution for two interacting particles in different wells .",
    "therefore , only if the following conditions are met , the ebhm can be quantitatively better than the bhm : * ( i ) * the scattering length is small compared to the trap length ( i.e. @xmath164 ) , since otherwise @xmath162 and @xmath163 are predicted inaccurately . * ( ii ) * the lattice is deep enough that errors of the bh parameters are smaller than @xmath162 , @xmath163 or @xmath165 .",
    "fulfilling the first condition , the case of weak interaction ( @xmath166 ) is discussed in the following .",
    "the second condition is not easy to meet in few - well systems , since especially the bh representation of the onsite - energies reflects the optimal parameters only for deep lattices ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : onsite ] ) , where @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath165 are already two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath5 and @xmath2 , respectively .    however , many observables do not depend on the absolute value of the eigenenergies , but on their differences .",
    "energy differences determine for example the characteristic frequencies of a state in a coherent superposition of different eigenstates .",
    "these frequencies can be measured experimentally with high accuracy such that deviations of the simple bhm can be observed @xcite .",
    "the influence of the errors of the onsite energies can be reduced by considering differences of eigenenergies as the latter do not depend on the absolute value of the on - site energies but only on the offset @xmath167 .",
    "although @xmath168 is also predicted inaccurately in the bh representation for @xmath169 , it has often only a minor influence on the energy differences .",
    "this is especially the case for the energy difference @xmath170 for which a diagonalization of the bh hamiltonian without interaction yields @xmath171 for the present potential with @xmath169 the relation @xmath172 holds .",
    "since the errors of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath5 are small for lattice depths down to @xmath173 , one can clearly identify effects of nn interaction and ntnn hopping as proper corrections of the bhm for this energy difference .     in different orders of approximation as a function of the lattice depth @xmath16 for @xmath174 .",
    "the value of @xmath170 is shown relative to the same energy difference predicted by the bhm in bh representation .",
    "the bh representation of @xmath175 was determined for @xmath176 and the value of @xmath2 and @xmath165 for @xmath50 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh_vs_ebh ] @xmath170 is shown relative to its value for the bhm with parameters steming from the bh representation .",
    "the correct energy difference is compared to the one predicted by the bhm which is successively amended .",
    "first , only effects of nn interaction are incorporated by the use of the ebhm without ntnn hopping ( i.e. setting @xmath177 ) .",
    "then the full ebhm is considered which is finally corrected by replacing @xmath125 by @xmath131 .",
    "the relative importance of these three corrections for different lattice depths becomes clearly visible .",
    "due to the weakness of the interaction ntnn hopping and nn interaction have comparable influence , most dominant at @xmath178 . for deeper lattices",
    "the correction of the interaction parameter becomes increasingly important and dominates finally for @xmath179 the correction of the bhm .    by including all three corrections",
    "one is able to determine the correct energy difference with about 1% accuracy down to lattice depths of only @xmath180 . below this lattice depth",
    "the ebhm is unable to improve the bhm significantly .",
    "additional effects steming from the confinement @xmath64 finally dominate the properties of the energy spectrum and the description by a bhm or even an ebhm becomes inappropriate .    also for other differences of eigenenergies the prediction of the ebhm improves the one of the bhm at least qualitatively ( depending on the importance of @xmath168 ) . only for differences involving the first energy level",
    "this is not the case . since for attractive interaction ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh_vs_ebh ] ) particles in the ground state predominantely occupy the middle well , the energy difference to higher lying states , where also the outher wells are occupied , is particularly influenced by @xmath168 .",
    "the error in the determination of @xmath168 can therefore dominate over improvements of the ebhm .",
    "we have verified that the failure of the ebhm to improve the bhm results for energy differences involving the ground - state energy @xmath181 does not occur , if repulsive interactions are considered .",
    "we have investigated the validity of the standard and an extended bose - hubbard model in a triple - well optical lattice .",
    "we defined the optimal bose - hubbard parameter set to be the one which reproduces best the eigenenergies of our full numerical calculations .",
    "this allowed to determine when the bose - hubbard model is principally able to describe the system under consideration and whether corrections of the standard bose - hubbard parameters are needed .",
    "for shallow optical lattices the confinement to three wells had a notable impact on the hopping parameter and the onsite energies .",
    "this impact could not be fully reflected by the standard values of these parameters .",
    "disagreements due to the confinement vanished , however , for lattice depths @xmath16 larger than the ground - state energy of the harmonic approximation @xmath182",
    ". therefore , in this regime our results are valid for both large optical lattices and few - well systems . for results concerning the interaction parameter",
    "this is also true for shallower lattices , since this parameter is barely influenced by the confinement .",
    "the standard interaction parameter showed to be valid only when the scattering length is smaller than one percent of the trap length .",
    "however , for this parameter we found an analytic expression which approximates the optimal interaction parameter very well for a large range of lattice depths and interaction strengths .",
    "since its definition is quite general , one can expect that it is extendable to hetero - nuclear systems , interacting particles in different bloch bands , and lattices with different wavelengths in the three spacial directions .",
    "the error due to the neglect of the energy - dependence of the scattering length was quantified and found to be of less importance than effects caused by the incompleteness of the wannier basis . for deep lattices",
    "this error is comparable to anharmonic effects .",
    "furthermore , we found that the sextic expansion of one well can already cover the full onsite interaction in the lattice . we have presented and explained the avoided crossing of repulsively bound pairs with states in higher bloch bands .",
    "finally , an extended bose - hubbard model was investigated and it was shown that in a region of small lattice depths it can partially improve the standard bose - hubbard model significantly .",
