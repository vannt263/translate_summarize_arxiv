    "it is well known that sharp propagation of free waves along light cones in even - dimensional flat spacetimes , known as huygens property , is blurred by the presence of a potential .",
    "physically , the spreading of waves inside the light cone is caused by the backscattering off the potential .",
    "if the potential falls off exponentially or faster at spatial infinity , then the backscattered waves decay exponentially in time , while the long range potentials with an algebraic fall - off give rise to tails which decay polynomially in @xmath0 .",
    "the precise description of these tails is an important issue in scattering theory .",
    "there are two main approaches to this problem in the literature . on the one hand , there are mathematical results in the form of various decay estimates .",
    "these results are rigorous , however they rarely give optimal decay rates inside the light cone and provide very poor information about the amplitudes of tails .",
    "the notable exception is the work of strauss and tsutaya @xcite ( recently strengthened by szpak @xcite ) where the optimal pointwise decay estimate for the tail was proved in four dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , there is no analogous result in higher dimensions .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are non - rigorous results in the physics literature based on perturbation theory .",

    "although these results were originally formulated for partial waves in four dimensions , they can be easily translated to spherical waves in higher dimensions .",
    "noticed that there are exceptional potentials for which the first - order tail vanishes , however they did not pursue their analysis to the second order , apart from giving some dimensional arguments .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze the tails for such exceptional potentials in more detail .",
    "one of the physical motivations behind our work stems from the fact that this kind of potentials arise in the study of linearized perturbations of higher even - dimensional schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the behavior of tails on the schwarzschild background in well known in four dimensions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but not in higher even dimensions ( despite statements to the contrary in the literature @xcite ) .",
    "although our analysis is restricted to the flat background , it sheds some light on the problem of tails on the black hole background because the properties of tails are to some extent independent of what happens in the central region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we construct the iterative scheme for the perturbation expansion of a spherically symmetric solution of the linear wave equation with a potential .",
    "this scheme is applied in section  3 to derive the first and second - order approximations of the tails for radial potentials which fall off as pure inverse - power at infinity . in section  4",
    "we discuss the modifications caused by subleading terms in the potential .",
    "section  5 contains numerical evidence confirming the analytic formulae from sections  3 and 4 .",

    "in this section we analyze how the presence of subleading corrections to the pure inverse - power asymptotic behavior of the potential affects the results obtained in section  3 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most interesting and common case ( below referred to as type  ii ) when near infinity @xmath87 if @xmath88 , then the dominant behavior of the tail is of course the same as in ( [ tail1 ] ) : @xmath89 however , in the exceptional case , when @xmath90 , the situation is more delicate . as we showed above , in this case there is the second - order contribution to the tail given by ( [ tail2 ] ) @xmath91 in contrast to the type  i case where the first - order tail vanishes identically , in the type  ii case the subleading term in the potential produces the first - order contribution which is given by ( [ tail1 ] ) with @xmath56 replaced by @xmath92 : @xmath93 assuming that @xmath92 is not an odd integer @xmath94 ( otherwise one has to repeat the analysis for the next subleading term in the potential ) .",

    "in order to verify the above analytic predictions we solved numerically the initial value problem ( 4 - 5 ) for various potentials and initial data . our numerical algorithm is based on the method of lines with finite differencing in space and explicit fourth - order accurate runge - kutta time stepping . as was pointed out in @xcite , a reliable numerical computation of tails",
    "requires high - order finite - difference schemes , since otherwise the ghost potentials generated by discretization errors produce artificial tails which might mask the genuine behavior .",
    "the minimal order of spatial finite - difference operators depends on the fall - off of the potential  for the cases presented below the fourth - order accuracy was sufficient , but for the faster decaying potentials a higher - order accuracy is needed . to eliminate high - frequency numerical instabilities we added a small amount of kreiss - oliger artificial dissipation all computations",
    "were performed using quadruple precision which was essential in suppressing round - off errors at late times .",
