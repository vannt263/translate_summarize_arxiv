    "the study of the structure of hadrons has been a powerful means for establishing and testing of the theory of strong interactions and for the determination of the partonic content of the nucleon . in 1969",
    "the slac - mit collaboration  @xcite observed the scaling behaviour  @xcite of the proton structure function in deep inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) .",
    "this observation established the quark - parton model ( qpm ) as a valid framework for the interpretation of dis data and that different partonic processes can be expressed in terms of universal parton densities .",
    "the smallness of @xmath1 , the ratio of the cross sections from longitudinally and transversally polarised virtual photon scattering measured in dis  @xcite , provided the first evidence of the spin-1/2 nature of the partons . in 1974 in @xmath2 interactions  @xcite and in subsequent neutrino and muon - nucleon scattering experiments , the observation of scaling violation and the identification of partons as quarks and gluons has confirmed the field theory of quarks and gluons and their strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the structure functions in qcd are defined as a convolution of the universal parton momentum distributions inside the proton and coefficient functions , which contain information about the exchanged boson - parton interaction . at sufficiently large four - momentum transfer",
    "squared , @xmath3 , when the strong coupling @xmath4 is small , a perturbative technique is applicable for qcd calculations of the coefficient and splitting functions .",
    "the latter represent the probability of a parton to emit another parton .",
    "expressions for structure functions are determined by convolution integrals of appropriate sums over the densities of quarks of different flavours and gluons , which predict a logarithmic @xmath3 dependence ( evolution ) of the structure functions .",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations are well established within the dglap  @xcite formalism to next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in the strong coupling and have recently been extended to next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) order  @xcite .    in 2004 d. gross , d. politzer and f. wilczek",
    "have been awarded the nobel prize for the discovery of asymptotic freedom .",
    "f. wilczek in his brief commentary  @xcite on the qcd foundational papers wrote that the `` most dramatic '' experimental consequence `` regarding the pointwise evolution of structure functions '' , namely `` that the proton viewed at ever higher resolution would appear more and more as field energy ( soft glue ) , was only clearly verified at hera twenty years later '' .",
    "indeed , the first measurements by the hera electron proton collider experiments h1 and zeus in 1992  @xcite revealed a steep rise of the proton structure function towards small @xmath5 , the fraction of proton momentum carried by the parton . the present state of the art of these measurements  @xcite is shown in figure  [ f2 ] as a function of @xmath5 at @xmath6gev@xmath7 ( left figure ) and as a function of @xmath3 at different @xmath5 values ( right figure ) .",
