    "<S> the microphase separation of a diblock copolymer melt confined by hard walls and in the presence of a gravitational field is simulated by means of a cell dynamical system model . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the presence of hard walls normal to the gravitational field are key ingredients to the formation of well ordered lamellae in bcp melts . to this effect </S>",
    "<S> the currents in the directions normal and parallel to the field are calculated along the interface of a lamellar domain , showing that the formation of lamellae parallel to the hard boundaries and normal to the field correspond to the stable configuration . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is found thet the field increases the interface width .    </S>",
    "<S> our main motivation for the present work has been to get insight about the mechanism responsible for the formation of well ordered layered samples of diblock copolymers , but , since the same striped pattern is observed in a variety of systems ( zebra skin , fingerprints , and the visual cortex , to mention some ) , we expect our results to be useful for the general problem of pattern formation in finite systems . the formation of the striped pattern has been studied by several authors and some factors important to the phenomenon have already been identified : ( i ) hydrodynamic interactions combined with the preferential wetting of a surface @xcite ; ( ii ) annealing and quenching of the structure , which are capable of relaxing the frustrated structure locally @xcite;(iii ) long range interactions with an external surface @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we intend to study the influence of two different effects that have not been included in the references quoted above ( and still need to be better understood in the general context of block copolymers ) : the simultaneous presence of the gravitational field and of a rigid wall limiting the actual size of the sample , as in realistic systems . for that matter </S>",
    "<S> we consider simulations of a block copolymer ( bcp ) melt based on a cell dynamical system ( cds ) model @xcite and the modified cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation for driven spinodal decomposition @xcite . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we analyze systems with a gravitational field normal to the hard boundary with the intention of reproducing the presence of a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> as observed in real systems , the layers are formed parallel to the substrate , even in the absence of interaction with the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> block copolymers are linear - chain molecules consisting of two each other . </S>",
    "<S> the subchains @xmath0 and @xmath1 are made of different monomer units , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> below some critical temperature @xmath4 these two blocks tend to separate , but due to the covalent bond , they can segregate at best locally to form a lamellar structure . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the microphase separation is similar to the spinodal decomposition of binary mixtures@xcite , so we borrow the cds model proposed by kitahara _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ for the spinodal decomposition with an external force field with the appropriate addition of a term that makes the large uniform domains unstable . as usual </S>",
    "<S> , we assign a scalar variable @xmath5 to each lattice site corresponding to the coarse - grained order parameter in the @xmath6-th cell at time @xmath7 ( time here is defined as the number of iterations ) . </S>",
    "<S> this order parameter represents the difference @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the local number density of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the ingredients for the time evolution of @xmath11 are : local dynamics dictated by a function with two symmetric hyperbolic attractive fixed points , diffusive coupling with neighbors , stabilization of the homogeneous solution and conservation of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation , when an external field is present , must be imposed by considering the kawasaki exchange dynamics explicitly . the detailed explanation of this model is found in @xcite for spinodal decomposition . with this , we come to final equation for a melt of even bcp molecules : @xmath12\\right )   ( i(n , t)-i(j , t))\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{eq - model}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is essentially the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is the isotropic space average of @xmath15 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 are positive phenomenological constants . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath3 appears in this model to stabilize the solution @xmath17 in the bulk , for @xmath18 we have a model for spinodal decomposition , in which the domains can grow without bound . </S>",
    "<S> scaling arguments have proved that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the polymerization index ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is the external field , which we assume is in the @xmath22 direction , and @xmath23 is the @xmath22 component of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the collision coefficient is given by : @xmath24[\\psi_c-\\alpha\\psi(i)]/\\psi_c^2 $ ] , where @xmath25 are the fixed points of @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> for all the simulations we used a 128@xmath27256 lattice , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and uniformly distributed random initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the external field , when present , is parallel to the smaller dimension , which we call @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the direction normal to the field will be called the @xmath30 direction . </S>",
    "<S> we impose no flux boundary conditions:@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig - free ] shows the pattern obtained after 20,000 , 40,000 and 60,000 iterations , for b = 0.018 and h = 0.001 .    </S>",
    "<S> domains initially aligned with the field present a varicose instability @xcite triggered by a density increase near the hard boundaries . in this varicose mode </S>",
    "<S> the bulges tend to grow making the coalescence of the domains possible and we observe the formation of lamellae on the `` substrate '' . </S>",
    "<S> the central region , oriented along the field , shrinks with time . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare these patterns to the ones obtained by brown and chakrabarti in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors numerically integrate the cahn - hilliard like equation of motion for the microphase separation dynamics with an extra term in the free energy functional that takes into account a long - range interaction with a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> what they see is truly a surface effect , their patterns present two regions : one with ordered lamellae , and another one with randomly oriented lamellae . that same pattern had already been reported in @xcite with a much simpler boundary condition : just keeping one line with a fixed value of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> here we observe patterns with regions where the lamellae are oriented normally to the field on top and bottom , ordered such that the denser part is in contact with the substrate , and another one in which the lamellae prefer to be parallel to the field , as found in systems with full periodic boundary conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the same boundary condition and @xmath32 , no layers are formed . to conclude the comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations using a cds model with the same form of surface field as in @xcite and no bulk field to be compared to simulations with the bulk field only . </S>",
    "<S> adjusting the value of @xmath21 such that the boundaries in both cases have the same values of the field , we need a surface field one order of magnitude larger to obtain the same number of lamellae . the patterns with the surface and bulk field are shown in figure  [ fig - surf ]    the presence of the field does not affect the linear stability about the homogeneous state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the solution @xmath17 is unstable when @xmath33 , independently of the field . </S>",
    "<S> for the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 used in the simulations here , we should expect to observe pattern formation for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> what we actually see from the simulations is quite different , though . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 is stable for @xmath39 . for smaller fields , </S>",
    "<S> there is pattern formation , but the amplitude of @xmath11 is smaller than that measured in the @xmath32 simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in amplitude is accompanied by an increase in the interface width , so the resulting pattern is less segregated than that without the field . as for the domain morphology </S>",
    "<S> the early stages of microphase separation are similar in driven and non - driven systems @xcite , in agreement with the linear stability analysis .    to understand the formation of lamellae on the hard boundaries we analyze the stability of one vertical lamella in the presence of a gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a gravitational field enhances the stability of interfaces parallel to itself@xcite which is not observed near the hard boundary . </S>",
    "<S> to understand this we assume that close to the interface , the non - local term of the ch free energy for block copolymers is an irrelevant constant . in this spirit </S>",
    "<S> , we use the modified ch equation proposed in @xcite for the spinodal decomposition in the presence of a gravitational field in the @xmath22-direction : @xmath40 , \\label{chfield}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] is the usual ch free energy , @xmath42 , for binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state solutions of ( [ chfield ] ) for a system with hard walls normal to the field satisfy    [ currents ] @xmath43 @xmath44    with this , we see that the presence of the bottom wall forbids the stable flux in the vertical direction so the system seeks the naturally stable pattern , the one parallel to the wall . from ( [ jz ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown , for the case of horizontal lamellae , that the interface becomes less sharp with increasing @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is noticeable in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - surf ] : all the patterns where plotted with the same grey scale so it is clear that pattern ( b ) , with gravitational field , is more diffuse . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be understood if we assume that @xmath45 for a particular interface located at @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath50 , hence @xmath51 and @xmath52 which shows that the interface has an elongated profile in the presence of the field . in summary , we conclude that the presence of hard walls normal to the gravitational field are key ingredients to the formation of well ordered lamellae in bcp melts . </S>",
    "<S> other interactions like hydrodynamics and preferential wetting of the substrate may enhance this effect , but we find that the bulk field considered here is more efficient than a surface field for ordering the lamellae , and involves a different mechanism of lamellae formation . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the gravitational field increases the interface width , producing less segrgated patterns . </S>"
