    "in the current consensus picture of structure formation in the universe , gaussian random field density perturbations created at the end of inflation grow via gravity into the large - scale structure we observe today . on large scales ,",
    "this growth is mediated by baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the ionized plasma prior to decoupling @xmath0 ( sakharov 1966 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 , 1987 ; holtzmann 1989 ; hu & sugiyama 1996 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ; eisenstein , seo & white 2007 ( hereafter esw07 ) ) , silk damping from photon diffusion ( silk 1968 ) , and neutrino free streaming ( bond & szalay 1983 ) . on smaller scales and at later times , non - linear collapse , virialization and",
    "mergers also play a role .",
    "however , on large enough scales and at early enough times , the density fluctuations remain small relative to the background , and so the growth of structure can be accurately described using linear perturbation theory ( bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 , for a review ) .    while we do not know the initial density field in any given region of the universe , the linear - theory evolution is deterministic and is encoded in the green s function in configuration space or the transfer function in fourier space .",
    "these are a fourier transform pair : the green s function is the response to a point - like initial overdensity in an otherwise homogeneous universe , while the transfer function is the response to a flat initial perturbation spectrum .",
    "one can combine the green s function or transfer function with the statistical properties of the initial , gaussian random density field to predict late - time observables within linear theory .",
    "in particular , linear theory predicts the 2 and 3-point correlation functions of galaxies ( 2pcf and 3pcf ) , which measure the excess probability over random of finding galaxies at a given separation or on a given triangle configuration .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillation method compares measurements of the 2pcf in different redshift slices with these predictions to constrain the universe s expansion history , exploiting an order @xmath1 bump in the 2pcf due to the sound horizon at decoupling , @xmath2 , as a fixed scale that dilates as the universe grows ( eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ; blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; linder 2003 ; see eisenstein et al . 2005 and coles et al . 2005 for first detections , with previous observational hints summarized in eisenstein et al . 1998 ) . this method has already yielded measurements of the cosmic distance scale with @xmath1 precision with the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; anderson et al .",
    "2014 ) , and is a leading lever for constraining the equation of state of dark energy ( weinberg et al .",
    "2012 ) through upcoming efforts ( jain et al . 2015 ) such as dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ; levi et al .",
    "2013 ) , dark energy survey ( des ) , euclid ( laureijs et al .",
    "2011 ) , large scale synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; lsst dark energy science collaboration 2012 ) , and wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ; spergel et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in practice ,",
    "the equations of linear perturbation theory , e.g. presented in ma & bertschinger ( 1995 ) , are solved using numerical codes such as cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) or code for anisotropies in the microwave background ( camb ) ( lewis 2000 ) .",
    "these codes run in of order a few minutes on a typical personal computer and are considered to be accurate at the sub - percent level . for a given set of cosmological parameters",
    ", they can unambiguously compute numerical tables of the linear theory predictions . however , an important area of work has nonetheless been semi - analytic fitting formulae for the transfer function , as these show in closed form what the dependence on cosmological parameters is . in particular the fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ; 1999 ) helped enable the development of the bao method by demonstrating the sensitivity of the bao bump to cosmological parameters . these fitting formulae agreed with the numerical results of cmbfast within @xmath1 at that time , though one might expect less good agreement now as details of the codes such as recombination and reionization history have changed .",
    "these fitting formulae were derived by smoothly interpolating between analytic solutions available for the large and small - scale limits of the transfer function , corresponding to scales either much larger or much smaller than the sound horizon at matter - radiation equality .",
    "the first work on the small scale limit was done by mszros ( 1974 ) , and the large - scale limit was also solved around this time , in groth & peebles ( 1975 ) ; see also kodama & sasaki ( 1984 ) .",
    "hu and sugiyama ( 1996 ; hereafter hs96 ) , yamamoto , sugiyama & sato ( 1997 ) and weinberg ( 2002 ) treated the small - scale limit in greater detail , including the bao behavior on small scales as well as the effects of neutrinos ; boyanovsky , de vega & sanchez ( 2008 ) derive an analytic expression for the dm transfer function on very small scales for a variety of dm candidate particles during the matter - dominated regime .",
    "for further discussion of previous work , see peebles ( 1980 ) , padmanabhan ( 1993 ) , dodelson ( 1998 ) , and weinberg ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , the bao scale , @xmath3 , falls in the middle region where no analytic solution had been known and where the fitting formulae simply interpolate .",
    "this middle region is also where the transfer function transitions from scale - independent growth on large scales to scale - dependent , increasingly suppressed growth on small scales due to the evolution of the radiation inhomegeneities during radiation - domination . from a practical standpoint",
    ", the availability of accurate numerical solutions means that the lack of analytic work here is not a problem either for understanding the parameter dependence of the bao or for deriving constraints on the cosmic expansion history .",
    "however , from a theoretical and pedagogical standpoint it is disappointing that there is no analytic solution in this especially interesting regime .",
    "further , developing a means of solving the behavior on this scale might lead to a general approach that could be used on all scales , giving a completely analytic method of computing the full transfer function or green s function .    in this paper , we develop an approach that allows us to compute the growth of structure on these scales , as well as on the smaller and larger scales that had previously been solved .",
    "we offer a simple , self - consistent picture of how dark matter , baryons , and photons interplay to create the large - scale clustering of galaxies we observe today ( insofar as this is accurately described by linear perturbation theory ) .    in  2 , we offer a qualitative configuration - space picture that sets up what follows .  3 outlines the approximations used all the way through the paper and presents the expressions for the sound speed and sound horizon we require .",
    " 4 derives the base equation for the growth of perturbations we will be solving , and calculates the solution outside the sound horizon used throughout the paper . in  5",
    "we solve for the growth of perturbations inside the sound horizon with massless baryons and no decoupling ;  6 incorporates massive baryons , decoupling , and photon diffusion ( silk ) damping , appealing to simple numerical work .",
    " 7 shows how  6 may be redone perturbatively , with no appeal to numerical work , for small baryon fraction .",
    " 8 concludes .",
    "before the universe becomes neutral at @xmath4 and baryons and photons dynamically decouple ( @xmath5 ) , the electrons are tightly coupled to the photons by thomson scattering , and the protons to the electrons by coulomb attraction . as a simple starting point , consider the behavior of a spherically symmetric , point - like ( delta function ) overdensity of dark matter , baryons , and photons set up at the origin at some very high redshift in an otherwise homogeneous universe .",
    "the universe s response to this perturbation is the green s function , and were the true initial density field known , convolving it with this response would provide the late - time linear theory matter distribution ; for development of the green s function picture see bashinsky & bertschinger ( 2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "since the photon fluid has pressure @xmath6 , the perturbation at the origin will have greater photon pressure than its surroundings .",
    "thus the photons ( and tightly coupled baryons ) will be launched outwards in a spherical pulse .",
    "the high pressure in the fluid opposes density fluctuations on scales much smaller than the sound crossing scale , giving the pulse a roughly constant density interior to the sound horizon .",
    "we now examine the behavior of the background universe in the presence of this perturbation .",
    "first we consider a spherically symmetric bubble with radius larger than the sound horizon . due to the perturbation at the origin ,",
    "it is overdense relative to the background universe and so will contract when measured in coordinates comoving with the background universe .",
    "all of the baryon - photon pulse is still contained within this universe , and so the average overdensity contained is the same as it was in the initial condition . by gauss s law",
    ", the collapse will be the same as if the baryon - photon pulse simply had remained concentrated at the origin .",
    "effectively , this bubble does not know about the propagating pulse : the information about the pulse s behavior has only reached the sound horizon , and this bubble is sensitive to the average overdensity over a region larger than the sound horizon .",
    "thus the collapse of this bubble is relatively straightforward to compute .",
    "further , it is the same whether the baryons are tightly coupled to the photons or not ; it depends only on the total matter density and the photon density .",
    "it is also insensitive to the details of how the sound horizon is calculated .",
    "this bubble corresponds to blue shells not yet covered by the red photon pulse in figure [ fig : shells ] .",
    "meanwhile , for a bubble of radius less than the sound horizon , mass has not been conserved : some of the baryon - photon pulse has exited the bubble , driving down the average overdensity and retarding the collapse relative to that of the outside - horizon bubble . for a bubble that is extremely small compared to the sound horizon",
    ", the baryon - photon fluid can be treated as a homogeneous background , and this is the approximation of mszros ( 1974 ) .",
    "however , to correctly trace the behavior of bubble whose size is similar to the sound horizon at matter - radiation equality ( of order @xmath7 ) , the baryon - photon overdensity pulse s contribution to the gravitational forcing must be incorporated .",
    "how this is done certainly is sensitive to whether the baryons are counted as photons or not , as well as to details of how the sound horizon is computed .",
    "providing an approach for following the pulse s effect is a major advance of this work .",
    "the bubbles inside the pulse correspond to those blue shells covered by the red photon pulse in figure [ fig : shells ] .    ) and zero outside it . for details on the computation of this panel see esw07.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) and zero outside it . for details on the computation of this panel",
    "see esw07.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "throughout this work , we make the following approximations . we ignore neutrinos entirely , and take all radiation energy density to be in photons .",
    "we assume the baryons and photons are tightly coupled , i.e. that the spatial profiles of the overdensity in each species perfectly match .",
    "finally , we assume that the baryon - photon pulse s spatial profile is a heaviside function in radius , constant out to the sound horizon and zero thereafter .",
    "this is motivated by the high sound speed in the fluid , and is a good match to the exact linear theory result from cmbfast ( figure [ fig : shells ] , bottom panel ) .",

    "the second factor corresponds to the proper sound horizon at redshift zero and the first factor rescales this to matter - radiation equality and comoving coordinates .    in  6 and  7",
    "only , we take the baryons to be massive , meaning their density will dilute with the scale factor as @xmath41 .",
    "this also implies the sound speed varies with the ratio of baryon to photon momentum density @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 the baryon fraction .",

    " 6 decoupling of the baryons from the photons does occur and we take it to be instantaneous .",

    "the photons are traveling outwards in the bao and so some will exit our bubble : photon number _ within the bubble _ is no longer conserved .",
    "there are three effects that alter @xmath102 .",
    "first , the photon overdensity only ( not the background density ) dilutes as the sound horizon grows : the overdensity propagates to larger and larger scales and thus decreases in amplitude .",
    "second , the dilution is somewhat balanced by the growth of the photon overdensity as its overdense bubble of radius @xmath77 contracts relative to the unperturbed background .",
    "third , the unperturbed photon density dilutes as @xmath103 as the background universe expands .",
    "we approximate that the photon overdensity is constant within the sound horizon .",
    "this approximation is motivated by the extremely high pressure in the relativistic fluid ; it quickly smoothes any inhomogeneites in the photon density within @xmath77 . further motivating this approximation , padmanabhan ( 1993 ) shows that in a radiation - dominated cosmology the photon perturbation in fourier space is @xmath104 , which in configuration space is a constant out to the sound horizon and zero beyond .",
    "comparing with numerical results from cmbfast originally presented in esw07 , and shown here in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : shells ] , also confirms our approximation . in detail ,",
    "the photon density peaks up somewhat near the origin due to the dark matter there and also has a slight bump at the sound horizon from the convergence of the outgoing pulse with photons infalling from outside the sound horizon .    since in our work",
    "the photon overdensity ( and hence spherically averaged overdensity ) is constant within the sound horizon , we need only set its amplitude . by construction , the spherically averaged photon overdensity must be continuous at the sound horizon , so this amplitude is simply @xmath105 .",
    "figure [ fig : spherical_avg ] shows how the true and spherically averaged photon overdensities compare and how the latter outside the sound horizon can be used to set the amplitude within the sound horizon .    .",
    "]    inside the sound horizon , the dark matter perturbation s evolution is given by equation ( [ eqn : eom_outside ] ) : recall this simply came from newton s law of gravity .",
    "however , here we treat the photons as a forcing given by @xmath106 rather than as following the matter as they did in  4 ; we have changed variables to the dimensionless @xmath107 .",
    "we also define a forcing function @xmath108 so that equation ( [ eqn : eom_outside ] ) here becomes @xmath109 we solve using variation of parameters , which writes the full solution in an eigenbasis given by solutions of the homogeneous ( unforced ) equation ( i.e. with the righthand side of equation ( [ eqn : matterin ] ) set to zero ) .",
    "the homogeneous equation is the mszros ( 1974 ) equation with a growing solution @xmath110 and a decaying solution ( groth & peebles 1975 ) @xmath111\\right ) , \\label{eqn : decay}\\ ] ] and the wronskian is @xmath112    the general solution of equation ( [ eqn : matterin ] ) is then @xmath113\\bigg\\ } , \\label{eqn : vpsoln}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the scale factor at which @xmath13 enters the sound horizon . as earlier noted , this writes the full solution in an eigenbasis given by the growing and decaying mode of the homogeneous equation ; the integrals should simply be interpreted as projecting the forcing @xmath115 onto this basis , with division by the wronskian correcting for the possibility that the basis is not orthonormal ( @xmath116 if it were ) .",

    "the imperfect agreement on small scales is attributable to eh98 s inclusion of neutrino free streaming , which our work ignores .",
    "the neutrinos move at roughly @xmath144 outward from the density perturbation at the origin and therefore are an additional contribution to the mass within shells larger than the sound horizon relative to the mass within shells inside the sound horizon .",

    "algebraic manipulations of these results would lead to a closed form for the matter green s function , though these expressions would likely be cumbersome and so are not presented here .",
    "two major physical themes are illustrated by our work .",
    "the first is that , even in the absence of baryons , the transfer function develops a smooth knee at the scale of the sound horizon at matter - radiation equality .",
    "shells outside the horizon at this epoch grow more than shells that have entered the horizon , because these latter are losing some of the gravitational force of the photon perturbation since it is partially outside their gaussian spheres . as the universe expands and the photon density becomes sub - dominant to the matter density , the exact moment at which a mode enters the horizon becomes unimportant so the transfer function flattens out . in other words ,",
    "after matter - radiation equality , shells entering the horizon still lose some of the photon perturbation s gravitational forcing , but this perturbation is so diluted that they barely notice .",
    "the second physical theme relates to the bao . in this work",
    "we have shown that the discontinuity in the time - derivative of the spherically averaged baryon overdensity at the sound horizon at decoupling leads to a dirac delta function - like spike in the spatial behavior of the true baryon overdensity at decoupling .",
    "this in turn contributes to the total matter overdensity proportional to the growing mode , so the late - time transfer function and green s function retain structure at the sound horizon .",
    "this structure is particularly striking in the green s function , manifesting as a localized bao bump .",
    "this is the analog of the bao bump seen in the matter correlation function today .",
    "neither of these physical themes are new to this work ( see for instance sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; press & vishniac 1980 ; hu & sugiyama 1995 ; hs96 ; eh98 ; weinberg 2002 ; esw2007 , and many others ) but we believe the configuration space , spherical shell approach presented here significantly clarifies what is meant by fourier modes entering the horizon .",
    "further , we believe the self - consistent , complete , and nearly fully analytic treatment offered here of the growth of structure on all scales is novel and of intrinsic interest . while we do not suggest that the work here is accurate enough to supercede either codes such as camb and cmbfast or fitting formula such as eh98 , we believe it is complementary .",
    "the codes are complicated and the fitting formulae are purely phenomenological in the intermediate region where they interpolate : our treatment here involves only a few equations to show how the underlying physics propagates through to the final functional forms .",
    "a future direction of our own work may be to extend the treatment here to neutrinos .",
    "as earlier noted , their dynamics are complicated because they free - stream .",
    "given that upcoming large - scale structure surveys promise to place tight constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses ( jain et al .",
    "2015 ) , it may be rewarding to build the qualitative yet detailed understanding of neutrinos effects our approach here might afford .",
