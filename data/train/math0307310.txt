    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be a domain ( connected open set ) with compact closure . consider a reflecting brownian motion ( rbm in abbreviation ) @xmath2 in @xmath3 .",
    "heuristically , rbm in @xmath3 is a continuous markov process @xmath2 taking values in @xmath4 that behaves like a brownian motion in @xmath5 when @xmath6 and is instantaneously pushed back along the inward normal direction when @xmath7 .",
    "rbm on smooth domains can be constructed in various ways , including the deterministic skorokhod problem method , stochastic differential equation with boundary condition , martingale problem methods , etc .",
    "see the introduction of @xcite . when @xmath3 is non - smooth",
    ", all the above mentioned methods cease to work . on non - smooth domains ,",
    "the most effective way to construct rbm is to use the dirichlet form method , which will be recalled in section [ s:2 ] .",
    "the rbm constructed through dirichlet form coincides with all the other standard definitions in smooth domains . using the dirichlet form approach , it can be shown that , when @xmath3 is a simply connected planar domain , rbm @xmath2 in @xmath3 is the time change of the conformal image of rbm in a unit disc .",
    "this paper is concerned with hausdorff dimensions of various random sets associated with rbm .",
    "the study of hausdorff dimensions of random sets associated with brownian motion , stable processes and more generally lvy processes together with their fractal structures has been an active research area in the last 40 years .",
    "see xiao @xcite for a recent survey on this subject .",
    "however , to the authors knowledge , this is the first time that such a study has been conducted for rbm in euclidean domains .",
    "the results obtained in this paper hold for a large class of non - smooth domains . in order to convey our results",
    "as transparently as possible , in this introductory section we confine ourselves to a special case of the more general results established in this paper by assuming that @xmath3 is a bounded _ uniform _ domain .",
    "the following definition is taken from visl @xcite , where various equivalent definitions are discussed .",
    "[ d:2.1 ] a domain @xmath1 is called uniform if there exists a constant @xmath8 such that for every @xmath9 there is a rectifiable curve @xmath10 joining @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath3 with @xmath13 and moreover @xmath14 for all points @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the euclidean distance between point @xmath17 and the set @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the classical van koch snowflake domain in the conformal mapping theory is a uniform domain in @xmath19 . the uniform domain is also called @xmath20-domain in the terminology of jones @xcite .",
    "note that every lipschitz domain is uniform , and every _ non - tangentially accessible domain _",
    "defined by jerison and kenig in @xcite is a uniform domain ( see ( 3.4 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the boundary of a uniform domain can be highly nonrectifiable and , in general , no regularity of its boundary can be inferred ( besides the easy fact that the hausdorff dimension of the boundary is strictly less than @xmath21 ) . for any @xmath22",
    ", one can construct a uniform domain @xmath1 such that @xmath23 for any open set @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 denotes the @xmath27-dimensional hausdorff measure in @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we first extend kaufman s uniform doubling dimension result @xcite for planar brownian motion to rbms in bounded domains .",
    "it follows as a special case of theorem [ t:2.1 ] below that for rbm @xmath2 in a bounded uniform domain @xmath1 , @xmath28 here @xmath29 denotes the range of @xmath30 under rbm @xmath2 and @xmath31 denotes the hausdorff dimension .",
    "such a result is called a _ uniform dimensional result _ because the exceptional set in ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) is independent of the borel time sets @xmath32 .",
    "this dependence is important when one wants to extract information on @xmath33 by observing @xmath30 only while @xmath30 itself is random , for example , when @xmath30 is the boundary occupation time set of @xmath2 .",
    "we next study the occupation time of @xmath2 on the boundary @xmath18 , @xmath34 corollary [ c:3.3 ] below implies that @xmath35 @xmath36-almost surely for every @xmath37 .",
    "note that for any euclidean domain @xmath1 , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this together with ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) implies that the hausdorff dimension of the boundary trace for rbm in @xmath3 is @xmath39 @xmath36-almost surely for every @xmath37 . in particular , for _ planar _ uniform domains ( such as the van koch snowflake )",
    "it follows that @xmath36-almost surely @xmath40 for every @xmath37 .",
    "this is in contrast to makarov s celebrated result about the support of harmonic measure : there is a subset @xmath41 of @xmath18 with @xmath42 such that the _ first _ intersection of @xmath2 with @xmath18 is almost surely contained in @xmath41 . in section [ s:5 ]",
    "an example of a ( non - uniform ) domain @xmath3 is given where the hausdorff dimension of the boundary trace of rbm in @xmath3 _ differs _ from @xmath43 .",
    "thus some assumption about the regularity of the domain is necessary for our results to hold .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the definitions of rbm and extension domains . in section 3 , we show that the sample paths of rbm have the same degree of hlder continuity as brownian motion , by using the lyons - zheng s forward - backward martingale decomposition of rbm .",
    "we then establish the uniform dimensional results for rbm on a large class of non - smooth euclidean domains .",
    "for this we derive the two - sided heat kernel estimates for rbm and use a capacitary argument . in the case of dimension",
    "@xmath44 , the logarithmic capacity is not good for our approach so we first subordinate the rbm , then establish dimensional results for the subordinated stable - like process and lastly transfer these results back to rbm . in this procedure , we use the recently obtained two - sided heat kernel estimates in chen and kumagai @xcite for stable - like processes on @xmath4 . in section 4 , we apply a recent result in bogdan , burdzy and chen @xcite to get the exact capacitary dimension of the boundary occupation time of rbm and therefore establish its hausdorff dimension .",
    "all these results are combined in section 5 to get the hausdorff dimension for the boundary trace of rbm .",
    "several examples are given to illustrate the main results of this paper as well as an example that shows that certain regularity assumptions on the domain @xmath3 are needed for the main results of this paper to hold .",
    "extensions of the main results in this paper to stable - like jump processes are mentioned in remarks [ r:2.8 ] , [ r:3.4 ] and [ r:4.2 ] .",
    "we point out here that the approach used in this paper is quite robust that applies not only to rbm but also to symmetric reflecting diffusions as well .",
    "these symmetric reflecting diffusions have infinitesimal generators of divergence form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a symmetric @xmath47 matrix - valued measurable function that is uniformly elliptic and bounded .",
    "see chen @xcite for relevant informations on symmetric reflecting diffusions on bounded domains , and stroock @xcite for two - sided heat kernel estimates for symmetric diffusions on @xmath5 .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath0 is an integer . for a domain @xmath1 ,",
    "let @xmath48 , equipped with the sobolev norm @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with reflecting brownian motion on domains @xmath1 whose boundary has zero lebesgue measure and have the following @xmath51-extension property : there is a bounded linear extension operator @xmath52    the @xmath53-domains ( also called locally uniform domains ) introduced by p. w. jones @xcite have this property . a domain is @xmath53 , if there are @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] such that the conditions in definition [ d:2.1 ] for uniform domains hold for @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , an @xmath20-domain is just a uniform domain . for later use , we record the following observation as a lemma .",

    "we can easily lift the rectifiable curve @xmath10 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in @xmath3 in the definition of @xmath63-domain for @xmath3 to a rectifiable curve from @xmath64 to @xmath65 that satisfies the @xmath53-condition for @xmath66 $ ] , with possibly different values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in the second case",
    ", we construct a point @xmath69 with @xmath70 such that @xmath71 , and then apply the first case to construct rectifiable curves joining @xmath64 with @xmath72 and @xmath72 with @xmath65 .",
    "the piecing together curve satisfies the condition for @xmath63-domain for @xmath66 $ ] , with possibly different values of @xmath73 and @xmath68 .    the importance of @xmath63-domains is further illustrated by the following .",
    "it is shown by jones @xcite that a finitely connected domain is a @xmath51-extension domain if and only if it is an @xmath53-domain . more information on domains that have the @xmath51-extension property ( [ eqn : extension ] )",
    "can be found in herron and koskela @xcite .    for @xmath74 ,",
    "define @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we say the dirichlet form @xmath77 is regular on @xmath4 if @xmath78 is dense both in @xmath79 and in @xmath80 .",
    "it is known ( cf .",
    "theorem 2 on p.14 in mazja @xcite ) that @xmath77 is a regular dirichlet form on @xmath4 if @xmath3 has continuous boundary .",
    "clearly @xmath81 is a regular dirichlet form on @xmath5 .",
    "so if @xmath3 is a @xmath51-extension domain , @xmath77 is regular on @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath77 is regular on @xmath4 , there is a strong markov process @xmath2 associated with @xmath82 , having continuous sample paths on @xmath4 ; one can construct a consistent markovian family of distributions for the process starting from every point in @xmath4 except possibly for a subset @xmath83 of @xmath18 having zero capacity ( see chen @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath3 is smooth , the exceptional set @xmath83 can be taken to be the empty set .",
    "we will show in section 3 ( see ( [ eqn : heat2 ] ) and lemma [ l:2.6 ] below ) that the exceptional set @xmath83 in fact can be taken to be the empty set for a large class of nonsmooth domains including @xmath53-domains .",
    "thus constructed process @xmath2 is the reflecting brownian motion on @xmath3 in the sense that this definition agrees with all other standard definitions in smooth domains . as it is remarked in bass , burdzy and chen @xcite",
    "( see the second paragraph in the proof of theorem 5.7 there ) , such reflecting brownian is conformally invariant on planar domains .",
