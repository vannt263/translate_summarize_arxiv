    "knot theory is not usually considered an algebraic subject , and one reason for this is that knots are not equipped with a rich enough algebraic structure .",
    "there are some operations defined on knots , most importantly connected sum and cabling , but even with these present , the space of knots is far from finitely generated , not to mention finitely presented .",
    "there is a way , however , to put knot theory in an algebraic context , by considering the larger , richer space of knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "ktgs include knots and links , and are equipped with four standard operations , called the orientation switch , edge delete , edge unzip , and connected sum . with these operations , ktgs form a finitely presented algebraic structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several topological knot properties , including knot genus and the ribbon property are definable by simple formulas in the space of ktgs @xcite .",
    "thus , invariants which are well - behaved with respect to the algebraic structure on ktgs could be used as algebraic tools to understand these knot properties .",
    "a construction of an almost - perfect such invariant has long been known ( @xcite , and later @xcite and even later @xcite ) : the kontsevich integral of knots can be extended to a universal finite type invariant ( or `` expansion '' ) @xmath0 of ktgs , and the extension is very well - behaved with respect to three of the four ktg operations . by ``",
    "very well - behaved '' , we mean that it intertwines those operations and their chord - diagrammatic counterparts , in other words , it is `` homomorphic '' with respect to those operations .",
    "however , @xmath0 fails to commute with the unzip operation , which plays a crucial role in the finite generation of ktgs .",
    "although the behavior of @xmath0 with respect to unzip is well - understood , it is not homomorphic , and it can be shown ( we do so in the appendix to this paper ) that any expansion of ktgs will display an anomaly like the above : it can not commute with all four operations at the same time .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to fix the anomaly by proposing a different definition of ktgs , which we will call `` dotted knotted trivalent graphs '' , or dktgs on which a truly homomorphic expansion exists .",
    "we present two ( equivalent ) constructions of this space . in one",
    "we replace the unzip , delete and connected sum operations by a more general set of operations called `` tree connected sums '' . in the other , we restrict the set of edges which we allow to be unzipped .",
    "we show that @xmath0 can easily be modified to produce a homomorphic expansion of dktgs , and that dktgs retain all the good qualities of ktgs , namely , finite generation and a close connection to drinfeld associators .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the value of this construction is not in extending @xmath0 to dotted ktgs , but in providing a new way of understanding and handling @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we show a simple ( free of associators and local considerations ) proof of the theorem that the lmo invariant is well behaved with respect to the kirby ii ( band - slide ) move .      the authors would like to thank some anonymous readers for many useful comments and for pointing out several gaps in an earlier version of this paper .",

    "the goal of this section is to introduce knotted trivalent graphs and reintroduce the theory of finite type invariants in a general algebraic context .",
    "we define general `` algebraic structures '' , `` projectivizations '' and `` expansions '' , with finite type invariants of knotted trivalent graphs ( and the special case of knots and links ) as an example .",
    "a _ trivalent graph _ is a graph which has three edges meeting at each vertex .",
    "we require that all edges be oriented and that vertices be equipped with a cyclic orientation , i.e. a cyclic ordering of the three half - edges meeting at the vertex .",
    "we allow multiple edges ; loops ( i.e. , edges that begin and end at the same vertex ) ; and circles ( i.e. edges without a vertex ) .    given a trivalent graph @xmath2 , its _ thickening _",
    "@xmath3 is obtained from it by `` thickening '' vertices as shown on the right , and gluing the resulting `` thick y s '' in an orientation preserving manner .",
    "hence , the thickening is an oriented two - dimensional surface with boundary . for it to be well - defined , we need the cyclic orientation at the vertices .",
    "a _ knotted trivalent graph ( ktg ) _ is an embedding of a thickened trivalent graph @xmath3 in @xmath4 , as shown .",
    "the _ skeleton _ of a ktg @xmath5 is the combinatorial object ( trivalent graph @xmath2 ) behind it .",
    "we consider ktgs up to isotopies that do not change the skeleton .",
    "the thickening is equivalent to saying that the edges of the graph are framed and the framings agree at vertices . in particular ,",
    "framed knots and links are knotted trivalent graphs . for a given trivalent graph @xmath2 ,",
    "let us denote all the knottings of @xmath2 ( i.e. , all ktgs with skeleton @xmath2 ) by @xmath6 .",
    "the reader may remember that framed knots are in one - to one correspondence with knot diagrams modulo the usual reidemeister moves @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as a weakened version of @xmath9 that we call @xmath10 , shown on the right .",
    "( @xmath10 does not change the framing but does change the winding number . )    isotopy classes of ktg s are in one to one correspondence with graph diagrams ( projections onto a plane with only transverse double points preserving the over- and under - strand information at the crossings ) , modulo the reidemeister moves @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 ( see for example @xcite ) . we understand the framing corresponding to a graph diagram to be the blackboard framing .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same as in the knot case .",
    "@xmath11 involves moving a strand in front of or behind a vertex :    figs / r4.pstex_t    there are four kinds of operations defined on ktg s :    given a trivalent graph @xmath2 , or a ktg @xmath12 , and an edge @xmath13 of @xmath2 , one can _ switch the orientation _ of @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the resulting graph by @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , we have defined unary operations @xmath15 .",
    "we can also _ delete _ the edge @xmath13 , which means the two vertices at the ends of @xmath13 also cease to exist to preserve the trivalence . to do this , it is required that the orientations of the two edges connecting to @xmath13 at either end match .",
    "this operation is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "_ unzipping _ the edge @xmath13 ( denoted by @xmath17 , see the figure below ) means replacing it by two edges that are `` very close to each other '' .",
    "the two vertices at the ends of @xmath13 will disappear .",
    "this can be imagined as cutting the band of @xmath13 in half lengthwise . in the case of a trivalent graph @xmath2",
    ", we consider its thickening @xmath3 and similarly cut the edge @xmath13 in half lengthwise .",
    "again , the orientations have to match , i.e. the edges at the vertex where @xmath13 begins have to both be incoming , while the edges at the vertex where @xmath13 ends must both be outgoing .    figs / unzip.pstex_t    given two graphs with selected edges @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the _ connected sum _ of these graphs along the two chosen edges , denoted @xmath20 , is obtained by joining @xmath13 and @xmath21 by a new edge . for this to be well - defined , we also need to specify the direction of the new edge , the cyclic orientations at each new vertex , and in the case of ktgs , the framing on the new edge .",
    "to compress notation , let us declare that the new edge be oriented from @xmath2 towards @xmath22 , have no twists , and , using the blackboard framing , be attached to the right side of @xmath13 and @xmath21 , as shown :    figs / connsum.pstex_t    the classical way of introducing finite type invariants for links , extended straightforwardly to ( framed ) ktgs , is as follows : we allow formal linear combinations of ktgs of the same skeleton , and to filter the resulting vector space by resolutions of singularities .",
    "an @xmath23-singular ktg is a trivalent graph immersed in @xmath24 with @xmath23 singular points : each may be a transverse double point or merely a highlighted point on one of the strands marked by a letter `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "a resolution of an @xmath23-singular ktg is obtained by replacing each double point by the difference of an over - crossing and an under - crossing , and each `` @xmath25-point '' by the difference between the graph obtained by its removal and by the graph obtained by replacing it with a 1-unit twist of framing ( see figure [ fig : ftfilt ] ) .",
    "this produces a linear combination of @xmath26 ktgs . the @xmath23-th piece of the finite type filtration @xmath27 is linearly generated by resolutions of @xmath23-singular immersions of the skeleton @xmath2 .",

    "chord diagram _ of order @xmath23 on a skeleton graph @xmath2 is a combinatorial object consisting of a pairing of @xmath32 points on the edges of @xmath2 , up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the edges .",
    "such a structure is illustrated by drawing @xmath23 `` chords '' between the paired points , as seen in the figure on the right .",
    "as in the finite type theory of links , a chord represents the difference of an over - crossing and an under - crossing ( i.e. a double point ) .",
    "this defines a map from chord diagrams to @xmath33 , which is well defined and surjective .",
    "there are two classes of relations that are in the kernel , the _ four term relations ( @xmath34 ) _",
    ":    figs/4t.pstex_t    and the _ vertex invariance relations ( @xmath35 ) _ , ( a.k.a . branching relation in @xcite ) :    figs / vi.pstex_t    in both pictures , there may be other chords in the parts of the graph not shown , but they have to be the same throughout . in 4 t , all skeleton parts ( solid lines ) are oriented counterclockwise . in @xmath35 , the sign @xmath36 is @xmath37 if the edge the chord is ending on is oriented to be outgoing from the vertex , and @xmath38 if it is incoming .",
    "both relations arise from similar local isotopies of ktgs :    although it is easy to see that these relations are present , showing that there are no more is difficult , and is best achieved by constructing a _ universal finite type invariant _",
    "@xmath39 ( we do not define universal finite type invariants here , but will do so later in the general context ) .",
    "this was first done in @xcite by extending the kontsevich integral @xmath1 of knots @xcite , building on results by t. le , h. murakami , j. murakami and t. ohtsuki and using drinfeld s theory of associators . in @xcite ,",
    "the same extension is constructed building on kontsevich s original definition . in this paper",

    "each operation of ktgs induces an operation on @xmath40 , as follows .",
    "given a graph @xmath2 and an edge @xmath13 , the induced orientation switch operation is a linear map @xmath41 which multiplies a chord diagram @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of chords in @xmath42 ending on @xmath13 .",
    "note that this generalizes the antipode map on jacobi diagrams , which corresponds to the orientation reversal of knots ( see @xcite , p.136 ) .",
    "the induced edge delete is a linear map @xmath45 , defined as follows : when the edge @xmath13 is deleted , all diagrams with a chord ending on @xmath13 are mapped to zero , while those with no chords ending on @xmath13 are left unchanged , except the edge @xmath13 is removed .",
    "edge delete is the generalization of the co - unit map of @xcite ( p.136 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the induced unzip is a linear map @xmath46",
    "when @xmath13 is unzipped , each chord that ends on it is replaced by a sum of two chords , one ending on each new edge ( i.e. , if @xmath44 chords end on @xmath13 , then @xmath47 sends this chord diagram to a sum of @xmath48 chord diagrams ) .",
    "there is an operation on @xmath49 corresponding to the cabling of knots : references include @xcite ( splitting map ) and @xcite ( co - multiplication ) . the graph unzip operation is the graph analogy of cabling , so the corresponding map is analogous as well .    for graphs @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath22 , with edges @xmath13 and @xmath50 , the induced connected sum @xmath51 acts in the obvious way , by performing the connected sum operation on the skeletons and not changing the chords in any way .",
    "this is well defined due to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 relations .",
    "( what needs to be proven is that we can move a chord ending over the attaching point of the new edge ; this is done in the same spirit as the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite , using `` hooks '' ; see also @xcite , figure 4 . )",
    "an _ algebraic structure _",
    "@xmath52 is some collection @xmath53 of sets of objects of different kinds , where the subscript @xmath54 denotes the _ kind _ of the objects in @xmath55 , along with some collection of _ operations _",
    "@xmath56 , where each @xmath56 is an arbitrary map with domain some product @xmath57 of sets of objects , and range a single set @xmath58 ( so operations may be unary or binary or multi - nary , but they always return a value of some fixed kind ) .",
    "we also allow some named _ constants _ within some @xmath59 s ( or equivalently , allow some 0-nary operations ) .",
    "the operations may or may not be subject to `` axioms ''  an _ axiom _ is an identity asserting that some composition of operations is equal to some other composition of operations .",
    "for example , ktgs form an algebraic structure that has a different kind of objects for each skeleton .",
    "the sets of objects are the sets of knottings @xmath60 for each skeleton graph @xmath2 , and there are four operations , three unary and one binary .",
    "ktgs are finitely generated ( see @xcite ) , by two elements , the trivially embedded tetrahedron and the twisted tetrahedron , shown on the right ( note that these only differ in framing ) .",
    "any algebraic structure @xmath52 has a _ projectivization_. first extend @xmath52 to allow formal linear combinations of objects of the same kind ( extending the operations in a linear or multi - linear manner ) , then let @xmath61 , the _ augmentation ideal _ , be the sub - structure made out of all such combinations in which the sum of coefficients is @xmath62 .",

    "the main new feature in @xmath68 is that it is a `` graded '' structure ; we denote the degree @xmath64 piece @xmath69 of @xmath70 by @xmath71 .    for example",
    ", in the case of ktgs , allow formal @xmath72-linear combinations of ktgs of the same skeleton and extend the operations linearly .",
    "the augmentation ideal @xmath61 is generated by differences of knotted trivalent graphs of the same skeleton .",

    "the finite type theory of knots and links is included in the finite type theory of ktgs as a special case . on knots , there is no rich enough algebraic structure for the finite type filtration to coincide with powers of the augmentation ideal with respect to some operations .",
    "however , knots and links form a subset of ktgs , and the restriction of @xmath77 to that subset reproduces the usual theory of finite type invariants of knots and links , and @xmath0 restricts to the kontsevich integral .",

    ". therefore , in the theory of ktgs , the word `` expansion '' means `` universal finite type invariant '' .",
    "a `` homomorphic expansion '' is an expansion which also commutes with all the algebraic operations defined on the algebraic structure @xmath52 .    for ktgs",
    ", it turns out ( see @xcite ) that @xmath0 is almost homomorphic : it intertwines the orientation switch , edge delete , and connected sum operations .",
    "however , @xmath0 does not commute with edge unzip .",
    "the behavior with respect to unzip is well - understood ( showed in @xcite using a result of @xcite ) , and is described by the formula shown in the figure on the right . here",
    ", @xmath86 denotes the kontsevich integral of the unknot .",
    "a formula for @xmath86 was conjectured in @xcite and proven in @xcite .",
    "the new chord combinations appearing on the right commute with all the old chord endings by 4 t .",
    "a different way to phrase this formula is that @xmath0 intertwines the unzip operation @xmath87 with a `` renormalized '' chord diagram operation @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes the operation of placing a factor of @xmath91 on @xmath13 , @xmath47 is the chord - diagram unzip operation induced by the topological unzip , and @xmath92 places factors of @xmath93 on each `` daughter edge '' .",
    "so we have @xmath94 .",
    "this is an anomaly : if @xmath0 was honestly homomorphic , there should be no new chords appearing , i.e. , @xmath1 should intertwine unzip and its induced chord diagram operation .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to fix this .",
    "before we re - define @xmath73 , let us note that doing so is really necessary :    [ nonexistence ] there is no homomorphic expansion @xmath95 , i.e. an expansion can not intertwine all four operations at once .    to keep an optimistic outlook in this paper ,",

    "we define the algebraic structure @xmath96 of _ dotted knotted trivalent graphs _ as follows :    a _ dotted trivalent graph _ is a graph which may have trivalent vertices , and two kinds of bivalent vertices , called dots , and anti - dots , the latter are denoted by crosses .",
    "dots and crosses are part of the skeleton information .",

    "distinguished trees @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the _ tree connected sum _",
    "@xmath104 is obtained by deleting the two trees , and joining corresponding ends by bivalent vertices , as shown .",
    "the orientations of the new edges are inherited from the leaves of the trees .",
    "we leave it to the reader to check that this operation is well - defined .",
    "figs / tcs.pstex_t    we allow the distinguished trees to have dots and anti - dots on them , with the restriction that for each dot ( resp .",
    "anti - dot ) on @xmath102 , @xmath103 is required to have an anti - dot ( resp .",
    "dot ) in the same position .",
    "the _ cancel _ operation @xmath105 is defined when a @xmath96 has a dot @xmath106 and an adjacent anti - dot @xmath107 , in which case _ cancel _ deletes both ( as in the figure below ) .",
    "this requires the orientations of the three fused edges to agree .",
    "figs / cancel.pstex_t    [ lem : fingen ] dktgs with the above operations form a finitely generated algebraic structure .",
    "we will show that orientation switch , unzip , delete and `` edge connected sum '' ( that is , a connected sum operation followed by unzipping the connecting edge ) are compositions of the new operations . in the proof that @xmath73 is finitely generated ( see @xcite ) , a connected sum is always followed by an unzip , so edge connected sum is sufficient for finite generation . furthermore , we need to show that it is possible to add dots and anti - dots using tree connected sum , which then also allows one to delete any dots or anti - dots using the cancel operation .",
    "orientation switch is an operation of @xmath96s , so we have nothing to prove .    unzip can be written as a tree connected sum the following way :    the graph on the right is almost @xmath108 , except for the dots which result from the tree connected sum .",
    "so to show that unzip can be written as a composition of the new operations , it is enough to show that it is possible to `` get rid of '' dots .",
    "this is achieved by taking a tree connected sum with a circle with three crosses and then canceling :    edge delete and edge connected sum are done similarly , as illustrated by the figure below :    we have shown above that to add one anti - dot we need to take tree connected sum with a circle with three anti - dots and a trivial tree ( since the tree connected sum produces two dots which then have to be canceled ) .",
    "similarly , to add one dot , we apply tree connected sum with a circle which has one anti - dot on it .    using that @xmath73",
    "is finitely generated by the two tetrahedrons , we have now shown that @xmath96 is finitely generated by the following four elements :    the reader might object that tree connected sum is infinitely many operations under one name , so it is not fair to claim that the structure is finitely generated .",
    "however , only two of these ( the tree needed for unzip and delete , and the trivial tree used for edge connected sum and vertex addition ) are needed for finite generation .",
    "later we will show a slightly different construction in which we only use the operations that are essential , however , we felt that tree connected sums are more natural and thus chose this version to be the starting point .",
    "as before , the associated graded space has a kind of objects for each skeleton dotted trivalent graph @xmath2 , denoted @xmath75 , generated by chord diagrams on the skeleton @xmath2 , and factored out by the usual @xmath34 and @xmath35 relations , the latter of which now applies to dots and anti - dots as well , shown here for dots :    orientation reversal acts the same way as it does for ktgs : if there are @xmath44 chord endings on the edge that is being reversed , the diagram gets multiplied by @xmath43 .",
    "the tree connected sum operation acts on @xmath109 the following way : if any chords end on the distinguished trees , we first use the vi relation to push them off the trees .",
    "once the trees are free of chord endings , we join the skeletons as above , creating bivalent vertices .",
    "again , this operation is well - defined .",
    "the cancel operation deletes a bivalent vertex and an anti - vertex on the same edge , without any change to chord endings .",
    "[ homexp ] there exists a homomorphic expansion @xmath1 on the space of dktgs , obtained from the @xmath0 of @xcite and @xcite by placing a @xmath91 near each dot and @xmath93 near each anti - dot .",
    "first , note that @xmath1 is well - defined : it does not matter which side of a dot ( resp .",
    "anti - dot ) we place @xmath91 ( resp .",
    "@xmath93 ) on : if one edge is incoming , the other outgoing , then these are equal by the @xmath35 relation , otherwise they are equal by the @xmath35 relation and the fact that @xmath110 , where @xmath111 denotes the orientation switch operation .",
    "( this is because the trivially framed oriented unknot is isotopic to itself with the opposite orientation . )",
    "since @xmath0 is an expansion of ktgs , it follows that @xmath1 is an expansion . for homomorphicity",
    ", we must show that @xmath1 commutes with the orientation switch , cancel and tree connected sum operations .",
    "orientation switch and cancel are easy .",
    "if an edge ends in two trivalent vertices , then on that edge @xmath1 coincides with @xmath0 and hence commutes with switching the orientation .",
    "if one or both ends of the edge are bivalent , then @xmath1 might differ from @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath86 ( or two ) , but still commutes with @xmath111 by the fact that @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath1 commutes with cancel because the values of the dot and anti - dot are inverses of each other ( and local , therefore commute with all other chord endings and cancel each other out ) .    in terms of the `` old '' ktg operations ( disregarding the dots for a moment , and ignoring edge orientation issues ) , a tree connected sum can be realized by one ordinary connected sum followed by a series of unzips :    we want to prove that @xmath112 . to compute the left side , we trace @xmath0 through the operations above .",
    "we assume that the trees have been cleared of chord endings in the beginning using the @xmath35 relation ( and of course chords that end outside the trees remain unchanged throughout ) . @xmath0 commutes with connected sum , so in the first step , no chords appear on the trees . in the second step ,",
    "we unzip the bridge connecting the two graphs . as mentioned before",
    ", @xmath0 intertwines unzip with @xmath113 .",
    "it is a simple fact of chord diagrams on ktgs that any chord diagram with a chord ending on a bridge is @xmath62 , thus the first operation @xmath90 is the identity in this case . after",
    "the bridge is unzipped , @xmath92 places @xmath93 on the two resulting edges .",
    "the next time we apply @xmath114 , @xmath90 cancels this out , the edge is unzipped , and then again @xmath93 is placed on the daughter edges , and so on , until there are no more edges to unzip . the operation @xmath90",
    "will always cancel a @xmath93 from a previous step .",
    "therefore , at the end , the result is one factor of @xmath93 on each of the connecting edges .",
    "we get @xmath115 by placing a dot on each of the connecting edges in the result of the above sequence of operations .",
    "@xmath1 adds a factor of @xmath91 at each dot , which cancels out each @xmath93 that came from the unzips .",
    "thus , @xmath116 has no chords on the connecting edges , which is exactly what we needed to prove .",
    "let us note that edge orientations can indeed be ignored : for the unzips used above to be legitimate , a number of orientation switch operations are needed , but since @xmath110 , the action of these on any chord diagram that appears in the calculation above is trivial .",
    "if the trees had dots and anti - dots to begin with , provided that for every dot ( resp .",
    "anti - dot ) on @xmath102 , @xmath103 had an anti - dot ( resp.dot ) in the same position , these will cancel each other out , and we have already seen that @xmath1 commutes with the cancel operation .",
    "let the space dktg have the same objects as dktg , but we define the operations differently .",
    "we keep _ orientation reversal _ and _ cancel _ the same .",
    "instead of tree connected sums , we introduce the following three operations :    _ edge delete _ is the same as in the space @xmath73 , i.e. , if orientations match , we can delete an edge connecting two trivalent vertices , and as a result , those vertices disappear .",
    "_ dotted unzip _ allows unzips of an edge connecting two trivalent vertices with one dot on it ( technically , two edges ) , provided that orientations match at the trivalent vertices , as shown :    _ dotted edge connected sum _ is the same as edge connected sum , except dots appear where edges are `` fused '' ( and there are no conditions on edge orientations ) :    alternatively , one can allow dotted connected sums ( a connected sum where a dot appears on the connecting edge ) . in this case , this construction is slightly stronger than the previous one , as dotted connected sum can not be written in terms of the operations of the first construction .",
    "dotted edge connected sum is the composition of a dotted connected sum with a dotted unzip .",
    "the associated graded space is as in the case of dktg , and the induced operations on it are the same for orientation reversal and cancel ; are as in the case of ktgs for delete and dotted unzip ; and are as one would expect for dotted edge connected sum ( no new chords appear ) .",
    "the two constructions are equivalent in the sense that every dktg operation can be written as a composition of dktg operations and every dktg operation is a composition of dktg operations , involving some constants ( namely , a dumbbell graph and a trivially embedded theta graph , as shown in the proof ) .    for the first direction we only need to show that a tree connected sum can be written as a composition of dktg operations .",
    "we have essentially done this before , in the proof of lemma [ lem : fingen ] .",
    "the composition of operations required is one dotted edge connected sum , followed by a succession of dotted unzips , and orientation switches which we are ignoring for simplicity ( as noted before , they do nt cause any trouble ) :    for the second direction , we need to write edge delete , dotted unzip and dotted edge connected sum as a composition of dktg operations .",
    "dotted edge connected sum is a special case of tree connected sum ( with trees consisting of a single line segment ) .",
    "dotted unzip and edge delete are tree connected sums with given graphs and given trees , similar to the proof of lemma [ lem : fingen ] , shown below :    [ hom ] @xmath1 is a homomorphic expansion of dktg.    it is obvious from the homomorphicity of @xmath1 on dktg that @xmath1 commutes with orientation switch , cancel , and dotted edge connected sum .    since dotted unzip and edge delete are unary operations , to show that @xmath1 commutes with them , we need to verify that the values of @xmath1 on given graphs we used to produce these operations from tree connected sums are trivial , shown here for edge delete : @xmath117 here , @xmath118 denotes the `` dumbbell '' graph with four anti - dots , shown above .",
    "if @xmath119 , and provided that the edge to be deleted was cleared of chords previously , using the @xmath35 relation , then the right side of the equation equals exactly @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath0 of the trivially embedded dumbbell ( with no anti - dots ) has a factor of @xmath86 on each circle , @xmath121 is indeed @xmath122 , since two anti - dots add a factor of @xmath123 on each circle .",
    "unzip is done in an identical argument , where we use that the @xmath1 value of a trivially embedded theta - graph with one cross on each strand is 1 .",

    "an associator is called _ horizontal _ if it lives in the sub - algebra @xmath174 , consisting of chord diagrams made only of horizontal chords .",
    "the associator we construct here is not a horizontal chord associator , however , it possesses the following crucial property of horizontal chord associators : @xmath175 , where @xmath176 .",
    "this , in fact , is the only consequence of horizontality needed in @xcite .",
    "the figure on the right shows this property in the other notation .",
    "[ def : evenness ] @xmath143 is _ even _ or _ vertically unitary _ , meaning @xmath143 `` upside down '' is @xmath150 : @xmath177 , equivalently @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .",
    "3 .   we will prove that the associator we construct has an additional symmetry , as shown in the figure below , which we call _ rotational symmetry _ :",
    "@xmath180 , where @xmath181 .",
    "this arises from the order @xmath182 rotational symmetry of the tetrahedron , and the reader can check that indeed @xmath183 .",
    "this property is rather unsightly when written in the other notation , nevertheless it is shown on the right .",
    "[ rem : spanningtree ] note that for any chord diagram on a dktg skeleton , one can pick any spanning tree and use the @xmath35 relation to `` sweep it free of chords '' .",
    "( in a slight abuse of notation , by a vertex we shall mean a trivalent vertex , and by an edge , and edge connecting two trivalent vertices , which may have dots and crosses on it , so it may really be a path . )",
    "this `` sweeping trick '' induces a ( well - defined ) isomorphism from chord diagrams on a dktg with a specified spanning tree to some @xmath128 .",
    "for example , there is an isomorphism from chord diagrams on a trivially embedded tetrahedron to @xmath138 , as shown in the figure on the right .",
    "we can now state and prove that we have constructed an associator :    [ assoc ] the following @xmath143 and @xmath184 satisfy the pentagon and hexagon equations , as well as properties @xmath165  @xmath185 , and therefore @xmath143 is a ( nice ) associator : @xmath186    ( 0pt,0pt)(0cm,1cm)[r ]    note that the tetrahedron shown above is isotopic to the picture on the right , which might remind the reader more of the usual representation of an associator .",
    "the reader may wonder if this is a new construction for an associator @xmath143 .",
    "the answer is that it somewhat depends on how we pick the invariant @xmath0 at the start of our discussion .",
    "if we take it from @xcite , we must note that @xcite s construction in itself starts with an associator , which we will call here @xmath187 .",
    "one may show that if @xmath187 is even ( or vertically unitary , see ( [ def : evenness ] ) above ) , then @xmath188 and we got nothing new . but even if @xmath187 is not vertically unitary , our @xmath143 here is vertically unitary ( and satisfies all other properties ( 1)-(5 ) above ) , so in that case @xmath189 .",
    "yet note that in the process of constructing @xmath143 from @xmath187 we multiply by several normalization factors and hence we can not guarantee that @xmath143 will consist only of horizontal chords .",
    "finally , if we take @xmath0 from @xcite , then no associator is used explicitly within its construction , yet the normalization procedures employed in @xcite are equivalent to an implicit construction of the standard `` kz '' associator @xmath190 followed by the @xcite procedure with seed @xmath191 . since @xmath190 is not vertically unitary , in that case @xmath192 ,",
    "@xmath143 satisfies ( 1)-(5 ) above , yet @xmath143 is not necessarily made entirely of horizontal chords .",
    "we first prove that @xmath143 satisfies the pentagon equation . in the proof",
    ", we will use the `` vertex connected sum '' operation shown in the figure on the right .",
    "this can be thought of either as a tree connected sum in the first model , or the composition of a dotted connected sum composed with dotted unzips in the second model .",
    "now let us consider the following sequence of operations . in each step",
    ", we are thinking of @xmath1 of the pictured graph , which commutes with all the operations . to save space , we will not write out the @xmath1 s .    since @xmath1 is homomorphic , the result of this sequence of operations is @xmath193 the left side of the pentagon equation .    for the right side",
    ", we perform a vertex connected sum of two tetrahedra :    the result can be written as @xmath194 , the right side of the pentagon equation .",
    "since the two resulting dktgs are isotopic ( trivially embedded triangular prisms with crosses in the same positions ) , the two results have to be equal , and therefore @xmath143 satisfies the pentagon equation .",
    "morally , the hexagon equation amounts to adding a twist to one of the tetrahedra in the right side of the pentagon , on the middle crossed edge , which produces a triangular prism with a twist on the middle vertical edge .",
    "unzipping this edge then gives a new twisted tetrahedron .",
    "more precisely , we carry this out in a similar fashion to the proof of the pentagon . for the left side of the first hexagon equation we take vertex connected sum of two tetrahedra with a twisted theta graph :    the result is @xmath195 , the left side of the first hexagon equation .    for the right side , we need to add an extra strand to the twisted theta graphs .",
    "this can be done without changing the value of @xmath1 : we have mentioned before that the @xmath1- value of a trivially embedded theta graph with one cross on each strand is 1 .",
    "adding an extra strand can be realized by taking an edge connected sum with such a theta graph :    on to the right side of the hexagon equation , we now connect a tetrahedron with two twisted theta graphs with an added strand , and unzip .",
    "the reader can check that moving the extra strand from one side to the other can be done by an isotopy .",
    "the result reads @xmath196 , the right hand side of the hexagon .",
    "is is apparent that the resulting twisted tetrahedron graphs of the left and right sides are isotopic , proving that @xmath143 and @xmath184 satisfy the first hexagon equation .    for the second hexagon ,",
    "we first show that @xmath197 by taking a vertex connected sum with @xmath184 :    note that the resulting graph is isotopic to a trivially embedded theta - graph with one cross on each edge .",
    "we have seen at the end of the proof of proposition [ hom ] that @xmath1 evaluated on this graph is trivial , which proves the claim .",
    "for a proof of the second hexagon equation , one substitutes the picture for @xmath198 in place of @xmath184 everywhere .",
    "it is easy to check from the definition of @xmath1 ( for details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.1 ) ) , that @xmath199 . if one requires this additional property of @xmath184 , then the strand swap of the second hexagon equation may be omitted .",
    "in fact @xmath184 , when thought of as a chord diagram on two strands , has only horizontal chords .",
    "more specifically , @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is a chord connecting the two strands .",
    "see also aside [ nonoriented ] .    now on to proving the additional symmetry properties :    1 .   to show non - degeneracy ,",
    "observe that by homomorphicity @xmath202 deleting any of the numbered edges from the tetrahedron yields a theta - graph with one cross on each edge , and , as mentioned before , the value of @xmath1 on this graph is indeed @xmath122 .",
    "2 .   horizontal unitarity follows from the fact that @xmath143 satisfies the hexagon equations and that @xmath199 , as proven in @xcite proposition 3.7 , or @xcite proposition 3.5 .",
    "+ alternatively , observe that @xmath203 is the horizontal mirror image of @xmath150 , and @xmath1 is invariant under taking mirror images for dktgs with no crossings .",
    "this follows from the definition of @xmath0 , which is based on the original construction of the kontsevich integral : for details see @xcite , chapter 5.1 .",
    "the horizontal - like property has the following pictorial proof : + in the first step , we are deleting the un - numbered edge which carries a cross . the second step does nt change the @xmath1-value of the graph ( as an element of @xmath138 ) , since we are taking a connected sum with a dktg with a trivial @xmath1-value .",
    "the rest follows from homomorphicity .",
    "the @xmath1-value of the graph on the right is , on one hand , the same as required in the statement , as an element of @xmath149 , on the other hand , it is the theta - graph with three crosses , which has trivial value .",
    "4 .   evenness follows from unitarity : the graphs representing @xmath204 and @xmath203 are isotopic .",
    "finally , rotational symmetry is due to the rotational symmetry of the tetrahedron .",
    "the right hand side of the figure below is the same as the formula in the statement .      as a small detour",
    ", we note that @xmath199 could also be deduced from the properties of a homomorphic expansion , if defined slightly more generally . in this paper",
    "we work with ktgs that are oriented surfaces embedded in @xmath24 .",
    "however , one could allow non - oriented surfaces , with a slight modification of the methods presented here . in this case",
    ", the moebius band replaces the twisted tetrahedron as a generator of the space of dktgs .",
    "the notation needs to be modified as blackboard framed graph diagrams are not enough in this case : we need an additional feature , the `` half twist '' , which comes in left and right varieties , and the vertex orientations need to be specified at each vertex ( see the example on the right ) . as for reidemeister moves ,",
    "the half twists can move freely behind and in front of crossings and across dots and crosses .",
    "there are a few additional relations : one can move a twist across a vertex , two twists equal a kink , and two opposite twists cancel , shown below for one direction :    figs / nonorientedrels.pstex_t    the homomorphic expansion is constructed from @xmath0 by first ignoring the twists , then placing a factor of @xmath205 for each right twist and @xmath206 for each left twist , where @xmath207 is a short ( local ) chord on the appropriate strand ( as well as the appropriate @xmath86 factors on dots and crosses ) .    in this notation , the twisted theta graph representing @xmath184 is isotopic to the graph shown on the right .",
    "the @xmath1-value of the trivially embedded theta with three crosses is @xmath122 , as shown before , so the value of this graph is @xmath206 on the first two strands and @xmath205 on the third , which is symmetric when pushed onto the first two strands : by the vertex invariance relation it equals @xmath208 , as stated before .",
    "in @xcite le , murakami , murakami and ohtsuki construct an invariant @xmath209 of links which induces an invariant of @xmath182-manifolds , which was recently _ falsely _ disputed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key step is proving that @xmath209 is invariant under the kirby band - slide move @xmath210 , shown below :    the problem is that this move is not a well - defined operation of links , so somewhat cumbersome local considerations ( `` freezing '' local pictures or fixing bracketings ) need to be used .",
    "@xmath209 is defined to be a normalized version of the classical kontsevich integral @xmath1 , where an extra factor of @xmath86 is placed on each link component .",
    "using our language , let us consider the sub - structure of dktg whose objects are links with possibly one @xmath211-graph component , where circles are required to have two dots on them , and the @xmath211-graph component is required to have one dot on each edge .",
    "the only operation we allow is unzipping edges of the @xmath211-graph .",
    "we think of the theta as the two link components on which we want to perform @xmath210 , `` fused together '' at the place where we perform the operation . unzipping the middle edge of the theta",
    "gives back the original link ( before @xmath210 ) , while unzipping a side edge produces the link after @xmath210 is performed .",
    "the invariance under @xmath210 is then a direct consequence of the homomorphicity of @xmath1 with respect to dotted unzip , as summarized by the figure on the right .",
    "note that in this case @xmath1 is indeed @xmath209 when restricted further to links , via replacing the dots by their values of @xmath91 .",
    "in summary , we have proven the following :    [ k2 ] there exists an expansion @xmath209 for links with possibly one knotted theta component , which is homomorphic with respect to unzipping any edge of the theta component . when restricted to link ( with no thetas )",
    ", @xmath209 agrees with the invariant @xmath209 of @xcite .",
    "the reader may verify that the unzip property of theorem [ k2 ] is exactly the equivariance property required for the use of @xmath209 in the construction of an invariant of rational homology spheres , see @xcite .",
    "* proof of theorem [ augm ] .",
    "* let us denote the @xmath23-th piece of the classical finite type filtration by @xmath212 , and the augmentation ideal by @xmath76 .",

    "the other direction , @xmath219 is true due to the fact that one can get to any knotting of a given trivalent graph ( skeleton ) from any other through a series of crossing changes .    to prove that @xmath220 , we use that @xmath221 . recall that @xmath222 is generated by `` formulas '' containing @xmath23 @xmath122-singular ktgs , possibly some further non - singular ktgs , joined by connected sums ( the only binary operation ) , and possibly with some other operations ( unzips , deletes , orientation switches ) applied .",
    "the connected sum of a @xmath44-singular and an @xmath223-singular ktg is a @xmath224-singular ktg .",
    "it remains to check that orientation switch , delete and unzip do not decrease the number of double points .",
    "switching the orientation of an edge with a double point only introduces a negative sign . unzipping an edge with a double point on it produces a sum of two graphs with the same number of double points . deleting an edge with a double point on it produces zero .",
    "thus , an element in @xmath222 is @xmath23-singular , therefore contained in @xmath212 .",
    "the last step is to show that @xmath225 , i.e. , that one can write any @xmath23-singular ktg as @xmath23 1-singular , and possibly some further non - singular ktgs with a series of operations applied to them .",
    "the proof is in the same vein as proving that ktgs are finitely generated @xcite , as illustrated here by the example of a @xmath226-singular knotted theta - graph , shown on the right . in the figures ,",

    "note that one is tempted to take connected sums along all dotted edges , but this would be a mistake : connected sum can only connect separate connected components , adding an edge to a connected graph is not well - defined ; hence the slight awkwardness on choosing a `` spanning tree '' is necessary .",
