    "strongly interacting matter at sufficiently high energy density is predicted to exist in a phase of quasi - free quarks and gluons , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions provide a unique opportunity to check this prediction and study properties of the transition to the qgp as well as the qgp itself .",
    "this is because the system created in a+a collisions is close to ( at least local ) equilibrium .",
    "the conclusion is based on the success of statistical and hydrodynamical models of particle production at high energies ( see e.g. ref .",
    "consequently , properties of the system ( matter ) can be characterized by its equation of state which should include different phases and transitions between them .",
    "it is important to note that nowadays there is no dynamical understanding of the observed equilibrium properties of particle production in a+a collisions .    with increasing collision energy the energy density of matter created at the early stage of a+a collisions increases .",
    "thus , at a sufficiently high collision energy the matter is expected to be created in the qgp phase .",
    "the beginning of the qgp creation with increasing collision energy is referred to as the onset of deconfinement .",
    "the experimental search for the onset of deconfinement in central pb+pb collisions was performed by the na49 experiment at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) of the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) about 15 years ago .",
    "the study was motivated  @xcite by predictions of the statistical model of the early stage ( smes )  @xcite of a+a collisions . according to the model",
    "the onset of deconfinement in central a+a collisions should lead to rapid changes of the energy dependence of several hadron production properties , all located in a common energy domain . in particular , a non - monotonic dependence of the strangeness to entropy ratio as a function of the collision energy ( the _ horn _ ) was predicted  @xcite as an important signal of the transition .",
    "this and other predictions of the smes were confirmed by na49  @xcite .",
    "moreover , following results from the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern agree with the na49 results and their interpretation ( see ref .",
    "the smes predictions and the experimental evidence for the onset of deconfinement are presented in recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "the smes is probably the simplest model of the onset of deconfinement .",
    "this leads to a number of advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in particular , the smes is frequently criticized for being based on simple assumptions which can not be justified within popular dynamical approaches to a+a collisions .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a single aspect of the smes which concerns the finite size effects for strange hadron production .",
    "the smes predictions for strangeness production were calculated within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "this approximation is valid for central pb+pb collisions at the sps energies in which mean multiplicity of particles with non - zero strange charge is significantly larger than one .",
    "however , this is not the case for inelastic p+p interactions at the sps energies .",
    "here the exact strangeness conservation has to be imposed using the canonical ensemble ( ce )  @xcite .",
    "recently , the na61/shine collaboration at the cern sps published results on hadron production in p+p interactions  @xcite .",
    "they suggest that in these reactions the strangeness to entropy ratio ( experimentally replaced by the @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratio ) also changes rapidly in the sps energy range , see fig .  [",
    "fig : onset ] .",
    "however , the ratio and its energy dependence are significantly different from the _ horn _ measured in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "can these results be explained by the onset of deconfinement as modelled by the smes ?",
    "the first step towards an answer to this question is taken in this paper by introducing the exact strangeness conservation . in order to allow for a direct comparison with the previously published predictions , the remaining smes assumptions , parameters and notations",
    "are kept unchanged .",
    "the _ horn _ structure in the energy dependence of the k@xmath2 ratio is interpreted as evidence for the onset of deconfinement located at low cern sps energies .",
    "the structure was first discovered by na49 in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "surprisingly its shadow is visible in inelastic p+p interactions as indicated by the new na61/shine data . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - gce ] the gce formulation of the smes is briefly recapitulated .",
    "the exact strangeness conservation is introduced in the smes in sec .",
    "[ sec - ce ] and results for p+p interactions and collisions of small nuclei are presented . a summary in sec .",
    "[ sec - sum ] closes the article .",
    "the smes model was formulated almost 20 years ago .",
    "its basic assumptions , parameters and results are summarized in this section .",
    "together with the notation used in the original paper they are here kept unchanged as much as possible in order to allow for a direct comparison with the previously published results .",
    "the smes assumes that the matter created at the early stage of collisions has zero conserved charges .",
    "consequently , its properties are entirely defined by the available energy and the volume in which production takes place . in central a+a collisions this volume is chosen as the lorentz contracted volume occupied by the colliding nucleons ( participant nucleons ) from a single nucleus : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nucleon mass , @xmath5 is the center of mass energy of the nucleon pair , @xmath6 is the number of participant nucleons from a single nucleus .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is taken to be 1.30  fm in order to fit the mean baryon density in the nucleus , @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "only a fraction , @xmath10 , of the total energy in a+a collisions is transformed into the energy of new degrees of freedom created at the early stage .",
    "this is because a part of the energy is carried by the net baryon number .",
    "the released ( inelastic ) energy is expressed as @xmath11 where the parameter @xmath10 is assumed to be independent of the collision energy and the system size .",
    "the value of @xmath10 used for numerical calculations is 0.67  @xcite .",
    "assumptions  ( [ volume ] ) and  ( [ e ] ) with @xmath12 correspond to the landau hydrodynamical model  @xcite . similarly to this model , in the smes we do not consider dynamical mechanisms leading to a fast thermalization of the matter .",
    "the smes model postulates that the creation of new particles at the early stage of collision is a statistical process , namely , all microscopic states allowed by conservation laws is equally probable .",
    "the smes predictions for the pion multiplicities are based on the assumption that the entropy generated at the early stage of collision is ( approximately ) conserved during the expansion of produced matter .",
    "it was indeed observed that the dissipative effects estimated by the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density are small for the strongly interacting matter , especially in a region of the deconfinement transition ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it should be also noted that particle interactions play rather different role for the equilibrium properties ( e.g. , the equation of state ) and the kinetic coefficients ( e.g. , the shear viscosity ) .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by a simple example of the hard balls system  @xcite .",
    "the hard core particle radius @xmath13 leads to small corrections to the ideal gas equation of state due to the excluded volume effects , but the shear viscosity as it behaves as @xmath14 and thus it is strongly dependent on  @xmath13",
    ".    the elementary particles of strong interactions are quarks and gluons .",
    "the deconfined state is considered to be composed of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks and the corresponding anti - quarks each with internal number of degrees of freedom equal to 6 ( 3 color states and 2 spin states ) .",
    "the contribution of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks is neglected due to their large masses .",
    "the internal number of degrees of freedom for gluons is 16 ( 8 color states and 2 spin states ) .",
    "the masses of gluons and non - strange ( anti)quarks are taken to be 0 .",
    "the strange ( anti)quark mass is taken to be 175  mev  @xcite .",
    "the properties of equilibrated matter are characterized by an equation of state ( eos ) . for the case of quarks and gluons the bag model eos",
    "is used  @xcite , i.e. , the ideal gas eos modified by a bag constant @xmath21 .",
    "this equilibrium state of quarks and gluons is called the quark gluon plasma or q state .",
    "the smes uses an effective parametrization of the confined hadron state , denoted as w state .",
    "the non - strange degrees of freedom which dominate the entropy production are taken to be massless bosons .",
    "their internal number of degrees of freedom is taken to be 16 i.e. , about 3 times lower than the internal number of effective degrees of freedom in the qgp .",
    "the mass of strange degrees of freedom is assumed to be 500  mev , equal to the kaon mass .",
    "the internal number of strange degrees of freedom is assumed to be 14 .",
    "for the w - state the ideal gas eos is selected .",
    "clearly , this description of the confined state should only be treated as an effective parametrization .",
    "the numerical values of the parameters are fixed by fitting a+a data at the ags , see for details ref .",
    "the model assumes that always the maximum entropy state is created at the early stage of a+a collisions . in the model with two different states ( w and q ) the form of maximum state changes with the collision energy .",
    "the regions in which the equilibrium state is in the form of a pure w or a pure q state , are separated by the region in which both states coexist ( the mixed phase ) .",
    "the maximum entropy condition is equivalent to the assumption of the first order phase transitions with the gibbs criterion for the mixed phase ( see appendix b in ref .",
    "namely at a given temperature @xmath22 the system occupies a pure phase w or q whose pressure is larger , the mixed phase is formed if both pressures are equal @xmath23 .",
    "the transition temperature between the w and q phases is assumed to be @xmath24  mev .    using the assumptions and parameters defined above predictions of the smes",
    "can be calculated .",
    "the early stage energy density reads : @xmath25 the pressure and energy density functions in the w - phase and q - phase are equal to : @xmath26~,\\\\ & \\varepsilon_w(t)~=~\\frac{\\pi^2 g_w}{30}t^4+\\frac{g^s_w}{2 \\pi^2 } \\int^{\\infty}_0 dk\\ , k^2 ( k^2+m_w^2)^{1/2}\\exp\\left[{-~\\frac{(k^2+m^2_w)^{1/2}}{t}}\\right]~,\\label{e - w}\\\\ & p_q(t)~=~\\frac{\\pi^2 g_q}{90}t_c^4~+~ \\frac{g^s_q}{2 \\pi^2 } \\int^{\\infty}_0 \\frac{dk~k^4}{3(k^2+m_q^2)^{1/2}}\\exp\\left[{-~\\frac{(k^2+m^2_q)^{1/2}}{t}}\\right]~ -~b~ , \\label{p - q}\\\\ & \\varepsilon_q(t)~=~\\frac{\\pi^2 g_q}{30}t^4~+~ \\frac{g^s_q}{2 \\pi^2 } \\int^{\\infty}_0 dk\\ , k^2 ( k^2+m_q^2)^{1/2}\\exp\\left[{-~\\frac{(k^2+m^2_q)^{1/2}}{t}}\\right ] ~+~b~.\\label{e - q }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the strange particle contribution to thermodynamical functions ( [ p - w]-[e - q ] ) are taken within the boltzmann approximation .",

    "<S> the statistical model of the early stage , smes , describes a transition between confined and deconfined phases of strongly interacting matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the model was formulated in the late 1990s for central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps energies . </S>",
    "<S> it predicted several signals of the transition ( onset of deconfinement ) which were later observed by the na49 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the grand canonical ensemble was used to calculate entropy and strangeness production . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is valid for reactions with mean multiplicities of particles carrying conserved charges being significantly larger than one .    </S>",
    "<S> recent results of na61/shine on hadron production in inelastic p+p interactions suggest that the deconfinement may also take place in these reactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case mean multiplicity of particles with non - zero strange charge is smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> thus for the modelling of p+p interactions the exact strangeness conservation has to be implemented in the smes . </S>",
    "<S> this extension of the smes is presented in the paper . </S>"
