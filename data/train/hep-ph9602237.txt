    "the quantity @xmath49 ( see ( [ 4a ] ) ) is much smaller than 1 for almost all values of @xmath24 , excluding the region of @xmath24 close to @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath51 can be replaced by one and the spectral function ( at @xmath52 ) simplifies to @xmath53 in other words , the positron bunch acts as a particle without inner structure , and the spectral function does not depend on the details of the bunch densities .",
    "it is clear that this function coincides with the spectral function of electron radiation on a point  like particle .",

    "it is interesting to compare the result derived for the energy loss in cbs ( @xmath20 ) with that of the beamstrahlung ( @xmath80 ) . since in the classical limit",
    "the energy loss is determined by the square of the electromagnetic fields , the formula is the same for both cases ( see eq .",
    "( [ deltaclass ] ) ) .",
    "the same argument holds if one studies the classical energy loss as function of the impact parameter @xmath81 between the two colliding bunch axes .",
    "the whole effect is determined by the @xmath82 dependence of @xmath26 which has been described in detail in @xcite , for flat and round bunches .",
    "note that an increase of the energy loss is expected for non head  on collisions .    for beamstrahlung ,",
    "the commonly used quantum parameter @xmath83 is the ratio of the average critical energy for beamstrahlung @xmath84 to the electron energy @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed through the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath10 ( for identical beams ) @xmath85 an approximate expression for the bs energy loss is given in @xcite @xmath86 comparing the loss in the extreme quantum cases we note the different dependence on the incoming electron energy ( @xmath87 ) @xmath88    the parameter @xmath83 is very small for most of the proposed linear colliders .",
    "therefore , the beamstrahlung is mainly classical allowing to transform some known cbs properties of the energy loss to colliders with large @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider , for example , the tesla collider @xcite with flat transverse beams @xmath89 , @xmath90 mm , the design beam energy @xmath91 gev with @xmath92 particles per bunch .",
    "the bs quantum parameter @xmath93 is 0.053 leading to @xmath94 which is about 30 % smaller than the classical energy loss . in this case",
    "the dependence of the energy loss on the vertical beam displacement @xmath95 should be qualitatively the same as that for the @xmath96 collider with approximately the same transverse beam size ratio .",
    "for that collider the number of produced photons and , therefore , the energy loss increases almost two times at @xmath97 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a few years ago an idea has been proposed by chen @xcite to reduce the bs energy loss .",
    "the discussion in @xcite was on a rough qualitative level only . in our terminology",
    "this proposal can be formulated as follows : partitioning a particle bunch into a train of bunchlets , one could change the nature of radiation from bs to cbs .",
    "this may not be a very promising idea since such a proposal leads to a lot of difficulties including an increase of the total bunch length .",
    "if we omit such problems , we are able to discuss this idea quantitatively . in what follows we also neglect , for simplicity , disruption effects .",
    "we notice that beamstrahlung and cbs depend differently on the number of bunchlets @xmath98 . denoting by the index @xmath99 the contribution of an individual bunchlet @xmath99 we see from the above formulae that the ratio @xmath100 depends on the parameter @xmath101 only . neglecting the longitudinal boundary effects",
    ", @xmath102 is the same as the quantum parameter @xmath103 of the whole bunch . on the contrary",
    ", the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath1 of the whole bunch change to @xmath104 as long as the number of bunchlets is such that @xmath105 , one remains in the beamstrahlung regime and practically no energy reduction is obtained .",
    "if @xmath106 is smaller than one , we arrive at the cbs regime assuming that the spacing between two subsequent bunchlets is such that their radiation is incoherent . in that case",
    "the ratio of the energy losses @xmath107 depends on @xmath108 and , therefore , on @xmath98 .",
    "the ratio @xmath109 decreases with increasing @xmath98 ( remind that @xmath110 at @xmath111 ) .",
    "therefore , one can in principle obtain an considerable energy loss reduction for large enough number of bunchlets . to be precise",
    ", the following conditions for a decreasing energy loss should be fulfilled .",
    "first of all , the parameter @xmath112 should be smaller than one , hence , the number of bunchlets @xmath98 should be greater than @xmath10 . additionally , to get a",
    "_ considerable _ reduction one should use such values of the parameter @xmath113 which leads to @xmath114 . as a result , we obtain the requirement    @xmath115    as a side remark we notice , that by choosing a relatively large value of @xmath98 one could reach the situation where the length of a bunchlet @xmath116 can become smaller than its transverse size @xmath117 . in this case",
    "we are still in the validity range of our formulae for cbs ( where we used the restriction @xmath118 only ) , though it may be technically difficult to realize .",
    "let us give a numerical example to show how the discussed reduction works .",
    "we consider the tesla accelerator mentioned above . for this collider",

    "we get an reduction of the energy loss by the factor 2.5 ( notice that in this case @xmath123 ) .",
    "in this section we consider a cross - channel to cbs  the coherent pair production at @xmath5 colliders .",
