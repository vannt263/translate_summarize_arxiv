    "most of the multiparticle production is currently described in terms of color strings stretched between the projectile and target , which decay into new strings and subsequently hadronize to produce observed hadrons .",
    "color strings may be viewed as small areas in the transverse space , @xmath1 , @xmath2=0.2 fm , filled with color field created by the colliding partons .",
    "particles are produced via emission of @xmath3 pairs in this field @xcite .",
    "with growing energy and/or atomic number , the number of strings grows , and they start to overlap , forming clusters , very much similar to disks in the two dimensional percolation theory @xcite . at a certain critical density , @xmath4",
    "a macroscopic cluster appears that marks the percolation phase transition . in ( [ ec1 ] )",
    "@xmath5 is the number of strings and @xmath6 is the total transverse area of the scattering of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the percolation theory governs the geometrical pattern of the string clustering .",
    "its observable implications , however , require introduction of some dynamics to describe string interaction , i.e. , the behavior of a cluster formed by several overlapping strings .",
    "there are several possibilities @xcite . here , we assume that a cluster behaves as a single string with a higher color field @xmath7 corresponding to the vectorial sum of the color charge of each individual @xmath8 string . the resulting color field covers the area @xmath9 of the cluster . as @xmath10 , and",
    "the individual string colors may be oriented in an arbitrary manner respective to one another , the average @xmath11 is zero and @xmath12 .    knowing this charge color @xmath7",
    ", one can compute the particle spectra produced by a single color string of area @xmath9 using the schwinger formula @xcite .",
    "for the multiplicity @xmath13 and the average @xmath14 of particles @xmath15 produced by a cluster of @xmath16 strings one finds @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mean multiplicity and @xmath14 of particles produced by a simple string with area @xmath20 . for strings , just touching each other @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as expected . in the opposite case of maximum overlapping @xmath24 and therefore @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26    equation ( [ ec2 ] ) is the main tool of our calculation @xcite . in order to compute the multiplicities",
    "we generate strings according the monte carlo code of @xcite .",
    "each string is produced at an identified impact parameter . from this , knowing the transverse area of each string , we identify all the clusters formed in each collision and subsequently compute for each of them its multiplicity in units @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 was fixed by normalizing our results to the sps wa98 results for central pb - pb collisions @xcite . in color strings models",
    "both @xmath18 and @xmath27 are assumed to rise with energy due to increase of the rapidity interval available and to the hard contribution .",
    "however this rise is very weak in the range @xmath28=17 - 200 gev and we can neglect it , in the first approximation .",
    "the comparison of our results for the dependence of the multiplicity on the number of participants with the sps wa98 data , the rhic phenix @xcite and phobos @xcite data at @xmath28=130 gev and @xmath28=200 gev , is presented in fig .",

    "b ) comparison of our predictions of ratios of invariant multiplicities of neutral pions for pb - pb collisions of different centralities to minimum bias distributions as a function of @xmath29 and sps wa98 data .",
    "meaning of centrality classes and grey bands can be found en reference @xcite . ]    in order to compute the transverse momentum distribution we make use of the parametrization of the @xmath30 data at 130 gev @xmath31 where @xmath32,@xmath33 and @xmath34 are parameters fitted to data .",
    "the standardly expected distribution for au - au collision is @xmath35 ) we have @xmath36    this implies that the same parametrization ( [ ec3 ] ) can be used for nucleus - nucleus collisions with the only change @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ figure1].b we show the comparison of our results for eight different centrality events in pb - pb collisions with wa98 data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure2].a we show the distribution ( [ ec3 ] ) for charged particles for central ( 5% ) au - au collisions compared to the phenix data @xcite .",
    "also the distribution expected from the independent string picture , eq .",
    "( [ ec4 ] ) , is shown .",
    "a very good agreement is obtained .",
    "we also obtain a good agreement for peripheral collisions , see reference @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure2].b we show our prediction for central au - au collisions at @xmath28=5500 gev compared with the formula ( [ ec4 ] ) . in this case , contrary to rhic energy , a crossing at low @xmath0 is predicted .",
    "distribution using the percolation of strings model ( solid line ) for 5% central au - au and pb - pb collisions at 130 gev / n and 5500 gev / n respectively .",

    "we observe that for a cluster , @xmath38 , which at high density translate into @xmath39 the formula ( [ ec7 ] ) shows an universal relation between multiplicities and @xmath27 .",
    "the scaling laws expressed by the formula ( [ ec3 ] ) with the change ( [ ec6 ] ) and by the formula ( [ ec7 ] ) are very similar to other scaling laws using saturation of gluons .    to conclude , a general comment .",
    "we obtain a good description of the multiplicities and transverse momentum distribution at different energies and different centralities including a low and high @xmath0 suppression .",
    "however we can not reproduce the additional high @xmath0 suppression reported at this conference by several collaborations .",
    "if the explanation is jet quenching , our approach can provide an unified framework to add the phenomenology of jet quenching .",
