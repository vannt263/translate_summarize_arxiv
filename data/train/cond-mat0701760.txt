    "in some condensed matter systems the electron excitation spectrum near the fermi surface can be described by a dirac - type matrix equation . this equation does not arise from relativistic considerations , but rather by linearizing the energy dispersion near ( a finite number of ) dirac points ( intersections of the energy dispersion with the fermi level ) .",
    "such systems can exhibit fermion fractionalization if the dirac equation possesses isolated bound states in the gap between negative - energy ( valence band ) states and positive - energy ( conduction band ) states .",
    "a familiar example is 1-dimensional polyacetylene @xcite . as is generally the case in one dimension , there are two dirac points for polyacetylene",
    ". therefore a 2-component dirac equation governs electron motion near each dirac point .",
    "a distortion of the underlying lattice ( peierls instability ) perturbes the electron motion in a way that couples the two dirac points and opens a gap in the energy spectrum . in the dirac equation description",
    "this is achieved by coupling the dirac field @xmath0 to a scalar field @xmath1 , which is a measure of the lattice distortion .",
    "@xmath1 enjoys a @xmath2 symmetry with two ground states in which it takes homogenous values @xmath3 .",
    "this coupling to @xmath4 leads to a dirac mass @xmath5 . but @xmath1 can also take a position - dependent kink profile ( soliton ) @xmath6 that interpolates between the two vacua @xmath7 . this",
    " twisting \" of the mass parameter describes a defect in the lattice distortion . the dirac equation with the kink profile @xmath6 replacing the homogenous @xmath7 possesses a single mid - gap ( zero - energy ) eigenstate .",
    "this gives rise to fractional fermion number for the electrons : 1/2 per spin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "recently a similar story has been told by c .- y .",

    "the three vectors @xmath8 connect any site from lattice a to its nearest neighbor sites belonging to b. they are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lattice spacing ; see figure 1 .",
    "when no lattice distortion is considered , the tight - binding hamiltonian , with uniform hopping constant @xmath12 , is taken as @xmath13 where the fermion operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 act on sublattices a and b. @xmath16 is diagonal in momentum space.@xmath17",

    "@xmath21 is linearized around the two dirac points , @xmath22 , and is supplemented by a term arising from a ( kekul ) distortion of the lattice , which couples the two fermi points .",

    "in this paper we elaborate the hcm model , and address the following two topics .",
    "hcm leave unspecified the dynamics that gives rise to the complex vortex profile . to remedy this , we first propose identifying the hcm vortex with the nielsen , olesen / landau , ginsburg , abrikosov ( no / lga ) vortex , which is described by a charged scalar field , as in the hcm model .",
    "however an @xmath49 gauge field is also involved in creating a finite - energy no / lga vortex , but no gauge field is present in the hcm model .",
    "therefore , second , we propose introducing a relevant gauge potential and coupling it to the dirac fermions in a chiral manner .",
    "this expands the symmetry of the interaction to the kinetic term , and renders the theory invariant against local , chiral @xmath50 gauge transformations , which also act on the scalar and dirac fields .",
    "additionally there remains a global fermion number @xmath50 symmetry , and its charge is fractionalized .",
    "to present our extension of the hcm model , we shall use dirac matrix notation .",

    "all this ensures finiteness of the vortex energy @xmath92 .",
    "finally , note that our system possesses a global fermion number symmetry , with just the fermi fields transforming with a constant phase : @xmath93 .",
    "consequently the theory possesses a local chiral u(1 ) symmetry and a global u(1 ) fermion number symmetry . because the theory resides in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , no chiral anomalies interfere with our chiral gauge symmetry .    indeed , in spite of the presence of the @xmath56 matrix , the theory is parity ( p ) and charge - conjugation ( c ) invariant and the axial vector current is c - odd .",

    "next we show that the gauge interaction in ( [ rjeq18 ] ) does not affect the zero modes found by hcm without @xmath75 . to this end",

    "this does not affect nomalizability because the zero modes found by hcm are exponentially damped by the interaction with @xmath112 .",
    "finally , since the @xmath47 hcm mode as well as ours has the form , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is an exponentially damped function , we see that indeed @xmath115 is an @xmath97 eigenstate , with eigenvalue @xmath116 .",

    "thus our dirac zero mode , together with the scalar field / gauge field no / lga vortex , is a self consistent solution of the coupled system .",
    "chiral gauge theories have previously entered physics , but in even - dimensional space - time , where the chiral anomaly influences the structure and physical utility of these models @xcite . in the present work",
