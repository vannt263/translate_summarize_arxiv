    "observational evidence indicates that the circumstellar disks of be stars are geometrically thin , optically thick disks , whose outflow velocities are small in comparison to their rotation speeds ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "dynamically this requires that the disk be pressure supported in the vertical direction and centrifugally supported in the radial direction . for this reason the disk structure is most likely to be that of a keplerian hydrostatically supported disk .",
    "how material is injected at keplerian speed into this disk is still unclear , but after it is injected , the gas will spread outward ( and inward if it is injected at intermediate radii ) , owing to viscous effects @xcite .    in a recent paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cb ) described a new non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) monte carlo ( mc ) radiation transfer code that may be applied to study differentially moving three - dimensional circumstellar envelopes .",
    "as an initial application of this code , cb studied the temperature structure of the disks around be stars .",
    "they found the disks to be highly non - isothermal , with a difference of up to 3 times between the minimum and maximum temperatures .",
    "the minimum temperatures are about 30% of the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) and occur at the midplane typically around 35 stellar radii away from the star , depending on the disk density .",
    "the maximum temperatures occur at the base of the star and for very dense disks can be even larger than @xmath2 due to the backwarming of the star .",
    "cb found that the temperature is a hybrid between that of optically thick disks of young stellar objects and optically thin winds from hot stars .",
    "for the optically thin disk s upper layers ( defined as the regions where the distance to the midplane is larger than one scale - height ) , the temperature is nearly isothermal , with an average temperature of about 50% of @xmath3 .",
    "this is much cooler than the 80% value frequently quoted in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the midplane the temperature shows a complicated structure .",
    "it initially drops very quickly close to the stellar photosphere , and the temperature profile is well described by a flat blackbody reprocessing disk @xcite , @xmath4 ^{1/4 } , \\label{als}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the temperature of the radiation that illuminates the disk .",
    "when the disk becomes optically thin vertically , the temperature departs from this curve and rises back to the optically thin radiative equilibrium temperature , which is approximately constant in the winds of hot stars .",
    "the results for the disk temperature raises the question of how it affects the disk structure . determining the self - consistent solution for a keplerian disk is a somewhat complicated problem , because the disk temperature controls its geometry ( via the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ) , which in turn determines the heating and hence the temperature of the disk @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results of an updated version of the code described in cb . in this version of the code",
    "we self - consistently solve both the disk temperature and the fluid equations to obtain the disk density structure .    in section 2",
    "we describe the physical properties of our disk model . in section 3",
    "we briefly describe our mc code .",
    "the properties of the solution for a typical be star disk model are described in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we test our model by fitting continuum observations of @xmath1 scorpii .",
    "a popular model for be star disks is the viscous decretion disk of @xcite .",
    "this model is essentially the same as that employed for protostellar disks , the primary difference being that be disks are outflowing , while pre - main - sequence disks are inflowing . in this model",
    ", it is supposed that some ( as yet unknown ) mechanism(s ) injects material at the keplerian orbital speed into the base of the disk .",
    "eddy / turbulent viscosity then transports angular momentum outward from the inner boundary of the disk ( note that this requires a continual injection of angular momentum into the base of the disk ) .",
    "if the radial density gradient of the disk is steep enough , angular momentum is added to the individual fluid elements and they slowly move outward and form the disk .    to critically test such decretion disk models of be stars against observations , we must determine the structure of the disk , which , as stated in the introduction , is affected by the temperature .    the structure of an isothermal viscous decretion disk was already studied in the literature ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "what governs the vertical structure of the disk is the gas pressure , responsible for the gaussian term in the formula for the disk density ( written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) @xmath9 the disk surface density , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 this expression shows that , for an isothermal disk , the radial structure is controlled by @xmath0 , the viscosity parameter of @xcite and @xmath12 , the disk `` truncation '' radius .",
    "the density scale is controlled primarily by the equatorial mass loss rate @xmath13 , but also by the critical velocity of the star , @xmath14 , and the disk temperature via the sound speed @xmath15 . for large disks ( i.e. , large @xmath12 )",
    ", we have that the surface density of an isothermal disk is a power - law in radius , @xmath16 .",
    "the disk scale - height , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 since the disk is isothermal and the @xmath8 component of the velocity is keplerian ( @xmath19 ) , we find the familiar result that an isothermal disk flares as @xmath20 .",
    "hence , it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : density ] that for an isothermal disk the density falls very sharply with radius as @xmath21 .    to conclude this brief description of the properties of isothermal keplerian viscous disks",
    ", we must describe their velocity structure .",
    "the @xmath8 component is keplerian , as stated above , but those disks must have an outflow velocity .",
    "this velocity is given by the mass conservation relation @xmath22    as mentioned in the introduction , cb found that the disks of classical be stars are highly non - isothermal .",
    "a temperature structure affects the density structure of the disk via the sound speed in eqs .",
    "[ eq : disk_sigma ] and  [ eq : scale_height ] .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the formulae for non - isothermal viscous disks are the same as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : density ] ) to  ( [ eq : radvel ] ) , with the temperature replaced by the weighted average of @xmath23 in the vertical direction ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) @xmath24",
    "for the results shown in sections 4 and 5 we employ an updated version of the code of cb .",
    "the basic steps of the code are as follows :    1 .",
    "the code starts with a constant temperature for the disk , an initial guess for the hydrogen level populations and the isothermal viscous decretion density [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : density ] ) to  ( [ eq : radvel ] ) ] ; 2 .",
    "a full nlte mc radiation transfer , using the sobolev approximation for the line opacities , is performed .",
    "3 .   the heating , ionization and excitation rates sampled during step 2 are used to solve the rate equations and the energy conservation equation , to obtain news values for the disk temperature and hydrogen level populations .",
    "the new disk temperature is used for calculating the new density structure .",
    "steps 2  4 are repeated until all the state variables and the disk temperature have converged to a solution . 6 .",
    "if wanted , a post - processing code is run to calculate observables ( sed , line profiles , images , etc . ) using the results of step 5 .",
    "ccccccc @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath0 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 + @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & 0.1 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 +    [ tab : disk_model ]    in table  [ tab : disk_model ] we list the parameters of the disk model we choose as an example to illustrate the properties of our solution for the disk structure .",
    "the model is similar to the ones used by cb and consists of a b3iv star surrounded by a steady state disk , sustained by an equatorial mass loss rate of @xmath37 .",
    "we also carried out calculations for other spectral types and mass loss rates .",
    "the details of the solution varies with the choice of parameters , but the general properties of the disk structure are similar .",
    "cb studied the temperature properties of disks with a known density function , corresponding to the isothermal viscous disk of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : density ] ) to ( [ eq : radvel ] ) . the temperature structure of our self - consistent keplerian disk is shown in figures  [ fig : temp ] and  [ fig : temp2 ] .",
    "interestingly , the temperature structure is nearly identical to the results of cb ( see , for instance , their figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the disk is isothermal in the upper layers and also in the vertically optically thin portions of the midplane ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the inner disk ( @xmath39 ) behaves initially as a flat reprocessing disk [ eq .",
    "( [ als ] ) , thin line of figure  [ fig : temp2]-a ] and departs form this curve when it starts to become optically thin vertically , which happens for @xmath40 ( see cb for further details ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : angle ] we analyze the properties of our solution for the disk density to understand how our self - consistent solution differs from the isothermal solution . in the left panel",
    "we show the disk opening angle vs. radius , defined as @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : opangle}\\ ] ] for reference , we also show the opening angle corresponding to disk scale - heights given by @xmath42 .",
    "a @xmath43 of 1 corresponds to a non - flared disk ( wedge - shaped ) and a @xmath43 of 1.5 to an isothermal disk .",
    "the opening angle for the inner disk ( @xmath44 ) is very small , in agreement with the general belief that the disks of be stars are geometrically very thin .",
    "however , the behavior of the opening angle is rather peculiar ; we observe a _ decrease _ of the opening angle ( de - flaring ) between 1 and 2 stellar radii .",
    "this de - flaring is a consequence of the very sharp fall of the temperature ( see figure  [ fig : temp2 ] ) .",
    "the disk flares significantly only for @xmath45 , where it becomes isothermal .",
    "the radial structure of the disk density is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : angle ] .",
    "we also show for comparison the @xmath21 curve corresponding to the isothermal solution for the density .",
    "we see that the slope of the mc density profile for the inner disk departs significantly from the -3.5 value ; it is much shallower close to the star and much steeper for @xmath46 .",
    "this is , again , a result of the temperature structure in the midplane . from the observational point of view",
    "this is an interesting result , because the slope of the density profile can , in principe , be mapped via a detailed study of the ir excess @xcite .",

    "this star has been a standard of spectral classification ( b0 iv ) since long ago , but in the summer of 2000 it started to show signs of circumstellar activity that have lasted to present day .",
    "the object is a non - eclipsing binary system with a @xmath611.5 mag optically fainter secondary companion with an orbital period of 10.6 years @xcite and a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath62=0.94 , * ? ? ?",
    "we use in our modeling data corresponding to the sed before and after the be phase .",
    "we also model the continuum polarization between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the parameters of the primary companion were extracted from @xcite and are summarized in table  [ tab : dsco ] .",
    "we assume that the disk around the primary companion is in the orbital plane of the binary system , so the disk inclination angle is the same as the orbital inclination angle @xmath65 .",

    "the parameters of our best - fitting model are listed in table  [ tab : dsco2 ] .",

    "there are some shortcomings in our modeling that we do not discuss here , given the limited scope of this paper .",
