    "recently hoava proposed a power - counting renormalizable theory with consistent ultra - violet ( uv ) behavior @xcite .",
    "although presenting an infrared ( ir ) fixed point , namely general relativity , in the uv the theory exhibits an anisotropic , lifshitz scaling between time and space .",
    "due to these novel features , there has been a large amount of effort in examining and extending the properties of the theory itself @xcite .",
    "additionally , application of hoava - lifshitz gravity as a cosmological framework gives rise to hoava - lifshitz cosmology , which proves to lead to interesting behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can examine specific solution subclasses @xcite , the phase - space behavior @xcite , the gravitational wave production @xcite , the perturbation spectrum @xcite , the matter bounce @xcite , the black hole properties @xcite , the dark energy phenomenology @xcite , the observational constraints on the parameters of the theory @xcite , the astrophysical phenomenology @xcite , the thermodynamic properties @xcite etc .",
    "however , despite this extended research , there are still many ambiguities if hoava - lifshitz gravity is reliable and capable of a successful description of the gravitational background of our world , as well as of the cosmological behavior of the universe @xcite .",
    "although the foundations and the possible conceptual and phenomenological problems of hoava - lifshitz gravity and its associated cosmology are still an open issue , it is worth investigating different cosmological scenarios in this gravitational background . in this regard , it would be interesting to examine cosmological scenarios where apart from the gravitational sector there exists a generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is an alternative to the quintessence model which had attracted great interest in recent times .",
    "the scenario can explain the acceleration of the universe via an exotic equation of state , which mimics a pressureless fluid at the early stages of evolution of the universe , and a cosmological constant at late times .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the gcg scenario as a unified description for dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "the background evolution fits well the observational data @xcite , however the cosmological behavior is indistinguishable from that of the @xmath0cdm scenario while fitting with the structure formation data as well as with data from cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite",
    ". additionally , the scenario is plagued by the presence of instabilities as well as oscillations which are not observed in the matter power spectrum .",
    "although this is a serious drawback of gcg scenario it is not the final verdict for its fate as a model for the unified description of dark matter and dark energy . as it was shown by reis _",
    "_ in @xcite , allowing for small entropy perturbations can eliminate instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum , even in the linear regime , for a region of the parameter space where the gcg model behaves quite differently from the @xmath0cdm one . furthermore , as it was shown by avelino _",
    "_ in @xcite , in the gcg scenario the transition from dark matter to dark energy behavior is never smooth , and hence the linear theory which was used by @xcite to rule out gcg as a unified model , may break down late in the matter - dominated era , even on large cosmological scales . therefore , nonlinear effects should be necessarily taken into account when confronting cosmological observations .",
    "moreover , the addition of baryons in the gcg scenario can also improve the behavior of the matter power spectrum @xcite . in summary , the gcg as a unified model of dark matter and dark energy is not completely ruled out and it deserves further investigations .",
    "finally , we mention that gcg in the presence of cold dark matter as well as baryonic matter ( where gcg acts as a normal dark energy candidate ) is one of the most well - fit scenarios with cosmological observations , amongst all the exotic models that have been considered so far @xcite .    in the present work we construct the cosmology of a generalized chaplygin gas in a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "additionally , we use observational data from type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , together with the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) conditions , to constrain the various parameters of the model .",
    "furthermore , in order to be general we perform the analysis both with and without the detailed - balance condition of the gravitational sector .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present hoava - lifshitz cosmology in both its detailed - balance and beyond - detailed - balance version . in section [ gcghl ]",
    "we construct the scenario of a generalized chaplygin gas in hoava - lifshitz gravitational background and we extract the cosmological equations",
    ". in section [ observations ] we use observational data in order to constrain the various parameters of the scenario . in section [ cosmimpl ]",
    "we discuss the cosmological implications , focusing on the evolution of the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe and of the expansion rate .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the summary of our results .",
    "in this section we briefly review the scenario where the cosmological evolution is governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables are the lapse and shift functions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , and the spatial metric @xmath3 ( roman letters indicate spatial indices ) . in terms of these fields the full metric",
    "is written as : @xmath4 where indices are raised and lowered using @xmath3 .",
    "the scaling transformation of the coordinates reads : @xmath5 .",
    "the gravitational action is decomposed into a kinetic and a potential part as @xmath6 .",
    "the assumption of detailed balance @xcite reduces the possible terms in the lagrangian , and it allows for a quantum inheritance principle @xcite , since the @xmath7-dimensional theory acquires the renormalization properties of the @xmath8-dimensional one . under the detailed balance condition the full action of hoava - lifshitz gravity is given by @xmath9 \\right\\ } , \\label{acct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath11 the cotton tensor , and the covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the spatial metric @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath12 is the totally antisymmetric unit tensor , @xmath13 is a dimensionless constant and the variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants with mass dimensions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "finally , we mention that in action ( [ acct ] ) we have already performed the usual analytic continuation of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 of the original version of hoava - lifshitz gravity , since such a procedure is required in order to obtain a realistic cosmology @xcite ( although it could fatally affect the gravitational theory itself ) .",
    "therefore , in the present work @xmath20 is a positive constant , which as usual is related to the cosmological constant in the ir limit .    in order to add the matter component we follow the hydrodynamical approach ( which is most suitable for phenomenological analysis ) of adding a cosmological stress - energy tensor to the gravitational field equations , by demanding to recover the usual general relativity formulation in the low - energy limit @xcite .",
    "thus , this matter - tensor is a hydrodynamical approximation with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or @xmath21 and @xmath23 ) as parameters .",
    "note that this @xmath21 is the total matter energy density , that is it accounts for both the baryonic @xmath24 as well as the dark matter @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , one can additionally include the standard - model - radiation component ( corresponding to photons and neutrinos ) , with the additional parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( or @xmath26 and @xmath28 ) .    in order to investigate cosmological frameworks",
    ", we impose the projectability condition @xcite and we use an frw metric @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 corresponding to open , flat , and closed universe respectively ( we have adopted the convention of taking the scale factor @xmath32 to be dimensionless and the curvature constant @xmath33 to have mass dimension 2 ) . by varying @xmath1 and @xmath3 , we extract the friedmann equations : @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{8(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\kappa^4\\mu^2\\lambda   k}{16(3\\lambda-1)^2a^2}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath37 is the usual `` dark radiation term '' , present in hoava - lifshitz cosmology @xcite , while the constant term is just the explicit cosmological constant .",
    "finally , as usual , @xmath21 follows the standard evolution equation @xmath38 while @xmath26 ( standard - model radiation ) follows @xmath39    if we require expressions ( [ fr1fluid ] ) to coincide with the standard friedmann equations , in units where @xmath40 we set @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the `` cosmological '' newton s constant , that is the one that is read from the friedmann equations .",
    "we mention that in theories with lorentz invariance breaking @xmath43 does not coincide with the `` gravitational '' newton s constant @xmath44 , that is the one that is read from the action , unless lorentz invariance is restored @xcite . for completeness",
    "we mention that in our case @xmath45 as it can be straightforwardly read from the action ( [ acct ] ) ( our definitions of @xmath42 , @xmath44 coincide with those of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it becomes obvious that in the ir ( @xmath46 ) , where lorentz invariance is restored , @xmath42 and @xmath44 coincide .    in our work",
    "the running of @xmath13 is not a problem , since the whole relevant cosmological history , that is after inflation , is obviously inside the ir limit , that is with @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergence of @xmath13 from @xmath19 , that is the quantum gravitational features of the theory , become significant at very early times , that is close to the big bang or the cosmological bounce .",
    "this was additionally shown in @xcite , where a detailed analysis based on snia , bao and cmb observations , as well as bbn considerations , constrained @xmath13 inside a narrow window around its infrared value : @xmath47 . in summary , since in this work we are interested in post - inflation evolution , we set @xmath46 , and thus we simplify our notation using @xmath48 for the ( coincided gravitational and cosmological ) newton s constant .",
    "the aforementioned formulation of hoava - lifshitz cosmology has been performed under the imposition of the detailed - balance condition .",
    "however , in the literature there is a discussion whether this condition leads to reliable results or if it is able to reveal the full information of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to investigate also the friedman equations in the case where detailed balance is relaxed . in such a case one",
    "can in general write @xcite : @xmath49\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{\\sigma_2}{3(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac { k}{a^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\&+ &   \\frac{\\sigma_2}{6(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\frac { k}{a^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and the constants @xmath52 are arbitrary ( with @xmath53 being negative and @xmath54 positive ) . as we observe , the effect of the detailed - balance relaxation is the decoupling of the coefficients , together with the appearance of a term proportional to @xmath55 .    finally ,",
    "if we force ( [ fr1c]),([fr2c ] ) to coincide with the standard friedmann equations , we obtain : @xmath56 while in this case the `` gravitational '' newton s constant @xmath57 reads @xcite : @xmath58 similarly to the detailed balance case , in the ir ( @xmath46 ) @xmath42 and @xmath44 coincide , and thus in the following we will use @xmath48 to denote the ( coincided gravitational and cosmological ) newton s constant .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , chaplygin gas scenarios have been studied extensively as possible candidates for a unified description of dark matter and dark energy through a single fluid .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas is a fluid with an equation of state given by : @xmath59 with @xmath60 a positive constant and @xmath61 . @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the energy density and pressure of the chaplygin gas , and henceforth a subscript `` c '' will denote quantities pertaining to the chaplygin gas .",
    "the simple chaplygin gas is the special case of @xmath64 .",
    "finally , considering the covariant conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath62 satisfies the standard evolution equation @xmath65    equations ( [ rhochaplygin ] ) and ( [ rhodotfluid ] ) can be easily solved to yield @xcite : @xmath66}^{\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 denotes the present - day density of the chaplygin gas ( in what follows , a subscript 0 will always denote the present - day value of a quantity ) , and we have introduced the parameter @xmath68 thus , ( [ rhochaplygin ] ) provides the pressure of the chaplygin gas as @xmath69}^{-\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath70 is therefore just the present value of the equation - of - state parameter of the generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 is related to the sound velocity of the chaplygin gas at the present time , which is given by @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the most important advantage of the chaplygin gas scenario is that it behaves like dark matter at early times ( @xmath73 ) and as a cosmological constant at late times ( @xmath74 ) , smoothly interpolating between the two phases .",
    "thus , since in this work we are interested in investigating the generalized chaplygin gas in hoava - lifshitz cosmology , we first separate the total matter energy density @xmath21 , that was present in the friedmann equations of the previous section , into the baryonic @xmath24 and the dark matter @xmath25 parts , and then we use the generalized chaplygin gas energy density @xmath62 instead of @xmath25 . therefore , using also the definitions ( [ simpleconstants0 ] ) , the friedmann equations , of the detailed balance case take the form : @xmath75+\\left [ \\frac{k^2}{2\\lambda a^4}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2 } \\right]-\\frac{k}{a^2}\\ ] ] @xmath76-\\left[\\frac{k^2}{4\\lambda a^4}-\\frac{3\\lambda}{4}\\right]-\\frac{k}{2a^2}.\\ ] ] similarly , for the beyond - detailed - balance case the friedmann equations ( [ fr1c]),([fr2c ] ) , using also the identifications ( [ simpleconstants0nd ] ) , become @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{2}{(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left [ \\frac{\\sigma_1}{6}+\\frac{\\sigma_3 k^2}{6a^4 } + \\frac{\\sigma_4 k}{6a^6 }   \\right]-\\frac{k}{a^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ -\\frac{3}{(3{\\lambda}-1)}\\left [ -\\frac{\\sigma_1}{6}+\\frac{\\sigma_3 k^2}{18a^4 } + \\frac{\\sigma_4 k}{6a^6 }   \\right]-\\frac{k}{2a^2}.\\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in the conventional gravitational background of general relativity , the cosmological scenarios of generalized chaplygin gas have been extensively constrained using observational data",
    ". in particular , in @xcite snia observations were used , in @xcite data from large scale structure , in @xcite cmb data , while in @xcite the authors used gravitational lensing observations .",
    "finally , constraints from combined data sources have been obtained in @xcite and @xcite .    in the present work we will consider observations in order to constraint the scenario of a generalized chaplygin gas in a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity . in particular we will use data from snia , bao , cmb and bbn to constrain the chaplygin gas parameters together with the parameters of hoava - lifshitz gravity . for completeness",

    "in particular , at high redshifts the radiation ( standard - model and dark one ) dominates and drives the expansion , while the chaplygin gas is subdominant .",
    "however @xmath90 , which quantifies the hoava - lifshitz dark radiation and kination - like components , can have a significant impact on the expansion rate at arbitrarily high redshifts .",
    "in this work we investigated the cosmological scenario of generalized chaplygin gas in a universe governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity , both in the detailed - balance as well as in the beyond - detailed balance version of the theory . furthermore , in order to obtain a realistic cosmology we have included the baryonic matter and standard - model radiation sectors .",
    "after extracting the cosmological equations , we used data from snia , bao and cmb observations , as well as arguments from big bang nucleosynthesis , in order to impose constraints on the various parameters of the scenario . for the detailed - balance case",
    "we have three free parameters , namely the exponent @xmath71 of the generalized chaplygin gas , its present equation - of - state parameter value @xmath96 , and the effective neutrino parameter @xmath97 which quantifies the total amount of hoava - lifshitz dark - radiation and kination - like components allowed during bbn .",

    "the free parameters are five , namely @xmath71 , @xmath96 , @xmath99 , the curvature density @xmath93 , and the parameter @xmath95 , which is the ratio of the dark - radiation energy density to the sum of dark - radiation and kination - like energy densities at the time of bbn .",

    "additionally , in figures [ cont_varying_alpha]-[cont_varying_beta ] we presented the likelihood contours of the model parameters . from this analysis we deduced that the entire ( consistently with bbn ) range of @xmath100 is allowed , for suitable choices of the other parameters .",
    "we also found tight constraints on the curvature and on @xmath70 .",
    "after the observational elaboration , we investigated the cosmological implications of the examined scenarios .",
    "in particular , we focused on the evolution of the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe , and of the expansion rate . in the detailed - balance case , we saw that in general at very early - times is radiation that dominates , at intermediate redshifts is the chaplygin gas that dominates , behaving like matter for a long time , and finally at late times the dominant chaplygin gas behaves like dark energy , triggering the accelerating expansion ( see fig [ db_w_bf ] ) .",
    "this evolution is consistent with the thermal history of the universe , and this is an advantage of the present scenario .",
    "note moreover that the present accelerated era is described in a unified way , without the need of any additional mechanism .",
    "concerning the qualitative dependence on the various parameters , we found that the expansion rate has a strong dependence on both @xmath96 and @xmath99 at low redshifts , while at high redshifts , where the chaplygin gas is not dominant , this dependence weakens and disappears ( see fig [ db_variations ] ) .",
    "lastly , the dependence on @xmath71 is very weak at all redshifts .    in the beyond - detailed - balance scenario we found a similar behavior for the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe , that is we obtained successively a radiation , a matter , and a dark energy era ( see fig [ w_bf ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath96 has a weak impact on the expansion rate at lower redshifts , @xmath99 has a significant effect at large redshifts , while @xmath93 and especially @xmath95 and @xmath71 have a negligible impact on the expansion rate at all redshifts ( see figures [ h_varying_as]-[h_varying_beta ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas in hoava - lifshitz gravitational background is compatible with observations , and can successfully reproduce the expansion history of the universe . however , we should mention that the present analysis does not enlighten the discussion about the possible conceptual problems and instabilities of hoava - lifshitz gravity , nor it can address the questions concerning the validity of its theoretical background , which is the subject of interest of other studies .",
    "it just analyzes the phenomenological consequences and the cosmological implications of the generalized chaplygin gas in such a gravitational background , and thus its results can be taken into account only if hoava - lifshitz gravity passes successfully the necessary theoretical tests .    in the same lines ,",
    "the present work does not address the problem of undesirable instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectra , that gcg scenario faces in standard einstein gravity .",
    "although , as discussed in the introduction , there are several approaches which try to solve this problem in conventional gravity , it may be quite interesting to see whether it can be addressed in the context of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "let us make some comments in this perspective .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , gcg can be modelled in terms of scalar fields having both canonical as well as non - canonical kinetic energy terms , and thus perturbing the gcg one has to essentially perturb these scalar fields . in the case of hoava - lifshitz gravity one",
    "expects in general the linear perturbations to be quite different due to higher - order curvature - terms present in the action .",
    "these higher - order gradient terms can in principle generate non - adiabatic pressure perturbation , which can help to cure the instabilities or oscillations in the power spectra even in the large scales",
    ". the effect can be prominent with scalar fields having non - canonical kinetic energy terms , for instance of dirac - born - infeld form , which is typical for gcg - like equation of state .    in conclusion ,",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas scenario in hoava - lifshitz cosmology , can have rich cosmological consequences .",
    "the present study is a first step in this direction , where we have considered the background evolution and have confronted the model with a variety of currently available observational data .",
    "the next step is to consider the inhomogeneous gcg model in hoava - lifshitz gravity , which will be our goal in the near future .",
