    "the collision between two ground state atoms at low ( @xmath0k ) temperature poses challenging computational problems which can be summarized by the words  long range  and  coupled channels  .",
    "the former problem arises from the fact that in the collision process the atomic clouds  polarize  each other , leading to long ranged dispersion potentials @xcite .",
    "the latter problem arises from the fact that the internal hyperfine structure of the atoms leads to a set of coupled schrdinger equations that describe the transitions which an atom in the incident channel can make to many of these hyperfine states .",
    "accurate calculations of the scattering properties and wave functions of the atom - atom collision are crucial , since the macroscopic shape of the bose - einstein condensate as well as the lineshapes of the photoassociation spectra @xcite depend sensitively on these quantities .    the lower the incident energy of the atoms , the larger are the distances for which the potentials affect the phase shifts .",
    "this can be seen from the wkb approximation to the phase shift which contains integrals over the local wave length @xmath1 ^{1/2}$ ] of the form @xmath2 since the first significant term in the expansion above contains the ratio of the potential to the asymptotic wave number .",
    "further , when negative energy channels are coupled to the positive energy incident channel , it can become difficult to enforce the appropriate decaying wave function boundary condition , with resulting loss of stability , depending on the algorithm used .",
    "there are various calculational methods available for dealing with this scattering problem : modified numerov , gordon s @xcite@xcite , a finite element method ( fem ) @xcite , and a recently developed method that consist of replacing the coupled differential equations by equivalent integral equations ( iem ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are more sophisticated finite difference methods @xcite ; we , however , will not consider these methods here since they are not as widely in use .",
    "methods involving the representation of a continuous function by a finite set of sampling points have been discussed @xcite .",
    "one such method led to the mapped fourier grid method @xcite , which has been employed for the calculation of the collision between cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the interaction of cold atoms with surfaces has also been discussed @xcite , including how to implement boundary conditions ..    depending on the degree of accuracy required and the ease of performing the calculation , any one of these methods may be the most suitable for a particular situation .",
    "it is nevertheless of interest to compare these methods with each other as far as accuracy , stability and numerical complexity are concerned .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to compare the three methods , by numerically evaluating a benchmark test case described below .    ",
    "numerical computational stability  is a many - faceted concept .",
    "it manifests itself through the degree of accuracy obtained .",
    "there are at least three ingredients :    * \\i ) how the numerical truncation error of the algorithm is offset by the presence of the accumulation of round - off errors .",
    "the larger the number of mesh points the smaller the truncation error , but the larger is the corresponding overall round - off error .",
    "different algorithms strike a different balance between these two errors . *",
    "ii )  the sensitivity of the final result to the errors in the input data , such as the potentials , masses , etc . this sensitivity is expresses by the  condition  of the formulation model . *",
    "\\iii ) how the asymptotic boundary conditions are achieved , both in the open and the closed channels . for the latter ,",
    "the growing solutions that contaminate the decaying solutions have to be eliminated .",
    "each algorithm proceeds by a different method .",
    "for example , in the iem we introduce scaling factors in each partition that prevent the unwanted solution . in the finite difference methods ,",
    "one has to integrate inward and outward and then match at some intermediary distance . here",
    "the matching matrix can introduce errors . with the finite elements ,",
    "the closed channel solutions are forced to be zero at the final matching point , automatically eliminating the unwanted growing solutions .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to investigate in detail the stability properties of the three algorithms described in the present study .",
    "for that , a detailed comparison of the numerical solution with an exact solution for an artificial test case would have to be performed .",
    "rather , we here attempt to obtain some numerical evidence for the degree of stability of the three methods for a realistic example .",
    "the test case we have chosen consists of a model calculation that captures the essence of the collision of two ultra - cold @xmath3s alkali atoms .",
    "the characteristic feature of such collisions is that in going from large to small internuclear separations a change of coupling schemes occurs .",
    "asymptotically , the hyperfine structure of the individual alkali atoms dominates , while at short internuclear separations the molecular @xmath4 and @xmath5 potentials dominate .",
    "a basic understanding of the properties of these two born - oppenheimer potential curves can be found in any text book on quantum mechanics that discusses the electronic structure of a @xmath6 molecule .",
    "here it is sufficient to realize that they have an identical long - range attractive van der waals behavior and are split exponentially via an exchange mechanism at shorter internuclear separations .    the simplest multi - channel potential that captures this physics is thus a two channel model . taking into account that for small collision energies the nuclear rotation can be safely ignored , the hamiltonian is conveniently parametrized as @xmath7 where the reduced mass @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the asymptotic splitting between the two channels , and @xmath10 is the total energy in the system .",
    "the @xmath11-dependent potentials of our test problem are the lennard - jones potential @xmath12 and an off - diagonal exchange coupling given by @xmath13 . the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the wavefunction for the open and closed channel , respectively .",
    "notice that the zero of energy is located at the lowest of the two asymptotes .",
    "obviously this hamiltonian is set up in terms of the atomic basis . at large internuclear separation",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to a diagonal matrix .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian would be diagonal for all internuclear separation if the exponential off - diagonal potential were absent .",
    "it turns out that for internuclear separations where this term is large compared to @xmath9 it is informative to calculate the adiabatic potentials by diagonalizing the potential term of the hamiltonian at each internuclear separation . at shorter distances",
    "the resulting potentials correspond to a very deep x@xmath16 and a shallow @xmath17 potential , to a good approximation .    for two colliding ultra - cold @xmath3s na atoms , realistic values of the constants",
    "are @xmath18 amu , @xmath19=1472 @xmath20@xcite , @xmath21=@xmath22 @xmath23.@xmath24 , a=2.9 @xmath25 , b=0.81173 @xmath26 , and @xmath9= 0.2693@xmath27 a.u .",
    "this choice of @xmath9 is approximately equal to the atomic hyperfine splitting of the @xmath28 na atom .",
    "the total energy @xmath29 corresponds to a temperature of @xmath30 @xmath0k .",
    "since @xmath31 , the energy in the second channel is negative , i.e. , only one of the two channels is asymptotically accessible . in the above @xmath25 stands for atomic units , and",
    "@xmath32 is the bohr radius .",
    "the conversion into entirely @xmath26 units is achieved by dividing the above equation by @xmath33 one obtains @xmath34 where @xmath11 is in units of @xmath26 and the potential and energy matrices , @xmath35and @xmath10 respectively , are in units of @xmath36 the conversion of a quantity in @xmath23 .",
    "units to @xmath37 units is achieved by multiplying the former by @xmath38 the potential matrix is @xmath39 , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the energy matrix is @xmath42 .\\ ] ] here @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the wave numbers in each channel , are given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 in our numerical example , the corresponding values are @xmath47  and @xmath48 the wave function is normalized so that asymptotically it becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two elements related to the real scattering @xmath52 matrix , in terms of which the phase shifts can be obtained .    in this model , the diagonal potential extends to considerably larger distances than the coupling potential .",
    "further , between 6 and 10 @xmath26 the diagonal potential is very deep leading to many oscillations in the wave functions .",
    "for example , near @xmath53 the local wave length @xmath54 in both channels is @xmath55 near @xmath56 @xmath57 with smaller ripples superimposed , and near @xmath58 the local wave length has increased to @xmath59 at distances less than @xmath60 the repulsive portion of the potential becomes very large making the wave function very small . in order to allow for the singularity of the diagonal potentials near the origin",
    ", a parameter @xmath61 is defined , and the wave functions are set to zero in the interval @xmath62.$ ] a value of @xmath63 is found to be satisfactory . in addition , the calculation is carried out to a maximum radius , @xmath64 , beyond which all potentials are set equal to zero . in our calculations , @xmath64 is set equal to @xmath65 when @xmath64 is increased further , the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 still change beyond the 6 th .",
    "significant figure , as can be seen from the table in appendix , even though the lennard - jones potential is less than @xmath66 .",
    "the large effect on the phase - shift produced by such a small potential is due to the occurrence of the factor @xmath67 in the integrals involving the potential tail , as was already pointed out in the introduction . rather than numerically calculating such changes ,",
    "it is preferable to employ perturbation methods , which are described in appendix 2 .      in this method the differential equation @xmath68",
    "is transformed into the lippmann - schwinger integral equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a undisorted wave function , like @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the undistorted green s function matrix @xcite .",
    "a motivation for such an approach is that the solutions of integral equations have better numerical stability than the solutions of differential equations .",
    "one common objection to the use of integral equations has been that the solution leads to large matrices which are not sparse and hence require substantially larger amounts of computing time than the sparse matrices of differential equations .",
    "this objection was overcome in our integral equation method ( iem ) by dividing the whole radial interval into partitions .",
    "the integral equations in each partition lead to dense matrices of small dimension , but the matrix that combines the local solutions into the global one , albeit of large dimension , is sparse . it should be noted that this latter property is valid only in configuration space , because only in this space do the green s functions have the required semi - separable nature . in the present version of the iem method the ( variable ) size of each of the partitions is determined in terms of two parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 as follows . in each radial region a local wave length in channels 1 and 2 is obtained as @xmath75 and @xmath76 the smaller of the two local wavelengths is taken , and the size of the partition in that region is determined such that there are a given total number @xmath73 of chebyshev points per local wave length . allowing for the fact that in each partition there are 16 chebyshev points , the average length of a partition for a given local wave length @xmath54 is @xmath77 the length of each partition is subsequently readjusted using the tolerance parameter @xmath78 as follows . according to the iem method @xcite , in each partition two sets of  local  functions are calculated in terms of which the global function @xmath79 is obtained as a linear combination .",
    "the accuracy of each of the local functions can be determined by the size of the coefficients of the highest order chebyshev polynomials . if the relative accuracy of the local functions in a given partition is larger than @xmath80 then that partition is divided in half , and the testing is continued .",
    "if the initially chosen value of @xmath73 is too small , then the initial partitions are too large , and many of the partitions are subsequently reduced by the @xmath74 criterion . in this case the final number of partitions @xmath81 becomes larger than their initial value . if the chosen value of @xmath73 is too large , then most of the partitions are unnecessarily small , and the value of @xmath81 is too large , leading to a larger accumulation of roundoff errors for the final elements of the @xmath82-matrix .",
    "an exception is the interval @xmath62.$ ] this interval is considered as one partition , containing a total of @xmath83 chebyshev points .",
    "this is sufficient since the wave function is very small in this region ( less than the desired accuracy for the values of @xmath82 ) , and the values of @xmath82 were found to be stable to 11 significant figures as @xmath84 was varied below @xmath85 .    in summary , for a given value of @xmath80",
    "the value of @xmath73 was varied until the smallest number of partitions @xmath81 was obtained .",
    "an example is given in the table below .",
    "values of @xmath50 and number of partitions @xmath81 as a + function of nl for the tolerance @xmath86    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a comparison between the three methods is displayed in table 7 , which lists the number of mesh points required to achieve a certain accuracy for @xmath87    table 7 .",
    "comparison between three methods .",
    "@xmath88k_1@xmath89    the finite element ( fem ) and the integral equation ( iem ) methods are nearly identical in performance . both",
    "can easily adjust the size of the partitions to the local conditions of the potentials ; both give stability of at least nine significant figures , and both use approximately the same number of mesh points .",
    "their numerical complexity is also comparable since a cpu - time test shows that both use approximately the same computer time for the case tested here .",
    "the iem  and the fem differ in the 8th significant figure ( by @xmath90 for @xmath91 the reason for this difference is not known , but could be related to the fact that both the fem and the gordon methods have not yet fully converged as the number of partitions is increased , as can be seen from tables 5 and 6 , and in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "these figures show the value of @xmath92 from the fifth significant figure onward , as a function of the total number of mesh points for each of the three methods in progressively larger detail . the somewhat slower convergence for the fem may be due to the fact that the algorithm for determining the partition size , especially in the vicinity of a turning point , is not as refined for the fem as for the iem .",
    "the gordon method is simpler to implement than the two other ones and gives a respectable accuracy of seven significant figures , albeit at the expense of a much larger number of mesh points , which in turn leads to a larger accumulation of roundoff errors .",
    "an improved numerov method gave only four significant figures ( @xmath50= -0.31233(2 ) ) and is not mentioned further . in the iem ,",
    "the boundary conditions are built in automatically via the green s functions , while in the present form of the fem the solutions with exponential growth are eliminated by forcing the closed channel component to be zero on the surface @xmath93 in a separate study of two coupled equations @xcite , it is shown that there are situations in which the conventional numerov method has severe difficulty in obtaining the correct asymptotic boundary condition , while both the iem and the fem do not .",
    "it should be clear that the accuracy achieved in this benchmark calculation is not directly relevant for physical applications , since the potentials are usually known only to low accuracy .",
    "instead , the accuracy achieved is to be construed as a measure of the stability of the method , which gives an indication of how well the method is expected to perform under more complex situations , such as when many channels are involved , or when the range of the interaction is excessively large , or at very high energies where many oscillations in the wave functions are present .    in conclusion , all three methods performed well in providing a numerical solution to the coupled channel test case examined here .",
    "this case could serve as a benchmark calculation for testing additional methods , since the effective range and the scattering length are also calculated .",
    "further comparison of various methods under more complex conditions would be desirable in order to determine the conditions under which a particular one of the methods would be preferable .",
    "acknowledgments :  e.t . would like to acknowledge useful discussions with dr .",
    "fred mies , who has implemented the original version of the gordon method used by the authors .",
    "as the value of @xmath64 ( this is the truncation radius beyond which all potentials are set to zero ) is increased , the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) change slightly because of the non - zero value of the potential at large distances . in order to extrapolate the @xmath82 values to @xmath94",
    "it is preferable to include the long - range tail of the potential perturbatively rather than numerically .",
    "showing how this can be done is the purpose of this appendix .",
    "it is of course also possible to include the long range tails numerically , as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite the variation of the @xmath82 s with large distances , as given in table 3 , can be reproduced numerically by means of perturbation theory , as will now be shown .    for this section",
    "we assume that the radial distance is sufficiently large so that the coupling potential between the two channels is negligible .",
    "thus , only the effect of the diagonal potential in each channel @xmath95 on @xmath96 needs to be considered",
    ". we also continue to assume that the angular momentum number @xmath97 is zero .",
    "both assumptions can removed by a generalization of the present discussion .",
    "we will denote two consecutive values of @xmath64 by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , and assume that the numerical calculation extends out to @xmath100 we denote by @xmath101 the diagonal potential for @xmath102 and set @xmath103 for @xmath104 the corresponding wave function is denoted by @xmath105 which is equal to the wave function @xmath14 known numerically . because @xmath106 for @xmath107 @xmath108 similarly , @xmath109 is equal to the diagonal potential for @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 the corresponding wave function , to be calculated perturbatively , is denoted by @xmath113 it obeys the equation @xmath114 , which can be written @xmath115 where @xmath116 thus , @xmath117 is the perturbative potential which vanishes outside of the interval @xmath118.$ ] using for the inverse of the operator @xmath119 the green s function integral expression in terms of @xmath120 one obtains the most general form for @xmath121 @xmath122    where @xmath123 and @xmath124 the coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 are obtained by matching @xmath127 to @xmath128 at @xmath129 i.e. , setting the two functions and their derivatives equal . remembering that @xmath130 that @xmath131 and that @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 one obtains @xmath135 inserting the above result into eq .",

    "respectively @xmath143 @xmath144 one finally obtains the first order result for @xmath145@xmath146    this is our final expression .",
    "the numerical evaluation was carried out initially by using mathematica @xciteto evaluate the integrals involving products of circular functions and @xmath147 .",
    "for example , if @xmath148 and @xmath149 are set equal to @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively , and using for @xmath152 the value stated above , one finds @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    "( [ pert1 ] ) the result @xmath156 which compares very well with the numerical result from table 3 @xmath157    the results for the scattering length and the effective range , described in the text , were calculated by a fortran code which expresses the integrals @xmath158dt$ ] and @xmath159dt$ ] in terms of the functions ci and si .",
