    "abundance measurements of long - lived radioactive neutron - capture species found in r - process - enhanced extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars offer the opportunity to determine the age of the progenitor object(s ) that contributed these elements into the presently observed stellar material , by comparison with r - process model predictions ( cowan et al .",
    "1999 ; meyer & truran 2000 ) .",
    "such age estimates do not rely on assumptions about galactic chemical evolution , yet provide constraints on the nature of r - process nucleosynthesis , and limits on the age of the galaxy and the universe .    so far",
    "this method has been applied to thorium observations in several emp stars . for the first time , uranium now has also been detected , in the emp halo star cs  31082 - 001 ( [ fe / h ] = 2.9 ) ( cayrel et al . 2001 ; also this volume ) . instead of one chronometer ",
    "the previously used [ th / x ] abundance ratio ( with x representing a reliably observed stable r - process element such as eu )  there are now three principal chronometer pairs available , [ th / x ] , [ u / x ] , and [ u / th ] .",
    "these chronometer pairs can be combined to obtain a more reliable age estimate ( see goriely & clerbaux 1999 ) . in that way",
    "one can also place another constraint on r - process model parameters by demanding consistency of the different inferred ages .",
    "r - process model parameters determined in this way for cs  31082 - 001 could then be used for more reliable age determinations of other stars , even those for which no u can be detected .",
    "we calculated the r - process production of @xmath2u and @xmath3th using the classical site - independent model ( cowan et al .",
    "1999 ) assuming ( n,@xmath4)-(@xmath4,n ) equilibrium ( waiting - point approximation ) and an iron seed .",
    "r - process abundances are obtained from a superposition of abundance distributions where weights and timescales obey a power law over the neutron density . assuming that the abundance pattern in cs  31082 - 001 resembles a solar r - process pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ figab ] ) , the four free parameters of the model are determined by fitting the calculated abundances to the solar system r - process abundances ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) at the 124@xmath5a@xmath5133 and 189@xmath5a@xmath5199 abundance peaks , as well as at pb . because pb is a product of @xmath6-decay chains like th and u , it provides an important constraint for the u and th production estimates ( pb has not yet been detected in cs  31082 - 001 , hill et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "the necessary nuclear physics input for our calculations are masses , @xmath7- decay half - lives , branchings for @xmath7-delayed neutron emission , and the rates of fission processes for very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "while we used experimental data where available , the vast majority of the required nuclear information needs to be predicted by theory . for comparison ,",
    "calculations were performed with two nuclear mass models , the frequently used etfsi - q ( pearson , nayak & goriely 1996 ) , and the recently developed hfbcs-1 ( tondeur , goriely & pearson 2000 ) , which we use here for the first time in a r - process calculation . the @xmath7-decay data were the same as in cowan et al .",
    "it has been emphasized before that the proper treatment of fission processes is crucial for calculating the r - process yields of thorium and uranium ( e.g. , cowan , thielemann & truran 1991 ; goriely & clerbaux 1999 ) . in this work",
    "we re - calculated neutron - induced fission , @xmath7-delayed fission , and spontaneous fission rates based on the new fission barriers from mamdouh et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using the methods outlined in kodoma & takahashi ( 1975 ) .",
    "ages were determined based on the predicted abundance ratios [ u / th ] , [ u / x ] , and [ th / x ] . to compensate for the deficiencies in the abundance predictions of stable r - process elements , and to reduce the impact of observational errors in the [ u / x ] and [ th / x ] ratios , we also fitted both the observed and the simulated elemental abundance pattern to the solar one . then the ratios [ u*f / u0 ] and [ th*f / th0 ] alone can be used for an age determination .",
    "( u * = observed stellar abundance , u0 = predicted abundance , f = normalization factor ) .",
    "we conducted an extensive investigation of the influence of uncertainties on the age determination .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath7-decay rates : to obtain a conservative estimate of the possible influence of errors in the @xmath7-decay data , we randomly changed the @xmath7-decay half lives by factors between 0.2 and 5 .",
    "branchings for @xmath7-delayed neutron emission were also varied .",
    "one hundred calculations were then made to determine the variance of the r - process abundance predictions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "( 2 ) model uncertainties : we determined the range of the four r - process model parameters that still result in a reasonable fit of the solar abundance pattern .",
    "this parameter range leads to an uncertainty @xmath9 in the predicted abundances . while this error is small for [ u / th ] , it turns out to be unacceptably large for the [ u / x ] and [ th / x ] ages .",
    "however , in this work we constrain the simulation parameters by requiring best possible consistency with the [ u / th ] age .",
    "this constraint leads to the same small @xmath9 for all abundance ratios .",
    "( 3 ) observational errors : these lead to uncertainties in the derived abundance ratios @xmath10 . ( 4 ) mass models : we determined the simulation parameters individually for the two mass models etfsi - q and hfbcs-1 .",
    "generally there is good agreement in the abundance predictions between the two calculations in the critical 230@xmath5a@xmath5260 mass region .",
    "yet , the pronounced drop in the calculated abundances in the mass region 229@xmath5a@xmath5238 before @xmath7-decay occurs 5 mass units earlier for the etfsi - q model , resulting in a somewhat lower th abundance and a higher age estimate .",
    "this is probably a consequence of a difference in the prediction of the onset of deformation in the @xmath11tl region .",
    "( 5 ) fit to abundance pattern : the scaling factor @xmath12 for the [ u*f / u0 ] and [ th*f / th0 ] age estimates has an error @xmath13 , originating from the discrepancies between the calculated and the observed abundance patterns for stable r - process elements ( see fig .",
    "[ figab ] ) .",

    "fission barriers ( + 0.9 gyr for the [ u / th ] age , 0.8 gyr for the [ u / x ] ages and 4 gyr ( ! ) for the [ th / x ] ages ) .",
    "while more theoretical work is needed , this indicates that @xmath7 delayed fission should not be neglected . while some of the predicted [ u / x ] and [ th / x ] ages agree well with [ u / th ] , others show discrepancies .",
    "the [ u*f / u0 ] and [ th*f / th0 ] ages average over these discrepancies , and at least [ u*f / u0 ] provides a reasonable age estimate as well ( [ th / x ] suffer from large observational uncertainties in the present data ) .",
    "however , we are now in the position to pick the [ u / x ] and [ th / x ] estimates that agree best with the [ u / th ] age .",
    "these are the ratios based on gd and ir abundances ( hill et al . ,",
    "this volume ) . our predicted ratios for [ th / gd ] and [ th / ir ] can therefore be used for improved age estimates of stars where no uranium can be detected . in principle , other observed [ th / x ] ratios could be used together with our calculations , if an appropriate correction factor would be applied .",
    "such a correction factor can now be determined by requiring consistency with [ th / ir ] and [ th / gd ] . however",
    ", it will be crucial to verify whether the consistency of the age estimates based on [ u / th ] , [ u / gd ] , and [ u / ir ] , as obtained from our r - process model , holds for a larger sample of emp stars .",
