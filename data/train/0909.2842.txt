    "[ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](a ) and  [ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](b ) , respectively ) are both negative at high @xmath11 , the lmr exhibits a steplike decrease caused by the spin - flop transition in every other cuo@xmath0 plane , and the tmr follows a @xmath59 dependence due to a smooth rotation of weak fm moments toward the @xmath24 direction . qualitatively similar behavior is observed in the in - plane mr for both @xmath24 orientations [ figs .",
    "[ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](c ) and  [ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](d ) ] . in analogy to the af lsco,@xcite here the negative mr probably also results from an increase of the hole localization length due to the reorientation of the fm moments in cuo@xmath5 planes.@xcite    just like in lsco ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lscomr ] ) , however , we find that the low-@xmath24 pmr emerges at low @xmath11 in li - lco in both @xmath57 and @xmath38 for both @xmath24 orientations [ figs .",
    "[ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](a)-(d ) ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath38 , the pmr becomes observable for @xmath60  k , _ i.e. _ below the spin freezing temperature @xmath61  k.@xcite it is intriguing to examine whether this pmr reflects the onset of charge glassiness in the same manner as in lsco .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](e ) for @xmath62 , the pmr in li - lco shows indeed the history dependent , multibranch behavior with the same characteristics as those first described in lsco for @xmath63 ( ref . ) .",
    "we stress that the hysteresis occurs only in the @xmath24 region where the pmr was initially observed ( path 1 ) after zero - field cooling ( zfc ) .",
    "the cycle 5 - 6 shows clearly the absence of hysteresis for @xmath64  t , where the mr is negative .",
    "the merging of paths 1 and 5 at @xmath65 t demonstrates that the system exhibits return - point memory , just like in lsco.@xcite    other similarities to lsco in the regime of charge glassiness include the dependence of @xmath66 on the cooling protocol.@xcite in particular , @xmath67 obtained after cooling in field @xmath68 is higher than the zfc @xmath67 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lilcomrhysteresis](f ) for @xmath38 and @xmath69",
    ". this difference decreases with increasing @xmath11 , and vanishes at a @xmath70 that grows with @xmath68 , at least for low enough @xmath68 .",
    "hence , in both li - lco and lsco , the novel , low-@xmath24 pmr strongly correlates with charge glassiness at low @xmath11 . in order to identify the microscopic origin of this pmr",
    ", we note that , since li - lco does not superconduct at any @xmath16 , superconducting fluctuations may be ruled out . likewise , orbital effects are not relevant , since @xmath42 does not exhibit the expected@xcite exponential enhancement with @xmath24 .",
    "we conclude that the pmr must be a spin related effect . however , it is known that , in the vrh regime , the effect of @xmath24 on cu spins leads to a negative,@xcite not positive mr .",
    "the remaining possibility is the coupling of @xmath24 to the spins of doped holes , which populate localized states within the mott - hubbard gap @xmath71 of the parent compound .",
    "those states have a predominantly oxygen character . in strongly disordered materials with mott vrh",
    ", it is indeed known that zeeman splitting in the presence of a coulomb repulsion @xmath72 between two holes in the same disorder - localized state leads to a pmr at low enough @xmath73 by blocking certain hopping channels.@xcite such a mr is described@xcite by a universal function of @xmath74 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that this function provides a good fit to the mr data in systems as diverse as quasi-2d in@xmath5o@xmath75 films@xcite and in - plane transport in 3d y@xmath6pr@xmath4ba@xmath5cu@xmath50o@xmath76.@xcite    in order to test whether the above mechanism can describe also the pmr data in lightly doped la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 , we analyze the in - plane transport in lsco at the lowest @xmath77  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lscomr](f ) ] .",
    "we find that all the @xmath14 data in the regime of pmr do collapse onto one function of a single scaling parameter [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lscomr](h ) ] .",
    "the scaling fails at higher @xmath11 , as expected,@xcite and at higher @xmath24 , where another mechanism leads to a negative mr.@xcite the in - plane pmr in li - lco obeys the same scaling , but the measurements could not be extended to @xmath78  k because of the high sample resistance . using the localization length @xmath79   obtained from the vrh fits@xcite and assuming the dielectric constant @xmath80 ( ref . )",
    ", we estimate @xmath81  k in lsco , so that @xmath73 is indeed satisfied in the experiment.@xcite thus , while unimportant at high @xmath11 , the coulomb repulsion between two holes in the same localized state plays a dominant role in the low-@xmath11 mr of lightly doped la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 .",
    "we remark that the out - of - plane transport in cuprates has been generally more difficult to understand and , accordingly , the @xmath21 curves at the lowest @xmath11 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lscomr](c ) ] can not be collapsed in the same manner .",
    "it is interesting that they do collapse as a function of @xmath82 ( not shown ) , where @xmath83 is an empirically determined parameter .",
    "this suggests the presence of some additional mechanism that may be captured by generalizing the model of ref .  , but we do not wish to speculate further .    since previous studies on lsco@xcite reported only an increasingly negative mr as @xmath11",
    "was reduced below @xmath12 [ see also figs .  [",
    "fig : lscomr](d ) and  [ fig : lscomr](e ) ] , the dramatic , qualitative change in the behavior of the mr from negative to positive at even lower @xmath11 is very surprising .",
    "there was no reason to expect the emergence of the low-@xmath11 pmr in doped la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 on theoretical grounds either . on the other hand , similar large pmr@xcite and charge glassiness@xcite",
    "have been observed in various nonmagnetic , disordered materials with strong coulomb interactions .",
    "the observed scaling of @xmath14 thus indicates that , to leading order , the magnetic background remains inactive .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of af domains , frozen at low @xmath11 , and holes confined to the domain walls .",
    "while low @xmath24 may be expected to produce some motion of the domain walls leading to a hysteretic mr , the main transport mechanism within the domain walls that gives rise to the pmr should remain unchanged .",
    "much higher @xmath24 will lead to the reorientation of the weak fm moments of the af domains and the associated negative mr,@xcite as observed .",
    "the charge glass observed in lightly doped la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 thus seems analogous to that in other disordered , interacting systems , except that here only holes in the domain walls contribute to transport and glassiness .",
    "the existence of such a charge cluster glass was also inferred from the noise and dielectric studies.@xcite a model of a gapped insulator with a short - range repulsive interaction shows@xcite that the disorder - induced localized states in the gap near the chemical potential are located inside the domain walls , and they are expected to lead to glassy dynamics , similar to our observations . while the data suggest that a charge glass ground state might be universal in strongly interacting , disordered systems , the question of how it evolves into a hts in some cases ( _ e.g. _ lsco ) and not in others ( _ e.g. _ li - lco ) remains open .",
    "however , the novel hysteretic pmr provides a practical tool for detecting an underlying charge glassiness confined to the domain walls .",
    "this method could be applied at higher @xmath16 and in systems with less disorder , such as ybco , to determine whether charge inhomogeneities are intrinsic or driven by disorder .",
    "in fact , there is some preliminary evidence of the hysteretic pmr in the nel state in ybco at low @xmath11.@xcite",
    "we have demonstrated that a positive magnetoresistance associated with charge glassiness emerges in lightly doped la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 deep within the sg phase .",
    "this is observed in both in - plane and out - of - plane transport , regardless of the direction of the magnetic field , type of dopant , or presence of long - range or short - range af order .",
    "it is striking that , as @xmath13 , this material shows behavior that is characteristic of systems that are far from any magnetic ordering .",
