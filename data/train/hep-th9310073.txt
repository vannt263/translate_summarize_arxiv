    "since the propagation of strings in curved spacetimes started to be systematically investigated , a variety of new physical phenomena appeared @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these results are relevant both for fundamental ( quantum ) strings and for cosmic strings which behave essentially in a classical way .",
    "string propagation has been investigated in non - linear gravitational plane waves @xcite and shock - waves @xcite , black holes @xcite , conical spacetimes @xcite , and cosmological spacetimes @xcite,@xcite .    among the cosmological backgrounds , de sitter spacetime occupies a special place .",
    "this is , in one hand relevant for inflation and on the other hand string propagation turns to be specially interesting there @xcite,@xcite .",
    "string unstability , in the sense that the string proper length grows indefinitely is particularly present in de sitter .",
    "the string dynamics in de sitter universe is described by a generalized sinh - gordon model with a potential unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "the sinh - gordon function @xmath15 having a clear physical meaning : @xmath16 determines the string proper length .",
    "moreover the classical string equations of motion ( plus the string constraints ) turn to be integrable in de sitter universe @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more precisely , they are equivalent to a non - linear sigma model on the grassmannian @xmath17 with periodic boundary conditions ( for closed strings ) .",
    "this sigma model has an associated linear system @xcite and using it , one can show the presence of an infinite number of conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the string constraints imply a zero energy - momentum tensor and these constraints are compatible with the integrability .",
    "the so - called dressing method @xcite in soliton theory allows to construct solutions of non - linear classically integrable models using the associated linear system . in the present paper",
    "we systematically construct string solutions in three dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "we start from a given exactly known solution of the string equations of motion and constraints in de sitter @xcite and then we `` dress '' it .",
    "the string solutions reported here indeed apply to cosmic strings in de sitter spacetime as well .",
    "the dynamics of cosmic strings in expanding universes has been studied in the literature for the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cases ( see for example @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it must be noticed that the string behaviour we found here in de sitter universe is essentially * different * from the standard frw where the expansion factor @xmath18 is a positive power of the cosmic time @xmath9 . in such frw universes , strings always oscillate in time , the comoving spatial string coordinates _ contract _ and the proper string size stays _ constant _ asymptotically for @xmath11 @xcite,@xcite . in the cosmic string literature",
    "this is known as string stretching. we called such behaviour stable @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . on the contrary , in de sitter spacetime ,",
    "as we show below , two types of asymptotic behaviors are present : ( i ) the proper string size and energy grow with the expansion factor ( unstable behaviour ) or ( ii ) they tend to constant values ( stable strings ) .",
    "the unstable string solutions in de sitter universe may provide a mechanism to self - sustain inflation as proposed in refs.@xcite-@xcite without advocating an inflaton field .",
    "the multi - string exact solutions in de sitter spacetime presented here should provide essential clues about the feasability of inflationary string scenarios .",
    "we apply here the dressing method as follows .",
    "we start from the exact ring - shaped string solution @xmath19 @xcite and we find the explicit solution @xmath20 of the associated linear system , where @xmath3 stands for the spectral parameter .",
    "then , we propose a new solution @xmath21 that differs from @xmath20 by a matrix rational in @xmath3 .",
    "notice that @xmath22 provides in general a new string solution .",
    "we then show that this rational matrix must have at least * four * poles , @xmath4 , as a consequence of the symmetries of the problem .",
    "the residues of these poles are shown to be one - dimensional projectors .",
    "we then prove that these projectors are formed by vectors which can all be expressed in terms of an arbitrary complex constant vector @xmath23 and the complex parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this result holds for arbitrary starting solutions @xmath19 .",
    "since we consider closed strings , we impose a @xmath25-periodicity on the string variable @xmath26 .",
    "this restricts @xmath24 to take discrete values that we succeed to express in terms of pythagorean numbers . in summary ,",
    "our solutions depend on two arbitrary complex numbers contained in @xmath23 and two integers @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the counting of degrees of freedom is analogous to @xmath29 minkowski spacetime except that left and right modes are here mixed up in a non - linear and precise way .",
    "the vector @xmath23 somehow indicates the polarization of the string .",
    "the integers @xmath7 determine the string winding .",
    "they fix the way in which the string winds around the origin in the spatial dimensions ( here @xmath30 ) .",
    "our starting solution @xmath31 is a stable string winded @xmath32 times around the origin in de sitter space .",
    "the matrix multiplications involved in the computation of the final solution were done with the help of the computer program of symbolic calculation `` mathematica '' .",
    "the resulting solution @xmath33 is a complicated combination of trigonometric functions of @xmath26 and hyperbolic functions of @xmath10 .",
    "that is , these string solitonic solutions do not oscillate in time .",
    "this is a typical feature of string unstability @xcite-@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the new feature here is that strings ( even stable solutions ) do not oscillate neither for @xmath34 , nor for @xmath35 .",
    "3 - 4 depict spatial projections @xmath36 of the solutions for two given polarizations @xmath37 and different windings @xmath38 .",
    "we plot in figs .",
    "5 - 11 the solutions for significative values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in terms of the comoving coordinates @xmath39 @xmath40 the first feature to point out is that our solitonic solutions describe * multiple * ( here five or three ) strings , as it can be seen from the fact that for a given time @xmath9 we find several different values for @xmath10 .",
    "that is , @xmath10 is a * multivalued * function of @xmath9 for any fixed @xmath41 ( fig.5 - 6 ) .",
    "each branch of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath9 corresponds to a different string .",
    "this is a entirely new feature for strings in curved spacetime , with no analogue in flat spacetime where the time coordinate can always be chosen proportional to @xmath10 . in flat",
    "spacetime , multiple string solutions are described by multiple world - sheets . here",
    ", we have a * single * world - sheet describing several independent and simultaneous strings as a consequence of the coupling with the spacetime geometry .",
    "notice that we consider _ free _ strings .",
    "( interactions among the strings as splitting or merging are not considered ) .",
    "five is the generic number of strings in our dressed solutions .",
    "the value five can be related to the fact that we are dressing a one - string solution ( @xmath19 ) with _ four _ poles .",
    "each pole adds here an unstable string .    in order to describe the real physical evolution ,",
    "we eliminated numerically @xmath42 from the solution and expressed the spatial comoving coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath41 .",
    "we plot @xmath45 as a function of @xmath41 for different fixed values of @xmath9 in fig.7 - 8 .",
    "it is a sinusoidal - type function .",
    "besides the customary closed string period @xmath25 , another period appears which varies on @xmath10 . for small @xmath46",
    ", @xmath47 has a convoluted shape while for larger @xmath48 ( here @xmath49 ) , it becomes a regular sinusoid .",
    "these behaviours reflect very clearly in the evolution of the spatial coordinates and shape of the string .",
    "the evolution of the five ( and three ) strings simultaneously described by our solution as a function of @xmath9 , for positive @xmath9 is shown in figs . 9 - 11 .",
    "one string is stable ( the 5th one ) .",
    "the other four are unstable . for the stable string , @xmath50 contracts in time",
    "precisely as @xmath51 , thus keeping the proper amplitude @xmath52 and proper size constant . for this",
    "stable string @xmath53 .",
    "( @xmath54 = the horizon radius ) .",
    "for the other ( unstable ) strings , @xmath50 become very fast constant in time , the proper size expanding as the universe itself like @xmath55 .",
    "for these strings @xmath56 .",
    "these exact solutions display remarkably the asymptotic string behaviour found in refs.@xcite,@xcite .    in terms of the sinh - gordon description",
    ", this means that for the strings outside the horizon the sinh - gordon function @xmath15 is the same as the cosmic time @xmath9 up to a function of @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath57 \\right\\ } + o(e^{-2ht } ) .",
    "\\label{tcosa}\\ ] ] here @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the @xmath43 and @xmath44 coordinates outside the horizon . for @xmath60",
    "these strings are at the absolute _ minimun _ @xmath61 of the sinh - gordon potential with infinite size .",
    "the string inside the horizon ( stable string ) corresponds to the _ maximun _ of the potential , @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is the only value in which the string can stay without being pushed down by the potential to @xmath64 and this also explains why only one stable string appears ( is not possible to put more than one string at the maximun of the potential without falling down ) .",
    "these features are _ generically _ exhibited by our one - soliton multistring solutions , independently of the particular initial state of the string ( fixed by @xmath65 and @xmath7 ) . for particular values of @xmath65 , the solution describes three strings , with symmetric shapes from @xmath66 , for instance like a rosette or a circle with festoons ( fig . 9 - 11 ) .",
    "the string solutions presented here trivially embedd on d - dimensional de sitter spacetime ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it must be noticed that they exhibit the essential physics of strings in d - dimensional de sitter universe . moreover ,",
    "the construction method used here works in any number of dimensions .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we describe the string equations in de sitter universe and its associated linear system .",
    "section 3 deals with the dressing method in soliton theory , its application to this string problem and the systematic construction of solutions . in section 4 we explicitly describe the starting background solution @xmath68 and the solution @xmath20 of the associated linear system . in section 5 ,",
    "we analyze our multistring solutions and describe their physical properties .",
    "the string equations of motion in @xmath69-dimensional de sitter space - time can be written in the following form :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is a ( @xmath72)-dimensional real vector of unit pseudolength @xmath73 and @xmath74 are light cone coordinates in the world sheet : @xmath75    in addition , we have the string constraints ( conformal conditions ) @xmath76 the solution @xmath71 should be a periodic function of @xmath77 , with period @xmath78 for closed strings .",
    "we are going to find solutions of this equation by using the riemann transform method @xcite .",
    "the most important observation is that equation ( [ seq ] ) can be rewritten in the form of a chiral field model on the grassmanian @xmath79.indeed , any element @xmath80 can be parametrized with a real vector @xmath71 of the unit pseudolength @xmath81 in terms of @xmath82 , the string equations ( [ seq])-([scond ] ) have the following form @xmath83 and the conformal constraints are @xmath84 which are equivalent to eqs.([scond ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath80 implies that @xmath85 is a real matrix with the following properties :    @xmath86    these conditions are equivalent to the existence of the representation ( [ g ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ geq ] ) is the compatibility condition for the following overdetermined linear system : @xmath87 where @xmath88 or in terms of vector @xmath71 @xmath89 @xmath90 in order to fix the freedom in the definition of @xmath91 we shall identify @xmath92    this condition is compatible with the above equations since the matrix function @xmath91 at the point @xmath93 satisfies the same equations as @xmath82 .",
    "thus the problem of constructing exact solutions of the string equations is reduced to finding compatible solutions of the linear equations ( [ psieq ] ) such that @xmath94 satisfies the constraints eqs.([gcond ] ) and ( [ gcond1 ] ) .",
    "we will consider now the symmetry group ( or the so called `` reduction group '' @xcite , @xcite ) enjoyed by the linear system of equations @xmath95 when eqs.([gcond1 ] ) hold .",
    "it follows from the condition @xmath96 that the matrix @xmath97 anticommutes with @xmath98 and @xmath99 : @xmath100 this implies that the matrix function @xmath101 satisfies the same equation as @xmath102 : @xmath103_{\\xi}= \\frac{u}{1-\\lambda } [ g \\psi(1/\\lambda ) ] , \\ \\ \\ [ g \\psi(1/\\lambda ) ] _ { \\eta}= \\frac{v}{1+\\lambda } [ g \\psi(1/\\lambda ) ] , \\label{psieq2}\\ ] ] then , it can differ from @xmath102 only on a matrix multiplier which does not depend on @xmath104 : @xmath105    the vector @xmath106 , the corresponding matrix @xmath82 and the currents @xmath107 are real .",
    "therefore @xmath108 is a solution of equations ( [ psieq ] ) as well , and we have @xmath109 in addition , by using eq.([gr2 ] ) twice , we find @xmath110    the fact that @xmath111 yields @xmath112 and implies that @xmath113 obeys the same equation ( [ psieq ] ) as @xmath102    @xmath114    the transformations ( [ gr1]),([gr2 ] ) and ( [ gr3 ] ) generate a finite group which is called the reduction group of the problem and which guarantees that the properties ( [ gcond1 ] ) hold for @xmath94 .",
    "suppose we know a particular solution @xmath115 of the string equations ( [ seq ] ) .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath116 its corresponding currents ( [ uv ] ) , and by @xmath117 , the corresponding compatible solution of the overdetermined system ( [ psieq ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath118 as well as @xmath119 and @xmath120 are explicitly known .    to construct a new solution @xmath121 we assume that the corresponding @xmath91 function differs from @xmath122 on a rational matrix multiplier @xmath123 @xmath124",
    "we assume that @xmath125 is rational in @xmath126 , but , of course it might have a complex dependence in @xmath127 .",
    "the dressing method consist on finding a matrix @xmath128 such that @xmath129 given by eqs.([phipsi ] ) fulfils the linear system ( [ psieq1 ] ) and the symmetry conditions ( [ gr1])-([gr3 ] ) .",
    "then , once @xmath125 is known , the string solution @xmath130 follows from eq.([l0 g ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ l0g]),([gr1 ] ) and ( [ phipsi ] ) that @xmath131 should obey the following symmetries : @xmath132    we assume that the constant matrices @xmath133 and @xmath134 coincide for the dressed and the undressed solutions .",
    "suppose that the rational function @xmath135 has a pole at the point @xmath136 .",
    "it follows from eqs.([gru1 ] ) and ( [ gru2 ] ) that it must have poles at the points @xmath137 as well and , in addition , @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the simplest ( generic ) possible case is @xmath139 where @xmath140 are matrix functions of @xmath141 to be determined below .",
    "this simplest case will be called the _ one - soliton solution _ from now on .",
    "we choose this name since in the context of non - linear integrable equations in an infinite space interval ( the sine - gordon equation , for instance ) , this minimal pole - structure ( the minimal number of poles compatible with the symmetry group ) in @xmath3 generates the _ one soliton _ solution ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "here we have taken into account eqs.([gru2 ] ) and ( [ gru1 ] ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ gru3 ] ) that @xmath142 here   denotes hermitian conjugation of a matrix .",
    "the condition @xmath143 can be imposed in the following way : the right hand side ( @xmath144 ) is a rational function of @xmath126 which takes the value @xmath145 at the point @xmath146 , then @xmath144 will be identically @xmath145 if it does not have any singularity on the riemann sphere of @xmath126 .",
    "double poles would vanish if and only if @xmath147 thus the matrices @xmath140 are degenerated and we can write them as a sum of bivectors @xmath148 the constraints ( [ aa ] ) imply @xmath149 which means that the vectors @xmath150 are null and mutually pseudo - orthogonal .",
    "therefore , since pseudo - orthogonal null vectors are proportional , we have @xmath151 and without loss of generality , we take : @xmath152 now the constraints ( [ aa ] ) read @xmath153    in addition , by requiring the residues of @xmath144 to vanish at the points @xmath154 , we get    @xmath155    later on we shall demonstrate that the periodicity condition on @xmath156 can be satisfied only in the case where all poles ( @xmath157 ) of @xmath135 are purely imaginary [ see eqs.([lammu]),([alfa ] ) and ( [ pita ] ) ] .",
    "from now on , we shall denote @xmath158 . substituting the bivectoral representation ( [ ab ] ) in the above equations and by separating bivectors we get the system of vector equations with respect to @xmath159 @xmath160 by bivectoral separations we mean the following trick :",
    "suppose ve have an equation of the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 are vectors and @xmath163 .",

    "since @xmath177 satisfies the conditions ( [ gcond1 ] ) , it has the form of eq.([g ] ) and the corresponding vector @xmath106 , can be found by projecting eq.([g ] ) on an arbitrary constant vector @xmath180 .",

    "we find in this way : @xmath182    now , to construct a solution @xmath106 of the string equations ( [ seq ] , [ scond ] ) , one needs only to determine the dependence of @xmath179 and @xmath178 on the variables @xmath183 .",
    "now the problem is to find the evolution of @xmath179 and @xmath178 in @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
