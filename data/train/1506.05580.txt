    "a long standing problem in the theoretical study of heavy ion collisions is the time evolution of the pressure tensor and its isotropization  @xcite .",
    "this question is closely related to the use of hydrodynamics in the modeling of heavy ion collisions .",
    "although the complete isotropy of the pressure tensor is not necessary @xcite for the validity of hydrodynamical descriptions , the ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressure , @xmath2 , should increase with time for a smooth matching between the pre - hydro model and hydrodynamics .    in most models with boost invariant initial conditions , the longitudinal pressure is negative immediately after the collision @xcite ( in the color glass condensate framework @xcite , this can be understood as a consequence of large longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields ) . on timescales of the order of a few @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the saturation momentum ) , the longitudinal pressure rises , and reaches a positive value of comparable magnitude to the transverse pressure .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the scatterings are strong enough to sustain this mild anisotropy , or whether the longitudinal expansion wins and causes the anisotropy to increase .",
    "this regime may be addressed by various tools .",
    "indeed , it corresponds to a period where the gluon occupation number is still large compared to 1 , but small compared to the inverse coupling @xmath5 so that a quasi - particle picture may be valid .",
    "this means that the system could in principle be described either in terms of fields or in terms of particles .",
    "since the occupation number is large , it is tempting to treat the system as purely classical . in a description in terms of fields",
    ", this amounts to considering classical solutions of the field equations of motion , averaged over a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions whose variance is proportional to the initial occupation number . in a description in terms of particles , _",
    "i.e. _  kinetic theory , this amounts to keeping in the collision integral of the boltzmann equation only the terms that have the highest degree in the occupation number @xcite .",
    "the field theory version of this classical approximation has been implemented recently @xcite for scalar fields with longitudinal expansion , and it leads to a decrease of the ratio @xmath2 , like the power @xmath6 of the proper time .",
    "this behavior seems universal ; it has been observed for a wide range of initial conditions , and both for yang - mills theory and scalar field theories with a point - like interaction ( such as a @xmath0 interaction ) @xcite . based on this observation ,",
    "it was conjectured that the time evolution of @xmath2 can be decomposed in three stages , nicely summarized in figure 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite  :    * a transient stage that depends on the details of the initial condition ; * a universal scaling stage , called `` classical attractor , '' during which the dynamics is purely classical and the ratio @xmath2 decreases as @xmath6 ; * a final stage where the occupation number has become of order 1 , and where quantum corrections are important . the isotropization of the pressure tensor may happen during this final stage .      however , a possible difficulty with the classical approximation is that the occupation number can not be large uniformly at all momenta , which may make this approximation unreliable since the dynamics integrates over all the momentum modes .",
    "in particular , this may be the case in anisotropic systems , as we shall explain now in a kinetic theory framework .",
    "suppose for discussion that the particle distribution has become extremely anisotropic , with a narrow support in @xmath7 , @xmath8 this situation occurs in the pre - equilibrium stage of heavy ion collisions , that can be described at leading order by a rapidity independent classical color field . in a non expanding system",
    ", we expect that @xmath1 scatterings will kick particles out of the transverse plane and restore the isotropy of the distribution .    the boltzmann equation that describes the evolution of @xmath9 should be able to capture this isotropization .",
    "if we track the momentum @xmath10 ( see figure [ fig:22scatt ] ) , the boltzmann equation can be sketched as follows : @xmath11 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad + \\,g^4\\int\\limits_{p_{1,2,3}}\\cdots\\big[f_1f_2-\\underline{f_3f_4}\\big]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : boltz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have separated the purely classical terms ( cubic in @xmath12 ) from the subleading terms that are quadratic in @xmath12 .",
    "the classical approximation amounts to dropping the quadratic terms .",
    "the usual justification of this approximation is to say that the cubic terms are much larger than the quadratic ones when @xmath13 .",
    "however , as we shall see now , this counting is too naive when the support of @xmath12 is anisotropic .    if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in the transverse plane , then @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , if we request that the particle 4 is produced outside of the transverse plane , then we have @xmath17 . because of this , many pieces of the collision term ( underlined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) ) are zero . in particular , all the classical terms vanish .",
    "the physical interpretation is clear : the @xmath18 terms correspond to stimulated emission , which can not happen when both final particles lie in an empty region of phase space .",
    "the only non - zero term is the one in @xmath19 , but one must go beyond the classical approximation in order to capture it .",
    "this is true no matter how large the distribution @xmath20 is inside its support , _",
    "i.e. _  even if the classicality condition @xmath21 is satisfied there . moreover , this argument can be trivially generalized to any @xmath22 scattering process in kinetic theory collision term contains only terms of degree @xmath23 . because of longitudinal momentum conservation , if one of the momenta points out of the transverse plane , then there must be at least one out - of - plane momentum .",
    "therefore , of the @xmath24 distribution functions , at least one is zero . ] .",
    "therefore , when the particle distribution is anisotropic , the classical approximation artificially suppresses out - of - plane scatterings at large angle , possibly resulting in wrong conclusions regarding isotropization .    now let us relax the @xmath25 function assumption , and consider the case where the range of angles with large occupancy is finite but narrow .",
    "in particular , suppose that for momenta @xmath26 , the particles mostly reside with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 describes how anisotropic the momentum distribution is .",
    "we are interested in scattering processes which move particles out of this highly - occupied region .",
    "so consider a @xmath29 scattering process , where the final momentum @xmath10 lies outside this highly - occupied region , so @xmath30 is small . within the classical approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) is dominated by the @xmath31 term .",
    "but for all three of these occupancies to be large , we need @xmath32 . since @xmath33 , this ensures that @xmath34 , that is , the final state particle produced in a classical scattering must still have quite a small @xmath35 value .",
    "we will refer to these as classical scatterings .",
    "a scattering with @xmath36 and @xmath37 will always be suppressed by a small occupancy in the classical approximation , so these scatterings can be neglected classically , and only occur because of the quantum @xmath38 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) . we will call these quantum scatterings .",
    "now let us see whether scatterings with @xmath39 may still be important , even if the occupancies @xmath40 are large .",
    "first of all , while the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) is small for quantum scatterings , the integration phase space is much larger for these processes .",
    "specifically , since @xmath41 in all cases , and because of the momentum - conserving delta function , the phase space for `` quantum '' scatterings is larger than that for `` classical '' scatterings by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , even if the occupancy in the highly - occupied region is @xmath43 , order-1 of the scatterings are `` quantum . ''",
    "that is , order-1 of the scatterings involve quantum effects when the _ angle - averaged _ occupancy below @xmath26 is order 1 .",
    "this argument may not apply in gauge theories , where the matrix element is strongly enhanced for small - angle processes , but it should be valid in a scalar theory where the matrix element is isotropic .",
    "in addition , for many purposes , an individual scattering resulting in @xmath44 is much more important than a scattering resulting in @xmath45 . a particle s contribution to",
    "the longitudinal pressure involves @xmath46 .",
    "the particle produced in a `` quantum '' scattering , with @xmath47 , contributes more to the longitudinal pressure than the classically - scattered @xmath48 particle , by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in terms of generating longitudinal pressure , each `` quantum '' scattering contributes a more important effect , by a factor of @xmath50 . combining this factor with the larger phase space for quantum scattering",
    ", we find that , for the purposes of understanding the longitudinal pressure , the classical approximation already starts to fail when @xmath51 , which is when the angle - averaged occupancy is @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that the classical approximation may lead to missing some contributions that are important for isotropization in theories where the cross - section is dominated by large - angle scatterings , such as a @xmath0 scalar theory .",
    "when the classical approximation is used in this theory , it has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ratio @xmath2 decreases like @xmath6 at late times for a longitudinally expanding system ( dotted curve in figure [ fig : iso ] ) .",
    "given the above argument , the @xmath53 terms that are neglected in the classical approximation could alter this behavior sooner than one might naively expect , ending the growth of anisotropy and giving a ratio @xmath54 at late times .",
    "if the @xmath53 terms are truly negligible over some extended period of time , then the full boltzmann equation should lead to the red curve in figure [ fig : iso ] ,    in which the system spends some time stuck into a classical attractor before eventually leaving it in order to isotropize ( this red curve corresponds to the 3-stage scenario of section [ sec : scen ] ) .",
    "in contrast , if the @xmath53 terms are important from the start , one may get the behavior illustrated by the blue curve , where the power law @xmath6 does not play any particular role in the evolution of @xmath2 and a classical attractor would not exist .      in the rest of this paper , in order to assess quantitatively this issue , we solve the boltzmann equation for an expanding system of scalar bosons with a @xmath0 interaction , both for the full collision kernel and its classical approximation . in section [ sec : boltz ]",
    ", we discuss the boltzmann equation for a longitudinally expanding system and prepare the stage for its numerical resolution .",
    "we describe our algorithm in section [ sec : num ] , and the numerical results are exposed in section [ sec : resolution of the boltzmann equation ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "some more technical material and digressions are presented in appendices . in appendix",
    "[ sec : non - expanding system ] , we present results on the isotropization of the pressure tensor in a non - expanding system , that corroborate the fact that the @xmath53 terms play an essential role . in appendix [ sec : apa ] , we derive an analytical expression for the azimuthal integrals of the @xmath1 collision term .",
    "additional details about our algorithm can be found in appendices [ sec : apb ] and [ sec : apc ] . in the appendix [ app : dsmc ]",
    ", we present an alternate algorithm for solving the boltzmann equation , based on the direct simulation monte - carlo ( dsmc ) method .",
    "in the following , we consider partially anisotropic particle distributions that have a residual axial symmetry around the @xmath55 axis , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . for simplicity , we do not write explicitly the space and time dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath12 depends smoothly on momentum , except possibly at @xmath58 if there is a bose - einstein condensate ( see section [ sec : bose - einstein condensate ] ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath12 is even in the longitudinal momentum @xmath59 @xmath60 the lorentz covariant form of the boltzmann equation reads @xmath61\\ , , \\label{eq : bolt - sk}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 $ ] is the collision term ( see the subsection [ sec : collision term ] ) .",
    "this form of the equation can then be specialized to any system of coordinates .",
    "we will focus on the collision term which arises at lowest order in the coupling , which for @xmath0 theory is elastic @xmath63 scattering . for a system that expands in a boost invariant way in the longitudinal direction , the most appropriate system of coordinates is @xmath64 for the space - time",
    "coordinate and @xmath65 for the momentum of the particle , which are related to the usual cartesian coordinates and momenta by @xmath66 the assumed boost invariance of the problem implies that the distribution @xmath12 does not depend separately on @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but only on the difference @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to derive the equation for the distribution at mid - rapidity , @xmath70 . for simplicity , we will further assume that the distribution is independent of the transverse position .      in the system of coordinates defined in eqs .",

    "a central question in this paper is the interplay between the classical approximation and isotropization .",

    "indeed , @xmath163 , so that a fixed cutoff on @xmath59 roughly corresponds to a cutoff on @xmath162 that grows linearly with time . fortunately , we do not expect physical effects from these cutoffs if they are taken high enough , since the occupancy typically falls off exponentially at large energy and momentum .",
