    "the classification of the topological insulators is intrinsically related to the classification of the fiber bundles .",
    "intuitively , a fiber bundle is a collection of spaces , called fibers , that are indexed by a set of parameters that live on a manifold .",
    "the parameter space is called the base manifold and the reunion of all fibers is called the total space .",
    "an alternative view is to imagine the fibers as being attached to the points of the base manifold and then glued together by a prescribed topology .",
    "the fiber bundles encountered in condensed matter theory are generated by families of projectors @xmath3 , where @xmath4 s live on a manifold @xmath5 like the sphere , torus etc .. these projectors act on the same hilbert space @xmath6 and they generate the fibers @xmath7=@xmath8 . since these fibers are embedded in the big hilbert space @xmath6 , one can tell when two fibers @xmath7 and @xmath9 are close to each other and when they are not , therefore the bundle of fibers is already equipped with a topology .",
    "most of the fiber bundles studied in condensed matter are generated for finite samples by imposing parametrically dependent boundary conditions . to be more specific ,",
    "consider a real space 2d lattice with @xmath10 quantum states per site and assume that a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath11 has been defined .",
    "the wave functions are @xmath10 dimensional complex vector fields defined over the finite lattice : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "assume that we diagonalize @xmath11 by imposing boundary conditions like : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two @xmath10@xmath18@xmath10 matrices depending parametrically on @xmath4=@xmath19 .",
    "assume that , after the diagonalization , we find that the energy spectrum has a gap for all the allowed @xmath4 s .",
    "in this case , we can construct a fiber bundle by simply considering the projectors @xmath3 onto the states with energy below this gap .    while this is a straightforward construction which pertains to easy numerical implementations",
    ", it has a few drawbacks which are very often overlooked .",
    "the possibilities of choosing the two matrices seem endless and same can be said about the parameter space .",
    "how can one then discern between a meaningful construction and the rest ?",
    "the ultimate goal of these fiber bundle constructions is to characterize the bulk .",
    "therefore , only a rigorous study of the thermodynamic limit can filter out the irrelevant matrices and the wrong parameter spaces .",
    "most of the constructions will not survive in the thermodynamic limit either because the energy gap closes at some point or because the fibers seize to depend smoothly on the parameters . unfortunately , studying the thermodynamic limit requires tedious numerical simulations , which most of the time can be carried only up to relatively small sample sizes .",
    "in fact , it is very rare when such studies are performed at all .",
    "we will discuss in the next section how to define fiber bundles directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we now turn to the problem of classifying the fiber bundles .",
    "if the dimension of the fibers @xmath7 is @xmath10 , the fiber bundle generated by a family of projections is a u(@xmath10 ) fiber bundle because two fibers @xmath7 and @xmath9 can be linked by a unitary transformation @xmath20 .",
    "the question of how many topologically non - equivalent @xmath21 fiber bundles can be build over a manifold @xmath5 has been answered long time ago.@xcite it turns out that there is a universal manifold @xmath22 , called classifying space , such that all u(@xmath10 ) fiber bundles over @xmath5 can be generated from continuous functions @xmath23 , via the so called pull - back construction .",
    "describing this pull - back construction is rather technical , but here is a very simple result : two fiber bundles over @xmath5 generated by @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be continuously deformed into each other if and only if the two functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be continuously deformed into each other .",
    "therefore , classifying the u(@xmath10 ) fiber bundles over a manifold @xmath5 is equivalent to classifying the continuous functions from @xmath5 to @xmath22 .",
    "while a fundamental result in the fiber bundle theory , this classification algorithm is somewhat formal because the space @xmath22 is quite complicate [ it is the infinite grassmannian manifold @xmath26 .    a new development in the classification of low dimensional fiber bundles came from the work of panati.@xcite this work provides a computationally more manageable classifying approach and states , among other important things , that the fiber bundles over 2 dimensional manifolds without boundaries are completely classified by their chern numbers . note that the chern number is just one invariant among many topologic invariants that can be associated with a fiber bundle .",
    "the chern number can be explicitly computed by integrating the berry curvature form : @xmath27\\}d\\theta_1 \\wedge d \\theta_2,\\ ] ] over the base manifold : @xmath28 the result of such integration is always an integer and this integer number is called the chern number .",
    "given panati s result,@xcite it is clear that in 2 dimensions there are no magic new topological numbers .",
    "therefore , the spin - chern number must be related to the classical chern number .",
    "as we shall see , this is indeed the case , but what is new is the structures for which the chern number is computed .",
    "there is one simple case in which one can work directly with infinite samples .",
    "this is the case of translational invariant hamiltonians where one can use the bloch fibration .",
    "the bloch fibration is a unitary transformation from the hilbert space of the infinite sample into a continuum direct sum of @xmath10 dimensional complex spaces : @xmath29 where @xmath30 lives on the brillouin torus @xmath31$]@xmath18@xmath32 $ ] .",
    "@xmath33 transforms the original hamiltonian in a direct sum of bloch hamiltonians : @xmath34 obtaining the explicit expressions of @xmath35 is , most of the time , a very simple exercise . since @xmath33 is an isometry , if @xmath11 has an energy gap , then all @xmath35 have an energy gap .",
    "we can then compute the projectors @xmath36 for the states below this gap and define the fiber bundle @xmath37 , with the brillouin torus @xmath38 as the base manifold .",
    "consequently , we can compute a chern number directly for the infinite sample .",
    "consider now the case when the translational symmetry is lost , such as when disorder is present .",
    "for simplicity let us assume that the bulk gap remains open .",
    "if this is the case , we can define the total space simply as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the projector onto the states below the gap , but how can we define a base manifold without the brillouin torus ?",
    "it turns out that the only way out of this dilemma is to define a non - commutative brillouin torus , that is a torus whose points are operators instead of simple points on a manifold .",
    "describing this non - commutative torus is quite technical , but we can describe , in quite simple terms , how to define the chern number .",
    "let us show how this definition emerges from the translational invariant case .",
    "the chern number computed as @xmath41 with the berry curvature given in eq .",
    "[ bc ] ( where @xmath30 takes the place of @xmath4 ) has an expression in the real space : @xmath42,[\\hat{n}_2,p ] \\right ] \\},\\ ] ] where tr means trace over the quantum states at the origin , @xmath43 $ ] denotes the usual commutator and @xmath44 is the position operator : @xmath45 ( @xmath46=1,2 ) .",
    "one can see that we do nt really need the brillouin torus to define the chern number !",
    "therefore , one could try to define the chern number for the disordered case using this expression .",
    "the main question is , will this number be an integer ?",
    "a fundamental result in non - commutative geometry says that this is indeed the case after averaging over the disorder .",
    "we would like to state this result in more precise terms .",
    "for this we need to describe the disorder more precisely . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the addition of a random potential to @xmath11 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a random variable and @xmath49 is the index of the quantum states ( @xmath49=@xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath51 represents a particular disordered configuration and can be viewed as a point in the disorder configuration space @xmath52 , which must be equipped with a probability measure @xmath53 to be used for averaging over the disorder .",
    "we assume that the macroscopic state is translational invariant , in which case the lattice translations induce unitary transformations @xmath54 on @xmath6 and flows @xmath55 on @xmath52 such that @xmath56 .",
    "the probability measure @xmath53 is assumed invariant and ergodic with respected to the flows @xmath55 .",
    "a concrete example will be the white noise , for which the disorder configuration space is the infinite cartesian product of @xmath57 $ ] intervals : @xmath58.\\ ] ] a point @xmath51 of this space is an infinite sequence : @xmath59 and @xmath60 is taken as @xmath61 .",
    "the probability measure @xmath62 is given by the infinite product of measures : @xmath63 .",
    "the ergodic flow is simply @xmath64 .    with these being",
    "said , consider a family of projectors @xmath65 acting on the whole hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "we can now state the following rigorous result:@xcite    * proposition 1 . *",
    "if the matrix element @xmath66 decays sufficiently fast ( exponential decay is enough ) with the separation @xmath67 and if @xmath65 s satisfy @xmath68 , then : @xmath69,[n_2,p_\\omega]]\\}\\ ] ] is an integer that is invariant to smooth deformations of @xmath65 s as long as they remain localized .",
    "this is a very general results and it applies to any family of projectors and any type of disorder as long as the conditions inside the proposition s statement are satisfied .",
    "if the projectors @xmath65 are associated to the spectral projectors onto the occupied states of a hamiltonian , the chern number defined above gives the disorder averaged hall conductance .",
    "proposition 1 tells us that this average remains quantized even in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "since the hall plateaus can not be explained without the strong disorder , it was the above statement that completed our understanding of iqhe .",

    "let us neglect the disorder for a moment and let @xmath40 denote the spectral projector onto the states below the insulating gap of @xmath81 . under the bloch fibration @xmath82 ,",
    "this projector becomes : @xmath83=@xmath84 .",
    "the bloch hamiltonians @xmath35 display two upper and two lower bands separated by an insulating gap .",
    "the chern number of the projectors @xmath36 onto the lower ( and for that matter also of the upper ) bands is zero , as it will generically be for any time reversal invariant band model .",
    "according to panati s result,@xcite the fiber bundle of the occupied states is trivial , i.e. it has the simplest topological structure possible , that of @xmath85 .",
    "how can there be non - trivial topological structures ?",
    "the answer is because in the spin - hall effect the non - trivial topological structures appear only in the spin sectors , when taken separately .",
    "we now show how one can define spin up and spin down sectors even for the case when @xmath2 does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the spin operator is defined as @xmath86 the goal is to slash the fiber bundle @xmath87 into two non - trvial fiber bundles , that is to make the smooth decomposition @xmath36=@xmath88@xmath89@xmath90 for all the @xmath30 s of the brillouin torus . at the first sight",
    ", this seems a very complicated job with no clear chances of success .",
    "the key idea is to use the operator @xmath91 to do just that . indeed , after the bloch fibration , @xmath92 becomes @xmath93 and we can diagonalize each of the operators @xmath94 . as we shall see , if the rashba term does nt exceed a threshold value , the spectrum of @xmath94 consists of two isolated eigenvalues , positioned symmetrically and away from the origin , for all the @xmath30 s of the brillouin torus . the spectral projectors @xmath95 onto the negative / positive eigenvalues are smooth of @xmath30 and can be use to achieve the decomposition @xmath96 . at this point",

    "[ bc ] and define the spin - chern number as @xmath0=@xmath99@xmath100@xmath101 .",
    "this is our construction in a nutshell .",
    "we now step back and give a more general construction , without involving the brillouin torus .",
    "assume that the disorder is turned on and that we work now with the hamiltonian @xmath102=@xmath81+@xmath103 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the amplitude of the disorder is not very large so that @xmath102 still has an energy gap . let @xmath104 be the projector onto the states with energy below this gap and consider the operator @xmath105 . when the rashba term is zero , @xmath2 commutes with @xmath102 and for that reason it also commutes with @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , its spectrum consists of just two points , @xmath106 .",
    "these eigenvalues are highly degenerate .",
    "when the rashba interaction is turned on , @xmath2 and @xmath104 no longer commute , therefore the degeneracy is lifted and the eigenvalues of @xmath105 spread towards the origin . as we shall see , if the amplitude of the rashba term does not exceed a threshold value , the spectrum of @xmath105 remain confined into two isolated islands , with the origin separating them .",
    "therefore , we can define the spectral projectors onto the states with eigenvalues below the origin : @xmath107 , and above the origin : @xmath108 . to be able to define the non - commutative chern numbers",

    ", we can turn off the disorder and the rashba interaction , in which case the model eq .",

    "for this , we notice first that the projector @xmath40 in the occupied space is analytic in @xmath123 .",
    "this property is protected by the insulating gap @xmath124 of the hamiltonian @xmath102 .",
    "we then show that , at least for small @xmath123 , @xmath125 is invertible for @xmath126 in the vicinity of 0 [ here @xmath127 is the identity operator for the space @xmath122 ] .",
    "one could try to work with the expression @xmath129 and use the continuity of @xmath40 , but this expression has a problem when @xmath126=0 since @xmath130 diverges because we include the un - occupied states where @xmath121 is zero .",

    "the small factor comes from @xmath137 , which is proportional to @xmath123 . above , we used the fact that @xmath2 commutes with @xmath135 , even in the presence of disorder . in this case , the operator @xmath138 has an inverse given by the convergent series @xmath139 and we find : @xmath140 @xmath141 thus we showed that resolvent of @xmath121 is finite for @xmath126 near the origin , which excludes the existence of any eigenvalues in this region .",
    "we now show that , as long as the gaps @xmath120 and @xmath124 of @xmath121 and @xmath102 remain opened , the spectral projectors @xmath111 are exponentially localized . by exponential localization of an operator @xmath142 we mean the existence of a strictly positive @xmath49 such that @xmath143 we will use the following simple observation : if @xmath144 denotes the non - unitary transformation @xmath145 then the following is true.@xcite    * proposition 2 . * if @xmath142 is exponentially localized , then @xmath146 is a bounded operator for all orientations of @xmath147 , provided @xmath148 is smaller than @xmath49 , and conversely : if @xmath149 is bounded for any orientation of @xmath147 and @xmath150 , then @xmath142 is exponentially localized with a localization exponent equal or larger than @xmath49 .    also , it is a fact that if @xmath142 is exponentially localized , then [ @xmath151 denotes the operator norm ] @xmath152 i.e. the difference between @xmath142 and @xmath149 is small for @xmath153 small .     for small rashba coupling , of the gap @xmath120 and of the integration contours",
    "@xmath154 used in the main text.,width=302 ]    since @xmath155 it is enough to show the exponential localization of @xmath156 for all @xmath126 on the contours @xmath154 shown in fig .",
    "now the projector @xmath40 itself is exponentially localized and a general proof of this statement can be found in ref .  .",
    "then @xmath157 is bounded and we have successively : @xmath158 and @xmath159 thus @xmath160 which is strictly positive for small @xmath153 due to eq .",
    "in other words , @xmath161 is invertible , at least for small @xmath153 , which shows that all operators appearing in the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ conv ] are bounded .",
    "consequently , @xmath115 are exponentially localized .",
    "our results show that the spin - chern number is a topological invariant that is well defined in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is now clear that the robustness _ is due to the existence of two spectral gaps _ : the insulating gap of the hamiltonian and the spectral gap of the operator @xmath162 .",
    "contrary to many folkloristic believes , not all topological invariants are robust against disorder .",
    "in fact , to date , a rigorous proof for such statement exists only for the classic chern number .",
    "the proof makes heavy use of the particular expression of the chern number , thus it can not be automatically extended to other topological invariants .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that we can add the spin - chern number to the list of topological invariants that are robust to disorder .",
    "the robustness of the spin - chern number has physical consequences .",
    "we recall that , according to ref .   and , generically for dimension smaller than two , all states are exponentially localized at any strength of disorder ; for dimension greater than two , there exist extended states for low disorder and for dimension two all the states are localized except for states corresponding to isolated critical energies at which the localization length diverges . the chern number in iqhe not only has a classifying role , but its quantization in the presence of disorder implies the existence of such critical energy regions below the fermi level.@xcite the quantization of the spin - chern number leads to the same conclusion , which explains the finite spin - hall conductance in the presence of strong disorder.@xcite this remarkable property is solely related to the spin , because the spin - chern number is robust against perturbations that violate the the time reversal symmetry .",
    "indeed , none of our constructions or proofs use the inversion symmetry as an argument .",
    "the operator @xmath2 is not special .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 remain invariant to deformations of the hamiltonian _ and _ of @xmath162 , as long as the spectral gaps of the two operators remain open . closing any of the two gaps",
    "can result in jumps for the the spin - chern number .",
    "the jumps are always by an even number .",
    "the argument against the spin - chern number in refs .   and was that , using rotations in the spin sector , one can connect the hamiltonians with @xmath163 and with @xmath164 , without changing the insulating gap .",
    "but at the end of such rotation , @xmath0 changes sign and it was concluded that @xmath0 is not a well defined topological invariant . the change of sign was attributed to the closing of the gap of the hamiltonian with the spin boundary conditions .",
    "we now can give an alternative explanation : during the rotation in the spin sector , the gap of @xmath121 closes and then opens again .",
    "this problem can be easily fixed , the solution being to deform not only the hamiltonian but also the operator @xmath121 .",
    "for the case of spin rotations , this can be easily accomplished by applying the spin rotations to @xmath2 inside @xmath121 . if there is such easy fix , then the old question resurfaces : does the spin - chern number contain more information than the @xmath1 invariant ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "after the continuous rotation mentioned above , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "thus , there is no canonical way to chose the projectorss @xmath111 and , since this choice determines the sign of @xmath0 , the sign contains no additional information .",
    "the construction can be easily generalized . for more complex insulators",
    ", it is very probable that one can replace @xmath2 by other non - trivial operators @xmath167 by combining spin and/or point group symmetry operators .",
    "using such operators one might discover nontrivial topological structures in seemingly trivial insulators .",
    "for example , it was recently pointed out @xcite that certain surface states in ordinary semiconductors can have topological origins . the non - zero chern numbers for the spectral sectors of @xmath168",
    "will then lead to a @xmath167-hall effect . for other models",
    ", we can find operators @xmath168 that have @xmath169 islands of isolated spectrum with exponentially localized projectors .",
    "if @xmath167 commutes with the translations of the unit cell , we can define a chern number for each spectral island of @xmath168 . a simple example of this type is the model of eq .  [ model ] with spin @xmath170 particles . for @xmath123=0 ,",
    "@xmath2 commutes with the hamiltonian and @xmath39 splits into four sectors , corresponding to @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath170 .",
    "turning on the disorder will not affect these eigenvalues .",
    "for each sector we can define a cern number , which take the values ( assuming @xmath117 ) : @xmath174 and @xmath175 . when the rashba interaction is turned on , the spectrum of @xmath162 spreads , but is still contained into four isolated spectral islands .",
    "thus , we can still split @xmath39 into four sectors and our analysis shows that the chern numbers for each sectors will be conserved as long as the the insulating gap remains open and the spectral islands of @xmath162 remain isolated .",
    "the spin - chern number can be defined in various ways , depending how we group the sectors .",
    "if we repeat the construction for spin @xmath173 and put the negative @xmath176 sectors into @xmath177 and the positive @xmath176 sectors into @xmath178 , @xmath0 becomes 2 .",
    "other possible groupings gives @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the existence of the nontrivial chern numbers for different sectors does not automatically imply the existence of chiral edge modes .",
    "generically , only the insulators with odd @xmath0 display such edge modes.@xcite the discussion given here hardly touches the problem of classification and of the edge modes .",
    "for these two problems , one has to explore how the occupied states relate ( connect ) to the un - occupied states .",
    "this has to be done on solvable models .",
    "it is at this point where our analysis becomes relevant because now we have a guiding principle which tells when the realistic models , which should include disorder and will generally not be solvable , can be deformed into smooth solvable models without changing the topological invariants .",
    "the robustness of the edge modes was also recently investigated in ref .  , which introduced a quantized edge index .",
    "although this edge index was also constructed via a splitting , the connection between the edge index and @xmath0 is not clear to us at this moment .",
    "we want to make a final remark about the edge modes .",
    "the existence of nontrivial topological sectors can indicate reach edge and surface physics .",
    "for example , for the model of spin @xmath170 particles , when cutting an edge we can be sure that four [ which become 2 ] edge bands shoot out of the bulk spectrum .",
    "the bands hybridize and return back into the same part of the bulk spectrum were they originated .",
    "nevertheless , these bands lead to [ gapped ] edge states , which can still be useful for practical applications . in the presence of disorder",
    ", these edge bands will localize , but if the localization length is large , these edge states , for example , can efficiently trap light and thus be useful in photovoltaic devices .",
    "we have demonstrated that the spin - chern number can be defined in the thermodynamic limit without the need of any boundary conditions , therefore showing that the spin - chern number describes the bulk and not the edges as it is currently believed . by making a connection with the non - commutative theory of chern number",
    ", we were able to demonstrate the robustness of the spin - chern number against disorder and smooth deformations of the models .",
    "the robustness , which is solely related to the spin and has nothing to do with the time reversal symmetry , has physical consequences : it implies the existence of critical energies below the fermi level where the localization length diverges . we have also theorized possible generalizations of our construction , which could aid the search and discovery of new topological phases"

    "<S> on one hand the original paper by sheng and collaborators revealed robust properties of @xmath0 against disorder and certain deformations of the model and , on the other hand , several people pointed out that @xmath0 can change sign under special deformations that keep the bulk hamiltonian gap open . because of the later findings , the spin - chern number was dismissed as a true bulk topological invariant and now is viewed as something that describes the edge where the spin boundary conditions are imposed . in this paper , we define the spin - chern number directly in the thermodynamic limit , without using any boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate its quantization in the presence of strong disorder and we argue that @xmath0 is a true bulk topological invariant whose robustness against disorder and smooth deformations of the hamiltonian have important physical consequences . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the spin - chern number remain valid even when the time reversal invariance is broken .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum spin - hall insulators represent a new state of matter . </S>",
    "<S> they were predicted theoretically in ref .   and </S>",
    "<S> soon after that they were found experimentally.@xcite samples made of such materials display dissipationless spin currents at the edges , that are robust against continuous deformations and disorder.@xcite    the existence of the edge channels is due to the nontrivial topology of the bulk energy bands and two nontrivial topological invariants were proposed to describe this topology , virtually in the same time : the @xmath1 invariant proposed by kane and mele @xcite and the spin - chern number proposed by sheng and collaborators @xcite ( first mentioned in ref .  ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the later invariant , which came under sustained scrutiny because it promised a finer classification of the spin - hall insulators . </S>",
    "<S> this was later argued not to be the case.@xcite    the spin - chern number was computed by integrating the berry curvature generated by imposing twisted boundary conditions on a finite sample . the numerical evidence given in ref </S>",
    "<S> .   implied that @xmath0 is a robust topological invariant . </S>",
    "<S> it was later observed , however , that one can continuously deform the model using spin rotations that keep the hamiltonian s gap unchanged but switch the sign of the spin - chern number.@xcite this argument shows that sometime the structure proposed in ref </S>",
    "<S> .   fails to be a smooth fiber bundle and that @xmath0 may not be well defined over the entire spin - hall zone of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the current understanding is that , whenever one crosses certain zones of the parameter space , @xmath0 jumps , but these jumps are always by an even number . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can still use @xmath0 to formulate a @xmath1 classification of the spin - hall insulators and to efficiently compute the @xmath1 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the interest in the spin - chern number continues to be strong . </S>",
    "<S> for example , an efficient algorithm for numerical evaluations of @xmath0 was proposed by fukui and hatsugai,@xcite and later the algorithm was used to map @xmath0 for aperiodic systems.@xcite but other works totally dismiss the spin - chern number.@xcite for example ref .   </S>",
    "<S> states that @xmath0 loses its meaning when the spin is not conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we re - define the spin - chern number , this time directly for an infinite sample and without involving any boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this shows , univocally , that @xmath0 is a topological invariant describing the bulk and not some edge as previous works implied . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> , the spin - chern number is defined as the half difference between the chern numbers for the spin up and spin down sectors of the occupied space . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the spin up / down sectors can be rigorously defined even when @xmath2 is not conserved .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we state some very general results from the non - commuative theory of the chern number@xcite and then we show how to apply these results to demonstrate the quantization of the spin - chern number in the presence of strong disorder . </S>",
    "<S> several physical consequences emerge from this analysis like the existence of critical energies below the fermi level where the localization length diverges . unlike the @xmath1 invariant , </S>",
    "<S> the robust properties of the spin - chern number remain unchanged when the time reversal symmetry is broken . </S>"
