    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a spectacularly successful theory that stands as one of the truly great scientific achievements . despite this success , however , the theory possesses a number of short - comings , suggesting it will likely require extensions and/or modifications in the future .",
    "the most obvious motivation for extending the sm is the need to incorporate gravity .",
    "however , a lack of present - day experimental guidance makes the pursuit of the theory of quantum gravity an incredibly challenging task .",
    "additional evidence that the sm is incomplete comes from the experimental observation of neutrino mixing and the need to explain the missing gravitating ( i.e.  dark ) matter , required on galactic scales .",
    "these puzzles motivate the addition of new particle species to the sm and there is much hope that such new species will manifest in future experiments ( in particular at run ii of the lhc ) .",
    "the neutrino mass and dark matter ( dm ) problems have stimulated much research and there are multiple candidate solutions one can pursue .",
    "the problems may have independent solutions , though it seems reasonable to ask whether the two puzzles could share a unified or common solution .",
    "could the neutrino mass and dm problems be related ?    in 2002 , krauss , nasri and trodden ( knt ) proposed a simple extension of the sm model that admits a relationship between the existence of dm and the origin of neutrino mass  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one adds new fields to the sm , such that neutrino mass is generated radiatively at the three - loop level , with one of the particles propagating in the mass diagram being a dm candidate .",
    "the model employs two charged singlet scalars , @xmath8 , and three generations of gauge - singlet fermions @xmath9 . a @xmath10 symmetry with action @xmath11 is also imposed .",
    "this ensures stability of the lightest fermion @xmath9 , thereby giving a dm candidate , and also prevents a coupling between sm neutrinos and @xmath9 , which would otherwise generate tree - level neutrino masses .",
    "the result is a type of unified description for the origin of neutrino mass and dm , with the removal of the dm candidate simultaneously turning off neutrino mass .    in recent years",
    ", a number of basic generalizations of the knt model have appeared . in one such model ( hereafter ` the triplet model ' ) , the singlet fields @xmath12 and @xmath9 are replaced by @xmath13 triplets  ahriche:2014cda .",
    "this model retains the @xmath10 symmetry to ensure dm stability and prevent tree - level neutrino masses , and gives a viable alternative unified framework for the dm and neutrino mass problems .",
    "a further generalization exchanges the singlet fields @xmath12 and @xmath9 for @xmath13 quintuplet fields  @xcite .",
    "this model ( hereafter ` the quintuplet model ' ) does not require the @xmath10 symmetry in order to prevent tree - level neutrino masses , and is a viable theory for radiative neutrino mass , independent of dm considerations .",
    "interestingly , the most - general lagrangian for the model contains a single @xmath10-breaking coupling @xmath14 .",
    "when taken small , @xmath15 , the model gives a long - lived dm candidate , while turning @xmath14 off completely , @xmath16 , activates a @xmath10 symmetry and gives absolutely stable dm .",
    "thus , the quintuplet model is a viable model of radiative neutrino mass , with or without dm .    due to the presence of larger multiplets with non - trivial @xmath17 charges in both the triplet and quintuplet models ,",
    "the phenomenology of the models is rather rich . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the analysis of refs .",
    "ahriche:2014cda , ahriche:2014oda and undertake a more extensive study of the phenomenology of both models .",
    "we investigate the effect of the triplet and quintuplet scalars on both the higgs mass and the triple higgs coupling , showing that the latter can experience sizable modifications .",
    "we also study the effect of the new multiplets on the higgs decay channels @xmath18 .",
    "our work shows that , e.g.  observable changes are expected to @xmath19 , with some regions of parameter space already excluded for the triplet model .",
    "the effect of the enlarged scalar sector on the electroweak phase transition is also analyzed , revealing a tendency for a strongly first - order phase transition in large regions of parameter space .    before proceeding we note that further generalizations of the knt model are possible .",
    "@xcite presented colored generalizations and other related three - loop models that employ slightly modified loop topologies .",
    "a septuplet generalization of the knt model was proposed in ref .",
    "this had the interesting feature of automatically containing an absolutely stable dm candidate , without requiring a new symmetry .",
    "a minimal scale - invariant implementation was also recently studied  @xcite .",
