    "ferromagnetism is a quantum phenomenon which arises from the long range ordering of interacting magnetic moments in a solid .",
    "the richness of magnetic properties in solids is due to hybridization of @xmath7- and @xmath8-orbitals which is decisive for magnetic moment formation and the way individual moments interact with each other in the solid .",
    "this is one of the reasons why magnetic semiconductors or diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are traditionally conceived as semiconducting materials with transition metal ions as dopant .",
    "numerous studies of dms , both experimental and theoretical ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) have come up with varying conclusions . in zno , substituting the cation by an isovalent transition metal , e.g. cobalt , introduces magnetic moments , but in itself does not lead to ferromagnetic coupling between these moments  @xcite .",
    "hence , complex strategies , for instance co - doping , and elaborate growth techniques seem to be necessary to fabricate a dms based on zno as host material .",
    "recently there are reports on magnetism in semiconducting materials without any @xmath7- or @xmath8-elements  @xcite .",
    "this is commonly known as @xmath3-magnetism and discussed for different classes of materials , starting from pure carbon based materials like graphite , graphene , and non - metallic nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the common feature in this class of materials is that magnetism involves the 2@xmath9 orbitals .",
    "the origin of magnetic moment is attributed to incomplete cancellation of majority and minority spin electronic contribution due to the hund s type exchange .",
    "magnetic moments have been reported for almost all ionic semiconductors in the presence of intrinsic defects , such as cation vacancies , or in the presence of impurities related to anion substitution . in the following we discuss reports of magnetism in semiconductors with impurities at the anion site .",
    "the formation of a localized magnetic moment , which is a pre - requisite for @xmath3-magnetism , depends on the relative strength of electronegativity between the dopant element and the anion of the host semiconductor .",
    "if the bond between the dopant and the cation is weaker than the native bond of the semiconductor , this leads to localized atomic - like 2@xmath9 orbitals of the dopant and a stable spin - polarized state .",
    "on the other hand , if the strength of the bond is stronger than the native bond of the semiconductor , this will cause delocalization of the dopant @xmath10 orbitals due to strong hybridization with the cations .",
    "consequently , there is reduced or vanishing spin - polarization in the system  @xcite .",
    "hence , substituting the anion site by an element with smaller electronegativity can introduce spin - polarized states in the gap which can then mediate the magnetic interaction through the double - exchange mechanism as discussed by mavropoulos _",

    "here we focus on the magnetic properties of zno with carbon as substitutional impurity ( on the zinc site denoted by c@xmath0 , and on the oxygen site denoted by c@xmath1 ) studied with the help of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in the next section we present technical details of our dft calculations .",

    "finally , we conclude on the possible connection between c impurities and the ferromagnetism in zno found in experiments .",
    "electronic structure calculations are performed using the plane - wave pseudopotential dft method as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite . for studying a substitutional impurity in zno ,",
    "the system is modeled as a supercell consisting of periodic repetitions of the primitive wurtzite cell .",
    "since we use different sizes of supercells , we stick to a particular nomenclature in our discussions .",
    "we refer to the size of the supercell with periodic extention @xmath14 as  s@xmath15 \" .",
    "the electronic structure of homogeneously distributed impurites has been studied with the relatively small supercell s222 , see fig .",
    "1(c ) , while to study impurity pairs in zno we employ two kinds of large supercells , namely s622 and s226 ( fig .",
    "1(d ) and ( e ) , respectively .",
    "this is necessary as the wurtzite crystal structure is non - centrosymmetric and the bond lengths are different along the hexagonal plane and along the @xmath5-direction .",
    "essentially , s622 intends to scan the interactions along the hexagonal plane of the lattice and the s226 scans the interaction along the @xmath5-axis of the lattice .",
    "the calculations have been performed using a plane - wave energy cutoff of 400 ev .",
    "we have used the generalized gradient approximation  ( gga ) with the pw91 parameterization  @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential and the ion - electron interactions are treated with the projector - augmented wave  ( paw ) method  @xcite .",
    "the lattice constants of the primitive lattice of zno is taken to be @xmath16 = 3.29  , @xmath17 = 1.606 and the relative shift of zn and o planes , @xmath18  =  0.380 , which were found to be the minimum energy lattice parameters in the gga calculations  @xcite .",
    "the doped supercell configuration is relaxed to avoid any strain until the structural energy is converged to @xmath19 ev . at this level of tolerance ,",
    "the forces in the system are found to be below @xmath20 .",
    "the relaxation is performed with a @xmath21-centered monkhorst - pack @xmath22-points grid of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for supercells s622 and s226 , respectively .",
    "part of these results have been cross - checked with the full - potential local orbital ( fplo ) minimum - basis code , which uses localized basis sets  @xcite .",
    "dft within gga gives reliable structural parameters for zno but has limitation in predicting the right optical band gap , which is with a value of 0.69 ev grossly underestimated in comparison to the experimental value of 3.4 ev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the localization of zn @xmath7-bands is not properly described by gga because the hybridization of zn @xmath7 and o @xmath9 bands is overestimated .",
    "thus , the zn @xmath7 bands are located almost 3 ev too close to the fermi level as compared to experimental observation  @xcite . one way to overcome",
    "the problem is through the introduction of hybrid functionals where the electronic exchange potential is mixed with some percentage of hartree - fock exchange , while the electronic correlation potential is entirely taken from the gga . we have employed the screened hybrid - functionals to ascertain the electronic structure of a single impurity .",
    "the hybrid - functionals are of the type suggested by heyd , scuseria and ernzerhof  @xcite , with the the exact ( hartree - fock ) exchange and the gga exchange in the ratio 1:3  @xcite .",
    "we have used the hse06 functional for our studies  @xcite .",
    "the stability of an impurity configuration can be judged from its formation energy .",
    "since substitution changes the number of atomic species , the formation energy must be calculated with reference to thermodynamic reservoirs characterized by their chemical potentials . in practice ,",
    "the values of these chemical potentials reflect the experimental conditions during sample preparation .",
    "the formation energy , e@xmath25 , is thus defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total energy of the supercell with impurity , @xmath28 is the energy of pure zno host with the equivalent number of stoichiometric zno units , @xmath29 is the chemical potential of a species and @xmath30 is the change of number of the corresponding species in the supercell . in thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk zno , the condition @xmath31 must always be satisfied .",
    "this leaves us with just one unknown , which we choose to be @xmath32 .",
    "however , an interval for the values of @xmath32 corresponding to physically meaningful growth conditions can be provided : the upper bound of the chemical potential , corresponding to o - rich growth conditions , is taken from the oxygen molecule , @xmath33 .",

    "[ phaseplot ] , the formation energies which we obtain for c@xmath6 and c@xmath12 impurities are plotted as a function of oxygen chemical potential .",
    "our formation energies suggest that c@xmath1 and c@xmath0 impurities are energetically favorable only under carbon - rich conditions ( negative values in the formation energy ) . also , the formation energy of c@xmath0 is smaller than the formation energy of c@xmath1 in all chemical environments .",
    "we find that the formation of c@xmath6 is energetically favorable only in a narrow range of @xmath32 shown as the thick ( blue ) vertical line .",
    "this tiny region corresponds to an equilibrium with metallic zinc , i.e. , extremely o - poor conditions . hence stabilizing the c@xmath6 defect in zno is difficult under common experimental growth conditions of high oxygen pressure where @xmath32 approaches the value corresponding to molecular oxygen .",
    "a single c@xmath6 in a zno supercell leads to a spin - polarized solution with an integral magnetic moment of 2@xmath39/c as discussed in the literature previously  @xcite .",
    "the spin polarized solution is lower in energy than the non - spin polarized one by a difference of 0.215 ev .",

    "[ fig : chgplot ] .",
    "one finds that the effective spin density is centered on the c atom and extends to the nearest neighbor zn atoms and the next - nearest neighbor o atoms with a total magnetic moment of 2@xmath39/c .",
    "we note that the hse06 functional gives a large exchange splitting of the impurity states and larger band gap for zno than gga , and the impurity states introduced by c@xmath6 which mainly consist of carbon states are deep in the gap when measured from the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to use c@xmath6 as an acceptor that could introduce hole states for thermally activated p - type conductivity in zno . on the other hand ,",
    "the more stable c@xmath12 impurity acts as a donor and does not lead to any spin polarization , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss possible compensation effects that could alter the magnetic properties of c@xmath6 . using dft studies , li  _ et  al .",
    "_ have shown that the presence of oxygen vacancy ( v@xmath6 ) quenches the spin - polarization from c@xmath6 in zno  @xcite .",
    "comparing the formation energy of neutral defects  @xcite , we conclude that both , v@xmath6 and v@xmath12 , have positive formation energy , with the formation energy of v@xmath6 being lower than the formation energy of v@xmath12 in o - poor conditions ( favorable conditions for c@xmath6 as seen above ) .",
    "hence , the role of defects like v@xmath12 and v@xmath6 can be safely ruled out in contributing to magnetism in the material .",
    "however , the magnetic moment of c@xmath6 can be quenched by h impurities in zno that act as donor .",
    "we have tested co - doping of h and c in s622 and find that the electron from h compensates one bohr magneton of magnetic moment . upon adding two h in the supercell , the magnetic moment",
    "is completely quenched to zero .",
    "this observation is independent of the distance of the hydrogen from the carbon site in the supercell . in experiments",
    "the hydrogen concentration during zno synthesis is difficult to control .",
    "it has been found that the energy barrier for the escape of h through the zno surface can be as large as 0.58  ev  @xcite .",

    "in order to investigate impurity interactions at various concentrations , we perform dft calculations with both vasp and fplo using a single c@xmath6 impurity in the different supercells shown in fig .",

    "these cells correspond to carbon concentrations of 12.5% ( for both s122 and s221 ) and 6.25% ( s222 ) . with decreasing the c concentration from to 12.5% and 6.25% ,",
    "the interaction between impurities becomes weaker and the impurity band becomes narrower . even though the supercells s221 and",
    "s122 have the same doping concentration of 12.5% , they do not lead to equivalent electronic structure because of the anisotropy of the wurtzite crystal . from table",
    "[ tab : supercellsinfo ] , we note that the magnetic moment of s122 is a fractional value in units of @xmath13 , an indication of strong hybridization between the c 2@xmath9 orbitals and the valence band , leading to metallic behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ supercells_dos](a ) . however , the magnetic moment of s221 and s222 is integer ( 2 @xmath13 ) , i.e. , the system is a magnetic half metal ( see fig .",
    "[ supercells_dos ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "we carried out fixed - spin - moment  ( fsm ) calculations to test the stability and characteristics of the spin - polarized solutions itself .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ supercells_fsm1 ] shows the magnetic polarization energy of the supercells shown in fig .",
    "[ four_supercells ] ( a ) to ( c ) .",
    "here the magnetic polarization energy is defined as the energy of the system at a given fixed magnetic moment ( @xmath49 ) relative to the energy of non - magnetic solutions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "when a spin - polarized solution is favored , then the magnetic polarization energy takes negative values . for metallic systems ( supercell s122 ) , the minimum magnetic polarization energies are found at non - integer values of @xmath49 as shown in table  [ tab : supercellsinfo ] , and the magnetic polarization energies show a smooth parabolic change around the minima . for supercells",
    "s221 and s222 the minimum magnetic polarization energy is obtained at an integer value @xmath49 = 2 @xmath51 and the energy has a cusp at the minima which correspond to localized impurity band in the gap .",
    "thus , from the fsm calculations we verify the stability and characteristics of spin - polarized solutions in the supercells and one can estimate an upper bound of c concentration for the material to be a semiconductor rather than a metal .",
    "a higher c concentration leads to a metallic solution , i.e.  the impurity band hybridizes with the valence band of zno .",
    "according to the gga results , the distance between c impurities should be larger than twice the lattice constant , meaning that the c concentration should be lower than 6% , to avoid such a metallic state .",
    "the precise estimate of this concentration might depend on the exchange - correlation functional used in the calculations .",
    "as we discussed above , hybrid - functionals predict the impurity bands to lie further up in the gap .",
    "consequently , zno may tolerate an even larger c concentration before becoming metallic than the values we have estimated from gga .      next , we study the magnetic interaction between the carbon impurities as a function of their separation .",
    "we employ the relatively large supercells s622 and s226  ( fig .  [",
    "four_supercells ]  d and e ) to include long - range interactions .",
    "the concentration of carbon in these supercells is 4.17% which is within the range of experimental impurity concentrations  @xcite .",
    "as long as the carbon impurities are well - separated ( maximum separation of 16   in @xmath5-direction and 11   in @xmath4-direction for s226 and s622 , respectively ) , each impurity retains its magnetic moment of @xmath52 independent of the distance .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to map the interaction between two c@xmath1 impurities onto an effective ising hamiltonian @xmath53 the index @xmath54 runs over the nearest neighbor sites appropriately taking into account the periodic boundary conditions used in the dft calculations . without loss of generality we can choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 to calculate the individual interaction . for a given geometry @xmath57 , the @xmath58 can now be accessed from the total energy difference between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignment of the moments of c@xmath1 impurities .",
    "these @xmath58 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ jij-226 - 622 ] . as a guide to the eye",
    ", we include a shaded area bounded by two exponentially decaying functions within which all the interactions are contained .",
    "we note that the @xmath58 are positive in the whole range , i.e. the spin interaction between c@xmath1 is ferromagnetic in the host material .",
    "averagely , the @xmath58 decrease with increasing separation @xmath59 between the impurities while there is a large spread in the data for small distances .",
    "we categorize the geometric configuration of the impurities using the crystallographic direction and select those configurations that have the major component of their distance vectors in the hexagonal plane ( @xmath4-direction ) . the selected configurations ( a1 , a3 , a4 , a6 and a12 ) are shown as filled symbols in fig .  [ jij-226 - 622 ] .",
    "we observe a strongly anisotropic behavior of @xmath58 ; the filled symbols are located in the upper part of the shaded area , whereas the open symbols are in the lower part .",
    "test calculations performed for some configurations with the gga+@xmath40 method have confirmed the ferromagnetic nature of the interactions and indicate that the results are independent of the exact energetic position of the minority - spin c 2@xmath9-states within the host band gap .    since the carbon impurity levels lie deep inside the band gap ( see the dos in fig .",
    "[ fig : dosplot ]  ( d ) ) , the magnetic interactions can not be mediated by carriers in the valence or conduction bands of the host material ( as typical for small - gap dms materials ) .",
    "instead , ferromagnetism arises from partly filled impurity bands , as in zener s double - exchange model  @xcite .",
    "according to this model , ferromagnetic ordering becomes stabilized because it allows for a lowering of the kinetic energy of the electrons in the impurity band : due to the overlap of impurity orbitals of the same spin , the dispersion of the impurity bands is increased , and the kinetic energy of electrons occupying the lower part of these bands is decreased . obviously , this energy gain is largest for interactions along those crystallographic directions where the impurity band crosses the fermi level .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the magnetic interaction can therefore be explained from the band structure of c@xmath6 in zno . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ jij-226 - 622 ] , the band structure of the minority spin states of c@xmath1 in s333 is shown .",
    "since the spin - majority impurity bands are completely filled and thus can not give rise to any energy gain , only the minority - spin bands can be responsible for the magnetic interactions .",
    "we find that the carbon bands are crossing the fermi level mostly along the hexagonal @xmath4-plane , i.e. , along the a ",
    "l , @xmath21m , a  h and @xmath21k directions , while along the @xmath5-axis ( m  l , @xmath21a and k  h ) the fermi energy lies in the gap between the occupied and the unoccupied bands .",
    "therefore , the ferromagnetic interaction is mediated more effectively within the hexagonal @xmath4-plane , giving rise to anisotropic ferromagnetism .",
    "we note that the ferromagnetic interaction is rather short ranged ( below 10   ) .",
    "ferromagnetism at finite temperatures can thus only be expected at a carbon concentration larger than 2% ( refer to the scale of the c concentration in the upper axis of fig .",
    "[ jij-226 - 622 ] ) .",
    "together with the estimate given in section  [ iiib ] , which gives the upper bound for c concentration to avoid metallic state , we conclude that a c@xmath1 concentration between 2% and 6% should be optimal to obtain ferromagnetism due to homogeneously distributed impurities .",
    "moreover , we note that c impurities have a tendency to cluster which poses an upper limit to the useful concentration .",
    "as pointed out in previous work  @xcite , the c impurities tend to form energetically more stable c@xmath60 molecules . in this case , the @xmath61 orbital of the c@xmath60 molecule resonates with the conduction band of zno which may lead to ferromagnetism mediated by the host material in n - type zno .",
    "thus , this mechanism differs from the ferromagnetic interaction between c@xmath1 impurities described in the present work which originates from conductivity due to impurity bands , and is hence independent of host carriers .",
    "we have studied the two possible substitutional carbon impurities in zno ( c@xmath6 and c@xmath12 ) and find that c@xmath12 is energetically more favorable than c@xmath6 .",
    "however , c@xmath6 can be stabilized under specific ( o - poor and c - rich ) growth conditions .",
    "this type of environment is uncommon in usual zno growth , but could be generated by oxidizing metallic zinc in the presence of an atomic carbon source . given that a material with a c@xmath6 concentration of 26% can be realized , this would be an interesting prototypical system for @xmath3 magnetism : our dft calculations indicate that c@xmath6 in this range of concentrations is associated with a localized magnetic moment of 2  @xmath62 .",
    "partially filled impurity bands in the minority spin channel mediate ferromagnetic interaction between the c@xmath6 impurities .",
