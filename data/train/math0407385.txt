    "it is a usual practice to compare harmonicity with holomorphy in any context where they are simultaneously defined . in the classical case of real and complex valued mappings defined on open subsets of @xmath0 ,",
    "the dictionary is realized , locally , by means of the notion of conjugate part .    in the general case of hermitian complex manifolds , since one notion is metric , and the other is differentiable , the comparison is available , only if some compatibility between the metric and the complex structure is fulfilled .",
    "roughly speaking this corresponds to the kaehler property .",
    "classically , harmonic functions are defined by means of a metric on a riemannian manifold . however , there is larger class of spaces where one can talk about them .",
    "a substantial class is that of ( measurable ) spaces endowed with markov processes .",
    "as particular interesting cases , we have random walks on groups , and graphs endowed with their natural `` simplicial '' markov chains .",
    "recall here that for a function @xmath1 , its laplacian @xmath2 is the function : @xmath3 where @xmath4 means @xmath5 is adjacent to @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the valency of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath8 in this paper , we will always deal with complex valued functions @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is _ a riemannian manifold _ or _ a graph_.      even in the most classical case ,",
    "there are some and in fact deep differences between harmonicity and holomorphy .",
    "maybe , the silliest one is that the ( usual ) product of two holomorphic functions is holomorphic , but this is not the case of harmonic functions !    this suggests to define holomorphic functions just by forcing invariance under multiplication :    [ definition.holomorphic ]    let @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a riemannian manifold or a graph .",
    "we say that @xmath11 is holomorphic if both @xmath11 and its square @xmath12 are harmonic .",
    "recall the classical formula for functions on riemannian manifolds : @xmath13 ( it is remarkable that this is also valid in the case of graphs , for a natural definition of the gradient @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is holomorphic in the sense of the definition above , iff , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this exactly means that @xmath11 is conformal , or to use a more precise terminology , it is _ semi - conformal _ which means that @xmath11 may have singular points ( i.e. where @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath8 a mapping @xmath22 is holomorphic , according with our definition , iff @xmath11 is holomorphic or anti - holomorphic , in the usual sense .",
    "actually , an individual anti - holomorphic mapping ( on any complex manifold ) can be restored to become holomorphic . however , when considering all holomorphic and anti - holomorphic mappings together , it is a nuisance to separate them .",
    "indeed that is exactly the counterpart of non - linearity in the equation @xmath23 . in the general case unlike that of complex manifolds ,",
    "this does not split into two linear equations corresponding to holomorphy and anti - holomorphy .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we will keep our term `` holomorphic '' as it is defined , since in fact , we will always deal with individual functions .",
    "@xmath8 in the classical case of a mapping @xmath22 , conformality of @xmath11 , implies conformality and hence harmonicity for all powers @xmath24 , for all integer @xmath25 , that is , for all @xmath25 , the equation @xmath26 is satisfied ( this has an obvious meaning for @xmath27 ) .",
    "more generally :    [ quadratic ] @xmath21    @xmath8 for any riemannian manifold @xmath10 , we have , @xmath28    that is , a holomorphic function satisfies all @xmath29 for any @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath8 for any @xmath30 , there is a graph @xmath10 and a holomorphic function on it , which satisfies @xmath29 but which does not satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath8 for a graph @xmath10 , of finite valency , there is a finite @xmath32 , such that any function satisfying @xmath33 is constant ( and hence satisfies trivially @xmath34 ) .",
    "consider the simplest dirichlet problem for _ bounded _ harmonic functions defined on the unit disc @xmath35 of @xmath0 .",
    "classical harmonic analysis theory allows one to define a boundary value isomorphism : @xmath36 from the hardy space of bounded harmonic functions on the disc , to the space of bounded measurable functions on the circle .",
    "the hardy space @xmath37 of holomorphic ( in the usual sense ) bounded functions , is a part of @xmath38 , but its image in @xmath39 by the boundary value mapping , is very hard to explicit .",
    "in analytic words , this certainly reduces to an invariance by hilbert transform , but this can not help in understanding how holomorphic functions are more `` regular '' than harmonic ones .",
    "it is singularly suggesting to bring out a criterion , ensuring that a function @xmath40 is the boundary value of a holomorphic function !",
    "therefore , our motivation from the dirichlet problem viewpoint , is that we are introducing here an `` abstract '' notion of holomorphy , which may help to understand the true nature of holomorphic functions . on the other hand , this notion of holomorphy for functions on @xmath10 , allows one to specify a class of bounded measurable functions on its poisson boundary , which are more regular than the others .",
    "actually , one can take any ring @xmath41 , and consider @xmath41-valued functions defined on @xmath10 .",
    "in the case of graphs , it is meaningful to speak of harmonicity . as for riemannian manifolds ,",
    "one just needs the ring to be topological , since the laplacian can be defined via its infinitesimal mean value property .",
    "let @xmath10 be a riemannian manifold or a graph , and @xmath41 a topological ring .",
    "a mapping @xmath42 is called @xmath41-holomorphic , iff @xmath11 and @xmath12 are harmonic .",
    "we have just rewritten the same definition given in the case @xmath43 . our goal is to point out some examples that seem exciting , and deserve attention .",
    "we mention here the case when @xmath41 is , the quaternionic field ( over the reals ) , and the matrix algebras @xmath44 or @xmath45 ...",
    "_ as an example , in another direction , consider the dalembertian operator on @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "see the second @xmath46 as a ring ( in fact an @xmath49-algebra ) which is the product of @xmath49 by itself .",
    "suppose @xmath11 is a solution of @xmath50 .",
    "it then follows , essentially ( up to a switch of factors ... ) , that @xmath51 .",
    "this means that @xmath11 is a conformal mapping of the minkowski space @xmath52 .",
    "_    _ the previous example suggests to define a wave equation on graphs .",
    "recall at this stage , that more generally than the canonical markov chain on a graph , there are markov chains with arbitrary non - equiprobable transition functions , or equivalently , the graph has weighted edges .",
    "this is also equivalent to endow the graph with an adapted metric , which is just given by these weights .",
    "_    now , the idea is to allow weights to take negative values .",
    "analogously to the term `` pseudo - riemannian '' , one may call such graphs `` pseudo - metric '' as a diffusion operator , one obtains something like a dalembertian , with more complicated properties .",
    "they seem well adapted and connected to the dynamics on the graph .",
    "it is particularly interesting to define , amongst pseudo - metric graphs , a notion of lorentzian ones : there is only one negative direction which corresponds to the `` time '' .",
    "the discussion above corresponds essentially to our chronological motivation in bringing out this notion of holomorphy .",
    "we then looked for possible correlated notions in the geometric literature .",
    "it was difficult to conclude if we were nt , hopefully , intuitively guided to harmonic morphisms .",
    "after , having a look on this wide theme , we discovered that our holomorphic functions on riemannian manifolds , are nothing but harmonic morphisms with values in @xmath46 .",
    "this is however obscure , and not clear to extract , even , in standard celebrated references in this theory . in any case ,",
    "motivation of harmonic morphisms are never stated as ours here . on the other hand , in the discrete case , that is for graphs , a theory of harmonic morphisms",
    "is not yet completely established .",
    "maybe , the problem comes from the choice , to see riemannian manifolds and graphs as objects of the same category or not .",
    "anyway , let s anticipate and say that our holomorphic functions can not be seen as harmonic morphisms from graphs to @xmath46 .",
    "recall that for riemannian manifolds , a harmonic morphism is a mapping which preserves sheaves of local harmonic real functions . in other words , @xmath53 is a harmonic morphism , if for any real harmonic function @xmath1 defined on an open subset of @xmath54 , @xmath55 is harmonic .      obviously in this definition",
    ", one can let @xmath10 and @xmath54 , to be , both , or just one among then , a graph ( instead of a riemannian manifold ) .",
    "in particular , one can speak of harmonic morphisms @xmath56 , where @xmath10 is a graph .",
    "harmonic morphisms in the discrete case do not behave as nicely as in the classical case .",
    "here is one difference between the two situations , with respect to our notions of holomorphy .",
    "[ non.quadratic ] let @xmath9 be a mapping .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath8 if @xmath10 is a riemannian manifold , then @xmath11 is holomorphic , iff , @xmath11 is a harmonic morphism .",
    "@xmath8 there is a graph @xmath10 having a holomorphic function @xmath9 which is not a harmonic morphism .",
    "in fact , a non - constant harmonic morphism is an open mapping ( see  [ proof.riemannan ] ) . in particular",
    "a harmonic morphism from a 1-dimensional objet ( for instance a graph ) to @xmath0 is constant .",
    "the second part of the theorem above means that there are non - constant holomorphic functions on some graphs .",
    "our first aim is to introduce this point of view of holomorphy , which we find sufficiently motivated as we said above , and it is at least amusing !",
    "this point of view is obscure in the literature related to harmonic morphisms . for example , ( a ) jacobi s problem , a precursor problem in the theory , since it exactly asks for a classification of global harmonic morphisms @xmath57 , is expressed as a partial differential equation , but different from our formulation of holomorphic mappings ( from @xmath58 ) .",
    "this problem was solved only recently @xcite .",
    "other more `` elementary '' proofs were obtained afterwards ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipate here to announce our `` elementary '' proof which will appear in a forthcoming paper .    also , as a contribution of the paper is the fact that the concept of holomorphy in the discrete case seems to be new .",
    "we were convinced of this for a long time , and after parts of the present paper were written , we discovered ( in special circumstances ) that the terminology `` discrete holomorphy '' was already used . indeed in @xcite ( and related papers ) the author introduced a notion of holomorphy for forms and functions on graphs .",
    "inspired by hodge theory , the definition is global , and linear .",
    "it is therefore different from our notion , yet , possible analogies are interesting to find .      instead of a systematic study of discrete holomorphy in the present article",
    ", we focus on some particular examples which illustrate various subtleties",
    ".    we will give some attention to the simplest non - trivial cases : the 3-valenced tree @xmath59 and its ( 1-dimensional ) `` dual graph '' @xmath60 ( see  [ tr3 ] ) .",
    "the spaces of holomorphic functions have finite dimension ( which is of course not the case of harmonic functions ) , and endowed with the beautiful action of the automorphism group .",
    "in fact , holomorphic functions are `` essentially '' determined when given on some finite subsets of vertices .",
    "there is a `` holomorphic dynamics '' which allows one to calculate the holomorphic functions progressively on the other vertices .",
    "however , there is at each step some finite choice to consider , in some sense , one has a kind of `` random dynamics '' .",
    "one can conclude some general philosophy . in the case of harmonic functions ,",
    "one goes to ( space ) infinity , and reproduce objects by a poisson integral . in the holomorphic case ,",
    "a random holomorphic dynamics of finite subsets of the space itself allows one to reproduce the function .",
    "we do not claim our tentative to formulate all these notions is optimal .",

    "a concrete model is obtained by taking middles of the edges of @xmath59 and drawing segments joining middles of adjacent edges .    in the sequel",
    ", we will see , analogously to the case of @xmath59 , that a holomorphic function , is constructed following some dynamics , when it is given at vertices of some triangle . as in the case of @xmath59 , a nuisance but also",
    "a richness of the dynamics comes from its non - deterministic character , that is , the switch choice .",
    "however , with respect to this point , the case of @xmath60 is highly more complicated .",
    "our attempt here is just to roughly study this dynamics , which we think is worthwhile to investigate , at least because it is natural !",

    "actually , at this stage , we do not mind on any regularity of these mappings . ,",
    "but the only `` algebraic '' condition is that , this gives rise to an involution , that is , @xmath284 is an involution .",

    "maybe , the induced mapping @xmath304 , could be thought , more naturally , as holomorphic .",
