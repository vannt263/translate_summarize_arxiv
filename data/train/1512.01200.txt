    "photon statistics of the fluorescence have been thoroughly studied for three - level atomic systems @xcite , in which case the process is ergodic , i.e. , when the mean bright and dark periods are finite . for a single quantum dot or molecule the statistics are more complicated if the process is not ergodic @xcite . in the spectral domain ,",
    "ergodic shelving manifests in the appearance of a very narrow inelastic peak on top of the central peak of the two - level - like spectrum . this has been well studied analytically and numerically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite . in the latter ,",

    "squeezing , the reduction of fluctuations below those of a coherent state in a quadrature at the expense of the other , is weak in resonance fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the low collection and imperfect quantum efficiency of photodetectors have been the main barriers for the observation of squeezing , though recent experimental progress tackle these issues . on the one hand , there is the increased solid angle of emission captured with minimal disturbance of the photon density of states surrounding the atom @xcite . on the other",
    "is the development of conditional detection schemes based on homodyne detection that cancel the finite quantum efficiency issue @xcite .",
    "we discuss two of them .",
    "homodyne correlation measurement ( hcm ) , proposed by vogel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , consists of intensity correlations of the previously mixed source and weak local oscillator fields , thus canceling the detector efficiency factors .",
    "the output contains several terms , including the variance and an amplitude - intensity correlation .",
    "very recently , hcm was used to observe squeezing in the resonance fluorescence of a single two - level quantum dot @xcite in conditions close to those for free - space atomic resonance fluorescence .",
    "in fact , in the first demonstration of hcm the amplitude - intensity correlation of the fluorescence of a single three - level ion in the @xmath0 configuration was observed @xcite though not yet in the squeezing regime .",
    "conditional homodyne detection ( chd ) was proposed and demonstrated by carmichael , orozco and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this consists of balanced homodyne detection ( bhd ) of a quadrature conditioned on an intensity measurement of part of the emitted field ; it gives the amplitude - intensity correlation of hcm but measured directly , without the interfering terms .",
    "as in the intensity correlations , the conditioning cancels the dependence on detector efficiency .",
    "the intensity detection channel has nontrivial effects on the quadrature signals .",
    "the amplitude - intensity correlation is of third order in the field amplitude , hence it allows for third order fluctuations .",
    "initially , chd was devised for weak light emitters , neglecting the third order fluctuations .",
    "this allowed to identify the fourier transform of the correlation as the spectrum of squeezing @xcite .",
    "however , recent work on chd of two - level atom resonance fluorescence has shown important deviations from the spectrum of squeezing due to increasing nonlinearity in the atom - laser interaction @xcite .",
    "an additional display of these non - gaussian fluctuations is found in the asymmetry of the correlation in cavity qed @xcite and in the resonance fluorescence of a @xmath1type three - level atom @xcite and of two blockading rydberg atoms @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically ensemble - averaged phase - dependent fluctuations of the intermittent ( ergodic ) resonance fluorescence of a single three - level atom ( 3la ) . besides numerical solutions for the one- and two - time expectation values , we obtain approximate analytical solutions which are very accurate in the limit when the decay rate of the strong transition is much larger than those of the weak transitions .",
    "our solutions are simple and reflect clearly the time and spectral scales .",
    "thus we begin by writing the expression for the coherent and phase - independent incoherent spectra of the 3la , studied numerically at length in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we compare the spectra and variances of an ideal bhd approach , as it could also be obtained from hcm , with those of the chd method .",
    "they have in common that the sharp extra peak @xcite , on atom - laser resonance , is a feature _ only _ of the quadrature that features squeezing ; in the other quadrature the spectrum is a simple broad positive lorentzian . in the weak field limit , while both methods give similar spectra for a two - level atom ( 2la ) , the sharp peak has opposite sign , reducing the squeezing in bhd and enhancing the negative peak in chd . for strong laser field",
    "the third order fluctuations of chd distort the positive lorentzian sidebands of the mollow triplet and turn them dispersive for both 2la and 3la .",
    "however , for the 3la , both the sharp peak and the dispersive sidebands are much larger than the second order spectrum .",

    "this comes out when @xmath91 become complex , that is , for @xmath146 , but is visible only for strong enough excitation that the spectral components split . while the second order peaks are lorentzians , the third order terms are dispersive and of comparable size for the 2la or bigger for the 3la .",
    "on the other hand are the large deviations in the size of spectra .",
    "the third order spectrum is much bigger in the 3la than in the 2la , not only for the sharp peak .",
    "they contribute most of the total chd spectrum .",
    "the above effects can be explained as follows .",
    "the third order correlation of fluctuation operators gives a measure of the atom - laser nonlinearity , which grows with increasing laser intensity , and the deviation from gaussian fluctuations of the fluorescence .",
    "also , it should be mentioned that the dipole fluctuations of the driven transition are enhanced due to the coupling to the long - lived state @xmath92 , which is populated by the increased number of spontaneous emission events from the excited state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_aa ] ) .",
    "an early example of this effect in the three - level configuration of this paper is the reported large deviations in the photon statistics from those of a 2la @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the chd spectrum the second and third order components can not be measured separately .",
    "the former approaches the latter only in the weak driving regime .",
    "chd goes beyond the concept of squeezing when studying phase - dependent fluctuations .",
    "finally , we calculate the integrated spectra of the chd quadratures :    @xmath147    \\ , .     \\nonumber",
    "\\\\    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    two points stand out .",
    "first , for a 2la ( @xmath30 ) , the integrated spectra are equal , as found in @xcite .",
    "this means that the total emitted noise is independent of the quadrature , as it should .",
    "this is made possible by the third order fluctuations , absent in the spectrum of squeezing , sec .",
    "[ sec : variance ] .",
    "second , for the 3la , there is additional noise due to the sharp extra peak which , as argued in @xcite , is intensity  transferred \" from the elastic spectrum to the inelastic one , to the @xmath84 quadrature to be specific as we show , due to the shelving effect .",
    "we investigated ensemble - averaged phase - dependent fluctuations of the intermittent resonance fluorescence of a single three - level atom .",
    "we focused mainly on the spectrum of squeezing by balanced homodyne detection , and on the spectrum of the amplitude - intensity correlation of conditional homodyne detection .",
    "the shelving effect produces a sharp peak in the spectrum of the quadrature that features squeezing . in bhd",
    "this peak is positive , thus reducing the amount of squeezing . in chd",
    "the sharp peak is negative in the weak to moderate excitation regime , thus enhancing the negative squeezing spectrum .",
    "this is because chd is sensitive to third order dipole fluctuations that grow with atom - laser nonlinearity .",
    "hence , for strong excitation , the spectra of bhd and chd are very different .",
    "additional insight is obtained calculating the variances or integrated spectra of quadratures . in bhd",
    "the variances are different , while in chd they are equal , where the third order term provides the additional noise .",
    "we considered only the case of exact atom - laser resonance .",
    "this allowed us to obtain very good approximate analytical solution of the master equation with a simple method , then used to construct analytical expressions for the various quantities of interest .",
    "further insight into the incoherent spectrum and its link to the phase - dependent fluctuations could be established .",
    "also , the on - resonance case allowed us to present the basic physical features in the most straightforward manner .",
    "conditional homodyne detection , with its sensitivity to third order field fluctuations , opens a new gate to study phase - dependent fluctuations beyond the realm of squeezing for highly nonlinear and non - gaussian optical processes . on the other hand , the impressive advances in photon collection efficiencies by parabolic mirrors @xcite could complement chd for atomic resonance fluorescence , its squeezing and its quantum fluctuations in general .",
