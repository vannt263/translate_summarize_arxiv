    "in the standard hierarchical model of galaxy formation , galaxies like the milky way were constructed by repeated aggregation with dwarf galaxies and this merging process left behind many streams , satellites , and substructures in the galactic halo @xcite .",

    "* ) provided astronomers a great opportunity to detect the substructures in the spheroid of the milky way photometrically and spectroscopically @xcite . among all the substructures ,",
    "the most prominent is the tidal stream from the disrupting sgr dwarf spheroid galaxy which was discovered by @xcite .",
    "others include the monoceros ring @xcite , the hercules - aquila cloud @xcite and overdensity in the direction of virgo @xcite , and so on .",
    "the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey obtained about 240,000 low resolution spectra of faint stars ( @xmath14 ) of a wide variety of spectral types .",
    "the limited number of spectra is far from enough to study the metallicity distribution of a vast area of the galaxy .",
    "the advantage of using the photometric metallicity is that the metallicity of many more stars can be obtained .",
    "@xcite derived a photometric metallicity relations in @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 plane by using f - and g - type main sequence stars , and studied the metallicity distribution of the galaxy .",
    "however , the sdss @xmath0 band photometry is limited to @xmath15 .",
    "additionally , due to the relatively large error of sdss @xmath0 band magnitude near the faint end , the application of the photometric metallicity estimates is greatly restricted in the range of @xmath16 , an insufficient depth to explore distant substructures .",
    "based on a calibration of less metallicity - sensitive color indexes in the @xmath17 passbands with well - determined spectroscopic metal abundances , @xcite determined the metal abundance estimates for main - sequence stars in the virgo overdensity .",
    "@xcite used the ubv photometry to derive the improved metallicity calibration . in this study , we will use a deep photometric survey , south galactic cap of @xmath0-band sky survey ( scuss ) , to give a photometric calibration for estimating the stellar metallicity . the scuss @xmath0 is 1.5 mag deeper than sdss @xmath0 .",
    "this deep scuss @xmath0-band data can probe a much larger volume of the halo that enable us to study the mdf of distant stream .    over the past decades",
    ", considerable efforts have also been made to gain information about the metallicity distribution of the sgr system @xcite .",
    "many works on metallicity of sgr stream are based either on high - resolution spectra of a small amount of stars or on low - resolution spectra of giant stars .",

    "@xcite selected 556 red horizontal branch stars along the sgr streams from sdss dr7 spectroscopic data , and found that the sgr stars have two peaks in the metallicity distribution while the galactic stars have a more prominent metal - poor peak .",

    "a summary is given in section 6 .",
    "the sdss is a digital multi - filter imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "it covers more than one - quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap , as well as a small ( @xmath24 deg@xmath4 ) but much deeper survey in the south galactic hemisphere .",
    "it uses five bands ( @xmath0 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) to simultaneously measure brightness of stars with the effective wavelength 3562 , 4686 , 6165 , 7481 , and 8931    respectively .",
