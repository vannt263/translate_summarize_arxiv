    "this has been confirmed by microscopic calculations by wang , zhang , and bishop @xcite , who also found that the many - electron energy levels are approximately equally spaced for quantum dots with more than 30 electrons .",

    "the nonequilibrium electron distribution in dot-1 is similar . when the level @xmath145 , @xmath146 , this level in the dot is occupied ; when the level @xmath147 , @xmath148 , this level is empty .",

    "this population inversion is similar to that in quantum cascade lasers for superlattices @xcite and other proposals for double quantum wells @xcite .",
    "however , the population inversions proposed previously for quantum wells are achieved without elastic resonant tunneling . for example , in the double quantum well systems @xcite , the upper level is attached to the lead with high chemical potential @xmath157 and with @xmath158 , so the upper level is occupied ; the lower level ( either in the same well or in another well ) is attached to the lead with lower chemical potential @xmath159 with @xmath160 , thus it is empty .",
    "since transverse momentum is conserved and can be neglected the quantized energy levels in the wells are mismatched , there is _ no _ elastic resonant tunneling , and the system is in quasi equilibrium with two chemical potentials @xmath157 and @xmath159 .",
    "the electrons can only tunnel via emitting photons . in the population inversion we proposed above",
    ", the energy levels are not in quasi equilibrium with the leads .",

    "when @xmath176 .",
    "for the e - e scattering in the typical experiments @xmath177 @xcite , so the population inversion can be achieved at @xmath178 .",
    "consequently , the e - e correlations reduce the magnitude of the resonant current but do not qualitatively change the resonance peak structure .",
    "in this section , we discuss the recent nonequilibrium experiments of ref.@xcite using the general equations derived above . in these experiments ,",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 , so we can neglect the contributions of energy levels far from resonance ( i.e. for experiment @xcite , we only need take into account 4 relevant levels ) .",
    "we use eq.([eq : curr2 ] ) to calculate the currents , which neglects the high order scattering - in(out ) processes .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for low temperature experiments of quantum dots with electron numbers on the order of 90 @xcite , as we discussed above .",
    "the oscillations of the nonlinear resonant tunneling current vs. gate voltage in experiment @xcite can be readily explained if we take into account the charging effect @xcite for the renormalized hf energy levels @xmath179 and @xmath180 [ see fig.[fig : engy ] ] . in fig.[fig : iv ] we plot the conductance of the current tunneling through the dqd vs. the gate voltage @xmath181 on dot-1 using a constant bias voltage of @xmath182 .",
    "( only one group of the peaks is shown ) .",
    "the current is calculated using eq.([eq : curr2 ] ) for @xmath183 ; @xmath184 , 10.0@xmath185 ; the level spacing in dot-1 and dot-2 as @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .    our assignment of the peaks in fig.([fig : iv ] )",
    "is the same as that in ref.@xcite .",
    "we assume in fig.([fig : iv ] ) that the spectrum in dot-2 is fixed while varying @xmath181 . using the energy level spacings given in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the spacing between the first and second peaks is @xmath188 , and the spacing between the second and third peaks is @xmath189 .",
    "however , in the experimental i - v curves , the first spacing is larger than the second one .",
    "one possible reason is that the level spacing is not regular , which is suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the gate voltage scale for these spacings are @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively .",
    "in ref.@xcite they are converted to energy scales as @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "then the level spacing between level-2 and level-3 in dot-1 is barely half of the average level spacing .",
    "another possibility is that this discrepancy can be due to the charging effect . as discussed in sec.[sec : inversion ] , without resonance between the two dots , the `` active '' levels in dot-1 are filled and the `` active '' levels in dot-2 are empty ; with resonance , the resonance level in dot-2 has population @xmath194 while the resonance level in dot-1 has population @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "so the levels in dot-1 are shifted _ down _ by @xmath197 and the levels in dot-2 are shifted _ up _ by @xmath198 .",
    "the net effect is that the current peak positions are pushed _ upward _ by @xmath199 .",
    "recall that the peak height for the resonant current is @xmath200 . in the experimental i - v curve ,",
    "the magnitude of the first peak is much smaller than that of the second and third peaks , so the second and third peaks are shifted _ up _ much more than the first peak ( due to large charging effects ) .",
    "thus the first peak spacing can be larger than the second one even if we assume the active energy levels are close to their average values .",
    "another consequences of this charging effect is that the lorentzian line shape of the current will be changed . for the experiments in @xcite ,",
    "the peak should be distorted slightly to the right side due to charging effects alone ( e.g. the high gate voltage side has a longer tail ) .",
    "however , couplings to the other levels will induce asymmetric shoulders as observed in the experiments .",
    "note that there is no 4-@xmath22 peak [ see fig.[fig : engy ] ] .",
    "the absence of this 4-@xmath22 peak was argued in @xcite to be due to rapid relaxation of level-4 to level-3 . as we discussed in sec.[sec :",
    "inversion ] that _ if _ the energy of level-4 is below @xmath2 , then level-3 is already filled without coupling between level-4 and level-3 , so even at high temperature , there should be no substantial relaxation from level-4 to level-3 . since the experiments are conducted at very low temperature ( 34mk ) , the argument that _ when level-4 is lower than @xmath2 _ there is large relaxation from level-4 to level-3 is questionable . from our fig.[fig : engy ] , we can see that , since all the levels below @xmath2 in dot-1 are filled , they is a large charging energy between 4-@xmath22 peak and this group of peaks , so the 4-@xmath22 peak is `` missing '' .",
    "the authors in @xcite found that the amplitude of the resonance peak will stay constant with increasing bias voltage , which was argued to support the large relaxation of level-4 to level-3 .",
    "however , as we discussed in sec.[sec : inversion ] , the population of the lowest active level stays constant with increasing bias voltage @xmath201 even without inelastic relaxations , the amplitude of the resonance will stay constant with increasing of bias voltage , so this phenomenon can not tell if there is large relaxation .",
    "thus , all the observations in ref.@xcite can be well explained by our calculations without the assumption of large inelastic relaxation at low temperature @xmath202 .    from our calculations",
    "the half widths of these peaks are not @xmath203 , due to coupling between multi - levels in each dot , and the increase of @xmath7 will eventually destroy the resonance as shown in fig.([fig : iv ] ) .      in a symmetrical geometry , @xmath204 and",
    "@xmath205 , the resonant tunneling current eq.([eq : curr3 ] ) can be simplified as following : @xmath206 ^ 2 + \\gamma^2|t|^2}. \\label{eq : curr - s1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is readily seen that there will be a splitting in the resonance peak @xmath10 when @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8-dependence of the resonant peak splitting is shown in fig.([fig : splt ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this splitting is clear in the strong interdot coupling limit @xmath207 : @xmath208 , \\label{eq : curr - s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is just resonant tunneling through a two level single dot system .",
    "this is not surprising , since in the strong interdot coupling limit , the two dots can be treated as a single system ( for these two resonant levels  this is not true for other non - resonant levels ) , two degenerate levels will be split by @xmath209 due to interdot coupling .",
    "however , if the dot - lead coupling strength is stronger , then each dot is coupled to its own reservoir , and then weakly coupled to each other .",
    "if the two reservoirs are out of equilibrium , then these two dots can not be treated as a single system . from eq.([eq : curr - s1 ] ) , there will be no peak splitting in this regime @xcite .",

    "when @xmath211 , the splitting @xmath212 , and our result becomes equivalent to that in cbt .",
    "in summary , we have developed a microscopic theory for the equilibrium and nonequilibrium transport through a double quantum dot ( dqd ) .",
    "the analytical expressions for resonant tunneling current peaks were derived in both linear and nonlinear conductance regimes .",
    "we showed that the nonequilibrium electron distribution has important effects on the resonant tunneling through dqd systems in the nonlinear regime , and it is necessary to be take into account these nonequilibrium distributions to interpret nonlinear tunneling experiments .",
    "we also find that multi - level coupling affects the width of resonant tunneling current peaks .",

    "most interestingly , we predict that the population of electrons in the active levels of one dot can be inverted in the nonequilibrium regime by changing the gate voltage to make the upper level in the 2nd dot match with an active level in the 1st dot .",

    "<S> resonant tunneling through zero dimensional ( 0d ) states of coupled quantum dots has been studied experimentally by several groups in both equilibrium ( @xmath0 ) and nonequilibrium ( @xmath1 ) regimes @xcite ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are chemical potentials of leads externally attached to the quantum dots from left and right , respectively ) . the coulomb blockade theory ( cbt ) </S>",
    "<S> was used to study the equilibrium properties of electronic tunneling in a double quantum dot ( dqd ) system @xcite , and more recently@xcite , has been extended to explain the tunneling current peak splitting observed in the experiment of waugh et al@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most previous theoretical studies on dqd systems @xcite concentrated on the equilibrium properties . </S>",
    "<S> interesting properties in the nonequilibrium regimes @xcite , where each dot can have _ different _ thermal nonequilibrium states driven by the two leads , have received much less attention . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use a microscopic tunneling model to study the electronic transport through dqd systems based on the nonequilibrium green s function ( ngf ) method . using the ngf method , </S>",
    "<S> the resonant tunneling current can then be derived exactly in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes for tunneling through an interacting quantum dot @xcite and non - interacting multi - quantum dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we give a general expression for the current for tunneling through interacting multi - level double quantum dot systems . </S>",
    "<S> the general current we derived can be used to obtain the well - known current equations in the equilibrium regime . in the nonequilibrium regime , it is usually difficult to satisfy detailed current balance between different dots and leads in various approximations @xcite , except in the case that the contribution to the imaginary self - energy is only from the lead - dot coupling . in this case , the current equation is much simplified and can be written in a compact form .    in this paper , we study resonant tunnelings through double quantum dots , each of them having more than 50 electrons . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> only the quasi - particle states are relevant to the resonant tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of quasi - particle states near the fermi surface will not change significantly with changing the electron number from @xmath4 to @xmath5 except for a slight energy level shift mainly due to the `` charging effect '' . </S>",
    "<S> this has been confirmed for quantum dot systems with @xmath6 by microscopic calculations @xcite . in general , various scattering contributions to the imaginary self - energy ( scattering - in scattering - out processes ) can be discussed phenomenologically using our current equation below , which is useful for interpretation of experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the general current equation derived here to discuss experimental results performed in the nonequilibrium regime @xcite ; some of our explanations are different from previous ones@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will see that the study of nonequilibrium electron distributions in the quantum dots are crucial to understand nonequilibrium experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the couplings of lead - dot and dot - dot are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , we predict that in symmetric equilibrium experiments @xcite a peak of the resonant tunneling current will split only when @xmath9 with a splitting magnitude @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we predict that a population inversion can be achieved in one of the two quantum dots when the tunneling between the two dots is in resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this population inversion should be easily realized under conditions such as the low temperature experiments of ref.@xcite . at high temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the population inversion critically depends on electron - phonon ( e - p ) or electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering induced relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> this population inversion is similar to that in quantum cascade lasers ( qcl ) @xcite except that the former co - exists with resonant tunneling and the tunneling is not photon - assisted . </S>",
    "<S> thus population inversion can be achieved in the double quantum wells under similar conditions as for qcl .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we discuss the model and derive the general current equations ; in section  [ sec : app ] we discuss various approximations and the simplified current equations ; in section  [ sec : inversion ] we discuss the non - equilibrium distribution of electrons in a double quantum dot system and the possibility of population inversion ; in section  [ sec : exp ] , we discuss two recent experiments ; and we conclude in section  [ sec : sum ] . </S>"
