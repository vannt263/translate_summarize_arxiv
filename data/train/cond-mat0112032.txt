    "in this work , we deal with the effect of surface anisotropy on the hysteretic properties ( hysteresis loop and limit - of - metastability curve , the so - called sw astroid @xcite ) of a single - domain spherical particle of simple cubic crystalline structure , uniaxial anisotropy in the core , and radial single - site anisotropy for spins on the boundary . we compute the hysteresis loop and thereby the critical field of this particle by solving , at zero temperature , the local landau - lifshitz equation ( lle ) derived from the classical anisotropic dirac - heisenberg model in field ( [ dh ] ) .",
    "doing this for different values of the polar angle @xmath0 between the applied field and the core easy axis , renders the critical field as a function of @xmath0 , that is the sw astroid .",
    "finally , our model hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unit spin vector on site @xmath3 @xmath4 is the uniform magnetic field applied in a direction @xmath0 with respect to the reference @xmath5 axis , @xmath6 is the total number of spins ; @xmath7 is the nearest - neighbour exchange coupling ; the last term in ( [ dh ] ) is the uniaxial anisotropy energy with easy axis @xmath8 and constant @xmath9 .",
    "core spins have an easy axis along @xmath5 and constant @xmath10 , while surface spins have radial easy axes and constant @xmath11 . in the sequel , we use the reduced parameters , @xmath12    the only free parameter of our model is the surface anisotropy constant @xmath13 .",
    "so upon varying it we estimate its value at which deviations from the ( macroscopic ) stoner - wohlfarth model are observed .",
    "details of the method used here and more results can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "fig .  [ fig1_jap ] shows that when @xmath13 becomes comparable with @xmath14 , the competition between exchange coupling and surface anisotropy produces large deviations from the sw model .",
    "namely , the hysteresis loop exhibits multiple jumps , which can be attributed to the switching of different spherical shells of spins starting from surface down to the centre .",
    "the hysteresis loop is then characterised by two field values : one that marks the limit of metastability , called the _ critical field _ or the saturation field , and the other that marks the magnetization switching , and is called the _ switching field _ or the coercive field . in fig .",
    "[ fig2_jap]a we present the variation with the particle s diameter of the critical field @xcite ( in diamonds ) obtained from the numerical solution of the lle for @xmath15 , and ( in circles ) the sw critical field multiplied by the core - to - volume ratio , i.e. @xmath16 , analytically obtained upon assuming infinite exchange coupling .",
    "this figure also shows that for such a value of @xmath13 , when the field is applied along the core easy axis , the critical field increases with the particle s size , and that for @xmath17 all hysteresis loops can be scaled with those rendered by the sw model .",
    "( 9,8.5)(-1,-9.0 )    ( 9,8.5)(0,-9.0 )    on the other hand , these results clearly show that even in a large particle there still exist some magnetic inhomogeneities that lead to deviations from the sw hypothesis of uniform rotation , as this is only rigorously realized in an infinite system . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig2_jap ] shows that the critical field of a spherical particle with @xmath18 can be obtained from the sw model through a scaling with constant @xmath16 .",
    "one should also note that the astroid for all particle sizes falls inside that of sw , see fig .",
    "[ fig2_jap]b .",
    "therefore , for @xmath19 our model renders hysteresis loops and limit - of - metastability curves that scale with the sw results for all values of the angle @xmath0 , the scaling constant being @xmath16 , which is smaller than unity for a particle of any finite size . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical field increases with the particle s size and tends to the sw critical field in infinite systems .",
    "( 9,8.5)(0,-9.0 )    for larger values of @xmath20 , but @xmath21 , we still have some kind of scaling but the corresponding constant now depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this is reflected by a deformation of the limit - of - metastability curve .",
    "more precisely , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig3_jap]a , the latter is depressed in the core easy direction and enhanced in the perpendicular direction . however , there is still only one jump in the hysteresis loop implying that the magnetization reversal can be considered as uniform . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig3_jap]b shows that for @xmath22 there are two new features in comparison with the previous case ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig2_jap]a ) : the values of the switching field are much higher , and more importantly , its behaviour as a function of the particle s size is opposite to that of the previous case , as now the field increases when the particle s size is decreased . for such high values of @xmath13 ( @xmath23 )",
    "surface spins are aligned along their easy axes , and because of the strong exchange coupling they also drive core spins in their switching process .",
    "thus the smaller the particle the larger the surface contribution , and the larger the field required for a complete reversal of the particle s magnetization .",
    "( 9,8.5)(-1,-9.0 )    in fig .  [ fig4_jap ] @xmath24 first slightly decreases for @xmath25 and then increases , and when @xmath13 becomes of the order of @xmath14 it jumps to large values .",
    "this plot illustrates the different regimes discussed above according to the value of the ratio @xmath20 . for an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath11 and the critical field @xmath26 at the point @xmath27 , consider a 4 nm spherical cobalt particle for which @xmath28 8 mev , @xmath29 erg/@xmath30 .",
    "then , @xmath31 erg/@xmath32 , and @xmath33 t , when the field is applied along the core easy axis .",
    "considering the fact that experiments on nanoparticles show that the switching field does increase when the particle s size decreases ( see e.g. @xcite for cobalt particles ) , we may conclude that the anisotropy constant @xmath11 is at least of the order of the exchange coupling @xmath34 , inasmuch as we can assume radial anisotropy on the surface , as is usually done in the literature . then",
    ", as discussed above , for such values of @xmath11 , large deviations are observed with respect to the sw model in the hysteresis loop and thereby the limit - of - metastability curve , since in this case the magnetisation reverses its direction in a non - uniform manner via a progressive switching of spin clusters .",
    "so to deal with these features one has to resort to microscopic approaches such as the one used in this work .",
    "a work in progress applies the present technique to the cubo - octahedral cobalt particles with a diameter of about 3 nm recently reported on in @xcite ."
