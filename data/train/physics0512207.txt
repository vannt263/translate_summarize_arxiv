    "recently , a scheme for inducing gravitation - like interatomic potentials has been proposed @xcite , opening up the possibility to create self - bound bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme , the gravitation - like interatomic potential can be achieved by irradiating the atoms with intense , extremely off - resonant electromagnetic fields .",
    "the usual strong anisotropy due to dipole - dipole interactions can , in fact , be averaged out @xcite by the proper combination of laser beams , leaving a @xmath2 potential , where @xmath3 is the strength of the potential ( the analogue of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the newton s constant and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses ) and @xmath8 is the interparticle distance .",
    "the strength @xmath3 of the potential can be adjusted by changing the laser intensity @xcite .    in ultracold atomic gases , two interesting regimes for self - bound becs",
    "have been predicted , assuming that the short - range interatomic interactions can be independently tuned by , say , applying a magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite . in one regime ,",
    "the attractive @xmath0 interactions are balanced by the repulsive mean field interation assuming a positive two - body scattering length and negligible kinetic energy . in the other regime ,",
    "the balancing factor is kinetic energy , assuming negligible mean field interactions . in both regimes ,",
    "the resulting bec is self - bound . from a broader point of view , the induced gravitation - like interaction might make possible experimental emulation of boson stars ( a system of self - gravitating bosons ) in the regime where the kinetic energy balances the @xmath2 potential @xcite .",
    "moreover , purely attractive @xmath0 potentials constitute an interesting contrast to the attractive _ and _ repulsive coulomb potentials atomic physics are used to .",
    "the existence of a lower bound for the ground state energy in many - body systems interacting through attractive @xmath0 potentials is of fundamental importance in order to prove the existence of the thermodynamical limit and the stability of normal matter @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a system of @xmath9 identical , spinless ( or spin stretched ) bosons of mass @xmath7 interacting gravitationally , the lower and upper bounds for the ground state energy are , respectively , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the upper bound was obtained variationally . for small @xmath9",

    ", we have used the adiabatic hyperspherical representation for this systm to obtain effective three - body potentials , the corresponding channel functions , and the nonadiabatic couplings . using these",
    ", we calculate the ground state and low - lying @xmath1 excited state energies converged to seven digits .",
    "we have also used the adiabatic hyperspherical representation to obtain lower and upper bounds that differ by about @xmath17 , indicating that a simple single - channel description offers a quite accurate description of such systems .",
    "we have solved the schrdinger equation in hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "after separation of the center - of - mass motion , the system is described by the hyperradius @xmath18 which gives the overall size ; three euler angles @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , specifying the orientation of the plane containing the three particles relative to the space - fixed frame ; and other two hyperangles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , describing the internal relative motion between the particles . we have defined @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a modification of smith - whitten coordinates @xcite .",
    "the key to the adiabatic hyperspherical representation is that the dynamics of the three - body system is reduced to collective motion under the influence of one - dimensional effective potentials in @xmath18 , which is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations .",
