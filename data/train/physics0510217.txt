    "it can physically be viewed as an adaptation and extension of the steady - state flux - over - population method of computing transition rates , so we call it steady - state relaxation .",
    "the steady - state expressions for the fptd moments are simple enough for straightforward statistical error analysis , which permits the accuracy of the computed moments for a given amount of simulation data to be estimated .",
    "this analysis can also be used to optimize the allocation of computational effort over the different mesoscopic states and to thereby reduce the total cost of the numerical simulations required for fixed accuracy .",
    "this is important since computability of the fptd in large problems will often be limited by this cost .",
    "such optimization improved efficiency over two - fold in a test problem with five mesoscopic states , and greater improvements are possible in problems with more states .",
