    "the tevatron collider at fermilab continues its operation of run  ii since 2001 .",
    "the @xmath10 collisions are produced at @xmath11 with yet increasing instantaneous luminosity .",
    "the amount of integrated luminosity delivered to the cdf and d@xmath12 experiments has surpassed that of run  i by nearly a factor of 5 , exceeding @xmath13 by july 2004 .",
    "the @xmath10 collisions are an abundant source of beauty and charm hadrons . the upgraded collider detector at fermilab ( cdf  ii )  @xcite can effectively select many of the decay modes of the beauty and charm hadrons .",
    "this allows for an analysis or search of statistics limited , rare processes .",
    "the components of the cdf  ii detector pertinent to the analyses presented here are described briefly below .",
    "detailed description can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical drift chamber ( cot ) and the silicon microstrip detector ( svx  ii ) are immersed in a @xmath14 solenoidal magnetic field and allow for tracking charged particles in the range of @xmath15 with good position precision ( impact parameter , @xmath16 , resolution @xmath17 ) and good momentum precision ( transverse momentum , @xmath18 , resolution @xmath19 ) .",
    "the muon subdetector includes the cmu ( detectable muon @xmath20 ) , cmp ( @xmath21 ) covering the pseudorapidity range of @xmath22 , and cmx ( @xmath23 ) covering the range of @xmath24 .",
    "cdf  ii employs a 3 level trigger system .",
    "two sets of triggers are used by the analyses presented here : the _ dimuon _ and _ two - track _ triggers .",
    "the _ dimuon _",
    "trigger selects two muons ( track associated with the hits in a muon subdetector ) with @xmath20 .",
    "the _ two - track _ trigger selects tracks with @xmath23 and uses the level-2 silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) to select on the impact parameter of a track with respect to the beamline .",
    "the impact parameter resolution is below @xmath25 .",
    "the tracks are selected with @xmath26  mm .",
    "the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decay @xmath4  is highly suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is many orders of magnitude beyond the reach of the present experiments .",
    "observation of this decay at a rate significantly exceeding the sm expectation would indicate the presence of non - sm particles or couplings .",
    "thus a large , unexplored region exists in which to search for new physics .",
    "this search uses a @xmath28 data sample .",
    "the sample of @xmath29 @xmath30-tagged two - body @xmath31  decays selected by the two - track trigger is used to estimate backgrounds , to optimize selection requirements , and to normalize the sensitivity of the search from the data sample itself .",
    "the @xmath32 upper limit for the given confidence level ( cl ) is determined using @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normalization branching fraction , @xmath35 is the number of @xmath36  events observed , @xmath37 is the upper limit on the observed @xmath4  signal events with the expected background accounted for .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the efficiency and acceptance for each mode . except for the muon identification , and the assignment of different particle masses ,",

    "the width of the reconstructed mass peak for two - body decays of the @xmath31   is sufficient to separate @xmath43   from @xmath44 .",
    "the dominant sources of the background here are the combinatorial background ( estimated using the events in the high mass sideband ) , and the muon misidentification background , when a pion is misidentified as a muon ( estimated using the sample of @xmath30-tagged @xmath45 events ) .",
