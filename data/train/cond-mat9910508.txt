    "there has been an increased interest in the theory of zero temperature quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "distinctively from temperature driven critical phenomena , these phase transitions occur at zero temperature as a function of some non - thermal control parameter ( or a competition between different parameters describing the basic interaction of the system ) , and the relevant fluctuations are of quantum rather than thermal nature . in this type of critical phenomena",
    "the time plays a crucial and fundamental role .",
    "the coupling of statistics and dynamics that is inherent to quantum statistical problems introduces effective dimensionalities in the hyperscaling laws , i.e. the space dimensionality @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the dynamic critical exponent ) . in this case",

    "divergent length scales play a crucial role in continuous phase transitions . unlike classical models , where the scaling can be done equally for all `` spatial '' dimensions , quantum models are anisotropic in general , and therefore the `` space '' and `` imaginary - time '' directions will not scale in the same fashion . according to general hypothesis of finite - size scaling theory  @xcite extended here for quantum ( anisotropic ) system , a physical quantity @xmath19 ( with @xmath2 measuring the distance from the critical point , @xmath20 is an ordering field coupled to the order parameter",

    ", we will discuss the two limiting cases which were subjects of several investigations during the past two decades .",
    "the first case corresponds to zero temperature and is called hereafter the quantum critical behaviour . here",
    "equation  ( [ fssa ] ) reduces to @xmath32 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the rescaling factor @xmath30 to be proportional to the linear size of the system .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath33 here the situation resembles that of systems exhibiting classical ( thermal ) phase transition .",
    "it is possible to get another result for the scaling function in the right hand side of equation  ( [ fssl ] ) , if one considers the variable @xmath34 instead of the first variable of the scaling function @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is introduced in such a way to account for the shift of the critical quantum parameter to the value corresponding to the rounding of the thermodynamic functions , when the number of the infinite dimensions @xmath37 is less than its lower critical dimension @xmath38 . for the opposite case",
    "we have just a shift of the critical control parameter . in this case",
    "we find that the critical exponents are those of a @xmath37 dimensional system ( see for example  @xcite ) . by definition",
    "the finite - size shift is given by @xmath39 in general we have @xmath40 and so this quantity shrinks to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the arguments of the scaling functions get replaced by zero , we will obtain universal critical amplitudes , characterizing the whole class of universality .",
    "here we have to emphasize that the values of the universal critical amplitudes are different depending upon the point in which they are calculated i.e. @xmath2 or @xmath36 .",
    "the second case we consider is the one corresponding to the bulk system ( @xmath41 ) at finite - temperature . in this case",
    "the scaling form ( [ fssa ] ) transforms into ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references there ) @xmath42 where we used the relation @xmath43 between the temperature and the rescaling parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the same predictions for the shift and the critical amplitudes remain valid here .",
    "we find it convenient to use @xmath44 as a linear `` temporal '' size instead of the inverse temperature .",
    "the general case corresponding to both quantum and finite - size effects can be studied by considering a system with larger dimension @xmath45 confined to a general geometry of the form @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the inverse temperature can be used as an additional size in the imaginary - time direction creates some anisotropy in the system .",
    "this property will lead to the establishment of some change in the scaling properties of the finite quantum system . in the general case we can consider the quantum to classical and the finite - size to the bulk system different crossover phenomena .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself about this statement by thinking on the dynamic critical exponent which is different for different quantum systems .",
    "the situation of the combined investigations of finite - size scaling and quantum to classical crossover is similar to the one formulated in the framework of the phenomenological study of finite - size scaling in anisotropic systems  @xcite . in this case",
    "one can investigate the interplay of quantum and finite - size scaling .",
    "for example in the case when the quantum effects are leading compared to the finite - size ( this case will be called here `` low - temperature '' case ) i.e. @xmath47 , from equation  ( [ fssa ] ) to first order in @xmath48 , we expect to obtain @xmath49 instead of equation  ( [ fsst ] ) . this shows how the finite - size effects give rise to some corrections to the quantum scaling .",
    "following the same reasoning in the case of `` very low - temperature '' i.e. @xmath50 , when the finite - size contributions to the ground state energy and its derivatives are dominant compared to those coming from the quantum effects , we find @xmath51 showing a correction to the zero - temperature finite - size scaling due to the temperature .",
    "these ideas has been tested in the framework of the spherical quantum rotor model in ref .",
    "we will compare the scaling forms  ( [ correction ] ) and ( [ cortosca ] ) with the available analytical results obtained below .",

    "the finite temperature corrections lead those coming from the finite size of the system .",
    "the scaling form of the saddle point equation is given by    [ ltasym ] @xmath193 where we used the functions @xmath194 and @xmath195    the last function has been proposed in ref .",

    "we get _ exponential corrections_. in the case of long - range interactions we have a _ power - law corrections_. this seems to be a general characteristic for systems with long range interaction ( for the case of the spherical model see references @xcite ) .    in the particular case of the two dimensional system with short - range interaction @xmath201",

    "it adds the property of exact solvabilty at any dimension .",
    "this makes it very attractive for the exploration of the the scaling properties of quantum critical phenomena as well as finite - size scaling theory .    in the paper we present investigations on the finite - size scaling of the @xmath1-model in the vicinity of its quantum critical point .",
    "the striking characteristic of the model is the presence of long - range interaction decaying at large distances @xmath2 with a power law as @xmath3 .",
    "we considered the model confined to the general geometry of the form @xmath184 , where @xmath22 is the spatial size of the system , @xmath216 and @xmath11 is the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "the results are obtained by considering the temperature which governs the crossover between the classical and the quantum critical behaviors as an additional temporal dimension .",
    "a detailed investigation of the alteration of the zero temperature critical behaviour of the model due to the finite temperature is performed . for dimensions @xmath126",
    ", we studied the critical behaviour of the bulk model in the tree different regions : classical renormalized , quantum critical and quantum disordered with different behaviors of the correlation length as function of the temperature .",
    "the behavior of the correlation length in these different regions as a function of the dimensionality is calculated .",
    "also , some critical amplitudes are evaluated .",
    "the large @xmath22 behavior and the scaling forms accounting for the finite size effects is derived for the free energy and the saddle point equation . for the finite - size shift of the the critical quantum parameter",
    ", we found @xmath217 in accordance with the general postulates of finite - size scaling .",

    "the study of the general case when the system is confined to the general geometry @xmath218 i.e. when the temperature as well as the sizes of the system are finite turns out to be a very difficult task because of the high anisotropy of the system due to the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless one can make interesting deductions in some limiting cases : ( * i * ) in the low - temperature regime ( @xmath191 ) , the finite - size corrections to the low - temperature behavior are _ exponentially _ small in the case of short - range interaction and are decreasing with a _ power law _ in the case of long - range interaction , ( * ii * ) in the very low - temperature regime ( @xmath192 ) , however , the finite temperature correction to the finite - size behaviour are always _ exponentially _ small .    here , we confined our investigations on the static critical properties of the model , believing that the spherical limit ( @xmath8 ) provides a useful tool for studying quantum critical phenomena in dimensions @xmath219 .",
    "the dynamic properties are not well described in this limit and require loop corrections ( see e.g. reference @xcite in the case of the nonlinear quantum sigma model ) .",
    "though derived for the special case of the @xmath1 model with long - range interaction in the large @xmath4 limit , the obtained here results are expected to hold also for many other cases .",
    "for example , recently , a model suitable to handle the joint description of classical and quantum fluctuations in an exact manner , was considered in a number of publications  .",
    "this model is a modification of the @xmath1-lattice model used extensively in the investigation of the critical behaviour of the the structural phase transitions  @xcite , in the spirit of the self - consistent phonon approximation method  @xcite .",

    "@xcite in order to investigate the zero temperature finite - size scaling of an anharmonic crystal with long - range interaction at zero temperature .",
    "they are entire function series of finite order of growth defined by @xmath222 one of the most striking properties of this function is that it obeys the following identity @xmath223 which is obtained by means of term - by - term integration of the series ( [ gfunction ] ) .",
    "the identity ( [ identity1 ] ) lies in the basis of the mathematical investigation of finite - size scaling in quantum systems with long - range interaction .    in some particular cases",
    "the functions @xmath221 reduce to known functions . here",
    "we will give some examples which are of interest for us in this paper :    @xmath224    @xmath225    and @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the confluent hypergeometric function  @xcite .",
    "if we set in the identity  ( [ identity1 ] ) @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 , we will obtain the laplace transform @xmath231 from which we derive a new identity by setting @xmath232 : @xmath233 with the aid of the last equation we obtained the large @xmath22 asymptotic behaviour  ( [ saddleasymptotic ] ) from equation  ( [ saddlezero ] ) .",
    "the integral representation of the functions @xmath234 is obtained with the aid of the hankel s integral for the inverse of the gamma function @xmath235 where the integration contour @xmath236 is a loop which starts and ends at @xmath237 and encircles the origin in the positive sense : @xmath238 on @xmath236  @xcite .",
    "this enables to get the result @xmath239 the last result is valid only for @xmath240 .",
    "the integrand in ( [ intrep ] ) has a branch - point at @xmath241 .",
    "a more complete and detailed analysis of the function @xmath221 will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "this integral representation is helpful for obtaining the asymptotic behaviour for @xmath242 .    in the following",
    "we will investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the functions @xmath243 for real argument @xmath11 .",
    "this may performed by the use of the series @xmath244 for @xmath245 .",
    "the second part of the right hand side of the last equation is nothing but the expansion in series of the hypergeometric function @xmath246 multiplied by some coefficients .",
    "so by simple rearrangement equation ( [ sqrts ] ) takes the form @xmath247    using the integral representation ( [ intrep ] ) and the identity ( [ hyperg ] ) we get the asymptotics ( for @xmath248 ) @xmath249 in the particular case @xmath250 , the last equation reduces to @xmath251",
    "here we present the asymptotic behaviours of the functions @xmath253 , given in ( [ asymptotic ] ) for small and large @xmath197 .",
    "these functions are defined by @xmath254        in order to be able to get a reasonable expression for the integral in the last equation we have to avoid the divergence in the square brackets . to this end",
    "we add and subtract from the function @xmath257 its small asymptotic behaviour to the first order ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) , which enables us to write ( after some algebra )        here @xmath261 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the expression in equation  ( [ madelung ] ) is a generalization of the madelung type constant .",
    "it is @xmath197 independent .",
    "indeed this equation defines the finite - size shift of the critical quantum parameter @xmath153 at zero temperature .",
    "it is easy ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) to show that equations ( [ madelung ] ) and ( [ shift ] ) are equivalent .      for large @xmath197 the asymptotics the function @xmath253",
    "are obtained by substituting the large @xmath262 behaviour of the functions @xmath263 from equation  ( [ asymp ] ) in the definition ( [ delta_xi ] ) . after some calculations one ends up with @xmath264    99 k. binder , lecture notes in phys . *",
