    "acoustic wave modes in dusty plasma have received a great deal of attention since the last decade @xcite .",
    "depending on different time scales , there can exists two or more acoustic waves in a typical dusty plasma .",
    "dust acoustic ( da ) and dust ion - acoustic ( dia ) waves are two such acoustic waves in a plasma containing electrons , ions , and charged dust grains .",
    "shukla and silin @xcite were the first to show that due to the quasi neutrality condition @xmath15 and the strong inequality @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are , respectively , the number density of electrons , ions , and dust particles , where @xmath20 is the number of electrons residing on the dust grain surface ) , a dusty plasma ( with negatively charged static dust grains ) supports low - frequency dia waves with phase velocity much smaller ( larger ) than electron ( ion ) thermal velocity . in case of long wavelength limit",
    "the dispersion relation of dia wave is similar to that of ion - acoustic ( ia ) wave for a plasma with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average ion ( electron ) temperature . due to the usual dusty plasma approximations ( @xmath16 and @xmath24 ) , a dusty plasma can not support the usual ia waves , but the dia waves of shukla and silin @xcite can .",
    "thus dia waves are basically ia waves , modified by the presence of heavy dust particulates",
    ". the theoretical prediction of shukla and silin @xcite was supported by a number of laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the linear properties of dia waves in dusty plasma are now well understood @xcite .",
    "dust ion - acoustic solitary waves ( diasws ) have been investigated by several authors .",
    "bharuthram and shukla @xcite studied the diasws in an unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of isothermal electrons , cold ions , in both static and mobile dust particles . employing reductive perturbation method , mamun and shukla @xcite investigated the cylindrical and spherical diasws in an unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of inertial ions , isothermal electrons , and stationary dust particles .",
    "they @xcite have also investigated the condition for existence of positive and negative potential diasws .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that in the dust - modified ion acoustic regime , negative structures can also be generated , beside positive potential soliton if the polytropic index @xmath25 for electrons .",
    "the effect of ion - fluid temperature on diasws structures have been investigated by sayed and mamun @xcite in a dusty plasma containing adiabatic ion - fluid , boltzmann electrons , and static dust particles .    in most of the earlier works ,",
    "maxwellian velocity distribution function for lighter species of particles has been used to study diasws and dia double layers ( diadls ) .",
    "however the dusty plasma with nonthermally / suprathermally distributed electrons observed in a number of heliospheric environments @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable importance to study nonlinear wave structures in a dusty plasma in which lighter species ( electrons ) is nonthermally / suprathermally distributed .",
    "berbri and tribeche @xcite have investigated weakly nonlinear dia shock waves in a dusty plasma with nonthermal electrons .",
    "recently baluku _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated diasws in an unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of cold dust particles and kappa distributed electrons using both small and arbitrary amplitude techniques .    in the present investigation",
    "we have considered the problem of existence of diasws and diadls in a plasma consisting of negatively charged dust grains , adiabatic positive ions and nonthermal electrons .",
    "three basic parameters of the present dusty plasma system are @xmath10 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are respectively the ratio of unperturbed number density of nonthermal electrons to that of ions , the ratio of average temperature of ions to that of nonthermal electrons , a parameter associated with the nonthermal distribution of electrons .",
    "nonthermal distribution of electrons becomes isothermal one if @xmath28 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigated diasws and diadls thoroughly , giving special emphasis on the followings : + ( * a * ) to study the nonlinear properties of dia waves in a dusty plasma with nonthermal electrons .",
    "( * b * ) to find the exact bounds ( lower and upper ) of the mach number @xmath3 for the existence of solitary wave solutions .",
    "( * c * ) as double layer solution plays an important role to restrict the occurrence of at least one sequence of solitary waves of same polarity , we set up an analytical theory to find the double layer solution of the energy integral , which help us to find the mach number at which double layer occurs and also , to find the amplitude of that double layer solution .",
    "( * d * ) on the basis of the analytical theory for the existence of solitary waves and double layers , the present plasma system has been analyzed numerically . actually , analyzing the sagdeev potential , we have found qualitatively different solution spaces or the compositional parameter spaces showing the nature of existing solitary structures of the energy integral . from these solution spaces ,",
    "the main observations are the followings .",
    "( * d1 * ) for isothermal electrons , the present plasma system does not support any double layer solution in both cold and adiabatic cases . for nonthermal electrons , the present plasma system does not support any positive potential double layer ( ppdl ) solution , whereas negative potential double layers ( npdls ) start to occur whenever the nonthermal parameter exceeds a critical value .",
    "however this npdl solution is unable to restrict the occurrence of all negative potential solitary waves ( npsws ) of the present system , i.e. , npdl solution is not the ultimate solution of the energy integral in the negative potential side .",
    "actually , we have observed two different types of npsws , in which amplitude of first type of npsw is restricted by the amplitude of npdl whereas the amplitude of npdl is unable to restrict the amplitude of the second type npsws . as a result , we have observed a finite jump in amplitudes between two different types of npsws separated by a npdl .",
    "this fact has also been observed recently by verheest@xcite and baluku _ _ et al.__@xcite for ion - acoustic solitary wave with different plasma constituents .",
    "( * d2 * ) for any physically admissible values of the parameters of the system , specifically , for any value of @xmath10 and any value of @xmath29 , npsw exists for all @xmath4 except @xmath30 , where @xmath2 is the lower bound of mach number @xmath3 , i.e. , solitary structures start to exist for @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the mach number corresponding to a npdl solution . however , if the parameter @xmath10 exceeds a critical value @xmath31 , ppsws exist for all @xmath32 whenever the mach number lies within the interval @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a physically admissible upper bound of @xmath10 and @xmath13 is the upper bound of @xmath3 for the existence of ppsws only , i.e. , there does not exist any ppsw if @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the coexistence of both ppsws and npsws is possible for all @xmath35 whenever @xmath33 , but npsws still exist for @xmath12 .",
    "( * d3 * ) for nonthermal electron species , we have investigated the entire solution space of the energy integral with respect to the nonthermal parameter @xmath29 and we have found four qualitatively different solution spaces depending on the cut off values of @xmath10 . actually , here we are able to define three cut off values @xmath31 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 of @xmath10 such that @xmath38 for any given value of @xmath26 , and consequently , we can partition the entire range of @xmath10 in the following four disjoint subintervals : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for these four disjoint subintervals of @xmath10 , we have four different solution spaces of the energy integral with respect to nonthermal parameter @xmath29",
    ". these solution spaces can define all types of solitary structures of the present system .",
    "( * d4 * ) finally , considering any solution space , one can get new results and physical ideas for the formation of solitary structures if he moves the solution space through the family of curves parallel to the curve @xmath14 .",
    "if we move the solution space through the family of curves parallel to the curve @xmath14 , it is simple to understand the mathematics as well as physics for the formation of double layer solution and it is also simple to understand the relation between solitons and double layer solution .    the present paper is organized as follows : basic equations are given in .",
    "derivation of energy integral along with sagdeev potential is given in .",
    "physical interpretation for the existence of solitary structures of the energy integral is given in .",
    "the lower and upper bounds of the mach number for the existence of solitary structures are given in .",
    "in , the analytical method to find the upper bound of the mach number for the existence of ppsws is given .",
    "in , we find that the existence of npdl solution may restrict occurrence of npsws having amplitude less than the amplitude of npdl . in , an analytical theory to find the double layer solution of the energy integral has been provided . in",
    ", an algorithm has been provided to find the value of mach number at which double layer solution exists and also the amplitude of that double layer . following a logical sequence of numerical scheme based on the theoretical discussions as given in and ,",
    "the solution spaces have been constructed in . finally , we have concluded our findings in .",
    "the governing equations describing the nonlinear behavior of dia waves , propagating along @xmath43-axis , in collisionless , unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged immobile dust grains are the following : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "here we have used the notation @xmath49 or @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath43 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the ion number density , electron number density , ion velocity , ion pressure , electrostatic potential , spatial variable and time , and they have been normalized by @xmath18 ( unperturbed ion number density ) , @xmath17 ( unperturbed electron number density ) , @xmath58(@xmath59 ) ( ion - acoustic speed ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62(debye length ) , and @xmath63 ( ion plasma period ) . here",
    "@xmath64 is the adiabatic index , @xmath65 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , the average temperatures of ions and electrons , @xmath68 is the mass of an ion , @xmath19 is the dust number density , @xmath20 is the number of negative unit charges residing on dust grain surface , and @xmath69 is the charge of an electron .",
    "the above equations are supplemented by nonthermally distributed electrons as prescribed by cairns _",
    "@xcite for the electron species .",
    "nonthermal distribution of any lighter species of particles ( as prescribed by cairns _",
    "@xcite for the electron species ) can be regarded as a modified boltzmannian distribution , which has the property that the number of particles in phase space in the neighborhood of the point @xmath70 is much smaller than the number of particles in phase space in the neighborhood of the point @xmath70 for the case of boltzmann distribution , where @xmath71 is the velocity of the particle in phase space . under the above mentioned normalization of the dependent and independent variables , the normalized number density of nonthermal electrons",
    "can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 with @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the parameter associated with nonthermal distribution of electrons and this parameter determines the proportion of fast energetic electrons . from ( [ beta1 ] ) and the inequality @xmath74 , it can be easily checked that the nonthermal parameter @xmath29 is restricted by the following inequality : @xmath76 .",
    "however we can not take the whole region of @xmath29 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "plotting the nonthermal velocity distribution of electrons against its velocity ( @xmath71 ) in phase space , it can be easily shown that the number of electrons in phase space in the neighborhood of the point @xmath70 decreases with increasing @xmath29 and the number of electrons in phase space in the neighborhood of the point @xmath70 is almost zero when @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , for increasing @xmath29 distribution function develops wings , which become stronger as @xmath29 increases , and at the same time the center density in phase space drops , the latter as a result of the normalization of the area under the integral .",
    "consequently , we should not take values of @xmath79 since that stage might stretch the credibility of the cairns model too far @xcite .",
    "so , here we consider the effective range of @xmath29 as follows : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "the charge neutrality condition , @xmath82 can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and consequently , the poisson equation ( [ poisson eq without mu ] ) assumes the following form : @xmath85 we note from ( [ charge neutrality with mu ] ) that @xmath86 must be greater than zero , i.e. , @xmath87 . when @xmath88 , the effect of negatively charged dust grains on dia wave is negligible and so , we restrict @xmath10 by the inequality @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is strictly less than 1 .",
    "to study the arbitrary amplitude time independent diasws and diadls we make all the dependent variables depend only on a single variable @xmath91 , where the mach number @xmath3 is normalized by @xmath58 .",
    "thus in the steady state , ( [ continuity of ions ] ) - ( [ pressure eq ] ) and ( [ poisson eq ] ) can be written as @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 using the boundary conditions , @xmath96 and solving ( [ continuity of ions steady state ] ) - ( [ pressure eq steady state ] ) , we get a quadratic equation for @xmath97 and following the same argument as given in das _",
    "@xcite to find the expression of dust density with exact bounds , we get the following expression of @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath98 where @xmath99 from ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m 2 ] ) , we see that this equation gives both theoretically and numerically correct expression of @xmath52 even when @xmath100 if @xmath101 .    now integrating ( [ poisson eq steady state ] ) with respect to @xmath56 and using the boundary conditions ( [ boundary cond ] ) , we get the following energy integral with @xmath102 as sagdeev potential or pseudo - potential .",
    "@xmath103 where @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is same as @xmath102 , i.e. , the mach number @xmath3 is omitted from the notation @xmath107 when no particular emphasis is put upon it .",
    "the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) can be regarded as the one - dimensional motion of a particle of unit mass whose position is @xmath56 at time @xmath108 with velocity @xmath109 in a potential well @xmath102 . the first term in the energy integral ( [ energy int ] )",
    "can be regarded as the kinetic energy of a particle of unit mass at position @xmath56 and time @xmath108 whereas @xmath102 is the potential energy at that instant . since",
    "kinetic energy is always a non - negative quantity , @xmath110 for the entire motion , i.e. , zero is the maximum value for @xmath102 . again from ( [ energy int ] )",
    ", we find @xmath111 , i.e. the force acting on the particle of unit mass at the position @xmath56 is @xmath112 , where `` @xmath113 '' indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "now , it can be easily checked that @xmath114 , and consequently , the particle is in equilibrium at @xmath115 because the velocity as well as the force acting on the particle at @xmath115 are simultaneously zero .",
    "now if @xmath116 can be made an unstable position of equilibrium , the energy integral can be interpreted as the motion of an oscillatory particle if @xmath117 for some @xmath118 , i.e. , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium then it moves away from its unstable position of equilibrium and it continues its motion until its velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath56 takes the value @xmath119 .",
    "now the force acting on the particle of unit mass at position @xmath120 is @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath123",
    "is directed towards the point @xmath115 if @xmath124 , i.e. , if @xmath125 . on the other hand , for @xmath126 ,",
    "the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath123 is directed towards the point @xmath115 if @xmath127 , i.e. , if @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath128 ( for the positive potential side ) or if @xmath125 ( for the negative potential side ) then the particle reflects back again to @xmath116 . again , if @xmath129 then the velocity @xmath130 as well as the force @xmath131 both are equal to zero at @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium ( @xmath116 ) it moves away from @xmath116 and it continues its motion until the velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath56 takes the value @xmath120 .",
    "however it can not be reflected back again at @xmath116 as the velocity and the force acting on the particle at @xmath120 vanish simultaneously . actually , if @xmath128 ( for @xmath126 ) or if @xmath125 ( for @xmath122 ) the particle takes an infinite long time to move away from the unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "after that it continues its motion until @xmath56 takes the value @xmath119 and again it takes an infinite long time to come back its unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , for the existence of a positive ( negative ) potential solitary wave solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) , we must have the following : ( a ) @xmath115 is the position of unstable equilibrium of the particle , ( b ) @xmath117 , @xmath132 @xmath133 for some @xmath134 @xmath135 , which is nothing but the condition for oscillation of the particle within the interval @xmath136 and ( c ) @xmath137 for all @xmath138 @xmath139 ) , which is the condition to define the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) within the interval @xmath136 . for the existence of a positive ( negative ) potential dl solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) , the conditions ( a ) and ( c ) remain unchanged but here ( b ) has been modified in such a way that the particle can not be reflected again at @xmath116 , i.e. , the condition ( b ) assumes the following form : @xmath140 , @xmath141 for some @xmath134 @xmath142 ) .",

    "@xmath147 now , for @xmath2 to be real and positive , we must have @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "as the effective range of @xmath29 is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath2 is well - defined as a real positive quantity for all @xmath150 and @xmath80 .      consider the existence of a ppsw for some value of @xmath151",
    "therefore , there exists a @xmath126 such that @xmath152 now as @xmath102 is real for @xmath153 we must have @xmath154 , otherwise @xmath155 is not a real quantity .",

    "again let @xmath13 be the maximum value of @xmath3 up to which solitary wave solution can exist . as @xmath159 increases with @xmath3 then @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , @xmath161 defines the largest amplitude ppsw if @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , for the existence of the ppsws , the mach number @xmath3 is restricted by the following inequality : @xmath164 , where @xmath13 is the largest positive root of the equation @xmath165 subject to the condition @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 . now",
    "if at @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) , one can get a ppdl solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) then for the existence of the ppsws , the mach number @xmath3 is restricted by the inequality : @xmath171 and also @xmath172 . on the other hand if @xmath173 , then for the existence of ppsws , the mach number @xmath3 is restricted by the inequality : @xmath171 .",
    "we have seen earlier that @xmath102 is real if @xmath174 , where @xmath159 is strictly positive . for npsws or npdls , we have @xmath175 along with the other conditions stated in section [ sec : physics ] for the existence of npsws or npdls .",
    "as @xmath159 is strictly positive and for npsws or npdls , @xmath176 , the condition @xmath177 is automatically satisfied and consequently , for these two cases @xmath102 is well defined for all @xmath176 without imposing extra condition .",
    "since there is no such restriction on @xmath56 , we can not use the same definition as in the case of ppsws to find the upper bound of mach numbers for the existence of npsws . for the case of npsws , to find an upper limit or upper bound of @xmath3 , up to",
    "which npsw can exist , we shall first of all find a value @xmath178 of @xmath3 for which energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) gives a npdl solution at @xmath30 with amplitude @xmath179 . now if at @xmath30 , @xmath180 is the only root ( double root ) of the equation @xmath181 , i.e. , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , then the npdl solution is the ultimate solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) and in this case , no npsw solution can be obtained if @xmath1 , i.e. , for the occurrence of npsws , the mach number @xmath3 is restricted by the inequality @xmath0 .    on the other hand if there exists an inaccessible simple root @xmath184 of @xmath56 such that @xmath185 , i.e. , @xmath186 along with @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath185 , then there exists a npsw solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) for at least one value of @xmath1 .",
    "hence in the later case double layer solution is unable to restrict the occurrence of npsws for @xmath1 . from this consideration , it is also clear that the occurrence of npsws is restricted by @xmath0 , provided that there exists one and only one double root of the equation @xmath187 for the unknown @xmath188 , otherwise npsws can exist for all @xmath189",

    "fig : sol space amp1](a ) , we see that there does not exist any ppsw along the curve @xmath335 for @xmath336 . so according to the terminology @xmath285 along the curve @xmath335 for @xmath336 . consequently , from inequality ( [ phi_pn ] ) , we have npdl solution at @xmath337 for @xmath335 .",
    "this fact is clear from ( b ) .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated diasws and diadls in a dusty plasma system consisting of adiabatic ions , nonthermal electrons and negatively charged dust grains .",
    "investigations have been made by going through the entire solution space of the energy integral by considering the entire range of the parameters involved in the system .",
    "our aim is to delimit the parameter @xmath29 depending on the nature of existence of diasws and diadls .",
    "therefore , for any physically admissible values of the parameters of the system , specifically , for any value of @xmath10 and any value of @xmath29 , npsw exists for all @xmath4 except @xmath30 , where @xmath2 is the lower bound of mach number @xmath3 , i.e. , solitary wave and/or double layer solutions of the energy integral start to exist for @xmath4 and @xmath178 is the mach number corresponding to a npdl solution .",
    "however , if the parameter @xmath10 exceeds a critical value @xmath31 , ppsws exist for all @xmath338 whenever the mach number lies within the interval @xmath33 , where @xmath13 is the upper bound of @xmath3 which is well - defined only when the system supports ppsws .",
    "therefore , the coexistence of both ppsws and npsws is possible for all @xmath339 whenever @xmath33 , but npsws still exist for @xmath12 .    for nonthermal electrons , npdl starts to occur whenever the nonthermal parameter exceeds a critical value .",
    "however this double layer solution is unable to restrict the occurrence of npsws . as a result ,",
    "two different types of npsws have been observed , in which occurrence of first type of npsw is restricted by @xmath0 whereas the second type npsw exists for all @xmath1 , where @xmath178 is the mach number corresponding to a npdl . a finite jump between the amplitudes of npsws at @xmath340 and at @xmath341 has been observed , where @xmath342 is a sufficiently small positive quantity .",
    "the amplitude of npsw for @xmath1 is much greater than the amplitude of the npdl solution at @xmath30 as well as the amplitude of npsw for @xmath343 , i.e. , there is a jump in amplitudes of the npsws above and below the curve @xmath30 .",
    "however , there is no jump in amplitudes of npsws above and below the curve @xmath255 .    in most of the earlier works ,",
    "dust ion acoustic solitary structures have been investigated with the help of maxwellian velocity distribution function for electrons . however , the dusty plasma with nonthermally / suprathermally distributed electrons observed in a number of heliospheric environments @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present paper gives the complete scenario of dust ion acoustic solitary structures in a dusty plasma system in which lighter species ( electrons ) is nonthermally distributed .",
    "this paper is also helpful for understanding the formation of dust ion acoustic solitary structures from different physical and mathematical aspects .",
