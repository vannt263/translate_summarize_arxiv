    "<S> * resource allocation takes place in various types of real - world complex systems such as urban traffic , social services institutions , economical and ecosystems . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the dynamical process of complex resource allocation can be modeled as _ minority games _ in which the number of resources is limited and agents tend to choose the less used resource based on available information . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous evolution of the resource allocation dynamics , however , often leads to a harmful herding behavior accompanied by strong fluctuations in which a large majority of agents crowd temporarily for a few resources , leaving many others unused . </S>",
    "<S> developing effective control strategies to suppress and eliminate herding is an important but open problem . </S>",
    "<S> here we develop a pinning control method . that the fluctuations of the system consist of intrinsic and systematic components allows us to design a control scheme with separated control variables . </S>",
    "<S> a striking finding is the universal existence of an optimal pinning fraction to minimize the variance of the system , regardless of the pinning patterns and the network topology . we carry out a detailed theoretical analysis to understand the emergence of optimal pinning and to predict the dependence of the optimal pinning fraction on the network topology . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is generally applicable to systems with heterogeneous resource capacities as well as varying control and network topological parameters such as the average degree and the degree distribution exponent . </S>",
    "<S> our work represents a general framework to deal with the broader problem of controlling collective dynamics in complex systems with potential applications in social , economical and political systems . *    </S>",
    "<S> resource allocation is an essential process in many real - world systems such as ecosystems of various sizes , transportation systems ( e.g. , internet , urban traffic grids , rail and flight networks ) , public service providers ( e.g. , marts , hospitals , and schools ) , and social and economic organizations ( e.g. , banks and financial markets ) . the underlying system that supports resource allocation often contains a large number of interacting components or agents on a hierarchy of scales , and there are multiple resources available for each agent . as a result , complex behaviors are expected to emerge ubiquitously in the dynamical evolution of resource allocation . in particular , in a typical situation , agents or individuals possess similar capabilities in information processing and decision making , and they share the common goal of pursuing as high payoffs as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions among the agents and their desire to maximize payoffs in competing for limited resources can lead to vast complexity in the system dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> given resource - allocation system that exhibits complex dynamics , a defining virtue of optimal performance is that the available resources are exploited evenly or uniformly by all agents in the system . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , an undesired or even catastrophic behavior is the emergence of herding , in which a vast majority of agents concentrate on a few resources , leaving many other resources idle or unused  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this behavior is not controlled , the few focused resources would be depleted , possibly directing agents to a different but still small set of resources . from a systems point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this can lead to a cascading type of failures as resources are being depleted one after another , eventually resulting in a catastrophic breakdown of the system on a global scale . in this paper , we analyze and test an effective strategy to control herding dynamics in complex resource - allocation systems .    a universal paradigm to model and understand the interactions and dynamical evolutions in many real world systems is complex adaptive systems  @xcite , among which minority game ( mg )  @xcite stands out as a particularly pertinent framework for resource allocation . </S>",
    "<S> mg dynamics was introduced by challet and zhang to address the classic el farol bar - attendance problem conceived by arthur  @xcite . in an mg system , each agent makes choice ( e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , to attend a bar or to stay at home ) based on available global information from the previous round of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the agents who pick the minority strategy are rewarded , and those belonging to the majority group are punished due to limited resources . </S>",
    "<S> the mg dynamics has been studied extensively in the past  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to analyze , understand , and exploit the mg dynamics , there are two theoretical approaches : mean field approximation and boolean dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the mean field approach was mainly developed by researchers from the statistical - physics community to cast the mg problem in the general framework of non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite . in the boolean dynamics , for any agent </S>",
    "<S> , detailed information about the other agents that it interacts with is assumed to be available , and the agent responds accordingly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both approaches can lead to `` better than random '' performance in resource utilization . </S>",
    "<S> however , herding behavior in which many agents take identical action  @xcite can also take place , which has been extensively studied and recognized as one important factor contributing to the origin of complexity that leads to enhanced fluctuations and , consequently , to significant degradation in efficiency  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the control strategy we analyze in this paper is the pinning method that has been studied in controlling the collective dynamics , such as synchronization , in complex networks  @xcite . for the general </S>",
    "<S> setting of pinning control , the two key parameters are the `` pinning fraction , '' the fraction of agents chosen to hold a fixed strategy , and the `` pinning pattern , '' the configuration of plus or minus strategies assigned to the pinned agents . </S>",
    "<S> our previous work  @xcite treated the special case of two resources of identical capacities , where the pinning pattern was such that the probabilities of agents pinned to positive or negative strategies ( to be defined later ) are equal . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a more realistic model setting and articulate a general mathematic control framework . </S>",
    "<S> a striking finding is that biased pinning control pattern can lead to an optimal pinning fraction for a variety of network topologies , so that the system efficiency can be improved remarkably . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theoretical analysis based on the mean - field approximation to understand the non - monotonic behavior of the system efficiency about the optimal pinning fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the dependence of the optimal fraction on the topological features of the system , such as the average degree and heterogeneity , and obtain a theoretical upper bound of the system efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are validated with extensive numerical simulations . </S>",

    "<S> similar to the mg dynamics , only the agents belonging to the _ global minority _ group are rewarded by one unit of payoff . as a result , the profit of the system is equal to the number of agents selecting the resource with attendance less than the accommodating capacity , which constitute the global - minority group . </S>",

    "<S> a boolean system has two states ( a binary state system ) , in which agents make decision according to the local information from immediate neighbors . </S>",

    "<S> each agent receives inputs from its neighboring agents and updates its state according to the boolean function , a function that generates either @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the inputs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> realistically , for any agent , global information about the minority choice from all other agents at the preceding time step may not be available . under this circumstance , the agent attempts to decide the global minority choice based on neighbors previous strategies . to be concrete , we assume  @xcite that agent @xmath12 with @xmath13 neighbors chooses @xmath0 at time step @xmath14 with the probability @xmath15,\\ ] ] and chooses @xmath1 with the probability @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , are the numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 neighbors of @xmath12 at time step @xmath7 , with @xmath19 . the expressions of probabilities , however , are valid only under the assumption that the two resources have the _ same _ accommodating capacity , i.e. , @xmath20 . in real - world resource allocation systems , typically we have @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> suppose we have @xmath23 for agent @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , rationality demands a stronger preference to the resource @xmath0 ( i.e. , with a higher probability ) . to investigate the issues associated with the control of realistic boolean dynamics , we define @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the response function of each agent to its local environment @xmath26 , i.e. , the local neighbor s configuration with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : interaction ] ) satisfies @xmath35 , which leads to the eigenstate of @xmath25 as @xmath36 the rational response ( @xmath25 ) of agents to nonidentical accommodation capacities of resources will lead to the equality @xmath37 , i.e. , the stable fraction of the agent densities in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is simply the ratio of the capacities . </S>",
    "<S> the elements of @xmath25 can then be defined accordingly using this ratio and the condition @xmath38 , which characterizes a stronger preference to the resource with a larger capacity . for the specific case of identical - capacity resources </S>",

    "<S> a smaller value of @xmath44 indicates that the resource allocation is more optimal . </S>",
