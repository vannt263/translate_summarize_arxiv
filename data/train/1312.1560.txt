    "nanoparticles ( nps ) are tiny particles of matter with diameters typically ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers which possess distinctive properties",
    ". these particles , larger than typical molecules but too small to be considered bulk solids , can exhibit hybrid physical and chemical properties which are absent in the corresponding bulk material .",
    "the particles in their nano regime exhibit special properties which are not found in the bulk properties , for example , catalysis [ @xcite ] , electronic properties [ @xcite ] and size and shape dependent optical properties [ @xcite ] , which have potential ramifications in medicinal applications and optical devices [ @xcite ] .",
    "the current challenge is to develop capabilities to understand and synthesize materials at the nano stage , instead of the bulk stage .    among",
    "the various nps studied , colloidal gold ( au ) nps were found to have tremendous importance due to their unique optical , electronic and molecular - recognition properties [ @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "for example , selective optical filters , bio - sensors , are among the many applications that use optical properties of gold nps related to surface plasmon resonances which depend strongly on the particle shape and size [ @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , there is an enormous interest in exploiting gold nps in various biomedical applications since their scale is similar to that of biological molecules ( e.g. , proteins , dna ) and structures ( e.g. , viruses and bacteria ) [ @xcite ] .    in recent years it has become possible to investigate the dependency of chemical and physical properties on size and shape of nps , due to transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images . @xcite and @xcite , respectively , showed size and shape dependence of synthesis and catalysis reaction where they observed different rates .",
    "they also observed that circular gold nps are better catalysts compared to triangular nps for a specific reaction .",
    "the development of new pathways for the systematic manipulation of size and shape over different dimensions is thus critical for obtaining optimal properties of these materials . in this paper",
    "we develop novel , model - based image analysis tools that classify and characterize the images of the nps which provide their morphological characteristics to enable a better understanding of the underlying physical and chemical properties .",
    "once we are able to accurately characterize the shapes of nps by using this method , we can develop different techniques to control these shapes to extract useful material properties .",
    "substantial work in estimating the closed contours of objects in an image has been done by @xcite , among others .",
    "imaging processing tools , especially for cell segmentation , also exist ; for instance , imagej [ @xcite ] is a tool recommended by the national institute of health ( nih ) .",
    "however , the features of the data we are dealing with are quite different from those considered in the literature reviewed , as there are various degrees of overlapping of the nps differing in shapes and sizes , as well as a significant number of nps lying along the image boundaries .",
    "high - level statistical image analysis techniques model an image as a collection of discrete objects and are used for object recognition [ @xcite ] . in images with object overlapping , bayesian approaches have been preferred over maximum likelihood estimators ( mle ) .",
    "the unrestricted mle approaches tend to contain clusters of identical objects allowing one object to sit on the top of the other , whereas the bayesian approaches mitigate this problem by penalizing the overlapping as part of the prior specification [ @xcite ] , offering flexibility over controlling the overlapping or the touching .    in @xcite , a bayesian approach using a prior which forbids objects to overlap",
    "completely is proposed to capture predetermined shapes ( mushrooms , circular in shape ) .",
    "inference is carried out by finding the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimates and the prior parameters are chosen by simulation experience , in effect , fixing the parameters that define the penalty terms .",
    "@xcite also used a similar framework to handle the unknown number of objects but introduce polygonal templates to model the objects .",
    "however , their application is restricted to cell detection problems , where the objects do not overlap but barely touch each other and the method works more like a segmentation technique than as a classification technique . moreover , the success of this approach depends on prior parameters , which are assumed known throughout the simulation .",
    "@xcite used the same model except that they considered elliptical templates instead of polygonal templates and applied their method to similar cell images .",
    "all the above methods take advantage of the marked point process ( mpp ) , in particular , the area interaction process prior ( aipp ) , or any other prior that penalizes the overlapping or touching , which we explain later in the paper .    since the structure of the data we are analyzing is different from the literature",
    ", we adapt object representation strategies discussed above to the problem at hand .",
    "when we refer to a shape , we refer to a family of geometrical objects which share certain features , for example , an isosceles and a right triangle both belong to the triangle family .",
    "there are five types of possible shapes of the nps in our problem .",
    "the scientific reason is that the final shape of the particle is dominated by the potential energy and the growth kinetics .",
    "there is a balance between surface energy and bulk energy once a nucleus is formed .",
    "the arrangement of atoms in a crystal determines those energies such that only one of these specified shapes can be formed .",
    "we use similar scientific reasons to construct shape templates .",
    "these templates are determined by the parameters which vary from shape to shape .",
    "since there is a difference in the degree of overlapping from image to image , we assume that the parameters of the aipp are unknown and ought to be inferred .",
    "this leads to a hierarchical model setting where the prior distribution has an intractable normalizing constant . as a result ,",
    "the posterior is doubly intractable and we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) framework to carry out the inference .",
    "simulating from distributions with doubly intractable normalizing constants has received much attention in the recent literature , but most of these methods consider the normalizing constant in the likelihood and not in the hierarchical prior ; @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others . in this paper",
    ", we borrow the idea of @xcite , which is a modified version of the reweighting mixtures given in @xcite and @xcite , which can deal with doubly intractable normalizing constants in the hierarchical prior as well .",
    "the mcmc algorithm used can be described as a two - step mcmc algorithm .",
    "we first sample the parameters from the pseudo posterior distribution which is a part of the posterior that does not contain the aipp normalizing constant  and then an additional monte carlo metropolis  hastings ( mcmh ) step that accounts for this normalizing constant .",
    "sampling from the pseudo posterior distribution is also quite challenging . inferring",
    "the unknown number of objects with undetermined shapes is a complex task .",
    "we propose reversible jumps mcmc ( rj - mcmc ) type of moves to handle both the tasks [ @xcite ] .",
    "birth , death , split and merge moves have been designed based on the work of @xcite .",
    "we also propose rj - mcmc moves to swap ( switch ) the shape of an object .",
    "using the above mentioned computational scheme , we obtain the posterior distributions for all the parameters which characterize the nps : number , shape , size , center , rotation , mean intensity , etc .",
    "owing to the model specification and the computational engine for inferring the model parameters , our approach extracts the morphological information of nps , detects nps laying on the boundaries , quantities uncertainty in shape classification , and successfully deals with the object overlapping , when most of the existing shape analysis methods fail .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] describes the tem images , section [ sec3 ] deals with the object specification procedure , section [ sec4 ] describes the model specification , section [ sec5 ] describes the mcmc algorithm , section [ sec6 ] describes a simulation study and section [ sec7 ] applies the method to the real data .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "in this paper we analyze a mixture of gold nps in a water solution . in order to analyze the morphological characteristics , nps",
    "are sampled from this solution onto a very thin layer of carbon film .",
    "after the water evaporates , the two - dimensional morphology of nps is measured using an electron microscopy such as tem . in our case ,",
    "a jeol @xmath0 high resolution tem operating at @xmath1 kv accelerating voltage was used , which has @xmath2 nm of point resolution .",
    "the tem shoots a beam of electrons onto the materials embedded with nps and captures the electron wave interference by using a detector on the other side of the material specimen , resulting in an image .",
    "the electrons can not penetrate through the nps , resulting in a darker area in that part of the image .",
    "the output from this application will be an eight bit gray scale image where darker parts indicate the presence of a nanoparticle .",
    "the gray scale intensity is varying as an integer between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "refer to figure [ fig1 ] for examples of tem images .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  [ fig5](b ) . similarly , we show the split move in action using example 2 .",
    "snapshots taken at the @xmath5th and the @xmath6th mcmc iterations for example 2 are given in figure [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "not only an obvious split step has occurred but also we can see the different deviations of the boundaries which are related to the object representation parameters .",
    "all the simulations and the algorithms were implemented in matlab , running on a xeon dual core processor clocking @xmath7 ghz with @xmath8 gb ram .",
    "mcmc chains are initialized by using classical image processing tools .",
    "all the five templates are randomly assigned to complete template specification .",
    "the simulation time for the two examples is approximately two hours for @xmath9 iterations .",
    "convergence of the chains was observed within the first @xmath10 iterations .",
    "however , we point out that the computational time of the proposed method depends on the size of the image , the number of the objects and the complexity of overlapping , and burn - in time which strongly depends on the initial state of the chain .    in order to accelerate quick mixing , we take advantage of several classical image processing tools .",
    "notable among these are the watershed image segmentation and certain morphological operator based image filtering techniques such as erosion , dilation etc .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "for example , we use watershed segmentation to decompose the image into subimages that have approximately nonoverlapping regions ( in terms of objects ) .",
    "a repeated application of the erosion operator on the subimages , in conjunction with connected - component analysis and dilation operation , gives us an approximate count of number of objects and their morphological aspects .",
    "such information can be used to initialize the chains and to construct proposal distributions required by the mcmc sampler .",
    "in addition , the region - based approach allows one to exploit distributed and parallel computing concepts to reduce simulation time and make the algorithm scalable .",
    "further details are not presented here since morphological preprocessing is not the subject of the present work .",
    "we point out above that choices affect simulation time and may improve mixing but otherwise are not necessary for our proposed method to work .",
    "in addition , simulation time and effort required by the mcmc method required are relatively small compared to the time , effort and resources required to produce the nps and finally obtain the tem images which can exceed weeks .",
    "using the mcmc samples , we can obtain the distribution of the particle size , which is characterized by the area of the nanoparticle and the distribution of the particle shape .",
    "the aspect ratio , defined as the length of the perimeter of a boundary divided by the area of the same boundary , can be derived from the combination of size , shape and the pure parameters .",
    "the statistics of size , shape and aspect ratio are widely adopted in nano science and engineering to characterize the morphology of nps , and are believed to strongly affect the physical or chemical properties of the nps [ @xcite ] .",
    "for example , the aspect ratio is considered as an important parameter relevant to certain macro - level material properties because physical and chemical reactions are believed to frequently occur on the surface of molecules so that as the aspect ratio of a nanoparticle gets larger , those reactions are more active .    we apply our method to three different tem images .",
    "the parameters that maximize the posterior distribution ( map ) obtained from the ( mcmc ) are presented in detail .",
    "our classification results of particular type are verified by our collaborators with domain expertise ; this manual verification appears the only valid way for the time being .",
    "more than @xmath11 of the nps in those images are classified correctly .",
    "this also includes the particles in the boundary as well as having overlapping regions . for completely observed objects ,",
    "there is almost @xmath12 correct classification .",
    "we start our application with the image in figure [ fig1](a ) .",
    "morphological image processing operations , such as watershed transformation and erosion , can be used to get an approximate count of the number of nps in the model [ @xcite ] .",
    "they also can be used in initializing the mcmc chains and in constructing proposal distributions required by the mcmc sampler .",
    "the morphological image processing we used in this dissertation has the following steps : ( 1 ) image filtering and segmentation , ( 2 ) determining the number of objects , ( 3 ) estimating location , size and rotation parameters .",
    "we first transform the image from grey to a binary image and then apply watershed transformation to partition the image into subimages . in each binary subimage",
    "we apply erosion and dilation operations to find initial values for the parameters inside of each subimage .",
    "because this morphological processing is not the subject of the present work , it is not presented in more detail .",
    "after the initial values are obtained from the preprocessing step , all five templates are randomly assigned for starting template specifications . from the mcmc sampler described in section [ postmcmc ]",
    "we obtain a random sample of the posterior distribution for all the parameters which characterize the nps , namely , the _ shape _ @xmath13 , the _ size _",
    "@xmath14 , the _ rotation _",
    "@xmath15 , the _ random pure parameter _",
    "@xmath16 , the _ mean _ intensity @xmath17 and the _ variance _ @xmath18 .",
    "we use this posterior sample for inferring the model parameters and extracting the morphological information of nps with uncertainty in shape size and classification . to better present our results",

    "it is clear that the mean intensity is different from nanoparticle to nanoparticle , justifying our assumption of different means in  ( [ equ3 ] ) .",
