    "in addition to agns , high energy cosmic tau neutrinos may also be produced in several currently envisaged other cosmologically distant astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "for some possible effects of neutrino mixing other than the flavour one on high energy cosmic tau neutrino flux , see @xcite . for prospects of observations of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos other than the double shower technique , see @xcite .",
    "the present study is particularly useful as several under water / ice high energy neutrino telescopes are now at their rather advanced stages of development and deployment @xcite .",
    "i start in section 2 with a brief description of possibility of production of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos relative to electron and muon neutrinos and discuss in some detail the effect of three flavour neutrino mixing on their subsequent propagation and further discuss the prospects for their detection through double shower events . in section 3",
    ", i summarize the results .",
    "high energy cosmic tau neutrinos may either mainly be produced in @xmath2 or in @xmath3 collisions in a cosmologically distant environment .    in @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "high energy @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mainly produced through the resonant reaction @xmath6 .",
    "the same collisions will give rise to a greatly suppressed high energy @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) flux ( @xmath9 ) mainly through the reaction @xmath10 .",
    "in @xmath11 collisions , the @xmath7 flux may be obtained through @xmath12 . the relatively small cross - section for @xmath13 production together with the low branching ratio into @xmath7 implies that the @xmath7 flux in @xmath11 collisions is also suppressed up to 5 orders of magnitude relative to @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 fluxes .",
    "thus , both in @xmath2 and in @xmath11 collisions , the intrinsically produced tau neutrino flux is expected to be rather quite small , typically a factor less than @xmath14 relative to electron and muon neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "matter effects on vacuum neutrino flavour oscillations are relevant if @xmath15 . using @xmath16 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , it follows that matter effects are absent for @xmath17 ev@xmath1 .",
    "matter effects are not expected to be important in the neutrino production regions around agn and will not be further discussed here .    in the framework of three flavour analysis ,",
    "the flavour precession probability from @xmath18 to @xmath19 neutrino flavour is @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the 3@xmath243 mns mixing matrix and will be used in usual notation with the standard parameterization for vanishing @xmath25 and cp violating phase @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the distance between the source and the detector .",
    "currently , the atmospheric muon and solar electron neutrino deficits can be explained with oscillations among three active neutrinos @xcite . for this , typically , @xmath29 ev@xmath1 and @xmath30 for the explanation of atmospheric muon neutrino deficit , whereas for the explanation of solar electron neutrino deficit , we may have @xmath31 ev@xmath1 and @xmath30 [ just so solution ] or @xmath32 ev@xmath1 and @xmath33 [ sma ( msw ) ] or @xmath32 ev@xmath1 and @xmath30 [ lma ( msw ) ] .    in the above explanations ,",
    "the total range of @xmath34 is @xmath35 ev@xmath36 irrespective of neutrino flavour .",
    "the typical energy span relevant for possible flavour identification for high energy cosmic neutrinos is @xmath37gev@xmath38 in which currently the neutrino flux from cores of agns dominate .",
    "taking a typical distance between the agn and our galaxy as @xmath39 mpc ( where 1 pc @xmath40 m ) , the @xmath41 term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) vanishes and so eq . ( 1 ) reduces to    @xmath42    it is assumed here that no relatively dense objects exist between the agn and the earth so as to effect significantly this oscillations pattern .",
    "the @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is independent of not only @xmath34 but also @xmath44 .",
    "let me denote by @xmath45 , the intrinsic high energy cosmic neutirno fluxes .",
    "for simplicity , i take their ratios as @xmath46 . in order to estimate the final flux ratios on earth ,",
    "let me introduce a 3@xmath243 matrix of vacuum flavour precession probabilities such that    @xmath47    the explicit form for the matrix @xmath48 in case of just so flavour oscillations as solution to solar neutrino problem along with the solution to atmospheric neutrino deficit in terms of @xmath5 to @xmath7 oscillations with maximal depth is    @xmath49    using eq . ( 4 ) and eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we note that @xmath50 at the level of @xmath51 .",
    "also , the unitarity conditions for @xmath52 are satisfied .",
    "the same flux ratio is obtained in remaining two cases .",
    "thus , essentially independent of the oscillation solution for solar neutrino problem , i have @xmath53 .",
    "this provides some prospects for possible detection of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos .",
    "the down ward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos reaching close to the surface of the detector may undergo a charged current deep inelastic scattering with nuclei inside / near the detector and produce a tau lepton in addition to a hadronic shower .",
    "this tau lepton traverses a distance , on average proportional to its energy , before it decays back into a tau neutrino and a second shower most often induced by decay hadrons .",
    "the second shower is expected to carry about twice as much energy as the first and such double shower signals are commonly referred to as a double bangs . as tau leptons are not expected to have further relevant interactions ( with high energy loss ) in their decay time scale , the two showers should be separated by a clean @xmath54-like track @xcite .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.5 in    the calculation of down ward going contained but separable double shower event rate for a typical km@xmath1 surface area under water / ice neutrino telescope can be carried out by replacing the muon range expression with the tauon one and then subtracting it from the linear size of a typical high energy neutrino telescope in the event rate formula while using the expected @xmath7 flux spectrum given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) . here",
    ", i confine myself by mentioning that the expected number of contained but separable double showers induced by down ward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos for @xmath55 gev may be @xmath56/yr@xmath57sr , essentially irrespective of solution of solar neutrino problem , if one uses the @xmath51 from ref . @xcite as an example . at this energy ,",
    "the two showers initiated by the down ward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos are well separated ( see fig .",
    "1 ) such that the amplitude of the second shower is essentially 2 times the first shower .",
    "intrinsically , the flux of high energy cosmic tau neutrinos is quite small , typically being @xmath58 from , for instance , cosmologically distant cores of active galactic nuclei .    \\2 .",
    "because of vacuum neutrino flavour oscillations , this ratio can be greatly enhanced . in the context of three flavour neutrino mixing scheme which can accomodate the oscillation solutions to solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits , the final flux ratio of high energy cosmic neutrinos on earth is @xmath59 .",
    "this enhancement in high energy cosmic tau neutrino flux may lead to the possibility of its detection in km@xmath1 surface area under water / ice high energy neutrino telescopes . for @xmath60/gev @xmath38 , the down ward going high energy cosmic tau neutrinos may produce a double shower signature because of charged current deep inelastic scattering followed by a subsequent hadronic decay of associated tau lepton .",
