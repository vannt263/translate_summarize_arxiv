    "wall slip is ubiquitous in flows of complex fluids and plays a key role in numerous situations ranging from turbulent drag reduction to extrusion processes @xcite .",
    "it denotes a situation where the fluid velocity @xmath12 in the vicinity of a boundary differs from the velocity @xmath13 of the boundary itself , and often originates from a chemical or physical mismatch between the constituents of the fluid and that of the wall .",
    "such apparent discontinuity in velocity at a boundary reflects the existence of a thin and highly sheared region adjacent to the wall where the viscosity is much smaller than in the bulk material @xcite .",
    "although historically described as a mere artifact , wall slip appears as an intrinsic feature of complex fluids that has been reported in polymeric fluids @xcite as well as in soft glassy materials such as colloidal suspensions @xcite , foams @xcite , emulsions @xcite , microgels @xcite , attractive gels @xcite , etc . moreover , wall slip is often non - trivially coupled to the bulk dynamics of complex fluids , especially during the yielding transition where it may even govern the nature of the subsequent steady - state flow @xcite .",
    "physical insights into wall slip are generally gained from the scaling of the slip velocity @xmath2 with the stress at the wall @xmath3 .",
    "more specifically for particulate suspensions below jamming , the particle deformability does not play a key role and slip velocities scale roughly linearly with @xmath3 @xcite . in jammed particulate assemblies , however , the situation is much more subtle as the material exhibits a yield stress @xmath8 below which it can not flow in the bulk .",
    "the main goal of the present rapid communication is to clarify the slip behavior of a jammed suspension of soft particles driven above the yield stress . indeed in this case",
    "@xmath6 has been reported to increase as a quadratic function of @xmath3 in concentrated emulsions and microgels @xcite while other experiments on similar samples rather led to a linear scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath3 @xcite .    therefore despite a large body of work on wall slip , the key parameters controlling the scaling of @xmath6 in a dense , yielded suspension are still unknown .",
    "one of these parameters is the packing fraction which effect on slip has been scarcely investigated .",
    "here we focus on a suspension of thermoresponsive poly(@xmath14-isopropylacrylamide ) particles that allows us to explore the slip behavior of a suspension at various packing fractions in a single set of experiments , from a dilute system up to a jammed assembly of soft particles .",
    "extensive rheological experiments coupled to velocimetry demonstrate that the slip velocity scales as a power - law on both sides of the jamming transition . for low packing fractions we recover @xmath15 with @xmath16 , while above jamming and for stresses larger than the yield stress , @xmath6 follows a power law of the viscous stress , i.e. @xmath17 . furthermore the exponent @xmath5 increases continuously from @xmath10 to @xmath11 as the packing fraction is increased .",
    "this is confirmed by revisiting formerly published data on emulsions and microgels .",

    "@xmath8 where the material is solidlike and flows as a plug .",
    "indeed , in microgels and emulsions for @xmath96 , @xmath6 was shown to increase either linearly or quadratically , i.e. @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the stress below which the material sticks to the boundaries , with @xmath10 or 2 depending on the nature of the interactions with the wall @xcite .",
    "our results show that for @xmath99 the apparent yield stress @xmath98 is replaced by the bulk yield stress @xmath8 and that the exponent @xmath5 depends on the packing fraction .",
    "the latter result can be understood as follows : at low temperatures compared to the lcst , the exponent @xmath11 can be interpreted as the result of a force balance on compressed particles experiencing hertz - like deformation and lubrication forces with the walls , as first proposed for plug flows in @xcite . at intermediate temperatures closer to the lcst ,",
    "such a framework is probably no longer valid as the microgels may experience not only lubrication forces but also cooperative rearrangements thanks to both the lower volume fraction and the non - zero local shear rate .",
    "let us indeed recall that the material is sheared in the bulk for all data reported here , whatever the shear rate or the temperature .",
    "the lesser importance of the lubrication interactions for decreasing packing fractions could thus account for the decrease of the exponent @xmath5 , and for the transition to dilute - like behavior of the suspension , although the packing fraction is still above jamming .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that slip velocities in yield stress fluids made of soft jammed particles and sheared in the bulk increase as power laws of the viscous stress over a range of temperatures that encompasses both sides of the jamming transition .",
    "therefore @xmath6 can be written under the single form @xmath100^{p(\\phi)}$ ] with @xmath78 and @xmath16 below jamming and where both @xmath8 and @xmath5 are increasing functions of @xmath9 above jamming .",
    "these results hint at a link between the bulk behavior of the material and the slip at the wall , as also evidenced by some of the nonlinear velocity profiles reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . whether such nonlinearity should be attributed to some flow - concentration coupling @xcite or to long - range effects of the boundaries associated with non - local effects @xcite remains an open issue . in any case a complete description of the present data shall certainly involve some coupling between bulk and boundary effects .",
    "such a point of view contrasts with the interpretation of wall slip in foams , where slippage is mainly controlled by the physics at the boundaries and decoupled from bulk properties @xcite . clearly",
    "a more detailed study of boundary - driven vs bulk - driven effects involving wall slip remains to be conducted by collecting data on various soft glassy materials including foams .",
    "finally , our work paves the way for a more realistic modeling of flows of dense suspensions in the presence of slip .",
