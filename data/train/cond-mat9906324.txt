    "the kondo effect , that is the low - temperature screening of dynamical quantum defects in metals by band electrons , has been extensively studied during the past thirty years and is by now well understood ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  ) .",
    "the continuing interest in the problem is motivated chiefly by the search for novel realizations of the effect  @xcite .",
    "for example , _ local _ non - fermi - liquid ground states have been predicted theoretically  @xcite for certain types of dynamical defects coupled to band electrons .",
    "the behavior of these impurities is sometimes invoked in efforts to understand the non - fermi - liquid behavior of strongly correlated systems , such as heavy fermion materials and high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties encountered in the interpretation of experimental data from novel kondo systems is the fact that defects with internal degrees of freedom very seldom represent the only type of disorder in the system",
    ". more often , a considerable number of random static defects affecting band electrons are also present .",
    "scattering of electrons on this static disorder may alter the experimental signature of the kondo effect  @xcite , sometimes masking genuine non - fermi - liquid behavior , or , vice versa , possibly mimicking it in fermi - liquid systems  @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect requires that at least two internal states of the impurity be degenerate or , at least , that their energy difference be much smaller than the kondo temperature @xmath0 . barring the cases of accidental degeneracy between the states of the dynamical impurity",
    ", degeneracy occurs as a consequence of a symmetry , _",
    "e. g. _ , invariance under time - reversal transformation in the case of the magnetic one - channel kondo effect .",
    "accordingly , the possible types of disorder can be separated into two classes , depending on whether disorder destroys the relevant symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "a typical example of the first class is a dilute magnetic alloy with a finite concentration of non - magnetic defects . assuming that the charge state of the magnetic impurity does not change as a result of the interaction with conduction electrons ( thus excluding the mixed - valence regime of the anderson model ) , potential scattering on static disorder does not involve the degree of freedom of conduction electrons which is coupled to the magnetic impurity  their spin .",
    "the hamiltonian remains invariant under time reversal , and the spin states of the impurity are degenerate even in the presence of disorder .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath0 , on the other hand , is affected by potential scattering of electrons .",
    "the nature of the ground state in systems of this type has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another example of such symmetry - preserving disorder is given by spin - orbit scattering  @xcite in magnetic kondo systems .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is also invariant under time reversal , and kramers theorem ensures that each orbital state of conduction electrons is doubly degenerate , so their coupling to magnetic impurities does not lift the degeneracy of impurity states .",
    "an entirely different situation is encountered when scattering on static defects breaks the relevant symmetry .",
    "kondo coupling between the band electrons and the dynamic defect then leads to symmetry - breaking contributions to the self - energy of the dynamic defect .",
    "the frequency - independent part of these contributions can be reinterpreted as an extra term in the _ bare _ hamiltonian of the dynamic defect , and the difference between its eigenvalues ( the energy difference between the `` up '' and `` down '' states of the defect ) is an effective splitting @xmath1 .",
    "being induced by random scattering , the splitting itself is a random quantity .",
    "this type of model was studied , for example , in ref .  , where the _ average _ splitting induced by broken time - reversal invariance due to the combined effect of random spin - orbit scattering and weak magnetic field was computed .",
    "a similar model has been encountered in the study of internal magnetic field distributions in spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "the present study of models of this type has been motivated in part by the discussion in ref .   of different theoretical interpretations of zero - bias anomalies in cu / si : n / cu nanoconstrictions  @xcite .",
    "the zero - bias anomalies first reported in ref .   were observed in nanoconstrictions formed by etching a bowl - shaped cavity in an insulating @xmath2 substrate before covering both sides with vacuum - deposited cu films .",
    "the anomalies are characterized by a @xmath3 dip in conductance @xmath4 at small bias @xmath5 , a corresponding @xmath6 temperature dependence of conductance at @xmath7 , and , more generally , a scaling function of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "these features were interpreted in refs .",
    "( see also ref .   for additional experimental results and ref .",
    "for a comprehensive review ) as consistent with the scaling properties at low temperatures of the two - channel kondo model  @xcite .",
    "the observed absence of zeeman splitting led to a conclusion  @xcite that a non - magnetic realization of the two - channel kondo model of the type suggested by vladr and zawadowski  @xcite might be responsible for the observed anomaly .    the two - channel kondo model , first proposed in ref .",
    "( see also ref .   for an extensive review ) to classify magnetic properties of rare earth materials , is characterized by doubling of the degrees of freedom of conduction electrons as compared to the usual one - channel case , while the dynamic impurity is still a `` spin - up , spin - down '' doublet .",
    "in other words , each orbital state of conduction electrons acquires , in addition to its spin , an extra label , `` flavor '' , which is silent in the sense that the scattering on the dynamic impurity conserves the flavor quantum number .",
    "even so , the strongly correlated ground state of this model has been predicted to exhibit unusual and rather distinctive scaling properties , markedly different from the fermi - liquid - like ground - state properties of ordinary kondo impurities .    in the original model proposed in ref .  , the flavor degrees of freedom were constructed out of different angular momentum states of conduction electrons .",
    "subsequently , it was proposed in a series of papers by vladr and zawadowski  @xcite that an _ effective _ two - channel kondo model may emerge in an entirely different context , where the roles of orbital angular momentum and spin of conduction electrons are interchanged .",
    "the role of a dynamic impurity in such non - magnetic realizations of the kondo effect is assumed to be played by a two - level system ( tls )  an atom or a group of atoms tunneling between two nearly degenerate states .",
    "if transitions between the two states of the tls involve a transfer of charge , the transition amplitude becomes dependent on the density of conduction electrons via the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "the parity of electronic states with respect to the center of the spatially extended defect becomes the active degree of freedom ",
    "`` pseudospin '' .",
    "the physical spin assumes the role of the silent `` flavor '' degree of freedom , providing two independent channels ( in the absence of spin scattering ) for the screening of the dynamic impurity  @xcite .",
    "such tls may be formed accidentally in a strained glassy material  @xcite , or as a result of a jahn - teller effect  @xcite , and tls have also been conjectured to occur at interfaces  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the non - fermi - liquid properties of the ground state in this model have been invoked in the study of dephasing rate of conduction electrons in disordered metals  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy between the two states of the tls based on pseudospin symmetry is a crucial precondition for two - channel kondo screening and the formation of the non - fermi - liquid ground state . in practice",
    "this degeneracy is almost always expected to be lifted because the pseudospin , corresponding to parity about the center of the tls , is not in general a conserved quantity , and , in particular , is not conserved by ordinary potential scattering .",
    "this feature of the orbital two - channel kondo model has to be contrasted with magnetic kondo models where the relevant symmetry is time - reversal invariance , which is broken only in special circumstances , _",
    "e.g. _ by an applied magnetic field or magnetic disorder .",
    "therefore , an analysis of the magnitude of disorder - induced splittings of two - level systems is essential in evaluating the consistency of the two - channel kondo interpretation of the zero - bias anomalies of refs .  .",
    "most of the previous theoretical work on this subject  @xcite has been concentrated on computing the second moment of the random splittings .",
    "a calculation of @xmath10 induced by white - noise potential scattering was reported in ref .  .",
    "it was argued there that even small amounts of disorder may lead to large splittings between the energy levels of the tls , thus effectively stopping the kondo screening at temperatures higher than @xmath0 .",
    "however , the distributions of splittings tend to be very asymmetrical so that their moments are not representative of the typical values .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of the full distribution function is necessary to understand how the splittings of an ensemble of defects may affect the scaling behavior of conductance .",
    "it should be remarked that there is no direct evidence for the existence of tls in the nanoconstrictions studied in the experiments of refs .  .",
    "it is precisely the match between the experimental scaling of conductance and that predicted theoretically for two - channel kondo systems that is the main argument in favor of the two - channel kondo interpretation of the data .",
    "the theoretical scaling functions used for this purpose in refs .   were derived under the assumption that no disorder other than the tls themselves is present , and thus it is of considerable interest to understand how these scaling functions may be changed by realistic amounts of static disorder .    in this paper",
    "we study distribution functions of splittings for two models : ( i ) isotropic magnetic kondo impurities in a spin glass environment , and ( ii ) atomic tls in an environment of static defects inducing potential scattering . in both cases",
    "the disorder is modeled by an array of randomly located point scatterers .",
    "the magnetic model may be realized if a dilute solution of weakly coupled magnetic impurities undergoes kondo screening in a spin - glass environment , formed , for example , by a more concentrated solution of more strongly coupled magnetic impurities .",
    "the result for the distribution of splittings in this case reproduces the distribution of internal fields in spin glasses derived earlier in ref .  .",
    "we also analyze the effects of higher - order terms in the kondo coupling which can not be reduced to rkky - type expressions .",
    "these terms are shown to lead to a finite renormalization of the small-@xmath1 portion of the distribution functions , while their effect on the large-@xmath1 tail is negligible .",
    "a similar analysis is performed for the distribution of splittings of atomic tls .",
    "the magnitude of the splittings obtained here should be viewed as a lower bound , since only effects of electronic disorder are taken into account , _",
    "i.e. _ , we assume that in the absence of such disorder the two states of the tls are degenerate  @xcite .    using the distribution of splittings",
    ", we derive the temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance of a metallic sample containing an ensemble of tls . on this basis , we re - analyze the two - channel kondo interpretation of the zero - bias anomalies  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed scaling behavior and that derived in the present work presents , in our view , a significant challenge for the two - channel kondo interpretation .",
    "furthermore , the estimate of the total number of degenerate ( in the absence of electronic disorder ) tls which would be needed to produce the conductance observed in ref .",
    "is found to be unphysically large , indicating another problem with the two - channel kondo scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider in greater detail the role of symmetry - breaking disorder , present the main results , and discuss their implications for the interpretation of the ralph - buhrman experiments  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] contains the derivation of the splitting distribution for the magnetic and non - magnetic kondo effects .",

    "we use the notation @xmath20 .",
    "greek indices are used to label spin quantum numbers , and latin indices denote channel quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "when considering the orbital two - channel realization of the kondo effect due to electron - tls interaction , it is convenient for our purposes to use , as a simple model of a tls , an atom which can tunnel between two minima of a double - well potential located at @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ tls ] ) .",

    "it has been discussed in numerous works including refs .  .",
    "a related self - consistent model for the case of a _ finite _ concentration of kondo impurities has been considered in ref .  .",
    "this term affects only the charge degree of freedom , and one of its effects is to randomize the kondo temperature @xmath0 . in systems of lower dimensionality",
    ", it can also produce singular corrections to the energy dependence of thermodynamic and transport coefficients in the perturbative high - temperature regime . incorporating charge disorder into the description of the low - temperature ( @xmath46 ) regime of the kondo effect",
    "has not been achieved so far .",
    "however , it has been argued in ref .   that , in the one - channel magnetic case , the basic nature of the ground state as a local fermi liquid would not change .    in the context of the magnetic kondo effect , we will only consider the role of spin disorder .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict the consideration to the case of the ordinary one - channel effect , both because multichannel magnetic realizations have not been unambiguously observed , and because the consideration of the renormalization of splittings ( section  [ sec3 ] ) can not be transferred to the case @xmath47 .",
    "[ the renormalization of splittings in the @xmath48 case is discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the results for a hypothetical magnetic isotropic @xmath48 case can be obtained by a simple change @xmath49 in eq.([eq17 ] ) . ]    in the orbital two - channel realization of the kondo effect , the roles of spin and orbital degrees of freedom are partially interchanged .",

    "what follows , the term `` spin scattering '' is understood to apply either to physical spin in the context of magnetic kondo effect , or to `` pseudospin '' constructed out of electronic states of different parity in the context of the orbital two - channel realization .",
    "our choice of model for disorder assumes that breaking of the spin symmetry is due to a well - defined set of scatterers present in the system .",
    "the scatterers couple to the spin degrees of freedom , _",
    "e.g. _ `` frozen '' magnetic impurities in the magnetic one - channel case , or ordinary non - magnetic defects in the orbital two - channel case .",
    "replacing such a set of defects by a continuous random gaussian - distributed potential , as is frequently done in transport calculations , is not warranted here because the distribution of splittings  @xmath1 is non - universal .",
    "that is , its form depends on the choice of the distribution function for the random potentials @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and therefore a more realistic model is required .    in the model of isolated scatterers spin disorder is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 are randomly oriented frozen spins located at randomly selected points @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the corresponding exchange coupling constant .",
    "the distribution of each of @xmath54 is assumed isotropic and is given by @xmath57    in the tls case , we use a slightly more general expression , allowing for scatterers of finite size : @xmath58 since `` spin '' degrees of freedom in this case are a subset of orbital degrees of freedom , the above expression contains both charge disorder and `` spin '' disorder terms .",
    "we will only concentrate on the effect of the latter .    below we will restrict our consideration to the case of rotationally invariant potentials @xmath59 , so that the corresponding scattering matrix @xmath60 can be reduced to the diagonal form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 can be expressed in terms of phase shifts @xmath63 for each value of the orbital angular momentum as @xmath64    the coordinates @xmath55 of @xmath65 impurities are drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total volume of the sample .",
    "the calculations are performed in the limit @xmath68 with the concentration @xmath69 kept finite .",
    "it is assumed that the concentration is small in the sense that the typical inter - impurity distance @xmath70 is much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath71 , which implies , in the magnetic case , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in the tls case , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the fermi energy and fermi momentum , respectively .",
    "the effective `` spin '' scattering time in the tls case is also of the order of @xmath76 , and we will keep the notation @xmath77 for it .",
    "what is the main effect of spin scattering on the behavior of a kondo impurity ?",
    "even though a non - zero value of @xmath43 means that  spin memory \" of electrons has a finite lifetime , the spin - flip processes at the location of the kondo impurity still lead to logarithmic divergences in the high - temperature perturbative expansion ( see appendix  [ suscept ] ) .",
    "in fact ,  @xmath43 does not directly compete with the kondo temperature  @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , spin scattering can change the low - temperature behavior of an impurity by introducing an effective splitting ,  @xmath1 , between its internal states .    to understand qualitatively why finite",
    "@xmath43 does not by itself destroy the kondo effect , consider the underlying anderson model for a magnetic impurity . in this description ,",
    "the kondo effect is reflected in the logarithmic divergence of the perturbative contributions to the impurity electron self - energy at  @xmath74 .",
    "there are two processes that contribute to this self - energy : tunneling of an impurity electron into the conduction band , and the reverse process , tunneling of a conduction electron onto the impurity .",
    "both of these contributions are logarithmically divergent at @xmath74 but with opposite signs . for an impurity without on - site interactions , the two terms cancel and there is no kondo effect .",
    "interactions remove this cancelation , essentially because an occupied site can only decay in one way  by an electron tunneling out ( double occupancy is forbidden or strongly suppressed by coulomb repulsion ) , while an unoccupied site can decay in two ways  by an electron of either spin tunneling in .",
    "the appearance of a finite @xmath43 may change slightly the relative tunneling rates for spin - up and spin - down electrons , but it can not significantly change the factor of two difference between the rate of decay of an occupied and an unoccupied site . hence @xmath43 does not directly destroy the logarithmic divergences in perturbation theory associated with the kondo effect .",
    "importantly , however , the main effect of spin scattering is to break time - reversal invariance and hence induce a splitting  @xmath1 between the two spin states of the kondo impurity .",
    "the splitting results from the appearance of a random non - zero quantum - mechanical expectation value of the local spin density of states @xmath78 at the impurity site .",
    "the coupling of @xmath78 to the dynamic impurity via  @xmath79 is responsible for breaking the energy degeneracy between different orientations of the impurity spin . in the diagrammatic language , the splitting is associated _ not _ with the modification of the standard set of logarithmic diagrams , but rather with proliferation of a new set of diagrams which were forbidden by @xmath80 and time - reversal symmetries in the absence of spin disorder . the leading contribution to  @xmath1 in perturbation theory in the coupling strength @xmath79",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the energy scale established by  @xmath1 serves as a cut - off of all logarithmic divergences in the perturbation theory in  @xmath79 .",
    "formally , the main effect of spin disorder is to generate a self - energy term which is essentially energy - independent , and can be reinterpreted as a contribution to the effective impurity hamiltonian .",
    "it is a hermitian @xmath81 matrix in the space of impurity states . in the magnetic case , it is convenient to expand this matrix in the basis of pauli matrices as @xmath82 where the  @xmath83 denote the components of the impurity energy in this basis .",
    "the discussion presented so far does not distinguish between the one- and two - channel cases .",
    "this is natural since the high - temperature diagrammatic expansions in the two cases have identical structures , and differ only in factors of @xmath84 ( from the two channels ) for closed electronic loops .",
    "if the kondo temperature @xmath85 , spin - flip processes are suppressed at @xmath86 , the strongly correlated state is never formed , and below  @xmath1 all temperature dependences are of the fermi liquid type .",
    "if , however , @xmath87 , the behavior of the one- and two - channel kondo systems is very different . in the one - channel case",
    "a non - zero but small @xmath1 is equivalent to a weak polarizing field acting on the kondo impurity , resulting in finite but small changes in the values of impurity susceptibility and conductance .",
    "however , since these quantities depend on @xmath0 , which is itself altered in a random way by disorder , no significant experimental consequences follow from a small splitting @xmath88 .",
    "conversely , in the two - channel case when  @xmath89 there appear two distinct low - temperature regimes .",
    "a non - fermi - liquid regime survives in the interval between @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a new characteristic temperature , @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "a fermi - liquid regime emerges below @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the low - temperature properties of an ensemble of two - channel kondo impurities will explicitly depend on the distribution of splittings  @xmath1 .    if @xmath93 , a non - fermi - liquid regime does not exist , and at temperatures below  @xmath1 the splitting becomes the only relevant energy scale .",
    "in other words , the tls ( or , rather , the composite object comprised of the tls and correlated electrons ) becomes frozen in its lowest energy state .",
    "excitations above this state result in @xmath94 dependences which blend with other fermi - liquid effects that are always present . as was demonstrated by moustakas and fisher  @xcite , a generic set of tls parameters almost always corresponds to @xmath95 . in order to observe the non - fermi - liquid square - root scaling behavior , the parameters of the hamiltonian have to be fine",

    "the results of our model calculation of the splitting between the states of magnetic impurities and non - magnetic two - level systems ( tls ) in the presence of spin disorder can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the main feature of the distribution functions of the splittings is their strong asymmetry .",
    "formally the distribution functions in eqs.([eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) do not even possess finite first moments .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that all the moments of the splittings are dominated by disorder configurations with one or more scatterers located very close to the dynamic impurity . in real systems",
    "the shortest possible separation between the dynamic impurity and the nearest scatterer is determined by the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore one has to introduce a short distance , lattice cut - off into the coordinate integration in eq.([eq10 ] ) . in the presence of such a cutoff",
    "all the moments are dominated by distances of the order of the cut - off , and thus , for example , the average rms splitting @xmath324 is of the order of @xmath325 for the magnetic case or @xmath326 for the non - magnetic tls case .",
    "these values are larger than the typical ones by a factor of @xmath327 .",
    "this confirms the result obtained independently by d.  cox  @xcite .",
    "second , since the splitting is the difference between two eigenvalues of a random hermitian @xmath81 matrix , at small splittings one observes the equivalent of level repulsion leading to a vanishing probability density to observe zero splitting . in the non - magnetic tls case",
    "the matrix is real and symmetric , and the suppression is linear rather than quadratic .",
    "the asymmetry of the distribution functions has important implications for the study of the effects of spin disorder on the behavior of kondo impurities in the crossover and low - temperature regimes . because of the build - up of many - particle correlations at low temperatures , the effective splitting between the levels of magnetic impurities or tls , @xmath328 ,",
    "can be reduced at intermediate temperatures @xmath310 compared to the bare value  @xmath1 ( refs .  ) .",
    "since the distribution of splittings is very asymmetric , with the root - mean - square splitting much larger than the typical value , a proper renormalization analysis would necessarily treat the full distribution rather than just the first few moments .",
    "to what extent the distributions found here preserve their shape under renormalization is an open question .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - temperature behavior of the splitting , or , more precisely , of the corresponding self - energy terms , is dictated by the universality properties of the one- and two - channel kondo models , and can be extracted directly .",
    "this , in turn , made it possible to derive a corresponding temperature dependence of conductance for a collection of two - level systems .",
    "we find ( cf . ref .  ) a @xmath329 behavior with @xmath330 in contrast to the @xmath153 dependence observed experimentally  .",
    "the concentration of the tls which must be degenerate ( in the absence of disorder ) in order to sustain the two - channel kondo interpretation is also found to be unphysically large .",
    "both these arguments suggest that the two - channel kondo model does not provide a consistent interpretation of the zero - bias anomalies observed in ref .  .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have computed the distribution functions of splittings of magnetic impurities and non - magnetic two - level systems ( tls ) induced by disorder scattering of conduction electrons . in the magnetic case",
    "these splittings only appear if the disorder breaks time - reversal symmetry , _ i.e. _ if the disorder is itself magnetic . in the non - magnetic case",
    "the degeneracy between the levels of a tls is due to geometric symmetry about its center , and therefore is strongly broken by any type of disorder .",
    "we find that the probability distribution of splittings vanishes as a power law at small splittings , making nearly degenerate impurities a rarity .",
    "the typical values of splittings are found to be smaller than the average estimated previously in ref .  .",
    "however , even in quite clean systems such as the ones studied in the experiments of ref .  , the broad profile of the distribution of splittings results in a temperature dependence of the conductance which is substantially different from the square - root law expected in the absence of disorder",

    "the choice of the bare coupling values @xmath350 and @xmath351 , which is adopted in the calculations leading to the graphs in figs .  [ pofdelta ] and [ condplot ] , corresponds to the kondo temperature of @xmath352 .",

    "the transport mean free path near the opening of the constriction is estimated in ref .   to be @xmath356 in _ unannealed _ samples .",
    "the mean free path is related to the scattering phase shifts @xmath63 and concentration of defects @xmath199 via  @xcite @xmath357 where @xmath358 denotes angular momentum channels .",
    "the transport mean free path in _ annealed _ samples is shown in ref .   to be close to @xmath359 , _",
    "i.e. _ it increases by a factor of 10 upon annealing .",
    "therefore , most of the disorder in the constriction is likely to be caused not by substitution impurities which can not anneal , but by localized structural inhomogeneities in stressed deposited films .",
    "spatially extended defects , such as dislocations and grain boundaries , are unlikely to be a major cause of scattering for the same reason .",
    "the coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) can not be expressed in terms of the transport mean free path alone .",
    "their computation requires the knowledge of the phase shifts @xmath63 [ which would make it possible to infer the concentration from eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) ] . even allowing for an independent measurement of defect concentration ( one not available for the ralph - buhrman samples ) , information about phase shifts is still needed if more than one of them is non - zero .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) that the scale for the typical values of  @xmath1 is set by the combinations @xmath360 , @xmath361 , and , for small @xmath63 , it is linear in both @xmath199 and @xmath63 .",
    "together with eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) , this implies that , for a fixed value of @xmath362 , smaller values of @xmath63 result in a broader distribution function @xmath363 . for example , the choice of @xmath364 leads to typical values of @xmath91 exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , if scatterers are strong ( @xmath365 ) , fewer of them are needed to produce the same value of @xmath362 , and the distribution function is narrowed , implying smaller typical disorder - induced splittings .",
    "it should be noted that because of the friedel sum rule , small values of _ all _ @xmath366 are possible only in the case of neutral defects .",
    "if defects are charged , at least one of the phase shifts can not be small .",
    "a typical neutral defect is a combination of a self - interstitial and a neighboring vacancy ( a so - called frenkel defect ) .",
    "we are not aware of any studies of whether such defects are more or less common in vacuum - deposited films than simple non - equilibrium vacancies , which are charged , and thus scatter strongly . however , the formation energy of such neutral defects in cu is @xmath84 to @xmath367 times larger than the formation energy of a vacancy  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we concentrate on the non - equilibrium vacancies as the dominant source of scattering .",
    "since one of the aims of this work is to explore whether the two - channel kondo interpretation of the ralph - buhrman zero - bias anomalies can be compatible with the presence of the static scattering in their samples , the assumption that the bulk of disorder is caused by strongly scattering non - equilibrium vacancies is also quite appropriate .",
    "it leads to the smallest values of splittings , and is , therefore , the most favorable for the two - channel kondo interpretation of the experiments in ref .  .",
    "scattering by vacancies in cu has been studied by several techniques ( experimental , numerical , and their combination ) in ref .  .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure combining experimental and numerical techniques quoted in ref .   give for the differences between the vacancy and the host phase shifts the following set of values : @xmath368 , @xmath369 , and @xmath370 .",
    "fluctuations of the kondo temperature @xmath0 due to static disorder can be addressed in the same framework used for the calculation of the distribution of splittings .",
    "indeed , in the leading logarithmic order , the kondo temperature can be inferred from the scaling relation  @xcite @xmath371 where @xmath372 is the renormalized band cut - off , @xmath30 is a homogeneous degree one function of dimensionless couplings @xmath373 , and @xmath374 is a homogeneous function of degree two which depends on @xmath30 and bare values of the couplings .",
    "the effect of disorder is contained in the energy - dependent density of states @xmath375 .",
    "the homogeneity of both @xmath30 and @xmath374 allows one to make a substitution @xmath376 , where @xmath377 is the average density of states , while transferring the energy dependence of @xmath99 to the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the implicit equation for @xmath0 takes the form @xmath378dd}{2\\overline{\\nu}d},\\ ] ] where @xmath379 is the unrenormalized bandwidth , and the boundary condition @xmath380=0 $ ] was used . following the consideration in section  [ sec3b ] ,",
    "the correction to the density of states as a function of energy @xmath242 is expressed as @xmath381 where @xmath382 are the coordinates of random scatterers . substituting the above expression into eq .",
    "( [ tk ] ) we obtain the following condition for the disorder - induced shift @xmath383 : @xmath384 the argument of the integral cosine @xmath385 is small as @xmath386 , where the values @xmath387 and @xmath126 are used ( see section  [ experiment ] ) .",
    "it can therefore be approximated as @xmath388 , where @xmath389 is the euler constant .",
    "typical values of @xmath390 are thus seen to be of the order of @xmath391 $ ] , and we estimate @xmath392 .",
    "therefore random variations of @xmath0 _ due to static disorder _ can be safely neglected for the parameter regime of ref .  .",
    "intrinsic variation of @xmath0 among different randomly formed tls is , of course , a possibility .",
    "however , it has been established in the main text that all tls have to be degenerate in order for the two - channel kondo interpretation to have a chance of succeeding .",
    "thus one must assume that the tls are formed by the same non - random mechanism , again excluding large variations of @xmath0 .",
    "effects of elastic strains , and intrinsic asymmetry of tls are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "a broad distribution of intrinsic splittings would render the two - channel kondo effect unobservable , and for the purposes of analyzing the ralph - buhrman experiments we assume that electronic disorder is the only source of asymmetry . while it is not implausible that , in the absence of disorder , the tls are naturally degenerate  , generation of splittings by elastic strains , which are almost certain to be present in vacuum deposited films before annealing , deserves a separate study . in neglecting their contribution altogether",
    "we can obtain only the lower bounds on the characteristic values of splittings .    in the case of tls ,",
    "channel quantum numbers in eq .",
    "( [ nck ] ) would refer to physical spin , while spin quantum numbers correspond to parity about the center of the tls , or , more precisely to linear combinations of angular momentum eigenstates which are either even or odd under parity  @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional subspace of all such states has been shown in ref .   to be the only subspace relevant in the renormalization group sense .",
    "the analysis of moustakas and fisher has been critically reevaluated by zawadowski _",
    "et al . _ [ a.  zawadowski , g.  zarand , p.  nozires , k.  vladr , and g.  t.  zimnyi , phys . rev .",
    "b * 56 * , 12947 ( 1997 ) ] , who showed that the magnitude of splitting  @xmath1 was overestimated in ref .  .",
    "however , the basic conclusion reached in ref .   that the non - fermi - liquid behavior is possible only in a limited range of tls parameters remains valid .      strictly speaking ,",
    "the universality of the crossover scale @xmath91 has been proven in anisotropic models only for the case @xmath393 , and @xmath394 .",
    "the regime considered in the present work is very close to this limit ( @xmath395 , @xmath396 ) , so that the corresponding corrections ( if any do exist ) to @xmath91 must be small .",
    "similarly , we neglect the distinction between the local symmetry - breaking field which acts on impurity alone , and global field ( such as the physical magnetic field in the magnetic kondo problem ) which acts on the spin of conduction electrons as well .",
    "quantities which are universal in the latter case can acquire non - universal corrections when the field acts on impurity alone .",
    "such corrections , however , are proportional to the bare values of the couplings ( more precisely , the corresponding phase shifts  @xcite ) .",
    "these are always small in realistic models , and , for the purposes of the present study , can be ignored .",
    "it is easy to show that the distribution of the spin - disorder contribution to @xmath397 possesses a strong asymmetry similar to that in the distribution of the splittings , so that the average @xmath398 is dominated by the tails of its distribution .",
    "however , since a physical measurement of susceptibility directly corresponds to measuring the average @xmath398 we do not analyze its distribution in detail ."
