    "all states in @xmath1b are particle unbound which hinders the search for excited states .",
    "there exists a long  standing controversy concerning the properties of the @xmath1b first excited state , as obtained both experimentally and theoretically , see @xcite .",

    "@xcite a semi  microscopic model to describe the low  energy photodisintegration of @xmath1be has been developed .",
    "an estimation of the reliability of various data sets has been obtained with the help of this model , and a theoretical photodisintegration cross section has been derived for astrophysical applications .",
    "the model provides @xmath4be effective potentials that reproduce the energy dependence of the cross section . using them the properties of the first excited state of @xmath1be",
    "are extracted below and estimates for its @xmath1b partner are obtained .    in the next section",
    "we elucidate the nature of the first excited state of @xmath1be and obtain its position .",
    "we obtain an analytic form for the line shape of the state and investigate to what degree the line shape is independent of the specific excitation process . in sec .",

    ". 2 and 3 are of a rather general applicability . in the appendix a formula expressing a residue at a virtual state pole in terms of a quadrature taken over the virtual state eigenfunction is given .",

    ", the @xmath1be photodisintegration cross section has been calculated in the framework of the following model .",
    " body @xmath6 representation of the system has been adopted .",
    "the @xmath1be ground state wave function has been calculated from the three  body dynamic equation with @xmath7 and @xmath8 potentials .",

    "the latter wave function has been calculated from the woods ",

    "the model thus gives @xmath10be effective potentials that allow extracting the properties of the first excited state of @xmath1be .",

    "the model accounts for only the two ",
    "body @xmath10be photodisintegration and disregards the direct three ",
    "body @xmath11 disintegration .",
    "the cross section for the direct @xmath11 disintegration is presumably very small due to the threshold regime which is confirmed in experiment , see @xcite .",
    "further , the properties of the state considered are determined by the phase shift @xmath12 of @xmath10be scattering .",
    "so , the question arises whether this phase shift can be correctly obtained with the help of the model . in this connection",
    "one can admit that in the vicinity of the first excited state of @xmath1be the energy dependence of the photodisintegration cross section is also determined by this phase shift . to a degree this holds true , use of the two ",
    "body @xmath9be@xmath13 dynamics to extract the properties of the state does not contain any restrictions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the cross section has been fitted for excitation energies up to 0.5 mev , and in this region the corresponding energy dependence @xmath14 dominates the cross section , see fig . 1 below .",
    "moreover , the initial @xmath1be ground state is described realistically in this model .",
    "therefore , use of the two  body dynamics seems to be sufficient for extracting the properties of the state considered . in general , these properties can also be extracted via the fit of an assumed line shape directly to the data .",
    "however , use of the two  body dynamics in conjunction with shell  model considerations allowed selection between alternative data sets in ref .",
    "@xcite . below",
    "it will also help us to obtain the properties of the analog @xmath1b state relying on the @xmath1be photodisintegration data .",

    "the energy of the state is @xmath23 this value was obtained via solving the eigenvalue problem with the virtual state boundary condition , cf . the appendix .",
    "let us consider the shape of the line for a transition proceeding via the virtual state .",
    "the shape depends partly on the specific way of excitation of the state .",
    "the main energy dependence is universal , however , and it is determined by the intrinsic properties of the state .",
    "we shall compare the universal energy dependence to the energy dependence for the process of @xmath1be photodisintegration and thus estimate the dependence of the line shape on the specific process .",
    "we assume that the cross section for formation of @xmath1be in the continuum with the energy @xmath24 in the vicinity of the excited level can approximately be presented in the form @xmath25 here @xmath26 is some localized state in the subspace of the @xmath1be degrees of freedom .",
