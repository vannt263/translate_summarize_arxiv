    "the discreteness of the spectrum of the permitted velocity @xmath0 states because of the bohr s quantization @xmath1 goes down with the radius @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 increase , in agreement with the bohr s correspondence principle .",
    "therefore the quantum phenomena , such as the persistent current of electrons , can be observed in nano - rings with @xmath4 only at low temperature @xcite even at microscopic mass @xmath5 .",
    "superconductivity is the exception thanks to the impossibility for cooper pairs to change their quantum state @xmath6 individually @xcite .",
    "this exception gives us an opportunity for more detailed research of phenomena connected with the bohr s quantization : a ring , in contrast to atom , can be made in different forms .",
    "we can observe the change of the quantum number @xmath6 in magnetic field @xmath7 thanks to a `` huge '' radius @xmath8 of superconducting ring in comparison with atom orbit radius @xmath9 .",
    "this change is observed because of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , i.e. the influence of the magnetic vector potential @xmath10 of the canonical momentum @xmath11 of a particle with charge @xmath12 .",
    "the momentum of a free particle is described with the gradient @xmath13 of the phase @xmath14 of the wave function @xmath15 , according to the quantum formalism .",
    "because of the requirement that the complex wave function , describing a particle state , must be single - valued @xmath16 at any point , the phase @xmath14 must change by integral @xmath6 multiples of @xmath17 following a complete turn along the path of integration , yielding @xmath18 .",
    "the integer number @xmath6 of the permitted state with minimum energy @xmath19 should change with magnetic flux @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "the flux quantum @xmath22 equals @xmath23 for electron @xmath24 and @xmath25 for cooper pair @xmath26 .",
    "consequently the @xmath6 change can be observed in magnetic field @xmath27 in a superconducting ring with @xmath28 and in the inaccessibly high magnetic fields @xmath29 for atom orbit with @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic periodicity in different parameters , such as : resistance @xcite , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , critical current @xcite and dc voltage @xcite demonstrate unambiguously the @xmath6 change with the magnetic flux @xmath30 inside ring : the resistance oscillations have minimum value at @xmath31 and maximum value at @xmath21 , in accordance with the theoretical relation @xmath32 ; magnetic susceptibility and dc voltage change the sign at @xmath31 and @xmath21 , in accordance with the theoretical relation @xmath33 ; the critical current of symmetric ring have minimum value at @xmath21 and maximum value at @xmath21 , in accordance with the relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the persistent current circulating in the ring clockwise or anticlockwise @xcite .",
    "no jump , which could be connected with the jump of the permitted velocity @xmath36 and the persistent current , because of the @xmath6 change at @xmath21 is observed at these measurements in accordance with the theory : the squared velocity @xmath37 and the absolute value of the persistent current @xmath38 should not change with @xmath6 change from @xmath6 to @xmath39 at @xmath21 ; the average velocity at @xmath40 at @xmath21 .",
    "the aluminum ring @xmath41 with asymmetric link - up of current leads , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . ]     the magnetic dependencies of the critical current @xmath44 of aluminum ring with asymmetric link - up of current leads measured at the temperature @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ; @xmath47 . ]",
    "the jump could be expected at measurement of the oscillations of the critical current of a superconducting ring with different section of ring halves @xmath48 .",
    "the critical current measured in the one @xmath49 or other @xmath50 direction should be equal @xcite @xmath51 when the external current @xmath52 measuring @xmath49 , @xmath50 is added with the persistent current @xmath53 in the narrow ring half @xmath54and @xmath55 when the currents are added in the wide ring half @xmath56 .",
    "the jump @xmath57 should be observed because of the change of the persistent current direction with the @xmath6 change at @xmath21 .",
    "but the measurements @xcite have revealed the absence of the expected jump in spite of the enough large amplitude @xmath58 of the persistent current and the relation @xmath59 . according to the universally recognised quantum formalism",
    "the anisotropy @xmath60 of the critical current measured in the opposite directions should appear in the asymmetric ring @xmath61 because of the change of the functions @xmath44 , @xmath62 describing its magnetic dependencies , see fig.19 @xcite and fig.3 @xcite .",
    "but it was found @xcite that the anisotropy @xmath63 appears because of the changes in the arguments @xmath64 , @xmath65 of the functions rather than the functions themselves .",
    "the shift of the periodic dependencies of the critical current on the quarter of the flux quantum @xmath66 @xcite is very paradoxical phenomenon which can not be explained now as well as the absence of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 jump with the @xmath6 change .",
    "in order to clear up the essence of the second puzzle we have measured the magnetic dependencies of the critical current of aluminum ring with asymmetric link - up of current leads , fig.1 . the critical current should determined with the transition into the resistive state only of the shot segment @xmath67 at the relation of the persistent current amplitude and the critical current @xmath68 measured on the ring , fig.2 , with the segment relation @xmath69 .",
    "the critical current dependencies should describe with the relations @xmath70 @xmath71 implying the jump @xmath72 at @xmath21 , fig.2 .",
    "the measured dependencies @xmath44 , @xmath62 correspond to the expected one ( 2 ) in the region near @xmath31 , fig.2 .",
    "nevertheless the jump , which must be because of the quantum number @xmath6 change according to ( 2 ) , is not observed , fig.2 . the measured values of the critical current @xmath44 , @xmath62 vary smoothly with magnetic flux value near @xmath21 , fig.2 , in defiance of the quantum formalism predicting the @xmath73 jump ( 2 ) . the aspiration of nature to avoid the jump surprises .",
    "it is puzzle that the experimental and theoretical dependencies agree near @xmath74 and disagree near @xmath75 ."
