    "the dynamics of correlated quantum systems attracts a growing attention sparked by the recent development of quantum devices with long coherence times and dynamical control of parameters , e.g.  superconducting circuits and ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "an additional asset of the latter is that disorder may be introduced in a controlled way  @xcite .",
    "disorder may strongly affect dynamical processes , mainly due to anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "understanding the interplay of disorder and interactions in dynamical quantum systems is thus of fundamental importance and localization in quantum systems is still the subject of active research  @xcite .",
    "this topic has also been addressed in the context of quasi - periodic systems  @xcite .    in correlated quantum systems ,",
    "most basic dynamical processes are determined by the transport properties of their collective excitations  @xcite .",
    "an important starting point in the understanding of localization in correlated systems thus relies on classification according to the symmetries of their excitations  @xcite . for fermi systems , it is mostly based on the three classes of random matrices  @xcite as well as chiral or particle - hole symmetries  @xcite . for bose systems ,",
    "a strong distinction arises between goldstone and non - golstone modes  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a bose superfluid , while localization is at its strongest at low energy for particle - like excitations , it is suppressed for phonon excitations  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is based on a weak disorder analysis and holds in dimension @xmath0 where localization occurs for arbitrary weak disorder .",
    "it is , however , challenged in higher dimension where the onset of the anderson transition requires sufficiently strong disorder , which may alter the very nature of the excitations .    in this work we study the transport of collective excitations in a disordered , weakly - interacting bose superfluid in dimension higher than one .",
    "we show that the competition of disorder , screening , and density depletion yields a strongly non - monotonic and non - universal energy dependence of the disorder parameter , which controls the localization properties . in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    ", our analysis indicates that the localization diagram exhibits several classes of mobility spectra , characterized by either no or several mobility edges .",
    "we finally discuss implications of these localization properties on quantum - quench experiments with disordered ultracold atoms .",
    "to study the transport of collective excitations in the presence of disorder , it is worth devising a scattering problem . for weakly - interacting bose superfluids ,",
    "we may rely on meanfield theory  @xcite .",
    "the background density field @xmath1 obeys the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , @xmath2\\sqrt{{n_{\\textrm{c}}}({\\mathbf{r } } ) } = 0 ,   \\label{eq : gpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the particle mass , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , and @xmath5 is the coupling constant of short - range repulsive interactions . the disordered potential @xmath6 is chosen to be spatially homogeneous , isotropic , and of vanishing statistical average . for weak disorder , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe ] ) can be solved perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "below , we consider regimes of strong disorder and it is necessary to extend this approach , including possible local depletion of the density around the disorder maxima . to do so , we generically write the density field in the form @xmath7/g ,   \\label{eq : nc}\\ ] ] where the field @xmath8 describes the modulations of the density due to the disorder , and the quantity @xmath9 is a shift in the chemical potential .",
    "the latter allows us to impose the conventional condition that @xmath8 is of zero statistical average .",
    "notice that since the density is positive everywhere , @xmath10 , the field @xmath8 is bounded above , @xmath11 .",
    "we then insert eq .",

    "the zero - average condition , @xmath16 , then yields @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes statistical averaging .",

    "@xmath23 follow those of the disorder , smoothed at the length scale of the healing length  @xcite . however",
    ", both the amplitude of the smoothed potential and the healing length are renormalized by the energy shift @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for strong disorder , the field @xmath8 locally saturates to the constant value @xmath24 at positions where @xmath14 typically exceeds the chemical potential @xmath4 ( more precisely , where @xmath25 ) . in those regions , which will be referred to as _ depleted regions _ , we thus have @xmath26 ( see fig .  [",

    "+ knowing the density field @xmath21 , we now treat the collective excitations .",
    "the phase and density fluctuations , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are readily found by developing the many - body hamiltonian up to order two in the operator @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting quadratic hamiltonian is then diagonalized by the bogoliubov transform @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the annihilation operator of an elementary pair excitation of energy @xmath35 .",

    "( [ eq : bdge ] ) devises a well - defined two - wave scattering problem .",
    "the dynamics of a given excitation at energy @xmath35 is governed by the homogeneous propagator @xmath39 and scattering from a disordered medium defined by @xmath40 .",
    "the latter combines the two random fields @xmath41 and @xmath8 , which are strongly correlated [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) to ( [ eq : ncsc2 ] ) ] .    at this point",
    ", one could wonder whether the bogoliubov approach is valid even in the presence of strong density depletion .",
    "the main approximation here is the truncation of the many - body hamiltonian at second order in the bogoliubov operator . since the latter is equivalent to the linearization of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( tgpe )  @xcite , it can be tested by comparing the meanfield dynamics predicted by the exact tgpe on the one hand and by the linearized tgpe on the other hand .",
    "our results show excellent agreement between the two in all regimes , namely the phonon , particle , intermediate regimes for weak to strong density depletion ( for details , see appendix .",

    "it validates the use of the bogoliubov approach used here .",
    "universal transport properties can now be inferred using the one - parameter scaling ( ops ) approach  @xcite , which can be extended to the case of excitations , as we outline here .",
    "it consists in developing a renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis of the size - dependent conductance .",

    "@xcite , which is the ratio of the energy scale associated to diffusion across a finite sample of size @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 the classical diffusion constant , @xmath45 the excitation velocity , and @xmath46 the boltzmann transport mean free path ) , to the energy - level spacing , @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 the density of states per unit volume ) . in diffusive regimes , if @xmath49 is the momentum associated to the energy @xmath35 , then @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . in localized regimes ,",
    "the conductance is exponentially small , @xmath53 with @xmath54 the localization length , and @xmath55 . for @xmath0 , @xmath56 is strictly negative and @xmath57 always flows down to the localized regime .",
    "then , all states are localized , with the localization length @xmath58 in 1d and @xmath59 in 2d .",
    "conversely , for @xmath60 , the rg flow has an unstable fixed point at @xmath61 , known as the mobility edge or the anderson localization transition  @xcite . since the above scaling laws are independent of the dispersion relation , these features are all universal , except the transition point , which is determined by the value of the inverse disorder parameter ( idp ) @xmath62 .      in order to estimate the idp for the scattering problem  ( [ eq : bdge ] ) , we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and extend it to strong disorder with possible local density depletion ( see details in appendix  [ sec : a2 ] ) . in brief",
    ", we note that the homogeneous propagator @xmath39 does not support only plane - wave modes with momentum @xmath63 such that @xmath64 , but also evanescent modes of penetration length @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",
    "the latter ensures that for a scattering length larger than the penetration length , the excitation modes @xmath67 can be decomposed into two fields @xmath68 , where the second one is enslaved by the first one .",
    "retaining only the leading disorder terms , the behavior of the excitation is then entirely determined by the field @xmath69 , which fulfills the closed equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "the so - called screened potential @xmath73 results from the competition of the bare disorder @xmath41 and the meanfield repulsive interaction , determined by the field @xmath8 .",

    "notice that in 1d , the angular integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kelbana ] ) reduces to @xmath79 so that one recovers the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for the lyapunov exponent .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the previous approach describes only excitations of energy @xmath80 .",
    "otherwise , we have @xmath81 and all modes of @xmath39 are evanescent . in the following , we will thus disregard the case of excitations @xmath82 , which in most cases reduces to a very narrow energy range at the bottom of the spectrum , since @xmath83 .",
    "it should as well be pointed out that since it retains only leading terms in disorder , our theory is not expected to be quantitatively exact , but rather to provide a qualitative description of the relevant physics .",
    "possible extensions of the approach are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "we can now discuss the behavior of the disorder parameter of the excitations .",
    "for concreteness , let us consider a generic impurity model described by the potential @xmath84 the impurities are independent gaussian - shaped potentials of width @xmath85 , @xmath86 , randomly distributed in space with density @xmath87 , and with amplitudes @xmath88 that take the values @xmath89 or @xmath90 with equal probability ( see fig .",

    "this two - impurity model generalizes the one - impurity model , which is widely used in studies of anderson localization in non - interacting systems  @xcite . here , we introduce two types of impurities , namely repulsive ( @xmath94 ) and attractive ( @xmath95 ) ones .",
    "in contrast to non - interacting systems , it is crucial to distinguish repulsive and attractive impurities in the present work because they have radically different effects on the density background .",
    "for instance , only repulsive impurities can induce local density depletion .",
    "the two - impurity model is generic in the sense that it is the simplest one to describe a disordered system where different kinds of impurities are present .",
    "in addition , controlled impurity models can be realized in ultracold - atom systems where the impurities are made of individual atoms trapped at some random sites of an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "so far , only one - impurity models have been realized  @xcite but they can be extended to models with different kinds of impurities using different atomic species .      to compute the idp for the previous impurity model , we first numerically determine the density background @xmath22 and @xmath9 following the previous self - consistent procedure .",
    "this permits to compute the screened potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscreen ] ) and its power spectrum , from which the idp is inferred using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kelbana ] ) . figure  [ fig : kelb3d ] shows the energy dependence of the idp for the 3d balanced impurity case ( @xmath96 ) , plotted as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "qualitatively similar curves are found for lower dimensions and for imbalanced impurity cases ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "depending on the disorder strength , the idp exhibits three generic behaviors .",
    "notice that @xmath99 corresponds to @xmath100 .    for weak disorder ( case  a in fig .",
    "[ fig : kelb3d ] ) , the idp shows a non - monotonic energy dependence , which can be understood as follows . at high energy ,",
    "the excitations are insensitive to the density background and behave as particles in the bare disorder potential .",
    "conversely , at low energy , the excitations are strongly affected by the density background , which screens the disorder and suppresses scattering .",
    "more precisely , this holds when the chemical potential exceeds the maximum of the smoothed potential , i.e.  for @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the smoothed impurity .",
    "then , the density background as no depleted region . the power spectrum of the screened potential , @xmath103 , can be computed explicitly as a function of that of the bare disorder , @xmath104 , and of the excitation energy @xmath35 using eq .",

    "( [ eq : kelbana ] ) and ( [ eq : equation1 ] ) was inferred from calculations of the scattering mean free path using a different approach in ref .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : equation1 ] ) generalizes the 1d case  @xcite .",
    "it defines a screening function [ prefactor in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equation1 ] ) ] , which can also be identified in single - scattering processes  @xcite and renormalizes the disorder by the interactions .",
    "the behavior of the idp can now be found by inspection of eqs .",

    "the screening is irrelevant and we can replace @xmath103 by @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kelbana ] ) .",
    "we then recover the free - particle behavior  @xcite , @xmath107 conversely , for @xmath108 , the screening strongly enhances @xmath109 compared to the free - particle case and we find @xmath110 this result is in agreement with the universal behavior expected for goldstone modes  @xcite .",
    "both low - energy and high - energy scalings reproduce the behavior of case a and locate the minimum of the idp at @xmath111 .",
    "note that a non - monotonic behavior of the idp is also found in the propagation of other kinds of waves , such as photonic  @xcite and acoustic  @xcite ones .    for intermediate to strong disorder ( cases b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : kelb3d ] ) , the energy dependence of the idp found from the solution of the full scattering problem [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vscreen ] ) and ( [ eq : kelbana ] ) ] strongly differs from the weak disorder case at low energy , where @xmath109 now increases with the energy .",
    "to understand this , it should be noticed that , for @xmath112 , the background density is now locally depleted around the positive impurities .",
    "hence , during its propagation , an excitation goes through two types of regions , namely the _ density depleted _ region , and the rest , which constitutes the _ density bulk_. in the bulk , the field @xmath8 may be approximated by @xmath14 , provided we neglect the quantity @xmath9 , which is valid for low impurity density , @xmath113 .",
    "it yields a non - monotonic contribution to @xmath109 similar to case a , with a smaller overall magnitude due to the truncation around the positive impurities ( dashed lines in fig .",

    "conversely , in the depleted regions , the field @xmath22 saturates to the value @xmath24 . the bare disorder in those regions is thus protected against screening and eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscreen ] ) may be replaced by @xmath114 . in this field ,",
    "the excitations behave as ( non - goldstone ) free particles , yielding a monotonic contribution to @xmath109 ( dotted lines ) . in the white - noise limit ( @xmath115 ) , this contribution is @xmath116 the various behaviors of the idp observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kelb3d ] can then be interpreted as follows . neglecting the correlations between the contributions of the bulk and depleted regions ,",
    "the disorder parameter @xmath117 is approximately the sum of these two contributions .",
    "its inverse ( the idp @xmath109 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kelb3d ] ) , is thus dominated by the smallest corresponding contribution . at low energy , because of the screening in the bulk , the contribution of the depleted region always dominates if it exists , and captures the free - particle - like behavior of @xmath62 . at intermediate energy",
    "the behavior of @xmath109 crucially depends on the relative magnitude of the two contributions . when @xmath118 ( case b ) , only the upper fraction of the positive impurities is truncated and the bulk starts to dominate at moderate energy .",
    "it results in a turning point @xmath119 where bulk and depleted regions equally contribute to the idp , yielding there a local maximum .",
    "when @xmath120 increases , the depleted region dominates in a wider energy range and @xmath119 moves to higher values .",
    "when @xmath121 ( case c ) , the positive impurities are almost entirely truncated , and @xmath119 eventually merges with the local minimum @xmath122 , which does not significantly depend on @xmath120 .",
    "the curve then becomes monotonic .",
    "we now turn to the localization properties of the collective excitations , focusing on the 3d case where mobility edges appear at the localization threshold @xmath61 .",
    "we determine the latter from idp curves as those of fig .",
    "[ fig : kelb3d ] for the general model with different amplitudes of the positive ( @xmath123 ) and negative ( @xmath124 ) impurities . in all cases , they are of type a , b , or c with an overall magnitude and positions of the local maximum and minimum that depend on the parameters of the disorder potential . the resulting localization diagram , shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , displays several localization classes with between zero and three mobility edges in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the high energy states are always extended .",
    "the regions of the diagram are then determined by three conditions .",
    "firstly , the existence of depleted regions requires @xmath125 , which defines the roughly vertical line on the diagram . on the left ,",
    "the idp curves are of type a and the low - energy excitations are extended ( @xmath126 ) . just on the right , they are of type b. the low - energy excitations are then localized ( @xmath127 ) , and there is at least one mobility edge . secondly , when the local minimum of the idp curve , @xmath128 , is below the localization threshold a band of localized states appear at intermediate energy , giving rise to two additional mobility edges . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the condition reads @xmath130 , which yields the nearly horizontal line on the diagram .",
    "thirdly , when @xmath123 increases , the local maximum of the idp curve decreases . in the region with three mobility edges ( iii ) , the two low - energy ones disappear . in the region with one mobility edge ( i ) ,",
    "the idp curve turn from type b to type c , without affecting the number of mobility edges .",
    "the localization diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] is expected to be generic . in particular ,",
    "the competition of disorder , screening , and density depletion determine the diversity of mobility spectra . yet , a given model of disorder does not necessary display all cases and the imbalanced impurity model with a finite correlation length is the simplest we found that does .",
    "for instance , for only positive impurities or in the balanced case , the only possibilities are ( 0 ) or ( i ) because the minimum of the idp can not be controlled independently of the density depletion .",
    "conversely , for only negative impurities , the depleted region is absent and the only possibilities are ( 0 ) or ( ii ) .",
    "the case of white - noise disorder is also limited because the smoothed impurity potential diverges in the center , @xmath131 , so that depleted regions strictly appear as soon as @xmath132 , and the only possibilities left are ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the physics we have discussed here is particularly relevant to ultracold - atom experiments . in these systems , out - of - equilibrium dynamics can be generated by a local quench , which produces collective excitations  @xcite . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "their transport properties and ability to mediate long - range energy transfer are determined by the four classes of mobility spectra of the localization diagram . in case  ( 0 ) , all excitations are protected against localization and propagate diffusively , i.e.  @xmath133 . in all other cases , energy can only be partially transferred since some excitation modes are localized .",
    "energy - resolved quenches may provide experimental evidence of such mobility spectra in ultracold gases .",
    "moreover , these systems offer a wide range of models of disorder , e.g.  impurities  @xcite and speckle potentials  @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the latter may be tailored , which may lead to even richer localization diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the localization effects we have discussed here requires that the lifetime @xmath134 of the bogoliubov quasiparticles exceeds the transport meanfree time @xmath135 ( with @xmath136 the excitation group velocity ) . on the one hand , for low temperature",
    ", the decay of bogoliubov excitations is dominated by beliaev processes  @xcite . to estimate the corresponding decay rate @xmath137 , we resort to local density approximation . the depleted regions , where the excitations behave as free particles with infinite lifetime , very weakly contribute to @xmath138 . a good estimate of @xmath138 is thus given by the bulk contribution .",
    "for a typical excitation @xmath139 , it yields @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the scattering length  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath142 in the phonon regime and @xmath143 in the region of interest , which yields @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the validity condition of our approach reads @xmath145 , which is the validity condition of the bogoliubov approach , very verified in dilute - gas bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "for instance , using the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , we find find @xmath146s and @xmath147ms , making experimental observation of our predictions possible .",
    "the approach used in this work provides a intuitive understanding of the physics at stake as well as generic qualitative predictions for the localization behavior of collective excitations .",
    "however , since it relies on lowest - order perturbation theory , it is not expected to be quantitatively accurate . in particular , it does not take into account the disorder - induced shift of the dispersion relation , which is known , in the non - interacting case , to result in a possibly significant shift on the position of the mobility edge  @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations in the non - interacting case show that the mobility edge significantly depends on the model of disorder  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the determination of the precise localization diagram for collective pair excitations in disordered bose superfluids , as well as the identification of the various classes of mobility spectra predicted in the present work , require a full numerical resolution of the localization problem in the two - impurity model as well as in other models of disorder .",
