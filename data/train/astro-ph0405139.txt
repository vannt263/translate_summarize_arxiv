    "the standard scenario that provides the theoretical skeleton for the formation of cosmic large - scale structures in the universe is the hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "this scenario assumes that massive dark matter halos are formed via the processes of gravitational collapse , merging of smaller structures , and accretion .",
    "light - emitting and -absorbing objects form when the baryonic gas , i.e. , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , falls , cools , and condenses around and within the dark halos .",
    "the evolution of the igm in this model is largely determined by the underlying dark matter .",
    "it is usually assumed that the dynamical behavior of the igm field can be obtained from the dark matter field by a similarity mapping between the two ( e.g. , kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "the perturbations in the density and velocity distribution of the igm are considered to be the same as those of the dark matter field point by point on scales larger than the jeans length scales .    in the linear regime , this similarity mapping is correct .",
    "even when the perturbations of the initial igm distribution are different from those of the dark matter , linear growth modes will lead to similarity on scales larger than the jeans length ( bi et al .",
    "1992 ; fang et al . 1993",
    "; nusser 2000 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 )",
    ". however , in the nonlinear regime , the similarity between the igm and dark matter fields on scales larger than the jeans length may not always be present .",
    "it has been shown in hydrodynamics that a passive component generally decouples from the underlying field during nonlinear evolution ( for a review , see shraiman & siggia 2000 ) .",
    "for instance , a passive component might be highly non - gaussian , even when the underlying field is gaussian ( kraichnan 1994 ) .",
    "this nonlinear decoupling is common in stochastic systems consisting of a  passive component \" in an underlying mass field .    in the system consisting of the igm and dark matter",
    ", the igm can be considered a  passive component \" , because the evolution of the igm is driven by the gravity of the underlying dark matter . moreover",
    ", the system of the igm and dark matter is stochastic because of the randomness of the initial perturbations of the cosmic mass and velocity fields .",
    "the mass and velocity fields of the igm and dark matter are random variables .",
    "the importance of the stochastic nature in the evolution of cosmic mass and velocity fields has been emphasized in many works ( e.g. , berera & fang 1994 ; jones 1999 ; buchert et al .",
    "1999 ; matarrese & mohayee 2002 ; coles & spencer 2003 ; ma & bertschinger 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , in the nonlinear regime , we expect that the similarity mapping between the igm and the dark matter may no longer work .",
    "the dynamical mechanism of violating the similarity between the igm and dark matter has been discussed in the early study of structure formation ( shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "as the dark matter particles are collisionless , the velocity of the dark matter particles will be multivalued at the intersection of the dark matter particle trajectories . on the other hand the igm ,",
    "being an ideal fluid , has a single - value velocity field .",
    "thus , at the intersection of the dark matter particle trajectories , the density of gas would be discontinuous , and shocks or complex structures occur .",
    "the development of shocks or complex structures breaks the similarity between the igm and dark matter and thus leads to the statistical discrepancy between the igm distribution and dark matter mass field .",
    "strong shocks and complex structures result in the heating and the entropy increase of the igm . the cosmic baryonic gas involved in strong shocks",
    "should hence undergo an entropy increase .",
    "the dark matter remains unaffected .",
    "consequently , the igm will be in thermodynamically multiple phases .",
    "the relations between the temperature and mass density , or entropy and mass density of the igm will not be described by an single - value relation and will vary from place to place .",
    "it would be interesting to study the multiphased properties of the igm caused by the statistical discrepancy between the fields of the igm and dark matter . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the temperature and entropy fields of the igm .    aside from theoretical interests ,",
    "this study is also motivated by the problem of the so - called entropy excess , i.e. , a high entropy floor is observed in nearby groups and low - mass clusters ( ponman et al .",
    "1999 ; lloyd - davies et al .",
    "entropy excess indicates that some processes that violate the dynamical self - similar scaling are important in structure formation . to explain this result ,",
    "many models for igm preheating have been proposed , such as photoionization heating ( e.g. , efstathiou 1992 ; gnedin 2000 ) , supernova ( sn ) explosions , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activities ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "1994 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) , gravitational shocks associated with clusters ( cavaliere et al . 1998 ) or warm - hot gas ( valageas et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the decoupling of the igm and dark matter in the nonlinear regime inevitably leads to a dynamical break of the similarity between dark matter and gas .",
    "hence , the temperature and entropy fields of the igm formed by this evolution should be treated as the background or cosmological `` floor '' .",
    "the entropies produced by other mechanisms are superpositions on this background .",
    "many previous studies assumed an uniform heating of the igm all over the space ( e.g. , mo & mao 2002 ) .",
    "however , this assumption will not hold if the background temperature and entropy are inhomogeneous and multiphased",
    ". some studies of the gravitational shock heating have assumed that the heating and entropy increase occur only in nearby groups and clusters .",
    "this is to assume that shock heating occurs mainly in high - density regions .",
    "however , the decoupling evolution and gravitational shocks can happen in high mass density regions ( hosting groups and clusters ) , as well as in low mass density areas .",
    "thus , shocks can also heat the igm at low mass density areas .",
    "the last motivation for this study is the progress made in the art of numerical algorithms for hydrodynamics over the last few years .",
    "the weighted essentially nonoscillatory ( weno ) scheme ( fedkiw et al . 2003 ; shu 2003 ) has proved to be significantly superior over the piecewise smooth solution algorithm containing discontinuities .",
    "it has been successful in capturing shocks and complex structures and in calculating the entropy in both shocked and unshocked regions .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to calculate the temperature and entropy fields of the igm with this code .",
    "we analyze the temperature and entropy fields of the igm in the @xmath2cdm cosmology with simulation samples produced by a hybrid hydrodynamic/@xmath3-body code .",
    "this code effectively simulates shocks and complex structures with high precision .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the basic equations and the mechanism of the igm - dark matter discrepancy are addressed in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation scheme . in ",
    "4 we show the basic properties of the temperature field of the igm .",
    "the entropy field of the igm is calculated and analyzed in  5 .",
    "finally , in  6 we present our conclusions followed by a discussion of the results .",
    "the igm is assumed to be an ideal fluid with polytropic index @xmath20 .",

    "the term of @xmath40 in equation ( 4 ) is given by the radiative heating - cooling of the baryonic gas .",
    "the gravitational force @xmath41 is produced by the collisionless dark matter , given by @xmath42 where the operator @xmath43 acts on the comoving coordinate @xmath44 ; @xmath45/\\bar{\\rho}_{tot}$ ] , and @xmath46 is a sum of the comoving baryon and dark matter mass density .",
    "the total mean density is @xmath47 .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath48 is zero ( or constant ) when the density perturbation @xmath49 .      before embarking on the numerical calculations",
    ", we point out some qualitative features of the igm evolution given by equation ( 1 ) . to sketch the evolution of gravitational clustering , we ignore the heating and cooling .",
    "consider the case in which all thermal processes are described by the polytropic relations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 , where @xmath53/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] is the igm mass density perturbation . from equation ( 1 ) , the momentum equation is @xmath54 where the parameter @xmath55 is the mean molecular weight of the igm particles and @xmath56 is the proton mass .    for growth modes in the perturbations",
    ", velocity is irrotational .",
    "we can then define a velocity potential by @xmath57 in the linear approximation of the temperature - dependent term , equation ( 6 ) yields @xmath58 where the coefficient @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 in which @xmath61 describes the linear growth behavior .",
    "the term with @xmath59 in equation ( 8) acts like a viscosity ( due to thermal diffusion ) characterized by the jeans length @xmath62 .    since the gravitational potential @xmath48 is mainly given by the random density field of dark matter , the term @xmath48 of equation ( 8) plays the role of a random force .",
    "the nonlinear equation ( 8) is exactly the stochastic force - driven burgers equation or the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation ( kardar et al .",
    "1986 ; berera & fang 1994 ; barabsi & stanley 1995 ) . the behavior of the field @xmath63 given by equation ( 8) depends on the reynolds number , defined by @xmath64 ( e.g. , lssig 2000 ) , where @xmath65 is the comoving correlation length of the random field @xmath48 and @xmath66 is the dissipation length . in the case of equation ( 8) , the dissipation length is given by the jeans smoothing equation ( 9 ) , or @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the fourier component of the dark matter density contrast for the wavenumber @xmath70 . to derive equation ( 10 ) , we assume that the gravitational potential @xmath48 is only given by the dark matter mass perturbation .    it is well known that the burgers equation does not reduce , but increase initial chaos ( kraichnan 1968 ) .",
    "when the reynolds number ( eq . [ 10 ] ) is larger than @xmath71 , the @xmath72 field is in burgers turbulence ( e.g. , lssig 2000 ) .",
    "that is , when the reynolds number is high , an initially random field always results in a collection of shocks with a smooth and simple variation of the field between the shocks .",
    "the correlation length @xmath65 of the gravitational potential @xmath48 is larger than the jeans length , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 can be larger than 1 on scales larger than the jeans length ( @xmath75 ) , even when @xmath76 is of the order of 1 .",
    "this means that the burgers turbulence on scales larger than the jeans length can occur in the igm @xmath63 field , when the dark matter mass density perturbations are still quasi - linear or weakly nonlinear ( @xmath77 ) on those scales .",
    "this results in the decoupling of igm velocity field from that of the dark matter on scales larger than the jeans length .",
    "when the burgers turbulence develops in the igm , the field @xmath63 is characterized by strong intermittency and contains many discontinuities , or shocks .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath63 is long - tailed ( lssig 2000 ) .",
    "that is , the randomly distributed shocks and intermittent spikes lead to the statistical discrepancy between the velocity fields of the igm and dark matter .",
    "from the result of  2 , it is clear that we need to focus on shocks and discontinuities in our simulations . in the system of the igm",
    "gravitationally coupled with dark matter , the temperature of the igm generally is in the range @xmath78k , and the speed of sound in the igm is only a few km s@xmath79 to a few tens km s@xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms bulk velocity of the igm is of the order of hundreds km s@xmath79 ( zhan & fang 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the mach number of the gas can be as high as @xmath80100 ( ryu et al 2003 ) .",
    "the shocks and discontinuities are extremely strong .",
    "hence we will not use a lagrangian approach such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) algorithm . a main challenge to the sph scheme",
    "is the handling of shocks or discontinuities , because the nature of sph is to smooth the fields considered ( e.g. borve et al .",
    "2001 ; omang et al . 2003 . )",
    "we take a eulerian approach instead . a well - known problem of the eulerian algorithm",
    "are the unphysical oscillations near a discontinuity .",
    "an effective method to reduce the spurious oscillations is given by designed limiters , such as the total - variation diminishing ( tvd ) method ( harten 1983 ) and piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ; collella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "a problem of the tvd method is that the accuracy necessarily degenerates to first order near smooth extrema ( godlewski & raviart 1996 ) .",
    "this problem will cause errors in calculating the temperature and entropy changes because they are determined by the difference of the thermal energy @xmath81 on the two sides of the shock . when the mach number of gas is high ,",
    "the thermal energy @xmath81 is very small compared to the kinetic energy @xmath82 . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the essentially nonoscillatory ( eno ) and weno algorithms were proposed ( harten et al . 1986 ; shu 1998 , 2003 ; fedkiw et al .",
    "2003 ) . they can simultaneously provide a high - order precision for both the smooth part of the solution and sharp shock transition(liu",
    "1994 ; jiang & shu 1996 ) .",
    "the weno scheme weno has been successfully applied to hydrodynamic problems containing shocks and complex structures , such as shock - vortex interaction ( grasso & pirozzoli 2000a , 2000b ) , interacting blast waves ( liang & chen 1999 ; balsara & shu 2000 ) , rayleigh - taylor instability ( shi et al . 2003 ) , and mhd ( jiang & wu 1999 ) .",
    "weno has also been used to study astrophysical hydrodynamics , including stellar atmospheres ( del zanna et al .",
    "1998 ) , high reynolds number compressible flows with supernova ( zhang et al . 2003 ) , and high mach number astrophysical jets ( carrillo et al . 2003 ) . in the context of cosmological applications",
    ", weno has proved especially adept at handling the burgers equation ( shu 1999 ) .",
    "recently , a hybrid hydrodynamic/@xmath3-body code based on the weno scheme has been developed .",
    "it has passed typical tests , including the sedov blast wave and the formation of the zeldovich pancake ( feng et al .",
    "this code has been successfully used to produce the quasi - stellar object ( qso ) ly@xmath19 transmitted flux , including the high - resolution sample hp1700 + 6416 ( feng et al .",
    "the statistical features of these samples are in good agreement with observed features not only on second - order measures , like the power spectrum , but also up to orders as high as 8 for the intermittent behavior .",
    "hence , we believe that it would be reasonable to study the entropy and temperature fields of the igm with the simulation samples given by the weno scheme .      for the purpose of this paper",
    ", we run the hybrid @xmath3-body / hydrodynamic code to trace the cosmic evolution of the coupled system of both dark matter and baryonic gas in a flat low - density @xmath2cdm model , which is specified by the cosmological parameters @xmath83 .",
    "the baryon fraction is fixed using the constraint from primordial nucleosynthesis as @xmath84 ( walker et al .",
    "the linear power spectrum is taken from the fitting formulae presented by eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) .",
    "the simulations were performed in a periodic , cubic box of size 25 h@xmath79mpc with a 192@xmath85 grid and an equal number of dark matter particles .",
    "the simulations start at a redshift @xmath86 , and the results are noted at the redshifts of @xmath874.0 , 3.0 , 2.0 , 1.0 , 0.5 , and 0.0 .",

    "the second timescale is imposed by cosmic expansion , which requires that @xmath94 within a single time step .",
    "the last timescale comes from the requirement that a particle moves not more than a fixed fraction of the cell size .",

    "figure 1 shows clearly that the relations between the density and velocity fields of the dark matter and igm are very complex .",
    "the density and velocity fields of the igm are not always faithful tracers of the underlying dark matter fields , although in the linear regime they are point - by - point tracers on scales larger than the jeans length ( bi et al .",
    "1992 ; fang et al . 1993 ; bi 1993 ; nusser 2000 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) .",
    "many of the discrepancies between the igm and dark matter fields shown in figure 1 can be explained by the jeans smoothing ( theuns et al .",
    "however , figure 1 shows that several differences between the mass fields of the igm and dark matter are on scales of a few @xmath107 mpc , which is larger than the corresponding jeans length of the igm .    the big jump in the igm temperature around the position @xmath108 @xmath107 mpc is typically caused by a strong shock .",
    "the temperature of the preshocked gas is @xmath8010@xmath109k and increases to @xmath110k by the shock . in this case , the temperature increases by a factor of @xmath111 .",

    "; theuns et al . 1998 ; dav et al . 1999 ;",
    "valageas et al . 2002 ; springel & hernquist 2002 ) . roughly speaking",
    ", there are two phases in the @xmath115 plane .",
    "( 1 ) the first phase manifests a tight correlation in the bottom left regions @xmath0 ( @xmath116k ) and @xmath117 , and ( 2 ) the second phase lies above the tight correlation regions and has a scattered distribution in which the temperature generally is greater than @xmath118k .    the tight correlation lines can be well approximated by a power law as @xmath119 with @xmath19 slightly increasing from @xmath800.61 at @xmath104=4 to @xmath800.69 at @xmath104=0 , which is the same as the so - called igm equation of state given by hui & gnedin ( 1997 ) .",
    "the small discrepancy of @xmath19 from the adiabatic index @xmath120 results from the photoionization heating and radiative cooling ( valageas et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the gas in phase 2 sometimes is called the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , as its temperature is @xmath121 k , i.e. , higher than the gas in phase 1 by a factor of about 10  10@xmath85 ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) . from figure 2",
    "we can see that the whim underwent a significant evolution from redshift @xmath122 to the present . at @xmath122 whim events are rare and mostly reside in the regions of mass density , @xmath123 , while whim becomes quite common when @xmath124 .",
    "note that the high - temperature ( @xmath125 k ) events , and hence strong shocks , can also occur in the regions with density @xmath126 , and even @xmath127 .",
    "in other words , the case shown in figure 1 is common .    comparing with numerical results cited above by other groups ,",
    "phase 2 gas is more significant in our simulation . especially in the low mass density ( @xmath128 ) regions ,",
    "the phase 2 in figure 2 is pronounced .",
    "this is because the weno code is more effective in capturing shocks in both high- and low - density regions .      from figure 1",
    "we have already seen the discrepancy between the igm and dark matter fields .",
    "the @xmath129 ratios are not equal to unity everywhere .",
    "hence , the baryonic fraction is not always equal to the cosmological average value @xmath130 . to show this deviation , we plot the relationships between the mean baryonic fraction and temperature in figure 3 .",
    "it is obvious that the baryon fraction at @xmath131 significantly exceeds the cosmological value @xmath132 for the whim ( at @xmath133k @xmath134 k ) .",
    "this is a well - known result nowadays ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "the concentration of baryons into whim can be seen as follows .",
    "the gas is compressed by a factor of @xmath135 by strong shocks .",
    "on the other hand , the dark matter mass density at the pre- and postshock is almost the same .",
    "thus , the baryon fraction in the postshocked igm can be enhanced as high as @xmath136 .",
    "this result is consistent with what is shown in figure 3 .",
    "however , whim may not necessarily reside in dense regions . in figure 4",
    "we present a cumulative probability distribution @xmath137 for whim ( @xmath138 k ) at different redshifts , which is the fraction of whim with dark matter density larger than @xmath5 .",
    "note that we use the dark matter density @xmath5 in figure 4 , not @xmath4 , as massive dark halos should be identified by high @xmath5 , rather than by high @xmath4 .",
    "if gravitational collapsing or collapsed regions are characterized by @xmath139 , figure 4 shows that most of whim at @xmath140 does not reside in or close to massive dark halos . in other words",
    ", many strong shocks may not be due to the accretion by the filaments of dark matter .",
    "one should not simply identify all whim as dense clouds or massive halos .",
    "the multiphased features of the temperature field can be described by the pdf of the temperature field .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "we use three density ranges : ( 1 ) low , @xmath141 , ( 2 ) medium , @xmath142 , and ( 3 ) high , @xmath143 .",
    "all pdfs have similar shape but shift to higher temperature with higher density .",
    "the pdfs are sharply peaked at some low temperatures , while some have long tails on the high - temperature side .",
    "the tails are approximately given by a power law @xmath144 with the index @xmath145 at @xmath122 , and @xmath146 at @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the high - temperature tails are prolonged at low redshifts .",
    "a field with such power - law - tailed pdf is typically intermittent ( nakao 1998 ) .",
    "we also calculate the @xmath148 diagram , which shows the similar result of multiphased structure as the @xmath115 diagram .",
    "we show in figure 6 the relations between the mean temperature @xmath149 and the dark matter mass density @xmath5 .",
    "one can see that @xmath149 is actually inadequate to describe the temperature field if the field is long - tailed , or multiphased . from figure 6",
    "we can see that @xmath149 at redshifts @xmath150 and @xmath151 is in the range @xmath152 k. however , figure 5 shows that in the range @xmath151 the probability for temperature of @xmath153k is comparable to the probability for @xmath154 k. therefore , the igm can not be approximately modeled as a single phase gas with temperature of either @xmath155 k or @xmath153k .    in figure 6",
    "each panel has three @xmath156 curves , which correspond to the data smoothed by windows on scales 0.26 , 1.04 and 4.17 h@xmath79 mpc , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to see that the @xmath157 relations are basically independent of the smoothing scales .",
    "therefore , the multiphased feature of the igm temperature does not come from the sampling , but from the non - gaussian pdf of the field .",
    "such a field is substantially different from a uniform or a gaussian field .",
    "the @xmath156 relation of whim given by dav et al . ( 2001 ) is approximately @xmath158 .",
    "from figure 6 we can also see @xmath158 . however , they are different .",
    "the mean @xmath149 in figure 6 is given by averaging over all pixels including both the whim and the gas with low ( @xmath159 k ) temperature , since the @xmath160 relation for low ( @xmath159 k ) temperatures is @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , for whim only , we may have @xmath161 and @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , figure 6 shows again that our samples contain more shock - heated events .",
    "the entropy of the igm is measured by the parameter @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the number density of baryons .",
    "it is actually related to the entropy density @xmath166 of the igm by @xmath167 const .",
    "as we will not use @xmath166 below , we use this notation for the entropy parameter or simply entropy , @xmath168 .",
    "if temperature @xmath0 is in units of kev ( 1 kev @xmath169 k ) , entropy @xmath1 is in units of kev @xmath7 .",
    "figure 7 presents the relation between the entropy and temperature of the igm at @xmath87 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0.5 , and 0 for the 19,200 data randomly drawn from the total 192@xmath85 data points .",
    "figure 7 also shows the two phases of the igm : ( 1 ) a tight correlation along a line of @xmath170 const at the bottom of the figure , i.e. , the entropy of the igm is independent of igm temperature , and ( 2 ) a scattered distribution above the tight correlation line .",
    "they are the same as figure 2 .",
    "the gas in phase 1 approximately satisfies @xmath171 .",
    "the gas in phase 2 experiences an entropy increase process , mainly because of the heating by shocks and complex structures in the igm .",
    "a strong shock increases @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath172 , @xmath165 by a factor of @xmath804 , and therefore , the postshocked entropy can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "phase 2 shows a significant evolution from redshift @xmath122 to the present .",
    "there are almost no high - entropy ( @xmath173 h@xmath174 kev @xmath175 ) events when @xmath122 . at @xmath176 and 3 ,",
    "high - entropy events are biased to @xmath177 kev regions . when @xmath131 , high - entropy events occur in all temperatures @xmath178 kev , or greater than @xmath95 k ranges .",
    "the @xmath1 - @xmath5 diagram is shown in figure 8 .",
    "we again use @xmath5 , not @xmath4 , as the clustering of the mass field is indicated by high-@xmath5 .",
    "although @xmath4 does not trace @xmath5 point by point , one can still see the two phases : a dense distribution along a line of constant @xmath1 , and a scattered distribution above the line , given by the entropy increase because of shocks . for redshift @xmath179",
    ", the gas in phase 2 can reside in both low ( @xmath114 ) and high ( @xmath180 ) dark matter density areas .",
    "figure 9a presents the mean entropy @xmath181 versus density @xmath5 .",
    "the entropy of the igm increases by about 2 orders of magnitude from redshift @xmath122 to 0.5 . in the redshift range @xmath182 , the mean entropy @xmath181 is higher in higher density areas . for dark matter mass density @xmath12 ,",
    "the mean entropy @xmath183 is greater than 60 h@xmath174 kev @xmath7 at the epoch @xmath184 , and greater than 20 h@xmath174 kev @xmath7 at @xmath185 . at @xmath186 ,",
    "the shocks and complicated structures yield an `` entropy floor '' @xmath187 kev @xmath175 at @xmath186 over the entire igm from low - density ( @xmath188 ) areas to high - density ( @xmath189 ) regions .",
    "this is the cosmological background of entropy floor generated by the nonlinear evolution of the igm in the gravity of dark matter .    in figure",
    "9b we show the @xmath181 - @xmath4 relation for samples produced by the same cosmological parameters , but without considering radiative cooling and photoionization heating .",
    "we see that the relation @xmath181 - @xmath4 at @xmath190 in figure 9b is about the same as that of figure 9a . especially in the high - density range ( @xmath139 ) , figures 9a and 9b are the same .",
    "therefore , the entropy increase of the igm at @xmath191 shown in figure 9a is not due to the heating and cooling , but mainly determined by shocks and complicated structures .",
    "the effects of radiative cooling and heating to the entropy evolution are negligible at @xmath191 and high - density areas . at",
    "higher redshift @xmath192 and low - density areas , however , the effects of radiative cooling and heating become important .",
    "it is interesting to compare our result of the entropy floor with the semi - analytical estimation by valageas et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter vss03 ) . using the data of dav",
    "et al ( 2001 ) , they found that whim can provide an entropy floor ( or the mean @xmath193 ) of the order of 10@xmath194 kev @xmath175 at @xmath186 , which is about the same as figure 9 .",
    "however , their result is given by an average of @xmath1 over all whim .",
    "as has been pointed out in  3.2 , most whim at @xmath191 does not reside in high - density areas .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether the high - entropy floor given by an overall average of the whim is in the high - density areas .",
    "moreover , the average of @xmath1 in vss03 is done by the method of adiabatically bringing all patches into a same effective density . with this method",
    ", the low - density areas would have significant contribution to the mean @xmath1 . in our study , the mean of @xmath1 is taken in each given bin of the dark matter density , and therefore from figure 9 one can unambiguously conclude that the high - entropy floor of @xmath80 10@xmath194 kev @xmath175 first formed in high - density @xmath139 areas since @xmath195 , i.e. , the areas that are favored by the formation of galaxy clusters .",
    "moreover , the mean of @xmath1 given by vss03 falls steeply with redshift .",
    "vss03 found @xmath196 kev @xmath175 at @xmath197 .",
    "figure 9 also shows the decrease of @xmath183 with redshift .",
    "however , it is much slower than that of the vss03 .",
    "figure 9 shows that the entropy floor is still @xmath198 kev @xmath175 when @xmath199 and @xmath139 . the difference between the redshift dependence of the vss03 and figure 9",
    "is caused by two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the number of @xmath183 of the vss03 is given by an average over all density regions , and figure 9 shows that the decrease of @xmath183 with redshift is faster in lower density ( @xmath200 ) regions ; and ( 2 ) the weno code is more effective in describing shocks than the data used in vss03 .      at first glance",
    ", the mean entropy of figure 9 may contradict the ly@xmath19 absorption in qso s absorption spectrum .",
    "a uniform entropy floor @xmath201 100 h@xmath174 kev @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath202 k at @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "this temperature is obviously unacceptable with the observations of ly@xmath19 forest lines .",
    "even for a uniform entropy floor as small as 10 @xmath205 kev @xmath7 , the igm temperature is about 4@xmath206 k at @xmath176 and @xmath204 .",
    "this is also contradictory with the small - scale intermittent spikes in the transmitted flux of qso s ly@xmath19 absorption .",
    "this argument is often used to constrain preheating models .",
    "however , this argument no longer holds if the igm is multiphased .",
    "this can be seen from the pdf of the entropy field .",
    "similar to the temperature field , the entropy field is also highly non - gaussian .",
    "figure 10 presents the pdfs of the entropy field at redshifts from @xmath122 to 0 .",
    "the shapes of the pdfs at different redshifts are similar , but the curves shift to higher @xmath1 at lower @xmath104 .",
    "the pdfs are peaked at the low - entropy end and gradually decrease with the increasing @xmath1 by a power law @xmath207 with @xmath208 at @xmath209 and @xmath210 at @xmath211 .",
    "that is , the tail is longer when the redshift @xmath104 decreases .",
    "therefore , in terms of entropy , the igm is also in multiple phases .",
    "high- and low - entropy gas coexist in the igm .",
    "in this case , the mean entropy , @xmath181 , does not mean uniform heating .",
    "for a long - tailed pdf , the mean is much larger than the median .",
    "thus , most of the space actually has entropy @xmath1 less than the mean .",
    "figure 11 gives the volume filling factor @xmath212 , which is the volume fraction with entropy larger than a given @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that the volume fraction of high entropy ( @xmath213 kev @xmath175 ) is very small for all redshifts .",
    "although the mean entropy @xmath181 is as high as @xmath214 kev @xmath175 at @xmath147 ( figure 9a ) , the volume fraction @xmath215 is only about 10% .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the high- and low - entropy phases can coexist in the igm .",
    "to approximate such a multiphased field by a uniform distribution would be misleading .",
    "we now study the distribution of entropy of the igm in mass space .",
    "we are interested in the regions with high entropy and high density , as they provide the environment of baryonic structure formation .",
    "let us consider the regions with high dark matter density @xmath216 or 10 to be the hosts of collapsed baryonic clumps .",
    "figure 12 shows the baryonic mass fraction @xmath217 of regions with the entropy larger than a given @xmath1 and dark matter density @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "first , we see from figure 12 that @xmath220 at @xmath147 for either @xmath221 or @xmath219 . that is , at @xmath147 , no high - density regions @xmath221 have entropy less than @xmath222 kev @xmath175 . at higher @xmath104 ,",
    "the mass fraction with higher entropy becomes smaller .",
    "nevertheless , there are already @xmath223 baryons at @xmath184 to have entropy greater than @xmath224 kev @xmath175 .",
    "this feature is not sensitive to whether @xmath225 or 10 .",
    "since the baryon fraction in collapsed halos is about 10% , we may conclude that all structure formation is probably in the entropy environment of @xmath226 kev @xmath175 if the gas falls into the halos not earlier than @xmath184 .",
    "in calculating figure 12 , the mass field @xmath5 was decomposed to the size of the resolution of the simulation , which is 0.13 @xmath107 mpc . to study the scale dependence of the entropy floor , we decomposed the dark matter mass field and entropy field into different scales",
    ". this decomposition can be done by the orthogonal scaling functions of discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) . as has been showed ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) , the high - density regions on the scale 1.5 @xmath107 mpc given by the dwt decomposition can be identified as clusters , which yields the same result as traditional identification schemes , such as the friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "figure 13 presents the relations between the mean entropy @xmath181 and @xmath5 for the mass field decomposed by the dwt scaling function on scales @xmath227 0.26 , 1.04 and 4.17 @xmath107 mpc .",
    "the mean @xmath181 in figure 13 is given by averaging over all regions that are on the given scale and have the dark matter density @xmath5 in a given bin .",
    "therefore , @xmath181 at @xmath227 1.04 @xmath107 and @xmath139 is the mean entropy of the igm in the regions that host the formation of groups and clusters .",
    "figure 13 also shows that the @xmath181-@xmath5 relations are basically scale - independent when @xmath228 . at small redshifts @xmath191",
    ", however , one can see that the larger the size @xmath103 , the higher the mean entropy is in high - density regions .",
    "that is , the high - entropy igm is biased to the places that have high dark matter density in a large size area .",
    "this is probably because more shocks occur around massive halos .",
    "thus , at epochs @xmath229 , massive halos are generally surrounded by high - entropy baryonic gas .",
    "this result shows again that the entropy floor in the regions with high mass density and on large scales is generally larger than the estimation by an over - all average ( vss03 ) .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the temperature and entropy fields of the igm in the nonlinear regime of gravitational clustering . we have used the @xmath3-body / hydrodynamic simulation samples produced by the weno code , which effectively describes shocks .",
    "strong shocks can significantly change the mass density and velocity of the igm fluid , at the same time having no effect on the dark matter field .",
    "therefore , when the shocks emerge , the dynamical similarity between the igm and dark matter is broken .",
    "the gravitational shocks and complex structures of the igm can take place in nearby massive dark halos as well as in low mass density regions .",
    "the entropy production by shocks makes the igm multiphased .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 and entropy @xmath1 of the igm are no longer related to the mass density @xmath4 or @xmath5 by a single - value relation .",
    "the igm contains gas in both high- and low - entropy phases , or both high- and low - temperature phases . for a given @xmath4 or @xmath5 ,",
    "the igm temperature and entropy lie in very wide ranges from @xmath8010@xmath109 to @xmath8010@xmath230 k , and from @xmath801 to @xmath8010@xmath231 kev @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the temperature and entropy fields of the igm can not be approximately described by a randomly uniform gaussian distribution .",
    "we should point out that star formation and their feedback on the igm evolution are not considered in our simulation . roughly , there are two types of the feedbacks : ( 1 ) photoionization heating by the uv emission of stars and agns , and ( 2 ) injection of hot gas and energy by sn explosions or other sources of cosmic rays .",
    "the photoionization heating actually can be properly considered if the uv background is adjusted by fitting the simulation with observed mean flux decrement of qso s ly@xmath19 absorption spectrum ( feng et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the effect of injecting hot gas and energy by sns is localized in massive halos .",
    "for instance , metal absorption systems ( like civ and mgii ) in qso spectra are generally associated with collapsed halos ( e.g. , bi & fang 1996 ) . a recent ly@xmath19 observation around protoclusters ( adelberger et al .",
    "2003 ) implies that agn heating does not drastically affect the gas in clusters . nor",
    "does it affect the igm in low - density areas .",
    "therefore , these heating mechanisms are probably not strong enough to change the basic feature of the multiphased temperature and entropy field given in this paper .",
    "entropy floor of groups and clusters.for all regions on scales greater than @xmath11 mpc and with dark matter mass density @xmath12 , the mean entropy @xmath183 , or entropy floor , is greater than 80 @xmath205 kev @xmath7 since the epoch @xmath184 and greater than 20 @xmath205 kev @xmath7 at @xmath185 . even for regions of @xmath139 ,",
    "the mean entropy still have @xmath232 kev @xmath7 at the epoch @xmath184 and 10 @xmath205 kev @xmath7 at @xmath185 ( fig .",
    "therefore , gravitational shock is an important provider of high - entropy gas around massive halos , which are the hosts of clusters and groups .",
    "this result is adequate to explain the entropy excess from the observations of clusters and groups if the epoch of the gas falling in cluster cores is not earlier than @xmath233 ( ponman et al .",
    "in other words , the igm is already significantly preheated by gravitational shocks at the epoch @xmath14 , and therefore other sources of heating may not be important if the cluster core with entropy excess formed after that epoch ( kay & bower 1999 ; borgani et al 2002 ) .",
    "ly@xmath19 forest lines.the ly@xmath19 forest lines in qso s absorption spectrum of @xmath234 have a column density @xmath235 of hi atoms in the range @xmath236 , which corresponds to areas of @xmath237 ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "the thermal broadening of these lines shows that the temperature of the igm at this density area is about @xmath238k .",
    "the high - entropy floor ( @xmath239 kev @xmath7 ) will contradict the ly@xmath19 forest if the entropy field is uniform .",
    "however , the temperature and entropy fields are highly non - gaussian and of multiple phases . the volume of the universe is actually dominated by regions of low temperature and low mass density . for all redshifts @xmath15 , more than 90% volume with dark matter mass density ( @xmath17 )",
    "is occupied by the igm with temperature less than @xmath18k ( fig .",
    "this provides the room for the qso s ly@xmath19 forests .",
    "the mean temperature is higher for lower redshifts ( fig .",
    "therefore , the number density of the forests lines , or absorbers , is lower at lower redshifts .",
    "these properties match the constraints on the igm from qso s ly@xmath19 forests .",
    "moreover , the ly@xmath19 forests are very well modeled by the semianalytical lognormal model , which assumes that the pdf of the igm mass density field is lognormal , and long - tailed ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "this assumption basically is consistent with the long - tailed pdf of igm temperature field ( fig .",
    "intermittency of ly@xmath19 transmitted flux.the ly@xmath19 transmitted flux of the qso s absorption spectrum is found to be remarkably intermittent ( jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "that is , the power of the flux fluctuations concentrates in the rare spikes .",
    "the intermittent features can be detected even on scales corresponding to thermal broadening of gas with @xmath240 k. different from ly@xmath19 forests , the intermittency of the ly@xmath19 transmitted flux does not become weaker , but become even stronger at lower redshifts .",
    "it is impossible to explain the intermittency with single - phase igm with temperature @xmath241 k. however , strong shocks yield many big discontinuities of the igm temperature ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and therefore the power of the temperature fluctuations is also spiky . the long - tailed pdfs also reflect the intermittency of the temperature field .",
    "the lower the redshifts , the longer the tails , and therefore the intermittent features are more prominent at lower redshifts",
    ". moreover , the igm at density @xmath237 regions contains components of @xmath242 k as well as of @xmath243 k. therefore , the intermittency of the ly@xmath19 transmitted flux can be well fitted with these simulation samples ( pando et al . 2002 ; feng et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all these results are in good agreement with the theoretical expectation of  2 . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", the reynolds number is larger and leads to the burgers turbulence .",
    "therefore , the gravitational shock in the igm provides a unified explanation of the features of the igm in both low- and higher density regions .",
    "it includes the departure of the igm - dark matter similarity mapping , formation of the entropy excess groups and clusters , the temperature and entropy in the regions of ly@xmath19 forests and the intermittency of ly@xmath19 transmitted flux .",
