    "there is ample observational evidence to suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , fuelled perhaps by _ dark energy _ ( de ) which violates the strong energy condition , so that @xmath9 .",
    "while the cosmological constant with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , envisioned by einstein almost a century ago , fulfills this requirement , the tiny value associated with @xmath4 has prompted theorists to look for alternatives in which dark energy evolves with time including modified gravity @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the very simplicity of the cosmological constant has prompted the search for _ null - diagnostics _ which can inform us , on the basis of observations , whether or not de is the cosmological constant .",
    "one such diagnostic is the _ statefinder _ @xmath12 ( also called the jerk ) whose value stays pegged to unity _ only in _",
    "@xcite ( also see@xcite ) . thus if observations were to inform us that @xmath13 , then this would imply a falsification of the cosmological constant hypothesis .",
    "a second null diagnostic , @xmath14 , is defined as @xcite om(z ) =  ,   = h(z)/h_0  .",
    "[ eq : om ] a remarkable feature of @xmath1 is that its value remains pegged to @xmath15 in @xmath4cdm . in all other de models the value of @xmath14 _ evolves with time_.    while the statefinder has proved exceedingly versatile in differentiating between rival de models , a distinguishing feature of @xmath1 is that it depends only upon the expansion rate , @xmath0 , and is therefore easier to determine from observations than @xmath16 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 can also be written as a two - point diagnostic @xcite om(z_i;z_j ) = , [ eq : om1 ] with @xmath17 defined in ( [ eq : om ] ) . consequently , if the hubble parameter is known at two or more redshifts then @xmath18 can be reconstructed and one can address the issue of whether de is the cosmological constant or not .",
    "recent observations of bao s in the sdss catalogue have paved the way for reconstructing @xmath1 by determining statistically independent values of @xmath0 at several redshifts @xcite . using their determination of @xmath19 km / sec / mpc",
    ", @xcite reported a surprising 2 - 2.5@xmath20 tension with the predictions of standard @xmath4cdm with best - fit planck parameters . in this paper",
    "we revisit this inconsistency using a null diagnostic approach involving an improved version of @xmath1 .",
    "we affirm the results of @xcite and also demonstrate that _ screened _ models of dark energy provide a better fit to the bao data than @xmath4cdm .",
    "( it may be appropriate to mention that @xcite is a preprint and it is possible that these results be revised prior to publication . )",
    "an advantage of using bao s to deduce the nature of de is that the former are measured on large scales and hence determined primarily by the linear regime of gravitational instability , a theory that has been meticulously developed and studied over the past several decades . in this letter",
    "we reconstruct @xmath1 using recent determinations of @xmath0 and attempt to answer the question as to whether de behaves like the cosmological constant . consider first , the following small improvement of @xmath1 which yields large dividents . multiplying both sides of ( [ eq : om1 ] ) by @xmath21 where @xmath22km / sec / mpc , results in the _ improved @xmath1 diagnostic _",

    "consequently , a departure of @xmath5 from the above value would signal that de _ is not _ @xmath4 . as we shall show , this is precisely what is suggested by the recent measurement of @xmath2 km / sec / mpc at @xmath3 made on the basis of bao s in the @xmath25 forest of boss dr11 quasars @xcite .",
    "one notes that for @xmath26 independent measurements of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the pairwise diagnostic @xmath29 can be determined in @xmath30 different ways . in the present case @xmath31 , which leads to 3 independent measurements of @xmath29 , namely omh^2(z_1;z_2 ) & = & 0.124 0.045 + omh^2(z_1;z_3 ) & = & 0.122 0.010 + omh^2(z_2;z_3 ) &",

    "one notes from ( [ eq : omh2 ] ) that the _ model independent _ value of @xmath35 is quite stable , and is in tension with the @xmath4cdm - based value @xmath36 . for the pair @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "the tension with @xmath4 is at over @xmath39 .",
    "we should note here that these results are quite robust and not unduly sensitive to the value of @xmath40 .",
    "assuming @xmath41 km / sec / mpc , which is the best estimated value by  @xcite , results in @xmath42 . while using @xmath43 , which is the best fit value for hubble parameter from planck concordance @xmath4cdm model , results in @xmath44 .",
    "hence it is clear that the ` final ' value of @xmath40 should not affect the derived value of @xmath5 significantly , which suggests that our results for this quantity are robust . likewise using the more recent sdss galaxy bao dr10 and dr11 result of @xmath45 km / sec / mpc @xcite we get @xmath46 which is in agreement with our earlier estimations of @xmath5 .",
    "this is mainly due to the high precision measurement of @xmath47 which makes the determination of @xmath5 less sensitive to the value of @xmath0 at lower redshifts .",
    "thus far our treatment has been model independent and we have refrained from commenting on the physical implications of the sdss measurements of @xmath0 . however , as already noted in @xcite , these implications can be quite serious .",
    "indeed the expansion rate at @xmath48 , namely @xmath19 km / sec / mpc @xcite , could be in tension not only with @xmath4cdm but with de models based on the general relativistic equation ( @xmath49 ) h^2(z ) = _ de(z ) + _ 0 m ( 1+z)^3   with  _",

    "this might imply one of the following : ( i ) @xmath53 at high @xmath54 @xcite , ( ii ) there is non - conservation of matter so that ( [ eq : gr ] ) does not hold , ( iii ) the framework ( [ eq : gr ] ) is inadequate since one could be dealing with a _ modified gravity _ theory .",

    "the _ effective _ equation of state of dark energy , @xmath63 , develops a pole , at which @xmath64 .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] the expansion rate in this model can drop below that in @xmath4cdm at high @xmath54 .",
    "it can therefore better account for the lower - than - anticipated value for @xmath47 discussed in @xcite .",
    "note also the pole in @xmath63 at @xmath75 .",
    "it might be mentioned that the presence of the pole in this model does not signal any pathologies since @xmath63 is an _ effective _ equation of state .",
    "this is also true for the other theoretical models in which @xmath63 exhibits a pole @xcite .",
    "note that a pole in the equation of state may be possible to pick out in future type ia supernova ( snia ) data sets using model independent reconstruction , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "finally one might point out that although dark energy in the braneworld behaves like a phantom it does not share the latter s pathologies @xcite .",
    "the model also agrees with snia observations @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of models with screened / compensated dark energy will be the subject of a future work .",
    "@xmath76 \\includegraphics[scale=0.45 , angle=-90]{f1.ps } \\includegraphics[scale=0.45 , angle=-90]{f2.ps } \\end{array}$ ]    there is another important issue that requires elaboration .",
    "the derived value of @xmath47 given by  @xcite is scaled at @xmath77 mpc from the planck+wp fitting of concordance cosmology , where @xmath78 is the sound horizon at the drag epoch .",
    "one may argue that playing with the parameter , @xmath78 , may help reconcile the concordance model with data .",
    "however this can not be true since the value of @xmath78 used to derive @xmath47 has been obtained assuming @xmath4cdm and the discrepancy between @xmath5 and @xmath79 obtained by us is also based on @xmath4cdm cosmology  see ( [ eq : concordance ] ) .",
    "one should however note that it is possible to lower the value of @xmath78 by increasing the expansion rate in the early universe through the inclusion of an extra relativistic species .",
    "but this would imply a departure from the minimal standard @xmath4cdm model ( though not in its dark energy sector ) .",
    "its also important to point out that a lower ( than in @xmath4cdm ) value of @xmath0 at high @xmath54 would affect the growth of matter density perturbations , perhaps speeding them up relative to @xmath4cdm .",
    "indeed , on scales much smaller than the horizon and within the framework of general relativity , linearized perturbations are described by the equation @xcite + 2h - 4g|= 0  .",
    "[ eq : pert ] clearly a lower value of @xmath0 results in a suppression of the damping term @xmath80 ( relative to @xmath4cdm ) and therefore to a faster growth in @xmath81 .",
    "this could have important implications for structure formation which will soon be probed to great depth and accuracy by ska , lsst , etc .",
    "however , ( [ eq : pert ] ) generically does not hold in modified gravity theories .",
    "in particular , in scalar - tensor gravity this equation has formally the same form at sufficiently small scales but with the effective gravitational constant @xmath82 instead of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "therefore a detailed analysis of perturbation growth in such models needs to be carried out before firm predictions can be made about @xmath84 .",
    "to summarise , this short letter demonstrates that the recent estimation of @xmath47 from bao observations in the sdss dr11 data is in tension with cmb observations assuming standard @xmath4cdm .",
    "this tension is independent of the current value of the hubble parameter @xmath40 . in our analysis",
    "we have implemented an improved version of the @xmath1 diagnostic , called @xmath5 , which can be derived by having independent measurements of @xmath0 at two redshifts .",
    "@xmath5 should be equal to @xmath85 if the universe corresponds to spatially flat @xmath4cdm .",
    "our estimated value of @xmath6 ( which should also be the value of @xmath85 for @xmath4cdm ) is robust against variations of the hubble parameter @xmath86 and is in strong tension with @xmath8 given by planck+wp .    in the absence of systematics in the cmb & sdss data sets ,",
    "our results suggest a strong tension between concordance cosmology and observational data .",
    "since resolving this discrepancy by changing initial conditions and/or the form of the primordial spectrum might be difficult ( note that @xmath85 does not change much if one deviates smoothly from the power - law form of the primordial spectrum  @xcite ) , allowing dark energy to evolve seems to be the most plausible approach to this problem .",
    "evolving dark energy models which might accommodate the sdss data better than @xmath4cdm include those in which the cosmological constant was _ screened _ in the past .",
    "the effective equation of state in such models develops a pole at high @xmath54 , which emerges as a _ smoking gun _ test for such scenarios .",
