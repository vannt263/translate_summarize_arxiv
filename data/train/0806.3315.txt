    "is great interest in the field of current - driven magnetization dynamics ( cdmd ) because of its potential applications to non - volatile magnetic random access memory and microwave devices .",
    "the concept of cdmd was first proposed by slonczewski [ 1 ] and independently by berger [ 2 ] in 1996 . in the last decade , many experimental studies have shown the evidences of cdmd [ 3],[4 ] .",

    "the origin of the cdmd has been understood as the transfer of spin angular momentum of the conducting electrons to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic metal .",
    "one of the most important quantities in cdmd is the penetration depth of the transverse ( perpendicular to the magnetization ) spin current @xmath0 , over which the transfer of spin angular momentum is achived .",
    "however , there is a controversial issue regarding the penetration depth of the transverse spin current .",
    "the ballistic theory of electron transport argues that @xmath0 is on the order of the lattice constant in conventional ferromagnets such as fe , co and ni , and their alloys [ 7],[8 ] . on the other hand",
    ", the boltzmann theory of electron transport argues that @xmath0 is on the order of a few nm [ 9],[10],[11 ] .",
    "however , only a few experimental measurements of the penetration depth has been reported [ 12],[13 ] .    in our previous paper",
    "[ 14 ] , we studied the line width of the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) spectrum in a ferromagnetic(f)/nonmagnetic(n ) metal five - layer system ( n@xmath1/f@xmath1/n@xmath2/f@xmath2/n@xmath3 ) , and showed that the line width of the f@xmath1 layer depends on the thickness of the f@xmath2 layer due to spin pumping [ 15],[16 ] . analyzing the fmr spectrum ,",
    "the penetration depth of the transverse spin current of nife , cofe and cofeb were obtained [ 14 ] .",
    "our result seems to support the boltzmann theory of electron transport .",

    "the precession axis of @xmath7 is along the direction of the magnetization of the f@xmath2 layer ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "since the magnetization vector of @xmath11 is perpendicular to @xmath7 [ 14 ] and the precession angle @xmath9 is very small ( about 1 deg ) , the dominant component of the magnetization vector of spin current flowing into the f@xmath2 layer is perpendicular to @xmath10 , i.e. , the dominant component of the spin current flowing into the f@xmath2 layer is the transverse spin current .",
