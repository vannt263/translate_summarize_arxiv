    "construction of the universal potential energy function for molecules has been a challenging and active field of research in chemical physics .",
    "the reason for this is that the potential energy function succinctly carries the necessary informations relevant for a molecule .",
    "thus , an enormous number of such functions have been proposed over the years , after the publication of three - parameter , exponential morse potential @xcite about 85 years ago .",
    "the literature is huge ; the following reference gives some of the older as well as relatively newer empirical functions @xcite .",
    "usually , larger the number of parameters in the analytical potential energy function , better the fit with experimental data .",
    "while a few of these such as morse , mie - type and pseudoharmonic potentials offer _ exact _ analytic solutions @xcite , most of these unfortunately can not be analytically solved for arbitrary vibrational and rotational quantum numbers .",
    "this necessitates the use of approximation schemes for their solutions .",
    "recently some attention has been paid on an analytic tietz - hua ( th ) model potential @xcite for ro - vibrational levels in diatomic molecules , expressed in the following form , @xmath4 ^ 2 ; \\ \\ \\ b_h=\\beta ( 1-c_h),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 relates to the molecular bond length , @xmath6 the morse constant , @xmath7 signifies the potential well depth , @xmath8 denotes the internuclear distance , while @xmath9 implies an optimization parameter obtained from _ ab initio _ or rydberg - klein - rees intramolecular potentials respectively . note that in the limit of potential constant @xmath9 approaching zero , th potential reduces to the familiar morse potential @xcite .",
    "this potential supposedly describes the molecular dynamics ( especially at high rotational and vibrational quantum numbers ) more realistically than the traditional morse potential @xcite .",
    "also it has been noted that this usually fits the experimental rydberg - klein - rees curve more closely than the morse function , especially near the dissociation limit @xcite . in another study , using hamilton - jacobi theory in conjunction with bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , analytical expressions for rotational - vibrational levels of diatomic molecules within th model have been derived @xcite .",
    "radial probability distributions of some diatomic molecules in excited rotational - vibrational states have also been reported using this route @xcite .",
    "very recently , _ exact _ analytical solution of the radial schrdinger equation with th potential has been provided for @xmath10 waves within a parametric nikiforov - uvarov method @xcite . in another development ,",
    "approximate analytical solutions of the dirac equation with th potential were obtained for arbitrary spin - orbit quantum number using the pekeris scheme @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to offer approximate solution of radial schrdinger equation with th potential for molecules .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath0 states of this potential can be obtained in closed analytic form ; while eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath11 states of th oscillator has not yet been reported in the literature , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "here we take the help of generalized pseudospectral method ( gps ) for an optimal effective discretization of the relevant schrdinger equation .",
    "this method has produced very promising results for a number of situations having physical , chemical interest , including structure , dynamics in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "accurate eigenvalues , eigenfunctions were obtained for low as well as higher states for a class of potentials such as spiked harmonic oscillators , logarithmic , rational , power - law , hulthn , yukawa , exponentially screened coulomb potentials , etc . @xcite .",
    "thus we make a detailed study on the bound - state spectrum of th oscillator with particular reference to diatomic molecules .",
    "ro - vibrational energies and radial densities are studied for both @xmath10-wave and _ rotational _ sates having _ arbitrary _ low and high vibrational quantum number .",
    "this will also enable us to judge the viability and feasibility of current approach in the context of diatomic molecular potentials .",
    "to this end , arbitrary @xmath12 states are reported for six molecules , _ viz .",
    "_ , h@xmath1 , hf , n@xmath1 , no , o@xmath1 , o@xmath2 . comparison with literature data are made wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows . a brief overview of the adopted method is given in section ii .",
    "then a discussion of the results is presented in section iii , while we conclude with a few remarks in section iv .",
    "this method has been discussed in detail earlier ( see the references @xcite and therein ) .",
    "thus it suffices to present here only a brief summary of the essential steps involved .    without loss of generality , the desired time - independent radial schrdinger equation , to be solved ,",
    "can be written as ( atomic units employed unless otherwise mentioned ) , @xmath13 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)=e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the th potential , as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , while @xmath15 , @xmath16 signify the radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .",
    "the gps formalism facilitates the use of a denser mesh at small distance and relatively coarser mesh at large distance preserving similar accuracy at both the regions .",
    "a key step in this approach is to approximate a function @xmath17 defined in the interval @xmath18 $ ] by an n - th order polynomial @xmath19 _ exactly _ at the discrete collocation points @xmath20 , @xmath21 within the legendre pseudospectral method that we are using currently , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath20 s @xmath24 are determined from the roots of first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath25 with respect to @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28s in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are termed the cardinal functions expressed as , @xmath29 satisfying the relation @xmath30 . at this stage",
    ", a transformation @xmath31 is used to map the semi - infinite domain @xmath32 $ ] onto the finite domain @xmath18 $ ] , along with an algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath33 , with l , @xmath34 being two mapping parameters . finally introducing a symmetrization procedure",
    "gives a transformed hamiltonian of the following form , @xmath35 the advantage lies in the fact that this leads to a _ symmetric _ matrix eigenvalue problem which can be solved readily and efficiently to give accurate eigenvalues , eigenfunctions by using standard routines .",
    "note that @xmath36 for the above transformation and one finally obtains a set of discretized coupled equations .",
    "considerable checks have been made on the convergence of eigenvalues with respect to the mapping parameters for a decent number of molecular states .",
    "after a series of such test calculations , a choice has been made at the point where the results changed negligibly with such variations . in this way , a consistent and uniform set of parameters ( @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) has been used .",
    ".[tab : table1]spectroscopic parameters of the molecules , used in present calculation , taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next we proceed for a detailed investigation on the energy variations for three selected molecules _ viz . , _",

    "the top three panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) in fig .",
    "1 depict the variations of e@xmath40d@xmath41 ( in ev ) with respect to the angular quantum number @xmath16 for h@xmath1 , hf and no .",
    "these are given for six values of vibrational quantum number , _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath42 for h@xmath1 ; seven values of @xmath15 ( @xmath43 in addition to all the six @xmath15 in h@xmath1 ) for hf ; and nine values of @xmath15 ( @xmath44 in addition to all the seven @xmath15 in hf ) for no .",
    "note that the @xmath16 axis goes to 30 for h@xmath1 , while for the other two this is extended to 40 .",
    "this happens because of the fact that a limited number of bound states is supported by the potential .",
    "such bound states occur in larger number for no and hf than in h@xmath1",
    ". it may be worthwhile mentioning here that , the maximum vibrational quantum number @xmath45 and maximum rotational quantum number @xmath46 for h@xmath1 , hf , n@xmath1 , no , o@xmath1 , o@xmath2 are ( 22,39 ) , ( 28,66 ) , ( 66,260 ) , ( 56,230 ) , ( 52,220 ) and ( 56,235 ) respectively @xcite .",
    "the above @xmath45 s are to be contrasted with the corresponding values of 18 , 23 , 82 , 67 , 65 and 58 in morse potential for the six molecules under investigation @xcite .",
    "much larger differences in @xmath45 in th potential ( 96 ) and morse potential ( 174 ) have been observed in i@xmath1 , where the actual value is 107 @xcite .",
    "the plots for other three molecules are omitted , as their qualitative characteristic features remain similar to one of the three plots in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) .",
    "as one moves along the h@xmath1-hf - no series , the plot for a given @xmath15 series tends to vary rather slowly ( rate of increase slows down ) , with h@xmath1 and no showing maximum and minimum increase respectively , such that for no the plots are quite flat . also for a given molecule , as one goes to higher @xmath15 values , the separation between two successive @xmath15 plots tends to decrease .",
    "similar qualitative feature has been recorded earlier in the energy versus @xmath16 plot for h@xmath1 within a semiclassical approach @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the e@xmath40d@xmath41 ( in ev ) versus @xmath15 for fixed @xmath16 quantum number for the same three molecules in the bottom panels ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath15 axis in h@xmath1 , hf , no extends to 25 , 30 and 40 . for h@xmath1 ,",
    "these are studied at seven @xmath16 , _ viz . , _ 0,5,10,15,20,25,30 , while for the other two molecules two more @xmath16 values of 35 , 40 are considered besides the seven value of h@xmath1 . in going from h@xmath1-hf - no ,",
    "the plots for different @xmath16 become progressively more closely spaced , with h@xmath1 showing maximum sparsity and in no the successive separations are too small to be identified properly in the scale .",
    "another interesting feature is that , rate of increase in energy slowly increases as one moves the series , producing a nearly linear structure in no . also for h@xmath1 ,",
