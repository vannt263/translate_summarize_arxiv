    "the authors studied equilibrium properties of the classical heisenberg model on triangular lattice with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath0 and third - nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath1 .",
    "they found that a first - order phase transition with threefold symmetry breaking occurs at finite temperature .",
    "this looks a strange phase transition , since phase transition with threefold symmetry breaking is often second - order phase transition on two - dimensional lattice _",

    "such a first - order phase transition sometimes takes place in two - dimensional frustrated systems with a number of competed interactions .",
    "it is an open problem why such a first - order phase transision appears in some two - dimensional frustrated systems .    to consider this problem",
    ", we constructed a model which exhibits a first - order phase transition with threefold symmetry breaking by introducing new kind of parameter into the standard ferromagnetic three - state potts model@xcite .",
    "we introduced the invisible states which does not contribute to the internal energy .",
    "the ground state of the potts model with invisible state and its degeneracy are the same as that of the standard potts model .",
    "we found that the first - order phase transition with threefold symmetry breaking occurs by just adding the invisible states into the standard three - state ferromagnetic potts model .",
    "the standard potts model is regarded as a fundamental model to consider the properties of phase transition in statistical physics@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the potts model with invisible states is a potential model which can clarify inherent nature of first - order phase transition with breaking of threefold symmetry on two - dimensional lattice .",
    "our aim of the present study is to clarify dynamic properties of potts model with invisible states .",
    "it is interesting topic in statistical physics to study dynamical nature of the systems which exhibit a first - order phase transition , since there are some similar points between these systems and glassy systems@xcite .",
    "it is expected that some dynamic nature in glassy systems can be explained in terms of dynamic behavior of the systems which have a first - order phase transition .",
    "potts model with invisible states can be considered a potential model to study dynamical nature of first - order phase transition .",
    "this is because we can control the energy barrier between the ordered state and paramagnetic state without changing the symmetry which breaks at the transition temperature by modulating the number of invisible states .",
