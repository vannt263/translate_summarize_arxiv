    "mutual agreement , or consensus , is a fundamental phenomenon in social and natural systems .",
    "the dynamics of opinion sharing and competing and the emergence of consensus have become an active topic of recent research in statistical and nonlinear physics @xcite .",
    "for example , a number of models have been proposed to address how consensus can result from the evolution of two competing opinions in a population , which include the voter model @xcite , the majority rule model @xcite , the bounded - confidence model @xcite and the social impact model @xcite . due to the high relevance of complex networks @xcite to social and natural systems",
    ", opinion dynamics have also been incorporated on networks @xcite such as regular lattices , random graphs @xcite , small - world networks @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "previous works have revealed phase transitions in opinion dynamics @xcite and the emergence of global consensus @xcite where all agents share the same opinion .",
    "it has also been found that both the network structures @xcite and the opinion updating strategies @xcite can affect the time for reaching the final consensus . in ref .",
    "@xcite , yang @xmath2 @xmath3 combined the majority rule model with probability @xmath4 with the voter model with probability @xmath5 and then measure the resulting consensus times on scale - free networks .",
    "they found that that the optimized ratio to minimize consensus time is around @xmath6 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , yang @xmath2 @xmath3 studied the effects of heterogeneous influence of individuals on the global consensus .",
    "each individual is assigned a weight that is proportional to the power of its degree , where the power exponent @xmath1 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "interestingly , it is found that there exists an optimal value of @xmath1 leading to the shortest consensus time for scale - free networks , random networks and small - world networks .    in the voter model ,",
    "an agents follows the opinion of a randomly selected neighboring agent . in the majority rule model",
    ", an agent follows the local majority opinion . for the voter model and the majority rule model , an",
    "agents absolutely follows one opinion .",
    "however , in reality , there can be situations where an agent chooses one opinion with a stochastic probability due to bounded rationality . in this letter",
    ", we propose a nonlinear voter model in which an agent @xmath0 selects one of binary opinions with the probability that is proportional to the power of the number of agents carrying this opinion among agent @xmath0 and its nearest neighbors .",
    "the power exponent @xmath1 is introduced to control selective probability .",
    "our main finding is that , there exists an optimal value of @xmath1 for which the convergent time for consensus is minimum .",
    "this phenomenon indicates that , a suitable preference of the local majority opinion ( not following it absolutely ) can greatly accelerate the convergence process towards the final consensus .",
    "our model is described as follows . for a given network of any topology",
    ", each node represents an agent . initially the two opinions denoted by the values @xmath7 are randomly assigned to agents with equal probability . at each time step",
    ", agents synchronously update @xcite their opinions according to the following rule .",
    "agent @xmath0 will select the opinion @xmath8 with the probability @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number of agents holding the opinion @xmath8 and @xmath12 among agent @xmath0 and its nearest neighbors respectively , and @xmath1 is an adjustable parameter . similarly ,",
    "agent @xmath0 selects the opinion @xmath12 with the probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 characterizes the degree of herd effect on consensus . for @xmath15 , agent",
    "@xmath0 has a larger probability to select the local majority ( minority ) opinion . in the case of @xmath16 ,",
    "agent @xmath0 randomly selects the opinion @xmath8 or @xmath12 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "our model coincides with the voter model . for @xmath18 ,",
    "agent @xmath0 absolutely takes the local majority opinion and our model is reduced to the model proposed in ref . @xcite",
    "we first consider a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define an order parameter @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the value of node @xmath0 s opinion ( @xmath8 or @xmath12 ) and @xmath22 is the total number of nodes of the network . in general , we have @xmath23 , and a large value of @xmath19 indicates that one opinion in the system dominates the other . if the two opinions are equally probably , we have @xmath24 . when global consensus is achieved so that there is only one opinion in the system , we have @xmath25 .    figure  [ order ] shows the order parameter @xmath19 as a function of the time step @xmath26 for different values of @xmath1 . for @xmath1=1 , 1.1 and 2 , @xmath19 increases from 0 to 1 with @xmath26 . for @xmath27 ,",

    "we see that eventually @xmath54 decreases to 1 and @xmath39 increases to 1 for large @xmath26 . for small values of @xmath1",
    ", agents do not select the local majority opinion with large probability , thus it becomes difficult for them to form large opinion clusters . for with @xmath28 , at the beginning , @xmath54 decreases and @xmath39 increases much more slowly . for @xmath27 , initially @xmath54 decreases and @xmath39 increases more quickly than the cases of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , when there are only two or three opinion clusters remained in the system , @xmath54 decreases and @xmath39 increases very slowly for @xmath27 , indicating that the merging of different clusters becomes difficult for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath18 , the system can not reach consensus in some cases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ map ] , two different opinions can coexist forever when @xmath18 . for moderate values of @xmath1 ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "large opinion clusters can be formed more rapidly than for low values of @xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) , and the their emergence is facilitated than the cases of larger values of @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xmath27 ) as well .",
    "thus the convergence time becomes minimum for some moderate value of @xmath1 .",
    "it can also be noted that the evolution of @xmath39 for different values of @xmath1 is similar to that of @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ order ] ) .    to assess how different values of @xmath1 affect the evolution of the opinion clusters , we design a numerical procedure to investigate the evolution of spatial patterns of opinion .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath31 square lattice , initially we set a subregion of @xmath41 at the center where all agents have the opinion @xmath8 , but the other nodes carry the opinion @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",
    "we see that for @xmath57 , e.g. , @xmath58 , the boundary between the two opinion clusters gradually become blurred and they tend to be well - mixed with approximately equal densities . in this case ,",
    "global consensus is less likely due to the difficulty to form opinion clusters . for moderate values of @xmath1 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath59 , the boundaries become irregular with time but finally the @xmath8 cluster vanishes . for high values of @xmath1 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath60 , the boundaries are clear and the inside cluster shrinks but at a speed lower than that for @xmath29 .    [ 0.4 ] as a function of @xmath1 for er random graphs , nw small - world networks and ba scale - free networks .",
    "the average connectivities of er , nw and ba networks are 4 .",
    "the inset shows the value of @xmath32 as a function of the average connectivity @xmath61 for the three types of networks .",
    "the network size is @xmath62 .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 100 different network realizations with 20 runs for each realization.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the existence of an optimal value of @xmath1 for which global consensus can be achieved rapidly is not restricted to the square - lattice structure .",
    "in fact , we have observed a similar behavior for complex networks including erds - rnyi random graphs ( er ) @xcite , newman - watts small - world networks ( nw ) @xcite and barabsi - albert scale - free networks ( ba ) @xcite .",
    "we also observe that , the optimal value of @xmath1 tends to increase with the average connectivity @xmath61 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ network ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ network ] , one can see that the topological structure affects the convergent time @xmath38 .",
    "among the three complex networks , @xmath38 for scale - free networks is shortest when @xmath61 and @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a nonlinear voter model to study the convergence to global consensus on lattices and complex networks .",
    "an agent @xmath0 selects one of binary opinions with the probability that is proportional to the power of the number of agents carrying this opinion among agent @xmath0 and its nearest neighbors .",
    "the power exponent @xmath1 is introduced to govern selective probability .",
    "it is found that there exists an optimal value of @xmath1 leading to the shortest convergent time .",
    "we have explained such phenomenon in terms of the evolution of the opinion clusters . for too small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the formation of big opinion clusters is slow .",
    "for very high values of @xmath1 , the merging of different opinion clusters becomes difficult .",
    "taken together , the shortest convergent time can be realized at moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "our results indicate that , the consensus would be quickly reached if agents suitably follow the local majority opinion .",
