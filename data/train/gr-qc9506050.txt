    "recently , damour and nordtvedt @xcite have pointed out that during a dust dominated cosmological era , scalar - tensor theories of gravity tend to approach general relativity at late times even in the absence of a potential for the brans - dicke field .",
    "this can be parametrized by the brans - dicke parameter @xmath0 , which determines the ratio of the scalar to tensor couplings to matter , and tends to infinity in the general relativistic limit .",
    "damour and nordtvedt realized that this would occur during most of the history of the universe , when the trace of the energy - momentum tensor drives the scalar field .",

    "thus , apart from setting the scene for the conventional hot big bang , by producing a spatially flat , isotropic , homogeneous ( but slightly perturbed ) metric , it is tempting to suggest that inflation may also produce general relativity as the low - energy effective theory of gravity , even if it started as a generic scalar - tensor theory at the planck scale  @xcite .",

    "it is possible that both slow - roll parameters become large at the same point , but this seems to be unlikely a priori .",
    "the perturbation at the end of inflation can then be equated with that at re - entry if its subsequent evolution remains adiabatic .",
    "any variation of the brans - dicke field after the end of inflation could invalidate this assumption .",

    "however this could be altered by the presence of an explicit potential term and the consequences would require careful investigation .      for large values of @xmath55 we can neglect the potential terms in the perturbed field equations  ( [ psig ] ) and  ( [ ppsi ] ) and they reduce to those for massless fields ( i.e. , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",

    "the larger effective gravitational constant at early times ( @xmath112 ) amplifies the tilt due to the changing shape of the inflaton potential , and its variation leads to an additional negative tilt .",
    "any chance of constraining @xmath113 from observations of the tilt is clearly limited by uncertainty in the form of the inflaton potential . in the simplest case of chaotic inflation driven by a polynomial potential , @xmath114",

    "it is interesting to note that the naive calculation based on taking @xmath117 does in fact give the correct result and , even in our careful analysis , @xmath49 remains constant on super - hubble scales .",
    "this is clearly seen in the fig .  1 , where we show the evolution of @xmath49 after hubble crossing in the specific model of chaotic inflation discussed in the next section .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that at hubble crossing the curvature perturbation is due to the @xmath16 field , @xmath118 , while by the end of inflation it appears as a perturbation in the @xmath29 field , @xmath119 .",

    "the slow - roll solution for @xmath29 , satisfying @xmath128 , is ^2 ^ 2 8 + ( a_1 ^ 2/ a_2)a_2  , where @xmath129 is the exponential integral function @xcite",
    ".    it will be convenient to define some new variables [ new ] x =  , y = ( -2a ( ) )  , whose classical evolution in the slow - roll approximation is shown in fig .  2 for @xmath130 and @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "note that in both cases @xmath133 , and thus the planck mass , becomes essentially constant by the end of inflation .",

    "this reflects the need to keep the planck mass essentially constant to avoid large departures from the harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath103 ) spectrum .",
    "figure  7 shows similar results for the contribution of gravitational wave perturbations at the same scale , @xmath148 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the constraints that may be placed upon the effective theory of gravity during a period of inflation in the early universe .",
    "we do this in the context of scalar - tensor theories , taking the coupling of the brans - dicke field to matter as an arbitrary function @xmath21 , and neglecting any explicit potential for the dilaton field .",
    "present day observational limits on the variation of the brans - dicke field are expressed as bounds on the post - newtonian parameters of the theory .",
    "we have shown that the general relativistic limit of these parameters coincides with the vanishing of the corresponding slow - roll parameters for the brans - dicke field during inflation .",
    "slow - roll inflation already requires the scalar - tensor theory to be close to the general relativistic limit .",
    "the observed spectrum of density perturbations produced from quantum fluctuations in the inflaton and brans - dicke fields can then constrain just how large the deviation may be .    a careful calculation of the curvature perturbation @xmath49 during inflation",
    "shows that some of the results , applicable to single - field inflation in general relativity , no longer apply . due to the evolution of the two fields during inflation",
    ", there will be non - adiabatic perturbations , which can lead to the evolution of @xmath49 on scales larger than the hubble length .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of @xmath49 at re - entry can no longer be equated with that at the time the scale left the horizon .",
    "this is a general feature of inflation with two fields .",
    "however , in scalar - tensor theories there are regimes for which @xmath49 does remain constant outside the hubble scale . in models where inflation ends as the inflaton field rolls to the minimum of its potential , we find two regimes for which @xmath49 at the end of inflation is equal to that at hubble - crossing .",
    "it is only in an intermediate regime that the naive calculation breaks down .",
    "we give expressions for the spectral slopes , @xmath75 and @xmath89 , and relative amplitude , @xmath74 , of the scalar and tensor perturbations produced , in terms of the slow - roll parameters of a general scalar - tensor theory of gravity .",
    "observational bounds then place constraints on these parameters .",
    "a possible signature of scalar - tensor inflation is the breakdown of the consistency relations predicted in single - field inflation  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our ability to make quantitative predictions relies on our knowledge of the inflaton potential . in our specific example of a chaotic inflation model",
    ", we find that if we constrain the slope of the spectrum to be @xmath149 we obtain bounds on @xmath23 and @xmath106 at the end of inflation that are comparable with those from nucleosynthesis or solar - system tests .",
    "for example , for @xmath150 we require @xmath151 , which is much stronger than the corresponding post - newtonian bound .",
    "future observations will be able to constrain @xmath75 to within @xmath84  @xcite which would further improve the bounds on ( @xmath23,@xmath106 ) , in the context of a given inflaton potential .",
    "although far harder to measure , the tilt of the tensor perturbations , @xmath89 , gives a model - independent bound on @xmath23 .",
