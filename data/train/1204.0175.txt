    "in the last decades , an increasing interest has arisen towards analytic tools able to create singular bundles for interesting energies , starting with donaldson s breakthrough linking @xmath2-dimensional topology to the study of @xmath3-bundles which are critical points of the @xmath4-norm of the curvature studied by uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "this study is especially interesting in the case of supercritical dimensions , where it gave rise to new questions , among which is the one regarding the possibility of constructing new nontrivial bundles satisfying the yang - mills equations by minimizing the natural energy under some topological constraint ; see @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . for nonabelian bundles in supercritical dimensions ,",
    "a setting in which the direct method of the calculus of variations can be applied to obtain critical bundles with singularities is not yet well established ( see however the definitions in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "together with tristan rivire , we started @xcite an approach which should give the _ suitable setting for posing a minimization problem for weak bundles in supercritical dimensions _",
    ", in the abelian case of complex @xmath5-line bundles . since the yang - mills energy in the nonabelian case is the @xmath4-norm of the curvature , we considered the energies defined by @xmath0-norms also in the abelian case . under such constraint",
    "a suitable setting should consist of the following ingredients :    * _ a class of weak bundles which is closed by sequential weak-@xmath0 convergence of the curvatures : _ since as we said the natural energy is the @xmath0-norm of the curvature , the topology giving precompactness of sublevelsets is the weak @xmath0-topology . in particular any minimizing sequence will have a weakly convergent subsequence , and a suitable class of bundles should be closed under this topology .",
    "* _ a suitable notion of boundary value : _ if @xmath6 is the curvature of our bundle , we want to be able to state the minimization problem which could be formally written as follows @xmath7 in a meaningful way . in particular , we would like the weak convergence in the previous point not to disrupt our boundary condition , and to reduce to the usual boundary restriction for locally smooth bundles .    as we briefly describe in sections",
    "[ closureintro ] and [ closuresec ] , the first point above was solved by the main theorem of @xcite .",
    "the solution of the second point is one of the main results of the present work ( see section [ defbdry ] )    another possible approach for the creation of nontrivial bundles which are critical for our energy is by minimizing a _ relaxed energy _ instead ,",
    "as suggested in @xcite and @xcite , and in analogy with the case of harmonic maps @xcite . in our case",
    "a good candidate for such energy would for example be given by @xmath8      consider the aim of making a minimization problem as in rigorous for supercritical @xmath5-bundles .",
    "the natural topological invariant of @xmath5-bundles is the first chern class , @xmath9 , which , for an @xmath5-bundle @xmath10 over a compact surface @xmath11 is expressible via chern - weil theory as @xmath12 where @xmath6 is a curvature on @xmath10 ( see@xcite ) . by identifying the lie algebra @xmath13 with @xmath14",
    ", we can identify @xmath6 with a @xmath14-valued @xmath15-form on @xmath11 .",
    "then , in the `` supercritical '' dimension @xmath1 , a @xmath15-form can be interpreted as a curvature if it gives integer volume to almost every closed surface ( that integer corresponds to the @xmath9 of a line bundle restricted to the surface ) . in @xcite",
    "the following class was first defined :    [ defnfzabel ] we call an @xmath0-integrable @xmath15-form @xmath6 defined on a @xmath1-dimensional domain @xmath16 a * curvature of a weak line bundle with group @xmath5 * , if for all @xmath17 and for almost all @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , there holds @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inclusion map .",
    "we call @xmath22 the class of such @xmath6 .",
    "[ vfif ] we could associate to a @xmath15-form @xmath6 the vectorfield @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 so that @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the outer normal to @xmath16 and @xmath27 being the oriented unit volume @xmath15-form on @xmath28 . via this correspondence",
    ", we can identify curvatures of @xmath0 weak @xmath5-bundles as in definition [ defnfzabel ] with _ @xmath0-vectorfields having integer fluxes _ through almost all spheres .    note that in definition [ defnfzabel ] no assumption is made a priori , regarding the existence of an underlying topological bundle structure , and we only concentrate on the datum present in our target minimization problem , namely the curvature form @xmath6 , while the presence of an underlying bundle is witnessed just by the chern class requirement .",
    "this is the natural setting where to construct new bundles by minimizing the energy , because the supercritical case is precisely characterized by the possibility of creation of topological singularities , and imposing an initial smooth structure precludes this possibility .",
    "the sets along which we slice , in definition [ defnfzabel ] , are just spheres . by the density result of @xcite however , it follows from such definition that automatically such integrality condition is valid on all codimension @xmath29 closed generic surfaces . in a similar way ,",
    "the same result for generic surfaces can be achieved starting from a definition which involves slicing sets different from spheres , e.g. cubes , or some other family of sets becoming arbitrarily fine at each point , and allowing a similar density result .",
    "the above definition [ defnfzabel ] gives a description of bundles in terms of their slices on spheres , and therefore a suggestive parallel can be made with the theory of _ scans _ present in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "a first fruit of this parallel is the idea leading to the proof of the closure theorem in @xcite :    [ closureweakbdl ] suppose @xmath30 as in definition [ defnfzabel ] are weakly convergent to some @xmath15-form @xmath6 . then @xmath31 .",
    "the main achievement of the present paper is the definition of the boundary trace in section [ defbdry ] . on one hand such definition",
    "gives a nontrivial trace , while on the other hand it is preserved under weak convergence .",
    "this is due to the intervention of the slice distance directly in its definition , together with the properties described in section [ regandconv ] .",
    "an interesting consequence of that definition is the following result on the existence of minimizers for the problem :    [ minimexist ] consider @xmath32 . fix an @xmath0-integrable @xmath15-form @xmath33 on @xmath34 having integer degree .",
    "then the infimum in problem with is achieved , if we interpret the boundary condition @xmath35 as @xmath36 , with notations as in section [ defbdry ] .",
    "fix a minimizing sequence @xmath37 in the class @xmath38 .",
    "up to extracting a subsequence we may suppose that @xmath39 , which by weak semicontinuity of the @xmath0-norm has energy at most equal to the infimum in problem .",
    "theorem [ closureweakbdl ] gives then the fact that @xmath40 , while lemma [ boundarys ] of section [ defbdry ] gives @xmath36 as wanted .",
    "the same result and proof hold in the case of domains @xmath41 such that @xmath16 is just bilipschitz equivalent to a smooth domain @xmath42 . in that case",
    "we will have to first define the distance analogous to our @xmath43 on slices along the sets @xmath44 which foliate in the usual way a tubular neighborhood of @xmath45 , then using that distance define the boundary trace exactly as in section [ defbdry ] .",
    "the proof of hlder dependence on the parameter @xmath46 proceeds as in section [ regandconv ] , and this is enough to prove the results in section [ defbdry ] . proceeding as in section [ lipslices ] we",
    "can then obtain the same result for @xmath16 , simply by using the bilipschitz equivalence .",
    "the fact that minimizers in have finitely many singularities in any compact @xmath47 is proved in @xcite .",
    "the boundary regularity ( and thus the fact that singularities of minimizers are isolated ) will be addressed in @xcite .",
    "we now build an analogy between @xcite ( see also the more recent development @xcite ) , @xcite and the case treated here .",
    "consult @xcite for the notations of the next paragraph .",
    "+ recall that in @xcite normal currents @xmath48 on a metric space @xmath49 were identified by the property that their slices by lipschitz functions @xmath50 , having values in the space @xmath51 of @xmath52-dimensional currents @xmath53 were metric bounded variation ( mbv ) functions , where @xmath51 is endowed with the flat metric @xmath54 for mbv slice functions it was then proved that the union of the atoms of the slices constituted a _",
    "rectifiable _ set .",
    "such construction of a rectifiable set tailored on a normal current was the main step for the later closure theorems .",
    "the proof of the rectifiability was based on the following estimate valid for @xmath55 functions @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a weakly separable metric space : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a @xmath60-function related to @xmath61 ( see @xcite , p.42 for a precise definition ) . + in our case , we slice along spheres , as in definition [ defnfzabel ] .",
    "consider a form @xmath31 , and a ball @xmath62 .",
    "then if @xmath63 is the identification by dilation and translation , we can define the slice function as @xmath640,r[\\to \\mathcal y , \\quad \\rho\\mapsto i_{x,\\rho}^*f,\\ ] ] and the natural choice for the space @xmath65 is indicated again by definition [ defnfzabel ] : @xmath66    we could also define the slice function on the space of all balls @xmath67 by defining @xmath68 .",
    "this function takes almost everywhere values on @xmath65 .",
    "the choice of the suitable distance on @xmath65 is actually justified by the need of a property like .",
    "the picture justifying the definition of the distance depends on the density result of @xcite ( see @xcite , section 6 ) , and is based on the following result :    [ densitykessel ] suppose that @xmath31",
    ". then there exists a @xmath29-dimensional rectifiable current @xmath69 such that @xmath70 for a constant @xmath71 independent of @xmath6 and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "the situation between two slices centered at @xmath74 is shown in figure [ fig : slices ] .",
    "therefore we would expect that the property that @xmath75 coincides with @xmath76 in the weak sense be preserved by some projection along the radial segments connecting the slices .",
    "given this picture and this idea , the definition of the following analogous of the flat distance is justified :    let @xmath77 .",
    "we define then the following function @xmath78 where the infimum is taken over all triples given by a @xmath0-integrable @xmath29-form @xmath79 , an integer @xmath29-current @xmath69 of finite mass , and an @xmath80-ple of couples @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    in @xcite",
    "it was proved that @xmath43 as above defines a distance , and satisfies an inequality like , where @xmath59 is replaced by a @xmath84-function depending on @xmath6 and on the ratio of the two radii defining the slices . the closure theorem [ closureweakbdl ]",
    "was proved using the interplay between this metric and the function @xmath85      in the next section we discuss some definitions of metrics on slices , relying mainly on the density result @xcite . in section [ regandconv ]",
    "we prove that the slice function @xmath86 is actually hlder with respect to the above distance , and that it metrizes the weak sequential convergence on slices of bounded norm .",
    "a parallel is drawn with the classical case of slices of @xmath87-vectorfields . in section [ lipslices ]",
    "we show how to extend the distance to different kinds of slices , where the space @xmath88 in the definition of @xmath65 is replaced by a lipschitz domain .",
    "this result is used to give a suitable definition of the boundary trace for curvatures belonging to @xmath22 in section [ defbdry ] . then , in the final section , we state several open questions and indicate some further directions of research .",
    "i wish to thank my advisor prof .",
    "tristan rivire for introducing me to the topics of this paper and for the many enlightening discussions we had on the topics of this paper .",
    "i would also like to thank prof .",
    "bernd kirchheim for pointing out the proof of lemma [ kirchlemma ] .",
    "we will compare here the distance on @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 as in the introduction , to the following function : @xmath91 we define also the following function , in the struggle to free our distance @xmath43 from the presence of an unknown sum of dirac masses : @xmath92\\subset a , \\:a\\text { open } , |a|\\leq \\epsilon\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    the motivations for introducing these objects are as follows :    1 .",
    "sometimes in applications , as for example in section [ lipslices ] , it is easier to deal with definitions in terms of finite , rather than infinite , sets of `` topological '' singularities .",
    "this justifies the introduction of @xmath93 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether or not our distance @xmath43 is induced by a norm on @xmath94 .",
    "candidates for such norms would then be norms which `` do nt see small sets '' , in particular they should not be sensible to the presence of the singular measures defining @xmath43 . more importantly , having an underlying norm could perhaps help to define new and more natural notions of critical points for our energy . investigating",
    "the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath95 seems a reasonable first step in that direction of research .",

    "the slice @xmath514 exists and gives an integer when tested with the constant @xmath29 for all @xmath74 and all but at most countably many @xmath227 . * for no @xmath31 with @xmath96 is the current @xmath69 given by proposition [ densitykessel ] equal to @xmath513 .",
    "we may suppose up to rescaling that @xmath515 where @xmath516 is a square of sidelenght @xmath15 ( this is more than needed for the rest of the proof , but makes the notations easier ) .",
    "consider a sequence of positive numbers @xmath517 such that @xmath518 , then align a sequence of disjoint balls @xmath495 such that @xmath519 , along one of the axes of @xmath516 .",
    "inside each @xmath495 two disjoint spheres @xmath520 of diameter @xmath517 can be packed ; then identify the oriented segment joining their centers with an integer @xmath29-current , and define @xmath69 as the sum of all these currents .",
    "the @xmath69 has mass @xmath29 , but ( by applying jensen s inequality on smaller spheres concentric to the @xmath520 ) it is evident that @xmath6 as in the statement of the lemma must have @xmath521 .",
