    "the landau  zener ( lz ) problem @xcite has been the subject of intense study for over four score years .",
    "it has become a paradigm time - dependent two - level dynamical model that has been applied in many areas of quantum physics .",
    "here we shall focus on two extensions of this classic problem .",
    "let us first briefly remind the reader of the original lz problem , since it serves as a starting point for the extensions .",
    "the lz problem involves the evolution of the wave function of a coupled two - level system whose time - dependent energies , when uncoupled , cross at some time , say @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lz_wo_decay ] ) .",
    "the relevant physical quantity is the lz probability , i.e. , the modulus squared of one of the components of the wave function , as time @xmath10 , and it is of interest to determine its dependence on the coupling strength and on the rate of energy change with time .    in the original version of the problem @xcite",
    ", the energy levels depend linearly on time .",
    "two widely used forms , displayed in figs .",

    "[ fig_lz_wo_decay](b ) plots the diagonal elements and the instantaneous eigenvalues @xmath17 of @xmath16 versus time . as will be argued below , in the presence of level decay , it is useful to consider other models where , unlike the linear time - dependent levels , the dependence of the unperturbed levels @xmath18 on time are such that @xmath18 is bounded at all times .",
    "one such model is @xmath19 where @xmath20 controls the rate of energy change near @xmath21 .",
    "the lz problem can be stated as follows : what is the survival probability @xmath22 of finding the system in state @xmath23 as @xmath24 , if it starts off in the state @xmath23 as @xmath25 [ see fig .  [ fig_lz_wo_decay](b ) , where states @xmath23 and @xmath26 are the _ diabatic _",

    "adiabatic _ states ] . as @xmath29",
    ", the adiabatic theorem ensures that the system stays in the initial adiabatic state @xmath27 .",
    "the original lz problem can be formulated as follows : let @xmath30 and analyze its dependence on @xmath14 and @xmath31 .",
    "in this paper we consider two extensions of the original problem which are of physical interest .",
    "first , we focus on the case where one or both of the energy levels decay .",
    "the motivation for studying the effects of level decay on the lz probability is that decay occurs in many physical processes , including light - induced transitions between metastable states @xcite , collision - induced losses of laser - cooled atoms in magneto - optical traps @xcite , photoassociative ionization collisions in a magneto - optical traps @xcite , and adiabatic fast passage in nuclear magnetic resonance population inversion processes in the presence of radio - frequency magnetic fields    @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "level decay can be modeled by letting the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian acquire a time - independent negative imaginary part , @xmath32 = - \\gamma_i/2 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the decay rate of level @xmath34 . for example , consider the case where @xmath15 , eq .",

    "transitions between decaying states were analyzed both using a master equation approach and by adding a decay term to the hamiltonian in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",

    "we show below that this result is due to the divergence of @xmath46 as @xmath47 , i.e. , it is in some sense an artifact .",
    "one of our main goals is then to study models for the lz problem with decay where @xmath48 is bounded as @xmath47 , and show that in this case , @xmath49 does depend on @xmath45 .",

    "the second extension considered here concerns the case where the lz transition is affected by dephasing .",
    "dephasing of a quantum system occurs due to interaction between the system and its environment .",
    "examples include collisions of a particle with other particles , and interactions with environmental degrees of freedom such as an electromagnetic field that is random or stochastic . in the case of dephasing due to collisions with particles ,",
    "each collision can have a random duration and a random strength ; in the case of interactions with an environment , the many degrees of freedom of the environment ( the `` bath '' ) can randomly affect the phase of the wave function .",
    "this results in a time - dependent uncertainty @xmath50 in the phase of the wave function . at a time @xmath51 for which @xmath52 , interference is completely lost .",
    "incorporation of dephasing in lz transitions has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "dephasing processes occur in metals @xcite . moreover , dephasing is important in atomic clock transitions @xcite , in quantum information processes @xcite and in nuclear - spin - dependent ground - state dephasing of diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers @xcite .",
    "we treat such transitions using a schrdinger - langevin stochastic differential equation formalism @xcite , and solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation with a gaussian white - noise stochastic term , and with ornstein  uhlenbeck noise .",
    "this enables us to study not only the averaged survival probability but also its distribution and its dependence on the strength of coupling between the system and the environment .",
    "as we shall see , the distribution in the strong coupling regime ( short dephasing time ) is very different from that in the weak coupling regime , both for white - noise and for ornstein  uhlenbeck noise .",

    "berry s approach with a superadiabatic basis @xcite is used to obtain the survival probability @xmath22 in the slow - sweep limit ( small @xmath14 ) .",
    "the main result obtained was that @xmath22 is composed of two factors , a geometrical and dynamical one , and these factors are analyzed . when applied to the model of ref .",

    "critical damping of stckelberg oscillations is predicted and analyzed in the region of very small probability , @xmath373 .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , deals with specific forms of the time dependence of the energy levels and leads to analytic solutions of the pertinent second order differential equations .",
    "this enabled us to carry out a systematic analysis of the dependence of @xmath22 on decay parameters for arbitrary values of decay rate and channel coupling . the independence of @xmath22 on the decay rate for the linear case is simply explained in terms of the analytic solution , as is the dependence of @xmath22 on the decay rate for the saturated energy case .",

    "zener problem with dephasing . for",
    "an example of such dephasing processes , consider the population transfer within the triplet ground state manifold of diamond nv@xmath374 centers @xcite . in diamond nv centers , the @xmath375 level is lower in energy than the @xmath376 levels due to crystal field effects .",
    "suppose one is interested in moving population from @xmath375 to @xmath377 by slowly sweeping ( chirping through resonance ) the frequency of a radio - frequency field that is nearly in resonance with the @xmath378 transition .",
    "the @xmath377 state decays to @xmath375 ( longitudinal and transverse decay processes can both take place ) , and therefore the decay is _ within _ the three - level manifold .",

    "zener dynamics with both white - noise and ornstein  uhlenbeck - noise ( a similar procedure can be used to model @xmath274 processes if the coupling operator is taken to be @xmath379 rather than @xmath380 ) . for gaussian white noise",
    ", his method is equivalent to using a density matrix approach with lindblad operators @xcite , but produces non - markovian dynamics for other kinds of noise .",
    "references  @xcite and @xcite showed that for landau  zener transitions with dephasing driven by white noise , the underlying physics depends on whether the dephasing time is long ( weak dephasing ) or short ( weak dephasing ) . the schrdinger ",
    "langevin equation approach enabled us to compute the survival probability both in the weak and strong dephasing regimes .",
    "we calculated the distribution of the survival probability and pointed out its distinct behaviour in the long and short dephasing time regimes , and we showed that ornstein  uhlenbeck noise gives somewhat different behavior than gaussian white noise .",
    "we also analyzed the combined effects of one - level decay and dephasing on the averaged lz survival probability .",
    "we found that the counterintuitive result , that there are situations where the lz probability _ increases _ with decay rate , survives also in the presence of dephasing .",
