    "the chorus experiment was designed to search for @xmath3  @xmath4 @xmath0  oscillations through the observation of charged - current interactions @xmath0  @xmath5 followed by the decay of the @xmath6 lepton , directly observed in a nuclear emulsion target . the experiment aimed at achieving maximum sensitivity on the effective mixing angle for values of the mass parameter @xmath2 larger than @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "this particular choice was based on the hypothesis that the neutrino mass could contribute to the solution of the dark matter puzzle @xcite . a short - baseline experiment in the cern sps wide band neutrino beam @xcite",
    "was well suited for this search .",
    "another experiment , nomad , used the same beam and searched for @xmath0 appearance using a purely electronic technique @xcite .",
    "the chorus experiment took data from 1994 to 1997 .",
    "a first phase of data analysis ( ` phase i ' ) was performed and no evidence for oscillations was found @xcite . owing to several improvements in automated emulsion scanning and in the event recontruction ,",
    "it was considered worthwhile to perform a new and more complete analysis ( ` phase ii ' ) of the data collected in the 19961997 period .    in this paper",
    ", we report the analysis performed on the events for which no muons were observed in the electronic detector ( _ @xmath9 events _ ) . in particular , a dedicated search for decays into three charged hadrons was also performed . combining this new sample with the data samples analysed and published in previous papers , _ i.e. _ with",
    "a muon observed in the electronic detector ( @xmath10 ) for the whole period of data taking and a small @xmath9 sample collected in 19941995 , leads to an improvement of the chorus sensitivity to @xmath3  @xmath4 @xmath0  appearance by a factor 1.5 and to @xmath11  @xmath4 @xmath0  appearance by a factor 1.2 .",
    "although it is now established that @xmath3  @xmath4 @xmath0  oscillations occur at @xmath12 , this paper intends to show the capabilities of an hybrid emulsion experiment and that the goal for which chorus was designed has been reached .",
    "the cern sps wide band neutrino beam consists essentially of @xmath3 with a contamination of about 5.1% @xmath13 , 0.8% of @xmath11 , and 0.2% of @xmath14 , while the flux of @xmath0  is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the average neutrino energy is 26  @xmath15 , well above the @xmath6 production threshold .",
    "the chorus detector is a hybrid setup which combines a nuclear emulsion target with various electronic detectors such as trigger hodoscopes , a scintillating fibre tracker system , a hadron spectrometer , electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and a muon spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "thanks to its micrometric granularity , nuclear emulsion allows a precise three - dimensional reconstruction of the neutrino interaction vertex as well as of the decay vertices of associated short - lived particles .",
    "it is a powerful detector technique to directly observe @xmath6 decays which , in this experiment , occur on average at a distance of @xmath16 mm from the interaction vertex .",
    "the scintillating fibre tracker system consists of two components : the target tracker ( tt ) , which is the major tool for locating in the emulsion the region where a neutrino interaction has occurred , and the diamond tracker ( dt ) , a set of trackers associated with the hadron spectrometer .",
    "the hadron spectrometer measures the charge and momentum of charged particles using an air - core magnet .",
    "the calorimeter is used to determine the energy of electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "the magnetized iron muon spectrometer determines the charge and momentum of muons .",
    "the emulsion target has an overall mass of 770  @xmath17and is segmented into four stacks .",
    "each stack consists of eight modules with 36 plates of size 36  @xmath18@xmath19  71  @xmath18 .",
    "each plate has a 90  @xmath20plastic base coated on both sides with a 350  @xmath20 emulsion layer .",
    "each stack is followed by three interface emulsion sheets having a 100  @xmath20emulsion layer on both sides of a 800  @xmath20thick plastic base , and by a set of tt planes .",
    "the tt predicts particle trajectories on the interface emulsion sheets with a precision of about 150  @xmath20 in position and 2  @xmath21 in track angle .",
    "the emulsion scanning is performed by computer - controlled , fully automated microscope stages equipped with a ccd camera and a read - out system called ` track selector '  @xcite .",
    "the last generation of automated microscopes used in chorus experiment is the uts ( ` ultra track selector ' )  @xcite . in order to recognize track segments in the emulsion , a series of tomographic images",
    "is taken by focusing at different depths in the emulsion layer .",
    "the digitized images at different levels are shifted according to the predicted track angle and then added .",
    "the presence of aligned grains forming a track is detected as a local peak in the grey - level of the summed image .",
    "the track - finding efficiency is higher than 98% for track slopes less than 400  @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the event reconstruction algorithms have been improved significantly with respect to the phase i analysis described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we only summarize the essential points .",
    "the event reconstruction starts with the pattern recognition in the electronic detectors .",
    "tracks are found in the tt , in the calorimeter and in the muon spectrometer .",
    "if a muon is detected in the downstream detectors the event is classified as @xmath10 , otherwise it is called @xmath9 .",
    "vertices are reconstructed by the electronic detectors using the points of closest approach of the tracks in the tt immediately downstream from the target .",
    "the main vertex is the most upstream one and is selected if it contains either a muon or a hadron surviving criteria which differed in the two phases     in phase i , @xmath9 events , at least one hadron with a momentum less than 20  @xmath22was required . in phase",
    "ii the most isolated hadron was selected regardless of its charge and momentum .    .",
    "such particles or the muon are used as so - called ` scan - back ' tracks .",
    "the impact points of the scan - back tracks are predicted on the most downstream interface emulsion sheets , to initiate their follow back in emulsion .    as in previous analyses",
    "the event reconstruction in emulsion starts with a procedure called ` vertex location ' . as a first step ,",
    "all the tracks in the interface emulsion sheets within an area of 1  @xmath23centred on each scan - back track prediction are collected .",
    "the correct association of emulsion tracks with tt tracks , both in position and direction , requires a precise alignment of the interface emulsions with respect to the fibre - trackers .",
    "the alignment parameters are obtained by finding the best match between the full set of tt predicted tracks and the full set of collected emulsion tracks .",
    "once an emulsion track is associated to a scan - back track , mainly on the basis of their common direction , it is followed upstream from one emulsion plate to the next within a greatly reduced scanning area as the resolution improves . in the emulsion stacks",
    ", the scanning area reduces to a square of 50  @xmath20side . the plate - to - plate alignment is first obtained by a coarse adjustment of reference marks , and , as the scanning procedure continues , is refined by aligning track maps measured in subsequent plates . for this alignment we used tracks of particles generated by neutrino interactions during the whole data taking , of cosmic rays and of muons coming from neighbouring beams .",
    "the scan - back procedure stops when a searched track is not found in two consecutive plates .",
    "the most downstream one is defined as the `` vertex plate '' .",
    "this procedure for locating the vertex has an efficiency of 34% ( table  [ table:0mureconstruction ] ) .",
    "once the vertex plate is found , a new scanning technique is applied on the 19961997 data sample .",
    "originally developed for the donut experiment  @xcite , this technique , called ` netscan ' @xcite , is described in detail in ref .  @xcite together with the event location procedure .",
    "its application to the @xmath9 sample is also described in the following section     the netscan technique has been used also for the @xmath10 data sample , mainly to search for charmed particles decays  @xcite .    .",
    "once the vertex plate is identified , the uts performs a scan of the emulsion volume around the vertex position , recording , for each event , all track segments within 400  @xmath21with respect to the orthogonal direction of the plates . in each plate only the most upstream 100  @xmath20part is scanned .",
    "the scanned volume is @xmath24 wide and 6.3  @xmath25long in the beam direction , corresponding to eight emulsion plates .",
    "this volume contains the vertex plate itself , the plate immediately upstream , and the six plates downstream the vertex plate . the plate upstream the vertex acts as a veto for passing through tracks .",
    "the six plates downstream from the vertex act as decay volume and are used to detect the tracks of the decay daughters .",
    "the scan area is centred on the scan - back track stopping point .",
    "the number of track segments ( coming from particles induced by neutrino interactions , cosmic ray particles and muons from neighbouring beams ) found in each plate depends on the position of the netscan volume with respect to the beam centre and on average is @xmath26 .",
    "the task of the netscan event reconstruction is to select the segments belonging to the neutrino interaction under study , out of this large number of background track segments . to this end , a first plate  to  plate alignment is performed by comparing the pattern of segments in a plate with the corresponding pattern in the next upstream plate .",
    "each segment found in one plate is extrapolated to the next plate where a matching segment is looked for within about 4  @xmath20 in position ( 3@xmath27 of alignment resolution ) and 20 @xmath21 in angle .",
    "if none is found , the straight - line extrapolation is tried one plate further upstream .",
    "a second and more accurate inter - plate alignment is performed using tracks passing through the entire volume after the connection of all matched segments .",
    "these tracks come from muons associated with the neutrino beam or with charged particle beams in the same experimental area . after this fine alignment",
    ", the distribution of the residuals of the segment positions with respect to the fitted track has a standard deviation width of about 0.45  @xmath20 .",
    "after rejection of isolated track segments , typically about 400 tracks remain in the volume .",
    "the majority of these are tracks ( mainly compton electrons and @xmath28-rays ) with a momentum less than 100  @xmath29 .",
    "these background tracks are rejected on the basis of the @xmath30 of a straight - line fit to the track segments .",
    "the final step is the rejection of the tracks not originating from the scan volume .",
    "after this filtering , the average number of remaining tracks is about 40 .",
    "the number of connected tracks and the position and slope residuals provide a good measurement of the alignment quality .",
    "about 84% of the events passes the quality cuts ( ` netscan acquisition accepted ' ) .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm then tries to associate the tracks to vertices with a ` pair - based ' method : after selecting pairs of tracks having minimal distance less than 10  @xmath20 , a clustering among them is performed and vertex points are defined .",
    "after this clustering , a track is attached to a vertex if its distance from the vertex point ( called hereafter ` impact parameter ' ) is less than 3  @xmath20 . at the end of the procedure",
    ", one defines a primary vertex ( and its associated tracks ) and in case one or more secondary vertices to which ` daughter tracks ' are attached .",
    "about 77% of the events , where the netscan acquisition was accepted , have a vertex reconstructed in the netscan volume .",
    "the loss is accounted for by the fact that a background track might have been selected for the scan - back procedure .",
    "the numbers of events at the various stages of the procedure are given in table  [ table:0mureconstruction ] .",
    ".results of the reconstruction of the @xmath9 sample [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      once tracks and vertices are reconstructed in the netscan volume , a search for decay topologies is performed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : netscanevent ] a sketch of a @xmath0 monte carlo event inside the netscan volume is shown : a @xmath0 ( not drawn ) interacts producing a @xmath6 lepton and other particles .",
    "after three plates , the @xmath6 lepton decays producing one charged particle ( kink topology , _",
    "i.e. _ an observed abrupt change of direction in the track ) .",
    "in the decay search an emulsion track is called a ` tt - confirmed track ' if its trajectory matches that of a tt reconstructed track , or if it is connected to a sequence of tt hits .",
    "a reconstructed vertex is a ` tt - confirmed vertex ' if it contains at least one tt - confirmed track .",
    "the decay search is done in two stages :    * an automated search on the whole sample ; * a computer - assisted visual inspection on the sample selected in the previous stage .",
    "after the automated search , 754 events are selected as belonging to one of three categories :    * _ short decays .",

    "the computer - assisted visual inspection aims at clearly establishing the topology of the primary and secondary vertices . to avoid ambiguous topologies , the flight length of the parent track is required to be larger than 25  @xmath20 . for vertices which are not both tt - confirmed ,",
    "a more stringent cut , which is a function of the flight length of the assumed parent , is applied to remove the random association of two unrelated vertices .",
    "an event is selected if one of the following topologies is detected :    * c1 : a track with a kink ( interaction or decay ) of at least 50 mrad * c3 : a track with a three - prong ( interaction or decay ) topology * v2 : a two - prong neutral interaction ( or decay ) is detected    the numbers of events observed in these topologies are shown in table  [ table : selectedevents ] .",
