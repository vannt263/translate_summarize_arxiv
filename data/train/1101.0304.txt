    "@xmath8 charmonium decays have previously attracted interest as an unusual channel for searches for excited @xmath4 nucleon resonances , for example through sequential decays of the type @xmath9 .",
    "recent theoretical work has suggested two additional areas that may be addressed through studies of @xmath8 decays , which expands @xmath4 searches to the following set of topics :    0.3 cm 1 ) investigations of @xmath4 excitations . 0.3 cm 2 ) crossing estimates of cross sections for",
    "the panda processes @xmath5 . 0.3 cm 3 ) estimates of meson - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) strong couplings . 0.3 cm    in this talk i will specialize to the latter two ( more recent ) topics .",
    "reviews of the first topic , @xmath4 spectroscopy from charmonium decays , may be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "as the panda project @xcite plans to produce hybrid charmonium exotics using the associated proton - antiproton production process @xmath5 , there is naturally great interest in the scale of these cross sections for various choices for the charmonium ( or charmonium hybrid ) state @xmath0 and light meson @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about these cross sections .",
    "the only such reaction that has been observed experimentally is @xmath10 , which was studied by e760 and e835 at fermilab .",
    "the data consists of just two e760 data points @xcite for the cross section near the @xmath11 mass and several uncorrected @xcite or unpublished @xcite e835 points . clearly any approach that can give cross section estimates at other energies or in other channels will be of considerable interest to panda .",
    "one interesting possibility is to use bes or cleo - c data on the three body decays @xmath12 to estimate the cross sections for @xmath5 at panda .",
    "this is possible because these two processes are related by crossing , and as such have a common invariant amplitude .",
    "the @xmath13 differential decay rate ( dalitz plot event density ) and @xmath5 differential cross section are given by    @xmath14    and @xmath15 lundborg _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used this crossing relation to estimate near - threshold associated charmonium production cross sections at panda energies from charmonium partial widths under the simplifying assumption of a constant amplitude ; eliminating this constant between the above equations leads to the simple relation @xmath16 .",

    "this simple formula gives results for @xmath18 that are about a factor of 2 - 3 larger than the e760 data points , which is encouraging in view of the simplicity of the approach .",
    "this prediction , together with a range of estimates from a pcac - like hadron pole model introduced by gaillard _",

    "@xcite , who considered aspects of the reaction @xmath18 at lear .",
    "a similar model has since been applied to @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and flavor partners ) in a series of papers by barnes , li and roberts @xcite , who have calculated @xmath23 differential and total cross sections @xcite and @xmath24 dalitz plot densities @xcite . when applied to @xmath12",
    "this model assumes dominance by the feynman diagrams of fig.[f3 ] .",
    "associated charmonium production cross sections from the hadron pole model @xcite .",
    "the data points shown are all for @xmath18 , from e760 ( solid ) @xcite and e835 ( open , unpublished ) @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0 cm    the predictions of this hadron pole model for the panda @xmath23 cross sections are shown in fig.3 . evidently the predicted cross sections for @xmath25 and especially @xmath26 production",
    "are much larger than the 0.1  [ nb ] scale of the only experimentally studied case , @xmath18 .",
    "if correct , this is certainly good news for panda .",
    "these results suggest that c=@xmath27 charmonia may have much larger associated production cross sections at low energies than c=@xmath28 charmonia , perhaps due to the production of c=@xmath27 @xmath29 from a @xmath30 intermediate state .",
    "similar estimates of cross sections for associated processes of the type @xmath31 using this model will be possible given information on the relevant @xmath6 couplings ; the use of @xmath8 to estimate these is discussed below .",

    "cm    meson - baryon strong couplings play many important roles in strong interaction physics ; examples include their use in calculating strong decay widths and branching fractions of excited baryons , and in meson - exchange models of the @xmath7 force . despite their great importance ,",
    "most of these couplings ( which are actually momentum - dependent strong form factors ) are poorly established experimentally .",
    "a rare exception is the pion - nucleon coupling constant , which is @xmath32 .",
    "although other couplings such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 are fitted to data in @xmath7 scattering models , it is not clear whether the assumed meson exchange is actually a realistic description of the short - ranged @xmath7 force .",
    "there is an exciting possibility that @xmath35 strong decays may provide a novel set of estimates of these @xmath6 couplings . to the extent that these decays are well described by the feynman diagrams of fig.2",
    ", @xmath6 couplings may be estimated from the ratio @xmath36 : the _ a priori _ unknown coupling @xmath37 cancels out in this branching fraction ratio , leaving an estimate of the @xmath6 coupling constant ( squared ) . as a test case , an explicit calculation @xcite of @xmath38 using the ratio @xmath39 lead to the estimate",
    "@xmath40 which is consistent with the standard value of @xmath41 .",
    "the same calculation using @xmath42 decays finds a somewhat smaller estimate of @xmath43 , which suggests some complications in this approach .",
    "ideally one should be able to use any initial charmonium state @xmath0 with allowed quantum numbers for these coupling constant estimates , so many cross checks should be possible ; the crucial assumption is that the sequential decay feynman diagrams of fig.2 are dominant .",
    "unfortunately , recent cleo measurements @xcite show that in some @xmath44 decays the dalitz plot event distributions are not consistent with the sequential decay process . in @xmath45 in particular ,",
    "there is clear evidence for dominance of the dalitz plot by a low @xmath19 invariant mass enhancement , as has been noted by bes in several other related charmonium decays . in this case",
    "the theoretical @xmath12 decay model must be extended by the inclusion of this low mass @xmath19 enhancement ; some possible processes that would lead to this effect have been discussed by sibirtsev _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "one possibility for an @xmath6 coupling measurement in a decay that does not have a strong low mass @xmath19 final state enhancement @xcite is @xmath46 , which may allow estimates of the two @xmath33 couplings @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since the @xmath22 plays a very important role in @xmath7 force models as the origin of short - ranged @xmath7 repulsion , and the @xmath49 dalitz plot event distribution has been shown to be quite sensitive to the anomalous coupling @xmath48 in the hadron pole model @xcite , it would be very interesting to carry out such a study .",
