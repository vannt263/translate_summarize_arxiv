    "the classical theory of elasticity consists of a macroscopic material description . the material is not described at the micro - level by considering the displacement of the different particles in interaction , but is described as a continuum by considering macroscopic quantities as stress and strain .",
    "the classical elasticity theory can be viewed as a first gradient of the displacement field approximation of solid state theory @xcite and is thus valid in the long wavelength limit only . granular media , due to their micro - inhomogeneous character , are not well described by the standard continuum theory of elasticity .",
    "in contrast to classical continua , where the sizes of the vibrating atoms can be assumed to be negligible compared to the macroscale , the sizes of the particles in a granular assembly are comparable to it @xcite .",
    "in addition , considering the sliding , twisting and rolling resistances at the level of the contacts between the particles , a consistent description of the elasticity of a granular medium needs to take into account all the rotational degrees of freedom of each individual particle and thus all the relative degrees of each pair .",
    "+ considering this , the elastic behaviors of crystalline structures of monodisperse beads can be efficiently described by a discrete model , where the displacement and rotation of each individual bead are taken into account .",
    "one of the major differences with classical elasticity is the existence of optical - type rotational - related modes of wave propagation .",
    "especially , the dispersion relations given by the discrete model of the bulk waves propagating in crystalline structures of contacting monodisperse beads , without solid bridges between them , is consistent with experimental results @xcite in a hexagonal close - packed structure , and with numeric simulation results in a face - centered cubic structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the discrete model can be solved analytically only for well - know regular crystalline structures , the case of a random assembly of beads can be done @xcite but is too complex for large systems . moreover , due to diffraction scattering and attenuation effects , even for a small level of randomness , only long wavelength waves will propagate in a granular assembly @xcite .",
    "more specifically , only the long wavelength waves can propagate in as a coherent ballistic wave @xcite .",
    "considering that only the long wavelength waves will propagate in random assemblies , which differs from the ideal crystalline case , and that their discrete modeling is too complex , a continuum formulation seems more suitable .",
    "a continuum model is also relevant when considering the wave propagation in a granular assembly in contact with an elastic solid @xcite .",
    "+ the generalization of the classical elasticity theory accounting for the rotational degrees of freedom of bodies is known as the cosserat theory @xcite .",
    "but , from a direct comparison between the dispersion relations predicted with a discrete model and with the ones of a cosserat model , the latter does not predict correctly the dispersion relations of the modes of propagation related to the rotational motion of the beads @xcite .",
    "similarly , the simulation results of a couette shear cell differ from the predictions of a cosserat model @xcite . despite many theoretical efforts ,",
    "the comparison between experimental results and predictions from the cosserat theory remains inconclusive ; a consistent continuum description of granular assemblies is still challenging , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "as it will be shown below , one of the interactions , or relative degrees of freedom , between the beads involving the rotational degrees of freedom is not modeled properly leading to inconsistent results .",
    "the drawback of the cosserat theory can be overcome using a second - order gradient theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the second - order gradient micropolar theory introduces three new elastic tensors , which involve too many new elastic constants to represent a feasible alternative to the discrete modeling .",
