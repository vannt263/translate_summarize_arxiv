    "the non - local phase in @xmath123 reflects the fact that when we interpret the inter - chain coupling in terms of one - dimensional interactions in the chain @xmath124 , it is a non - local one .",
    "the situation is simplified when the tunneling within each chain is suppressed , @xmath32 in equation ( 3 ) in the main text , and with the onsite constraint @xmath33 .",
    "then , for both hard - core bosons and fermions we can regard the two chains as two spin states , and perform the mapping @xmath125 where the last one is a constraint . here @xmath126 can be either bosons or fermions . then the model becomes @xmath127",

    "but once the exact eigenstates and eigenvalues are obtained , the evolution operator at any moment can be immediately obtained .",
    "in contrast , for dmrg methods , the calculation time grows linearly for larger system sizes when the  bond dimension \" ( to be discussed below ) is fixed .",
    "the restriction is that the required bond dimension grows exponentially with larger number of periods due to higher needs for accuracy . in sum , ed is suitable for checking late - time dynamics for smaller system sizes , while dmrg can give the early time behaviors for a large system .",
    "we next discuss the details and more numerical results of dmrg analysis .    for a system with @xmath10 sites ,",
    "we denote the local basis states as @xmath137 ( @xmath138 $ ] ) so the many - body basis states are @xmath139 .",

    "in recent years , dipolar atoms ( i.e. @xmath169er @xcite , @xmath170dy , @xmath171dy , @xmath172dy @xcite ) and molecules ( i.e. @xmath173k@xmath110rb @xcite , @xmath174na@xmath173k @xcite , @xmath174na@xmath110rb @xcite , @xmath110rb@xmath175cs @xcite ) have been widely prepared in cold atom experiments .",
    "here we consider for example the fermionic molecule @xmath176na@xmath173k prepared by martin zwierlein s group at mit , where the stable ground state of the feshbach molecules has been achieved .",
    "note that the ground state for @xmath174na@xmath173k is a spin singlet , and therefore the fermionic nature of the dipolar molecule forbids double - occupancy of the same site due to pauli blocking .",
    "thus , there is no onsite interactions in addition to the dipolar one .",
    "( for bosonic molecules , one can similarly consider a deep optical lattice with strong onsite @xmath177-wave repulsive interaction , such that double occupancy is also suppressed in such a hard - core regime . in the following we focus on fermionic particles and do not elaborate on the bosonic case ) .",
    "we propose using 2 beams of laser to form a double - well potential and to trap the gas in a quasi-1d system ; and then using an additional pair of laser beams to form 1d optical lattices .",
    "the schematic plot is given in fig.[fig : dipolescheme ] .",
    "note that the double well potential can be engineered in cold atom experiments in multiple ways , and here we adopt one of the schemes given in ref.@xcite .",
    "our modification is to increase the anisotropy for the beams in fig.[fig : dipolescheme](b ) so a quasi-1d system is formed .",
    "the whole optical potential can be read as @xmath178 the combined potential is given in the maintext by fig.4 . here @xmath179 , so the red - detuned beam functions as an overall anisotropic harmonic trap for a quasi-1d system , while the blue - detuned beam gives the barrier between two wells .",
    "@xmath180 controls the distance between the two chains , and @xmath181 tunes the height of the barrier and therefore the tunneling .",
    "the height and width can be tuned accurately within a wide range@xcite , providing feasible platform for the quench process .",
    "also note that the initial state where particles fill up one of the two chains can be prepared by slowly moving the barrier from the edge to the center@xcite .",
    "a general electric dipole interaction reads @xmath182 here @xmath183 is the dipole strength , @xmath184 is the dielectric constant in vacuum .",
    "@xmath185 are the coordinate of the location for the two dipoles .",
    "@xmath186 is the distance for the two dipoles , and @xmath187 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath188 is the direction where the dipole is pointing to .    for ultracold dipolar gases , the dipole direction @xmath188 is usually polarized by a uniform electric field , so @xmath189 as @xmath190 .",
    "then we can denote the site - independent electric field direction as @xmath191 , and @xmath192    during @xmath41 , we consider electric field within the plane perpendicular to chain , forming an angle @xmath16 with respect to the quasi-1d plane , as shown in fig.[fig : dipolar - polarization](a ) . as such",
    ", the interaction within each chain ( i.e. within chain a ) is @xmath193 for interaction between two chains , @xmath194 in general , the inter - chain interaction is never strictly zero : one can consider the limit where two sites separate far away in the x - direction , @xmath195 , then @xmath196 .",
    "however , we note that the dipole interaction strength decays to the third power with respect to distance , and we can approximate a vanishing inter - chain interaction strength if the nearby sites have vanishing inter - chain interaction strength . specifically ,",
    "we choose a large @xmath197 , and let @xmath198 in fig.[fig : dipolar - polarization](b ) , we plot the interaction strength for intra - chain and inter - chain sites , with @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the lattice spacing . we clearly see that for small @xmath100 , the interaction strength between different chains are vanishingly small .",
    "the large separation of two chains is also helpful for distinguishing particles in two chains in the imaging process",
    ".    one may be worried whether the long - range part of the inter - chain interactions may play important roles .",
    "the concern derives from the experience in equilibrium systems , where the long - range tail of the interactions , albeit weak , can possibly change qualitative behaviors of the system .",
    "for instance , a coulomb type of long - range interaction may induce a wigner crystal behavior , while if one cuts off the interaction beyond certain distance , the phase may be qualitatively changed .",
    "however , note that here we are dealing with a highly non - equilibrium system subject to repeated quenches .",
    "the interaction does not last for infinitely long as in thermal equilibrium before the hamiltonian is quenched .",
    "therefore , we expect the weak long - range part of the inter - chain interaction exhibits negligible effects in our system .",
    "there are four parameters in the model ( equation ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) in the main text ) : @xmath201 for inter - chain and intra - chain tunneling , @xmath103 for dipolar interaction strength , and @xmath36 for global chemical potential bias between two chains .",
    "these parameters also give the duration time for each quench period , and constrain how many periods can we have for one experiment . here",
    "@xmath202 are all controlled by optical potential and can be tuned within a wide range in cold atom experiments .",
    "the chief constraint comes from dipolar interaction strength @xmath103 . here",
    "we take the number from ref@xcite .",
    "written in our notations , @xmath203 where @xmath204debye is the dipole strength , 1debye@xmath205 ; @xmath206 is the dielectric constant in vacuum ; @xmath200 is the lattice spacing within each chain .",
    "we set @xmath207 then @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the planck constant .",
    "take a typical number for experiments , @xmath210 @xcite , @xmath211@xcite , we have @xmath212hz . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical lifetime for the dipolar system is a few seconds@xcite .",
    "thus , we estimate that a typical experiment can undergo several hundreds of floquet periods .    during @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath213 in equation ( [ eq : dipole ] ) takes large value and the barrier @xmath181 is lowered , so there is effectively only tunneling between the rungs of the ladder . as discussed before , the electric field is along the @xmath214 direction .",
    "then the dipole interaction within the same chain is strictly zero , while interaction between different chains are smaller than @xmath215 .",
    "note the tunneling strength @xmath216 is of the order of @xmath217hz .",
    ", where @xmath218 is the wave vector for lasers , @xmath105 is the mass for molecules . for @xmath174na@xmath173k , @xmath219 kg , and",
    "the laser wavelength is of the order of @xmath220 ; then , @xmath221 is of the order of @xmath222hz .",
    "the tunneling strength goes down exponentially as one ramps up the lattice depth so completely isolated lattice sites can be easily achieved ( for dipolar molecules in optical lattices , see i.e. @xcite ) ] thus , during @xmath37 we can safely neglect dipole interactions and achieve @xmath123 given by equation ( 2 ) in the main text .",
    "the duration @xmath37 is given by @xmath223 , which is typically tens of miliseconds .    during @xmath41 ,",
    "one ramps up the inter - chain barrier @xmath181 and turns down the 1d lattice potential @xmath213 . also , one turns down the electric field so that the dipole moment goes down",
    ". then each chain separately undergoes intra - chain tunneling @xmath224 as well as dipolar interactions .",
    "the duration can be estimated by @xmath225 .          for su(n )",
    "particles , each `` chain '' is represented by different internal states , i.e. the spin @xmath226 .",
    "thus , we only need a double - well potential to represent the `` rung '' direction , i.e. removing the @xmath213 in equation ( [ eq : dipole ] ) .",
    "the initial state consists of @xmath227 particles confined within one of the two wells .    in principle",
    ", one can use raman coupling of different spin states to engineer the `` tunneling '' @xmath224 within each chain along the synthetic dimension .",
    "moreover , the tunneling term @xmath224 can be a complex number , which may lead to interesting phenomenon , such as quantum - hall like physics@xcite , due to the non - zero flux within a plaquettee of the ladder .",
    "we leave the discussion for raman - coupled spin states for future work , and here only focus on the @xmath32 situation , which is easier to implement in experiments .      the key feature of su(n )",
    "particles is that due to the lack of electronic spin ( so the hyperfine spin equals the nuclear spin ) , the collisions between su(n ) particles does not flip the hyperfine spin state .",
    "thus , the hyperfine magnetic quantum number @xmath228 functions as a good quantum number representing the ( spin-)site index . we can estimate the interaction strength @xmath229 in our model by noting that the scattering lengths @xcite @xmath230 the interaction strength @xmath231 where @xmath105 is the mass for su(n ) particles , and @xmath232 is the wave function for an atom in one of the double well potential .",
    "note that both the scattering lengths and the mass for @xmath233yb are about twice as much as those for @xmath110sr ; therefore , the interaction strengths @xmath103 for these two types of atoms are actually the same , depending only on the size of the wave function . note that as an estimation , we can approximate @xmath234 , where @xmath26 is the size of the wave function that can be tuned by changing the depth and size of the double - well potential .",
    "consider , for example , that @xmath235 , we have @xmath236 then for @xmath237 , we have @xmath238 miliseconds .",
    "note that the size of the well ( a few micrometers ) we consider is much larger than the scattering lengths ( [ sunscattering ] ) .",
    "so it is not in a `` deep optical lattice '' regime where atom loss may be severe due to 3-atom recombinations @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the life - time for the system is the same as a typical su(n ) fermion system , which can last for a few seconds .",
    "that implies that a few hundreds of floquet periods can be observed .",
    "finally , we note that during @xmath37 , as estimated in the case of dipolar gases , the tunneling strength @xmath216 is of the order of @xmath217hz , which is several orders of magnitudes larger than the interaction strength @xmath229 .",
    "thus , we can treat the system in this regime as non - interacting particles , and end up with @xmath123 in equation ( 2 ) in the main text .",
    "( in principle , one can further apply a magnetic field to reduce the interaction strength @xcite ) .",

    "<S> time crystals , a phase showing spontaneous breaking of time - translation symmetry , has been an intriguing subject for systems far away from equilibrium . </S>",

    "<S> a general feature of these systems is that certain physical observable @xmath0 shows a rigid reduced periodicity @xmath1 , compared with the floquet driving period @xmath2 of the hamiltonian @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as originally conceptualized by wilczek@xcite , `` time - crystals '' are regarded as a new addition to the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking , for the temporal translation symmetry missing for nearly a century .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of time crystal phase also challenges our understanding of driven interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> conventional wisdom tends to divide such systems into two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> when the driving amplitudes are small and the frequencies differ much from the system s internal energy scales , one may expect an effectively time - independent description @xcite , such as the adiabatic charge - pumping @xcite or the time - averaged lattice shaking@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in such situations , the system approaches an ( almost ) static and equilibrium one where a no - go theorem forbids the existence of time crystals@xcite . in the opposite situation with resonant driving frequencies and large amplitudes , the system is inclined towards chaotic behaviors , such as turbulence@xcite , which may eventually thermalize due to heating . </S>",
    "<S> the surprise comes with the pioneering works @xcite that the `` chaotic regime '' also harbors the time crystal phase with locked frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to ask what serves as the stabilizers against the butterfly effects and heating .    </S>",
    "<S> a key strategy in recent theories is to take advantage of non - ergodic systems to resist thermalization @xcite , which at least guarantees the non - trivial dynamics at late time . besides the integrable systems that are vulnerable against perturbations , many - body localized ( mbl ) systems consist of the most well - studied examples of robust non - ergodic systems . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it is assumed a priori in most theories that stable time - crystal phase can only occur in the mbl regime with strong spatial disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a recent experiment on nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers performed by lukin s team at harvard demonstrated an alternative possibility @xcite , where time crystals formed regardless of the delocalization in the three - dimensional spin system . it was also pointed out that the system is not in a pre - thermal regime@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental breakthrough indicates the tantalizing possibility of extending the candidate pool for stable time - crystals to include weakly disordered or even clean systems .    the purpose of this work is to explore such possibilities , and to discuss its characters and realizations in cold atom systems . </S>",

    "<S> we give a phenomenological definition of non - equilibrium time crystal by selecting oscillations that are emergent from many - body dynamics , rather than being dictated strictly by the hamiltonian . </S>",
