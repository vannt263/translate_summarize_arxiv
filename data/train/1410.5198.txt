    "the @xmath70 symmetry of the l phase arises from a @xmath71-spin - rotation along the axis parallel to @xmath90 .",
    "while direction of @xmath90 is not well defined in general as one needs two real vectors to capture the information contained in @xmath90 , the property @xmath91 of the l phase implies that @xmath90 can be written as a real vector times a phase factor .",

    "are not distinguished any more .",
    "while the presented calculations were performed with density - density interaction @xmath20 only , real materials usually possess the full spin rotational invariance , which is restored by the first term of @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore important to show that including @xmath21 does not lead to qualitatively different results .",
    "considering @xmath21 we have to distinguish the case with ( @xmath94 ) and without ( @xmath95 ) pair - hopping , which breaks the separate conservations of @xmath72 and @xmath73 charge .",
    "the symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) with @xmath21 is @xmath96 in the former case and @xmath97 in the latter one .",
    "we will consider the latter case and show that it leads to the same phases as the density - density interaction with no cross - hopping .",
    "first , we discuss the landau functional .",
    "treating @xmath69 as a 3-dimensional complex vector the landau functional must be a rotationally invariant function of two vectors @xmath98 , which implies that its taylor expansion must be a polynomial in @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "@xcite moreover , @xmath98 must be invariant with respect to the overall phase of @xmath69 ( due to @xmath16 and @xmath95 ) .",

    "however , since the spin - flip term does not allow independent spin rotations about the @xmath74-axis we have to assume @xmath106 from the beginning .",
    "the symmetries of the e phase thus must fulfill @xmath107 and @xmath82 , i.e. , only @xmath76 symmetry corresponding to the conservation of total charge is preserved .",
    "the invariance of @xmath69 in the c phase is less restrictive .",
    "the condition @xmath108 leads to residual symmetry @xmath84 allowing also spin rotations accompanied by change of the relative phase of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 orbitals . as in the density - density case ,",
    "non - zero cross - hopping or pair - hopping removes the distinction between the c and e phases .",
    "finally , if @xmath109 we can choose the @xmath74-axis parallel to @xmath110 , in which case the only non - zero component of @xmath69 , @xmath111 , is invariant under @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath112 spin rotation ( besides the overall phase change ) , which correspond to the @xmath70 symmetry of the l phase in the density - density case .",
    "note , that the non - trivial @xmath76 symmetries of the c and l phase are different .",
    "while the former one contains spin - rotations about an axis perpendicular to @xmath69 combined with orbital phase transformations , the latter one consists of pure spin - rotations about an axis parallel to @xmath69 .",
    "while the same excitonic phases exist in the model with and without @xmath21 the space of low - energy fluctuations of the order parameter , which reflects the broken symmetries , will be quite different in the two cases .",
    "since our numerical method does not treat these fluctuations we do not discuss them here .",
    "the above numerical results have demonstrated the rich phase diagram of the excitonic condensate .",
    "the key feature allowing the various phases is the orbital - off - diagonal character , which renders the order parameter complex . were the order parameter real , such as the usual spontaneous magnetization , only one phase would have been possible since all real magnetization vectors of the same magnitude can be connected by some spin rotation ( this does exclude multiple phases with different translational symmetry , e.g. , ferro and antiferro ) .",
    "this is not true for complex vectors . to see this",
    ", one can consider the vector product @xmath113 , which is invariant under rotations as well as overall phase transformation .",
    "two states characterized by order parameters with the same magnitude @xmath114 but different @xmath113 can not be transformed into one another by a symmetry operation of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is easy to see that the l phase corresponds to @xmath109 , while for the c phase @xmath115 .    how do the different ec states look like in the direct space ?",
    "halperin and rice  @xcite have shown that exciton condensation in the spin - triplet channel gives rise either to a spin - density or a spin - current - density wave .",
    "assuming real wannier orbitals @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and neglecting ( although this is not essential ) the overlap density of orbitals on different sites , the exciton condensation gives rise to the spin - density @xmath118 and the spin - current density @xmath119  @xcite @xmath120 on each lattice site . in our model with @xmath20 only , the spin polarization is confined to @xmath80@xmath121 plane .",
    "note that the total integrated spin moment or integrated spin current in ( [ eq : dnst ] ) are zero .",
    "real @xmath43 thus gives rise to magnetic multipoles , precise form of which depends on the shapes of orbital @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "however , since the low lying excitations in general do not correspond to direct space rotations of these multipoles , we do not find it useful to speak about multipole order .",
    "in fact , in the present case with @xmath16 a spin - density state can be continuously rotated into a spin - current state , by varying the phase of @xmath69 , without any energy cost . in the l phase ,",
    "all cartesian components of @xmath69 can be made simultaneously real or imaginary , thus corresponding to a purely spin - density or a spin - current state .",
    "non - zero cross hopping @xmath52 removes the degeneracy of spin - density and spin - current states .",
    "@xcite    in the c and e phases , on the other hand , a finite phase difference between the cartesian components of @xmath69 implies that both the spin density and spin current must be simultaneously present . in these phases , breaking of the @xmath70 symmetry in the hamiltonian with @xmath20 only gives rise to a net spin moment along the @xmath74-axis . in case with @xmath122 symmetry of the coulomb interaction , @xmath69 can point in arbitrary direction and",

    "in the weak coupling limit the excitonic condensation is driven by the @xmath140 term in ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) .",
    "the repulsion between electrons in the same orbital @xmath141 favors the polarized c phase over l phase since the expectation value @xmath142 vanishes in the former .",
    "we close the discussion by a technical remark .",
    "while the exciton condensation is obtained also in a static hartree theory , the full treatment of the local dynamics is crucial to obtain the different excitonic phases .",
    "our brief experimenting with hartree theory revealed a strong bias towards the polarized c phase , which can be traced back to the minimization of @xmath142 . in a static theory this is achieved by polarizing the system while in the dynamic theory these terms are strongly suppressed already in the normal phase .",

    "the spin - triplet orbital - off - diagonal order parameter allows several thermodynamic phases .",
    "varying temperature and the chemical potential of the system we have observed all the symmetry allowed phases including those with induced ferromagnetic polarization .",
    "the transitions at low temperatures are of the first order accompanied by a charge separation . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "however , the transitions become continuous .",
    "the ferromagnetic polarization exhibits a large reversible response to small changes of the chemical potential in this regime .",
    "this effect can be used to construct devices where magnetization is switched reversibly by means of a gate voltage .",
    "we thank p. augustinsk , a. kauch , v. pokorn , d. vollhardt , and a.  p. kampf for discussions and valuable suggestions .",
    "we acknowledge the support of deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through for1346 and the grant agency of the czech republic through project 13 - 25251s .      in order to analyze the behavior of ( [ eq : landau1 ] ) in the vicinity of the multi - critical point we write the functional to the 8th order in @xmath43 and use polar coordinates in the @xmath22@xmath23 plane : @xmath143 where @xmath144 . for sufficiently small @xmath145 and @xmath61 , @xmath146 has approximately the form of a mexican hat with the radial minima @xmath147 on a circle @xmath148 .",
    "the terms containing @xmath149 cause a deformation of @xmath147 from the circular shape and lift the degeneracy of @xmath150 along @xmath147 .",
    "our strategy will be to analyze this effect in different orders of @xmath145 .",
    "behavior of the stationary points of @xmath146 depends on the direction in which the limit @xmath151 is taken .",
    "we specify the limit by introducing a parameter @xmath152 : @xmath153 .",
    "the variation of landau functional along the contour of radial minima @xmath147 is given by @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath147 itself fulfills the equation @xmath155 solving ( [ eq : radial ] ) in the form of a power series @xmath156 we get @xmath157 substituting this expansion into ( [ eq : landau ] ) we arrive at the expansion of @xmath158 @xmath159 where we have dropped the @xmath160-constant terms . for a general @xmath152 , @xmath161 appears in the order @xmath162 while @xmath163 appears first in the order @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , with the exception of @xmath165 where the @xmath162 term in ( [ eq : expand ] ) vanishes , the @xmath161 term is dominant for a sufficiently small @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath161 has a unique minimum either at @xmath166 or at @xmath167 , depending on the sign of the prefactor .",
    "the functional ( [ eq : landau ] ) in this limit thus yields a single stable phase - the c phase ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath168 and l phase for @xmath169 .",
    "varying @xmath152 across the @xmath165 the minimum and maximum of @xmath158 switch and there is a transition between the c and l phases .",
    "this transition can happen in one of two distinct ways , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] . to see this we keep @xmath145 fixed ( and sufficiently small so that all @xmath170 terms in @xmath158 are irrelevant ) . in a narrow interval of @xmath152 ( of the width of order @xmath145 ) in the vicinity of @xmath165 the @xmath162 contribution to @xmath158 vanishes and",
    "@xmath158 has the form @xmath171 with coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 of comparable sizes .",
    "this angular form offers only three possibilities for its stationary points : i ) the only stationary points are at @xmath166 and @xmath172 , in which case one of them must be maximum and the other one minimum corresponding to a single stable phase , either l or c , ii ) there is a single local maximum between 0 and @xmath172 , in which case there must be local minima at 0 and @xmath172 corresponding to l and c phases being simultaneously stable , iii ) there is a single local minimum between 0 and @xmath172 corresponding to the e phase , in which case there must be local maxima at 0 and @xmath172 and thus e being the only stable phase . while ( i ) includes the case where the @xmath161 term is dominant , the transition between the c and l can only take place by passing through ( ii ) , i.e. , a first order transition , or ( iii ) , i.e. , two continuous transitions with an intermediate e phase ."
