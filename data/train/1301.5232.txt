    "since the formulation of classical general relativity by einstein in 1915 , analytic solutions have made a large contribution to the understanding of its meanings and proving its properties . a crucial role in this process",
    "was played by black hole solutions , as their description requires the full generality of einstein s theory .",
    "therefore black hole solutions could be expected to exhibit inherent effects of general relativity .",
    "indeed , the schwarzschild solution containing a single mass parameter @xmath0 was able to explain the perihelion precession of mercury and the bending of light rays around the sun .",
    "the kerr solution extended the class of black hole solutions by the parameter of angular momentum @xmath1 , led to the discovery of ergospheres and permitted the rigorous investigation of the lense - thirring effect .",
    "furthermore , adding a charge parameter @xmath2 completes the class of stationary black hole solutions by delivering the most general kerr - newman solution , see @xcite .",
    "interestingly , static spherically symmetric ideal fluid configurations have a minimal radius , given by @xmath3 times the corresponding schwarzschild radius and thus fail to feature a continuous connection to black holes @xcite .",
    "the analytic solution of the problem of a rigidly rotating uncharged disc of dust , in contrast , provides an example for a parametric transition of equilibrium configurations of ordinary matter to an extreme kerr black hole @xcite , see also @xcite . rotating fluid rings admit such a black hole limit too @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the so called electrically counterpoised dust ( ecd ) configurations , a class of static solutions of dust with a particular constant specific charge , possess a parametric transition to the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole , see @xcite .",
    "inspired by these opposite limiting cases , we conjecture that the dust disc with a constant specific charge varying from zero to the ecd value has a parametric transition to the extreme kerr - newman black hole . the parameter spaces of black holes and charged dust discs and their connections are illustrated in . in order to investigate this assumption and to support the search for the analytic solution of the charged disc , a post - newtonian expansion is performed .",
    "we note that in the uncharged case , the analytic disc solution @xcite was indeed preceded by the partly numerical but highly accurate bardeen - wagoner expansion @xcite , which could later be recovered from the analytic solution @xcite .",
    "the charged disc is expected to show novel effects due to the interplay between electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "to facilitate analytic calculations , we employed the following simplifying assumptions :    firstly , we use the model of dust , i.e.  pressureless matter described by the dust part of the energy momentum tensor in .",
    "moreover , we assume a rigid rotation with a constant angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the dust we consider here contains the constant specific charge @xmath5 $ ] so that the charge density @xmath6 and the baryonic mass density @xmath7 are connected via @xmath8 ( we use gauss units and @xmath9 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume axial symmetry and stationarity described by the killing vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as reflectional symmetry w.r.t .",
    "an `` equatorial plane '' .",
    "we start with einstein s field equations @xmath12 and the covariant maxwell equations @xmath13}=0,\\qquad",
    "f^{ab}_{\\quad;b}=4\\pi \\jmath^a   \\label{maxwell_gl},\\ ] ] wherein the energy momentum tensor @xmath14 is simply the sum of an electromagnetic part and a dust part : @xmath15 for the purely convective four - current density holds @xmath16 .",
    "the metric can globally be written in terms of weyl - lewis - papapetrou coordinates as : @xmath17-f\\left(\\mathrm{d}t+a\\mathrm{d } \\varphi\\right)^2 .\\ ] ] moreover , a four - potential of the form @xmath18 can be introduced by @xmath19 , which automatically fulfils the homogeneous maxwell equations .",
    "the coordinates correspond to the killing vectors via @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so that all the five free functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend only on the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 is made up from a surface mass density by @xmath29 note that two other definitions of surface mass density will later be used : @xmath30 , directly linked with the boundary conditions , and the coordinate independent proper surface mass density @xmath31 .",
    "the coupled nonlinear system of differential equations that emerge can be reformulated as a boundary value problem for the equations valid in the ( electro-)vacuum outside the disc .      in the absence of matter",
    ", the einstein - maxwell equations can be reduced to the ernst equations .",
    "they are expressed in two additional potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using the abbreviations @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "these potentials are defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 thereby the complex ernst potentials @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be introduced : @xmath40 in these terms the ernst equations read @xcite @xmath41 where the behaviour of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is analogous to that in euclidean 3-space , with cylindrical coordinates @xmath44 .",
    "the metric function @xmath23 is eliminated during this process of transforming the field equations to the ernst equations and can be determined by integration afterwards . for the purpose of the post - newtonian expansion ,",
    "it is helpful to express the ernst equations in terms of the real functions @xmath22 , @xmath45 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which leads to @xmath46      to describe the influence of the matter , we have to return to the full einstein - maxwell equations .",

    "these matching conditions are transformed to the following four boundary conditions by the use of reflectional symmetry : @xmath51 back in the nonrotating frame they take the form : @xmath52 the treatment in the nonrotating frame is justified by the simple boundary conditions at spatial infinity , which are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 in that system .",
    "overall we have the 4 differential equations  and the 4 boundary conditions  for the 6 expansion functions @xmath22 , @xmath45 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath55 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , due to the definitions and , only 4 of these functions are independent and therefore the disc problem is well posed .",
    "we introduce the relativity parameter @xmath56 , which was already successfully used for the post - newtonian expansion of the uncharged disc @xcite : @xmath57 the parameter @xmath56 is closely related to the redshift @xmath58 of a photon emitted at the center of the disc and measured at infinity : @xmath59 therefore , it is not surprising that the transition to a black hole happens at @xmath60 for the uncharged and the ecd case .",
    "the parameter space of the charged disc as shown in ( w.l.o.g . restricted to positive charges ) is now strongly conjectured to be the area @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] shown in .        as a third parameter",
    ", the disc radius @xmath63 is added .",
    "it naturally comes into play by introducing elliptic coordinates through @xmath64 and carries the whole information about the scale of the disc . by the usage of elliptic coordinates and by multiplying powers of @xmath63 to unit carrying quantities",
    ", the whole disc problem can be made dimensionless .",
    "those normalized quantities , labeled with a star , are for example @xmath65      inspired by the newtonian disc of charged dust ( in the newtonian limit we have @xmath66 with the newtonian potential @xmath67 ) , the squared angular velocity is expanded as a power series in @xmath56 : @xmath68 the angular velocity @xmath69 is therefore described by an odd series in @xmath70 : @xmath71    all the previously discussed functions are now either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to a change of the sense of rotation @xmath72 . as such , they can be expressed either in even or odd power series of @xmath70 .",
    "the lowest occuring power is determined by the newtonian limit . on the whole",
    "we get @xmath73 the remaining coefficients are still functions of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these expansions are inserted in the 12 equations ",
    ",  plus and .",
    "these 12 equations , which we call expansion equations , are now evaluated by equating coefficients of powers of @xmath56 in order to obtain analytic expressions .",
    "the expansion equations in @xmath76-th order read : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 for clarity , only coefficient functions of @xmath76-th order have been written down , and terms of lower orders in each equation are subsumed in the symbol @xmath80 .",
    "these functions @xmath80 all vanish for @xmath81 so that the first order equations reduce to coupled laplace equations with boundary conditions .",
    "the gravitational and the electric potential of the newtonian disc are reproduced through @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see ) . for @xmath84 ,",
    "none of the functions @xmath80 vanish and we get coupled poisson equations .",
    "the requirement for asymptotical flatness implies that all the 6 coefficient functions @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 have to vanish at spatial infinity .",
    "a very helpful observation comes from the fact that all expansion functions are polynomials in @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the functions @xmath80 ( besides a factor of @xmath91 in the @xmath92 ) are also polynomials in @xmath75 and the poisson inhomogeneity can thus be fragmented to legendre polynomials .",
    "then the poisson equation with an inhomogeneity consisting of a single legendre polynomial , @xmath93_{,\\xi}+\\left[(1-\\eta^2)\\psi_{,\\eta } \\right]_{,\\eta}\\right\\rbrace = \\frac{i(\\xi)p_n(\\eta)}{\\xi^2+\\eta^2},\\ ] ] is transformed by the ansatz @xmath94 into the ordinary differential equation @xmath95_{,\\xi}-n(n+1)a = i(\\xi).\\ ] ] two independent ( real ) solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation are @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the legendre functions of the second kind .",
    "now the inhomogeneous solution can be composed as @xmath98 with adequately chosen constants @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the boundary conditions at @xmath101 and @xmath102 can be fulfilled respectively .",
    "in addition to the 12 expansion equations  , two parameter relations are necessary to determine an integration constant and the scalar component @xmath103 for each order .",
    "first , from , we immediately obtain at @xmath104 , @xmath105 @xmath106 secondly , the following relation to the surface mass density can be derived analogously to the derivation of the boundary conditions ( @xmath107 still collects lower order terms ) : @xmath108 = 8\\pi\\varrho_0\\sigma_k+ f_{\\rm reg2k } \\label{regk}\\ ] ] in order to have a finite value of @xmath109 at the rim of the disc , @xmath110 , the expression @xmath111 $ ] has to contain a global factor @xmath75 .",
    "the integration constants of the other unknown functions vanish due to reflectional symmetry .",
    "the system of expansion equations can be dealt with by setting up the linear combination @xmath112 .",
    "this provides a quantity with a given poisson inhomogeneity and a given boundary condition : @xmath113 once @xmath114 is determined according to 4.2 , @xmath85 can be determined by and @xmath86 is immediately obtained .",
    "hereupon @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be computed successively out of poisson boundary value problems and @xmath89 and @xmath90 eventually by integration .",
    "with the methods described above and making use of mathematica by wolfram research , coefficient functions of the 6 expansion functions could be calculated up to the eighth order .",
    "the first important observation is that these coefficient functions are not only polynomial in @xmath75 but also in @xmath74 and @xmath115 .",
    "the first 2 orders are listed in the appendix , higher orders are available as data files .",
    "noteworthy are the global prefactors in the expansion functions , which could be found in all of their coefficients : @xmath116 within the expansion , the angular velocity @xmath69 is also calculated .",
    "it is depicted in up to the eighth order .",
    ", the angular velocity normalized by the disc radius . ]    here the parameter space ( ) is shown in the @xmath56-@xmath117 plane .",
    "@xmath69 vanishes at the transition to the static configurations for @xmath118 and in the extreme relativistic limit ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the latter is caused by the vanishing disc radius @xmath63 .",
    "this shows that @xmath63 is no longer a well chosen parameter for @xmath60 .",
    "the further evaluation of the results is done by discussing global quantities of the disc .",
    "the gravitational mass @xmath0 , the charge @xmath2 and the angular momentum @xmath1 can be conveniently deduced from the far field behaviour of the expansion functions : @xmath119 one compelling feature of the disc with constant specific charge , is that even the baryonic mass @xmath120 can be derived from the asymptotical behaviour .",
    "based on this , the relative binding energy @xmath121 can be directly calculated ( even in the limit @xmath122 ) .",
    "it is depicted in up to the seventh significant order .",
    "the first three orders read @xmath123\\gamma^3      + \\mathcal{o}\\left(\\gamma^4\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all seven orders are given in the appendix .        at this point",
    ", the accuracy of the expansion can be tested by comparison with the known analytic solution of the uncharged disc .",
    "the potentially most critical point is @xmath124 , where the transition to the extreme kerr black hole occurs . here",
    "the numerically evaluated expansion gives @xmath125 , which differs from the analytic value @xmath126 @xcite by about @xmath127 . in the uncharged limit ( @xmath122 ) , the expressions for the remaining nontrivial functions @xmath22 and @xmath24 agree with an expansion of the analytic solution of the uncharged disc @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results for the global quantities for @xmath122 comply with those of the uncharged disc given in @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial test for all @xmath117 consists in checking the exact relation @xcite @xmath128 this relation is satisfied by our results for all eight available orders in @xmath56 .",
    "shows the coordinate independent surface mass density @xmath129 normalized by the angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the normalization by @xmath63 in , this gives a plot regular at @xmath60 .",
    "the already known shift of the maximum of @xmath130 out of the disc centre appears to weaken with growing charge .",
    "for @xmath131 the angular velocity @xmath4 vanishes and is hence no more an appropriate scaling parameter .",
    "another interesting quantity is the disc radius @xmath63 , normalized by the baryonic mass @xmath132 which is depicted in .",
    "the small values at @xmath60 and the weak dependence on @xmath117 indicate a transition to a black hole as in the limiting cases @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "note that one has to distinguish the external perspective ( finite @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) from the internal perspective ( finite @xmath137 , @xmath138 ) in the limit @xmath60 , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the quantity @xmath139 for @xmath60 can be interpreted as the contraction of a disc with given baryonic mass to the origin of the @xmath140-coordinate system in the extreme relativistic limit .",
    "this strongly indicates the occurrence of a singularity in that limiting case . to check whether this singularity is indeed related to an extreme kerr - newman black hole , three other ,",
    "more specific tests are carried out .",
    "for the extreme kerr - newman metric , the following relation holds on the horizon @xmath141 ( located at @xmath142 ) : @xmath143^{-1}.\\ ] ] the corresponding @xmath117-dependence of @xmath144 computed out of @xmath145 via @xmath146 is depicted in as the red line .",
    "if we transform to normalized coordinates by @xmath147 ( keep in mind that we expect @xmath148 for @xmath60 ) , the extreme relativistic limit yields the limiting spacetime from the internal perspective .",
    "the relation @xmath149 on the whole disc is strongly conjectured to be necessary and sufficient for obtaining the extreme kerr - newman metric as the external solution ( i.e.  for @xmath150 ) , provided @xmath148 as @xmath60 .",
    "the curves of @xmath151 and @xmath152 are depicted in in blue and green .",
    "the similarity of the three curves shows that @xmath153 is indeed in good approximation independent of @xmath154 and that its value meets the one given by .",
    "furthermore the extreme kerr - newman black hole obeys the 2 parameter relations @xmath155 with @xmath4 meaning the angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "the first of these quotients , calculated out of the disc quantities , is shown in .",
    "for the generic disc @xmath156 is greater than 1 as expected , whereas in the extreme relativistic limit @xmath156 converges to unity for growing expansion order @xmath157 .",
    "the last statement also holds for the second quotient @xmath158 shown in .     in the limit @xmath60 for different expansion orders @xmath157 . ]",
    "therefore we conclude that we have found strong evidence for the transition of the charged disc to an extreme kerr - newman black hole in the limit @xmath159 .",
