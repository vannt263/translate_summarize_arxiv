    "layered transition metal dichalcogenides ( ltmds ) have attracted intensive attentions in recent years due to their intrinsic non - zero bandgap , which gives them a superior advantage over graphene for use in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications such as field - effect transistors and electroluminescent devices @xcite .",
    "this class of layered materials with chemical composition of mx@xmath0 , where m and x correspond to the transition metal and the chalcogen elements , respectively , crystallizes in a hexagonal structure like graphene in which the m - atom layer is covalently bonded and sandwiched between the two x - atom layers . among ltmd materials , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers with a direct bandgap configuration",
    "have been extensively investigated because of many intriguing physical and chemical properties @xcite .",
    "these compounds can be synthesized through various methods , such as mechanical exfoliation @xcite , chemical vapor deposition @xcite , and intercalation techniques @xcite .",
    "in addition , they have quite similar lattice constants which also enable the synthesis of mos@xmath0-ws@xmath0 heterostructures with minimum interfacial defects @xcite .",
    "point defects such as atomic vacancies may cause a large variation in the electronic and optical properties of ltmds .",
    "vacancy defects , which can be created by thermal annealing and @xmath4 particles @xcite or electron beam irradiation @xcite , form localized trap states in the bandgap region , leading to light emission at energies lower than the interband optical transition energy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed charge mobility in single - layer mos@xmath0 is surprisingly low compared to bulk sample @xcite , indicating that the charge carrier scattering by structural defects , such as vacancies and grain boundaries , may be a primary source for such a low mobility @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have studied point defects and their concentrations for several samples of mos@xmath0 by means of different preparation methods .",
    "they found that the dominant type of point defects in each sample is strongly dependent on the chosen sample preparation method . nevertheless , the sulphur vacancy is the predominant point defect compared to mo vacancy , regardless of the type of preparation method .",
    "@xcite    the effects of point defects on the electronic structure of ltmds have also been theoretically studied by several groups using first principles calculations @xcite and 6-band tight - binding ( tb ) model @xcite .",
    "although , _ ab initio _ methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) can achieve a good degree of accuracy to describe the electronic structure of pristine ltmd materials , they are limited in their application by the presence of defects in the samples .",
    "for instance , simulation of vacancy - doped mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers with a random distribution of vacancies requires a very large supercell in the calculations which is computationally expensive for dft methods . with tb approach which is a simpler and less computationally demanding method , however , it is possible to deal with such large systems .",
    "the use of large supercells within tb model makes it also possible to eliminate the vacancy - vacancy interactions from the calculations .",
    "after the two - band @xmath5 model describing the conduction and valence bands around the two valleys ( k and k@xmath6 points ) in the hexagonal brillouin zone of ltmd @xcite , several tb models in various approximations have been proposed to reproduce the first - principles band structure of pristine ltmd @xcite . among them , the tb model of zahid _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , including nonorthogonal @xmath1 orbitals of m and x atoms and spin - orbit coupling , is able to accurately reproduce the first - principles bands for a wide range of energies in the brillouin zone .",
    "the model considers nearest - neighbor slater - koster hopping matrix elements of m - m , m - x , and x - x , which can be applied to monolayers , bilayers and bulk mx@xmath0 @xcite .    in this work , based on the parameterized tb model of zahid _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we explore the influence of vacancy defects on the electric properties of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers to see how the missing atoms at different concentrations evolve the intrinsic bandgap and electronic states of the monolayers .",
    "since the model presents an accurate description for the band structure of ltmds , the application of this model to defective mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 provides a more realistic understanding of the electronic states contributing to the process of vacancy formation and the accurate location of defect states within the bandgap .",
    "moreover , the optimized geometries of the monolayers obtained by _ ab initio _ calculations have demonstrated that atomic vacancies do not cause a considerable geometry deformation and the neighboring atoms around the vacancies do not show any visible displacement @xcite .",
    "therefore , the defect - induced deformation is ignored .",
    "we show that the vacancy defects mainly induce localized states within the bandgap of pristine mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , leading to a shift of the fermi level toward valance or conduction band , depending on the type of vacancy .",
    "the rest of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our model and formalism for calculation of band structure and electronic states of the defective monolayers .",

    "the band structure of defective mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 is carried out within the non - orthogonal slater - koster scheme @xcite . from dft calculations",
    "@xcite , we know that the bands of both structures are made up of the @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 valence orbitals of mo , w , and s atoms . therefore , a basis set consisting of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 orbitals is used as a starting point for constructing the tb hamiltonian .",
    "this means that for a monolayer mx@xmath0 with one m atom and two x atoms per unit cell , we should consider a 27-band tb spinless model .",
    "moreover , a bloch sum is taken into account for each atomic orbital on each atomic site in the unit cell due to the periodicity of the monolayer .",
    "on the other hand , in order to model a defective mx@xmath0 monolayer with different vacancy concentrations the system is partitioned into @xmath18 supercells each containing @xmath19 unit cells where @xmath20 is an integer number . figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) show such a monolayer with 3@xmath73 supercells each containing a single vacancy defect .",
    "since all the valence orbitals of the atoms belonging to the supercell are included in the atomic orbitals basis set , the number of bands increases with the size of the supercell .",
    "the total hamiltonian of mx@xmath0 monolayer can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the slater - koster tight - binding hamiltonian for non - orthogonal @xmath1 orbitals , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 identity matrix , and @xmath25 is an atomiclike spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath22 has the same form for both spin - up and spin - down states and can be expressed in the real space as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the creation operator for an electron in an atomic valence orbital @xmath4 at @xmath28-th atom , @xmath29 , with on - site energy @xmath30 .",

    "can be non - zero .",
    "therefore , the band structure of the system is calculated by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the eigenvector of the band @xmath4 and @xmath54 is an allowed wave vector in the two - dimensional brillouin zone , shown in fig .",
    "note that the size of hamiltonian @xmath55 and overlap , @xmath56 , matrices ( including spin ) , which is the same as the size of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the real space , is equal to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of basis orbitals per supercell and 2 is for spin . in the absence of vacancy defects , the size of these matrices , including the spin - orbit interaction for a monolayer with @xmath61 supercells , is @xmath62 . to introduce a single vacancy defect",
    ", we remove one atom from the supercell while the symmetry of the lattice remains intact @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of atomic orbitals in each supercell and hence the size of matrices .",

    "we now use the method described above to study the influence of single vacancy defects on electronic properties of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers .",
    "first , we discuss the tb band structure and partial dos of the pristine monolayers in the presence of spin - orbit interaction and their consistency with dft calculations .",
    "it should be mentioned that for more quantitative agreement between our tb results and fully - relativistic ab - initio dft calculations @xcite , we include the spin - orbit coupling between mo @xmath2 orbitals , instead of @xmath3 orbitals and only between w @xmath2 orbitals , instead of @xmath3 and @xmath2 orbitals used in ref . .",
    "the fitted spin - orbit parameters , the valence - band spin - splitting values , and the band gaps obtained in this way are presented in table i. the bandgap values of 1.80 ev for mos@xmath0 and 1.98 ev for ws@xmath0 and the valence band spin - orbit splittings , obtained using this method , are in good agreement with dft @xcite and experimental values @xcite .",
    "note that the single - layer ws@xmath0 has a larger bandgap because the crystal field splitting of the metal @xmath2 states , which is larger in w compared to mo , is responsible for a large part of the bandgap @xcite .",
    "in addition , the valence band spin - splitting in ws@xmath0 is almost three times larger than that in mos@xmath0 , which makes the observation of valley and spin hall effect easier in ws@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "we see that both monolayers have a direct bandgap at the two inequivalent corners k and k@xmath6 of the brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "the spin splittings in the band structures along @xmath75-k - m and @xmath75-k@xmath6-m lines are opposite which lead to valley - selective optical absorption and may cause optically induced valley and spin hall effects @xcite . comparing the band structures with that given in refs .",
    ", , and clearly shows the quantitative agreement between tb and dft results ( see hollow circles in fig .",
    "2 ) . from the partial dos of pristine monolayers",
    "one can see the contribution of each type of atomic orbitals to the formation of energy bands .",
    "the conduction - band minimum ( cbm ) and the vbm of mos@xmath0 ( ws@xmath0 ) are mostly dominated by mo ( w ) @xmath2 orbitals and s @xmath3 orbitals , in agreement with dft @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of s @xmath76 orbitals in our model leads to a nonzero contribution to the electronic states which is comparable to s @xmath77 orbitals in the conduction band .    to study atomic vacancy defects ,",
    "the monolayer is partitioned into supercells and one atom from each supercell is removed without any change in the symmetry of the lattice ( see fig .",
    "we have examined several supercell sizes ( 3@xmath73 , 4@xmath74 and 5@xmath75 ) to reveal the strength of vacancy - vacancy interaction on the localized midgap states .",
    "note that in the supercell calculations , as the supercell grows in size , the corresponding brillouin zone in the @xmath54-space shrinks and the bands in the original ( normal ) brillouin zone get folded into the supercell brillouin zone .",
    "in other words , if the supercell is @xmath20 times larger than the normal cell , the brilouin zone of the supercell will be @xmath20 times smaller and will contain @xmath20 times more bands .",
    "now , let us consider metal vacancies at different concentrations in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the band structure and the corresponding partial dos of mos@xmath0 when a mo vacancy is introduced .",
    "since each supercell contains only one atomic vacancy defect , the size of supercell manifests itself as a measure of defect concentration .",
    "accordingly , the mo defect concentration per supercell in fig .",
    "3(a)-3(c ) is @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the defect concentrations represent the ratio of number of vacancies to the number of atomic sites per supercell which correspond to vacancy densities of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "we see that at high vacancy concentration , i.e. , @xmath78 , the defect states form a band in the middle of the gap , whose width is @xmath85 0.73 ev ( see fig .",
    "the midgap band creates defect states with three peaks in the dos spectrum arising from neighboring mo @xmath86 orbitals and s @xmath77 and @xmath76 orbitals around the defect .",
    "in addition , the vacancy defect induces a sharp peak at the top of the valence band ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , corresponding to s @xmath77 orbitals , which shifts toward lower energies as the concentration decreases .",
    "the midgap band splits into two bands centered around fermi level of pristine mos@xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "these bands become more localized at concentration @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) indicating that gap states generated by mo vacancies are mainly localized around atomic defects , in agreement with ref . .",
    "it is important to point out that the position of fermi energy is determined by counting the number of electrons that the atoms in the supercell provide .",
    "these electrons fill up the lowest energy bands and hence , the fermi level lies between the highest occupied band and the lowest unoccupied band .",
    "monolayer with ( a ) 3@xmath73 , ( b ) 4@xmath74 , and ( c ) 5@xmath75 supercells each containing a single mo vacancy .",
    "the intersection of white and yellow regions shows the fermi energy . ]",
    "we now consider the effect of metal vacancies on electronic structure of ws@xmath0 monolayer at different defect concentrations , as shown in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(c ) .",
    "the band structure of fig .",
    "4(a ) shows two midgap bands in their close proximity , located below the fermi energy of the pristine monolayer .",
    "these bands form a single narrow band with three peaks in the partial dos , associated with localized states around the defects as the concentration decreases ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) ) .",
    "we see that the midgap states originate mainly from w @xmath87 orbitals and s @xmath77 and @xmath76 orbitals , indicating that the contribution of s @xmath76 orbitals could be considerable in the electronic structure of ltmd when metal vacancies are introduced in the system .",
    "moreover , contrary to the electronic structure of defective mos@xmath0 with mo vacancies , the induced sharp peak at the top of the valence band , corresponding to the s @xmath77 orbitals , is not shifted down in energy as the distance between point defects in ws@xmath0 monolayer increases .",
    "this reveals a strong hybridization between sulphur atoms , and hence , localization of s @xmath77 states around w defects .",
    "monolayer with ( a ) 3@xmath73 , ( b ) 4@xmath74 , and ( c ) 5@xmath75 supercells each containing a single w vacancy .",
    "the intersection of white and yellow regions shows the fermi energy . ]",
    "comparing fig .",
    "3 with fig .",
    "4 , we find that the fermi energy in both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers is shifted down in energy by the presence of metal vacancies .",
    "this suggests that the mo / w point defects can make the system a p - type semiconductor , in agreement with dft results @xcite .",
    "moreover , the defect states of ws@xmath0 are closer to vbm than that of mos@xmath0 monolayer , indicating that the ws@xmath0 monolayer may act as a more efficient p - type semiconductor than mos@xmath0 , when the metal vacancies are induced .",
    "monolayer with ( a ) 3@xmath73 , ( b ) 4@xmath74 , and ( c ) 5@xmath75 supercells each containing a single s vacancy .",
    "the intersection of white and yellow regions shows the fermi energy . ]",
    "let us study the influence of chalcogen defect on the electronic structure of the monolayers . figs .",
    "5 and 6 show the band structures and the partial dos of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers , respectively , when a single sulphur vacancy ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) is created per supercell . from fig .",
    "5(a ) it is evident that at high defect concentration , the sulphur vacancies induce a midgap band with bandwidth @xmath88 ev in the vicinity of the vbm , indicating that the defect states tend to be more delocalized due to the interaction between s vacancies .",
    "the midgap band manifests itself as defect states with three peaks in partial dos which become more localized as the concentration decreases ( figs .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) ) .",
    "in addition , there is a flat band just below the mos@xmath0 cbm which does not change notably with the concentration changes .",
    "the mo @xmath86 orbitals around the vacancies play the main role in creation of midgap states , while the s @xmath77 and @xmath76 orbitals do not contribute considerably to the defect states of gap region .",
    "the presence of sulphur vacancy shifts the fermi level to the bottom of the conduction band due to unsaturated electrons in the mo orbitals around the vacancy defect .",
    "this property suggests that sulphur vacancies can turn the mos@xmath0 monolayers into a n - type semiconductor in agreement with theory and experiment @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the electronic band structure of ws@xmath0 monolayer in the presence of sulphur vacancies with concentration @xmath78 shows a narrow band with bandwidth @xmath89 ev in the gap region ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) . in this case",
    "the contribution of w @xmath87 orbitals and s @xmath77 and @xmath76 orbitals in generation of midgap states are almost the same , as shown in the partial dos of fig .",
    "as the size of the supercell increases , the defect state in the bandgap becomes more localized around the vacancy region and the contribution of w @xmath87 states dominates in the localized state as can be seen in the dos of figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) .",
    "the defect state which acts as a donor level , lies about 0.6 ev below the cbm , in agreement with the dft result @xcite , indicating that at a high enough temperature some of the localized charges can be transferred to the cbm and therefore increase the system conductivity .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that the sulphur vacancies act as electron donors and make the both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers electron rich . besides the monosulphur vacancies , the effect of two neighboring sulphur ( disulphur ) vacancies on the same side of the monolayers , and also on different sides of the monolayer , but on top of each other per supercell on the electronic properties of the layers was also examined ( not shown here ) .",
    "our tb calculations showed an additional shift of fermi level toward conduction band with an increase in the number of localized states in the bandgap .",
    "the experimental observations have demonstrated that these disulphur vacancies are less probable to create , due to their formation energy which is roughly twice of that of the monosulphur defect @xcite .",
    "monolayer with ( a ) 3@xmath73 , ( b ) 4@xmath74 , and ( c ) 5@xmath75 supercells each containing a single s vacancy .",
    "the intersection of white and yellow regions shows the fermi energy . ]    comparing the localized donor states and the fermi energy in figs . 5 and 6 , it is clear that the n - type semiconducting behavior in mos@xmath0 is more dominant than that in ws@xmath0 , when the sulphur vacancies are introduced .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the recent experimental observation of electronic properties of mos@xmath0-ws@xmath0 heterostructures , indicating that both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 act as n - type semiconductors with relatively high fermi level in mos@xmath0 as compared to ws@xmath0 @xcite .    to show the advantage of our tight - binding method over first - principles calculations , we have also studied the vacancy defects in the 11@xmath711 supercells which correspond to vacancy concentration of @xmath90 @xmath84 . the electronic structure of both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers with such a low concentration of sulphur and metal defects",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "7 . due to this low density of defects ,",
    "the vacancy - vacancy interaction is quite negligible and hence the midgap states are strongly localized .",
    "comparing fig . 7 with figs . 3 - 6",
    ", we see that the p - type and n - type semiconducting behaviors in these defective monolayers are not affected by the value of defect concentration .",
    "therefore , it is evident that this size of supercell is computationally trivial for our tight - binding scheme , but extremely expensive for dft methods .",
    "it is important to point out that the calculation of spin - dependent density of states in the close proximity of sulphur and metal defects did not show any spin polarization , indicating that in the present approximation , the single s , mo , and w vacancies do not induce any magnetic moments .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the agreement between the results of our slater - koster tight - binding model and the first - principles calculations in predicting p - type and n - type semiconducting behaviors is related to the accuracy and reliability of fitted parameters which provide us a more accurate description of the band structures , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . accordingly",
    ", our method is not only able to clearly demonstrate the electronic band structure of defective mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 monolayers , but also is very computationally affordable and can be easily generalized to study very large systems with a random distribution of single defects and other types of vacancies such as mos double vacancies , mos@xmath0 triple vacancies and antisite defects @xcite .     and ws@xmath0 monolayers with 11@xmath711 supercells each containing a single atomic defect .",
