    "similarly , the superconducting transition temperature of the alkali - doped @xmath0 has been explained by the usual phonon mechanism @xcite .",

    "<S> a model study of the singlet excitons in the @xmath0 molecule with emphasis on the coulomb interaction between excited electron and hole leads to a physical understanding of the interaction effects on the absorption spectra and to a new identification of the forbidden excitons in the third - harmonic generation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions may be tested experimentally on the model predictions related to the optical kerr effect . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows that , with sufficiently strong interatomic than onsite interaction , a @xmath1 exciton could have very low energy or become unstable against the closed - shell ground state . </S>",
    "<S> properties of these interesting cases beyond the @xmath0 are briefly examined . </S>"
