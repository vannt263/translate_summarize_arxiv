    "the fundamental principles of physics , as we understand them today , emphasize the role of three constants : @xmath2 ( newton s gravitational constant ) , @xmath3 ( the speed of light ) and @xmath4 ( the planck constant ) . by a suitable choice of units , we can set the numerical value of all these three to unity and the broad structure of physical theories can be represented using a 3-dimensional space in which each of the cartesian coordinates is taken to be one of the above mentioned fundamental constants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : physicscube ] ) .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to use @xmath5 rather than @xmath3 in such a description , and the entire space of physical theories will be confined within the unit cube so formed .",
    "the examination of this diagram reveals several interesting features .",
    "the origin @xmath6 represents an idealized non - relativistic ( point ) mechanics ( nrm ) with which many physics courses begin . moving along the speed of light axis to @xmath7 , ( keeping @xmath8 ) , will get us special relativistic ( sr ) mechanics .",
    "similarly , moving along the @xmath9axis will lead to non - relativistic , classical , newtonian gravity ( ng ) and travelling along the @xmath10axis will lead to non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "more exact theoretical structures emerge when a _",
    "pair _ of constants are non - zero .",
    "the vertex @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 represents classical general relativity ( gr ) which combines the principles of special relativity and gravity .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 , @xmath14 leads to flat spacetime quantum field theory ( qft ) which combines the principles of special relativity and quantum theory .",
    "the vertex at which all the three constants are unity , @xmath15 , should represent the domain of quantum gravity but , more importantly for our purpose , _ it also represents the study of quantum field theory in curved space - time _",
    "( qft in cst ) , like , for example , the study of radiation from black holes .",
    "( a description of the thermal features of black holes requires all these three constants to be non - zero . )",
    "while quantum gravity still remains a distant dream , we do have a fair amount of understanding of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and , in this sense , this vertex ( qft in cst ) can be considered as within our grasp .    while most of these limiting forms of physical theories have attracted a reasonable amount of attention and made it into textbooks , the above diagram brings out one limiting case which probably has not been explored in comparable detail .",
    "this is the vertex with @xmath16 , which corresponds to exploring the nature of gravity in a quantum _ mechanical _ context ( gqm ) .",
    "much of the discussion in this paper is devoted to the exploration of this vertex and , more generally , to projecting the theories to the @xmath17 plane by taking the @xmath18 limit in different contexts .",
    "this vertex is of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , there are interesting questions related , for example , to the principle of equivalence and the free - fall of atomic systems in newtonian gravitational fields which are conceptually and experimentally important @xcite .",
    "this topic has received a fair amount of attention in the context of neutron interferometry @xcite as well as in the context of neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "there are some controversies ( and possible lack of clarity ) in the literature on this topic , which makes it worth studying .",
    "second , this vertex serves as an interesting test - bed for several limiting processes . for example , note that one can arrive at the gqm vertex from the quantum field theory in curved spacetime ( qft in cst ) vertex by taking the limit @xmath18 .",
    "it will be interesting to ask what limiting forms the known results in quantum field theory in curved spacetime take when we project ( move ) along this direction and do a taylor series expansion in inverse powers of @xmath3 .",
    "( for example , it would be interesting to ask what is the lowest non - trivial order in @xmath19 one should work at to reproduce , say , the thermal nature of the inertial vacuum . )    third , this limit also has interesting implications even in the context of @xmath14 , viz .",
    ", when we move from quantum field theory to quantum mechanics .",
    "how does quantum _ field _ theory reduce to _ single particle _",
    "quantum mechanics when we take the @xmath18 limit , and how does this limiting process get modified when we `` switch on '' @xmath2 ?",
    "we will see that there are some subtleties even in the simplest context of transition from special relativity to non - relativistic mechanics because the symmetry groups  the lorentz group and the galilean group  have very different structures @xcite .    finally , it is interesting to investigate the role of the principle of equivalence in quantum mechanical and field theoretic phenomena .",
    "( this issue has attracted attention in many of the papers quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "we know that one can mimic the local effects of gravity by a coordinate transformation to a suitable non - inertial frame .",
    "therefore , a corresponding transformation to a non - inertial frame in quantum mechanics must allow us to incorporate the effects of gravity and take us from the qm to the gqm vertex .",
    "it is interesting to verify this explicitly and understand the details .",
    "the key new results in our paper are the following :    \\(i ) we show that the reason for the non - invariance of the galilean action under galilean transformations is intimately connected to the existence of _ rest - mass energy of the particle which leaves a residue even in the non - relativistic limit_. the details of the calculation might help to clarify some controversial conclusions in the literature @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) we point out that the special relativistic action is invariant under a lorentz transformation _ even if we ignore terms of order @xmath20 and beyond _ , and discuss the consequences of this result , which does not seem to have been noticed previously in the literature .",
    "\\(iii ) we show that the principle of equivalence does hold good in quantum mechanics , _ if _ it is interpreted as embodying the equivalence of the _ dynamical equations _ in an accelerated frame and in a gravitational field .",
    "we explicitly prove this equivalence for the case of the schrodinger equation in an inertial and an accelerated frame of reference .",
    "\\(iv ) we show that the relativistic feynman propagator in quantum field theory can be obtained from a path integral over @xmath21 , just as in the case of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , but now with the standard special relativistic action @xmath22 _ which is not quadratic_. we also show explicitly _ how _ the feynman propagator reduces to the feynman path - integral kernel in the non - relativistic limit , not only in the inertial frame , but also in the rindler frame , and in the more general context of a weak gravitational field .",
    "this procedure also allows us to obtain the leading relativistic _",
    "correction _ to the feynman path - integral .",
    "\\(v ) we show that the reason for the _ non - transitivity _ property of the feynman propagator is the same as that for the non - transitivity of the corresponding _ energy kernel _ in the non - relativistic theory , and we elaborate and discuss this connection .    throughout the paper , we have tried to be as self - contained as possible by giving the necessary pedagogical details .",
    "we begin by discussing the  apparently elementary  situation of the transition from special relativity to non - relativistic mechanics ( nrm ) by taking the limit @xmath23 which involves moving along sr to nrm in fig .",
    "[ fig : physicscube ] .",
    "while text books consider this limiting procedure as straightforward , we will see that some curious features arise when we consider the limiting form of the action functional in this context .",
    "( not surprisingly , this issue has led to some controversial conclusions in published literature @xcite which we also hope to clarify . ) as is well known , special relativity is invariant under a lorentz transformation of the coordinates , while non - relativistic mechanics is invariant under a galilean transformation of the coordinates .",
    "given the fact that one recovers the galilean coordinate transformation by setting @xmath24 in the lorentz transformation equations , one would have thought that any theory which is lorentz invariant will lead to a theory which is invariant under galilean transformations in the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "as we shall see , there are several subtleties in the manner by which galilean invariance of the theory arises in this limit from lorentz invariance .",
    "this topic is usually discussed in the literature in relation to the structure of the galilean group and superselection rules in quantum mechanics ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall explore the issues in a more straightforward and transparent manner .",
    "we begin by enquiring how the action functional for a free particle changes under lorentz transformations in special relativity and galilean transformations in non - relativistic mechanics .",
    "we note that the action @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where the lagrangian @xmath27 can be expressed as a function @xmath28 of the square of the magnitude of the particle s velocity , by taking into account the homogeneity of space and time and the isotropy of space .",
    "this holds both in the case of relativistic and non - relativistic mechanics .",
    "it is impossible to proceed further and determine the explicit form of the lagrangian , without making some additional assumptions .",
    "we now have to make a distinction between non - relativistic and relativistic mechanics by postulating the invariance of physical laws under different sets of coordinate transformations .    in non - relativistic theory",
    ", we postulate that the equations of motion should retain the same form when we make a galilean transformation : @xmath29 from the co - ordinates @xmath30 of an inertial frame @xmath31 to the co - ordinates @xmath32 of another frame @xmath33 moving with a uniform velocity @xmath34 along the positive @xmath35direction with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "( in this and what follows , we suppress the two spatial dimensions and work in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions for simplicity . )",
    "the corresponding velocity transformation is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the velocities measured in frames @xmath31 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the sufficient ( though not necessary ) condition for the equations of motion to retain the same form in both @xmath31 and @xmath33 is that the action should be invariant under the transformations in .",
    "it is straight forward to see that _ no _ non - trivial function @xmath39 has this property and hence _ we fail to construct _ an action functional which remains invariant under the galilean transformation .",
    "the usual procedure at this stage is to note that the equations of motion will remain invariant even if the lagrangian is not , as long as the lagrangian changes only by the addition of a total time derivative of a function of coordinates and time .",
    "it is again easy to show that this requires the lagrangian for the free particle to be _ proportional _ to the square of the velocity i.e. @xmath40 or @xmath41 where @xmath42 is defined to be the mass of the particle . in this case , the lagrangians @xmath27 and @xmath43 in the frames of reference @xmath31 and @xmath33 respectively are related by : @xmath44 hence , in the non - relativistic theory , the lagrangians @xmath27 and @xmath43 differ by a total time derivative of a function of co - ordinates and time .",
    "the corresponding actions differ by contributions at the end points : @xmath45 note that the canonical momentum ( @xmath46 ) and the energy @xmath47 are _ not _ invariant when we transform from @xmath27 to @xmath43 .    in special relativity ,",
    "we replace by the lorentz transformations between @xmath31 and @xmath33 of the form : @xmath48 the transformation of velocities is now given by : @xmath49 in the limit of @xmath50 , the above equations reduce to the corresponding ones for the galilean transformation .",
    "curiously enough , it is now possible to construct an action functional which _ is actually invariant _ ( instead of picking up an extra boundary term ) under the transformations in .",
    "this is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant .",
    "the above form of the action remains invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "it is _ not _ possible to choose @xmath52 such that reduces to the action for non - relativistic mechanics when @xmath18 .",
    "the best we can do is to choose @xmath52 in such a way that in the non - relativistic limit , we get back the non - relativistic form of the action , _ apart from a constant term _ in the lagrangian",
    ". this amounts to setting @xmath53 .",
    "hence , in special relativity , the action for a free particle is taken to be : @xmath54 the above discussion raises a couple of questions which require investigation .",
    "first , we expect the non - relativistic theory to arise as a limiting case of the fully relativistic theory , in the limit of @xmath50 .",
    "it is true that the lorentz transformation equations reduce to the galilean transformation equations in the limit of @xmath50 .",
    "however , the special relativistic action does _ not _ reduce to the non - relativistic action in this limit , but instead picks up an extra term , @xmath55 evaluated at the end points . as we shall see , this term  which is usually ignored in textbooks as being due to `` just an addition of a constant to a lagrangian ''  has some interesting implications for the structure of special relativity and non - relativistic mechanics .",
    "this is already hinted at by the fact that the relativistic action in blows up in the limit of @xmath18 and does not have a valid limit in the strict mathematical sense .",
    "if one can `` renormalize '' this action by adding a term @xmath56 to , then @xmath57 will have a proper limit .",
    "but then , @xmath58 is _ not _ lorentz invariant , and hence this `` renormalization '' is not a valid procedure .",
    "we will see repeatedly that the term @xmath59 plays a crucial role in our discussions .",
    "second , we find that in the special relativistic theory , which is the more exact theory , the action remains invariant under special relativistic ( lorentz ) transformations . however , in the non - relativistic limit , the corresponding non - relativistic action does _ not _ remain invariant under the analogous non - relativistic ( galilean ) transformations , but again picks up some extra terms .",
    "this is surprising , when seen in the light of the galilean transformation being a limiting case of the lorentz transformation . on @xmath60 or @xmath61 but incorporated galilean invariance by allowing @xmath27 to pick up a total derivative .",
    "it is possible to do the converse .",
    "one can write down free particle lagrangians which are _ strictly invariant _ under galilean transformations but depend explicitly on @xmath61 and @xmath60 through a total time derivative .",
    "a simple example is @xmath62 which is _ invariant _ under a galilean transformation but depends on @xmath61 and @xmath60 through a total time derivative ; @xmath27 differs from @xmath63 by the total time derivative @xmath64 . ]    both the above issues are usually ignored by noting that the equations of motion do not change when a total time derivative of a function of coordinates and time is added to the lagrangian , and hence such action functionals are equivalent as far as physical phenomena are concerned .",
    "this is true in _ classical _ physics , but in _ quantum _ theory , the form of the action is closely related to the phase of the wave function .",
    "our analysis suggests that the phase of the wave function of a free particle remains invariant under lorentz transformations , but in the @xmath18 limit , this invariance gets broken .",
    "we will now explore this situation by studying the phase of the free particle wave function in relativistic quantum theory and its limiting form in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the key issue can be introduced by examining the following argument which seems to allow one to find the wave function of a _ moving _ free particle from that of a _ stationary _ free particle .",
    "the argument runs as follows : consider a particle of mass @xmath42 which is at rest in a frame @xmath33 that is moving with a velocity @xmath34 along the @xmath35axis of another inertial frame @xmath31 .",
    "we postulate that ( a ) the phase of the wave function in @xmath33 should depend on the rest energy @xmath65 in the usual manner and hence the wave function should be @xmath66 . if we also assume that ( b ) @xmath67 is a scalar under lorentz transformations , then the wave function in @xmath31 is given by @xmath68 \\propto \\exp[-iet+ipx ]   \\label{relpsi}\\ ] ] where the symbols have their usual meanings and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the relativistic energy and momentum of the particle in the frame @xmath31 in which it is moving with velocity @xmath34 .",
    "thus , given the postulates ( a ) and ( b ) mentioned above , we can determine the wave function of a moving particle from that of a particle at rest using the lorentz transformation .",
    ", but the key points mentioned here continue to hold even when we take this fact into account .",
    "hence we will not worry about it in this section . ]",
    "if we now take the limit of @xmath18 , we find that @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ". hence the wave function of a non - relativistic particle seems to be given by @xmath73 \\exp[-i(1/2)mv^2t+imvx]\\ ] ] thus we seem to have obtained the correct solution to free particle schrodinger equation `` except for '' the phase term @xmath74 which has no interpretation in non - relativistic mechanics .",
    "again , strictly speaking , @xmath67 does not have a limit when @xmath18 .",
    "one needs to consider , instead , the quantity @xmath75 $ ] to get the correct limit , but , just as in the case of the action functional , this is not a valid prescription .",
    "the correct @xmath67 in a relativistic theory is indeed the one in and not the one with an @xmath76 term subtracted out from the phase .",
    "the situation becomes more curious when we realize that we _",
    "could not have done any of these _ using galilean transformations alone .",
    "that is , there is no way of obtaining the wave function of a moving particle from that of a stationary particle by the application of a galilean transformation . to begin with",
    ", the postulate ( a ) above has no meaning in non - relativistic quantum mechanics and so we can not write down a wave function with a time dependent phase in its rest frame . second , as we shall see , wave functions do not transform as `` scalars '' under galilean transformations .",
    "to get everything right , one has to add an extra phase , the origin of which we will now discuss .",
    "let us again start with the phase of a relativistic wave function @xmath77 .",
    "we know that under a lorentz transformation , this goes over to @xmath78 where @xmath79 ; @xmath80 . in this transformation",
    ", we treat @xmath81 as just two real numbers parameterizing the wave function , and are _ not _ assuming that they are components of a four - vector , etc .",
    "but once we have applied the lorentz transformation _ to the coordinates , _ we can interpret the coefficients of @xmath82 ( which are @xmath83 ) as the energy and momentum of the particle in @xmath33 , and this interpretation , as we know , is correct .",
    "none of this works with galilean transformations and non - relativistic quantum mechanics . under a galilean transformation ,",
    "the phase of the free particle wave function in non - relativistic quantum mechanics transforms as @xmath84 which does not allow us to read off the coefficients of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as the physical energy and momentum of the non - relativistic particle in @xmath33 .",
    "so , unlike in the relativistic case , we can not identify the correct energy and momentum from the phase of the wave function after a galilean transformation .",
    "we can , of course , introduce by hand the two parameters @xmath87 and re - express the right hand side of in terms of @xmath88 .",
    "the result is best presented in terms of the identity : @xmath89 so , if we express the phase in @xmath33 in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then the phase is not invariant and we need to add an extra phase in the right hand side of .",
    "this extra phase is essentially the difference between the two actions in .",
    "since the phases of wave functions are classical actions for a free particle , it is clear that the non - invariance of the action under galilean transformations reflects itself in the additional phase that arises in the wave function .",
    "these facts are also related to the contrasting behaviour of the klein - gordon equation and the schrodinger equation under lorentz transformations and galilean transformations , respectively . with future applications in mind",
    ", we will consider the transformation of the schrodinger equation under a more general co - ordinate transformation from a frame of reference @xmath92 to a frame @xmath93 where @xmath94 is some arbitrary function of time .",
    "( the galilean transformation is a special case when @xmath95 ; when @xmath94 is not a linear function of @xmath61 this represents a transformation to a non - inertial frame . )",
    "using the fact that @xmath96 , @xmath97 we can transform the free particle schrodinger equation @xmath98 into the @xmath99 coordinates and obtain @xmath100 ( we have set @xmath101 for convenience . ) in the case of the galilean transformation , we have @xmath95 , leading to @xmath102 obviously the free particle schrodinger equation is not form invariant under the galilean transformation if we consider @xmath103 to be a scalar  unlike the klein - gordon equation , which is form invariant , with the wave function remaining a scalar . it is the second term on the right hand side of which requires an extra phase to be added to the wave function for everything to be consistent .    once again",
    ", all this is closely related to the fact that the action in special relativity is invariant under lorentz transformations while the action in non - relativistic mechanics picks up an additional term under galilean transformations . to see this explicitly",
    ", we will again consider the behaviour of the _ action _ for a free particle under the transformation from a frame of reference @xmath92 to a frame @xmath93 as before , and relate it to the extra phase in the wave function explicitly .",
    "the lagrangian of the free particle in @xmath33 is given by @xmath104 which can be written in the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath27 is a new lagrangian : @xmath107 which is equivalent to @xmath43 as far as the equations of motion are concerned , since the total time derivative @xmath108 does not contribute to the equations of motion .",
    "this @xmath27 represents the lagrangian for a particle acted upon by a force @xmath109 or , equivalently , a particle located in a spatially homogeneous but time dependent gravitational field @xmath110 .",
    "( in fact , the entire phase @xmath111 acquires a simple physical meaning when we take gravitational time dilation into account ; we will say more about this in section [ sec : qmequivalence ] . )",
    "we recall that when we add @xmath112 , to the lagrangian @xmath27 , thus transforming it to @xmath113 , both the canonical momentum and the hamiltonian change , becoming @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively . in quantum mechanics , the time evolution of the wave function",
    "is determined by the hamiltonian operator and hence , the form of the wave function must change when we make a co - ordinate transformation from the frame @xmath31 to the frame @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath116 be the quantum - mechanical wave function for the free particle in the frame @xmath33 .",
    "then , it can be shown that the corresponding wave function @xmath117 for the same particle in the frame @xmath31 is given by : @xmath118 and it satisfies the equation @xmath119 in the frame of reference @xmath31 , which is just the schrodinger equation with a `` pseudo - potential '' energy term , @xmath120 .",
    "this term arises because the frame @xmath31 is an accelerated frame of reference and has a close link with the principle of equivalence , which we shall take up later on in section [ sec : qmequivalence ] .",
    "( this result has been derived numerous times in the literature ; for completeness we reproduce the derivation in appendix [ app2 ] ) .    coming back to the case of galilean transformation , we have @xmath95 and @xmath121 therefore , takes the form @xmath122\\ ] ] that is",
    ", we need to transform the wave function , treating it as a scalar , _ and then add an extra phase _ which is consistent with what we found in . as we have said before , all this is perfectly consistent as regards the application of the galilean transformation in quantum mechanics .",
    "how is it that the klein - gordon equation is invariant under the lorentz transformation , but the schrodinger equation  which is presumably obtained in the @xmath18 limit of the klein - gordon equation  is _ not _ invariant under the galilean transformation , given the fact that the lorentz transformation reduces to the galilean transformation in the appropriate limit ?",
    "this has to do with the manner in which one obtains the schrodinger equation from the klein - gordon equation and brings to the center stage the role of the @xmath123 term in the phase .",

    "it has a simple interpretation as being equal to @xmath132 , thus emphasizing the role of rest energy _ even in the non - relativistic limit_. we will see later that this interpretation holds even in the presence of gravity , if we take the gravitational time dilation effect into account .",
    "there is another peculiar result closely related to the one obtained above which deserves mention .",
    "we have already seen that the action for a relativistic particle is invariant under the lorentz transformation while the action for the non - relativistic particle is not invariant under the galilean transformation .",
    "but it turns out  somewhat surprisingly  that the action for the relativistic particle remains invariant even if we only retain the terms in the action upto and including @xmath0 ( and ignore terms of @xmath134 and higher ) and also treat the lorentz transformation to the same order of approximation .",
    "this may be seen as follows : in the expression for the relativistic action for a free particle , we expand the integrand in a power series retaining terms upto and including order @xmath135 , and ignoring all higher order terms .",
    "we then find : @xmath136 however , to the same order of approximation , we also know that : @xmath137 hence we find that @xmath25 and @xmath138 are identical in form , even to this order in @xmath5 !",

    "but we have proved that the action for a non - relativistic particle is _ not _ invariant under a galilean transformation , but picks up an extra term .",

    "if we take into account the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath85 , even to the lowest order in @xmath142 , it will lead to invariance of the non - relativistic action functional .",

    "this result , which is surprising at first sight , arises from the fact that the difference between the coordinate time and the proper time carried by a moving clock is given by @xmath145 where the last equality holds to @xmath134 .",

    "our analysis shows that this is not the case and that such a result is indeed _ expected _ when the galilean transformation is used correctly in quantum mechanics . the real surprise  for which we have no simple explanation  is the result that the relativistic action remains form invariant even when we work to the accuracy of @xmath134 .",
    "the above result , as well as the invariance of the truncated action in , rely crucially upon our retaining the @xmath123 term in all the expressions .",
    "in fact , if we define a non - relativistic energy as @xmath147 , then one can again show that the phase of the wave function given by ( @xmath148 ) transforms to ( @xmath149 ) under a lorentz transformation , if we again retain terms only to the accuracy of @xmath134 .",
    "we next take up issues which arise when we switch on @xmath2 and move from quantum mechanics towards gqm in fig .",
    "[ fig : physicscube ] .",
    "one of the key questions which has been debated extensively in the literature is the validity of the principle of equivalence in quantum mechanics @xcite . in newtonian gravity",
    ", the principle of equivalence can be introduced in many ways and it also leads to several different conclusions .",
    "we can not , _ a priori _ , expect all these descriptions of the principle of equivalence ( or the resulting conclusions ) to be equally applicable when we proceed from the vertex qm to gqm in fig .",
    "[ fig : physicscube ] .",
    "we provide a brief critique of this issue in this section , essentially arguing that much of the debate can be settled by using an appropriate definition of the principle of equivalence in the quantum mechanical domain .",
    "consider the following two versions of the principle of equivalence : ( a ) the dynamics of a system in a spatially homogeneous ( but possibly time dependent ) gravitational field @xmath150 is the same as the dynamics of the same system viewed in an accelerated frame with coordinates @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "( b ) the accelerations of different masses @xmath153 in a gravitational field are independent of the masses @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , any measurement based on the trajectories of a particle moving in a given gravitational field can not be used to determine its mass .",
    "it is obvious that the statement ( a ) implies statement ( b ) in non - relativistic mechanics ; we know that the acceleration @xmath155 produced in the non - inertial frame is just @xmath156 which is indeed independent of the mass of the particle . if the dynamics in the non - inertial frame is the same as that in a gravitational field , then we must have @xmath157 in the gravitational field implying statement ( b ) .",
    "further , newton s law tells us that @xmath158 implying equality of inertial and gravitational masses .",
    "( in this paper , the term ` gravitational mass ' refers to the _ passive gravitational mass _ of the object . ) obviously , a measurement of the trajectory of the particle can not be used to determine its mass .",
    "a moment of thought shows that the last statement requires qualification in quantum theory .",
    "we do not have trajectories in quantum theory but one assumes that operators like @xmath159 , etc . are observables in quantum mechanics .",
    "if so , one should be able to devise a suitable experiment which measures , say , the dispersion in the position : @xmath160 .",
    "this quantity certainly depends on the mass of the particle when the particle moves in a gravitational field or even if the particle is free .",
    "in fact , the case of the free particle drives home the point without clouding the issue by involving acceleration , gravity etc . the trajectory of a free particle in non - relativistic mechanics is certainly independent of its mass , and any observation related to the trajectory can not determine its mass . but consider two free particles having masses @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) with identical initially prepared states in which the wave functions are gaussian wave packets of mean zero and width @xmath164 .",
    "if we allow these wave packets to propagate in time , then the widths @xmath165 and @xmath166 of these wave packets at any later time @xmath167 will be given by : @xmath168 hence , the width of the wave packet at any later time depends on @xmath42 , the mass of the free particle . by measuring the width at a later time and knowing the initial width",
    ", we can deduce the mass of the particle .",
    "the same result holds for particles moving under a gravitational field ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , this can not be used to prove any violation of the principle of equivalence .",
    "note that the _ heisenberg equations of motion _ for the quantum mechanical particle are identical in structure to the classical equations of motion and read @xmath169 , and hence , are independent of mass .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion in particle position will depend on the mass , in general .",
    "this shows that all the consequences which we derive from a particular version of the principle of equivalence in the classical domain may not hold in the quantum domain .",
    "as another example illustrating the same result , consider the context of the gravitational hydrogen atom , with the coulomb force between the proton and the electron being replaced by the gravitational force between two particles of masses @xmath42 and @xmath170 respectively , with @xmath42 orbiting around @xmath170 and @xmath171 . for this system ,",
    "the energy levels are given by : @xmath172 we see that the frequency of transition from one energy state to another will also be proportional to @xmath173 , and hence will depend on the mass of the orbiting particle .",
    "thus , in principle , this frequency can be used to determine @xmath42 .",
    "more generally , we can use the frequency of transitions between successive energy levels of a system composed of a massive particle orbiting around a `` nucleus '' , to determine the mass of the orbiting particle .",
    "this is clearly impossible in the classical theory .",
    "again , this experimental determination of mass should not be taken as a violation of the principle of equivalence . to see what is involved ,",
    "let us consider another example consisting of a particle of mass @xmath42 , moving under the action of a potential : @xmath174 this represents a `` non - hookean '' spring when @xmath175 .",
    "we will now choose the spring constant @xmath52 such that it is proportional to the mass of the particle : @xmath176 .",
    "classically , the mass @xmath42 cancels out of the equations of motion , @xmath177 , showing that the acceleration is independent of the mass of the particle .",
    "( more elaborately , one can consider several masses @xmath178 , each moving under a separate potential with the same @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so that each potential scales with the corresponding mass . )",
    "once again , classically , we can not determine the mass by observations of the trajectory .",
    "the situation is different in quantum mechanics .",
    "we can evaluate the energy levels of this `` oscillator '' in the wkb approximation using the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the quantum number corresponding to the energy level @xmath183 , and is assumed to be large compared to unity . using this integral",
    "we can determine the scaling of @xmath183 with @xmath182 and @xmath42 for different values of the exponent @xmath179 .",
    "we find ( appendix [ app3 ] ) that : @xmath184 when @xmath185 , @xmath186 which is the case of the harmonic oscillator ; in this case , @xmath183 is also independent of the mass @xmath42 .",
    "however , when @xmath175 the energy levels @xmath183 and hence the spacing between energy levels depend on @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we can use quantum mechanical transitions between successive energy levels of any of these oscillators to determine their mass @xmath42 !",
    "clearly , quantum mechanics allows such a determination which is not possible in classical theory based on measurements related to the trajectory of a particle . as the above example shows , this fact has nothing to do with gravity _ per se _ and is a general phenomenon .",
    "( in fact , even in classical mechanics , if one measures dynamical variables like momentum , energy etc . , one can certainly determine the mass of a free particle . )",
    "we believe that issues related to the determination of the inertial mass of a particle by quantum mechanical observations are red herrings to the proper formulation of the principle of equivalence in quantum mechanics . such a formulation can be based on the statement ( a ) in the beginning of the last section which embodies the mathematical equivalence of dynamical equations in an accelerated frame and in a gravitational field . given the schrodinger equation for a free particle in one frame of reference , if we transform it to any other arbitrarily accelerated frame of reference , we should obtain an equation identical in form to the schrodinger equation for a particle in the presence of an appropriate , in general time - dependent , _",

    "we have already demonstrated this result earlier in .",
    "the only new feature is that the wave functions in the two frames are not related by a scalar transformation , but require an additional phase factor to be added .",
    "this phase factor , as we demonstrated , was required for consistency under galilean transformations , but the situation is less clear for the case of an accelerated transformation . in what follows , we shall investigate this result in greater detail from different perspectives .",
    "in section [ subsec : lorgal ] , we showed that while the phase of the free particle klein - gordon equation is lorentz invariant , the corresponding phase of the schrodinger wave function is not invariant under a galilean transformation .",
    "we also demonstrated that the transformation to an accelerated frame in the non - relativistic context leads to the schrodinger equation with a gravitational potential .",
    "however , to obtain this result , we needed to explicitly include a phase in the wave function in .",
    "the question arises as to how we can understand this phase in a general context when we are no longer dealing with the lorentz transformation , and the galilean transformation as its limiting form , but have to deal with non - inertial frames .",
    "it is important to obtain the result in directly from a fully generally covariant equation , just as we obtained the results for the galilean transformation by taking the appropriate limit of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "we shall now show how this can be done for a time dependent acceleration , which does not seem to have been discussed in the literature before .    in the relativistic case",

    "the mathematics is identical in both the cases @xcite . in the case involving a beam of light ( of frequency @xmath321 ) traveling along the @xmath322axis from a slit located at @xmath323 , say , to a point on a screen with coordinates @xmath324 , with @xmath325 ( ` paraxial propagation ' ) , the relevant physics is contained in the phase difference acquired by the beam corresponding to a path difference @xmath326 : @xmath327^{1/2}-(z_2-z_1 ) \\right\\ } \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\frac{(\\mathbf{x}_2^\\perp-\\mathbf{x}_1^\\perp)^2}{2(z_2-z_1 ) } \\label{optics}\\ ] ] for a relativistic particle of mass @xmath42 , the corresponding phase is related to the proper time lapse @xmath328 and is given by : @xmath329^{1/2}-c(t_2-t_1 ) \\right\\ } \\label{relpart}\\ ] ] which reduces , in the @xmath1 limit ( which implies the paraxial propagation condition : @xmath330 along the time axis ) , to : @xmath331 which is precisely the phase of the quantum mechanical kernel for the nonrelativistic particle , arising again from the rest mass energy term in the appropriate limit .",
    "just as in paraxial optics we retain the propagation of light along the forward @xmath332 direction ( from slit to screen , say ) , ignoring backward propagation , in arriving at nonrelativistic quantum mechanics from field theory , we retain the propagation of the particle forward in the time axis , ignoring backward propagation . in both the contexts ,",
    "the approximation effectively reduces the degree of the relevant differential equation from two to one in the appropriate independent variable ( which is @xmath332 in optics and @xmath61 in quantum theory ) .",
    "that is , in arriving at non - relativistic quantum mechanics from quantum field theory , one considers paraxial propagation of the klein - gordon modes with the axis now being along the time direction .",
    "we have already seen in section [ sec : nringrav ] that , at the level of differential equations , the relevant limits work out correctly : the @xmath18 limit of the klein - gordon equation in a homogeneous , time dependent , gravitational field gives us the correct schrodinger equation .",
    "further , except for a phase whose origin we can understand , the same schrodinger equation is obtained in a non - inertial frame mimicking the same gravitational field .",
    "this establishes the principle of equivalence in the context of quantum mechanics at the level of the field equations .",
    "but , as mentioned earlier , there is a significant difference in the interpretation of the solutions of the klein - gordon and schrodinger equations in the two contexts .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether the formal equivalence of the two differential equations in the appropriate limit ensures the validity of the principle of equivalence . a more rigorous way of establishing this result would be to work at the level of propagators , and show that the feynman green s function in a non - inertial frame reduces in the @xmath1 limit to the non - relativistic kernel for the appropriate gravitational field .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath182 also works out correctly just as in the case of the free particle .",
    "hence , we have shown that the relativistic feynman propagator in the rindler frame reduces , in the appropriate limit , to the corresponding non - relativistic feynman path integral for the case of a particle moving with uniform acceleration .",

    "it is also interesting to notice that the kernel in , which contains the first - order relativistic correction to the non - relativistic path integral , does not possess the transitivity property due to the presence of additional terms in the integrand .",
    "the origin of this non - transitivity can be understood from the fact that , _ even in the non - relativistic case _ , the _ energy kernel _ is not transitive .",
    "this is to be expected purely from dimensional analysis and can be seen as follows .",

    "this paper highlights some features of the nonrelativistic limit which belong to the latter class .",
    "we saw that the behaviour of the action functional and the phase of the wave function in the nonrelativistic limit have no simple explanation within the nonrelativistic theory .",

    "<S> we discuss the non - relativistic limit of quantum field theory in an inertial frame , in the rindler frame and in the presence of a weak gravitational field , and attempt to highlight and clarify several subtleties . in particular , we study the following issues : ( a ) while the action for a _ relativistic _ </S>",
    "<S> free particle is invariant under the lorentz transformation , the corresponding action for a _ non - relativistic _ </S>",
    "<S> free particle is not invariant under the galilean transformation , but picks up extra contributions at the end points . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an extra phase in the non - relativistic wave function under a galilean transformation , which can be related to the rest energy of the particle _ even in the non - relativistic limit_. we show that this is closely related to the peculiar fact that the relativistic action for a free particle remains invariant even if we restrict ourselves to @xmath0 in implementing the lorentz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) we provide a brief critique of the principle of equivalence in the quantum mechanical context . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show how solutions to the generally covariant klein - gordon equation in a noninertial frame , which has a time - dependent acceleration , reduce to the non - relativistic wave function in the presence of an appropriate ( time - dependent ) gravitational field in the @xmath1 limit , and relate this fact to the validity of the principle of equivalence in a quantum mechanical context . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the extra phase acquired by the _ non - relativistic _ wave function in an accelerated frame , actually arises from the gravitational time dilation and survives in the non - relativistic limit . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) while the solution of the schrodinger equation can be given an interpretation as being the probability amplitude for a single particle , such an interpretation fails in quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show how , in spite of this , one can explicitly evaluate the path integral using the ( non - quadratic ) action for a relativistic particle ( involving a square root ) and obtain the feynman propagator . </S>",
    "<S> further , we describe how this propagator reduces to the standard path integral kernel in the non - relativistic limit . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) we show that the limiting procedures for the propagators mentioned above work correctly even in the presence of a weak gravitational field , or in the rindler frame , and discuss the implications for the principle of equivalence . </S>"
