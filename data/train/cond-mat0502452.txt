    "the search for novel quantum states in low - dimensional antiferromagnets ( af ) has triggered a significant activity in recent times @xcite .",
    "a remarkable amount of theoretical studies has concerned the phase diagram of antiferromagnets where long - range magnetic order is suppressed by enhanced quantum fluctuations .",
    "such a scenario can be established when the magnetic lattice dimensionality and the spin value are reduced or when the disorder is increased , either by means of heterovalent substitutions or by spin dilution @xcite .",
    "further enhancement of quantum fluctuations can occur when antiferromagnetic interactions are competing as , for instance , in frustrated two - dimensional @xmath15 heisenberg af ( 2dqhaf ) on a square - lattice , with nearest neighbour ( @xmath9 ) and next - nearest neighbour ( @xmath10 ) antiferromagnetic couplings of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "recently , a prototype of frustrated 2dqhaf on a square - lattice has been discovered , the li@xmath3vosio@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility , of the specific heat and of other quantities @xcite indicate that this compound is characterized by a ratio @xmath16 ranging from 1 to 4 @xcite .",
    "the ground state is collinear @xcite , as theoretically expected @xcite , and the staggered magnetization reaches a value @xmath17v@xmath11 @xcite , consistent with the @xmath16 estimate @xcite .",
    "this value is remarkably close to the one of a non - frustrated 2dqhaf @xcite and , therefore , at first sight one could think that , as far as @xmath16 is not close to @xmath18 and quantum fluctuations are not so strong , frustration does not affect sizeably the static magnetic properties of a 2dqhaf . in order to unravel the basic differences in the properties of frustrated and non - frustrated 2dqhaf",
    "it is tempting to compare also the behaviour of these systems when disorder is introduced , for example , by spin dilution .",
    "spin dilution has been widely investigated in prototypes of non - frustrated 2dqhaf , as la@xmath3cu@xmath4(zn , mg)@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite , and evidence for the validity of the simple dilution model with a renormalization of the spin stiffness and for the disappearance of long - range magnetic order at the classical percolation threshold has been given @xcite .",
    "at first , in a frustrated 2dqhaf on a square - lattice one would expect that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations leads to a suppression of the long - range order well below the percolation threshold .",
    "however , one should also consider that , owing to the next - nearest neighbours coupling , the percolation threshold extends to much larger doping levels with respect to non - frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "hence , it is not trivial to say a priori how the magnetic properties vary upon increasing the spin dilution .    in the following an experimental study of spin dilution effects in frustrated 2dqhaf on a square - lattice will be presented . in li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 spin dilution",
    "can be achieved upon ti@xmath11 ( @xmath19 ) for v@xmath11 ( @xmath15 ) substitution .",
    "it is found that spin dilution not only reduces the spin - stiffness by a factor @xmath12 , but also causes a reduction of the effective ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis of the sublattice magnetization curves shows that , at variance with non - frustrated 2dqhaf , spin dilution affects the low - temperature staggered magnetization only to a minor extent .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of the collinear ordering temperature and of other quantities will be discussed vis -  - vis with the trend observed for non - frustrated 2dqhaf . in the following section",
    "a description of the technical aspects involved in the sample preparation , magnetization , nmr and @xmath2sr measurements will be presented together with the experimental data .",
    "then the results will be discussed in the light of models which turned out to be valid for non - frustrated spin - diluted 2dqhaf .",
    "the final conclusions will be given in sect.iv .",
    "powder samples of li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 were prepared in a platinum crucible by solid state reaction starting from a stoichiometric mixture of li@xmath3sio@xmath20 ( aldrich , 99.5% ) , tio@xmath3 ( aldrich , 99.8% ) and vo@xmath3 at 830 c , under vacuum , for 24h @xcite .",
    "vo@xmath3 was prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of v@xmath3o@xmath21 and v@xmath3o@xmath20 by heating in a vacuum - sealed quartz tube at 650 c for 24h .",

    "co. ) under hydrogen at 800 c. the sample purity was analyzed by means of x - ray powder diffraction and all peaks corresponded to the ones of li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 .",
    "the lattice parameters of each sample were refined using the progamm celref .",
    "the substitution of ti for v leads to no significative variation of the cell parameters , which is consistent with the rather similar ionic radii of the two ions ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite ) . upon varying @xmath14 from 0 to 0.15",
    "the @xmath24 axes varies from 6.3683(4 )  to 6.3678(6 )  while the @xmath25 axes varies from 4.449(3 )  to 4.4502(4 )  .",
    "the homogeneity of ti concentration in the different samples was verified by edx ( energy dispersive x - ray analysis ) .",
    "magnetization measurements on li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 powders were performed using a quantum design xpms - xl7 squid magnetometer .",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibility , defined as @xmath26 is shown in fig.[figsquid ] .",
    "one observes a high temperature curie - weiss behaviour , a low - temperature maximum indicating the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations and a small kink in the 2 - 3 k range signaling a phase transition to a collinear ground - state . in the more doped sample , with 20% of ti",
    ", a low - temperature upturn is noticed .",
    "this upturn is typical of diluted 2dqhaf @xcite and originates from the correlated response of the spins around the @xmath19 impurity . above 20 k",
    "the data can be conveniently fitted according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is curie constant , @xmath29 the curie - weiss temperature and @xmath30 emu / mole @xcite the t - independent van - vleck susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the x - dependence of the curie - weiss temperature is shown in fig.2 , together with the x - dependence of the temperature @xmath31 at which @xmath32 displays a maximum and of the transition temperature @xmath33 to the collinear phase .",
    "this latter quantity was estimated from the peak in the derivative @xmath34 .",
    "one notices basically a monotonous decrease of all three quantities with increasing dilution , as expected .",
    "@xmath0li and @xmath1si nmr measurements have been carried out using standard radiofrequency pulse sequences . in particular ,",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath35 was estimated from the recovery of the nuclear magnetization after a saturating pulse sequence . since in the powder sample at low - t @xmath0li nmr line",
    "broadens due to the paramagnetic shift anisotropy , only a partial irradiation of the central and satellite lines is achieved .",
    "this causes a departure of the recovery law from a single exponential and hence at low temperature , below about 3 k , it is more appropriate to fit the recovery of the nuclear magnetization with a stretched exponential form , namely @xmath36 .",
    "the exponent @xmath37 decreased down to @xmath38 for @xmath39 k. on the other hand , the recovery law for @xmath1si was a single exponential over all the explored t - range .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath0li and @xmath1si @xmath35 derived from the fit of the recovery laws following the aforementioned procedure are shown in figs . 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "one notices that while @xmath0li @xmath35 displays a peak at @xmath33 , which broadens upon increasing @xmath14 , @xmath1si @xmath35 does nt show any peak and the relaxation rate is found to decrease on cooling .",
    "@xmath2sr measurements were performed on the emu instrument at the isis pulsed muon facility , using @xmath40 mev / c spin - polarized muons .",
    "li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 powders were pressed on a silver sample - holder , whose background contribution to the muon asymmetry was determined from the slowly decaying oscillating signal in a 100 gauss transverse magnetic field , below @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , below @xmath33 the external magnetic field sums up with the randomly oriented internal field @xmath41 and gives rise to a fast damping of the oscillating signal due to the muons stopping in the sample .",
    "the background was estimated @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "these values were kept fixed for all the subsequent fits .    by means of zero field ( zf ) muon spin relaxation measurements it is possible to extract the temperature dependence of the order parameter below @xmath33 , as previously done for the pure li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "below @xmath33 , superposed to an almost constant background , one observes a precessional signal at frequency @xmath46 ( fig.5 ) , with @xmath47 the muon gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath41 the local magnetic field at the muon generated by the collinear order . in a powder about 2/3 of the total signal oscillates while about 1/3 of the muons are in a longitudinal field configuration .",
    "hence , one can write for the decay of the muon asymmetry @xmath48 with @xmath49 the asymmetry of the oscillating component and @xmath50 the one of the longitudinal component .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 deviates from @xmath52 and is t - dependent since at a pulsed muon source the amplitude of the oscillating part is progressively filtered out as the precessional frequency increases .",
    "the reduction in @xmath49 on cooling is actually slightly more pronounced than what one would expect , taking into account that at isis the width of the muon pulse is about 70 ns .",
    "this suggests that a small part ( a fraction below 15% ) of the initial asymmetry is lost due to fast relaxing muons .",
    "this observation is supported by preliminary experiments performed at psi facility .",
    "there it was found that the asymmetry decay is characterized by a certain distribution of relaxation rates , typical of systems with impurities , and that a fraction of muons relax too fast to be detected at isis pulsed muon facility . in fig.[field ] the t - dependence of @xmath41 for @xmath43 is reported and compared to the one for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "one observes only a slight reduction of the saturation value of the local field at the muon and of @xmath33 , while the temperature dependence is unaffected .",
    "above @xmath33 the decay of the muon is conveniently described by a nearly static kubo - toyabe function . as in the pure compound",
    "the decay of the muon polarization can be conveniently fit using keren analytical approximation @xcite , which yields reliable results in the fast fluctuating limit , namely when @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the characteristic correlation time for the modulation of a magnetic field distribution of amplitude @xmath55 . at variance with li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 in the ti doped samples",
    "one finds that @xmath56 .",
    "however , keren approximation can still be used provided the fit is limited to a time @xmath57 @xcite . in fact",
    ", the data above @xmath33 were accurately fit up to @xmath58 @xmath59 with the function ( fig.5 ) @xmath60 where the first term describes the spin - lattice relaxation driven by the fast fluctuations , while the second one is keren analytical approximation of kubo - toyabe function . by fixing @xmath61 from the high longitudinal field measurements above @xmath62 gauss and fitting @xmath2sr data at different magnetic fields ,",
    "the t - dependence of @xmath54 was derived .",
    "it was found that @xmath54 , at variance with the pure compound where it diverges on cooling , is @xmath63independent and more than an order of magnitude larger ( fig.[tauc ] ) .",
    "in the weak doping limit , when the so called  dilution model \" should hold , the spin hamiltonian of a 2dqhaf with only n.n .",
    "interactions can be written in the form @xmath64 where the @xmath8 hamiltonian is modified simply by taking into account the probability @xmath65 to find a spin at site @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to a simple renormalization of the characteristic energy scales and the spin stiffness becomes @xcite @xmath67 .",
    "one can try to extend this result to frustrated 2dqhaf on a square lattice by considering that also a second - nearest neighbour coupling is present . on qualitative grounds",
    "one would expect that , since both the probability to find a pair of nearest - neighbour spins and of next - nearest - neighbours scale as @xmath68 , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 are renormalized by the same factor and hence , the effective degree of frustration @xmath16 is unaffected by dilution .",
    "moreover , the spin - stiffness is expected to scale as @xmath68 as for the non - frustrated system .",
    "it will be shown hereafter that although the spin - stiffness scales roughly as @xmath68 the experimental data evidence a modification of the effective @xmath16 ratio upon increasing @xmath14 .",
    "preliminary information on the effects of spin - dilution can be obtained from the analysis of the doping dependence of the transition temperature @xmath69 , which shows a different trend with respect to non - frustrated 2dqhaf . in fig.[fig:4 ] @xmath69 , extracted either from susceptibility data or from the peak in @xmath0li @xmath35 , is shown .",
    "the initial suppression rate of @xmath33 with ti doping @xmath70 , is not characterized by a @xmath28 value close to the one theoretically predicted and experimentally found for non - frustrated 2dqhaf , namely @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 @xmath69 is rather well described by the expression @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , namely by @xmath73 .",
    "this difference can be explained by resorting to the mean - field expression for @xmath69 @xcite    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the @xmath76 staggered magnetization , @xmath77 the in - plane correlation length in lattice units @xcite and @xmath78 the inter - layer coupling , which is reduced by a factor @xmath68 accounting for the probability to find two coupled spins in adjacent layers .    from this expression",
    "it is evident that the reduction of the staggered magnetization induced by dilution contributes to the reduction of @xmath69 .",
    "however , at variance with non - frustrated compounds , in which a spin dilution of 5% was found to reduce the zero temperature magnetization already by about 9 % @xcite , in li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 the same amount of doping reduces it only by @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ field ] ) .",
    "this explains why in li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 the effect of doping on @xmath69 is less pronounced .",
    "moreover , it is observed that if in eq.[castroneto ] one neglects the reduction of the staggered magnetization with doping and one considers that @xmath80 , one finds an initial suppression of @xmath69 characterized by a coefficient @xmath81 , exactly the one experimentally observed for li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 . in the lower part of fig.2",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of the spin - stiffness , estimated from eq.5 using the experimental values for @xmath69 and neglecting the reduction with @xmath14 of the staggered magnetization , is reported .",
    "it is observed that the spin - stiffness is reduced by a factor @xmath82 by spin dilution .",
    "a more accurate estimate of @xmath83 can be done taking into account the decrease of @xmath84 in eq.5 , derived from the reduction of the local field at the muon for @xmath85 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "one finds that @xmath86 .",
    "hence one concludes that the reduction of the spin - stiffness with @xmath14 is close to but not exactly the one that one would obtain by rescaling @xmath9 and @xmath10 by exactly the same factor @xmath68 .    in this respect",
    "it is interesting to analyze the effect of ti - doping on the effective ratio between the competing exchange couplings . a first evidence that @xmath13 is not @xmath87independent comes from the analysis of the susceptibility data ( see fig.[fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the ratio between @xmath88 and the curie - weiss temperature @xmath29 is a measure of the degree of frustration @xcite .",
    "in fact , while for @xmath89 this ratio is close to unity , on increasing @xmath10 it diminishes , reaching a minimum for @xmath90 and then increases again @xcite . in li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6",
    "this ratio is found to slightly decrease with @xmath14 from @xmath91 for @xmath8 to @xmath92 for @xmath45 . in principle",
    "it is difficult to extract precise values of @xmath16 from the above ratios , however , if one considers that for small changes @xmath16 varies linearly with @xmath93 , the observed modifications imply a reduction in @xmath16 by 15 - 20 % for @xmath45 .",
    "also the analysis of the temperature dependence of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath35 suggests that the effective ratio @xmath16 is affected by spin - dilution .",
    "@xmath35 can be written in terms of the components of the dynamical structure factor @xmath94 at the nuclear larmor frequency @xmath95 as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath98 is the form factor , which describes the hyperfine coupling of the spin excitations at wavevector * q * with the nuclei .",
    "in non - frustrated two - dimensional @xmath15 antiferromagnets it was pointed out that the in - plane correlation length can be conveniently derived from the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "in fact , by applying scaling arguments for the amplitude and frequency of the collective spin excitations at wavevector * q * , one can write the nmr relaxation rate in terms of the correlation length @xmath99 as @xcite    @xmath100    where @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the dynamical scaling exponent ( for @xmath103 @xmath104 @xcite ) , @xmath105 is a coefficient accounting for the reduction of the amplitude of spin excitations due to quantum fluctuations , @xmath106 is the heisenberg frequency @xcite , describing the uncorrelated spin fluctuation for @xmath107 and @xmath37 is a normalization factor which preserves the spin sum rule .",
    "the form factors have been calculated on the basis of the hyperfine constants determined for the pure li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 @xcite .    once @xmath102 is defined a one - to - one relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath99 is established , and one can determine @xmath99 from @xmath0li @xmath35 . then one can compare these results for @xmath99 with the recent theoretical predictions for the temperature dependence of @xmath99 , for different values of @xmath16 , based on the pure - quantum self - consistent harmonic approximation @xcite . in fig.[capriotti ]",
    "@xmath99 extracted from @xmath0li nmr relaxation data in li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 are reported both in the assumptions that @xmath109 or that @xmath110 .",
    "one observes that , above the crossover from 2d to 3d yielding the divergence of @xmath35 at @xmath33 , @xmath99 data derived for @xmath109 are in rather good agreement with the theoretical calculations for @xmath111 .",
    "larger ratios of @xmath16 and a dynamical scaling exponent @xmath110 do not appear to be consistent with the experimental findings .",
    "this suggests that the same scaling laws used for pure 2dqhaf could still be valid in the presence of frustration . for @xmath109 and @xmath112 ,",
    "if the form factor is weakly @xmath113-dependent as for @xmath0li in li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 , one has that @xcite @xmath114    then , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are reduced to the same extent by dilution and @xmath67 , the t - dependence of @xmath35 data should be @xmath14 independent once the temperature is rescaled to @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , in diluted non - frustrated 2dqhaf as la@xmath3cu@xmath4zn@xmath5o@xmath6 , such a scaling does occur ( see fig.[fig:5 ] ) . on the other hand , in the diluted frustrated 2dqhaf li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6",
    ", such scaling does not seem to be accurate any longer , suggesting that also the effective ratio @xmath16 is changing .",
    "in fact , one has to observe that while the spin hamiltonian for a diluted non - frustrated 2dqhaf on a square - lattice can still be mapped onto the same hamiltonian , provided the exchange coupling is renormalized , the spin hamiltonian for the frustrated 2dqhaf on a square lattice can no longer be mapped onto the same hamiltonian as dilution in the @xmath116 model yields the appearance of triangular spin configurations .    after having presented these arguments suggesting a variation of the effective ratio @xmath13 and a negligible reduction of @xmath75 , the effect of spin vacancies on the distortion initially observed in undoped frustrated systems will be discussed @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 is characterized by @xmath117 and hence by a two - fold degenerate collinear ground - state , with a magnetic wave vector which can be either * q*=(0 , @xmath118 ) or * q*=(@xmath118 , 0 ) . at low - t , after an ising transition , the spin system will eventually collapse in either one of the two collinear ground - states @xcite . now , in a real system a finite spin - lattice coupling exists and for @xmath117 it would favour a tetragonal to orthorombic distortion @xcite . in fact",
    ", the behaviour of @xmath1si nmr spectra and @xmath35 observed in some li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 samples is consistent with such a distortion @xcite .",
    "@xmath1si form factor @xmath119 is peaked at ( q@xmath120 , q@xmath121 ) and vanishes at the critical wavevector * q*=(0 , @xmath118 ) or * q*=(@xmath118 , 0 ) .",
    "hence , on approaching @xmath33 , as the spectral weight shifts to the critical wavevector of the envisaged _ collinear _ order , @xmath35 should decrease and no peak observed .",
    "however , in the pure li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 a peak in @xmath35 was observed suggesting that a distortion modifying @xmath1si form factor takes place @xcite . in ti - doped samples ( fig.4 )",
    "no peak in @xmath1si @xmath35 is observed at @xmath33 , pointing out that ti impurities tend to hinder this distortion .",
    "finally , we point out that above @xmath33 ti doping also hinders the very - low - frequency dynamics evidenced by @xmath2sr measurements in li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ tauc ] ) @xcite .",
    "these dynamics were associated with the motion of domain walls separating regions were correlations with * q*=(0 , @xmath118 ) or * q*=(@xmath118 , 0 ) develop before the lattice distortion removes their degeneracy .",
    "although a clear explanation of such a phenomenon goes beyond the aim of the present work , the observation of a t - independent much longer correlation time measured by @xmath2sr suggests that ti impurities might pin the motions of domain walls .",
    "in conclusion , a throughout investigation of a spin diluted frustrated 2dqhaf system by means of nmr , @xmath2sr and susceptibility measurements has been presented .",
    "it has been shown that the decrease of the magnetic ordering temperature is consistent with a reduction of the spin - stiffness by a factor @xmath12 and with a minor effect of spin dilution on the sublattice magnetization . the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate shows that the effective ratio @xmath13 decreases with @xmath14 , namely that the two coupling constants are not renormalized in the same way by dilution .",
    "this would actually mean that the spin hamiltonian of a frustrated 2dqhaf on a square - lattice can not be mapped onto the same square - lattice hamiltonian after spin dilution has occurred .",
    "finally it was shown that the low frequency dynamics observed in pure li@xmath3vosio@xmath6 by means of @xmath2sr measurements disappears in li@xmath3v@xmath4ti@xmath5osio@xmath6 .",
    "moreover the absence of a peak in @xmath1si nmr relaxation rate at the transition indicates that the distortion induced by frustration might be hindered by doping .",

    "<S> @xmath0li and @xmath1si nmr , @xmath2sr and magnetization measurements in li@xmath3v@xmath4oti@xmath5sio@xmath6 , for @xmath7 , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 compound is a prototype of frustrated two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square - lattice with competing nearest ( @xmath9 ) and next - nearest ( @xmath10 ) neighbour exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> ti@xmath11 ( s=0 ) for v@xmath11 ( s=1/2 ) substitution yields the spin dilution of the antiferromagnetic layers . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the magnetization and of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate shows that spin dilution not only reduces the spin - stiffness by a factor @xmath12 , but also causes the decrease of the effective ratio @xmath13 . moreover , the sublattice magnetization curves derived from zero - field @xmath2sr measurements in the collinear phase point out that , at variance with non - frustrated two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets , spin dilution affects the low - temperature staggered magnetization only to a minor extent . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is supported also by the @xmath14 dependence of the collinear ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for the ti doped samples are discussed in the light of the results previously obtained in the pure @xmath8 compound and in non - frustrated two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with spin - dilution . </S>"
