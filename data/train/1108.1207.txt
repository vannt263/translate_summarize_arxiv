    "it is widely believed that type ia supernovae ( sne ) originate from white dwarf ( wd ) stars that have been pushed close to the chandrasekhar limit , either by accreting matter from a companion star ( single - degenerate scenario ) , or by merging with another wd ( double - degenerate scenario ) @xcite .",
    "the detailed physics of the single - degenerate scenario , particularly the role , if any , that the binary system plays in shaping the surrounding medium is poorly understood .",
    "@xcite suggested that , under certain conditions , accreting wds in a binary system with a main sequence or red giant companion might blow a substantial wind , carving out low - density cavities in the surrounding ism in the @xmath4 yr prior to explosion .",
    "@xcite considered young ( @xmath5 yr ) supernova remnants ( snrs ) known to be of type ia origin , finding that none were consistent with evolution into such a modified medium .    the galactic snr rcw 86 ( g315.4 - 2.3 ; msh 14 - 63 ) is one of a small number of remnants with a historical connection , as it has been proposed to be the remains of sn 185 a.d .",
    "the distance has been reported to be near 1 kpc @xcite , but more recent measurements have put it from 2.3 @xcite to 2.8 kpc @xcite . throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 2.5 kpc , parameterized , where appropriate , as @xmath6 . the claim that this event was a sn",
    "at all has been disputed @xcite , but @xcite review the entirety of the available information on the `` guest star '' of 185 a.d . , concluding that it was indeed a sn , a view supported by the work of @xcite , and that rcw 86 represents the most likely candidate for its remnant .",
    "according to @xcite , the maximum unrefracted altitude of rcw 86 as seen from the city of luoyang , china , was 2.3@xmath7 , leading to an airmass of 18 . under good seeing conditions ( 0.2 magnitudes extinction per airmass ) , the atmospheric extinction would be @xmath8 = 3.6 .",
    "optical measurements have placed the ism extinction at @xmath9 @xcite , so a supernova at 2.5 kpc ( see below ) with , for instance , @xmath10 would appear as a new star of @xmath11 , easily visible to ancient observers .",
    "significant sources of error are possible in virtually all of these parameters . if the chinese historical observations came from a region farther south in china , the airmass in the direction of rcw 86 would be significantly reduced .",
    "for instance , an altitude of 5@xmath7 above the horizon implies 10 airmasses @xcite , reducing the atmospheric extinction to 2 mag .",
    "a brighter type ia sn , which we argue in favor of later , could add another 2 mag to the observed brightness . on the other hand , we report x - ray column densities of @xmath12 @xmath13 , which could raise the interstellar extinction from 2 to 4 mag . in summary",
    ", it appears quite possible that there could have been a supernova visible from china at the position of rcw 86 , at a distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "the recent measurement of high proper motion of the shock , as defined by the onset of x - ray emission in the ne limb implies very fast shocks ( @xmath14 km",
    "s@xmath3 ) @xcite , supporting a young age for the remnant .",
    "the broad fe k@xmath15 line width measured by _ suzaku _ @xcite and the presence of non - thermal synchrotron x - ray emission @xcite also suggest a young snr .",
    "the remnant shows a complete shell at radio , optical , and x - ray energies @xcite , and has recently been detected in tev gamma - rays by h.e.s.s .",
    "shock speeds vary greatly from one side of the remnant to the other , from the high shock speeds in the east to the slower ( 550  650 km s@xmath3 ) shocks in the nw and sw corners , as derived from optical spectroscopy @xcite . @xcite also report that the eastern limb could be a site of significant cosmic - ray acceleration , based on the discrepancy between proper motions of the x - ray emitting filaments and the spectroscopically determined proton temperature .",
    "numerous authors have pointed out the difficulties with reconciling the young age of rcw 86 with its large size . at a distance of 2.5 kpc ,",
    "the average speed of the shock for this large remnant ( @xmath16 in diameter ) is @xmath17 km s@xmath3 , but as previously mentioned , shock speeds in most of the remnant are an order of magnitude less than this .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. , vink et al . 1997 ) that a cavity explosion offers the most natural explanation , with the shock racing through a low - density bubble , recently having encountered a dense shell .",
    "cavity explosions are typically associated with core - collapse ( cc ) supernovae , but the nature of the progenitor system for rcw 86 is uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggested that rcw 86 may be the result of a type ia explosion into a cavity formed by the progenitor system , a scenario that could offer new constraints on accretion wind outflows from single - degenerate progenitor systems of type ia sne .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 and 3 , we report the results of new infrared ( ir ) observations with _ spitzer _ and _",
    "wise_. we discuss the nature of the progenitor system in section  [ progenitor ] , and the evidence for a cavity explosion in section  [ hydro ] .",
    "the nonthermal synchrotron emission is discussed in section 6 , and the gamma - ray emission in section 7 .",
    "ir emission from snrs can be thermal continuum from warm dust grains heated by collisions with energetic ions and electrons in the x - ray emitting gas , line emission from low to medium - ionization states of atoms cooling in the post - shock region , or a combination of the two .",
    "nonthermal emission via synchrotron radiation can contribute as well , but is generally negligible compared to thermal processes @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , emission from younger snrs expanding into a low - density medium ( characterized by non - radiative shocks in the optical ) will be dominated by continuum @xcite , while older shocks or those encountering molecular clouds will become radiative and show strong mid - ir line emission @xcite .",
    "ir studies of snrs offer the possibility to learn about both the conditions of the remnant and the physics of the gas - dust interaction in shocks .",
    "previous ir observations of rcw 86 have led to conflicting results .",
    "@xcite used iras observations to determine that the ir / x - ray flux ratio ( irx ratio ) from the bright sw shell ( the only part of the remnant firmly detected by iras ) is higher than theoretical predictions .",
    "they attributed this to either a dust / gas mass ratio higher than average for the galaxy or a poor coupling between the ir emitting dust and the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "however , @xcite used the same iras data and ir emission model to arrive at the opposite conclusion , namely that the irx ratio for the remnant is lower than predictions by a factor of 10 , implying a low dust / gas mass ratio .",
    "studies done with iras suffer from both poor angular resolution and low sensitivity , and resolving discrepant results such as these requires study by advanced ir telescopes . using _",
    "spitzer _ and _ wise _ , we detect the entire shell at 24 and 22 @xmath0 m and the sw and nw portions at 12 and 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "faint extended emission in the sw is seen in short - wavelength bands as well .",
    "detection of the eastern shell of the remnant is significantly complicated at 70 @xmath0 m by confusion with galactic ir emission .    as part of _ spitzer _ program 50698",
    ", we obtained a full map of the remnant at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m using the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) on 2009 march 31 , just weeks before the end of the cold _ spitzer _ mission .",
    "the size of the remnant ( @xmath18 in diameter ) required two scan maps ( aor i d 26750208 & 26749952 ) of 1@xmath19 @xmath20 0.5@xmath19 , which we mosaicked together using the mopex software provided by the spitzer science center .",
    "we used a medium scan rate for the maps , offsetting each scan leg by @xmath21 to ensure full coverage at 70 @xmath0 m and redundancy by a factor of 2 at 24 @xmath0 m . we used all four channels ( from 3.6 to 8 @xmath0 m ) of the infrared array camera ( irac ) to map a region of @xmath22 on 2009 march 23 ( aor i d 26748928 ) , centered on the brightest filaments in the sw region of the shell seen in x - rays with _ chandra _ ( rho et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter r02 ) .",
    "both the irac and mips data were processed using version 18.7 of the _ spitzer _ pipeline .",
    "the pipeline processed 70 @xmath0 m data contains some artifacts , most notably striping in the direction of the scan leg .    in mid - april of 2011 ,",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) science team released the first half of the data taken by wise , a mid - ir telescope which surveyed the entire sky at 3.3 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m .",
    "rcw 86 was in the region of the sky covered by this initial data release . to provide a more complete picture of the ir properties of the snr",
    ", we have downloaded the _ wise _ images of this remnant at all four wavelengths .",
    "we show the mips images at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m in figure  [ images ] , along with x - ray and optical images as described in the caption . at 24 @xmath0 m , where the angular resolution of the telescope is @xmath23 , the correlation between the ir , x - ray , and optical images is significant , implying a tight coupling between the ir emitting dust and the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "a strong correlation exists for the 70 @xmath0 m data ( resolution @xmath24 ) as well in the sw and nw portions of the shell ; however , the eastern part of the shell is dominated by emission that is likely from a foreground or background region .",
    "the ir colors in the e region allow us to trace the forward shock and make a determination of what is and is not associated with the remnant . at 24 @xmath0 m , the much lower background level allows distinction between this region and the thin , non - radiative filaments of the blast wave .",
    "we show a three - color irac image in figure  [ 4panel_irac ] , where a few faint filaments are observed that correspond to features seen at 24 @xmath0 m . these filaments also appear as radiative filaments in the [ s ii ] image @xcite , making it likely that the irac emission comes from lines ( most likely [ ar ii ] at 7 @xmath0 m and [ fe ii ] at 5.4 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "it is possible that emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) heated immediately behind the shock front could contribute as well , although the lifetime of these molecules is quite short in the post shock environment .    a mosaic of the _ wise _ 4.6 @xmath0 m , 12 @xmath0 m , and _ spitzer _",
    "24 @xmath0 m images is shown in figure  [ spitzerwise ] .",
    "wise data show the entire periphery of the shell at 22 @xmath0 m ( though with a lower angular resolution than with _ spitzer _ ) , as well as significant portions of the sw shell at 12 @xmath0 m , where the _ wise _ resolution is comparable with _",
    "spitzer s _ at 24 @xmath0 m . faint emission from the nw filament is detectable at 12 @xmath0 m as well . at 4.6 and 3.3 @xmath0 m",
    ", only a small filament is visible in the extreme sw , a filament which was not covered by the spatially limited irac map .",
    "the colors of this image , which reflect the temperature of the dust , separate the emission that is associated with the snr from that of the background .",
    "this is particularly important in the east , where the thin red filaments trace the blast wave .      for our analysis , we selected two regions in the remnant with detections at both 24 and 70 @xmath0 m : a small region in the bright sw `` corner '' that corresponds to purely non - radiative emission , as identified in optical images , and a filament in the nw stretching @xmath25 .",
    "the regions are indicated in figure  [ images ] and figure  [ 4panel_irac ] , and are significantly larger than the angular resolution of _ spitzer _ at 70 @xmath0 m . to measure the flux",
    ", we chose several local background regions outside of the remnant near the region of interest .",
    "the background is somewhat variable , particularly in the nw , so we average the background subtracted fluxes and report the standard deviation of these measurements as the error . because we are interested in the emission from dust only , we must account for both stars and line emission from cooling gas .",
    "neither region contains bright stellar sources , and only the 24 @xmath0 m image shows any stars at all in the region of interest .",
    "we excise regions at 24 @xmath0 m where stars are seen , using irac ( where available ) and optical images to determine the stellar nature of unresolved sources . despite no visible stars in the regions at 70 @xmath0 m , we excise the same regions when measuring the 70 @xmath0 m flux . we find that stellar contamination to the 24 @xmath0 m flux is negligible in the small sw region and accounts for 15% in the larger nw region .",
    "the integrated flux from the excised regions at 70 @xmath0 m was less than 1% of the total .",
    "fluxes reported in this work are the `` star - subtracted '' fluxes .",
    "we measure fluxes in the sw of 0.37 and 1.41 jy at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m , respectively , and 0.69 and 3.10 jy in the nw .",
    "errors on these flux measurements are @xmath26 in the sw and @xmath27 in the nw , where the larger errors in the nw result from a fainter , more diffuse source region with a more variable background .",
    "the 70/24 @xmath0 m flux ratios are 3.8@xmath28 and 4.5@xmath29 in the sw and nw , respectively .",
    "to account for the contribution of line emission to the integrated fluxes , we use irs spectra taken as part of our _ spitzer _ observing program .",
    "we defer analysis of the irs data to a future publication , but note that a spatially integrated low - resolution spectrum from the sw shell shows the presence of the [ fe ii]/[o iv ] line blend at @xmath30 @xmath0 m ( the lines are unresolved by the spectrograph , which has spectral resolution @xmath31 @xmath32 ) .",
    "this line lies on top of a strong dust continuum , and when we integrate the irs spectrum over the mips 24 @xmath0 m bandpass and response curve , the total line flux accounts for 1.2% of the observed 24 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "the extraction region for this spectrum is shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ images ] , and lies on top of both radiative and non - radiative filaments . although we do not have irs spectra of the nw filament , radiative shocks there are fainter , and we expect that line contamination to the 24 @xmath0 m fluxes should be even less important than in the sw .",
    "we do not have spectral data extending to the wavelengths of the 70 @xmath0 m detector , but the bandpass of that filter is extremely broad ( fwhm @xmath33 m ) , and any lines present , such as [ o i ] at 63 @xmath0 m or [ o iii ] at 88 @xmath0 m ( where filter throughput is only 14% ) would have to be extraordinarily strong to contribute significant flux .",
    "we thus ignore any line contributions to the fluxes reported above .",
    "to model ir emission , we follow a procedure identical to that described in previous works @xcite .",
    "the heating rate of a grain immersed in a hot plasma depends on both the post - shock gas density ( collision rate ) and temperature ( energy per collision ) . in general",
    ", the temperature of a plasma can be determined by fits to x - ray spectra .",
    "dust heating models depend on this temperature , but this dependency is not strong @xcite .",
    "the density of the gas is a more sensitive parameter for dust heating models and controls the temperature of the grains ( i.e. the 70/24 @xmath0 m flux ratio ) .",
    "we regard the gas density as a free model parameter and adjust it to match the observed ir fluxes .",
    "we account for sputtering of grains by ions , using a plane - shock model that superimposes regions of increasing sputtering timescale , defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the post - shock proton density , while keeping temperature behind the shock constant .",
    "( note that the sputtering timescale is directly related to the ionization timescale used in x - rays , defined as @xmath36 ) inputs to the model are a pre - shock grain size distribution , grain type and abundance ( for these quantities , we use models for the galaxy from @xcite , which contain a mixture of amorphous silicate and graphite grains ) , and ion and electron temperature and density .",
    "the code calculates heating and sputtering for grains from 1 nm to 1 @xmath0 m , producing a unique temperature and spectrum for each grain size .",
    "the spectra are summed according to the post - sputtering size distribution to produce a single model spectrum .",
    "we use sputtering rates from @xcite with enhancements for small grains from @xcite .",
    "although we do not include it in our calculations , we note that the shock speeds in this remnant are only slightly above the upper threshold , reported by @xcite as 500 km s@xmath3 , where nonthermal , or ballistic sputtering effects begin to become important .",
    "to determine kt and @xmath37 for the x - ray emitting gas , we analyze x - ray spectra from archival _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "chandra _ data were obtained in 2001 ( obs .",
    "i d 1993 ) , where the sw shell was observed for 92 ks .",
    "we reprocessed and extracted the data using version 4.3 of the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) .",
    "we obtained archival x - ray data in the nw rim and sw corner from the _ xmm - newton _ epic - mos detectors , observed in 2007 ( obs .",
    "i d 0504810401 & 0504810301 , j. vink , p.i . ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were processed using version 9.0 of the science analysis software ( sas ) for xmm .",
    "we filtered the data from mos 1 and mos 2 for flares and bad pixels , grouping the data to a minimum of 25 counts per bin .",
    "we fit the data using version 12.6.0 of _ xspec _ @xcite .",
    "[ [ sw ] ] sw ~~    r02 used the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ to uncover a complex system of shocks in the sw , with hard regions from the shocked ejecta mixed with softer regions from shocked ism and regions dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "we employ a similar modeling procedure to that used in r02 to fit the x - ray spectra from our region in the sw .",
    "we jointly fit _",
    "acis and _ xmm - newton _ epic - mos 2 data ( this particular region falls on the dead mos 1 chip ) , letting the abundances of c , n ( tied to c ) , o , mg , si , and fe float freely .",
    "we find a reasonable fit with kt @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 @xmath1 s. the reduced @xmath40 value in this simple model is rather high , @xmath41 .",
    "r02 found similarly poor values of @xmath40 in modeling emission from this region , attributing it to poor fe l - shell data in low temperature plasmas ( see discussion in section 3.2 of that paper ) . excising the regions of the spectra that were poorly fit",
    "improved the value of @xmath40 , but did not affect the fitted parameters of the thermal model , which are fully listed in table  [ xrayparams ] .",
    "freezing these parameters ( @xmath42 and @xmath37 ) in our dust heating model , we find that the ir luminosity and flux ratio are best fit with a post - shock density of @xmath43 = 2.4 ( 2.1 , 2.75 ) @xmath1 and a radiating dust mass of 3.2 @xmath44 ( 2.7 , 3.9 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "lower and upper limits , listed in parentheses , are derived from fitting dust emission models to the extrema of the @xmath47 ratio .",
    "we assume that @xmath48 kev , which is appropriate for the shock speeds and ages seen in this section of the remnant @xcite . in any case",
    ", grain heating at these temperatures is done almost entirely by electrons @xcite .",
    "[ [ nw ] ] nw ~~    we show the 0.4 - 7 kev epic - mos spectra from the nw in figure  [ nwxray ] .",
    "the shock speed of this filament is 580 - 660 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "visible in the spectra is a continuum extending to high energies , featureless except for an fe k@xmath15 line at @xmath49 kev .",
    "we account for these components with an _ srcut",
    "_ model for the synchrotron emission @xcite and an fe - only _ vpshock _ model with kt = 5 kev and @xmath50 = @xmath51 @xmath1 s. r02 also found fe k@xmath15 emission in the sw , where shock speeds and plasma temperatures are also relatively low , attributing it to reverse - shocked ejecta .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nonthermal continuum in the nw does not show the same morphology as the low - energy thermal emission .",
    "thermal x - rays in that region are well contained to the thin filament seen in figure  [ images ] , but the synchrotron emission appears much more diffuse .",
    "we show this in figure  [ nw_nontherm ] .",
    "similar discrepancies were observed in the sw , leading r02 to conclude that the synchrotron emission is associated with reverse shocks driven into the ejecta , and not the forward shock .",
    "we follow the same modeling procedure as for the sw , and fit the spectra with a _ vpshock _ model ( with high - energy components added as described above ) . in this region , we jointly fit mos 1 and 2 data , as this part of the remnant has not been observed with _ chandra_. the best fit model ( reduced @xmath40 = 2.20 ) has kt = 0.28 ( 0.27 , 0.30 ) kev and @xmath50 = 9.9 ( 8.7 , 11.1 ) @xmath52 @xmath1 s , with an emission measure ( em ) for the thermal component of 2.51 @xmath44 ( 1.90 , 2.91 ) @xmath53 @xmath1 ( 2.15 @xmath44 ( 1.63 , 2.49 ) @xmath1 @xmath46 ) .",
    "we let the abundances of c , n ( tied to c ) , o , mg , si , and fe float freely in the model , and find that all are in the neighborhood of solar ( using @xcite abundances ) , with the exception of si ( 1.7 solar ) and mg ( 0.6 solar ) .",
    "ne was kept fixed to solar as an anchor for the other abundances , as ne is not expected in the ejecta of a type ia sn , and is not depleted onto grains in the ism .",
    "the overabundance of si is likely a result of using a single - temperature shock model to fit the data . as we show in section  [ hydro ] , the shock structure is likely more complicated than this , with varying shock speeds , and a single - temperature shock model with kt = 0.28 kev could underpredict the si k@xmath15 line at 1.8 kev .",
    "the model compensates for this by making si overabundant .",
    "mg underabundance might be caused by depeletion onto dust grains .",
    "we find a post - shock density from matching ir data of @xmath43 = 2.0 ( 0.75 , 5.0 ) @xmath1 and a radiating dust mass of 1.2 @xmath44 ( 0.33 , 3.6 ) @xmath54 @xmath46 .",
    "the large uncertainties for this region are a result of the errors in the flux measurement ( see section  [ fluxes ] ) .",
    "the plasma temperature derived from this model is significantly lower than that of @xcite , who fit _ xmm _ spectra from a similar region in the nw with a two - component nei model , finding temperatures of @xmath55 and 4 kev .",
    "however , our temperature is close to that reported by @xcite , although they report lower ionization timescales .",
    "the difference is likely due to the fact that our `` nw '' spectrum is extracted from a region that is farther east than theirs , and much brighter in both x - rays and ir , implying a higher density .",
    "differences also result from different spectral models used .",
    "it is worth noting that the ionization timescales obtained from fitting x - ray spectra , combined with the post - shock densities from fitting ir data , allow a determination of the age of the shock .",
    "we obtain ages of @xmath56 and @xmath57 yr for the sw and nw , respectively .",
    "these ages , derived from plane - shock model fits , are underestimates for the true age of the remnant @xcite , but do strongly favor a young snr , strengthening the case for rcw 86 as the remnant of sn 185 a.d .",
    "where dust is present and x - ray spectra of the swept - up ambient medium can be examined , this method provides a useful check on the ages of young snrs .    in modeling dust emission from the post - shock environment",
    ", we focus only on the _ spitzer _ data , as the wavelengths covered with _",
    "spitzer _ are more appropriate for the bulk of the dust emission seen in an snr .",
    "wise data at 22 @xmath0 m do not further constrain the models discussed later , and 12 @xmath0 m data are sensitive to a poorly - understood hot dust component , likely from very small dust grains which are stochastically heated . the ir model above predicts a flux of 100 mjy at 12 @xmath0 m , while the measured flux from _ wise _ in this region is 430 mjy ( albeit with a @xmath58 error ) .",
    "a similar excess of short - wavelength ir emission above a model fit to 24 and 70 @xmath0 m was found in our _ spitzer _ analysis of kepler s snr @xcite .",
    "emission at this wavelength would likely come from very small dust grains , and the physics of collisional heating and sputtering of such small grains is not well understood .",
    "see section 3.3 of @xcite for further discussion of the difficulties in modeling short wavelength ir emission .",
    "however , this emission from very small grains should have little effect on the overall properties derived from the ir fits .",
    "if the 70 @xmath0 m data were ignored , and only the 12 and 24 @xmath0 m data were fit with a single - temperature grain model , the temperature of the grains would be 190 k , and the radiating mass would be only 2.4 @xmath44 @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that significant work still needs to be done to understand short - wavelength ir emission from dust in snrs .",
    "@xcite provide theoretical predictions for the ratio of the total ir luminosity to the 0.24 kev x - ray luminosity , a quantity that they refer to as the irx ratio .",
    "at the temperature of the nw region , this ratio should be @xmath60 .",
    "our dust model calculates the amount of sputtering of grains in the post - shock gas , and for the nw region we find that 19% of the total dust mass has been destroyed .",
    "accounting for this mass , and considering only the unabsorbed thermal component ( _ vpshock _ ) of our x - ray spectral fit described above , we find an irx ratio of 1.65 , lower than the predicted value by a factor of 20 , which implies a dust - to - gas mass ratio for the pre - shock ism lower than the standard galactic value assumed by @xcite .",
    "the irx ratio for the sw region is 1.4 .",
    "we can approach this issue in another way .",
    "the x - ray em for the thermal component in the nw region is 2.15 @xmath44 @xmath1 @xmath46 .",
    "since we have ( from the ir fits ) an independent determination of the post - shock density , we can divide this out of the em and get the amount of gas that has been swept up by the shock , which is roughly a solar mass .",
    "normalizations to the ir spectra give the radiating dust mass , and dividing these two gives another measure ( also distance - independent ) of the dust - to - gas mass ratio , 1.37 @xmath54 , where we have accounted for 19% of the mass in grains being destroyed via sputtering . the typical value for the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the milky way is 7.5 @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we thus confirm our finding from above of a low irx ratio , with a dust - to - gas mass ratio that is roughly a factor of 5 too low .",
    "the discrepancy between an irx ratio that is 20 times too low and a dust - to - gas mass ratio that is 5 times too low primarily results from the assumption by @xcite that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . in models for the x - ray emission from rcw 86 ,",
    "the plasma is in a non - equilibrium ionization state , which significantly raises the amount of x - ray emission when compared to a cie model .",
    "for example , if kt = 0.35 kev and @xmath37 = @xmath61 @xmath1 s , a plane - shock model will produce @xmath41 times more x - ray emission than a raymond - smith plasma in cie .",
    "we arrive at a similar conclusion in the sw , where the dust / gas mass ratio is found to be 1.3 @xmath54 , but note that both of these methods will miss any dust that is too cold to emit at 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "similar dust / gas mass ratio shortfalls have been observed in snrs in both the galaxy @xcite and the lmc @xcite .",
    "the nature of the progenitor sn of rcw 86 is uncertain , with most authors favoring a cc origin .",
    "support for the cc model primarily comes from @xcite , who placed the location of the snr within an association of ten b - type stars at a distance of 2.5 kpc ( although one of these stars is likely a foreground object , and another has a doubtful association based on its distance ) .",
    "these stars are spread out over a much larger region of space than the periphery of the snr .",
    "recent optical studies of the remnant have used line kinematics of the narrow h@xmath15 components of various shocks in the remnant , along with galactic rotation curves , to place the distance to the remnant at 2.3 - 2.8 kpc @xcite , confirming that the remnant and the ob association are at approximately the same distance .",
    "however , this proximity to the association does not preclude a type ia progenitor much older and less massive than the b - type stars found in this region of our galaxy .",
    "this is illustrated by n103b , a young remnant in the large magellanic cloud known to be the result of a type ia sn , that is apparently associated with the h ii region n103 .",
    "@xcite examined the local star formation history near n103b and found a prominent extended peak between 100 and 50 myr .",
    "a mixture of young and old stellar populations is likely present near rcw 86 as well , so both type ia and cc explosions may occur at this particular location within our galaxy .",
    "secondary support for the cc origin comes from the suggestion , first made by @xcite , that rcw 86 is an explosion into a cavity .",
    "cavity explosions are typically associated with cc sne and the strong winds that some massive stars may blow off prior to explosion . however , as shown in @xcite and @xcite , accreting wd systems , the progenitors of single - degenerate type ia sne , can also create substantial wind - blown cavities .    both the arguments in favor of a cc origin are valid , but are circumstantial and based on general associations rather than specific observations of the remnant . here , we critically examine available observations of rcw 86 , and find that the remnant is more likely the remnant of a type ia sn .",

    "the mechanism for this h@xmath15 emission is described in @xcite . at the densities",
    "derived above from ir observations , h recombination times are @xmath62 yr . most cc sne ionize the surrounding medium in one of two ways , either from the radiation from the shock breakout ( in the case of a red supergiant ) or before the sn from the ionizing flux from the progenitor star itself ( in the case of a wolf - rayet star ) .",
    "a hot , compact progenitor of a stripped cc type ib / c sn would produce relatively few ionizing photons in the explosion , but would have a strong ionizing flux before the explosion , as the progenitors of these sne are massive o - type stars during their main - sequence lifetime , which proceed through a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase to shed their h ( and possibly he ) envelope , becoming wolf - rayet stars . less massive ( @xmath63 ) , cooler stars will be red supergiants ( rsg ) at the time of the explosion . while they are too cool to ionize material beforehand , their large size results in a large ionizing flux at shock breakout .",
    "@xcite discusses the ionizing radiation from the shock breakout of a cc sn . for the amount of mass that the shock has encountered in rcw 86 ( as constrained from model fits to ir data ; see section  [ hydro ] ) , explosions of rsgs ( r @xmath64 ) , including type iip , type iil , and even type iib sne like 1993j @xcite are likely ruled out , as they produce more than enough ionizing radiation .",

    "the only remaining cc scenario which can not be ruled out from this perspective is an explosion of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor with a massive h envelope , such as sn 1987a , producing only a modest number of ionizing photons , but see points 2 and 3 below .",

    "alternatively , detection of a compact remnant ( neutron star , pulsar - wind nebula , or black hole ) that is definitively associated with the remnant would clearly imply a cc explosion . finally ,",

    "the mechanism for the creation of the winds modeled by @xcite is described in @xcite . a high mass accretion rate from a red - giant ( rg ) or main - sequence companion onto a white dwarf ( wd ) can lead to the formation of a large , loosely bound envelope surrounding the wd .",
    "this envelope is optically thick , and continuum - driven winds from the wd can eject several tenths of a solar mass from the system .",
    "the wind stops when the mass transfer rate falls below @xmath75 yr@xmath3 , which can be as long as 10@xmath76 yr before the wd accretes enough mass to reach the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "we perform hydrodynamic simulations of type ia explosions into various surroundings using vh-1 , a numerical hydrodynamics code developed by j. blondin and collaborators based on the piecewise parabolic method of @xcite .",

    "in addition to the density in this model being more than an order of magnitude below that required to produce ir emission in the nw and sw , the current forward shock velocity in this model is @xmath81 = 3000 km s@xmath3 , well above that measured from optical spectroscopy .",
    "an alternative model can reach 12 pc with a current shock velocity of 600 km s@xmath3 by encountering a medium of @xmath80 = 0.75 @xmath1 . while this model is consistent with both the measured shock velocities and the inferred densities from ir , the time required for this shock to reach the observed radius is 7000 years , ruling out an association with sn 185 a.d .",
    "a third option is to require the shock to decelerate to 600 km s@xmath3 in 1800 years , but this model requires an ambient density of @xmath80 = 40 @xmath1 and places the current radius of the forward shock at 3.2 pc .",
    "the distance to the remnant derived from this value would be 650 pc , well inside any previous distance estimates .",
    "similar calculations show that reasonable under- or over - energetic sne likewise fail to reproduce anything close to the observed remnant .",
    "given the results of models discussed above , we can rule out the case of a blast wave from an explosion in 185 a.d . encountering a uniform ambient density",
    ". the next level of complexity that we consider is a low - density , uniform bubble ( region i ) surrounded by higher - density , uniform ism ( region ii ) .",
    "a constant wind blown from the progenitor system would lead to an @xmath82 density profile , but a uniform bubble could be created by simply switching off the wind a few thousand years prior to the explosion ; delay times prior to explosion in @xcite are well in excess of this in most cases .",
    "since our ir modeling gives us a direct measurement of the post - shock density of the material recently shocked , we have one more constraint to use in these models , and we fix the ambient density in the ism to the post - shock density from ir fits ( @xmath83 @xmath1 ) divided by a compression ratio of 4 , i.e. @xmath84 = 0.5 @xmath1 . with this number fixed , the number of free parameters in our bubble model is only two : the density within the bubble , which we define as @xmath85 , and the location of the bubble `` wall , '' which we define as @xmath86 .",

    "we can use a semi - analytic approximation to check the final shock speed ( 740 km s@xmath3 ) , by assuming that the internal energy in the shocked ejecta is the dominant energy component , significantly greater than the internal energy in the shocked shell or the kinetic energies of the ejecta and shell material . in this approximation ,",

    "once the assumption of a uniform ambient density is abandoned , the parameter space for possible density structures that the shock can encounter is vast .",
    "the solution above of a shock running through a low - density bubble and encountering the much higher density ism is not unique , but it is not our aim to explore every possible scenario .",

    "the total mass lost by the system is 0.15 @xmath46 , with an outflow velocity of 1000 km s@xmath3 , and the time between the onset of the final mass transfer and the sn explosion is 5 @xmath99 yr . the `` bubble '' created by this system has a roughly constant density of 0.001 @xmath1 with a shell wall located at @xmath100 pc .",
    "the density in the ism is fixed at 0.42 @xmath1 , with the exception of a shell at the bubble - ism interface with a density higher by a factor of @xmath83 .",
    "we assume that the blast wave is contained within this shell .",
    "this model also provides an explanation for the fe k@xmath15 line seen in the x - ray spectrum from the narrow extraction region in nw , where the elliptical region is quite narrow compared to the shock radius .",
    "the extraction region , shown in figure  [ images ] , begins at a radial distance of 93% of the forward shock radius .",
    "shocked ejecta can not exist this far out in the 1-d model , but this is only indicative of the limitations of modeling a multi - dimensional system in 1-d . in two dimensions ( 2-d ) ,",

    "we show the output of a 2-d model at the current age of the remnant in figure  [ 2dmodel ] , which shows significant amounts of shocked ejecta at a radius of @xmath101 of the forward shock radius .",
    "we can also use the output of the hydrodynamic modeling , combined with x - ray spectroscopy , to estimate the amount of reverse - shocked fe present in the nw extraction region .",
    "the em , as fit to the fe k@xmath15 line in the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum for the fe - only component , is 7.2 @xmath102 @xmath1 @xmath46 .",

    "despite the general agreements listed above between our 2-d hydrodynamic model and the measured properties of the remnant , one thing this model can not account for is the extremely high shock speed reported for the ne limb , found from _",

    "our hydro model assumes spherical symmetry for the distance from the explosion to the shell wall , and this symmetry must be broken to explain shock speeds that differ by an order of magnitude from one side of the remnant to the other .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a detailed multi - dimensional model to explain the morphological `` squareness '' and varying shock speeds of rcw 86 ; such a model would undoubtedly be highly complex .",
    "rather , we seek the simplest case that can broadly explain the observations , that of an off - center explosion into a wind - blown bubble , in which the shock has not yet reached the bubble wall in the ne .",
    "we assume that the wind - blown bubble is symmetric with a radius of 12 pc .",
    "we then vary the distance , r@xmath107 , from the center of the bubble to the center of explosion .",

    "is required for a shock that roughly reproduces the observables ( shock velocity , density , age ) in the sw , yet still allows for the extremely high shock speeds in the ne . to avoid hitting the far side ( @xmath114 ) of the shell wall in 1825 yr",

    "the hydrodynamic output of this model is shown in figure  [ offcenter ] . @xcite",

    ", the shock hits the filament in @xmath119 yr , reaching a final radius ( with respect to the center of the remnant ) of 12.7 pc with a velocity of 550 km s@xmath3 , numbers which agree quite well with observations .",
    "this model implies that the shock has only recently encountered the shell in the e and se .",
    "the ionization timescale of the shocked ism in the e , as reported by @xcite , was 7.7 @xmath52 @xmath1 s. this is rather high for a recently shocked shell , but the authors point out that densities in this region are likely much higher than the rest of the shell , and that the ionization timescale of the reverse shocked fe implies a shock age of @xmath120 yr .",
    "thus , there is a broad consistency of observable parameters with the off - center explosion model , including the transition from thermal to nonthermal x - rays in the ne corner of the remnant , where , in our model , the shock has not yet hit the bubble wall .",

    "most young snrs show synchrotron x - rays concentrated in `` thin rims '' at the periphery ( see reynolds 2008 for a review ) .",

    "r02 showed that , given a geometric effect that can speed up particle acceleration in perpendicular shocks ( jokipii 1987 ) , shocks of the speed of the optical nonradiative shocks in the sw ( @xmath128 km s@xmath3 ) could accelerate electrons to this energy .",
    "however , without this obliquity effect , shock velocities in excess of 1000 km s@xmath3 are more typically required .",
    "such shocks have not been present in the sw since the collision about 1500 yr ago of the blast wave with the bubble wall .",
    "however , at that time the blast - wave speed was of order 10,000 km s@xmath3 in our scenario , and acceleration to very high energies ( 100 tev or above ) would have been possible due to the strong dependence of maximum energy on shock speed ( @xmath129 for loss - limited acceleration ) . in this case , presumably a `` thin rim '' morphology would have resulted , but the rolloff frequency would have been considerably higher than observed today . but",
    "electrons with energies below @xmath124 of that time have longer lifetimes : the time for an electron of energy @xmath130 tev to lose half its energy is @xmath131 yr . combining this with the relation between energy and characteristic frequency",
    ", we find that electrons with characteristic frequency @xmath132 can survive for a time @xmath133 if they radiate in a magnetic field less than @xmath134 ( we note that if @xmath135 g , the magnetic - field strength with energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , then inverse - compton losses from cmb photons will dominate synchrotron losses .",
    "however , this is unlikely to be the case in rcw 86 or other young snrs . ) for rcw 86 , electrons with @xmath136 hz can survive for 1500 yr if @xmath137 g .",
    "synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated over 1500 years ago would not be expected to be concentrated in thin rims ; it could occupy the entire region of shocked bubble material , and would appear in projection as diffuse emission extending back into the remnant interior , as observed . for younger remnants like tycho ,",
    "thin rims ( according to the synchrotron - loss scenario ) imply much higher magnetic fields which would deplete all electrons capable of producing x - rays . however , in rcw 86 and perhaps other cavity explosions , it is natural to expect diffuse , long - lasting synchrotron x - ray emission , as long as magnetic field strengths remain relatively low .",
    "acceleration to very high energies , while the blast wave is still inside ( or within ) the bubble , would produce a population of electrons that could go on emitting a synchrotron spectrum up to x - ray energies , even if the subsequent shock transmitted into the dense surroundings rapidly becomes too slow to accelerate electrons to tev energies .",
    "a detailed analysis of the x - ray synchrotron emission from all around the periphery of rcw 86 is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be undertaken to test this suggestion and to clarify the current state and past history of electron acceleration in rcw 86 .",
    "we can use our ir fitted densities to make an order of magnitude estimate regarding the gamma - ray emission observed . in the hadronic model of gamma - ray emission , cosmic - rays escaping the shock collide with thermal gas particles , producing @xmath138 particles which decay into gamma - rays .",
    "the 1 - 10 tev spectrum from h.e.s.s . is fit with a photon index of @xmath139 = 2.41 @xcite .",
    "if extrapolated back to 100 mev , this gives a luminosity , l@xmath140 = 1.19 @xmath141 photons s@xmath3 .",
    "using the gamma - ray emissivity from @xcite , the energy density in relativistic particles for a spherical snr required to produce a @xmath142-ray luminosity of l@xmath143 by this process is    @xmath144    where l@xmath140 is the luminosity , in photons s@xmath3 , of 100 mev @xmath142-rays , d is the distance to the remnant , @xmath145 is the radius of the remnant in arcminutes , @xmath43 is the post - shock proton density , and q@xmath143 is the production rate of @xmath142-rays , in units of s@xmath3 erg@xmath3 @xmath146 h@xmath3 .",
    "we take a representative value from @xcite of q@xmath143 = 5 @xmath147 and calculate @xmath148 = 5.1 @xmath149 ergs @xmath1 for rcw 86 .",
    "if we make the ( admittedly crude ) assumption that the nw filament typifies the entire remnant , then the total energy density ( @xmath150 ) of the thermal gas is 4.2 @xmath151 ergs @xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath152 = 12 , requiring an order of magnitude more energy going into relativistic particles than is available in the shock .",
    "a more realistic value for this ratio , 0.1 , requires a flattening of the gamma - ray spectrum below 1 tev to @xmath139 = 1.9 .",
    "we thus confirm the conclusions of @xcite , who based their argument for the low - energy hardening of the @xmath142-ray spectrum on the total energy from the sn of @xmath153 ergs .",
    "any particle acceleration occuring in the remnant would rob the post - shock gas of energy , raising the shock compression ratio across the shock .",
    "we can not determine this ratio directly , since we do not have a direct measure of the emitting volume of the nw region .",
    "however , since we have the post - shock density and total shocked gas mass , the volume for a `` standard '' shock with a compression ratio of 4 would be 1.52 @xmath53 @xmath146 . assuming @xmath154 kpc , the projected radii of the elliptical region are 4.7 and 0.62 pc for the major and minor axes , and the line - of - sight depth through the filament would be 4.3 pc , a factor of 7 greater than the radial width .",
    "this is the minimum line - of - sight , as anything shorter would imply a cr @xmath155 4 .",
    "_ spitzer _ and _ wise _ mid - ir images show the complete shell of rcw 86 , with the dominant source of emission being warm dust grains heated and sputtered in the post - shock environment .",
    "a combined ir / x - ray analysis yields post - shock densities in the non - radiative regions of the nw and sw of @xmath43 = 2.0 @xmath1 and 2.4 @xmath1 , respectively , with @xmath156% of the dust in these regions destroyed via sputtering .",
    "based on the ir / x - ray flux ratio , we find that the dust / gas mass ratio in the pre - shock medium is lower by a factor of @xmath157 from that typical for the galaxy .",
    "the post - shock gas densities derived from ir observations place strong constraints on the total amount of mass that has been encountered by the shock , and favor a young age for the snr , strengthening the case for an association with sn 185 .",
    "x - ray and optical evidence points to a type ia origin for the progenitor of rcw 86 .",
    "the presence of balmer - dominated shocks around the periphery of a young snr means that the blast wave is encountering neutral material , and most cc sne ionize significant portions of the surrounding ism , much more than is observed here .",
    "there are snrs which are believed to be the result of explosions within a cavity and show balmer emission at the shock front ( e.g. , the cygnus loop , believed to be the remnant of a cc sn ) , but these are older objects where the forward shocks have encountered significantly more mass ( the swept mass of the cygnus loop is likely @xmath158 , based on the densities obtained by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "not all cc explosions can be ruled out because of the h@xmath15 emission , but the amount of fe in the ejecta relative to o and other elements also indicates a type ia origin .",
    "the x - ray analyses of the amount of fe relative to o in the ejecta have been taken from references already in the literature , but the constraints on the ionizing flux from the progenitor come from the new ir observations presented here .",
    "there is additional evidence to support the claim that rcw 86 is the result of a type ia sn , in that blue supergiant explosions , which may avoid ionizing the surrounding medium , are incompatible with optical observations , and that no compact remnant or pulsar - wind nebula has ever been detected .    most intriguingly then , we find that if rcw 86 is the remnant of 185 a.d . , and is also the result of a type ia sn , then the only self - consistent model to explain the ir , x - ray , and optical observations is that of an explosion into a cavity created by the progenitor system , a model which requires a single - degenerate progenitor .",
    "we used one and two - dimensional hydrodynamic models to arrive at this conclusion , finding that a simple model of an explosion in a low - density bubble surrounded by a higher density shell can approximately reproduce observed shock radii , velocities , and post - shock gas densities .",
    "the density contrast between the bubble and the shell is 250 .",
    "this model does not require an appeal to any special circumstances , such as an exceptionally recent encounter with the shell wall or a sub / super - energetic explosion .",
    "the high proper motion of the x - ray emitting filaments in the ne , and thus the inferred high shock speed there , requires the explosion to be off - center , so that the shock in that region has not yet encountered the dense shell . in this model ,",
    "the blast wave began encountering the dense ism @xmath159 yr ago and continues to impact parts of the shell .",
    "the fast , synchrotron x - ray emitting shocks in the ne are still encountering ionized material within the bubble , and thus no balmer emission should be expected from these shocks . in the places where the shock is encountering the shell of the bubble",
    ", it does so at an oblique angle .",
    "x - ray proper motion measurements are sensitive to the speed at which the shock moves as it encounters the shell , which is @xmath160 km s@xmath3 in the 2-d hydrodynamic model .",
    "the broad h@xmath15 line width , on the other hand , will reflect the post - shock temperature within the dense shell , where the transmitted shock is considerably slower . in our hydro model , the shock speed of the h@xmath15 emitting shocks within the dense shell is @xmath161 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we did not adjust this model to match the values for the ne , nonetheless , these values are quite close to the 6000 and 1100 km s@xmath3 shocks reported for that region by @xcite",
    ".    thus , this model offers an alternative explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the shock speed measured by proper motions and that derived from optical line kinematics , which @xcite attributed to significant cosmic - ray accleration , with @xmath162 of the shock energy going into cosmic rays . while we do not rule it out",
    ", our model does not require any acceleration of cosmic rays at the shock front .",
    "the synchrotron emission in rcw 86 is complicated , with the sw and nw showing more diffuse emission than the ne , where rims are sharper .",
    "the bubble model offers a natural explanation for this . in the regions of the remnant where the shock encountered the shell long ago",
    ", the electrons were accelerated by much faster shocks than are currently present there . for reasonable values of the magnetic field",
    ", these electrons can survive to the current age of rcw 86 .",
    "this idea may find applicability in another older snr traditionally ascribed to a cavity explosion : the cygnus loop , where gev emission has recently been detected by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite ( katagiri et al . , submitted ) .",
    "electrons accelerated early in the life of the cygnus loop , while its blast wave moved rapidly through the low - density bubble , could persist for the estimated age of order 10,000 yr ( e.g. , levenson et al .",
    "1998 ) with energies as large as @xmath163 tev .",
    "such electrons could produce gamma rays by inverse - compton scattering of various photon fields . as a rough example",
    ", 1 gev photons could be produced from upscattering cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( @xmath164 ev ) by electrons with lorentz factors @xmath165 , or electron energies of about 1 tev .",
    "electrons with these energies could easily survive from an early period of rapid particle acceleration as long as @xmath166 g or so in the regions they inhabit . in a current magnetic field @xmath167 , they would have characteristic frequencies of synchrotron radiation @xmath168 hz , i.e. , in the near - ir , so no nonthermal x - rays would be expected .",
    "thus , rcw 86 may indeed be the first example of a type ia explosion in a system in which the progenitor carved a wind - blown bubble , and can provide new insight into the outflows from accreting systems . while the hydro simulations themselves _ can not _",
    "distinguish between a type ia and cc progenitor system , they can rule out the case of a uniform ambient density .",
    "we find a general agreement with the parameters of the bubble model necessary to explain the dynamics of the remnant and the simulations of @xcite , who modeled the outflows of single - degenerate type ia progenitor systems .",
    "in such a system , the companion star would retain its generally high velocity after the explosion .",
    "a star in a binary system with a period of a few days can have an orbital velocity , @xmath169 , of up to several hundred km s@xmath3 .",
    "as shown in the recent work by @xcite , high - resolution spectroscopy to determine the rotational period can test the viability of a potential companion star .",
    "the maximum angular distance that a companion star could travel from the center of explosion in 1825 yr is 47 @xmath170 arcsec , where @xmath171 is the velocity of the companion in units of 300 km s@xmath3 .",
    "although the center of explosion is currently unknown , it should be possible to identify the companion star from a single - degenerate type ia sn .",
    "another promising possibility would be to find the light echo of rcw 86 and obtain a spectrum of the sn itself .",
