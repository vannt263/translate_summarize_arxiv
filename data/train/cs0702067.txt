    "in a companion paper , which we will refer to as paper i ( `` the haar wavelet transform of a dendrogram '' ) , a new transform is applied to a hierarchical clustering .",
    "various examples are given of uses of this transform , prior to applying the inverse transform .    in this paper",
    ", we look at linkages with other ways of understanding the wavelet transform , with the classical dmarche described in appendix 1 . our aim is to understand the wavelet transform when applied to hierarchical clustering dendrograms ( where notation and expression as ultrametric topology are summarized in appendix 2 ) .",
    "after all , both the wavelet transform and hiearchical clustering aspire to multiresolution or multiscale analysis .",
    "the natural question is then : how do they differ and are there different aspects that they bring to the data analysis task ?",
    "a good deal of recent work on wavelet transform has been through group theoretic approaches .",
    "foote et al .  ( 2000a ) point to how group theoretic understanding can lead to a `` wealth of new analysis filters '' ( in the context of multiresolution signal and image analysis ) .",
    "the same point is made by the smart project ( smart , 2005 ) , including the change to have automatic generation of new transform algorithms .",
    "believing that algorithms should be developed if and only if the there is a verifiable user need for them , we would instead point to another reason why group theoretic understanding is crucial to data analysis",
    ". a great deal of observed reality can be understood by way of observed symmetries , and groups summarized and encapsulate the properties of these symmetries . for time evolving phenomena , therefore , or spatial coordinate referenced phenomena , it may be possible to replace analysis that is time - referenced or referenced to particular coordinate systems with a more general , more generic , symmetry analysis .",
    "this is the vision opened up by the study of group actions on a set of objects .",
    "parenthically , one fascinating way as to how this works can be seen in cendra and marsden ( 2003 ) .",
    "the authors develop ( i ) an analytic theory of dynamics as functions of spatial and temporal coordinates ; and ( ii ) group theoretic interpretation of , in parts of the study , return or phase maps .",
    "our approach can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be an ultrametric space , associated with an @xmath3-dimensional embedding , @xmath4 .",
    "we note that an ultrametric space is necessarily of 0 dimenensionality ; and that minimal dimensionality real embedding of an ultrametric has been studied by lemin and others ( lemin , 2001 ; bartal et al . , 2004 ) .    the partial order of ( clopen ) set inclusion",
    "is denoted by the binary tree or hierarchy , @xmath5 .",
    "consider the group action comprising rotations or cyclic permutations ( these are equivalent ) of subnodes of any node in @xmath5 , and we will denote this group as @xmath6",
    ". then we study the wavelet transform of @xmath7 resulting from the actions of group @xmath6 .",
    "having already discussed the new wavelet transform in paper i , we can give one result relating to it in the context of the group of equivalent representations of @xmath5 as follows .",
    "_ theorem : _ for all @xmath8 equivalent representations of @xmath5 ( here : unlabeled graph isomorphisms ) , the dendrogram haar wavelet transform is unique .",
    "the proof follows from the definition of the wavelet coefficents at each level , @xmath9 ; whereas the equivalent representations of @xmath5 are intra level .",
    "it follows from this theorem that we have a unique matrix representation of a dendrogram .",
    "in this section we will review recent work using wavelet transforms on data tables , and show how our work represents a radically new approach to tackling similar objectives .",
    "approximate query processing arises when data must be kept confidential so that only aggregate or macro - level data can be divulged .",
    "approximate query processing also provides a solution to access of information from massive data tables .",
    "one approach to approximate database querying through aggregates is sampling .",
    "however a join operation applied to two uniform random samples results in a non - uniform result , which furthermore is sparse ( chakrabarti , garofalakis , rastogi and shim , 2001 ) .",
    "a second approach is to keep histograms on the coordinates . for a multidimensional feature space , one",
    "is faced with a `` curse of dimensionality '' as the dimensionality grows .",
    "a third approach is wavelet - based , and is of interest to us in this article .",
    "a form of progressive access to the data is sought , such that aggregated data can be obtained first , followed by greater refinement of the data .",
    "the haar wavelet transform is a favored transform for such purposes , given that reconstructed data at a given resolution level is simply a recursively defined mean of data values .",
    "vitter and wang ( 1999 ) consider the combinatorial aspects of data access using a haar wavelet transform , and based on a multi - way data hypercube .",
    "such data , containing scores or frequencies , is often found in the commercial data mining context of olap , on - line analytical processing .    as pointed out in chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , one can treat multidimensional feature hypercubes as a type of high dimensional image , taking the given order of feature dimensions as fixed .",
    "as an alternative a uniform `` shift and distribute '' randomization can be used ( chakrabarti et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "there are problems , however , in directly applying a wavelet transform to a data table .",
    "essentially , a relational table ( to use database terminology ; or matrix ) is treated in the same way as a 2-dimensional pixelated image , although the former case is invariant under row and column permutation , whereas the latter case is not ( murtagh , starck and berry , 2000 ) .",
    "therefore there are immediate problems related to non - uniqueness , and data order dependence .",
    "what if , however , one organizes the data such that adjacency has a meaning ?",
    "this implies that similarly - valued objects , and/or similarly - valued features , are close together .",
    "this is what we do , using any hierarchical clustering algorithm ( e.g. , the ward or minimum variance one ) . without loss of generality , as seen in these figures , we assume that a hierarchy is a binary , rooted tree ; and equivalently that the series of agglomerations involve precisely two clusters ( possibly singleton clusters ) at each of the @xmath10 agglomerations where there are @xmath11 observations .",
    "these @xmath11 observations are usually represented by @xmath11 row vectors in our data table .    a significant advantage in regard to hierarchical clustering is that partitions of the data can be read off at a succession of levels , and this obviates the need for fixing the number of clusters in advance .",
    "all possible clustering outcomes are considered .",
    "( remark : of course , relative to any one of the commonly used cluster homogeneity criteria , each partition is guaranteed to be sub - optimal at best . )",
    "in this article , we will denote the agglomeration of two clusters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as cluster @xmath14 .",
    "so ( left or right subtree ) nodes in the dendrogram are associated with the child ( elder or younger ) subnodes .",
    "we can define the elder cluster as @xmath12 such that @xmath15 , but we will _ not _ be concerned with whether or not elder corresponds to left , and younger to right .    for @xmath11 objects or observation vectors ,",
    "another notation that we can use is that the hierarchy @xmath5 is the set of clusters indexed from 1 to @xmath11 : @xmath16 .",
    "we will always assume in this article , for convenience of exposition and with little loss of generality , that for distinct clusters @xmath17 .    whenever the distinction between the following become important",
    ", we will clearly distinguish between them : clusters ; nodes ; sets of objects ; sets of indices of objects ; and p - adic number representation of indices of objects .",
    "the haar algorithm , as discussed in paper i , is as follows :    1 .",
    "take each cluster @xmath14 in turn , proceeding in sequence through @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   apply the smoothing function , @xmath19 : @xmath20 .",
    "3 .   thereby apply the detail function , @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "4 .   return to step 1 until all @xmath23 clusters are processed .    for details of how the clusters also take terminal nodes ( objects ) into account , see paper i.    now , it is clear from construction that perfect reconstruction of the input data ( alternatively expressed , perfect undoing of the foregoing haar algorithm ) is guaranteed , given all of the following : ( i ) all of the detail function values , ( ii ) the final smooth , @xmath24 , ( iii ) the definition of the dendrogram , and ( iii ) a convention of left and right subtree that allows us to traverse down the tree from @xmath14 to both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in practice",
    "our objectives are to explore the foundations of two distinct approaches .",
    "both seek a haar wavelet basis .",
    "these two approaches are as follows and can express the 2 input data cases considered in section 4.3 ( `` the input data '' ) of paper i.    * wavelet transform in an ultrametic topology : induce the haar basis from the hierarchy @xmath5 that expresses the relationships in a set of ultrametrically related points , @xmath25 .",
    "* wavelet transform on embedded subsets : induce the haar basis from the hierarchy @xmath5 defining a set of subsets of @xmath25 .",
    "in the ultrametric case , each point @xmath26 defines an @xmath3-dimensional vector : @xmath27 . for notational convenience",
    "therefore @xmath28 is either the index , or a vector .    in the set of subsets case",
    ", each point @xmath26 can be defined as an @xmath11-dimensional index vector .",
    "thus for example the sequentially second point is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "both practical cases above can be expressed as follows : we carry out a wavelet transform in @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the group of alternative representations of a given hierarchy , @xmath5 .",
    "the points @xmath26 are associated either with vectors in @xmath4 or with an orthonormal vector set in @xmath32 .",
    "( note how @xmath32 is @xmath11-dimensional , whereas @xmath4 is @xmath3-dimensional .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath25 is @xmath11 .",
    "the dimensionality of a feature or attribute space is @xmath3 . )",
    "in this section we look at the wavelet transform on discrete fields , and in particular on @xmath33 .",
    "this is realized through cyclic representations of the affine group of @xmath34 or of @xmath35 .    in wavelets",
    ", we are seeking a representation of our data which has `` covariant '' properties relative to scale : for example , for tranlation `` covariance '' , the representation of a shifted signal must be a shifted copy of the representation of the signal ( torrsani , 1994 ) . in the group theory perspective , such `` covariance '' properties ( i.e.  with respect to the action of a symmetry group ) are the starting point , and the representation is to be derived from them .",
    "the `` covariance '' group `` turns out to be isomorphic ( up to a compact factor ) to the geometric phase space of the representation '' ( torrsani , 1994 , p.  6 ) .",
    "traditionally , the wavelet transform is covariant with respect to a group action applicable to images , signals , time series , etc . ,",
    "viz .  the affine group of the real line , which is a continuous group ( antoine et al . , 2000a ) .",
    "thus a first task is to bypass the need for a continuous group .",
    "the group law of the affine group , in generic form @xmath36 , generates translations and dilations .",
    "the action of the @xmath36 group on @xmath37 means : @xmath38 .",
    "we have the following product :    @xmath39    here , the identity is : @xmath40 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath41 is : @xmath42 .",
    "this is a non - commutative lie ( and thus continuous ) group .",
    "flornes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) consider a discrete wavelet transform to begin with , specified on the hilbert space @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 are the integers , @xmath35 are integers mod @xmath0 where @xmath0 is prime for reasons explained below ; and @xmath43 implies finite energy from discrete values , or being square integrable ) .",
    "the haar measure is defined on locally compact groups , permitting integration over group actions or members ; and a locally compact separable group is consistent with the square integrable property .",
    "the group at issue here is the cyclic representation of the affine group ; or its finite analog , the affine group mod p ( foote et al . , 2000a ) .",
    "a discussion of square integrable group representations in the context of time - frequency transforms , including the continuous wavelet transform , can be found in torrsani ( 2000 ) ; and torrsani ( 1994 ) discusses the counterexample case of the rotation group , @xmath44 , on the 2-dimensional sphere , which gives rise to a representation which is not square integrable .",
    "the wavelet transform considered by flornes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) has the following operations :    @xmath45    the reason why @xmath0 has to be prime is as follows . consider the p - adic number representation of @xmath35 . for the p - adic respresentation of @xmath35 to be a field , i.e.  to have an inverse",
    ", @xmath0 must be prime .",
    "the unitary representation of a group @xmath31 is a mapping into a ( complex ) hilbert space .",
    "flornes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) define the following unitary representation , @xmath46 , on the group , mapping into unitary operations on @xmath33 :    @xmath47    in terms of the translation and dilation operators , we have :    @xmath48    thus far , a purely discrete wavelet transform is at issue .",
    "however if we take our function values @xmath49 defined on @xmath35 as sampled values from a continuous signal , then problems of interpolation arise .",
    "it simply is not good enough to transform our discrete data independently of awareness of the underlying continuum .",
    "note that this issue is at the nub of where data analysis differs from signal processing . in data analysis ,",
    "mostly a data cloud is taken as given ( potentially leading to a combinatorial perspective ) or as a stochastic realization ( leading to a statistical modeling ) . in signal processing ,",
    "the observed data are samples of an underlying topological or other continuous structure .",
    "it is a prime objective in the signal processing context to keep the processing of the observed , sampled data fully and provably consistent with the underlying continuous structures .",
    "a way to address this issue of interpolation is to use b spline filters ( the simplest example of which is the box function used by the haar wavelet transform ) to smooth the data , thereby `` filling the holes '' between gaps in the sampled values , before dilating .",
    "this is termed pseudo - dilation .",
    "relations ( [ eqntd2 ] ) can be re - expressed as follows ( torrsani , 1994 ) :    @xmath50    then the affine multiplication law is verified by @xmath51 ( using relation [ eqntd ] ) :    @xmath52    when @xmath53 with @xmath0 prime , then @xmath54 always divides @xmath11 .",
    "the affine group on @xmath33 is well - defined ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 define a representation of this group ; and it turns out that the square integrable property holds .    in general for @xmath57",
    "the  trous algorithm is used incorporating both continuously defined dilation , and discretization of the function .",
    "we could embed each node of a hierarchical clustering , defined as we always do so as binary , rooted tree , in @xmath58 .",
    "lang ( 1998 ) develops a wavelet transform approach ( including the haar wavelet transform and others ) for such a 2-series local field , or cantor dyadic group . taking each cluster @xmath59 or node in the tree individually is not satisfactory from our point of view , and so we look further for a more pleasing way to process a hierarchy .",
    "wavelet transform analysis is the determining of a `` useful '' basis for @xmath60 with the following properties :    * induced from a discrete subgroup of @xmath4 , * using translations on this subgroup , and * dilations of the basis functions .",
    "classically ( frazier , 1999 ; debnath and mikusiski , 1999 ; strang and nguyen , 1996 ) the wavelet transform avails of a wavelet function @xmath61 , where the latter is the space of all square integrable functions .",
    "wavelet transforms are bases on @xmath60 , and the discrete lattice subgroup @xmath62 is used to allow discrete groups of dilated translation operators to be induced on @xmath4 .",
    "discrete lattice subgroups are typical of 2d images ( the lattice is a pixelated grid ) or 3d images ( the lattice is the voxelated grid ) or spectra or time series ( the lattice is the set of time steps , or wavelength steps ) .    sometimes it is appropriate to consider the construction of wavelet bases on @xmath30 where @xmath31 is some group other than @xmath37 . in foote ,",
    "mirchandani , rockmore , healy and olson ( 2000a , 2000b ; see also foote , 2005 ) this is done for the group defined by a quadtree , in turn derived from a 2d image . to consider the wavelet",
    "transform approach not in a hilbert space but rather in locally - defined and discrete spaces we have to change the specification of a wavelet function in @xmath63 and instead use @xmath30 .",
    "benedetto ( 2004 ) and benedetto and benedetto ( 2004 ) considered in detail the group @xmath31 as a locally compact abelian group .",
    "analogous to the integer grid , @xmath62 , a compact subgroup is used to allow a discrete group of operators to be defined on @xmath30 .",
    "the property of locally compact ( essentially : finite and free of edges ) abelian ( viz .",
    ", commutative ) groups that is most important is the existence of the haar measure ( ward , 1994 ) .",
    "the haar measure allows integration , and definition of a topology on the algebraic structure of the group .",
    "benedetto ( 2004 ) considers the following cases , among others , of wavelet bases constructed via a sub - structure :    * wavelet basis on @xmath60 using translation operators defined on the discrete lattice , @xmath62 .",
    "this is the situation discussed above , which holds for image processing , signal processing , most time series analysis ( i.e. , with equal length time steps ) , spectral signal processing , and so on .",
    "as pointed out by foote ( 2005 ) , this framework allows the multiresolution analysis in @xmath60 to be generalized to @xmath64 for minkowski metric @xmath65 other than euclidean @xmath66 . * wavelet basis on @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the p - adic field , using a discrete set of translation operators .",
    "this case has been studied by kozyref , 2002 , 2004 ; altaisky , 2004 , 2005 .",
    "see also the interesting overview of khrennikov and kozyref ( 2006 ) . * wavelet basis on @xmath67 using translation operators defined on the compact , open subgroup @xmath35 .",
    "( it is interesting to note that @xmath62 is discrete ; and that the quotient @xmath69 is compact .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath35 is compact ; and the quotient @xmath70 is discrete . ) * discussed is a wavelet basis on @xmath30 , for a group @xmath31 , using translation operators defined on a discrete subgroup , or discrete lattice . * finally",
    "the central theme of benedetto ( 2004 ) is a wavelet basis on @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a locally compact abelian group , using translation operators defined on a compact open subgroup ( or operators that can be used as such on a compact open subgroup ) ; and with definition of an expansive automorphism replacing the traditional use of dilation .    a motivation for the work of benedetto ( 2004 ) and benedetto and benedetto ( 2004 ) is laying the groundwork for the wavelet transform on the adelic numbers ( see appendix 3 ) .",
    "in this work we are content to be less ambitious in regard to number systems  below we focus on a particular p - adic encoding of dendrograms ; and we are also less ambitious in regard to wavelet functions  staying resolutely with the haar wavelet in this work . our motivation is due to our application drivers .",
    "locally compact abelian groups ( lcag ) are a way to take fourier analysis ( hence a particularly important class of harmonic analysis because so versatile ) into more general settings than e.g.  the reals ( although the reals also form a non - compact , but locally compact , abelian group ) .",
    "the duals of members of a locally compact abelian group , defined as unitary multiplicative characters , @xmath71 , also form a locally compact abelian group ( knapp , 1996 ) . the duality pairing @xmath31 and @xmath72 allows for an isometry between @xmath30 and @xmath73 ( antoine et al .",
    ", 2000 ) .",
    "fourier analysis is the study of real square integrable functions that are invariant under the group of integer translations ( see foote et al . , 2000a ) , while abstract harmonic analysis is the study of functions on more general topological groups that are invariant under a ( closed ) subgroup .",
    "it is interesting to compare some global properties of our approach relative to the fourier transform approach applied to decision trees in kargupta and park ( 2004 ) .",
    "the fourier transform lends itself well to a frequency spectrum analysis of binary decision vectors , and the latter can be of importance for supervised classification . on the other hand",
    ", our work makes use of binary trees but in the framework of unsupervised classification .",
    "the wavelet transform shares with the fourier transform the property that frequency spectral information is determined from the data ; and the wavelet transform additionally determines spatial or resolution scale information from the data .",
    "we have found the wavelet transform , as described in this article , to be appropriate for the type of input data that we have considered . in general terms , both we in this work , and kargupta and park ( 2004 ) , have as objectives the filtering and compression of data .",
    "we need affine group action for the wavelet transform , and we have seen above ( section [ discrete ] , `` wavelet transform on discrete fields '' ) that @xmath35 affords us this ; but for an arbitrary discrete field , and for an arbitrary locally compact abelian group , it is tricky to find an affine group .",
    "taking further the flornes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) work , antoine et al .",
    "( 2000 ) consider an infinite locally compact abelian group , @xmath74 ; the restriction of @xmath74 to a lattice @xmath75 ; @xmath76 , an abelian semigroup ; and the actions of @xmath76 on @xmath77 .",
    "based on a pseudodilation ( i.e. , the product of a natural dilation by a convolution operator ) the case of a continuous underlying signal is studied , i.e.  the relation between the semigroup acting on @xmath77 , and a continuous affine group acting on @xmath63 .",
    "spline functions are again among the wavelet functions used ( among which is the haar wavelet function associated with the b - spline of order 1 ) .",
    "the aspect of greatest interest to us here in the approach of benedetto ( 2004 ) , and benedetto and benedetto ( 2004 ) , is to define wavelets on @xmath30 , with @xmath31 taken as the p - adic rationals , @xmath68 , and with the p - adic integers , @xmath35 , on which we define translation - like operators .",
    "firstly , we are using therefore @xmath67 , i.e.   functions defined on the rationals .",
    "secondly , we use a discrete group of operators on @xmath67 which are not in themselves translation operators , but may be used in an analogous way .",
    "the `` trick '' used is that the quotient @xmath78 is discrete , and this will furnish the translation operators .",
    "an expansive automorphism is also needed in this context , i.e.  what we use in analogy with dilation .    a number of alternatives for the subset of @xmath78 ( more strictly the quotient of the group dual by the annhilator in the dual of the compact open subgroup ) are discussed by benedetto ( 2000a ) . given our application - driven interest ,",
    "we will not pursue them further here .",
    "what we will do , however , is to look at how the group - based approach of benedetto ( 2000a ) , that for the most part assumes infinite sets , can be tailored for our algorithmic  hence finite  purposes .",
    "we will therefore look at how we can suitably encode any given dendrogram in terms of @xmath68  or indeed , as will be seen , in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "next we will move on to look at how a lattice - proxy is defined on our encoding , and thereby translation operators .",
    "finally , we will look at how an expansive automorphism can be replaced by expansive mapping in the finite and discrete case .    in all of this",
    ", we follow the methodology described by benedetto ( 2000a ) ; but we restrict all aspects to the finite , discrete context .      for the group actions , with respect to which we will seek invariance",
    ", we consider independent cyclic shifts of the subnodes of a given node ( hence , at each level ) .",
    "equivalently these actions are adjancency preserving permutations of subnodes of a given node ( i.e. , for given @xmath12 , the permutations of @xmath79 . due to the binary tree , or strictly pairwise agglomerations represented by the hierarchy",
    ", the `` adjacency '' property is trivial .",
    "we have therefore cyclic group actions at each node , where the cyclic group is of order 2 .",
    "the symmetries of @xmath5 are given by structured permutations of the terminals .",
    "the terminals will be denoted here by term @xmath5 .",
    "the full group of symmetries is summarized by the following algorithm :    1 .   for level @xmath80",
    "down to 1 do : 2 .   selected node , @xmath81 node at level @xmath82 .",
    "3 .   and permute subnodes of @xmath9 .",
    "subnode @xmath9 is the root of subtree @xmath83 .",
    "we denote @xmath84 simply by @xmath5 . for a subnode @xmath85 undergoing a relocation action in step 3 ,",
    "the internal structure of subtree @xmath86 is not altered .",
    "the algorithm described defines the automorphism group which is a wreath product of the symmetric group .",
    "denote the permutation at level @xmath9 by @xmath87 .",
    "then the automorphism group is given by : @xmath88 where wr denotes the wreath product .",
    "call term @xmath83 the terminals that descend from the node at level @xmath9 .",
    "so these are the terminals of the subtree @xmath83 with its root node at level @xmath9 .",
    "we can alternatively call term @xmath83 the cluster associated with level @xmath9 .",
    "we will now look at shift invariance under the group action .",
    "this amounts to the requirement for a constant function defined on term @xmath89 . a convenient way to do",
    "this is to define such a function on the set term @xmath83 via the root node alone , @xmath9 . by definition",
    "then we have a constant function on the set term @xmath83 .",
    "let us call @xmath90 a space of functions that are constant on term @xmath83 .",
    "possible bases of @xmath90 that were considered in paper i are :    1 .   basis vector with @xmath91 components , with 0 values except for value 1 for component @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   set ( of cardinality @xmath92 ) of @xmath3-dimensional observation vectors .",
    "the constant function maps @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the space of complex valued functions on the set term @xmath5 .",
    "now we consider the resolution scheme arising from moving from + @xmath95 to @xmath96 . from the hierarchical clustering point of view",
    "it is clear what this represents : simply , an agglomeration of two clusters called term @xmath86 and term @xmath97 , replacing them with a new cluster , term @xmath83 .",
    "let the spaces of constant functions corresponding to the two cluster agglomerands be denoted @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these two clusters are disjoint initially , which motivates us taking the two spaces as a couple : @xmath100 . in the same way ,",
    "let the space of constant functions corresponding to node @xmath9 be denoted @xmath90 .",
    "the multiresolution scheme uses a space of zero mean denoted @xmath101 with mean defined on the couple of spaces , @xmath100 :    @xmath102    in considering spaces of constant functions , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we know that the support of these spaces are , respectively , term @xmath103 and term @xmath97 .",
    "so if , instead of the space of zero mean denoted @xmath101 where mean is defined on the couple of spaces , @xmath100 , we considered the mean of the combined support , term @xmath104 term @xmath97 , then the result would be quite different .",
    "we would , in fact , have a cluster - weighted mean value .",
    "let us exemplify a case that satisfies all that has been defined in the context of the wreath product invariance that we are targeting .",
    "it also exemplifies the algorithm discussed in depth in paper i. take the constant function on @xmath98 to be @xmath105 .",
    "take the constant function on @xmath99 to be @xmath106 .",
    "then define the constant function on @xmath107 to be @xmath108 .",
    "next define the zero mean function on @xmath101 to be :    @xmath109 in the support interval of @xmath98 , i.e.  term @xmath86 , and @xmath110 in the support interval of @xmath99 , i.e.  term @xmath97 .",

    "when we consider agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms it is clear that ( i ) clusters are often defined in terms of center of gravity , or mean ; and ( ii ) this allows for defining a ( vector ) difference term between a cluster and its immediate sub - clusters .",

    "the novelty of our work resides in two areas : ( i ) we have shown the close association between two classes of multiple resolution data analysis approaches , agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms and the wavelet transform ; and ( ii ) our motivation is not at all to construct hierarchical clusterings in a new way but rather to illuminate further inherent ultrametric properties of data ( cf .",

    "the wavelet transform algorithm described previously is then directly applied .",
    "we now look at other related work .    in khrennikov and kozyrev ( 2004 ) and kozyrev ( 2001 )",
    "the haar wavelet transform , defined on binary trees , was also introduced and discussed .",
    "compared to the notation used here , the descriptions are related though a p - adic change of variable ( viz .",
    ", @xmath295 is mapped onto @xmath296 . )    for the @xmath1 case , a convenient notational expression is given by the vladimirov operator ( see avetisov , bikulov , kozyrev and osipov , 2002 ) which is a modified differentiation operator .",
    "the vladimirov operator is a p - adically expressed derivative for an ultrametric space with _ linearly _ related hierarchical levels , @xmath9 . in kozyrev ( 2001 , 2003 ) it is shown how the eigenvalues of the vladimirov operator are the haar wavelets . as a consequence ,",
    "the hierarchical haar wavelet transform is a spectral analysis of the vladimorov operator .",
    "our work differs from the works cited in the following way .",
    "firstly , these other works deal with regular @xmath0-way trees .",
    "degeneracies are allowed , which can cater for the irregular @xmath0-way trees that we have considered .",
    "we have preferred to directly address the dendrogram data structure , given that it models observed data well .",
    "secondly , these other works cater for infinite trees .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a more curtailed problem , with the aim of having a straightforward implementation , and with the aim of targeting the analysis of practical , constructive data analysis problems .",
    "we have also been more focused in this work compared to the general setting described in comprehensive depth by benedetto and benedetto ( 2004 ) .",
    "an important reason for considering dendrograms rather than infinite regular trees is that the former setting gives rise to ( low order ) polynomially bound algorithms for all operations ; whereas the latter , in the general case , are not polynomially bound .",
    "a final path for future work will be noted .",
    "the haar wavelet transform on a dendrogram ( @xmath5 ) gives us information on the rate of change of the clusters ( @xmath12 ) , with respect to the level index of each cluster ( @xmath9 ) . in a sense",
    "this haar wavelet transform is the derivative of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath9 .",

    "the question then arises as to whether any one of p = 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , @xmath332 can be preferred . for want of justification to limit attention to one or a few values of p , taking them all gives rise to the adelic number system ( brekke and freund , 1993 ) .",
