    "in 2012 , the lhc discovered a new particle with the mass of 126  gev  @xcite .",
    "the particle is regarded as the higgs boson predicted in the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson means that all the particle contents in the sm are completed .",
    "the lhc is now searching for indications of new physics , and is trying to measure the deviation in the coupling from the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmic observations such as the experiments at wmap and planck have reported the new results  @xcite .",
    "these experiments measure the temperature fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background precisely , by which we can impose constraints on the models of inflation . cosmic inflation at the early universe  @xcite , which is a promising candidate to solve cosmological problems such as the horizon problem and the flatness problem , requires an additional scalar boson , the inflaton .",
    "we consider the higgs inflation scenario where the higgs boson plays a role of the inflaton . in the minimal model of this scenario",
    "@xcite , we do not have to introduce any other particle in addition to the particle contents in the sm to explain an inflation .",
    "however , it would be difficult to realize the higgs inflation scenario in the minimal model .",
    "assuming the sm with one higgs doublet , the vacuum stability argument indicates that the model can be well defined only below the energy scale where the running coupling of the higgs self - coupling becomes zero . for the higgs boson mass to be 126  gev with the top quark mass to be 173.1  gev and for the coupling for the strong force to be @xmath0 0.1184 ,",
    "the critical energy scale is estimated to be around @xmath1  gev using the nnlo calculation , although the uncertainty due to the values of the top quark mass and @xmath2 is not small  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum seems to be metastable when we assume that the model holds up to the planck scale .",
    "this kind of analysis gives a strong constraint on the scenario of the higgs inflation , because the inflation occurs at the energy scale where the vacuum stability is not guaranteed in the sm .",
    "recently , a viable model for the higgs inflation has been proposed , in which the higgs sector is extended including an additional scalar field  @xcite .",
    "there is also another problem in the minimal model , which comes from unitarity argument  @xcite .    extending the higgs sector from the sm one",
    ", we may expect to reveal new physics that can explain phenomena such as neutrino oscillation , existence of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe . here , we extend the higgs inflation model in the framework of a radiative seesaw scenario by e.  ma  @xcite .",
    "the radiative seesaw scenario is a way to explain tiny neutrino masses , where they are radiatively induced at the loop level by introducing @xmath3-odd scalar fields and @xmath3-odd right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "an interesting characteristic feature in these radiative seesaw models is that dark matter candidates automatically enter into the model because of the @xmath3 parity .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss a simple model to explain inflation , neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously , which is based on the simplest radiative seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "both the higgs boson and neutral components of the @xmath3-odd scalar doublet can satisfy conditions on the slow - roll inflation  @xcite and vacuum stability up to the inflation scale .",
    "we find that a part of the parameter region where these scalar fields can play a role of the inflaton is compatible with the current lhc results , the current data from neutrino experiments and those of the dark matter abundance as well as the direct search  @xcite . a phenomenological consequence of scenario results in a specific mass spectrum of scalar fields , which can be tested at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "we extend the higgs inflation model in the framework of a radiative seesaw scenario  @xcite . in this model , there are the @xmath3-odd scalar doublet field @xmath4 and right - handed neutrino @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath3-even sm higgs doublet field @xmath6 due to the invariance under the unbroken discrete @xmath3 symmetry  @xcite . because dirac yukawa couplings of neutrinos are forbidden by the @xmath3 symmetry , the yukawa interaction for leptons is given by @xmath7 (",
    "the superscript @xmath8 denotes the charge conjugation ) .",
    "the scalar potential is given by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10(@xmath11  gev ) is the planck scale , and @xmath12 is the ricci scalar .",
    "then , these quartic coupling constants should satisfy the following constraints on the unbounded - from - below conditions at the tree level ; @xmath13 and we impose the conditions of triviality ; @xmath14    assuming @xmath150 and @xmath16 0 , @xmath6 obtains the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , while @xmath4 can not get the vev because of the unbroken @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the lightest @xmath3-odd particle is stabilized by the @xmath3 parity , and it can act as the dark matter as long as it is electrically neutral .",
    "mass eigenstates of the scalar bosons are the sm - like @xmath3-even higgs scalar boson ( @xmath19 ) , the @xmath3-odd cp - even scalar boson ( @xmath20 ) , the @xmath3-odd cp - odd scalar boson ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath3-odd charged scalar bosons ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "masses of these scalar bosons are given by  @xcite ; @xmath23 .",
    "for the higgs inflation scenario in our model defined in the previous section , there are nine parameters in the scalar sector ; i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they must satisfy the vacuum stability condition on the running of the scalar coupling constants and the constraint from the slow - roll inflation , the dark matter data and the neutrino data .",
    "we find that a part of parameter regions is compatible with all constraints .",
    "then , we can get the possible mass spectrum for additional scalar bosons in our model  @xcite .",
    "first , we discuss the constraint from the slow - roll inflation . in order that some of the scalar bosons play a role of the inflaton",
    ", we need to impose following conditions  @xcite ; @xmath33 parameters in the scalar potential should satisfy the constraint from the power spectrum  @xcite ; @xmath34 where @xmath35 is given as @xmath36 . when the scalar potential satisfies the conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vs2 ] ) and ( [ eq : l5 ] ) , the model could realize the inflation .",
    "second , we discuss the constraint from dark matter .",
    "we here assume that the cp - odd boson @xmath21 is the dark matter ( the lightest @xmath3-odd particle ) . when @xmath32 is very small such as @xmath37 , @xmath21 is difficult to act as the dark matter because the scattering process @xmath38",
    "( @xmath39 is a nucleon ) opens and the cross section can not be consistent with the current direct search results for dark matter  @xcite . to avoid the process @xmath38 kinematically , we here take @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the inflation scale . with this choice ,",
    "masses of @xmath21 and @xmath20 are almost the same value .",
    "the co - annihilation process @xmath42 via the @xmath43 boson is important to explain the abundance of the dark matter where @xmath44 is a particle in the sm , because the pair annihilation process @xmath45 via the @xmath19 boson is suppressed due to the constraint from the inflation .",
    "because the cross section of @xmath42 depends only on the mass of the dark matter , the mass of the dark matter @xmath21 is constrained from the abundance of the dark matter as @xmath46 , where we have used the nine years wmap data  @xcite .",
    "third , we can explain tiny neutrino masses in this model which are generated by the one loop diagram  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass is related to @xmath32 and masses of scalar bosons ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , which are constrained from the inflation and the dark matter . from the relation @xmath49",
    "gev@xmath50 where @xmath51 is the majorana mass of @xmath52 ( @xmath53=1 - 3 ) and @xmath54 is neutrino yukawa coupling constant , the magnitude of tiny neutrino masses can be explained .",
    "for example , when @xmath51 is @xmath55  tev , @xmath54 is @xmath56 .",
    "captypetable    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we calculate the running of the coupling constants using the renormalization group equations  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig : run ] , for the contribution of additional scalar bosons , this model can be stable up to the inflation scale from the electroweak scale  @xcite . as numerical input parameters , we take the vev ( @xmath57gev ) , sm - like higgs mass ( @xmath58  gev ) and the allowed value for the dark matter mass ( @xmath59  gev ) .",
    "further numerical input parameter comes from the perturbativity of @xmath29 up to the inflation scale ; i.e. , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the inflation scale @xmath62  gev .",
    "the parameter set in table  [ table : lambda ] can be consistent with these numerical inputs and the constraints are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vs])-([eq : ft ] ) .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the mass spectrum of the scalar bosons in our model as @xmath63 where the mass difference between @xmath21 and @xmath20 is about 500  kev .",
    "the mass spectrum is not largely changed even if @xmath48 is varied with in its allowed region . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the constraints on our model from the existing experiments and the way to test the characteristic mass spectrum in this model at the future collider experiment .",
    "the lep experiment constrains masses of the @xmath3-odd scalar bosons . the mass of charged scalar bosons @xmath64 should be lager than 70 - 90  gev by the lep  @xcite . this constraint is satisfied in our model ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 should be larger than @xmath67 , and the combination of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is bounded by @xmath20@xmath21 production by the lep date  @xcite . however , when @xmath70  gev , masses of neutral @xmath3-odd scalar boson loop diagrams are not really constrained by the lep  @xcite . on the other hand , the contributions to the electroweak parameters  @xcite from additional scalar bosons loops which are given by  @xcite are also consistent with the electroweak precision data with 90% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , we consider the way to test at the lhc . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , they conclude that it could be difficult to test @xmath71 processes because the cross sections of the background processes are very large .",
    "the process of @xmath72 could be tested with about the 3@xmath73 c.l . with the various benchmark points for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , it would be difficult to test @xmath72 in our scenario , because @xmath75 and @xmath74 are almost degenerate in our scenario , and the event number of @xmath72 is negligibly small after imposing the basic cuts  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the total decay width of @xmath20 is about @xmath76  gev , @xmath20 would pass through the detector .",
    "therefore , this signal is also difficult to be detected at the lhc .",
    "finally , we discuss the signals of @xmath77 and @xmath22 at the ilc with @xmath78  gev . in the following , we use calchep  2.5.6 for numerical evaluation  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the @xmath22 pair production process : @xmath79 ( @xmath80 denotes a hadron jet )  @xcite . because of the kinematical reason",
    ", the energy of the two - jet system @xmath81 satisfies the following equation ; @xmath82 in our parameter set , the distribution of @xmath81 for the differential cross section in this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ejj ] .    the important background processes against this process , which are @xmath83 and @xmath84 with a missing @xmath85 event ,",
    "could be well reduced by imposing an appropriate kinematic cuts .",
    "then , we expect that @xmath86 and @xmath74 can be measured by using the endpoints of @xmath81 at the ilc after the background reduction .",
    "on the other hand , we consider @xmath87 production : @xmath88 at the ilc .",
    "if the mass difference between @xmath74 and @xmath75 is sizable , it could also be detected by using the endpoint of @xmath81 .",
    "however , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are almost degenerate in our scenario .",
    "when we detect @xmath22 but we can not detect the clue of this process at the ilc , it seems that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are almost same value .",
    "we have studied the higgs inflation model in the framework of a radiative seesaw scenario . in our model",
    ", we may be able to explain inflation , neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously .",
    "we find that a part of parameter regions is compatible with all constraints which come from the conditions of the slow - roll inflation , the current lhc results , the current data from neutrino experiments and those of the dark matter abundance as well as the direct search results .",
    "we can test this scenario by measuring masses of scalar bosons at the ilc with @xmath78  gev .",
