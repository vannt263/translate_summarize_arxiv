    "a homogeneous nonlinear system may admit a localized solutions with a natural frequency residing in the first ( semi - infinite ) band - gap of the corresponding linear system . when there is a periodic non - uniformity in the linear system , additional finite band - gaps will be formed and the nonlinear system will admit a novel type of solitons known as the gap solitons @xcite .",
    "one main characteristic of a gap soliton is the infinitely many number of zeros in the profile of the solution , inheriting a characteristic of bloch waves .",
    "gap solitons are intensively studied among others in nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "several reports on the experimental observation of gap solitons in the fields in the one - dimensional setting are , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "depending on particular underlying assumptions and specific limits , gap solitons have been studied analytically through several different approaches .",
    "the first theoretical approach is through the coupled - mode theory , which is based on a decomposition of the wave field into a forward and backward propagating wave @xcite .",
    "the applicability and justification of the method can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the stability of gap solitons in this approach have been studied analytically in @xcite . the second formal approximation to",
    "gap soliton is through the so - called tight - binding approximation , which leads to a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite . in this approach",
    ", a gap soliton can be related to the ordinary soliton through the so - called staggering transformation . the existence and",
    "the stability of discrete solitons in the uncoupled limit of this approach has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the third analysis of gap solitons is based on the approximation when the eigenfrequency of the localized modes is close to one of the edges of the finite band gaps @xcite . in this case , the envelope of the gap solitons is described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation . it is shown in @xcite that gap solitons at least suffer from an oscillatory instability because gap solitons possess internal modes .",
    "relatively recently , another analytical method was proposed by kominis et al .",
    "@xcite , employing a phase space method for the construction of an analytical solitary wave .",
    "even though the method is rather limited to piecewise - constant coefficients , it was shown that the method is effective in obtaining various types of localized modes belonging to gap solitons .",
    "for that new method , the stability result was so far only obtained through numerical simulations .",
    "the phase - space method proposed in @xcite is similar to that used in our recent work @xcite , where it was shown that the profile of a solution in the phase - space can be used to describe its instability .",
    "the method was based on the topological argument developed in @xcite . here , we propose to apply a similar method to determine the stability of gap solitons obtained through the phase - space method @xcite . despite the similarity in the proposed method in investigating the instability of gap solitons , the problem is nontrivial . the topological argument in @xcite is so far immediately applicable to nonlinear systems with finite inhomogeneity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . by specifically constructing the solutions ,",
    "we show that the argument is also useful to study gap solitons .",
    "in addition to inhomogeneities occupying the infinite domain , the so - called surface gap solitons sitting at the interface between inhomogeneities in the semi - infinite domain and a homogeneous region @xcite will also be studied .",
    "our result will complement the numerical results on the stability of surface gap solitons recently studied , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as the following . in section 2 ,",
    "the governing equations are discussed and the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem is derived . the construction of gap solitons using the phase - space method is briefly explained .",
    "the instability of gap solitons is studied analytically in section 3 using the topological argument . in section 4 ,",
    "the linear eigenvalue problem for several gap solitons is solved numerically , where an agreement between the analytical results presented in the previous section is obtained . in the same section ,",
    "the instability of surface gap solitons is also discussed .",
    "we conclude the paper in section 5 .",
    "we consider the following governing system of differential equations @xmath0 where the ` outer ' equation has focusing type nonlinearity , the ` inner ' equation can be defocusing ( @xmath1 ) or linear ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath3 are disjoint sets of intervals to be specified later .    to study standing waves of ( [ gov1 ] ) , we pass to a rotating frame and consider solutions of the form @xmath4 .",
    "we then have @xmath5 standing wave solutions of ( [ gov1 ] ) will be steady - state solutions to ( [ gov2 ] ) .",
    "we consider real , @xmath6 independent solutions @xmath7 to the ode : @xmath8 to obtain solutions that decay to 0 as @xmath9 , the condition that @xmath10 is required , with @xmath11 .",
    "we will also require that @xmath12 as @xmath9 . to establish the instability of a standing wave solution we linearize ( [ gov2 ] ) about a solution to ( [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath13 and retaining terms linear in @xmath14 leads to the eigenvalue problem @xmath15 where the linear operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined as @xmath18 it is then clear that the presence of an eigenvalue of @xmath19 with positive real part implies instability .    in @xcite",
    "a gap soliton was constructed via a method of superimposing the phase portraits of the ` outer ' system : @xmath20 and the ` inner ' one : @xmath21 we can view the composite picture as a single , non - autonomous system with phase plane given by : @xmath22    in the phase plane of ( [ eq : outer ] ) , the outer system admits a soliton solution , given by the equation : @xmath23 while solution curves of the inner system are given by @xmath24 the inner system ( [ eq : inner ] ) admits a heteroclinic orbit in the phase plane given by @xmath25 .",
    "the solutions we are interested in will travel in the phase plane along the homoclinic orbit of the outer system described by ( [ eq : homo ] ) and then ` flip ' to the inner system as @xmath26 passes through @xmath27 , and then ` flip ' back to the outer system along the homoclinic orbit , repeating the process for each of the components of @xmath27 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath28 be the collection of intervals @xmath29 . in the case of a gap soliton , @xmath30 , and we have that the number of components of @xmath27 is infinite and the @xmath31 are chosen so that the soliton travels from @xmath32 along the inner system to @xmath33 .",
    "this is a key ingredient in the construction of the soliton , and will play a large role in establishing instability . in @xcite ,",
    "the inner system is linear , and the length of the interval @xmath34 can be determined as @xmath35 . here",
    ", we do not require that the inner system be linear , however we do require that the @xmath31 be chosen so that if @xmath36 , the soliton travels from @xmath32 on the homoclinic orbit along the inner system to @xmath37 , which is also on the homoclinic orbit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gapsoliton ] , we plot an example of a gap soliton of the governing equation ( [ gov1 ] ) for parameter values that will be explained in section [ numeric ] .",
    "one can notice the main characteristic of gap solitons in the plot , which is the infinitely many zeros in the soliton profile .",
    "to show instability of the standing waves , we will show that the matrix @xmath19 from above has a real positive eigenvalue .",
    "this is done by applying the main theorem of @xcite . in @xcite , systems like ( [ gov1 ] ) were considered with @xmath38 , for some real number @xmath39 .",
    "one can show that the following quantities are well defined ( see for example @xcite , and the references therein ) : @xmath40 we then have the following :    if @xmath41 there is a real positive eigenvalue of the operator @xmath19 .",
    "[ th : ckrtj88 ]    from sturm - liouville theory , @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be determined by considering solutions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "in fact , they are the number of zeros of the associated solution @xmath46 .",
    "notice that @xmath45 is actually satisfied by the standing wave itself , and that @xmath44 is the equation of variations of the standing wave equation .",
    "it follows that : @xmath47    for gap solitons , it is not immediately clear how to apply theorem [ th : ckrtj88 ] above as in this case , both , @xmath42 and @xmath48 .",
    "the idea presented in this paper is to build an approximation to a gap soliton using more and more intervals of @xmath27 for which the quantity @xmath49 remains constant . to this end",
    "define @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 adds two more components for each @xmath54 .",
    "then we can define @xmath55 , and we let @xmath56 be a solution to the ode @xmath57 thus for example @xmath58 would be the solution to @xmath59 while @xmath60 would be a solution to @xmath61 a gap soliton then can be realized as the limit of successive @xmath56 s ( in a variety of norms , but in particular in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 norms ) . in figure [ fig : successivegapsolitons ] we present a plot of @xmath56 , @xmath64 , approximating the gap soliton in figure [ fig : gapsoliton ] .",
    "we have the following theorem    [ th : main ] the quantity @xmath49 is the same for all @xmath65 described above .",
    "thus if @xmath58 is unstable then so is @xmath56 for all @xmath54 .",
    "further , if @xmath58 is unstable , then so is @xmath66 , the gap soliton , corresponding to the limit .    the key idea is to use the interpretation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 given in ( [ eq : pandq ] ) as the number of zeros of the solution @xmath66 and the number of zeros of the solution to the variational equation along @xmath66 , for the partial solution defined on @xmath67 , to the ode below : @xmath68    ) .",
    "the points @xmath69 correspond to the points @xmath70 in the phase plane . ]",
    "the number @xmath43 is straight forward to calculate .",
    "we make the geometric observation as in @xcite that @xmath42 , the number of zeros of a solution to the equation of variations along @xmath66 , can be found by determining the number of times that a vector must pass through the vertical as the base point ranges over the entire orbit .",
    "it turns out that for the solution of ( [ stat5 ] ) defined above , the rotation of a vector by the equation of variations is the same ( mod @xmath71 as if the base point had traveled along only the outer homoclinic orbit .",
    "[ ex : lin ] to better illustrate this last point , we first consider the case when both the inner system and the outer systems are linear .",
    "that is we have the following systems of linear , constant coefficient equations @xmath72 the solution to the above equation can be written explicitly .",
    "further , because we are in the linear case , we have that the equation of variations along a solution is the same as the equation itself ( [ eq : outersim ] [ eq : innersim ] ) .    being led by the geometry of the phase plane , we let @xmath73 denote a fundamental solution matrix to the equation of variations of the outer system of equations ( [ eq : outersim ] ) along a solution to ( [ eq : outersim ] ) which travels from point @xmath74 to point @xmath75 in the phase plane .",
    "that is let @xmath76 be a solution to ( [ eq : outersim ] ) , considered on the interval @xmath77 . then set @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and define @xmath73 to be a fundamental solution matrix of the equation of variations to the outer system , along the path @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath82 be a fundamental solution matrix to the equation of variations of the inner system ( [ eq : innersim ] ) , along a solution to ( [ eq : innersim ] ) evolving from point @xmath74 to point @xmath75 .",
    "we denote by @xmath83 , the points in the phase plane of ( [ eq : outersim ] , [ eq : innersim ] ) where the solutions switches between the two systems , and @xmath84 the point where we stop evolving ( see figure [ fig : gapdetour ] ) , and we let @xmath85 be a pair of initial conditions in the tangent plane to @xmath86 at the point @xmath87 .",
    "we have that a solution to the equation of variations along the orbit from @xmath87 to @xmath88 to @xmath89 to @xmath90 to @xmath84 can be described as @xmath91 it turns out that modulo @xmath92 , @xmath93 the equality in equation ( [ eq : rotid ] ) can be verified by solving the appropriate systems .",
    "another way to see the effect is to consider the following .",
    "as the base point evolves under equation ( [ eq : outersim ] [ eq : innersim ] ) from @xmath69 to @xmath94 , we can consider the aggregate effect of a @xmath95 on a tangent vector @xmath85 , as a linear map from @xmath96 , by simply determining where a tangent vector to @xmath69 gets sent to , when the base point is at @xmath94 .",
    "that is we are considering @xmath97 as a map between the tangent plane of @xmath86 at the point @xmath69 to the tangent plane of @xmath86 at the point @xmath94 .",
    "this will give us the total rotation of a tangent vector modulo @xmath92 as we travel from point @xmath69 to point @xmath94 along the orbit .",
    "the key observation is to realize that for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , this will be negative the identity @xmath100 . that is , viewing @xmath101 as a map between tangent spaces of @xmath86 , @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , by considering @xmath104 in this way , we are just measuring the effect of rotation by @xmath104 on an initial tangent vector modulo @xmath92 , and we have that @xmath105 where the last equality follows from the facts that @xmath106 , @xmath107 , the outer system of equations ( [ eq : outersim ] ) is symmetric about the origin , and the group property of variational flows .",
    "we are now ready to state the main lemma used in the proof of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "[ lem : main ] redefine @xmath73 and @xmath82 as in the above example , but instead of using the linear ode , let them be the fundamental solution matrices to the equations of variations along solutions to the inner and outer systems given in the nonlinear equation ( [ stat5 ] ) : @xmath108 likewise , let @xmath109 be defined analogously for the points in the phase plane of the nonlinear equation where the orbit switches between the inner and outer systems .",
    "also , let @xmath110 be an initial condition to the equation of variations along a solution to ( [ stat5 ] ) in the tangent plane to @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "then we have the following : @xmath111    the exact same reasoning can be used to prove lemma [ lem : main ] ( the nonlinear case ) , as was used in the example ( the linear case ) .",
    "the only difference is that in order to determine the aggregate effect of the inner system on an initial tangent vector some more care must be taken with the matrices @xmath112 .",
    "write the equation of variations to the outer system as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the equation satisfying the outer system with @xmath115 .",
    "write the equation of variations of the inner system as @xmath116 where @xmath117 satisfies the appropriate conditions for the orbit .",
    "now here is where the appropriate choices of the @xmath118 s must come into play . in the linear case ,",
    "the @xmath118 s were chosen so that the length of an interval in @xmath27 was @xmath119 . here",
    "we choose the @xmath118 s in @xmath27 so that the length of an interval is such that we will return not only to the homoclinic orbit , but also if we leave the homoclinic orbit at the point @xmath32 , we will return to the homoclinic orbit at the point @xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to determine the effect of the rotation ( modulo @xmath120 ) by the flow associated to the equation of variations along the partial orbit @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , we claim that the exact same is true as in the linear case . if @xmath122 is the linear map from the tangent space at @xmath87 and at @xmath89 to the tangent spaces at @xmath123 respectively , then @xmath124 . to see this",
    "we will write out @xmath122 in a suitable basis @xmath125 of the tangent space at @xmath87 . one obvious choice of a basis vector is the tangent vector to the inner system .",
    "however given equation ( [ eq : innersys ] ) , and the fact that along an orbit @xmath126 , this means that if @xmath127 is the vector tangent to the inner orbit at @xmath87 ( or @xmath89 ) , then under @xmath122 @xmath128 .",
    "this means that @xmath122 has the form : @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the coefficients of the linear combination of @xmath131 and a suitably chosen @xmath132 .",
    "now we appeal to two facts about the matrix @xmath122 which are evident from it s definition .",
    "the first is that @xmath122 must be orientation preserving .",
    "this is an elementary consequence due of the fact that it is the matrix of a flow ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this means that @xmath133 must be negative .",
    "the second fact is that since @xmath122 corresponds to the matrix of the equation of variations traveling half way along the periodic orbit given by @xmath134 ( because we chose our @xmath118 s so it would be that way ) , we must have that @xmath135 .",
    "but this means that @xmath136 and @xmath137 and the matrix @xmath122 itself @xmath124 .",
    "now we simply repeat the computation done in equation ( [ eq : negid ] ) and the proof of lemma [ lem : main ] is complete .    we are now ready to complete the proof of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "recall that @xmath56 as constructed is the solution to the ode ( [ stat2 ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath138 and @xmath139 denote the count for @xmath56 of @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "lemma [ lem : main ] shows that @xmath140 and it is clear that @xmath141 , and so the quantity @xmath142 is the same for all @xmath56 , and in particular is equal to @xmath49 for @xmath58 .",
    "this completes the first part of the proof of theorem [ th : main ] .    in order to determine the instability of the limit soliton we must proceed topologically using the methods developed in the proof of the main theorem of @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed that in @xmath63 , @xmath143 a solution to @xmath144    following @xcite we can associate to each solution @xmath56 a curve @xmath145 , and to @xmath66 a curve @xmath146 in @xmath147 the space of lagrangian planes in @xmath148 .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "let @xmath149 denote the evolution operator of the ode corresponding to the equation of variations of the ode ( [ stat2 ] ) along the solution @xmath56 .",
    "likewise , let @xmath150 denote the evolution operator of the ode corresponding to the equation of variation of the ode ( [ top2 ] ) along the solution @xmath151 . thus",
    "if @xmath152 is a pair of initial conditions at @xmath153 , then for any @xmath154 we have that the evolution of @xmath152 under the equation of variations along @xmath66 , @xmath56 respectively will be given by @xmath155 , respectively @xmath156 .",
    "we remark that the initial conditions @xmath157 will be the same for each @xmath56 as well as for @xmath66 .    again appealing to @xcite ,",
    "we can explicitly write the curves @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the space of lagrangian planes @xmath158 .",
    "this is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 now we observe that the curves @xmath145 and @xmath146 actually lie on a torus contained in @xmath147 .",
    "it was established in @xcite that because @xmath56 and @xmath66 are solutions corresponding to homoclinic orbits in the phase plane of equations ( [ stat2]),and ( [ top2 ] ) , the curves @xmath145 , and @xmath146 have well defined end points .",
    "let @xmath163 , @xmath164 be the endpoints in @xmath147 of @xmath145 .",
    "that is , let @xmath165 and set @xmath166 further because @xmath143 and lemma [ lem : main ] , we have that @xmath167 , and @xmath168 for all @xmath54 . in the previously introduced coordinates on the torus in @xmath147 this means that the limits of @xmath169 , @xmath170 are equal to the limits of @xmath171 and @xmath172 as @xmath173 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to calculate explicitly that @xmath174 as @xmath175 .    still following the outline laid out in @xcite , we denote by @xmath176 the lift of the point ( or curve ) in the torus embedded in @xmath147 to its corresponding point in the universal cover of the torus , @xmath86 .",
    "we will parametrize the universal covering of the torus in the obvious way . without loss of generality ,",
    "all of the @xmath163 s and @xmath177 can be lifted to the same point @xmath178 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for each @xmath54 , @xmath164 lifts to the point @xmath179 . thus lemma [ lem : main ]",
    "implies that each @xmath164 lifts to the same point @xmath180 ,    next we observe that as @xmath143 pointwise , @xmath181 in the torus inside @xmath147 pointwise , and the compactness of the torus and of @xmath147 , means that the end point @xmath182 must lift to the same point in the cover as @xmath183 .",
    "thus we have that @xmath184 .",
    "finally , it was shown in @xcite , that if @xmath185 , then the corresponding soliton underlying the curve @xmath186 is unstable .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ th : main ]    the proof of theorem 2 may also be couched in the language of fixed end point homotopy classes .",
    "there are several ways to define such classes , see for example @xcite or @xcite , and the references therein . in this context theorem [ th : main ]",
    "establishes that the fixed end - point homotopy class of the curve @xmath186 is the same as those for @xmath145 .",
    "an immediate consequence of this observation is that in @xmath147 , it is possible to deform the curves @xmath186 , and @xmath187 all to the curve @xmath188 , in a continuous way .",
    "[ remark ] one can also consider so - called _ surface _ gap solitons , and obtain exactly the same results as for theorem [ th : main ] .",

    "it is natural to extend the study to the case when the solutions are localized , but do not tend to the uniform zero solution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ( in)stability of such solitons is proposed to be studied in the future using analytical methods similar to that presented herein .",
