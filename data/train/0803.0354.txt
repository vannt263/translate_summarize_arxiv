    ", high energy , high statistics neutrino scattering experiment running at the tevatron at fermi national accelerator laboratory can look beyond the standard model at terascale energies by making precision electroweak measurements , direct searches for novel phenomena , and precision qcd studies . in this article",
    "we limit the discussion to precision electroweak measurements ; qcd studies and their impact on the precision measurements are explored in ref .",
    "the ideas developed in this article were proposed within the context of an expression of interest for a new neutrino experiment , nusong ( neutrino scattering on glass ) @xcite .     left : `` elastic scattering '' ( es ) .",
    "right : `` inverse muon decay '' ( imd ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a unique and important measurement of the nusong physics program is the ratio of neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) neutrino - electron scattering , which probes new physics .",
    "the leading order feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynmanesimd ] . the nc process , @xmath5 , called `` elastic scattering '' or es , provides the sensitivity to the terascale physics .",
    "this process can explore new physics signatures in the neutrino sector which are not open to other , presently planned experiments .",
    "the cc process , called `` inverse muon decay '' or imd , @xmath6 , is well understood in the standard model due to precision measurement of muon decay @xcite . since the data samples are collected with the same beam , target and detector at the same time , the ratio of es to imd events cancels many systematic errors while maintaining a strong sensitivity to the physics of interest .",
    "our measurement goal of the es to imd ratio is a 0.7% error , adding systematic and statistical errors in quadrature .",
    "the high sensitivity which we propose arises from the combined high energy and high intensity of the nusong design , leading to event samples more than an order of magnitude higher than past experiments .",
    "normalizing the es to the imd events represents an important step forward from past es measurements , which have normalized neutrino - mode es measurements to the antineutrino mode , @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the improvement is in both the experimental and the theoretical aspects of the measurement .",
    "first , the flux contributing to imd and @xmath8 es is identical , whereas neutrino and antineutrino fluxes are never identical and so require corrections .",
    "second , the ratio of @xmath8 es to @xmath9 es cancels sensitivity to beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics effects from the nc to cc coupling ratio , @xmath10 , which are among the primary physics goals of the nusong measurement .",
    "in contrast , there is no such cancellation in the es to imd ratio .    the design of this experiment , described in sec .",
    "[ concept ] , is driven both by requiring sufficient statistics to make precision neutrino - electron scattering measurements and by the need for a neutrino flux which does not extend below the imd threshold .",
    "the threshold for imd events is @xmath11 where we have dropped the small @xmath12 term for simplicity .",
    "the functional form above threshold , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imdthresh ] , is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the center of mass energy .",
    "thus a high energy neutrino beam is required to obtain a high statistics sample of these events .",
    "the flux design should provide a lower limit on the beam energy of about 30 gev , still well above the imd threshold .",
    "threshold factor for the imd cross section , as a function of neutrino energy.,title=\"fig : \" ]    sec .",
    "[ ewreview ] describes the standard model physics of neutrino electroweak scattering , for both electron and quark targets . in this section",
    ", the value of the normalization of the es to imd events is further explored .",
    "the very high statistics will also permit an electroweak measurement using the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data sample from nusong , via the `` paschos wolfenstein method '' ( pw ) @xcite .",
    "the best electroweak measurement using dis events to date comes from the nutev experiment , which has observed an anomaly .",
    "the status of this result is reviewed below .",
    "making conservative assumptions concerning systematic improvements over nutev , our measurement goal using this technique is a 0.4% error on @xmath15 , adding statistical and systematic errors in quadrature .    in sec .",
    "[ terascale ] , we discuss nusong s potential to discover or constrain new physics through indirect probes , by making precision measurements of sm processes to look for deviations from sm predictions .",
    "we first frame the issue by considering in turn several model - independent parameterizations of possible new physics and asking what constraints will be imposed on new physics in the event nusong agrees with the sm .",
    "( 1 ) oblique correction parameters describe the effects of heavy new states in vector boson loops .",
    "( 2 ) new states may induce higher - dimensional effective operators involving neutrinos .",
    "finally , ( 3 ) new states may modify the couplings of the gauge bosons to neutrinos and leptons , including possibly violating lepton universality . in each case",
    "we consider the ability of nusong to detect or constrain these types of deviations from the sm .    in sec .",
    "[ models ] , we examine specific models for new physics .",
    "we begin by presenting the sensitivity to a set of new physics models . in particular",
    ", we consider    * typical @xmath3 models , * non - degenerate leptoquark models , * r - parity violating susy models , * extended higgs models .",
    "the models were selected because they are often used as benchmarks in the literature . while this list is not exhaustive , it serves to illustrate the possibilities . for each case , we consider how nusong compares to other measurements and note the unique contributions .",
    "we end this section by approaching the question from the opposite view , asking : how could the results from nusong clarify the underlying physics model , should evidence of new physics emerge from lhc in the near future ?    two further studies which can be performed by nusong are qcd measurements and direct searches .",
    "the very large ( @xmath16 million event ) dis sample will allow the opportunity for precision studies of qcd .",
    "there are many interesting measurements which can be made in their own right and which are important to nusong s terascale physics program .",
    "the very high flux will also permits direct searches for new physics .",
    "those which complement the physics discussed in this paper include :    * non - unitarity in the light neutrino mixing matrix ; * wrong - sign inverse muon decay ( wsimd ) , @xmath17 ; * decays of neutrissimos , _",
    "i.e. , _ moderately - heavy neutral - heavy - leptons , with masses above 45 gev .    for more information on these studies ,",
    "see refs .  @xcite .",
    "in order to discuss the physics case for a new high energy , high statistics experiment , one must specify certain design parameters for the beam and detector .",
    "the beam and detector should marry the best aspects of nutev @xcite , the highest energy neutrino experiment , and charm ii @xcite , the experiment with the largest es sample to date .",
    "the plan presented here is not optimized , but provides a basis for discussion .",
    "the final design of the nusong detector will be based on these concepts , and is still under development .    in this section , we present , but do not justify , the design choices . later in this article , we discuss the reasoning for the choices , particularly in secs .",
    "[ imdvsbarnu ] and [ justify ] .",
    "we will assume a beam design based on the one used by the nutev experiment @xcite , which is the most recent high energy neutrino experiment .",
    "this experiment used 800 gev protons on target .",
    "the beam flux , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] , is ideal for the physics case for several reasons .",
    "there is essentially no flux below 30 gev , hence all neutrinos are well above the imd threshold .",
    "it is sign - selected : in neutrino mode , 98.2% of neutrino interactions were due to @xmath18 and @xmath19 secondaries , while in antineutrino mode 97.3% came from @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the `` wrong sign '' content was very low , with a 0.03% antineutrino contamination in neutrino mode and 0.4% neutrino contamination in antineutrino mode .",
    "the electron - flavor content was 1.8% in neutrino mode and 2.3% in antineutrino mode .",
    "the major source of these neutrinos is @xmath22 decay , representing 1.7% of the total flux in neutrino mode , and 1.6% in antineutrino mode .",
    "redesign of the beamline for nusong is expected to lead to modest changes in these ratios .",
    "for example , if the decay pipe length is 1.5 km rather than 440 m , as in nutev , the @xmath23 ratio increases by 20% and the fractional @xmath24 content is reduced .    with respect to tevatron running conditions",
    ", we will assume that twenty times more protons on target ( pot ) per year can be produced for nusong compared to nutev .",
    "this is achieved through three times higher intensity per pulse ( or `` ping '' ) .",
    "nearly an order of magnitude more pulses per spill are provided .",
    "our studies assume 4 @xmath25 10@xmath26 pot / year , with 5 years of running .",
    "preliminary studies supporting these goals are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the event rates quoted below are consistent with 1.5@xmath27 protons on target in neutrino running and @xmath28 protons on target in antineutrino running .",
    "the choice to emphasize neutrino running is driven by obtaining high statistics es , which has a higher cross section for neutrino scatters , and to use the imd for normalization  this process only occurs in neutrino scattering .",
    "the standard model forbids an imd signal in antineutrino mode .",
    "however , some antineutrino running is required for the physics described in the following sections , especially the pw electroweak measurement .",
    "the beam from such a design is highly forward directed .",
    "nutev was designed so that 90% of the neutrinos from pion decay were contained within the detector face , where the detector was located at 1 km . for nusong , which will use a 5 m detector , @xmath490% of the neutrinos from pion decay",
    "are contained at @xmath43 km .",
    "the optimal detector is a fine - grained calorimeter for electromagnetic shower reconstruction followed by a toroid muon spectrometer .",
    "this allows excellent reconstruction of the energy of the outgoing lepton from charged current events .",
    "we employ a charm ii style design @xcite , which uses a glass target calorimeter followed by a toroid .",
    "we assume one inch glass panels with active detectors interspersed for energy and position measurement .",
    "glass provides an optimal choice of density , low enough to allow electromagnetic showers to be well sampled , but high enough that the detector length does not compromise acceptance for large angle muons by the toroid .",
    "approximately 10% of the glass will be doped with scintillator to allow for background studies , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ justify ] .",
    "the design introduces four identical sub - detectors of this glass - calorimeter and toroid design , each a total of 29 m in length ( including the toroid ) . between each sub - detector",
    "is a 15 m decay region for direct searches for new physics .",
    "the total fiducial volume is 3 ktons .",
    "the nusong run plan , for reasons discussed in sec .",
    "[ imdsub ] and [ imdvsbarnu ] , concentrates on running in neutrino mode .",
    "this design will yield the rates shown in table  [ tab : rates ] .",
    "these rates , before cuts , are assumed throughout the rest of the discussion .",
    "we can compare this sample to past experiments .",
    "the present highest statistics sample for @xmath29 and @xmath30 es is from charm  ii , with 2677@xmath3182 events in neutrino mode and 2752@xmath3188 events in antineutrino mode @xcite .",
    "thus the proposed experiment will have a factor of 30 ( 2.5 ) more @xmath8(@xmath32)-electron events .",
    "as an example , after cuts , the first method of analysis described in sec .",
    "[ justify ] retains 63% of the @xmath8 sample . for deep inelastic scattering , 600 m and 190 m events",
    "are expected in neutrino and antineutrino modes , respectively .",
    "after minimal cuts to isolate dis events @xcite , nutev had 1.62 m dis ( nc+cc ) events in neutrino mode and 0.35 m in antineutrino mode ; thus nusong has orders of magnitude more events .",

    "horizontal lines indicate the projected @xmath34 limits of nusong.,title=\"fig : \" ]      by the time nusong runs , the lhc will have accumulated a wealth of data and will have begun to change the particle physics landscape .",
    "the message from lhc data may be difficult to decipher , however . as discussed below",
    ", nusong will be able to help elucidate the new physics revealed at the lhc .",
    "the discovery of a higgs along with the anticipated measurement of the top mass to 1 gev precision would effectively fix the center of the @xmath35 plot and will enhance the power of the precision electroweak data as a tool for discovering new physics .",
    "if additional resonances are discovered at the lhc , it is still likely that little will be learned about their couplings .",
    "the nusong experiment provides complementary information to lhc .",
    "rather than generalize , to illustrate the power of nusong , two specific examples are given here .",
    "we emphasize that these are just two of a wide range of examples , but they serve well to demonstrate the point . here",
    "we have chosen examples from typical new physics models other than @xmath3 models which were discussed above , in order to demonstrate the physics range which can be probed by nusong .",
    "first , extend the standard model to include a non - degenerate @xmath36 triplet leptoquark ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 in the notation of @xcite , with masses in the 0.5 - 1.5 tev range . at the lhc",
    "these leptoquarks will be produced primarily in pairs through gluon fusion , and each leptoquark will decay to a lepton and a jet @xcite .",
    "the peak in the lepton - jet invariant mass distribution will be easily detected over background .",
    "this will provide the leptoquark masses but yield little information about their couplings to fermions .",
    "the leptoquarks will also shift the neutrino - nucleon effective coupling @xmath39 in a way that depends sensitively on both the leptoquark couplings and masses .",
    "such a leptoquark - induced shift could provide an explanation for the nutev anomaly @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", nusong would find that isospin and the strange sea can be constrained to the point that they do not provide an explanation for the nutev anomaly , thus the nutev anomaly is the result of new physics .",
    "the nusong pw measurement of @xmath40 will agree with nutev ; @xmath33 and the @xmath41 and @xmath42 elastic scattering measurements will agree with lep .",
    "[ fig : nusongew1 ] illustrates this example .",
    "nusong s measurement of @xmath39 would provide a sensitive measurement of the leptoquark couplings when combined with the lhc mass measurements as inputs .",
    "a second example is the existence of a fourth generation family .",
    "a fourth family with non - degenerate masses ( _ i.e. _ isospin violating ) is allowed within the lep / sld constraints @xcite . as a model ,",
    "we choose a fourth family with mass splitting on the order of @xmath43 gev and a 300 gev higgs .",
    "this is consistent with lep at 1@xmath44 and perfectly consistent with @xmath45 , describing the point ( 0.2,0.19 ) on the @xmath35 plot . in this scenario",
    ", lhc will measure the higgs mass from the highly enhanced @xmath46 decay .",
    "an array of exotic decays which will be difficult to fully reconstruct , such as production of 6 w s and 2 b s , will be observed at low rates . in this scenario",
    ", isospin violation explains the nutev anomaly , thus the nutev pw and the nusong pw measurements agree with the @xmath8ees measurements .",
    "these three precision neutrino results , all with `` lep - size '' errors , can be combined and will intersect the one - sigma edge of the lep measurements .",
    "[ fig : nusongew2 ] illustrates this example . from this , the source , a fourth generation with isospin violation , can be demonstrated .",
    "lastly , while it seems unlikely , it is possible that lhc will observe a standard model higgs and no signatures of new physics .",
    "if this is the case , it is still possible for nusong to add valuable clues to new physics .",
    "this is because the experiment is uniquely sensitive to the neutrino sector .",
    "if a situation such as is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : nusongew3 ] arose , the only explanation would be new physics unique to neutrino interactions .",
    "nusong is an experiment which can search for new physics from kev through tev energy scales , as well as make interesting qcd measurements .",
    "this article has focussed mainly on the terascale physics which can be accessed through this new high energy , high statistics neutrino scattering experiment .",
    "the case has been made that this new neutrino experiment would be a valuable addition to the presently planned suite of experiments with terascale reach .",
    "the nusong experiment design draws on the heritage of the charm ii and ccfr / nutev experiments . a high energy",
    ", flavor - pure neutrino flux is produced using 800 gev protons from the tevatron .",
    "the detector consists of four modules , each composed of a finely - segmented glass - target ( sio@xmath47 ) calorimeter followed by a muon spectrometer . in its five - year data acquisition period , this experiment will record almost one hundred thousand neutrino - electron elastic scatters and hundreds of millions of deep inelastic scattering events , exceeding the current world data sample by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this experiment can address concerns related to model systematics of electroweak measurements in neutrino - quark scattering by direct constraints using _ in - situ _ structure function measurements .",
    "nusong will be unique among present and planned experiments for its ability to probe neutrino couplings to beyond standard model physics .",
    "this experiment offers four distinct and complementary probes of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "two are of high precision with the proposed run - plan , and the precision of the other two would be improved by a follow - up five - year antineutrino run .",
    "neutrino - lepton non - standard interactions can be probed with an order of magnitude improvement in the measured effective couplings .",
    "neutrino - quark non - standard interactions can be probed by an improvement in the measured neutrino - quark effective couplings of a factor of two or better .",
    "the experiment is sensitive to new physics up to energy scales @xmath50 tev at 95% cl .",
    "the measurements are sensitive to universality of the couplings and an improvement in the @xmath51-family of 30% and @xmath52-family of 75% will allow for probes of neutrissimos . as a unique contribution , nusong measures @xmath53 , which is not accessible by other near - future experiments .",
    "this article described nusong s physics contribution under several specific models . these included models of @xmath3s , extended higgs models , leptoquark models and @xmath54-parity violating susy models .",
    "we also considered how , once data are taken at lhc and nusong , the underlying physics can be extracted . the opportunity for direct searches related to these indirect electroweak searches",
