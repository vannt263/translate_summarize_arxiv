    "a new paradigm of information processing based on the laws of quantum physics has triggered intensive research into studying physical systems that can be used as the building blocks of a future quantum processor .",
    "remarkable progress towards realizing quantum information processing elements has been achieved by using both natural and artificial atoms as qubits , and in arranging them into more complex circuits @xcite .",
    "artificial atoms are engineered quantum systems that have a number of advantages in comparison to their natural counterparts .",
    "first , they are fabricated using existing well - developed nanofabrication methods of conventional electronics and therefore can be placed at will whilst having controllable custom - designed features .",
    "second , their size is macroscopic ( @xmath1 m ) , which simplifies the task of coupling multiple qubits together into integrated quantum circuits .",
    "the large size of artificial atoms results in their large dipole moment which enables strong coupling of individual qubits to electromagnetic field .",
    "third , their energy levels are tunable by external fields , which simplifies control of the quantum states and inter - qubit couplings . as a downside ,",
    "the undesired coupling to the environment is strong , leading to shorter coherence times of artificial as compared to natural atoms .",
    "this requires careful design of the experimental apparatus to protect fragile quantum states .",
    "superconducting quantum devices containing josephson junctions can behave like atoms and are primary candidates to being the building blocks of the quantum processor @xcite .",
    "while there has been enormous progress in the field in the past fifteen years or so @xcite , the superconducting qubit circuits require further optimsation in order to meet the stringent requirements on coherence for large scale quantum information processing @xcite . nonetheless , the presently available circuits are already good enough for doing quantum optics and atomic physics experiments on a chip @xcite .",
    "a key approach to this is coupling a superconducting qubit to a microwave resonator , thus forming a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) architecture @xcite , which is a solid - state analogue of the cavity qed approach @xcite used to study the interaction of natural atoms with photons . in circuit qed , the field confinement produced by the very small mode volume in combination with the macroscopic size of the qubit results in strong qubit - photon coupling , where quantum excitations can transfer between the artificial atom and the resonator and back many times before decay processes become appreciable .",
    "circuit qed architecture is uniquely suitable for manipulating microwave radiation at the single photon level @xcite and for generation of single microwave photons on demand @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the single microwave photon generation is based on an artificial superconducting atom directly coupled to an open - end transmission line , a 1d analogue of the 3d half - space @xcite . here",
    "we report on a design comprising eight resonators , each housing a superconducting transmon qubit @xcite that exhibits good coherence properties .",
    "the design allows for efficient frequency multiplexed testing and assessment of the superconducting qubits and is suitable for single microwave photon generation .",
    "this involves time - domain control of the quantum state in the superconducting circuit , which is a well developed technique commonly used in qubit experiments .",
    "the key feature of our design is that it allows for multiplexed generation of single photons with an efficiency of @xmath2 using quantum state manipulation and dynamic tuning of the circuit parameters .",
    "this provides the means of coupling solid - state qubits with each other for long - distance communications as well as linking stationary and flying qubits .",
    "the resonators are designed as coplanar waveguides in superconducting metal film , having a centreline width w = 20@xmath3 m and centreline to groundplane spacing of s = 10@xmath3 m , achieving a characteristic impedance @xmath4 on our sapphire substrate .",
    "we calculate from the geometry of our transmission lines a capacitance per unit length of @xmath5 , an inductance per unit length @xmath6 , and a phase velocity of @xmath7 so that a @xmath0 resonator at 7@xmath8ghz has a length of 4220@xmath3 m .",
    "the eight @xmath0 resonators are designed with unloaded operating frequencies of 7.0 , 7.1 , 7.2 @xmath9 7.7@xmath10ghz by varying their lengths ( see figure [ chip_layout ] ) .",
    "the resonators are inductively coupled to a common feedline running diagonally across the chip ( see figure [ inductive_coupling ] ) .",
    "the coupling strength between the feedline and the resonators is adjusted by a short , @xmath11 m , section of the resonator parallel to the feedline with centre to centre distance of @xmath12 m .",
    "the inductive coupling between the feedline and resonator directly determines the coupling quality factor @xmath13 of the @xmath0 resonator at the resonator s operating frequency @xmath14 . following barends",
    "@xcite we have that :    @xmath15    we designed for @xmath16 , corresponding to an @xmath17 parameter between the feedline and resonator of @xmath18db , and a resonance linewidth of @xmath19 .",
    "our design is similar to other frequency multiplexed qubit devices @xcite",
    "all the qubits utilised in the experiment are transmons that are anharmonic lc oscillators whose nonlinear inductance is provided by josephson junctions .",
    "the transmon is essentially a charge qubit @xcite whose josephson junction is shunted by a large capacitor that dominates the total capacitance of the device and thus reduces the sensitivity to charge noise @xcite .",
    "the qubit is described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the charging and josephson energies , respectively ; @xmath23 is the number of cooper pairs transferred between the superconducting electrodes ; @xmath24 is the effective offset charge and @xmath25 is the superconducting phase difference between the two electrodes comprising the qubit .",
    "the transmon energy level structure is determined entirely by @xmath22 and @xmath21 , and it is operated in the regime @xmath26 .",
    "we designed the qubit to have a maximum @xmath27 transition frequency of @xmath28 , higher than the bare frequencies of the resonator array , by assuming that @xmath29 . for fixed @xmath30 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath31 influences the qubit dephasing rate through the sensitivity of @xmath30 to the gate offset charge @xmath24 , with large values of @xmath32 promoting long relaxation times . at the same time",
    ", the value of @xmath32 determines the maximum qubit operation speed through the level anharmonicity @xmath33 , with faster operation times favouring smaller values of @xmath34 @xcite . since in our case",
    "the qubit forms part of a single photon source where both parameters are important , we selected a suitable compromise as @xmath35 which allows for operation times of the order of tens of ns while maintaining long relaxation times ( @xmath36s ) .    the josephson energy @xmath22 and charging energy @xmath21 are determined by the device tunnel junction resistance @xmath37 and device self - capacitance @xmath38 , respectively , properties that are under engineering control during fabrication according to the simple relations :    @xmath39    @xmath40    where the quantum resistance @xmath41 and @xmath42 is related to the superconducting gap @xmath43 in aluminium used to fabricate the tunnel junctions according to @xmath44 .",
    "substituting @xmath35 and @xmath45 yields @xmath46 and @xmath47 , corresponding to a josephson energy @xmath48 and charging energy @xmath49 .",
    "it is also useful to express the charging energy @xmath21 as a frequency @xmath50 following @xmath51 , and we find @xmath52 .",
    "the final important property of the qubit for our purposes is the state dependent dispersive shift @xmath53 of the resonator , where @xmath54 is the coupling strength between the resonator and qubit and @xmath55 is the frequency difference between the bare qubit and resonator states @xcite .",
    "when the qubit and resonator are well detuned from one another , the state of the qubit @xmath56 or @xmath57 ` pulls ' the resonator frequency by @xmath58 from the bare resonator frequency , providing a means to read out the qubit state @xcite .",
    "next we consider determining the coupling capacitance @xmath59 so as to realise a desired dispersive shift @xmath60 .",
    "we find :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the qubit - resonator detuning , @xmath50 is the charging energy expressed as a frequency ( 540mhz ) , and @xmath63 describes the vacuum rms voltage fluctuations of the resonator .",
    "we have that :    @xmath64    so that in our @xmath0 resonators , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . substituting the values above",
    "determines the desired coupling capacitance as @xmath67 .",
    "the total self capacitance @xmath68 is the sum of the tunnel junction capacitance and the geometric capacitance .",
    "we estimate the junction capacitance using a typical value of the specific capacitance for al ultrasmall tunnel junctions of 45ff/@xmath3m@xmath69 @xcite , which for our junction area of @xmath70nm@xmath69 gives @xmath71ff . clearly , the junction capacitance contributes only about 1% to @xmath68 and we can safely neglect it .",
    "the qubit self - capacitance @xmath38 is then determined through the shunt geometry , whilst the qubit gate capacitance is determined by the separation between the end of the transmission line and the qubit shunt .",
    "the device geometry was designed using the comsol electromagnetics modelling package to obtain the desired @xmath38 and @xmath59 . to obtain the desired @xmath37 and",
    "thus @xmath22 , the junction oxidation time and pressure were adjusted to obtain a tunnel resistance of 8.2k@xmath72 measured through the parallel combination of the two nominally @xmath70nm@xmath69 tunnel junctions in the device squid loop .",
    "the junction resistance was confirmed by measuring test junctions of the same dimensions as the transmon device , fabricated on the same chip , as shown in figure [ squid_loop_image ] .",
    "the samples were fabricated on a single crystal c - axis oriented sapphire wafer .",
    "the fabrication process involved two major steps : patterning of the niobium groundplane , followed by deposition of the transmon structure and tunnel junctions .",
    "_ patterning of the groundplane : _ the feedline , @xmath0 resonators and qubit shunt capacitors were formed by etching a 100 nm niobium metal film deposited by dc magnetron sputtering onto the sapphire wafer .",
    "the metal coated wafer was spin - coated with ar6200(el11 ) resist at 6000rpm for 60 seconds , and the resist was baked on a hotplate at 150@xmath73c for 9 minutes before the resonator and feedline structures were exposed in an e - beam writer to a dose of 350@xmath3c / cm@xmath69 using a 58na beam current and proximity correction routine .",
    "the exposed wafer was developed in ar600 - 546 developer for 3 minutes before immersing in isopropyl alcohol to halt the development process .",
    "the resulting wafer was dried using n@xmath75 gas and the resist was reflow baked for 5 minutes at 150@xmath73c .",
    "an sf@xmath76+o@xmath75 reactive ion etching process was then used to transfer the pattern from the resist into the niobium film .",
    "the reactive ion etching chamber was pre - conditioned for 10 minutes before the samples were loaded and etched for 3 minutes 15 seconds , resulting in pattern transfer into the niobium film .",
    "the e - beam resist was removed by immersing in ar600 - 71 solvent for 5 minutes , followed by sonicating in acetone for 1 minute and rinsing in isopropyl alcohol for 1 minute , before drying in n@xmath75 gas .",
    "the patterned wafer was then coated with a protective layer of az5214e photoresist before dicing into 8@xmath778 mm chips using a hubless resin blade .",
    "following dicing , the protective resist was removed in acetone followed by isopropyl alcohol and n@xmath75 drying .",
    "_ deposition of transmon tunnel junctions : _ the chips were prepared for qubit junction deposition by spin - coating with two layers of mma(8.5)maa el11 resist , at 4000rpm for 60 seconds , then baking each layer for 2 minutes at 160@xmath73c , to create a 1@xmath3 m film of mma(8.5)maa resist , followed by a single layer of 950 pmma a4 spun at 4000rpm for 60 seconds and baked for 10 minutes at 160@xmath73c . to avoid excessive charging during e - beam exposure ,",
    "the resist structure was coated with an `` e - spacer 300z '' conductive layer by spinning at 4000rpm for 60 seconds .",
    "the qubit patterns were exposed using a beam current of 1.1na on fine structures and 10na on coarse structures .",
    "the exposed resist was developed by rinsing in flowing deionised water for 30 seconds to remove the e - spacer layer , followed by immersion in 1:4 vol : vol methyl isobutyl ketone : isopropyl alcohol developer for 20 seconds , and then immersion in a 1:2 vol : vol mixture of methyl glycol : methanol for 20 seconds , followed by immersion in isopropyl alcohol for 10 seconds to halt development , before blowing dry with n@xmath75 gas .",
    "the resulting resist structure was used to deposit the qubit junctions in an electron beam evaporation chamber equipped with a tilting sample stage , argon ion milling capability and o@xmath75 inlet needle valve .",
    "the sample surface was first cleaned by ion milling for 5 minutes using 1kv argon ions .",
    "a 20 nm aluminium film was evaporated whilst the stage was tilted at @xmath78 .",
    "the aluminium was then oxidised in 4 mbar o@xmath75 for 4 minutes before a second 20 nm aluminium layer was deposited with the stage tilted to + 17@xmath73 .",
    "the resulting chips were subjected to a lift - off process in warm acetone at 52@xmath73 for 30 minutes , followed by a cleaning rinse in fresh acetone , isopropanol and drying with n@xmath75 gas .",
    "the normal state resistance of the parallel combination of two nominally 100@xmath77100nm@xmath69 tunnel junctions was measured and found to be 8.2k@xmath72 .",
    "a schematic of the measurement setup showing the microwave attenuation at each stage of the dilution refrigerator.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the chip containing superconducting elements was bonded to a printed circuit board and mounted at the mixing chamber plate in a cryogen - free dilution refrigerator with a base temperature around 10mk .",
    "the sample houses eight resonators and eight qubits to provide redundancy against fabrication yield issues related to individual resonators or qubits and to provide a choice of frequency of the emitted microwave photon .",
    "the feedline was bonded to the input and output coaxial lines as shown in figure [ measurement_setup ] .",
    "the microwave signal from the room temperature source was attenuated at different temperatures inside the cryostat to suppress the black - body radiation that would otherwise reach the sample . on the output side , the chip was protected from the amplifier input noise and black - body radiation by two isolators mounted at the base temperature .",
    "the outgoing signal was amplified by 39db at 3k before it was amplified further by 40db at room temperature .",
    "the qubit level spacing was controlled through the adjustment of @xmath22 by an external magnetic field threading the qubit squid loop , which was generated both by a small superconducting coil placed under the chip holder , and by on - chip flux bias lines capable of producing a magnetic field local to each qubit .",
    "initial characterisation of the sample was performed by measuring the feedline transmission @xmath79 around 6.8 - 7.8ghz , which identified the @xmath0 resonators .",
    "we chose to focus the study on the resonator at 7.5ghz .",
    "the transmission past this resonator at an incident power in the single photon regime is shown in figure  [ transmission_dip ] and corresponds to an external quality factor @xmath80 , or a resonator decay rate @xmath81 .",
    "the resonance lineshape is well - fit using the method of @xcite by assuming the resonator is overcoupled to the feedline , with an internal quality factor @xmath82 .",
    "the presence of the qubit was confirmed by the dispersive shift of the resonator frequency due to the interaction of the resonator and the nonlinear element , which was measured by single tone spectroscopy , sweeping the frequency and power of a probe tone in a continuous wave experiment , and measuring transmission through the feedline with a vector network analyser . as shown in figure [ chi_plot ] , at input powers below @xmath83dbm",
    "the qubit is in the groundstate @xmath84 and the resonator experiences a frequency shift @xmath85 from the bare resonator frequency . at input powers above @xmath86dbm , the resonator becomes populated with many photons and the resonance frequency returns to that of the bare resonator @xcite . with the qubit - resonator detuning @xmath87mhz , we observed a dispersive shift @xmath88mhz .",
    "once the presence of the qubit was confirmed , the hybridisation between the resonator and qubit states was investigated by flux tuning the josephson energy @xmath22 and hence the resonator - qubit detuning @xmath55 .",
    "the effective josephson energy of our device follows :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the magnetic flux through the squid loop , @xmath91 is the flux quantum , and @xmath92 is the josephson energy at @xmath93 . to achieve flux tuning of the device ,",
    "we use both a small solenoid external to the sample and an on - chip flux bias line to manipulate the josephson energy .",
    "we use a two - tone spectroscopy technique to investigate the coupled qubit - resonator system @xcite , measuring transmission past the resonator whilst sending a probe tone to excite the qubit . through use of this method",
    "we are able to trace out the qubit and resonator frequencies as a function of the applied magnetic flux @xmath90 , presented in figure [ anticrossing_figure ] , showing the anti - crossing of the qubit and resonator states at around @xmath94 .",
    "the data are well fit by assuming a resonator qubit coupling of @xmath95 .",
    "( a ) measured transition frequencies of resonator and qubit states determined by monitoring the resonator dispersive shift , as a function of applied flux bias @xmath90 .",
    "( b ) close - up of the resonator - qubit hybridisation point , showing the anti - crossing of the resonator and qubit states . ( model of the hybridised resonator - qubit states shown overlaid.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "the transition frequency of the qubit @xmath96 is dominated by the @xmath97 term , and is almost insensitive to the @xmath98 correction . to determine the charging energy of our device spectroscopically",
    ", we make use of the dispersive shift @xmath60 which is related to @xmath21 and @xmath55 . we have that :    @xmath99    using our observed values of @xmath95 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 we deduce @xmath102 , which corresponds closely to the @xmath103 design value targeted in our comsol model .",
    "we can then solve for the josephson energy @xmath22 as :    @xmath104    yielding @xmath105 or equivalently @xmath106 .        to characterise the qubit we measured coherent rabi oscillations around the qubit maximal gap where the energy bands are first order insensitive to the magnetic field ( the `` sweet spot '' ) , by sweeping a variable length pulse from 8.502 to 8.520ghz , with durations from 0 to 1000ns .",
    "we inferred the qubit state by measuring the dispersive shift of the resonator through @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the rabi oscillations are presented in figure [ chevron ] and fourier transformed in figure [ chevron_fft ] .",
    "the oscillations exhibit a typical pattern @xcite , with the lowest oscillation frequency , @xmath108mhz , at the drive frequency of 8.512ghz when the drive frequency matches the qubit gap . at zero detuning the probability for the qubit to be in the excited state",
    "is close to unity .",
    "when the drive frequency is detuned by @xmath55 to lower or higher frequency from the qubit sweet spot , the rabi oscillation frequency increases as @xmath109 . also , as expected , when the drive frequency is detuned from the sweet spot the probability of the excited state decreases as @xmath110 and also the qubit decoheres faster . from this data",
    ", we found that for our microwave amplitude at zero detuning , it takes about 80ns to transfer the qubit from the ground to excited state .",
    "the pulse that performs this excitation is called the @xmath111-pulse .      to characterise the coherence properties of the transmon qubit , we measured the qubit energy relaxation time @xmath112 by exciting the qubit from the ground to first excited state using a @xmath111 pulse , and varying the delay time @xmath114 between the control and readout pulses as indicated in the inset of figure [ qubit_characterisation_t1 ] .",
    "the observed decay of the excited qubit state is described by an exponential relaxation , giving @xmath115s , which compares favourably with the transmon relaxation times measured in earlier experiments @xcite .    the qubit dephasing time was first measured using the ramsey fringe visibility technique of two @xmath116 pulses separated by a variable delay @xmath114 , to include the influence of low frequency noise that may adversely affect the photon source during operation .",
    "we found @xmath117 presented in figure [ qubit_characterisation_t2_ramsey]i .",
    "fourier transforming the ramsey fringe data ( figure [ qubit_characterisation_t2_ramsey]ii ) reveals two oscillating components of equal magnitude , separated in frequency by 554khz .",
    "we interpret these two components as arising from quasiparticle tunnelling events that take place on a characteristic timescale slow compared to each shot of the experiment , but fast compared to the @xmath118 realisations that are averaged to provide the detected signal @xcite .",
    "the echo technique was then used to eliminate this low - frequency noise , using a @xmath119 pulse sequence and recording the resonator dispersive shift to infer the qubit state .",
    "we found a value of @xmath120 presented in figure [ qubit_characterisation_t2_echo ] .",
    "schematics of the pulse sequences used are shown in the insets of figure [ qubit_characterisation ] .",
    "the @xmath112 and @xmath121 lifetimes of the qubit were then measured as a function of the qubit level spacing @xmath30 , which was swept by varying the magnetic field and hence @xmath22 . at the @xmath93 ` sweet - spot '",
    "where the josephson energy is first - order insensitive to magnetic field , @xmath112 and @xmath113 take their maximum values .",
    "once the qubit - resonator detuning @xmath55 begins to fall towards zero , the @xmath112 value is drastically reduced due to the purcell effect , corresponding to relaxation of the qubit by microwave photon emission from the resonator .",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath121 as a function of @xmath30 are plot in figure [ purcell ] .",
    "we now turn to the use of this device as a single microwave photon source .",
    "there are two different regimes in which a qubit coupled to a cavity can be used to generate single microwave photons : the qubit level spacing @xmath30 can be static @xcite or dynamically tuned to exchange photons with the resonator @xcite . while our device was designed for dynamic tuning , we will start by discussing the use of the simpler static case . here the qubit - resonator detuning is fixed , the qubit is excited by a pulse from the flux tuning line , and",
    "the qubit emits a photon into the resonator which in turn releases the photon to the transmission - line .",
    "the efficiency of such a source is :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the polarisation of the qubit after applying the @xmath111-pulse .",
    "we estimate @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the duration of our @xmath111-pulse . for the parameters of our device we obtain @xmath126 as the probability that the photon will leave the resonator with the qubit at the sweet - spot . tuning the qubit towards the strong purcell limit we can approach @xmath127 based on the data in figure 8 . to reach a much higher source efficiency with static qubit tuning ,",
    "the resonator must be coupled strongly to the transmission line .",
    "the current coupling @xmath128 is instead close to the optimal value for a dynamic protocol to generate single photons with much higher efficiency .",
    "the dynamic protocol calls for the qubit to first be excited by a @xmath111-pulse whilst detuned from the @xmath0 resonator , followed by use of the flux tuning line to bring the qubit into resonance with the @xmath0 structure for a duration @xmath129 , effectively swapping the excitation from the qubit to the resonator . in our experiment",
    "the flux tuning line used to modulate @xmath22 has a bandwidth of 1ghz , meaning that we can bring the qubit and resonator into resonance with one another in @xmath1301ns . the time taken to tune",
    "the qubit is therefore negligible compared to the @xmath111-pulse duration ( 80ns ) and vacuum rabi swap ( 58ns ) .",
    "once the excitation is transferred to the @xmath0 resonator , the photon can either be absorbed by loss mechanisms in the resonator , or emitted into the feedline .",
    "the efficiency of the source under these operating conditions is therefore :    @xmath131    this expression being valid in the fast driving and strong coupling limit where @xmath132 and @xmath133 . for our device , we find that @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath135 measured as a function of qubit transition frequency , showing an enhanced relaxation rate as the qubit transition frequency approaches that of the resonator.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the efficiency of the photon source when dynamic tuning is employed is limited principally by the loss mechanisms of the @xmath0 resonator into which the photon is emitted .",
    "our photon source efficiency could be improved by increasing @xmath136 .",
    "the best internal quality factor reported for 2d superconducting resonators at low excitation power is @xmath137 @xcite",
    ".    the source efficiency can also be improved through lowering @xmath13 , however @xmath13 can not be lowered arbitrarily , as the purcell effect will begin to shorten @xmath112 even when the resonator and qubit are detuned during the excitation phase of the dynamic protocol .",
    "there is then an optimal value of @xmath13 for a given qubit @xmath112 and resonator frequency @xmath138 .",
    "we have that :    @xmath139    the best @xmath112 times reported in the literature for superconducting qubits are a factor of 15 higher than the device realised in this paper @xcite . if we could build a device whose @xmath140 we would be able to decrease @xmath13 to 3500 .",
    "if we were also able to make use of higher quality resonators , then we could hope to achieve a source efficiency @xmath141 .",
    "we have fabricated and characterised a superconducting qubit multiplexing circuit that appears to be promising for single microwave photon generation .",
    "we note that the resonators frequencies and quality factors are close to the designed ones .",
    "the qubit parameters , such as the maximal energy gap , which exceeds the resonator frequency by about 1@xmath8ghz , are also close to the desired ones .",
    "finally , the qubit - resonator and resonator - feedline couplings appeared to be consistent with expectations .",
    "the measured qubit coherence times and resonator intrinsic quality factors are consistent with those reported by other groups , but can be further improved to produce a single microwave photon source with an efficiency approaching 100% .",
