    "secondly , an analogous curvature perturbation on hypersurfaces of uniform weyl - fluid density on the brane also remains constant on large scales @xcite .",
    "we have given gauge - invariant definitions of these quantities in terms of bulk metric perturbations .",
    "while the matter perturbations are necessarily defined only on specific bulk slicings ( i.e. , the brane or some arbitrary extension into the bulk ) we can define weyl - fluid perturbations that are gauge - invariant throughout the bulk allowing the weyl tensor evolution to be described in terms of a local density , momentum and pressures .",
    "our partial understanding of brane - world metric perturbations thus far allows us to predict the initial amplitude of perturbations in idealised ( de sitter ) models of inflation @xcite . for perturbations that remain constant on super - horizon scales we can estimate their initial amplitude before horizon re - entry @xcite .",
    "this amounts to calculating brane - world corrections to conventional 4d results .",
    "but we have yet to calculate the amplitude of any intrinsically 5d effects , such as the interplay between bulk and brane metric perturbations at horizon entry in the radiation dominated era .",
    "this is where novel effects might appear , even at low energies , which could be testable in astronomical surveys of cosmological backgrounds .",
    "the outstanding challenge is to make detailed predictions , probably requiring numerical solutions , of the evolution of the coupled matter and metric perturbations on cosmological time- and length - scales .",
