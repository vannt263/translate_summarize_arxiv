    "recently , the investigation of fermi acceleration ( fa ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) time - dependent billiards has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "fermi acceleration is the unbounded energy gain of particles exposed to driving forces and was first proposed in 1949 by enrico fermi @xcite to explain the high energies of cosmic radiation ( for a review of fa see ref .",
    "he suggested that charged particles repeatedly interact with time - dependent magnetic fields ( originating either from shock waves of supernovae or from magnetized interstellar clouds ) in such a way that on average they gain energy .",
    "nowadays , fa is investigated in a variety of systems belonging to different areas of physics , such as astrophysics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , atom optics @xcite and has even been used for the interpretation of experimental results in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) prototype system allowing the investigation of fa is the so - called fermi - ulam model ( fum ) @xcite , which consists of non - interacting particles moving between one fixed and one oscillating wall .",
    "the fum and its variants have been the subject of extensive theoretical ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and experimental @xcite studies . in the fum",
    ", the existence of fa depends exclusively on the driving - law of the oscillating wall : as long as the driving law is sufficiently smooth , there is no unlimited energy growth due to the existence of invariant spanning curves @xcite . in particular",
    ", this means that harmonic driving laws do not lead to fa in the fum .    in 2d time - dependent billiards ,",
    "already a smooth driving law may lead to fa .",
    "for example , the existence of fa was shown for a harmonically oscillating stadium - like billiard @xcite , in the driven eccentric annular billiard @xcite , in an oval billiard @xcite and in the time - dependent elliptical billiard @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the breathing concentric annular @xcite and the circular billiard @xcite do not exhibit fa .",
    "the ensemble - averaged energy @xmath0 in all the 2d time - dependent billiards that do show fa , grows as a function of time according to a power law , i.e. @xmath1 , with some exponent @xmath2 . for such power laws",
    ", it is known that fa is not structurally stable in the sense that any finite amount of dissipation will destroy it @xcite , independent on whether dissipation is introduced via inelastic collisions or via drag forces ( e.g. stokes friction ) .",
    "thus , a natural question to ask is whether there are certain time - dependent billiards that show a somewhat ` faster ' acceleration of the energy , in particular whether there is e.g. exponential acceleration possible .",
    "the first hint that such a fast acceleration process is possible is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors prove the existence of single orbits with exponential energy growth under certain conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the energy of a whole ensemble of particles grows exponentially in a rectangular billiard with an oscillating bar inside .",
    "this result is generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors show by means of an analysis of the anosov - kasuga invariant that in special classes of billiard systems the ensemble averaged energy accelerates exponentially .    while in refs .",
    "@xcite a mathematical analysis of exponential fa is provided , the aim of the present work is to investigate the physical mechanism leading to exponential fa in the setup proposed in ref .",
    "this setup consists of an oscillating bar inside a rectangular billiard , where the bar is aligned parallel to the long side of the rectangle .",
    "this can be interpreted as particles moving alternately in a fum and in a static rectangular billiard .",
    "since neither the static rectangular billiard nor the fum alone even show fa , we want to clarify from a physical point of view how the combination of the both leads to exponential fa , i.e. what are the microscopic processes that cause the astonishingly fast acceleration . to this end",
    ", we will show that in the high velocity regime , the temporal movement of the particles on invariant curves of the fum can be modeled by a suitable random walk with step sizes being proportional to the velocity itself .",
    "this random walk model shows exponential acceleration .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding parameters of the random walk can be extracted from the underlying fum , even enabling an alternative ( compared with the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) prediction of the exponential acceleration rate without any free parameters .",
    "the work is structured as follows : in section [ ch : setup ] we introduce the setup and show the results of our numerical simulations . how the microscopic dynamics of single trajectories can be interpreted as piecewise motion along invariant spanning curves of an appropriate fermi - ulam model is shown in section [ ch : fum ] . with this picture in mind , we construct a random walk model in section [ ch : rwm ] that generalizes the considered model incorporating the basic characteristics of the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "finally , a short summary and outlook is given in section [ ch : conclusion ] .",
    "and length @xmath3 with an oscillating bar of length @xmath4 placed in the center , parallel to the @xmath5-axis ( here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the two areas above and below the bar are the interactions areas ( with the moving bar ) a and b , respectively .",

    "it consists of a rectangular billiard of length @xmath3 and height @xmath9 with an oscillating bar inside . the rectangular billiard without the bar is integrable , since upon collisions with the billiard boundary , just the sign of the corresponding component of the velocity @xmath10 is reversed , i.e. in particular @xmath11 and @xmath12 are preserved .",
    "now , a bar of length @xmath4 is placed in the middle of the billiard , parallel to the longer side ( @xmath5-direction ) of the billiard . here , we assume an harmonic oscillation law : @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the driving amplitude and frequency , respectively . since the oscillating bar transfers momentum in @xmath16-direction only ,",

    "we iterate these particles by numerically solving the corresponding discrete mapping , i.e. by calculating the successive collisions with the billiard boundary , which consists of the rectangle and the bar .",
    "the main computational effort is to determine the time of the next collision with the oscillating bar , where the smallest root of an implicit equation ( with possibly many roots ) has to be found , see e.g. refs .",
    "the main quantity of interest is the time - evolution of the ensemble averaged modulus of the velocity in @xmath16-direction ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ) , which is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is velocity of the @xmath25-th particle at time @xmath26 .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for 3000 oscillations of the bar on a semilogarithmic scale .",
    "the ensemble averaged velocity clearly grows exponentially @xmath27 as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a growth rate of @xmath28 .",
    "let us now develop a physical picture of this acceleration process , answering the question how we can link the microscopic dynamics of single trajectories to the appearance of exponential fermi acceleration .    .",
    "the velocity grows exponentially , @xmath29 , with a growth rate of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",

    "we define the time @xmath37 the particle spends in the fum by each passing of the interaction area ( a or b , see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) as the time difference between the first and the last collision with the oscillating bar while the particle is in the interaction area .",
    "the motivation for this definition is that only collisions with the oscillating bar change @xmath19 , i.e. we want to keep track of the time in which a certain change in the velocity takes place .",
    "the times @xmath35 and @xmath37 are not identical , since once a particle enters the interaction area , a certain amount of time will elapse , before it collides with the bar .",
    "however , for high velocities @xmath10 , which means that @xmath19 is large since @xmath38 , @xmath37 converges towards @xmath35 . by ` high ' we mean that @xmath10 is large compared to the maximal velocity of the bar , i.e. for @xmath39 ( which implies @xmath40 ) we obtain @xmath41 .",

    "the swa deviates significantly from the exact result .",
    "[ fig : fum],width=325 ]    since the dynamics of particles can be described for some time spans @xmath37 as a 1d fum , it is convenient to summarize some of the properties of the fum ( for a more detailed description see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the phase space of the fum is shown in fig .",

    "the motion becomes more and more regular , until for @xmath45 there are exclusively invariant spanning curves corresponding to a synchronized motion between the oscillating wall and the particles .",
    "due to these invariant curves , there is no diffusion in momentum space and the fum with a harmonic oscillation of the wall does not show fermi acceleration .    the invariant spanning curves @xmath46 are not just straight lines , but show a characteristic shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fum ] ) .",
    "there are infinitely many of them , which can be labeled by the velocity @xmath47 and are parametrized as @xmath48 .",

    "this means that the velocity is also much larger than the velocity @xmath44 of the fisc .",
    "a particle enters the interaction area , let s say above the bar ( interaction area a ) , at time @xmath71 with a certain velocity @xmath72 and spends the time @xmath73 in it .",

    "the particle can enter either the interaction area a or b , i.e. above or below the bar depending on the exact dynamics .",
    "however , for high velocities , in a good approximation this is a random process , as argued in ref  @xcite , i.e. the particle will be injected with probability one half above and with probability one half below the bar .",

    "if it is injected in part b we have to add a phase shift of @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 , since the two fum s ( above and below the bar ) can be transformed into each other simply by shifting the phase by @xmath79 .",

    "the reason for this is as follows : the sum of two sequences of the dynamics each consisting of e.g. three steps , one with a @xmath142 close to the maximally possible value @xmath143 in each step and one with steps close to the minimal value of @xmath142 ( i.e. @xmath144 ) contributes more significantly to the ensemble average @xmath145 , than the sum of two corresponding sequences both with step width @xmath146 .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    "we calculated a mean of the latter type and therefore obtained a lower bound of the correct growth rate .",
    "the deviation of the result obtained from the simulation and the one from the model can thus be understood as a consequence of the negligence of correlations .",

[",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) shows characteristic ( decaying ) oscillations , as already theoretically predicted in ref .",
    "the minima where @xmath155 is exactly zero can be easily understood . at these values of @xmath15 , the driving period @xmath139 and the time between two collisions with the same vertical wall @xmath156 are commensurable , what leads to a @xmath64-periodic entering and leaving of the fum for @xmath157 ( when the first and the last collision with the oscillating bar are converged to its edges ) .",
    "note that the occurrence of the minima in the growth rate @xmath155 are based on the fact , that all particles of the ensemble possess the same , constant velocity in @xmath5-direction .",
    "apparently , these characteristic oscillations are fully reproduced by our model .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the analogous comparison between model and simulation for a fixed driving frequency @xmath121 and different but small values of the amplitude ( the regime where the invariant spanning curves of the fum can be well approximated within the swa ) . from this",
    ", we firstly observe that the growth rate strongly increases with the amplitude of the oscillating bar , and secondly , that this dependency can be well explained by the random walk model .",
    "according to the good agreement between the simulation and the model , we may conclude from eq .   and eq .   that the amplitude - dependence of the growth rate is approximately given by @xmath158 .",
    "[ fumiscs ] reveals , we may not expect that this is also true for large values of the amplitude , since then the expressions for the invariant spanning curves obtained within the static wall approximation strongly differ from the numerical results .",
    "obviously , the result of the simulation is between the estimations for the lower and the upper bound for all values of the system parameters .",
    "+ these results indicate that all details of the specific system under consideration which are not accounted for the random walk model including the existence of a chaotic sea do not contribute crucially to the growth rate .",
    "even more , all details of the specific system are only needed to calculate the effective @xmath99 .",
    "the requirements for the occurrence of exponential fermi acceleration are comparatively weak : a temporally periodic entering and leaving of invariant spanning curves with @xmath159 at different phases is sufficient .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the physical mechanism leading to exponential fermi acceleration ( fa ) in the rectangular billiard with an oscillating bar inside . in particular",
    ", we showed that the dynamics of individual trajectories can be understood as alternating phases of motion in an appropriate one - dimensional fermi - ulam model ( fum ) and free propagation . during the temporal fum phases , the particles move ( in the high velocity regime which is of interest here ) on invariant spanning curves of the fum , which can be - at least for small driving amplitudes - obtained analytically within the static wall approximation . using the intrinsic property of the invariant spanning curves of the fum that the difference between the maximal and the minimal velocity grows linearly with the minimal velocity of the invariant curve and the fact that acceleration and deceleration have equal probability , the process can be modeled as a random walk with step width proportional to the velocity itself , i.e. @xmath160 .",
    "this model explains the occurrence of the exponential acceleration .",
    "calculating an effective step width @xmath147 we obtain a good ab initio estimation of the growth rate and reproduce the whole qualitative dependency of the system parameters .",
    "we emphasize , that our random walk model reflects that a temporally periodic entering and leaving of equally shaped invariant spanning curves which have the property that the difference between the maximal and the minimal velocity grows linearly with the minimal velocity of the latter are the key ingredients for the occurrence of exponential fermi acceleration ( all details of the specific system are contained in the factor @xmath99 ) .",
    "this opens the perspective of searching for other systems exhibiting the phenomenon of exponential fermi acceleration .",

    "<S> we analyze the underlying physical mechanism and show that the phenomenon can be understood as a sequence of highly correlated motions , consisting of alternating phases of free propagation and motion along the invariant spanning curves of the well - known one - dimensional fermi - ulam model . </S>",
    "<S> the key mechanism for the occurrence of exponential fermi acceleration can be captured in a random walk model in velocity space with step width proportional to the velocity itself . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces the occurrence of exponential fermi acceleration and provides a good ab initio prediction of the value of the growth rate including its full parameter - dependency . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis clearly points out the requirements for exponential fermi acceleration , thereby opening the perspective of finding other systems exhibiting this unusual behaviour . </S>"
