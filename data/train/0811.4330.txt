    "though the problem of bipolar charge injection in insulator media is many years old  @xcite , it anew became of great interest during last years in view of application of insulating materials as basic elements of electronic devices such as ferroelectric random access memories ( ferams )  @xcite , organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) or organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds )  @xcite .",
    "in the latter devices organic semiconductors are used which show many properties of dielectric materials , especially relatively large band gaps and thus , a low intrinsic charge carrier density .",
    "the charge carriers have to be injected into the organic layer from the electrodes and thereby must overcome the injection barriers at the organic / electrode interfaces .",
    "it is experimentally established that the injection conditions influence significantly the oled performance  @xcite .",
    "different models for the injection process are proposed in the literature . for low injection barriers ,",
    "one expects the contact to be ohmic , meaning that the contact is able to supply more charges per unit time than the bulk of the insulator can transport . in this case , a space - charge region is formed and the electric field at the interface is supposed to vanish  @xcite . because excess charge - carriers dominate the charge transport in insulators , a space - charge - limited current ( sclc ) density of the form @xmath0 is observed ( in the absence of charge - carrier traps ) , where @xmath1 is the sample thickness and @xmath2 is the applied voltage .",
    "current - voltage ( _ iv _ ) characteristics of space - charge limited devices are determined by the bulk properties of the insulator with no influence of the contact properties @xcite .    for high injection barriers , one anticipates the injection rate across the conductor / insulator interface to dominate the _ iv _",
    "characteristic of the system .",
    "the models to describe injection are the fowler - nordheim ( fn ) tunneling model or the richardson - schottky ( rs ) model for thermionic injection  @xcite .",
    "the fn model assumes tunneling through a triangular barrier into an unbound continuum of states .",
    "the rs model on the other hand describes charge injection as a thermally activated hopping over the potential barrier , where barrier lowering due to the superposition of the external electrostatic potential and the image - charge potential is considered .",
    "an attempt to incorporate space - charge effects into the hopping injection model was undertaken in refs .  .",
    "however , all these models consider injection as a single electron process .    an alternative description of the injection process is given by the drift - diffusion theory involving electron - electron interaction in a mean - field approximation  @xcite . in this homogeneous continuum model widely used for the description of conventional crystalline semiconductors , the drift - diffusion equation in combination with the poisson equation involves space - charge effects , but meets the problem of self - consistency in the boundary conditions .",
    "namely , the electrostatic potential generated by the injected charge carriers modifies the injection barrier , but on the other hand the amount of charge - carriers injected per unit time depends on the barrier height .",
    "thus , the values of the electrical field and charge - carrier density at the interface can not be imposed but have to be found self - consistently implying the modification of the injection barrier , too .",
    "an effort to perform a self - consistent analysis of the contact phenomena was made in ref .  .",
    "however , the current and the field in this approach were not defined in a self - consistent way .",
    "this can be performed if the drift - diffusion theory involves both , the insulator and the conductor side of the system , in analogy to a strongly asymmetric _ pn_-junction . in the work of neumann _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , a self - consistent numerical treatment of the unipolar injection and transport processes in a conductor / insulator / conductor device was presented in which continuity of the electrochemical potential and the electric displacement was assumed everywhere in the system , in particular at the contacts .",
    "the conductor and the insulator were characterized by their specific density of state ( dos ) distributions .",
    "the exact analytical solution in a self - consistent manner for the charge injection across the sole conductor / insulator interface has been also obtained  @xcite .    this model does not yet allow for a self - consistent description of organic light emitting diodes , where bipolar transport takes place  @xcite .",
    "to do so , one has to account for the recombination of charge carriers ( holes and electrons ) which are usually present in the organic constituent of the heterostructure under consideration . in such systems",
    "the recombination is often believed to be of langevin type  @xcite , _ i.e. _ is considered as a bimolecular process .",
    "many oled models involve the recombination of electrons and holes ( see , for example , refs .  ) .",
    "probably , the most complete description was presented by malliaras and scott  @xcite , who included a surface recombination at the contacts as well as a bimolecular recombination kinetics and diffusion in the bulk .",
    "however , the assumed boundary conditions for ohmic contacts excluded diffusion at the contacts , where it is most important . a comprehensive one - dimensional numerical model accounting for space - charge effect was developed by tuti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite which comprised the hopping transport in single and bilayer devices and tunnel injection from electrodes .",
    "however , besides the injection barriers given by the bare difference of the chemical potential in the metal and the frontier molecular orbital in the organic material this model involves a range of artifacts such as tunneling factors , effective attempt frequencies , etc .",
    "hence , in spite of a good agreement with experiments , this numerical tool is very complicated .    in the present paper ,",
    "we apply the diode model given in ref .   to elaborate a self - consistent oled model .",
    "the properties of a semiconductor / organic / conductor structure are modeled where holes and electrons are simultaneously injected from an indium tin oxide ( ito ) anode and a ca cathode into the organic layer , respectively .",
    "the focus will be on the influence of the injection barriers and the recombination on the spatial distribution of the injected charge carriers and on the resulting _ iv _ characteristics as well as recombination efficiencies .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , trap states and a field dependent mobility of the organic semiconductor constituent will be excluded at this stage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical model of the charge injection in semiconductor / insulator / conductor structure .",

    "iiib , the _ iv _ characteristics of the system ( sec .",
    "iiib ) are calculated varying the heights of injection barriers and the rate of the langevin recombination .",
    "we also discuss the calculated voltage dependences of the recombination efficiency of the considered structure ( sec .",

    ", the effective barriers decrease with the voltage tending to become equal at vanishing barrier for the recombination - free case .",
    "however , recombination weakens this decrease so that nonzero effective barriers are obtained at much higher voltages . by that the difference between @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    "remains considerable and even increases significantly for high magnitudes of the recombination rate .",
    "paradoxically , the prevailing injection barriers provide a _ significant _ extension of the voltage range where the sclc - like behavior of the _ iv _ characteristic occurs .      integrating the product",

    "( [ difkappa1 ] ) ] over the thickness of the organic layer , we obtain a quantity having the dimension of a current density and usually called the recombination current density , @xmath144 ( ref .  ) .",
    "it stands for the total number of recombination events in the volume of organic constituent per unit square of the interface , per unit time .",
    "this quantity determines the recombination efficiency of the device , @xmath145 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the calculated dependences of the recombination current density on the applied voltage are given in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the barrier heights @xmath136 0.3 and 0.4  ev .",
    "the total recombination current increases with increased recombination parameter @xmath116 and thus a higher luminance of the oled is expected .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] that already for the smallest calculated values of the recombination parameter @xmath116 a substantial recombination current is observed while in the range from @xmath117 to 1 the increase in @xmath144 rather weak .",
    "in general , the recombination currents follow the _ iv _ characteristics with an increased total recombination rate for an increased current density . however , the dependence of the recombination efficiency @xmath146 on the applied voltage unveil important details . in fig .",
    "[ figeff ] the recombination efficiency is depicted using the same parameters as for the system in fig .",
    "the recombination efficiency shows features which have not been discussed in previous works  @xcite where different boundary conditions at the injecting interfaces have been assumed . in general , a maximum in @xmath147 is found close to @xmath124 no matter which injection barriers have been considered .",
    "this may be explained by the detailed analysis of the carrier densities and partial currents as follows : a fast increase of the electric current @xmath16 occurs at voltages @xmath148 ( ref .  )",
    "corresponding to the shockley diode equation for unipolar injection  @xcite . assuming a virtually independent unipolar injection for electrons and holes from the two electrodes one can expect the faster increase of the recombination current @xmath149 quadratic in carrier densities which results in the peak close to @xmath124 . at higher bias",
    "@xmath147 depends strongly on the injection barrier heights and the charge carrier mobilities . for rather balanced but high injection barriers (",
    "@xmath114  ev ) there is a large range of voltage where the efficiency is strongly attenuated independently of the recombination parameter . assuming that the built up of space - charge is small due to the substantial injection barriers , the electric field is constant in the device and the injection barrier lowering scales linearly with the applied voltage as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figeb],a in between 3 and 30  v. however , for low bias the injection barrier lowering is negligible so that the density of electrons and holes stays roughly constant for a wide voltage range .",
    "therefore the recombination current does not change if the bias increases . at the same time , since the total current is proportional to the electric field a drop of the efficiency upon the bias increase is expected . for an initiation of barrier lowering",
    ", the charge carrier densities of electrons and holes grow exponentially with the barrier lowering and thus an increase in the recombination current sets in .",
    "the efficiency saturates and increases again . for a further increase in bias the reduction of the injection barrier heights",
    "is weakened since space charges emerge .",
    "the respective injection barriers tend to diverge leading to a higher injection barrier for holes than for electrons balancing the charge carrier densities in the insulator .",
    "since balanced charge - carrier densities result in an optimized recombination rate the self - balancing effect leads to an increase in efficiency .    introducing asymmetric injection barriers",
    "the efficiency - voltage characteristic changes dramatically . for a higher value of the hole injection barrier , @xmath120  ev , and thus a low electron injection barrier the attenuation of the efficiency due to high injection barriers is missing .",
    "the most pronounced change in the efficiency curve is the appearance of the peak denoted by  d in fig .",
    "[ figeff],b for @xmath150 .",
    "increasing the voltage coming from @xmath124 leads to a buildup of space - charge for the charge carriers with the lower barrier , in this case electrons .",
    "strong injection of electrons contributes to the electric current @xmath16 but does not add much to the recombination current because the minority carriers remain in the barrier - limited regime .",
    "this provides the fall of the efficiency down to the point  c. however , since the electron mobility is low , the negative space charge does not result in a strong current . on the other hand ,",
    "the langevin recombination parameter @xmath84 is large since it is dominated by the larger hole mobility .",
    "therefore , the efficiency is not fully attenuated . in the area c to  d where the electrons are already in the space - charge regime with approximately constant and low barrier , the barrier for holes decreases ( see fig .  [ figeb],b ) providing exponential increase of the minority carriers .",
    "this does not contribute much to the electric current @xmath16 but strongly promotes the recombination current @xmath149 .",
    "further increase of the voltage depresses the injection barrier at the hole - injecting side leading to an substantial amount of holes accumulated at the anode .",
    "now the above mentioned self - balancing effect sets in and the efficiency tends to increase again .",
    "apparently , the charge carrier mobilities are important for the efficiency peak  d. assuming comparable charge carrier mobilities for electrons and holes , a strong reduction of the efficiency can be observed below 30  v.    it should be also noted that the change of the mobility ratio ( for example , by decrease of the hole mobility ) not only varies quantitatively the values of the current and the efficiency but also acts strongly on the position and the shape of the recombination zone .",
    "this is seen from fig .",
    "[ figeff3 ] , where the spatial distributions of this zone , calculated in several points of the @xmath151 dependences of fig .",
    "[ figeff],b for the cases @xmath152 and @xmath153 , are presented . with increased applied voltage",
    ", the recombination zone extends through the whole organic layer as long as equal mobilities @xmath152 are assumed , whereas in the case of the large mobility difference there is a pronounced peak of the recombination zone moving to the electron - injecting electrode since the injected holes are faster than the electrons .",
    "thus , additionally to the case of fully balanced injection and transport properties , which is often difficult to achieve in single - layer devices  @xcite , it may be possible to maximize the recombination efficiency in an oled with imbalanced injection and transport properties compensating the small amount of the minority carriers by their relatively high mobility with respect to the mobility of the dominating carriers .      to evaluate the presented model it",
    "is compared to experimental data obtained from a diode consisting of a single poly(phenylene vinylene ) ( ppv ) layer of thickness @xmath154  nm sandwiched between ito and ca electrodes .",
    "the characteristic energies of the lumo and homo levels of the employed ppv are 2.8  ev and 5  ev , respectively and the hole mobility @xmath80 equals @xmath155  @xmath113/(v  s ) ( refs .  ) . the ratio of the electron and hole mobilities is assumed to be @xmath156 .",
    "it is known , that the work function of ito is sensitive to the cleaning procedure and thus , it may be varied from 4.7  ev to 5  ev ( up to the energy of the homo level ) .",
    "therefore , we are allowed to consider the injection barrier @xmath130 as one of the fitting parameters .",
    "the other barrier , @xmath157 , is supposed to be unchanged and equals 0.07  ev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the measured _ iv _ characteristic of the ito / ppv / ca structure is shown as well as the _ iv _ dependences calculated for @xmath158  ev ( the best fitting value ) and for different values of fitting parameters @xmath159 .",
    "on the one hand , the calculation satisfactory reproduces the magnitude and the general form of _ iv _ characteristic using reasonable parameters . on the other hand , however , the _ exact _ shape of the _ iv _ curve can not be fully approximated by a unique set of parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that the proposed model misses still some important features of insulators , in particular of organic semiconductors .",
    "first of all , realistic dos shapes for the lumo and homo levels as well as trap levels in the insulator layer have to be accounted for .",
    "this leads effectively to a field and charge carrier density dependence of the mobilities which may increase the calculated currents at larger voltages .",
    "it should be also noted , that due to this the ratio of the hole and electron mobilities varies with the change of the applied voltage  @xcite .    comparing the luminance efficiency in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] with the calculated recombination efficiency a good reproduction of the voltage dependence can be obtained above 3  v. here , the calculated recombination efficiency was normalized to the measured luminance efficiency ignoring e.g. the voltage dependence of the extraction efficiency .",
    "there is , however , a strong discrepance of the measured and fitted efficiency curves at lower voltages . again",
    ", this difference may be due to the absence of trap levels in our simple model . at low voltages ,",
    "strong trapping could arise close to the electrode shifting the recombination zone to the injecting contact giving rise to a strong reduction of the luminance efficiency due to quenching effects  @xcite .    concentrating on the effect of injection on the device performance one has to consider also a possible formation of the dipole layers at the electrode / organic interface which may have crucial consequences for the prevailing charge - carrier injection barriers .",
    "dipole layers may be a result of self - organization or a consequence of the deposition of some functional layer at the interface  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of a dipole - layer formation can not be incorporated self - consistently in the developed phenomenological approach , however , an effective change in the injection barrier heights can be assumed .",
    "notice , that in this case the magnitudes of injection barriers @xmath130 and @xmath157 are decoupled and become independent .",
    "if compared to other models of bipolar transport and recombination in oleds the model presented here describes satisfactorily a crossover from the high - voltage , space - charge limited regime to the low - voltage , barrier - dominated regime .",
    "even the regime around the built - in potential which is problematic in theories using other boundary conditions  @xcite is well described . comparing with very comprehensive discrete one - dimensional simulations by tuti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite our approach presents a simpler continuous description using a strongly reduced number of fitting parameters .",
    "in the calculation of the charge - carrier transport through insulators , the fundamental question about boundary conditions generally arises when charge - carrier injecting interfaces are involved . in this paper ,",
    "a simple one - dimensional model describing the bipolar charge - carrier transport across a semiconductor / insulator / conductor structure was presented , where the problem of injection was for the first time solved self - consistently .",
    "essentially , continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical potential was assumed , thus matching them at the injecting interfaces of the electrodes with the insulator .",
    "additional boundary conditions were defined far into the electrode materials , where the influence of the involved materials on each other is negligible so that they can be regarded as independent .",
    "considering the poisson equation , the electric - field distributions and the current - voltage characteristics were derived using as an example the organic semiconductor sandwiched between ito and ca electrodes .",
    "the influence of different injection conditions and recombination rates on the current transport properties of such a structure was analyzed .",
    "it was found that the injection barriers determine the dominating carrier type and strongly influence the distributions of the charge and of the induced field in the organic layer .",
    "the recombination influences on these quantities most strongly when the heights of injection barriers for holes and electrons are comparable .",
    "it was shown that the injection barriers and recombination together with the mobility ratio define the position and shape of the recombination zone in the organic layer as well as drastically affect the current - voltage characteristics of the considered diode structure .",
    "we have also found that in the case of significantly different injection barriers a high recombination efficiency of a diode may be still achieved in the case of a relatively high mobility of the minority carriers .",
    "notice , that the controlling of the carrier mobility in organic devices is experimentally possible  @xcite .",
    "finally , we can conclude that the presented self - consistent model of charge injection reveals unambiguously that injection barriers and recombination rate are the governing factors controlling the transport properties of semiconductor / insulator / conductor structures . on the other hand",
    ", this model can not yet provide a complete description of the particular case of oleds because some specific features of these systems are still missing .",
    "most important of them are the realistic dos shapes including energetically distributed trap states  @xcite or concentration- and field - dependent carrier mobilities  @xcite characteristic of organic semiconductors .",
    "the latter feature is followed by the exponential - type dependence of the injection current on the device thickness  @xcite which can hardly be expected within our consideration .",
    "further extension of the model concerning the inclusion of the above - mentioned features is necessary for better application to experimental data and is now in preparation .",
