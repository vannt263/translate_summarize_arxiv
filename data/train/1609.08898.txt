    "learning the covariance structure of a stochastic process from data is a fundamental prerequisite for problems such as prediction , classification and control . for example , to do prediction for an ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) ( uhlenbeck and ornstein @xcite ) process @xmath0 , @xmath1 $ ] with mean 0 and covariance function @xmath2 where @xmath3 are unknown ,",
    "ying @xcite proposed the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimators for @xmath4 and @xmath5 based on discrete observations @xmath6 with @xmath7 , and established the root-@xmath8 consistency of the corresponding ml estimator for @xmath9 .",
    "note that since the probability measures induced by two ou processes are absolutely continuous with respect to each other if and only if their @xmath9 values are equal ( ibragimov and rozanov @xcite ) , the parameters in ( [ expcovfun1dim ] ) are asymptotically identifiable up to @xmath9 .",
    "however , when the ou process is subject to measurement error , the so - called `` nugget '' effect ( see , for example , cressie @xcite ) may deteriorate the performance of the ml estimators .",
    "in particular , chen , simpson and ying @xcite showed that the ml estimator for @xmath9 becomes fourth - root-@xmath8 consistent , depicting the effect of measurement error in estimating the exponential covariance parameters in ( [ expcovfun1dim ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", they also proved that the ml estimator of the measurement - error variance has the usual root-@xmath8 consistency .",
    "in fact , a similar phenomenon can also be found in a driftless brownian motion ( bm ) process with measurement error .",
    "let this error - contaminated process be denoted by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "having observed @xmath11 , stein @xcite showed that a modified ml ( mml ) estimator of the ratio of the variance of the increments of the bm process to that of measurement error is only fourth - root-@xmath8 consistent , whereas the corresponding mml estimator of the measurement - error variance still remains root-@xmath8 consistent .",
    "similar asymptotic results for the ml estimators of the two variances have also been established by at - sahalia , mykland and zhang @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we shall superimpose a time trend ( regression ) term on an ou process with measurement error in order to accommodate a broader range of applications . specifically , we propose the following model for a real - valued stochastic process",

    "we refer the reader to sacks , schiller and welch @xcite and ying @xcite .",

    ", we shall allow @xmath32 to be misspecified , which further increases the flexibility of model ( [ setupfullmodel ] ) .",
    "however , a misspecified time trend will usually create extra challenges in estimating covariance parameters .",
    "this motivates us to ask how the ml estimators of the covariance parameters in model ( [ setupfullmodel ] ) perform when the corresponding time trend model is subject to misspecification .    to facilitate exposition",
    ", we assume in the sequel that @xmath33 $ ] for some @xmath34 , and the data are observed regularly at @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , we also allow that the number of regressors ( model complexity ) @xmath37 grows to infinity in order to reduce the model bias .",
    "when @xmath38 , the domain @xmath39 $ ] has been considered by the aforementioned authors , and the setup is called fixed domain asymptotics . on the other hand , when @xmath40 , the domain @xmath41 grows to infinity as @xmath42 with a faster growing rate for a larger @xmath43 value , and the setup is referred to as the increasing domain asymptotics , even though the minimum inter - data distance @xmath44 goes to zero .",
    "this is different from the increasing domain setup considered by zhang and zimmerman @xcite , in which the minimum distance between sampling points is bounded away from zero . by incorporating both fixed and increasing domains ,",
    "our _ mixed _ domain asymptotic framework enables us to explore the interplay between the model misspecification / complexity and the growing rate of @xmath41 on the asymptotic behaviors of the ml estimators , thereby leading to an intriguing answer to the above question .",
    "re - parameterizing ( [ expcovfun1dim ] ) by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the covariance parameter vector in model ( [ setupfullmodel ] ) can be written as @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 , the parameter space , be a compact set in @xmath49 and suppose @xmath50 .",
    "based on model ( [ setupfullmodel ] ) and observations @xmath51 , we estimate @xmath52 using the ml estimator @xmath53 , which satisfies @xmath54 where @xmath55 \\label{loglikefuntrue } \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}'\\bigl(\\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{m}(\\bolds \\theta)\\bigr)'\\bolds\\sigma^{-1 } ( { \\bolds\\theta } ) \\bigl ( \\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{m}(\\bolds\\theta)\\bigr)\\mathbf{z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is known as the profile log - likelihood function , in which @xmath56 , @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 being full rank almost surely ( a.s . ) . it is not difficult to show that the ml estimator of @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 however , since model ( [ setupfullmodel ] ) can be misspecified , investigating the asymptotic properties of @xmath64 is beyond the scope of this paper",

    "is mainly made by @xmath73 the first term above , vanishing when ( [ correct ] ) holds true , is due to model misspecification , and the second term , having an order of magnitude @xmath74 uniformly over @xmath48 ( see lemma  [ lemmaprojectionsup ] ) , is related to model complexity .",
    "we therefore introduce @xmath75 as a uniform bound for ( [ bound ] ) over @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath76 .",
    "the growing rates of @xmath41 needed for @xmath77 , to achieve consistency are given in the next theorem in terms of the order of magnitude of @xmath78 .",

    "then , for @xmath34 , @xmath83    theorem  [ thmconsistency ] shows that as long as ( [ assumptionofmisselected ] ) holds true , @xmath84 is a consistent estimator of @xmath85 , regardless of the value of @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , in order for @xmath86 and @xmath87 to achieve consistency , one would require @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "in fact , these two constraints can not be weakened because we provide counterexamples in section  [ sec3 ] illustrating that @xmath87 is no longer consistent when @xmath90 , and both @xmath86 and @xmath87 fail to achieve consistency if @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath92 is highly convoluted due to the involvement of regression terms , making it difficult to establish consistency of @xmath93 .",
    "our strategy is to decompose the nonstochastic part of @xmath72 into several layers whose first three leading orders are @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , and express the remainder stochastic part as the sum of @xmath97 and two other terms that can be uniformly expressed as @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; see ( [ lemmaconvergea.s.0 ] ) .",
    "one distinctive characteristic of these nonstochastic layers is that the coefficient associated with the @xmath100th ( @xmath101 ) leading layer only depends on @xmath102 .",
    "when ( [ assumptionofmisselected ] ) is assumed , this hierarchical layer structure together with some uniform bounds established for the second moments of @xmath103 enables us to derive the consistency of @xmath93 in the order of @xmath84 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 by focusing on one layer and one parameter at a time .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the trace of a matrix @xmath107 . as shown in the proof of theorem  [ thmconsistency ] , the uniform bounds for @xmath103",
    "are first expressed in terms the supremums of @xmath108 , or other similar trace terms such as those given in ( [ pfthm01eq01 ] ) .",
    "these expressions are obtained using the idea that the sup - norms of a sufficiently smooth function can be bounded above by suitable integral norms , as suggested in lai @xcite , chan and ing @xcite and chan , huang and ing @xcite .",
    "we then carefully calculate the orders of magnitude of the aforementioned traces , yielding uniform bounds in terms of @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "note that dahlhaus @xcite has applied the chaining lemma ( see pollard @xcite ) to obtain uniform probability bounds for some quadratic forms of a discrete time long - memory process .",
    "however , since no rates have been reported in his bounds , his approach may not be directly applicable here .",
    "whereas theorem  [ thmconsistency ] has demonstrated the performance of @xmath53 from the perspective of consistency , the questions of what are the convergence rates of and whether there are central limit theorems ( clts ) for @xmath111 , still remain unanswered .",
    "the next section is devoted to these questions .",
    "in particular , it is shown in theorem  [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] that for @xmath112 , @xmath101 , @xmath113 if @xmath114 , and @xmath115 has a limiting normal distribution if @xmath116 . since the time trend is involved , our proof of theorem  [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] is somewhat nonstandard .",
    "we first obtain the initial convergence rates of @xmath93 using the standard taylor expansion and an argument similar but subtler than the one used in the proof of theorem  [ thmconsistency ] .",
    "using these initial rates , we can improve the convergence results through the same argument .",
    "we then repeat this iterative procedure until the final convergence results are established .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we begin by establishing the clt for @xmath111 in situations where @xmath117 is fixed and the regression model is correctly specified ( namely , ( [ correct ] ) is true ) ; see theorem  [ thmctlundertruemodel ] .",
    "we subsequently drop these two restrictions and report in theorem  [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] the most general convergence results of this paper . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we provide two counterexamples showing that the results obtained in theorem  [ thmconsistency ] are difficult to improve .",
    "the proofs of all theorems and corollaries in the first three sections are given in section  [ sectionproofoftheoremsandcorollaries ] .",
    "the proofs of the auxiliary lemmas used in section  [ sectionproofoftheoremsandcorollaries ] are provided in the supplementary material ( chang , huang and ing @xcite ) in light of space constraint . before leaving this section",
    ", we remark that although our results are derived under the gaussianity of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , similar results can be obtained when either @xmath118 or @xmath120 is not ( but pretended to be ) gaussian , provided some fourth moment information is available . on the other hand , while we allow the time trend to be misspecified , we preclude a misspecified covariance model .",
    "the interested reader is referred to xiu @xcite for some asymptotic results on the ml estimators when the covariance model considered in stein @xcite or at - sahalia , mykland and zhang @xcite is misspecified .",
    "in this section , we begin with establishing the asymptotic normality of @xmath121 , in situations where the regression model is correctly specified and @xmath117 is fixed .",
    "[ thmctlundertruemodel ] assume that ( [ correct ] ) holds and @xmath117 is a fixed nonnegative integer .",

    "straightforward calculations show that under the assumption of theorem  [ thmctlundertruemodel ] , the diagonal elements of the fisher information matrix evaluated at @xmath126 are given by @xmath127 where the trace terms are solely contributed by the log - density ( log - likelihood ) function for @xmath71 ( defined in ( [ logpdfe+e ] ) ) , and the @xmath128 terms , which vanish if the time trend is known to be zero , are related to the model complexity . moreover , by ( [ sigma1sigmainverse2 ] ) , ( [ diffsigma1sigmainverse ] ) and ( [ sigma1sigmainverse4 ] ) , @xmath129 it is interesting pointing out that the denominator on the right - hand side of the first equation of  ( [ fisherview ] ) coincides exactly with the limiting variance in ( [ thmtheta1consistency ] ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of a conventional asymptotic theory for the ml estimate which says that the limiting variance of the ml estimate is the reciprocal of the corresponding fisher information number . on the other hand , while the reciprocals of the right - hand sides of the second and third identities of ( [ fisherview ] ) are the same as the limiting variances in ( [ thmtheta2consistency ] ) and ( [ thmtheta3consistency ] ) , the divergence rates of the corresponding trace terms @xmath130 and @xmath110 are much slower than @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , they are equal to the divergence rates of the second and third leading layers of the nonstochastic part of @xmath131 ; see ( [ lemmaconvergea.s.0 ] ) .",
    "these findings reveal that the amounts of information related to @xmath132 s have different orders of magnitude , thereby leading to different normalizing constants in the clts for @xmath133 s .",
    "the next theorem improves theorem  [ thmctlundertruemodel ] by deriving rates of convergence of @xmath134 , without requiring @xmath122 in ( [ assumptionofmisselected ] ) .",
    "it further shows that clts for @xmath134 , are still possible if the model misspecification / complexity associated with the time trend has an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .    [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] suppose that ( [ assumptionofmisselected ] ) is true .",
    "then for @xmath34 , @xmath137 and for @xmath124 , @xmath138 in addition , for @xmath34 , @xmath139 and for @xmath124 , @xmath140    recall that @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . it is shown in ( [ fisherview0 ] ) and ( [ fisherview ] ) that , ignoring the constant , the amount of information regarding @xmath132 contained in @xmath71 is @xmath144 , @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "as will become clear later , @xmath146 can be used to measure the amount of information contaminated by model misspecification / complexity ( again ignoring the constant ) .",
    "therefore , the first part of theorem  [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] delivers nothing more than the simple idea that @xmath147 provided that @xmath148 \\label{maincondition } \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\quad<\\mbox{amount of information regarding } \\theta_{0,i } \\mbox { contained in } \\bolds\\eta+ \\bolds\\epsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ mainidea ] ) is the best rate one can expect when the time trend is known to be zero .",
    "the second part of theorem  [ thmctlunderincorrectmodel ] further indicates that the clts for @xmath133 s in theorem  [ thmctlundertruemodel ] carry over to situations where ( [ maincondition ] ) holds with the right - hand side replaced by its square root . to the best of our knowledge ,",
