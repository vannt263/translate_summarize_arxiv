    "understanding the nature of phase transitions in the parent superconductor compounds such as fe@xmath0te , bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 , and laofeas can elucidate the nature of magnetic and structural interactions in their respective superconducting phases .",
    "@xcite the chalcogenide system fe@xmath0te@xmath7 ( where @xmath8 se or s ) is particularly illuminating due to its simple crystal structure and since it allows two chemical variables to control properties : @xmath1 represents the amount of interstitial iron disordered throughout the crystal , and @xmath9 the amount of anion substitution .",
    "several studies have found that the two variables are correlated,@xcite and new chemical methods have been successfully utilized to independently control @xmath1.@xcite experimental studies on the effects of interstitial iron on magnetic , crystallographic , and transport properties of fe@xmath0te should shed further light on the microscopic mechanism leading to superconductivity as they answer basic questions such as the universality class of the magnetic interactions between the iron cations and whether the magnetic and structural transitions are coupled .     the magnetic and structural phase transitions in fe@xmath0te as a function of interstitial iron @xmath1 .",
    "the first - order transition from paramagnetic to commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering corresponds to a tetragonal @xmath10 to monoclinic @xmath11 transition .",
    "the second - order transition to an incommensurate helimagnet corresponds to an orthorhombic @xmath12 distortion .",
    "the tricritical point is hence close to @xmath13 . ]    in the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors , the magnetic ordering transitions are always proximate to the crystallographic phase transitions , with the notable exception being fese.@xcite the nature of these transitions are useful for evaluating the dimensionality of the magnetic and structural degrees of freedom .",
    "below 140 k , the tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath14 ) of bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 is lowered to an orthorhombic one ( @xmath15 ) , which is concomitant with an antiferromagnetic transition.@xcite the nature ( ie .",
    "first or second order ) of this transition is not without controversy as some groups describe it as a continuous and second - order transition,@xcite while others as a first - order transition.@xcite . in other analogues of the 122-system such as ca@xcite , sr,@xcite , and eu@xcite ,",
    "the transition has been consistently described as first - order .",
    "_ , however , have argued that srfe@xmath6as@xmath6 and eufe@xmath6as@xmath6 are actually second - order transitions , although this conclusion will require further verification since the critical exponent for the sr case is much smaller than that expected of a 2-d ising system.@xcite    in contrast to the 122 family of compounds , in the reofeas ( where re = rare earth ) system the magnetic transition @xmath5 does not coincide with the structural transition @xmath16 . both transitions are thought to be second - order and the gap between them increases upon doping to reach the superconducting state in the phase diagram .",
    "interestingly , wilson _",
    "et al . _ have found that although the two transitions occur at different temperatures in the same system , the order parameters corresponding to each have similar critical exponents that are close to @xmath17.@xcite furthermore , in lightly doped 122-phases , the transition temperatures are also separated as in the 1111-system , and their critical exponents become more indicative of three - dimensional behavior as well .",
    "therefore , the question becomes whether these systems must crossover from 2d - like behavior in the parent phases to 3d behavior in order for superconductivity to be achieved .",
    "the state of understanding these transitions in fe@xmath0te has been complicated by the fact that the amount of interstitial iron @xmath1 has a significant effect on the magnetic ordering and crystallographic phase transitions.@xcite it is well established from neutron diffraction,@xcite specific heat,@xcite magnetization , and transport studies@xcite that for samples with @xmath18 , the transition is first - order .",
    "the lower temperature monoclinic symmetry @xmath11 is not a subgroup of the higher temperature tetragonal space group @xmath10 .",
    "thus , landau - ginzburg theory would preclude this transition from being second - order on grounds that the symmetry change does not occur through a single irreducible representation .",
    "for samples with @xmath19 , the nature of these transitions becomes complicated since it has been found that the magnetic propagation vector does not vary smoothly with @xmath1 .",
    "instead , at a special composition of @xmath20 , the wave vector becomes an incommensurate spin density wave , and electronic phase separation occurs.@xcite for values of @xmath21 , the transition is better understood to be second - order from specific heat and transport studies.@xcite    in order to better understand the nature of these phase transitions in fete , we have performed temperature dependent neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "we then characterize the transport and specific heat of two single crystal samples to complete a picture of the phase diagram for fe@xmath0te .",
    "the main features describing the transition temperatures , magnetic ordering , electronic behavior , and nature / order of the phase transitions can be found in fig . [ fete_phases ] .",
    "a tricritical - like point is found in the phase diagram where a first - order transition gives way to second - order transition as the amount of interstitial iron is increased . in this paper , we characterize the structural , magnetic and electronic properties of this transition in detail with the goal of experimentally mapping out the properties of this transition .",
    "based on the coupling we observe between magnetic , structural , and electronic properties , we conclude that interstitial iron acts as a charge dopant altering the fermi surface nesting and dramatically changing the metallic properties .    the paper is divided into three sections with the first outlining the experiments , the second discussing the results throughout the phase diagram , and the third providing a summary and conclusions .",
    "neutron elastic and inelastic scattering results outline the changes observed in the magnetic structure and excitations in the three regions of the phase diagram ; 1 ) commensurate antiferromagnetic region ( @xmath2211% ) ; 2 ) near the tricritcal - like point ( @xmath2311% ) ; 3 ) heavily iron doped samples ( @xmath2411% ) . given that the tricritical point separates a phase described by a commensurate wavevector from an incommensurate one , it is defined as a lifshitz point .",
    "indeed , other transition metal systems have expressed such a point in their rich magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "for example , the magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram in mnp reveals such a lifshitz point at the intersection of para , ferro , and complex incommensurate magnetism .",
    "the powder samples used for these studies were prepared by mixing stoichiometric ratios of iron and tellurium powders and heating them in evacuated quartz glass ampoules up to 400 @xmath25 c for 12 hours followed by 700 @xmath25 c for several days before furnace cooling . for samples with @xmath26 , a second reaction with more iron powder",

    "the high resolution capabilities provided by hrpd combined with the direct coupling between neutrons and the magnetic spin allowed both magnetic and structural properties to be tracked simultaneously with temperature .",

    "on hb-3a , the sample was heated from 4 to 46 k in 1 k steps followed by 0.5 k steps up to 68 k and then 1 k steps were used up to 80 k. a 5 minute wait between temperatures was used .",
    "for both hb-3a and hrpd , a temperature stability of better than 0.15 k was achieved for the measurements . in the analysis presented ,",

    "<S> fe@xmath0te undergoes two transitions : the higher temperature one is a second - order transition to an orthorhombic phase with incommensurate magnetic ordering and temperature - dependent propagation vector , while the lower temperature one corresponds to nucleation of a monoclinic phase with a nearly commensurate magnetic wavevector . while both structural and magnetic transitions display similar critical behavior for @xmath2 and near the critical concentration of @xmath4 , samples with large interstitial iron concentrations show a marked deviation between the critical response indicating a decoupling of the order parameters . </S>",
