    "gravitational lensing provides an invaluable means to investigate how luminous and dark matter is distributed in the universe , from inside our own galaxy to cosmological scales [ e.g. alcock ( 2000 ) , keeton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ] . in this paper",
    "we focus on clusters in the weak lensing regime , where the number density and shapes of faint background galaxies are changed through the magnification and shear effects respectively .",
    "these signatures can be used to determine the projected mass distribution of the lensing cluster .",
    "the pioneering work of kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) describes how to obtain a parameter - free reconstruction of a mass distribution , and this technique has been applied to many clusters [ e.g. fischer & tyson 1997 ; clowe et al .",
    "1998 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ; clowe et al .",
    "2000 ; hoekstra , franx & kuijken 2000 ] .",
    "in contrast to parameterised models , the interpretation of such mass maps is difficult since the error properties of non - parametric models are poorly understood .",
    "although deriving parameterised cluster models from weak lensing data may not reveal the lensing mass distribution in the same detail , it enables different families of models to be explored , and statistical comparisons between clusters to be made .    in schneider , king & erben ( 2000 ; hereafter ske ) we investigated parameterised cluster models and developed likelihood techniques to quantify the accuracy with which parameters can be recovered using the magnification and shear information .",
    "two simple but generic families of power - law models for the surface mass density were studied .",
    "the basic model has a monotonically decreasing form , and is defined outside the einstein radius ( @xmath1 ) , which marks the transition between the weak and strong lensing regimes .",
    "here we extend this work to encompass two other parameterised lens models that are commonly used to describe cluster mass profiles : the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996;1997 ) , and the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) as discussed by kormann , schneider & bartelmann ( 1994 ) .",
    "the impetus for considering the nfw profile is that it is a good description of the radial density profiles of virialised dark matter halos formed in cosmological simulations of hierarchical clustering .",
    "the sie model allows us to investigate non - spherically symmetric dark matter distributions .",
    "the influence of uncertainty in the redshift distribution of galaxies used in the lensing analysis is examined , in the context of nfw clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "a question of fundamental importance to the study of galaxy and cluster formation , and to the nature of dark matter itself , is how profiles can best be described [ e.g. moore et al .",
    "therefore , we investigate whether we can distinguish between nfw and power - law models , and the constraints that can be placed on sie models .",
    "we also briefly address the influence of substructure on our analysis , by comparing the smooth nfw profile with a toy model containing substructure .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the notation and lensing relationships used are outlined in section 2 , followed by the basis of using the magnification and shear methods in constraining a cluster mass profile . in section 3 , the likelihood functions developed in ske are briefly presented . moving to clusters at higher redshifts , several scenarios for our knowledge of the source redshift distribution are described .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed in order to check the validity of the analytic treatment , and to deal with cases where the redshift distribution is important ; a prescription for these is given in section 4 .",
    "the relevant properties of the lens models considered in this work are also given in this section .",
    "the results from the likelihood analysis in the case of lower redshift clusters are presented in section 5 . for the nfw profile , proceeding as in ske , we check the validity of the assumption of @xmath2 statistics .",
    "also , a brief comparison is made between the accuracy of parameters recovered using the magnification and shear information .",
    "then the shear method becomes the focus and we ask whether it is possible to distinguish between the nfw and other profiles , using our likelihood analysis .",
    "moving to the sie model , we want to ascertain how well the axial ratio of a mass distribution is recovered  can we detect deviation from circular symmetry and put constraints on the position angle of the lens model ? the results for nfw clusters at higher redshifts , for different degrees of source redshift information , are presented in section 6 .",
    "lastly , we consider what effect adding substructure to the smooth nfw model has on our analysis . in the final section we summarise our conclusions .",
    "in this section the notation used throughout this paper is introduced , along with the basic definitions and relationships .",
    "then the methods for constraining the mass profile of a lens using the shape distortions and the change in the number density of background galaxies are outlined .      throughout ,",
    "standard lensing notation is used [ eg schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ; bartelmann & schneider ( 2000 ) ] .",
    "the strength of a lens depends on the relative redshifts of the observer , lens and source , and as in seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) it is convenient to introduce a redshift dependent lensing strength factor @xmath17",
    ". then we can express @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to quantities at position @xmath3 for hypothetical sources located at @xmath22 . in the einstein - de sitter @xmath23 cosmology which we adopt , @xmath24  of course , @xmath25 when @xmath26 since the source is not lensed .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 and @xmath30^{2}-[w(z)\\gamma_{\\infty}]^{2}}\\ ] ] respectively . in ske",
    "we considered the case of fairly low redshift clusters where @xmath17 is nearly constant for most galaxies used in the lensing analysis , and the differential probability distribution @xmath31 ( equivalent to @xmath32 ) is a very narrow distribution .",
    "then , the redshift distribution of the source galaxy population can safely be neglected , approximating them to be located at a redshift corresponding to the mean value of @xmath17 .",
    "if the cluster is at a higher redshift , @xmath33 say , then the redshift distribution of the galaxies becomes important and this sheet approximation is no longer robust ( bartelmann & schneider 2000 ) .    throughout",
    ", we take @xmath34 .",
    "the galaxy ellipticity @xmath35 is defined by a complex number whose modulus is @xmath36 , in the case of elliptical isophotes with axis ratio @xmath37 , and whose phase is twice the position angle of the major axis .",
    "a gaussian probability distribution with dispersion @xmath38 is adopted for the ellipticity    @xmath39}\\;.\\ ] ]    a transformation relates the source ( @xmath40 ) and image ( @xmath35 ) ellipticities , which are changed by the tidal gravitational field of the lens .",
    "we focus on the non - critical regime ( det @xmath41 ) where    @xmath42    the lensed and unlensed probability distributions are related through @xmath43 when the distribution in source redshift is unimportant [ see eq.([redinfo ] ) for the more general form ] .",
    "it can be shown that the expectation value for the lensed ellipticity @xmath44 in the non - critical regime ( e.g. schramm & kayser 1995 ) , and that @xmath45 in the critical regime ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) .",
    "this is the basis of the using the distorted images of background galaxies to constrain the cluster model .",
    "the magnification method is based on the change in the local number counts of background galaxies by the magnification bias ( e.g. canizares 1982 ) .",
    "the local cumulative number counts @xmath46 above flux limit @xmath47 are related to the unlensed counts @xmath48 by @xmath49 if we assume that the number counts locally follow a power law of the form @xmath50 , then @xmath51 at any fixed flux threshold .",
    "this implies that if the intrinsic counts are flatter than @xmath52 , then the lensed counts will be reduced relative to the unlensed ones .",
    "the goal of our likelihood treatment is to obtain the best - fitting parameters and their error estimates for simulated or real observations [ see for example press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ] . generally , it is more sensible computationally to minimise log - likelihood functions to obtain the best - fitting parameters , since a large number of galaxies is involved .",
    "whereas a log - likelihood function pertains to a single data set or realisation , ensemble averaged log - likelihood functions represent the average over many such realisations , and enable the characteristic ( expected ) errors associated with the recovered parameters to be estimated .",
    "we consider cluster lenses described by parameterised models , with true parameters @xmath53 , best - fit parameters @xmath54 , and trial parameters ( en route to minimisation ) @xmath55 throughout .",
    "quantities that refer to the true model value are subscripted with a ",
    "t \" , and those referring to observed values are subscripted with an  @xmath56 \" .",
    "we assume that in an aperture centred on the cluster there are @xmath57 images of background galaxies at positions @xmath58 , above a given flux limit , and @xmath59 images at positions @xmath60 for which an ellipticity can be measured .",
    "there can be an overlap between the two sets of galaxies .      here",
    "the expressions for the likelihood functions and ensemble averaged log - likelihood functions are reproduced ; the reader is referred to ske for the details and derivations .",
    "minimising these functions gives @xmath54 , the most likely parameters given the observations . in the absence of a redshift distribution for the background sources , the magnification log - likelihood function is @xmath61^{\\beta-1}+(1-\\beta)\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\mu}}{\\rm\\ln\\;}\\mu(\\vc\\theta_{i})\\;. \\label{likmag}\\ ] ] the noise in the magnification method is due to poisson noise on the number of galaxies in the aperture .",
    "the first term in eq.([likmag ] ) dominates the expression , and gives the number of galaxies expected in the aperture , given @xmath55 . given this number of galaxies , the second term depends on how they are distributed",
    ". one noteworthy caveat of the magnification method that we uncovered in ske is that it requires accurate knowledge of the unlensed number density , @xmath62 .",
    "the shear log - likelihood function is @xmath63 and the noise in this method arises from the intrinsic dispersion in the galaxy ellipticity distribution , @xmath64 .",
    "eq.([liksh ] ) just depends on how probable particular lensed ellipticities are , given the @xmath55 under consideration . unlike the magnification method",
    ", the shear method does not require that the unlensed number density is accurately known .",
    "eq.([liksh ] ) can be used numerically with the exact probability distribution for @xmath65 , but for analytic work the log - likelihood function @xmath66 can be dealt with as @xmath67 where @xmath68 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "this approximation is accurate to @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "the combined shear and magnification log - likelihood is obtained by adding the respective log - likelihoods : @xmath72    as mentioned above , the ensemble averaged log - likelihood functions allow the characteristic errors for parameters to be derived .",
    "the ensemble averaged log - likelihood function for the magnification is @xmath73^{\\beta-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & n_{\\mu}(1-\\beta)\\int\\d^{2}\\theta\\ ; [ \\mu_{\\t}(\\vc\\theta)]^{\\beta-1}\\,\\ln\\mu(\\vc\\theta)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the magnification determined for @xmath53 .",
    "for the shear we have @xmath75^{\\beta-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\rund{{|g(\\vc\\vt)-g_{\\t}(\\vc\\vt)|^2+\\sigma_{\\eps,\\t}^{2}(\\vc\\vt)\\over \\sigma_{\\eps}^{2}(\\vc\\vt)}+2\\ln\\sigma_{\\eps}(\\vc\\vt)}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath76 and @xmath77 are determined for @xmath53 .",
    "we have numerically implemented the expressions for the ensemble averaged log - likelihood functions which means that for specified observing conditions ( i.e. @xmath78 , @xmath62 and size of the data field ) the characteristic errors on parameterised models can easily be obtained .",
    "this is helpful when assessing the benefits of current telescopes with different cameras , or future ground- or space - based instruments .    in section 5",
    "we demonstrate that the distribution of @xmath79 for @xmath54 tends to a @xmath80 distribution , where @xmath81 is the number of model parameters , so that error interpretation in the framework of gaussian distributed errors is a good approximation .      for clusters at intermediate and high redshifts",
    "there are several ways to proceed when obtaining best - fit parameters , depending on our knowledge of the individual background galaxy redshifts . in this section",
    "a few scenarios for the information on the redshift distribution are briefly outlined and in section 6 a comparison is made between the dispersion in parameters recovered under each assumption .",
    "let the true redshifts of the background sources , denoted by @xmath82 , be drawn from a probability distribution @xmath32 . here , the redshift probability distribution used to generate catalogues of lensed galaxies",
    "is taken from brainerd et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : @xmath83 where below it is assumed that @xmath84 and @xmath85 , resulting in @xmath86 .    in its most general form , in the presence of a redshift distribution @xmath87",
    "becomes @xmath88\\right)\\left     & \\times & p_{z}(z){\\rm d}z \\label{redinfo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this is inserted into the likelihood function .",
    "eq.([redinfo ] ) is very difficult to deal with analytically , as discussed by geiger & schneider ( 1998 ) who give some approximations for the integral .    in this work",
    "we explore a few different routes :    * for the purposes of comparison , the ideal case is where * ( i ) all redshifts are known exactly*. * second ,",
    "we consider the situation where * ( ii ) photometric redshift estimates * @xmath89 * are available for individual galaxies*. * a common practice in mass reconstruction is to assume that * ( iii ) the galaxies used in the lensing analysis are at a single redshift @xmath90 * , determined by the arithmetic mean of the weighting factor @xmath91 .",
    "* another computationally reasonable possibility is to assume that * ( iv ) the form of * @xmath92 * is known * , but not the redshifts of individual sources , and to integrate ( [ redinfo ] ) numerically .",
    "the availability of photometric redshift estimates is becoming more observationally realistic [ e.g. connolly et al .",
    "1995 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999 ; bentez 2000 ] and has a great impact on lensing ( e.g. dye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "obviously , the smaller the dispersion @xmath93 in @xmath89 , the smaller the dispersion in @xmath54 .",
    "this can be quantified with a simple estimate : the lensed probability distribution @xmath94 is convolved with the gaussian describing the distribution of @xmath89 around @xmath82 . in the weak lensing limit , @xmath95 so it is convenient to work with @xmath96 rather than @xmath6 , where the dispersion in @xmath97 is @xmath98 . further using @xmath99 gives @xmath100 the integration can approximately be replaced by one between @xmath101 and @xmath102 yielding @xmath103 where the dispersion @xmath104 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath105 can be considered as an effective dispersion @xmath106 . in terms of the effect on lensing ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath107 is of interest .",
    "even for @xmath21=0.3 , and taking a very large value of @xmath98 = 0.18 , @xmath108 is only 15% larger than for the case when the source redshifts are known exactly .    when sources are assumed to be at @xmath90 , this results in an expected reduced shear @xmath109 .",

    "below we describe how the lensing simulations were carried out . in the case of lower redshift clusters , these simulations were used to check the validity of the ensemble average analytic treatment in putting confidence limits on @xmath54 . for higher redshift clusters ,",
    "simulations were used in conjunction with analytic approximations in order to determine the accuracy with which parameters can be recovered . following this ,",
    "the main features of the lens models used in the likelihood analysis are outlined .",
    "it is assumed that the observations are made in a circular aperture of inner radius @xmath113 and outer radius @xmath114 centred on the cluster . the number density of background galaxies for which an ellipticity can be measured , and can therefore be used for the shear method , is @xmath78 , and the number density that can be used for the magnification method is @xmath62 . unless otherwise stated , @xmath115 ( the typical number density used for shear analysis of deep ground - based data ) and @xmath116 ( similar to fort et al .",

    "finally , the catalogue contains @xmath58 , @xmath122 and @xmath125 for each lensed galaxy , representing a single data set .",
    "the log - likelihood functions are then minimised to obtain @xmath54 for the catalogues , either using the lens model family used to generate the data set , or for a different family of models when we want to see how well families can be distinguished .",
