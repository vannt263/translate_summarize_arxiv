    "this paper is concerned with many body systems and their cooperative behaviour ; in particular when that behaviour is complex and hard to anticipate from the microscopics , even qualitatively and even when the systems are made up of simple individual units with simple inter - unit interactions .",
    "` range - free ' ( or ` infinite - ranged ' ) refers to situations where the interactions are not dependent on the physical separations of individual units , and hence neither on the dimensionality nor on the structure of the embedding space .",
    "such systems are also often referred to as ` mean - field ' , since one can often show ( and usually believes ) that their behaviour in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath0 units ) is identical to that of an appropriate mean - field approximation to a short - range system .    `",
    "frustration ' refers to incompatability between different microscopic ordering tendencies .",
    "self - consistent mean - field theories do have the ability to describe spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions and they have played an important role in statistical physics .",
    "however as pure systems , without quenched hamiltonian disorder or out - of - equilibrium self - induced disorder , they do not exhibit the interesting non - simple dimension - dependent but details - independent ( universal ) critical behaviour whose study drove much of the interest of statistical mechanics in the seventies and eighties @xcite .",
    "for this reason ` mean - field ' used to be interpreted as fairly trivial .    on the other hand , with quenched disorder and frustration in their interactions range - free many - body systems",
    "can , and regularly do , exhibit behaviour that is complex and rich .",
    "this paper represents a brief introduction to and partial overview of such systems .",
    "the general class of systems we consider can be summarized as characterised by schematic ` control functions ' of the form @xmath1 where ( i ) in thermodynamics ( statics ) the @xmath2 are the variables and the @xmath3 are quenched ( frozen ) parameters , or vice - versa , ( ii ) in dynamics the @xmath2 are the ` fast ' variables and the @xmath3 are ` slow ' variables , or vice - versa , where ` fast ' and ` slow ' refer to the characteristic microscopic time - scales , ( iii ) in both cases , the @xmath4 are intensive control parameters , influencing the system deterministically , quenched - randomly or stochastically , and ( iv ) we shall be particularly interested in typical behaviour in situations in which any quenched disorder is drawn independently from identical intensive distributions , enabling ( at least in principle ) useful thermodynamic - limit measures of the macroscopic behaviour .",
    "the interest arises when the effects of different interactions are ` frustrated ' , in competition with one another . in such cases with detailed balance , at low enough noise",
    "the macrostate structure / space is typically fractured ( or clustered ) , in a manner often envisaged in terms of a ` rugged landscape ' paradigm in which the dynamics is imagined as motion in a very high dimensional landscape of exponentially many hills and valleys , often hierarchically structured , with concomitant confinements , slow dynamics and history dependence . in dynamical systems without detailed balance , strictly there is no such simple lyapunov ` landscape ' but the ` motion ' is analogously complexly hindered , with many effective macroscopic time - scales .",
    "first studied ( in physics ) in the context of magnetic alloys , such systems are now recognised in many different contexts ; in inanimate physical systems , computer science , and information science ; in animate biology , economics and social science . in these different systems ` controllers ' of the ` control functions ' vary ; including the laws of physics , devisors of computer algorithms , human behaviour , governmentally - devised laws etc .",
    "a simply - formulated but richly - behaved canonical model is that of sherrington and kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite , originally introduced as a potentially soluble model corresponding to a novel mean - field theory introduced by edwards and anderson ( ea ) @xcite to capture the essential physics of some unusual magnetic alloys , known as spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the sk model is characterized by a hamiltonian @xmath5 where the @xmath6 label spins @xmath7 , taken for simplicity as ising , and the interactions @xmath8 are chosen randomly and independently from a distribution @xmath9 .",
    "dynamically the system can be considered to follow any standard single - spin - flip dynamics corresponding to a temperature @xmath10 . were normal equilibration to occur it",
    "would be characterized by boltzmann - gibbs statistics , @xmath11 .    however ,",
    "if the distribution @xmath12 has sufficient variance compared with its mean and the temperature is sufficiently low , normal equilibration does not occur and complex macro - behaviour results beneath a transition temperature .",
    "the interesting regime , known as the ` spin glass phase ' , occurs at intensive @xmath10 if the variance of @xmath12 scales with @xmath13 as @xmath14 , the mean as @xmath15 .",
    "as parisi showed , in a series of papers ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) which involved amazing insight and highly original conceptualization and methodology , this glassy state is characterized by a hierarchy of ` metastable ' macrostates , differences between restricted and gibbsian thermodynamic averages , as well as non - self - averaging ; see also _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "these features can be characterized by the macrostate overlap distribution functions @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a thermodynamic average of @xmath18 over the macrostate @xmath19 . for a conventional system , with a single macrostate",
    ", @xmath20 has a single delta function , while for a system with entropically extensively many macrostates @xmath20 has more structure . when the state structure is continuously hierarchical , as it is for sk , there is a continuum of weight in the disorder - averaged overlap distribution function @xmath21 p_{\\{j_{ij}\\}}(q)$ ] .",
    "non - self - averaging arises in different @xmath22 for different realizations of quenched disorder even when that disorder is chosen _ i.i.d .",
    "_ from an intensive @xmath12 .",
    "ultrametricity @xcite is a feature of the hierarchical order .",
    "later studies @xcite have further exposed the existence of slow dynamics and aging and a remarkable non - trivial quantitative relationship to the thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "one feature of this is a modification of the normal fluctuation - dissipation relationship to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a response function and @xmath25 a related correlation function , parenthetically connected through the measurement time @xmath26 in the limits of large initial waiting time / field application time @xmath27 and @xmath26 itself , and @xmath28 is related to the average overlap distribution @xmath29 by @xmath30 . in the normal fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath28 is replaced by unity .",
    "the original exposure of the subtleties of the sk model utilised unusual and non - rigorous mathematics and anstze , together with unconventional physical conceptualization , going far beyond the conventional realms of rigorous mathematical physics and probability theory .",
    "the predictions have however long been shown to be in accord with computer simulations of the model ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and consequently were believed by physicists .",
    "their rigorous demonstration , though , has been a non - trivial challenge which has required deep analysis and led to new rigorous mathematical methodologies in recent years @xcite , finally completely vindicating parisi s theory @xcite .",
    "thus there is no doubt that there is deep complexity in the sk model .    on the other hand , while it is generally believed that real spin glass transitions do occur also in the short - ranged ea model for dimensions three or more and also in the experimental magnetic alloys that first stimulated its study , it remains controversial as to whether or to what extent all the subtle predictions of the sk model apply to these systems ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "hence it becomes appropriate to ask whether range - free frustrated and disordered systems have a wider relevance beyond as over - idealized models of real magnetic alloys and as challenges for mathematicians .",
    "possibly remarkably , it turns out that the answer is a resounding `` yes '' ; they turn out to be rather ubiquitous in many areas of science .",
    "range - free frustrated and disordered many - body problems occur in many scenarios outside of physics , for example in many of the hard optimization problems studied by computer scientists , and in situations in which correlation between individuals occurs through the transfer of information available to all , irrespective of physical separation , as epitomised by modern interaction through the internet and telephones , or commonly available through the world - wide web , newspapers , radio and television .",
    "these systems are usually different in detail from the sk model but share some of the same conceptual and technical challenges , as well as providing further challenges of their own .",
    "a simple illustration of the the possibilities of extension comes from viewing the sk model as an optimization problem which is describable in everyday terms as  the dean s problem \" @xcite .",
    "one imagines a university dean who has to place @xmath13 students in two dormitories , but with the challenge that every pair of students @xmath31 either likes or dislikes one another to an extent @xmath32 .",
    "corresponding to ` like ' and @xmath33 to dislike . ]",
    "his problem is to choose to which dorm to allocate each student so as to ensure the greatest satisfaction overall .",
    "labelling the dorm choices by @xmath34 the sk hamiltonian becomes the ` cost function ' that the dean should minimise , with the @xmath35 in its ground state the optimal choice . ] . allowing the dean a degree of uncertainty in his decision - making provides an analogue of ` temperature ' .",
    "there are many other combinatorial optimization problems that can be viewed as finding the minimum of a cost function of the form @xmath1 .    in a ` simulated annealing ' @xcite ` spin - flip ' computer algorithm to minimise the cost function , an annealing ` temperature ' @xmath36 is introduced artificially via a stochastic probability measure determined by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the change in the cost function engendered by the flip , so that equilibration at @xmath36 would yield the corresponding boltzmann distribution , and @xmath36 is gradually reduced to the value of interest ( zero for a minimum of @xmath39 , or @xmath10 if that is the stochastic noise of actual uncertainty ) .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath36 can be introduced into an effective equilibrium statistical mechanics , with boltzmann weighting @xmath40 , examined analytically and the minimum found from @xmath41      in the @xmath42-spin glass model one replaces the binary interaction of sk by one involving @xmath42 spins ; @xmath43 with the @xmath44 again drawn randomly and independently , all from the same distribution , and then quenched .",
    "yields an intensive transition temperaure . ]",
    "this apparently innocuous extension of the sk model yields new behaviour in several ways .",
    "firstly , instead of a continuous onset of a hierarchy of different levels of metastability , with a growing continuous range of state overlaps , there is a discontinuous onset of many orthogonal but otherwise equivalent metastates of finite overlap order parameter at @xmath45 in addition to the main delta - function peak at @xmath46 ; note that this is in contrast to a conventional ferromagnet ( or antiferromagnet ) for which the whole delta - function peak , which in the paramagnetic phase is at @xmath46 , would move to a finite value of @xmath47 .",
    "for a continuous transition @xmath20 develops extra finite weight growing continuously from @xmath46 , whereas in a discontinuous transition @xmath20 develops by acquiring weight directly at finite @xmath48 but with its weight growing continuously . in the case of @xmath49 ( sk )",
    "the ( continuous ) onset also has finite weight for a continuous range of @xmath47 within @xmath50 . for sk @xmath51 grows continuously with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transition temperature . for @xmath54",
    "the initial onset is discontinuous at a single finite @xmath51.]@xcite .",
    "secondly , the dynamical transition is no longer at the same temperature as the thermodynamic transition but is higher @xcite .",
    "thirdly , there is another lower temperature ( continuous ) thermodynamic transition to a state with a continuous range of overlap distributions @xcite .",
    "this type of behaviour , of a dynamical transition pre - empting a thermodynamic one , both with discontinuous onset of overlap , turns out to be rather common in frustrated many - body systems .",
    "so too is the lower temperature thermodynamic transition to a continuous range of overlap distributions .",
    "unbounded but with @xmath55 ) or for @xmath56 .",
    "] consequently the determination of the minimum achievable cost function often has the difficulties associated with the full hierarchical character of the sk model at @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , many of the problems of interest in computer science are effectively range - free but on random graphs of finite connectivity , in contrast to the full connectivity of the sk- and @xmath42- spin models of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) and ( [ eq : p - spin ] ) above .",
    "the conceptual ideas extend , albeit made more complicated ( and currently incompletely solved ) by the need for higher order overlap functions within the full ( replica ) theory of @xcite .- scaling to achieve finite transition temperatures ; the relevant criterion is scaling as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the graph coordination number . ]",
    "dilution , however , has also brought to the fore an alternative and highly successful computational methodology in the form of ` survey propagation ' @xcite .",
    "one example of the conceptual transfer of these ideas is to random satisfiability problems in computer science , both in explaining the existence of satisfiable - unsatisfiable ( sat - unsat ) phase transitions @xcite and in leading to the recognition that for random @xmath60-sat , where @xmath61 refers to the length of the individual clauses to be satisfied simultaneously , there should be a region of ` hard - sat ' separating practically satisfiable sat problems from unsat as the constraint density , the ratio of the number of constrained clauses to the number of variables , is increased @xcite ; this ratio can be considered as playing a role reminiscent of that of the inverse of temperature in the @xmath42-spin model with the transitions analogues of the @xmath42-spin dynamical and thermodynamic transitions .- sat maps to an ising spin glass model with terms of several @xmath62 .",
    "] in fact , on closer examination , random @xmath61-sat exhibits an even richer sequence of phase transions ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "it is possible to interpolate between the type of behaviour of the @xmath63 model and that of the @xmath49 sk model .",
    "one way is to add a magnetic field @xmath64 to the @xmath42-spin glass .",
    "this leads to a sequence of behaviours as @xmath64 is increased ; for small @xmath64 it is qualitatively as described above for the zero - field @xmath42-spin model , followed at a first critical field by the coming together of the dynamical and thermodynamic spin glass transitions and replacement of the discontinuous onset of non - trivial @xmath20 by a continuous one @xcite , but still with a single delta function onset at non - zero @xmath47 , in addition to that at @xmath46 , and then at a higher critical field by a transition to a continuously distributed hierarchy of metastable states and overlaps replaced by a non - symmetric potts interaction @xmath65 where @xmath42 is the potts dimensionality . in this case",
    "the sequence is from sk at @xmath49 to pure @xmath42-spin - glass - like at @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests a possible utility in adding an extra ` effective field ' in the computer algorithmic optimization , to avoid the dynamical pre - emption of a thermodynamic transition .",
    "another interesting class of range - free problems is of systems where many ` agents ' , each with individual characteristics but with no direct interactions between them , behave in a cooperatively complex fashion by all reacting to common ` information ' .",
    "this common information acts as an effectuator for correlation between the agents . frustration and complexity arise when the goals are such that not all can ` win ' .      a minimalist model that illustrates this class is the so - called ` minority game'(mg)@xcite , introduced to emulate some features of a stockmarket in which players make profits by buying when the price is low and selling when the price is high . in a simple version of this model",
    "@xmath13 agents at each time - step @xmath26 simultaneously make one of two choices , which we shall denote @xmath67 .",
    "their ` objectives ' are to make the minority choice .",
    "they make their choices on the basis of ( i ) some ` information ' @xmath68 commonly available to all , ( ii ) the operation on that information by each agent @xmath69 of one of a pair of individual strategy operators @xmath70 , with the output determining the ` choice ' made , ( iii ) individual ` point - scores ' @xmath71 that enable the agents to ` decide ' which of their two strategies to employ at each step .",
    "the strategy pairs are chosen randomly and independently at the outset and thereafter fixed .",
    "the information @xmath68 varies at each time - step and hence so does the outcome of the strategies acting upon it .",
    "the space of the strategies spans the two possible outputs equally . in the simplest deterministic version of the game",
    "the strategy @xmath72 employed by agent @xmath69 at time @xmath26 is that labelled by the same sign as @xmath71 .",

    "@xcite the information used was the booolean string indicating the minority choice in the previous @xmath78 time - steps of play and the @xmath79 were boolean operators .",
    "however , essentially similar behaviour is obtained for a system in which @xmath80 is randomly generated at each time @xmath26 , equally probably from the whole space of @xmath78 binaries @xcite .",
    "the most obviously relevant macroscopic measure in the mg is the volatility , the variance of the choices .",
    "computer simulations demonstrated that it has scaling behaviour , the volatility per agent versus the the information dimension per agent @xmath81 approaching independence of @xmath13 as the latter is increased , and also has a cusp - like minimum at a critical @xmath82 with behaviour ergodic for @xmath83 but non - ergodic for @xmath84 .",
    "fig 1 shows this behaviour for     ( circles ) , @xmath85 ( squares ) and @xmath86 ( diamonds ) , ( ii ) a comparison betweeen the results of simulation of the deterministic many - agent dynamics ( open symbols ) and the numerical evaluation of the analytically - derived stochastic single - agent ensemble dynamics . from @xcite . ]    a slightly different variant of the model in which the strategies are taken as @xmath87-dimensional binary strings @xmath88 with each component @xmath89 chosen randomly and independently at the outset and thereafter fixed ( quenched ) , and the stochastic ` information ' consists in randomly choosing @xmath90 at each time - step and then using the corresponding strategy elements .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behaviour of the susceptibility of the sk spin glass , shown in fig 2 ,    , as predicted by parisi theory .",
    "the upper curve shows the full gibbs average , obtained from the full @xmath91 and interpreted as the field - cooled ( fc ) susceptibility .",

    "if one compares the volatility with the inverse susceptibility and the information dimension with the temperature .",
    "hence one is tempted to analyze the mg using methodolgy developed for spin glasses .",
    "updating the point - score only after @xmath93 steps where @xmath94 leads to an averaging over the random information to produce an effective interaction between the agents and yield the so - called ` batch ' game ( with temporally - rescaled update dynamics ) @xmath95 where @xmath39 is an effective ` hamiltonian ' @xmath96 and @xmath32 and @xmath97 are effective ` exchange ' and ` field ' terms given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "since the @xmath100 are random so are the exchange and field terms .",
    "hence @xmath39 is a disordered and frustrated control function .",

    "there are two main methodologies employed to study statics , the replica procedure and the cavity method ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the most common method for the cooperative dynamics is the generating functional method @xcite .    in the replica method one",

    "the correct solution for the sk model requires parisi s much more subtle ansatz of replica symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this ansatz introduces a hierarchy of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) with a sequence of @xmath113 that in the limit of @xmath114 yields a continuous order function @xmath115 , later shown @xcite to be related to the average overlap distribution through @xmath116 .    the dynamical functional method for the sk model",

    "correspondingly there are further ` correlation lengths ' in temperature - deviation and in field - deviation , which of course also determine the extent of rsb needed to get a good approximation as temperature or field become non - zero .",
    "in this short paper it has only been possible to present a brief and non - detailed vignette of the complexity that can and does exist in disordered and frustrated many - body systems , even within a dimension - free mean - field situation .",
