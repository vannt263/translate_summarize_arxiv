    "gravitational waves are thought to be produced by astrophysical phenomena ranging from the coalescence of orbiting binaries to violent events in the early universe .",
    "their detection would herald a new window for the observation of natural phenomena .",
    "great ingenuity is being exercised in attempts to detect such waves in the vicinity of the earth using either laser interferometry or various resonant mass devices following weber s pioneering efforts with aluminum cylinders . due to the masking effects of competing influences and the weakness of gravitation compared with the electromagnetic interactions the threshold for the detection of expected gravitationally induced signals remains tantalisingly close to the limits set by currently technology . in order to achieve the signal to noise ratios needed for the unambiguous detection of gravitational waves numerous alternative strategies are also under consideration .",
    "these include more sophisticated transducer interfaces , advanced filtering techniques and the use of dedicated arrays of antennae .",
    "earth based gravitational wave detectors require expensive vibration insulation in order to discriminate the required signals from the background .",
    "this is one reason why the use of antennae in space offer certain advantages .",
    "it is argued here that the gravitationally induced elastodynamic vibrations of slender material structures in space offer other advantages that do not appear to have been considered .",
    "multiple structures of such continua possess attractive properties when used as coincidence detectors of gravitational disturbances with a dominant spectral content in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 hz region .",
    "furthermore this window can be readily extended to lower frequencies and higher sensitivities by enlarging the size of the structures .",
    "newtonian elastodynamics @xcite is adequate as a first approximation if supplemented by the",
    "_ tidal stresses _ generated by the presence of spacetime curvature that is small in comparison with the size of the detector .",
    "the latter are estimated from the accelerations responsible for spacetime geodesic deviations .",
    "since the constituents of material media owe their elasticity to primarily non - gravitational forces their histories are non - geodesic .",
    "the geodesic motions of particles offer a reference configuration and the geodesic deviation of neighbours in a geodesic reference frame provide accelerations that are additionally resisted in a material held together by elastic forces .",
    "since in practical situations the re - radiation of gravitational waves is totally negligible the computation of the stresses induced by the tidal tensor of a background incident gravitational wave offers a viable means of exploring the dynamical response of a material domain to a fluctuating gravitational field .",
    "current resonant mode detectors are designed to permit reconstruction of the direction and polarisation of gravitational waves that can excite resonances @xcite .",
    "clearly such detectors are designed to respond to a narrow spectral window of gravitational radiation and are not particularly good at determining the temporal profile of incident gravitational pulses .",
    "a significant advantage of space - based antennae based on slender material structures is that they can be designed to respond to transient gravitational pulses , to polarised uni - directional gravitational waves or omni - directional unpolarised waves .    the general mathematical theory of non - linear newtonian elasticity is well established .",
    "the general theory of one - dimensional newtonian cosserat continua derived as limits of three - dimensional continua can be consulted in @xcite .",
    "the theory is fundamentally formulated in the lagrangian picture in which material elements are labelled by @xmath2 .",
    "the behaviour of a cosserat rod at time @xmath3 may be described in terms of the motion @xmath4 in space of the line of centroids of its cross - sections and elastic deformations about that line .",
    "such a rod is modelled mathematically by an elastic space - curve with structure .",
    "this structure defines the relative orientation of neighbouring cross - sections along the rod .",
    "specifying a unit vector @xmath5 ( which may be identified with the normal to the cross - section ) at each point along the rod enables the state of shear to be related to the angle between this vector and the tangent to the space - curve . specifying a second vector @xmath6 orthogonal to the first vector ( thereby placing it in the plane of the cross - section ) can be used to encode the state of flexure and twist along its length .",
    "thus a field of two mutually orthogonal unit vectors along the structure provides three continuous dynamical degrees of freedom that , together with the continuous three degrees of freedom describing a space - curve relative to some arbitrary origin in space , define a simple cosserat model ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is significant for this approach that the theory includes thermal variables that can be coupled to the dynamical equations of motion , compatible with the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the theory is completed with equations that relate the deformation strains of the structure to the elastodynamic forces and torques . the simplest constitutive model to consider",
    "is based on kirchoff relations with shear deformation and viscoelasticity .",
    "such a cosserat model provides a well defined six dimensional quasi - linear hyperbolic system of ( integro-)partial differential equations in two independent variables .",
    "it may be applied to the study of gravitational wave interactions by suitably choosing external body forces @xmath7 to represent the tidal interaction with each element in the medium .",
    "a typical system might consist of at least two loops orbiting in interplanetary space .",
    "each structure would be composed of high q material , several km in length .",
    "such a structure , made up of transportable segments , could be conveyed to an orbiting station and constructed in space .",
    "the lowest quadrupole excitation of a steel circular structure would be about 1  hz and vary inversely as its ( stress - free ) length .",
    "actuator and feedback instrumentation could be placed around the antennae to `` tune '' the system to an optimal reference configuration .",
    "the precise details of the density and elastic moduli needed to enhance the sensitivity of the receiver would result from an in - depth analytic analysis of the cosserat equations for free motion .",
    "the ability to readily optimise the resonant behaviour for coupled axial , lateral and torsional vibrations by design is a major advantage over other mechanical antennae that have been proposed .",
    "by contrast a broad band detector could consist of an open ended structure coiled into a spiral .",
    "for planar spirals with traction free open ends the spectral density of normal transverse and axial linearised modes increases with the density of the spiral winding number .",
    "they form ideal broad band detectors with directional characteristics . furthermore by coupling such a spiral at its outer end to a light mass by a short length of high - q fibre ( such as sapphire ) one may tune such an extension to internal resonances , thereby amplifying the spiral elastic excitation .",
    "such excitations offer new detection mechanisms based on the enhanced motion of the outer structure of the spiral .    0.5 cm    * cosserat equations *    0.5 cm    u v    the dynamical evolution of awith mass density , @xmath8\\mapsto\\rho(s),$ ] and cross - sectional area , @xmath9\\mapsto a(s),$ ] is governed by newton s dynamical laws : @xmath10 @xmath11 applied to a triad of orthonormal vectors : @xmath8\\mapsto\\ { { \\boldsymbol d_1 } ( s , t),{\\boldsymbol d_2 } ( s , t),{\\boldsymbol d_3 } ( s , t)\\}$ ] over the space - curve : @xmath8\\mapsto\\r ( s , t)$ ] at time @xmath3 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote external force and torque densities respectively and @xmath9\\mapsto\\rho\\ii$ ] is a moment of inertia tensor . in these field equations the _ contact forces _ @xmath15 and _ contact torques _ @xmath16 are related to the vector @xmath17 and the _ strains _ @xmath18 by constitutive relations .",

    "post newtonian gravitational fields ( such as gravitomagnetic and lens - thirring effects ) can be accommodated with a more refined metric background .",
    "an important consideration of any modelling of cosserat continua to low levels of excitation is the estimation of signal to noise ratios induced by anelasticity and thermal interactions . to gain an insight into",

    "the above outlines a new approach to the modelling of gravitational interactions with slender structures in space .",
    "given the topology and material properties of an antenna one may analyse its response to such signals in terms of solutions to a deterministic system of well defined partial ( integro-)differential equations .",
    "these equations are in general easier to analyse than those describing the elastodynamics of three - dimensional materials .",
    "however in addition to controlling the temperature dependence of material characteristics , thermal interactions with such structures will induce a stochastic element into the signal response .",
    "it is therefore necessary to seek modifications to the above cosserat description that can accommodate such random interactions . in the presence of internal damping",
    "this is non - trivial problem for a broad band resonant detector .    in the calculation that follows",
    "we shall oversimplify this problem in order to gain some order of magnitude estimates of signal - to-(thermal)noise ratios for both narrow and broad band resonant detectors made of known high - q materials .",
    "the simplest approach is to approximate the cosserat equations by ignoring flexure and torsional mode excitations and explore the purely string - like excitations .",
    "commensurate with these approximations we shall assume that the damping can be described in terms of a single q - factor at about @xmath81 k for each resonant mode and that the thermal interactions give rise to a stochastic system driven by a spatially homogeneous gaussian noise term .",
    "we shall make two further restrictions by assuming that the antenna possesses sufficient stiffness to maintain planar motion in tension ( e.g. by overall slow rotation about its centre of mass ) throughout the excitation time and that the environment produces no overall translational drift away from a regular orbital motion of its centroid .",
    "the plane will be chosen orthogonal to the direction of propagation of a gravitational disturbance .",
    "we therefore begin by examining the linearised modes about an arbitrary planar 1-dimensional structure . in this way we can address the response of both a narrow band planar loop and a broad band planar spiral together . given the anelastic characteristics of the structure all of these restrictions can be readily relaxed at the cost of increased complexity in the thermo - mechanical analysis .",
