    "+    this map sends an @xmath0-th vertex to the intersection of 2 diagonals : @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the definition implies that this map is invariant under projective transformations .",
    "surprisingly , this simple map stands at the intersection of many branches of mathematics : dynamical systems , integrable systems , projective geometry , and cluster algebras . in this paper",
    "we focus on integrability of the pentagram map .",
    "its integrability was thoroughly studied in the paper  @xcite , where the authors considered the pentagram map on a more general space @xmath3 of the so - called twisted polygons ( or @xmath4-gons ) .",
    "a twisted polygon is a piecewise linear curve , which is not necessarily closed , but has a monodromy relating its vertices after @xmath4 steps ( we state its precise definition in the next section ) .",
    "they proved the arnold - liouville integrability for the pentagram map on this space :    [ ost - th ] there exists a poisson structure invariant under the pentagram map on the space @xmath3 of twisted @xmath4-gons .",
    "when @xmath4 is even , the poisson brackets have 4 independent casimirs , and @xmath5 invariant functions in involution .",
    "when @xmath4 is odd , there are only 2 casimirs , and @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 ) invariant functions in involution . here",
    "@xmath8 is the floor ( i.e. , the greatest integer ) function of @xmath9 .",
    "the total dimension of @xmath3 for all monodromies together is @xmath10 , and this theorem implies the arnold - liouville complete integrability on @xmath3 . in other words , a zariski open subset of @xmath3 is foliated into tori , and the time evolution is a quasiperiodic motion on these tori .",
    "the authors of  @xcite posed an open question about integrability for regular closed polygons .",
    "closed polygons form a submanifold @xmath11 of codimension @xmath12 in @xmath3 , but it is difficult to find out what happens with integrability on this submanifold .",
    "one of the main results of the present study is a solution of this problem in the complexified case ( see theorem  [ closed - poly ] below ) .",
    "note that r. schwartz conjectured that the pentagram map is a quasi - periodic motion in  @xcite , introduced the integrals of motion and proved their algebraic independence in  @xcite .",
    "the central component of the algebraic - geometric integrability is a lax representation with a spectral parameter , which is introduced for the pentagram map in theorem  [ lax - func ] .",
    "there are several advantages of this approach over the one taken in  @xcite :    * it works equally well both in the continuous and discrete cases .",
    "in particular , the same algebraic - geometric methods can be used to integrate the continuous limit of the pentagram map - the boussinesq equation . *",
    "it can be used almost without changes to prove integrability for closed polygons . *",
    "the lax representation provides a systematic way to obtain a hamiltonian structure on the space @xmath3 by the universal techniques of krichever and phong ( more precisely , these techniques allow one to find a natural presymplectic form , which becomes symplectic on certain submanifolds and has action - angle coordinates ) .",
    "our main results can be formulated in the following 4 theorems . later on we",
    "will introduce the notion of spectral data which consists of a riemann surface , called a spectral curve , and a point in the jacobian ( i.e. , the complex torus ) of this curve .",
    "[ spectral - th ] the space @xmath13 of twisted @xmath4-gons ( here @xmath14 ) has a zariski open subset which is in a bijection with a zariski open subset of the spectral data .",

    "the genus of @xmath19 is @xmath20 for even @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for odd @xmath23 .",
    "each torus ( jacobian @xmath24 ) is invariant with respect to the pentagram map .",
    "here and below `` generic '' means the values of the parameters from some zariski open subset of the set of all parameters ( e.g. , in this theorem `` generic parameters '' form a subspace of codimension @xmath25 in the space of dimension @xmath26 as follows from theorem  [ t : spec - curve ] ) .",
    "the bijection in the theorem is called the spectral map .",
    "note that we consider polygons on a complex projective plane instead of a real projective plane , which does not change any formulas for the pentagram map .",
    "next theorem together with the previous one establishes the algebraic - geometric integrability :    [ time - evol ] let @xmath27 \\in j(\\gamma)$ ] be the point that corresponds to a generic twisted polygon at time @xmath28 after applying the spectral map , and @xmath29 $ ] be the point describing the twisted polygon at an integer time @xmath30 .",

    "here for odd @xmath4 the discrete time evolution in @xmath24 goes along a straight line , whereas for even @xmath4 the evolution is staircase - like .",
    "the point @xmath32 corresponds to ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 is finite ) , and the points @xmath35 correspond to ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "note that the pentagram dynamics understood as a shift on complex tori does not prevent the corresponding orbits on the space @xmath13 from being unbounded .",
    "indeed , these complex tori are the jacobians of the corresponding smooth spectral curves , while the dynamics described above takes place for generic initial data , i.e. , for points on the jacobians whose orbits do not intersect special divisors ( see section 3.2 ) . a point of a generic orbit with an irrational shift can return arbitrarily close to such a divisor . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse spectral map is defined outside of these special divisors and may have poles there .",
    "therefore the sequence in the space @xmath13 corresponding to this orbit may escape to infinity .",
    "[ closed - poly ] for generic closed polygons the pentagram map is defined only for @xmath37 .",
    "closed polygons are singled out by the condition that @xmath38 is a triple point of @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is equivalent to 5 linear relations on @xmath39 : @xmath40 the genus of @xmath19 drops to @xmath41 when @xmath4 is even , and to @xmath42 when @xmath4 is odd .",
    "the dimension of the jacobian @xmath24 drops by @xmath43 for closed polygons .",

    "is fibred over the base of dimension @xmath45 .",
    "the coordinates on the base are @xmath46 subject to the constraints from theorem  [ closed - poly ] .",
    "the fibres are zariski open subsets of jacobians ( complex tori ) of dimension @xmath45 for odd @xmath4 , and of dimension @xmath47 for even @xmath4 .",
    "note that the restriction of the symplectic form ( which corresponds to the poisson brackets on the symplectic leaves ) to the space @xmath11 is always degenerate , therefore the arnold - liouville theorem is not directly applicable for closed polygons .",
    "nevertheless , the algebraic - geometric methods guarantee that the pentagram map exhibits quasi - periodic motion on a jacobian .",
    "( another way around this difficulty was suggested in  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the last theorem describes the relation of the krichever - phong s formula with the poisson structure of the pentagram map .",
    "krichever - phong s universal formula ( defined in  @xcite ) applied to the setting of the pentagram map provides a pre - symplectic 2-form on the space @xmath3 , see section  [ kpform - sec ] .",
    "[ kp - form ] krichever - phong s pre - symplectic 2-form turns out to be a symplectic form of rank @xmath48 after the restriction to the leaves : @xmath49 for odd @xmath4 , and @xmath50 for even @xmath4 .",
    "these leaves coincide with the symplectic leaves of the poisson structure found in  @xcite .",
    "the symplectic form is invariant under the pentagram map and coincides with the inverse of the poisson structure restricted to the symplectic leaves .",
