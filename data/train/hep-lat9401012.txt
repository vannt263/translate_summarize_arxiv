    "the study of four fermion interactions has a long history .",
    "fermi originally introduced the idea as a theory for weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "later nambu and jona - lasinio proposed their model  @xcite ( in the following called the njl model ) to describe spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation .",
    "this was one of the first works to note the association of a massless nambu - goldstone boson with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry  @xcite .    over the years",
    "there have been efforts to investigate the vacuum structure of strongly interacting four fermion theories  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in this subject in connection with technicolour and the top - mode standard model  @xcite . for these applications",
    "one is mainly interested in the physics of the broken phase where the fermion mass is dynamically generated .",
    "additional interest was generated by the discovery that a generalized njl model is equivalent to the higgs - yukawa model  @xcite and possibly to @xmath0 gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore there have been various investigations of the gauged njl model  @xcite which show a line of second order phase transitions linking the pure njl model and qed .",
    "this raises the question of whether the two models fall into the same universality class .",
    "our investigation of qed  @xcite has shown that in the strong coupling regime ( including the critical region ) it is impossible to vary the cutoff without changing the physics , while in the weakly coupled region this is possible .",
    "we have called such behaviour weak renormalisability .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in the model s phase transition and critical behaviour .",
    "since this falls into the large coupling region , nonperturbative methods are required .",
    "we use the lattice monte carlosimulation and the semi - analytic schwinger - dyson  method  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo  method has the advantage of being exact but can only be applied on finite lattice volumes .",
    "the schwinger - dyson  approach on the other hand can be extended to infinite volumes but suffers from having an uncontrolled approximation .",
    "the synergy of both methods allows us to go much further than with either method alone .",
    "we have looked at the chiral condensate in order to map out the phase diagram .",
    "we find a second order chiral phase transition implying infinite correlation length which in principle allows us to obtain a continuum theory . in the vicinity of the critical point",
    "we calculate the renormalised fermion mass ( @xmath1 ) and the energy levels of the pseudoscalar ( @xmath2 , goldstone boson ) , scalar ( @xmath3 ) and vector ( @xmath4 ) fermion - antifermion composite states as well as the pion decay constant ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a major problem is the identification of resonances and bound states on a finite lattice . for the @xmath2  and @xmath4  we were able to identify the first excited energy levels by our monte carlo  calculation .",
    "these compare favourably with the results from the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "thus we feel encouraged to take the thermodynamic limit of the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "this allows the calculation of the spectral functions and thus the identification of resonances . with this identification at hand",
    "we construct flow diagrams of dimensionless ratios of physical quantities .",
    "we use them to investigate the renormalisation group flow in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our lattice model is defined in section 2.1 .",
    "details of the monte carlo  method are given in sections 2.2 , 3.1 , 3.2 and 4.1 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations  are discussed in sections 2.3 , 3.2 , 3.3 , 4.2 , 4.3 and the appendices .",
    "our main results of both methods are given in section 5 on meson spectroscopy and in section 6 for the renormalisation group flows .",
    "finally in section 7 we present our conclusions .",
    "because we are interested in chiral symmetry properties we use staggered fermions throughout .",

    "in order to use the monte carlo  method we first have to integrate out the fermion fields . therefore we have to rewrite the interaction in a bilinear form .",
    "this is done by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath11",
    "@xcite : @xmath12.\\ ] ] the hybrid monte carlo method was employed to generate the configurations .",
    "lattices of size @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 were used .",
    "boundary conditions were periodic in the spatial directions and anti - periodic in the time direction .",
    "we investigated the model for @xmath18 to 0.09 and @xmath19 to 0.32 . for each parameter set 1000 trajectories were generated for measurements .",
    "the trajectory length was always @xmath20  0.8 .",
    "the number of time steps was adjusted such that acceptance rates between 70 and 80% were achieved .",
    "propagators were calculated with the conjugate gradient method . as convergence criterion we required that the norm of the rest vector was smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "the chiral condensate was calculated with a stochastic estimator ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) .      the model ( [ eq - s ] ) was also studied by solving truncated schwinger - dyson equationsup to order @xmath22 and @xmath23 on the lattice . to make a direct comparison with monte carlo  results possible we use the same action with",
    "the same cut - off ( for another application of schwinger - dyson equations  to a lattice theory see  @xcite ) .    in order to write the equations in this section in a compact form",
    "it is useful to give the lattice action ( [ eq - s ] ) with a slightly different notation : @xmath24 the fields at site @xmath25 are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the einstein summation convention is to be used whenever a site index occurs twice .",
    "the meaning of the kinetic matrices @xmath28 and of the coupling tensor @xmath29 should be clear by comparison with ( [ eq - s ] ) : @xmath30 if @xmath31 , @xmath32 if @xmath33 and zero otherwise ; @xmath34 if @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath25 and @xmath37 are neighbours , and is zero otherwise .",
    "it is convenient to give the coupling tensor four indices so that we can use the einstein summation convention and to remind us that more general four - fermi coupling terms are possible .",
    "the lattice feynman rules are that the bare staggered fermion propagator is @xmath38 and the vertex is @xmath39 when the interaction is turned on the bare fermion propagator is replaced by the full fermion propagator @xmath40 the new matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 are generalisations of the matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 appearing in ( [ freeprop ] ) and have the same symmetries , e.  g. , @xmath41 is symmetric under reflections and links sites with even separations in violation of chiral symmetry . on",
    "the other hand @xmath42 is odd in the @xmath45 direction and even in the other directions and only links sites with odd separations and so respects chiral symmetry .",

    "it is not possible to solve the full schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "they have to be truncated at some stage .",
    "the crudest approximation is to keep only term ( a ) which gives the gap equation , namely @xmath49 where @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 the @xmath52-sum runs over all momenta consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath1 is given by the position of the pole and is @xmath53 .",
    "the next approximation is to keep terms ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "term ( a ) leads simply to a renormalisation of the mass and term ( b ) leads to a renormalisation of the kinetic energy .",
    "we shall call these the order @xmath22 schwinger - dyson equations  because the error is of order @xmath23 .",
    "explicitly they read @xmath54 where @xmath50 and @xmath55 satisfy @xmath56 the pole position giving the fermion mass is @xmath57 in infinite volumes ( when the sum is replaced by an integral ) @xmath55 needs no direction index , as all the @xmath58 s are identical . however in a finite system with different lattice lengths and boundary conditions in the space and time directions an index is needed .",
    "the order @xmath23 equations also include term ( c ) , but with the full vertex replaced by the bare vertex , an approximation which introduces an error of @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting equations ( given in configuration space ) are @xmath60 @xmath46 and @xmath61 can be projected out by using their different behaviours under reflection . for the first time",
    "the unknown matrices @xmath46 and @xmath61 are not simply renormalised versions of the bare matrices , but extend further in space .",
    "mass and wave - function normalisation become momentum dependent .",
    "the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath62 are stored in position space .",
    "these individual components can be thought of as the fourier coefficients for the momentum space fermion propagator .",
    "the equations were solved numerically by simple iterations . typically about 7 iterations were needed in the order @xmath22 case to obtain convergence and 2040 iterations in the order @xmath23 case .",
    "to find the phase diagram we have computed the chiral condensate @xmath63 also referred to as @xmath3 .",
