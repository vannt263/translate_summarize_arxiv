    "hardy , _ collected papers _ , 7 vols .",
    "( clarendon press , oxford , 1966 - 1979 ) .    according to mactutor s article on hardy : `` ... hilbert was so concerned that hardy was not being properly treated ( while living at cambrige ) that he wrote to the master of the college pointing out that _ the best mathematician in england _ should have the best rooms . ''",
    "harald bohr , who stood in close contact with hardy , assessing the leadership of hardy and littlewood in english research ( 1947 ) , wrote `` i may report what an excellent colleague once jokingly said : ' ' nowadays , there are only three really great english mathematicians : hardy , littlewood , and hardy  littlewood .",
    "the following quotations give an interesting view of hardy s thoughts : `` i am obliged to interpolate some remarks on a very difficult subject : proof and its importance in mathematics .",
    "all physicists , and a good many quite reputable mathematicians , are contemptuous about proof .",
    "i heard professor eddington , for example , mention that proof , as pure mathematicians understand it , is really quite uninteresting and unimportant , and that no one who is really certain that he has found something good should waste his time looking for proof . '' while reviewing the question of the reality of nature from a mathematical viewpoint , g.h .",
    "hardy stated : `` ... i will state my own position dogmatically in order to avoid minor misapprehensions .",
    "i believe that mathematical reality lies outside us , that our function is to discover or observe it , and that theorems which we prove , and which we describe grandiloquently as our ' ' creations `` are simply our notes of our observations .",
    "this view has been held in some form or another , from plato onwards ... ''    according to the appraisal of the trinity college chapel , hardy `` was universally recognized as pre - eminent among the world s best mathematicians '' ; `` as his most important influence hardy cited the self - study of _ cours danalyse de lecole polytechnique _ by the french mathematician camille jordan ... hardy is credited with reforming british mathematics by bringing rigour into it , which was previously a characteristic of french , swiss and german mathematics .",
    "british mathematics had remained largely in the tradition of applied mathematics , in thrall to the reputation of isaac newton ( see cambridge mathematical tripos ) .",
    "hardy was more in tune with the _ cours danalyse _ methods dominant in france , and aggressively promoted his conception of pure mathematics , in particular against the hydrodynamics which was an important part of cambridge mathematics . ''",
    "more significant than hardy s collaboration with littlewood was that with srinivasa aiyangar ramanujan , born 1887 at erode , madras presidency ( of a tamil brahmin family ) , a self  taught and obsessive shipping clerk from madras ( see @xcite ) . in 1913 he sent a nine  page paper to hardy , dealing with two remarkable , novel infinite series of hypergeometric type ( related to research of euler and gauss ) , and continued fractions .",
    "hardy was so amazed that he commented to littlewood that ramanujan was `` a mathematician of highest quality , a man of altogether exceptional originality and power '' .",
    "hardy brought him to cambridge ( the well ",

    "baker and e.w .",

    "they became friends , collaborated ( called `` the one romantic incident in my life '' by hardy ) and wrote five remarkable papers together .",
    "ramanujan made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis , number theory , continued fractions and infinite series , rediscovered known theorems of bernoulli , euler , gauss and riemann .",
    "he conjectured or proved nearly 3900 theorems , identities and equations .",
    "hardy regarded the `` discovery of ramanujan '' as `` his greatest contribution to mathematics '' , and assailed ramanujan s natural geniuity , being on the same league as euler and gauss .",
    "in his book _",
    "ramanujan s twelve lectures on subjects suggested by his life and work _",
    "( cambridge , 1940 ) , hardy placed an everlasting monument for ramanujan who had died too young .",

    "surprisingly , no university in the england or scotland picked it . at a special dinner at chelsea college at the beginning of the tour , in the presence of about a dozen of london s major analysts ,",
