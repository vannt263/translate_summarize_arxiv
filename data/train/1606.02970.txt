    "the scalar state @xmath0 , also with @xmath7 and known as @xmath8 , still needs confirmation .",
    "the acceptance of the lightest @xmath8 in the summary table of the pdg is important since it would allow to complete the nonet of the light scalar states below @xmath9 gev.the main aim of this work is to understand the nature of the two resonances @xmath1 and @xmath0 using the quantum field theoretical model described in ref .",

    "next , we calculate the coordinates of the poles on the complex plane . despite the fact that we included only one seed  state in the effective lagrangian , we find two poles : one corresponding to the peak in the spectral function at @xmath2 gev and thus to @xmath1 , and one corresponding to the light @xmath8 .",
    "we get additional information about the nature of both resonances by studying the changes of the spectral function and the movement of the poles for increasing @xmath6 : @xmath1 behaves as a @xmath13 state , while the light @xmath8 is a dynamically generated state and as such a non - ordinary meson ( see e.g. refs .",
