    ".    mechanisms of coexistence have been a central theoretical question because complexity of a population state ( i.e. coexistence ) and stability are often contradicting requirements @xcite .",
    "coexistence in population dynamics has been explained by , for example , nonequilibrium - state interpretation , habitat subdivision , heterogeneity in species such as heterogeneous dispersal speeds , and heterogeneity in environments @xcite .",
    "spatial structure such as the square lattice also limits diffusion and promotes coexistence . in this case , each species is clustered in different regions of the lattice @xcite .",
    "however , real - world interaction quite often occurs on contact networks of individuals that are more complex than the square lattice .",
    "most real networks have the small - world and scale - free properties ( e.g. refs .",
    "the small - world property is equivalent to the combination of small average distance between vertices and large clustering , or abundance of densely connected small subgraphs such as triangles .",
    "a scale - free network is defined by a degree distribution , or the distribution of the number of contacts ( edges ) that each vertex has , which follows a power law , @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the probability that a vertex has degree @xmath2",
    ". the scale - free property may be too idealistic to describe contact networks underlying real population dynamics .",
    "even so , it seems likely that different patches or individuals are endowed with different connectivity to others .    in terms of networks ,",
    "some known mechanisms of coexistence benefit from the regular lattices , the one - dimensional continuous line , the two - dimensional continuous plane , and the complete graph ( mean field situation ) , in which all the vertices are considered to share the same degree ( see the papers cited above and references therein ) . in random graphs , which are sometimes used in this context @xcite , the vertex degree obeys the poisson distribution",
    ". however , the real degree distribution may be even broader .",
    "here we investigate how possibility of coexistence is affected by heterogeneous degree distributions of contact networks , not by heterogeneous environments other than network - based ones or heterogeneous individuals . among various competitive relationships among different phenotypes , we focus on cyclic competition of three species , which is a minimal case .",
    "cyclic competition is actually abundant in nature .",
    "for example , tropical marine ecosystems @xcite and vertebrate communities in high - arctic areas @xcite include cyclic dominance relations composed of a couple of organisms ( also see ref .",
    "real microbial communities of _ escherichia coli _ @xcite and color polymorphisms of natural lizards @xcite also have cyclically dominating three phenotypes and show alternating wax - and - wane population densities . in evolutionary games , the public - good game with volunteering , namely , the choice of not joining the game , results in cyclic competition @xcite .",
    "the susceptible - infected - recovered - susceptible model of epidemiology and models with additional types of states also include cyclic competition @xcite .",
    "we focus on two specific predator - prey models of such cyclic interaction , that is , the standard rock - scissors - paper ( rsp ) model @xcite and the may - leonard ( ml ) model @xcite .",
    "these models have neutrally stable or unstable coexistence solutions in well - mixed populations .",
    "therefore , in a finite population , population dynamics are eventually trapped by an absorbing state corresponding to the dominance of one species @xcite .",
    "we show that heterogeneous degree distributions stabilize coexistence of multiple types of individuals placed on networks .",
    "as a minimal model of cyclic competition , we consider the standard rsp dynamics on networks with heterogeneous contact rates .",
    "there are three species , which we call states , represented by rock , scissors , and paper ; rock beats scissors , scissors beat paper , and paper beats rock .",
    "each vertex takes state 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "a pair of vertices may be connected by an edge .",
    "the degree @xmath2 of a vertex is the number of edges , or the number of contacts with other vertices .",
    "state 1 outcompetes state 0 by invading onto each neighboring state with state 0 at a rate of @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , a vertex with state 0 changes its state to 1 at a rate of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of vertices with state @xmath6 in the neighborhood .",
    "similarly , 1 ( 2 ) turns into 2 ( 0 ) at a rate of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . in an ecological context",
    ", we are considering the limit that dispersion rates ( @xmath9 1 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 ) are much larger than the natural death rate .",
    "we consider the influence of death rates later with the ml model .    for a perfectly mixed population",
    ", the mean field theory tells that there are an ensemble of neutrally stable limit cycles surrounding a neutrally stable equilibrium corresponding to coexistence of the three states .",
    "therefore , the coexistence solution is practically unstable in finite populations .",
    "the rsp dynamics with spatial structure , such as the square lattice , accommodate many states each of which is clustered in different loci @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in a network mechanism that may enable stable coexistence",
    ".      with dispersed degrees , vertices with different degrees obey different state - transition dynamics .",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 the probability that a vertex with degree @xmath2 takes state @xmath6 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the probability that a vertex adjacent to an arbitrary vertex takes state @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "this probability does not generally agree with @xmath11 or its average over all the vertices .",

    ", it suffices to consider the density of state 1 and that of state 2 . noting that the expected number of state-@xmath6 neighbors of a vertex with degree @xmath2 is equal to @xmath19 , we derive @xmath20 for example , the first term in eq .",

    "larger fluctuation means more unstable coexistence , and we examine how the size of the fluctuation depends on the amount of degree dispersion .",
    "in addition to the networks examined above , we use two types of networks that can create a range of degree dispersion .",

    "regardless of the network type , more dispersed degree distributions generally lead to more stable coexistence .    in the mean field case ,",
    "a smaller network with a stronger finite - size effect tends to drive the population dynamics to the absorbing equilibrium where only one state survives @xcite . the network effect on stability of coexistence is more manifested in this regime . in fig .",

    "practically , one species eventually wins due to the finite - size effect .    as an interacting particle system ,",

    "similar to the rsp dynamics , the amount of degree dispersion is strongly correlated with the amount of density fluctuation and stability of coexistence , irrespective of the network type [ fig .  [",
    "fig : may](c ) ] .",
    "we have examined population dynamics with cyclic dominance relationships on networks .",
    "the steady population density is independent of degree distributions of networks .",
    "however , stability of coexistence equilibria and dynamics depend considerably on networks .",
    "heterogeneity in degree distributions facilitates stable coexistence of different phenotypes . as touched upon in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , coexistence of competing species is desirable in , for example , ecological communities ( biodiversity ) and evolutionary games ( survival of altruistic players ) .      the present mechanism of coexistence is related to synchronization of coupled oscillators . with spread degree distributions ,",
    "each @xmath11 evolves at a speed proportional to @xmath2 , and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 are coupled by a sort of mean field feedback @xmath13 .",
    "then , the population dynamics are analogous to those of an ensemble of phase oscillators coupled by mean field interaction . in theory , coupled phase oscillators become desynchronized when the intrinsic frequency of the oscillators has a broad distribution relative to the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "oscillators with heterogeneous intrinsic frequencies correspond to vertices with heterogeneous @xmath2 . in terms of competition dynamics on networks",
    ", asynchrony corresponds to stable coexistence of species where synchronous oscillations ( large fluctuations in time ) of the population density is suppressed .",
    "desynchronization is known to suppress neutrally stable or unstable oscillations in ecological models with patchy populations , heterogeneous birth rates , and weak aggregation @xcite .",
    "heterogeneity in degree distributions serves to stable coexistence via desynchronization even without other kinds of heterogeneity .",
    "the correspondence between asynchrony and coexistence may be exported to more general models , particularly to ones showing oscillations in well - mixed populations ; oscillatory population densities are reminiscent of cyclic competition .",
    "the scenario to coexistence unraveled here is distinct from those based on spatial structure , heterogeneous environments , or heterogeneous individuals . in patchy habitats with heterogeneous environments or small diffusion @xcite , and in spatial structure with limited diffusion @xcite",
    ", multiple species can coexist by forming locally high densities of conspecifics in different subspaces @xcite .",
    "this is the spatial mechanism of coexistence . in networks with dispersed degrees ,",
    "multiple species can coexist on a network in a mixed manner without spatial segregation .",
    "real networks of contacts are equipped with the clustering property , as is the case for the regular lattices and small - world networks , and high clustering elicits the spatial mechanism of coexistence .",
    "in addition , many networks own broad degree distributions represented by the scale - free distributions @xcite .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this work can cooperate with the spatial mechanism to promote stability of coexistence .",
    "there are many possible rules for interacting particle systems . in contagion processes , such as the percolation , the susceptible - infected - recovered model , and the contact process ( susceptible - infected - susceptible model )",
    ", degree dispersion affects dynamical aspects by , for example , accelerating disease propagation in initial stages @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , however , epidemic thresholds ( critical infection rates ) are proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "then , disease propagation on a global scale is more likely to occur on networks with more heterogeneous contact rates with small @xmath103 than on networks with rather homogeneous degrees such as the regular lattices and the random graph @xcite . in contagion dynamics",
    ", the network influences the stationary state in addition to the dynamics , which contrasts to our results for the competition dynamics .    generally speaking ,",
    "the positions of equilibria move when we can not neglect at least one type of state - transition event whose occurrence rate is independent of neighbors states @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "examples are spontaneous recovery and mutation . by contrast , the equilibria are invariant if all the state transitions are controlled by the neighbors states , as is the case for the rsp model , the ml model , and also the voter model .",
    "however , the degree distribution does influence the stability of coexistence and hence the whole population dynamics .",
    "our results are generalized to other population dynamics in which the rates of spontaneous transitions can be ignored .",
