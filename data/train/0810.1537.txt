    "noise induced phenomena in nonlinear systems have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of contexts in physics , chemistry and the life sciences .",
    "an important example is the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite , in which the response of the system ( output ) to external driving ( input ) is amplified and optimized for certain values of the noise parameters .",
    "more specifically , the non - monotonic behavior of the output signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) with the strength of the noise is a widely accepted signature of sr .",
    "in addition , a dimensionless quantity known as the sr gain is usually defined as the ratio of the output snr over the input snr .",
    "very recently , very large sr gains have been reported for systems formed by a finite number @xmath0 of globally coupled bistable oscillators @xcite . here",
    "the term _ global coupling _ is used to indicate that each oscillator interacts with _ all _ other oscillators .",
    "these systems were used years ago by kometani and shimizu @xcite as an empirical model to describe muscle contraction .",
    "later on , desai and zwanzig @xcite gave a more detailed statistical mechanical description , finding an order - disorder transition for a variable defined as the expectation value of the position of one oscillator .",
    "this variable is used to study the global behavior of the coupled bistable system .",
    "desai and zwanzig focused on systems with infinitely large sizes , @xmath1 , investigating the system dynamics by analyzing the time evolution of the central cumulant moments of one - oscillator s distribution .",
    "in addition , a gaussian approximation was proposed in order to close the cumulant moment hierarchy and obtain analytical expressions .",
    "a similar approach is currently used as a mean field approximation in the investigation of various noise - induced phenomena such as noise - induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to study the effect of fluctuations due to the finite size of the system , pikovsky et al .",
    "@xcite extended this approach by replacing the expectation values of one - oscillator properties @xmath2 by arithmetic means over all oscillators @xmath3 .",
    "a gaussian approximation , including noisy terms , was derived and used to illustrate the phenomenon of system size resonance , in which the sr quantifiers display a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath0 . in this paper , the work by pikovsky et al .",
    "is extended to higher orders in the fluctuating cumulant dynamics .",
    "the gaussian approximation is re - derived using a rigorous formalism based on it stochastic calculus and compared with other approximations .",
    "one important goal of this paper is to explain the very large gain values observed in globally coupled bistable systems @xcite , especially when compared with those observed in uncoupled or isolated bistable systems . to that effect , it is desirable to derive a simplified theory in which the number of degrees of freedom is much smaller than the number of coupled oscillators , thus being more amenable to analytical treatment or qualitative interpretation . in this regard ,",
    "the gaussian approximation is a practical alternative , though in principle not fully satisfactory , because it is not based on a small parameter expansion but on an uncontrolled assumption ( the neglect of cumulants higher than the second ) that is known to be not accurate even in the limit of an infinite system @xcite .    in this paper , this approximation is presented , as well as other simplified models with a reduced number of degrees of freedom which are able to mimic the most important features of the system dynamics with a finite size .",
    "these simplified models represent different approximation schemes and might be regarded as an expansion or generalization of the work by desai and zwanzig @xcite and pikovsky et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the model system and the sr quantifiers",
    "are defined .",
    "the simplified models are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff ] .",
    "these models are compared to the original model system by means of computer simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] provides a short summary and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath0 interacting bistable oscillators , each one of them characterized by a single degree of freedom @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , whose dynamics is governed by the langevin equations @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a gaussian white noise with zero average and @xmath8 @xmath9 is a coupling parameter defining the strength of the interaction between oscillators , and @xmath10 is an external driving force of period @xmath11 .    to characterize the system as a whole we define the _ collective _ or _ global _ variable @xmath12 as @xmath13",
    "the stochastic resonance quantifiers for this variable are defined in the usual way .",
    "the one - time correlation function , @xmath14 can be written as the sum of two contributions : a coherent part , @xmath15 which is periodic with period @xmath11 , and an incoherent part @xmath16 which decays to zero for large values of @xmath17 and reflects the correlation of the process @xmath12 at different times due to fluctuations . in the expressions",
    "above , the notation @xmath18 indicates an average over the noise realizations and the subscript `` @xmath19 '' indicates the long time limit of the noise average , i.  e. , its value after waiting for @xmath20 long enough that transients have died out .",
    "the snr of a random signal measures the signal strength relative to its background noise .",
    "more specifically , we calculate the output snr as @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 being the driving frequency , and @xmath24 note that the quantity @xmath25 is proportional to the so - called spectral amplification , which is another widely used sr quantifier .    as the size of the system @xmath0 is increased while keeping the interaction parameter @xmath9 constant , the collective variable @xmath12 becomes less noisy , becoming completely deterministic in the limit @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", @xmath26 diverges in that limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the averaging process implicit in the definition ( [ eq : def : s ] ) .",
    "the sr gain is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the snr of the collective input signal @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "for example , for a periodic rectangular driving force of amplitude @xmath30 , the input snr is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the sr gain ( [ eq : gaindef ] ) is a dimensionless quantity that measures the amplification of the system response with respect to the collective input signal .",
    "the input snr @xmath28 diverges linearly with @xmath0 in the limit @xmath1 , so that the sr gain remains finite .",
    "since in a system with coupled linear oscillators the snr of the collective process equals the snr of the collective input signal , i.e. @xmath32 , the sr gain also measures the response of the non - linear system with respect to that of a linear system subject to the same deterministic and stochastic forces .",
    "additionally , in the absence of interaction between the bistable oscillators ( the case @xmath33 ) , the collective sr gain @xmath34 equals the sr gain of each independent oscillator @xcite .",
    "thus , by comparing the sr gain values of the collective variable of a finite set of interacting oscillators with those observed in the case @xmath35 , we have a useful tool to highlight nonlinear effects that are a direct consequence of the coupling between the oscillators .",
    "in this section , we define a set of stochastic processes , which we will refer to as _ fluctuating cumulants _ , in order to describe the dynamics of a finite system of coupled oscillators in terms of a reduced number of variables .",
    "then , by using it stochastic calculus , we derive the hierarchy of equations that these cumulants obey .",
    "a few approximation schemes are proposed for systems with a large but finite number of oscillators .",
    "finally , we introduce a simple one - variable model in which the dynamics of @xmath12 is mimicked by using an effective potential .",
    "the fact that the infinite system ( @xmath36 ) is completely deterministic , and the approximations described in this section are valid for large @xmath0 , makes these methods especially appropriate to study the effect of fluctuations due to the finite size of the system .",
    "let us define the set of stochastic variables @xmath37^k,\\ ] ] with @xmath38 being a positive integer .",
    "we will refer to @xmath39 as the _ fluctuating moment _ of order @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath40 .    in order to obtain a hierarchy of stochastic differential equations for these variables , we need first to choose a convenient stochastic interpretation . the langevin equations ( [ eq : lang ] ) are well defined and do not depend on the stochastic interpretation . note , however ,",
    "that the specific form of the stochastic differential equations for the fluctuating moments do depend on the stochastic calculus utilized . in the following , unless explicitly stated , it stochastic calculus is assumed .",
    "it is customary within this calculus to use a notation to express the stochastic differential equations in which there is no explicit mention to the white noises ( see for example @xcite ) . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) would be written as @xmath41dt+(2d)^{1/2}{{\\mathrm d}}b_i , \\label{eq : lang : ito}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , is the differential of the wiener process @xmath44 with properties @xmath45 the gaussian white noise @xmath7 can be viewed as proportional to the derivative of @xmath44 , @xmath46 , though it is not an ordinary stochastic process but a generalized process and requires a special formalism to be defined rigorously ( see @xcite and references within ) . here",
    "we will use both notations at convenience .    using it differentiation rules",
    "@xcite we find the following stochastic differential equations for the fluctuating moments @xmath47 where @xmath48^k\\xi_i(t ) \\label{eq : muk : def}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 are @xmath50correlated noises with the following first moments @xmath51 notice that the result ( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) is only obtained from ( [ eq : muk : def ] ) when it calculus is assumed ( see appendix [ sec : apen1 ] ) .",
    "using stratonovich calculus leads to a much more intricate expression in which the approach proposed in this paper is not applicable .",
    "additionally , note that ( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) implies that the processes @xmath52 are not uncorrelated .",
    "rigorously , only @xmath53 is a gaussian process .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that in the asymptotic limit of a very large number of oscillators , @xmath1 , all @xmath52 tend towards a gaussian behavior ( see appendix [ sec : apen2 ] ) .",
    "this property will allow us to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : hier : mk ] ) as a closed set of stochastic equations for the fluctuating variables in that limit .",
    "we can define a set of fluctuating cumulants by using the formula : @xmath54 equation ( [ eq : mom : cum ] ) is the formula that relates the moments with the cumulant moments of a single - variable stochastic distribution . when the stochastic variable is gaussian , all cumulants @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , exactly vanish .",
    "a description in terms of cumulants is preferable because , unlike a descriptions with moments , it is expected that higher order cumulants are negligible in comparison with lower order cumulants , especially if the deviation with respect a gaussian behavior is not very large . in terms of the fluctuating cumulants @xmath55 , the first three equations of the hierarchy ( [ eq : hier : mk ] ) are @xmath57    the noise terms @xmath58 and @xmath52 vanish in the formal limit @xmath1 , therefore leading to a deterministic hierarchy of equations for the fluctuating moments or cumulants .",
    "this deterministic hierarchy is equivalent to the non - linear hierarchy obtained by desai and zwanzig in @xcite for the cumulant moments of the process @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast to the theory presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the calculation of one - time expectation values , the fluctuating cumulant approach will allow us to study dynamical properties such as autocorrelation functions .    when @xmath0 is finite ,",
    "the hierarchy of equations that @xmath39 or @xmath60 obeys is not closed , since the noise processes @xmath52 depend on @xmath39 in a non - trivial way . in the next subsections we present a few approximative schemes that overcome this difficulty for systems with a large number of coupled oscillators .",
    "if we retain the first two equations of ( [ eq : hie : cum:1])-([eq : hie : cum:3 ] ) , neglect all fluctuating cumulants @xmath55 with @xmath61 , and also neglect the term @xmath62 and the noise @xmath63 in ( [ eq : hie : cum:2 ] ) , we obtain a closed set of equations for the processes @xmath12 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 these set of equations was proposed by pikovsky et al .  in ref .",
    "this truncation scheme has been called `` the gaussian approximation '' because all fluctuating cumulants with order higher than the second one are neglected .",
    "there is no reason to expect a priori that these higher order cumulants can be neglected in any limit , other than the hope that their contribution is small .",
    "note , in addition , that in this scheme the @xmath66correlated noise @xmath63 is neglected without justification .",
    "let us now focus in a third order truncation scheme .",
    "we will retain the three eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hie : cum:1])-([eq : hie : cum:3 ] ) , but consistently neglect @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "since each @xmath69 for @xmath70 is a gaussian process in the lowest order in @xmath71 ( see appendix [ sec : apen2 ] ) , its probability distribution is completely determined by its first moments ( [ eq : muk:0])([eq : mukmukp ] ) .",
    "as mentioned before , the processes @xmath69 are not independent of each other .",
    "thus , it is preferable to express them in terms of a set of independent gaussian noises @xmath72 with zero mean and @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . with the expansion @xmath76 we only need to select the coefficients @xmath77 so that the correlations ( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) are satisfied .",
    "this can be achieved by using the gram - schmidt ortho - normalization method .",
    "the result for the first two terms is @xmath78 note , however , that in these expressions the coefficients @xmath77 appear as functions of the average values of the fluctuating cumulants @xmath55 .",
    "thus , if we plan to solve the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hie : cum:1])([eq : hie : cum:3 ] ) using ( [ eq : mu1])([eq : mu2 ] ) , we would have to consider the equation of motion for @xmath79 @xcite and solve the whole set of equations self - consistently .",
    "alternatively , we could use a slightly different version of ( [ eq : mu1])([eq : mu2 ] ) in which the expected values @xmath79 are replaced by @xmath55 .",
    "this way , the correlations ( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) for the first noise terms are also identically satisfied , and the fact that the fluctuating cumulants become deterministic in the limit @xmath1 guarantees that the proposed expressions for the noises @xmath69 are gaussian in the lowest order in @xmath71 .",
    "since all gaussian processes are completely determined by its first two moments , both methods to generate the noise sources @xmath52 are mathematically equivalent in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0 , though the later is more physically appealing because in this case the instantaneous value of the noise source @xmath69 in one trajectory does not depend on averages over trajectories but on single - trajectory values .",
    "using this later procedure , the following stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise are obtained @xmath80 this method has also the advantage that the system of equations ( [ eq : third ] ) can be solved numerically using standard stochastic algorithms @xcite .",
    "it represents a third order approximation scheme .",
    "notice that this scheme can be applied in a straightforward way to obtain the corresponding equations of an arbitrary order truncation of the fluctuating cumulant hierarchy .",
    "as we increase the truncation order of the fluctuating cumulant hierarchy , as we have discussed above , a more accurate approximation is obtained .",
    "however , the number of equations is also increased . on the other hand",
    ", we may wonder how good a description based on a single differential equation is .",
    "the aim is to derive a simplified model that may not mimic quantitatively but qualitatively the coupled system dynamics , in addition to being more amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "here we consider the following single stochastic equation @xmath81 where @xmath53 is the gaussian white noise defined by ( [ eq : muk:0])([eq : etaeta ] ) , and @xmath82 an effective potential to be specified .",

    "a strong amplification of the collective response is observed , with sr gains reaching very large values , especially when compared with uncoupled systems subject to the same input signals ( see ref .",
    "these findings were first reported in @xcite . since the numerator @xmath25 of the snr remains of the same order of magnitude for the range of noise strength values plotted , the large values of the sr gain are mainly due to the reduction of a few orders of magnitude of the denominator @xmath107 , as shown in the top - right panel of fig .",

    "the fact that this approach underestimates the fluctuations of the collective variable is easy to understand if one takes into account that the effective potential is a mean - field - like idealization in which the real discrete , more noisy , interaction is replaced by a smoothed potential .",

[ fig : n10 ] and [ fig : n30 ] .",
    "these gain values are much larger than those observed in uncoupled or isolated bistable systems subject to the same rectangular input signals @xcite , and thus are due to the interaction between the oscillators . for the sake of simplicity",

    "( [ eq : eff ] ) becomes deterministic and we can apply the concept of static threshold for a finite value of @xmath90 .",
    "a simple analysis of the infinite size potential shows that a constant driving of @xmath104 is able to remove one of the two attractors of the dynamics for systems with noise strength values @xmath90 larger than @xmath118 ( and , of course , smaller than @xmath119 , the noise value where the effective potential turns monostable in the absence of driving ) . therefore , most of the data points in figs .",
    "[ fig : n10 ] and [ fig : n30 ] correspond to _ suprathreshold _ dynamics when viewed from the perspective of the langevin equation ( [ eq : eff ] ) .",
    "the response is expected to be more amplified with suprathreshold signals than with subthreshold signals , because , for the first ones , the presence of noise is not necessary in order to produce jumps between the two locations of the time - dependent attractor .",

    "this is due to the fact that the strength of the fluctuations is very small even for small values of the system size @xmath0 , already below the optimal noise value in which the response is maximized .",
    "any further increase of the system size reduces the fluctuations and , thus , the jumps between the attractors .",
    "starting from the langevin equations defining the model system , we have derived , using it stochastic calculus , a hierarchy of exact stochastic differential equations for a set of fluctuating cumulant variables , defined by using the arithmetic mean over all oscillators . due to the useful mathematical properties of it stochastic calculus , the hierarchy contains noise terms with simple autocorrelation properties .",
    "furthermore , the approach proposed in this paper for the fluctuating cumulants is not directly applicable with stratonovich calculus . in the limit of an infinite number of oscillators , the whole hierarchy reduces to the one obtained by desai and zwanzig @xcite for the expected values of the cumulants .",
    "in contrast to the theory presented in ref.@xcite , the fluctuating cumulant approach allows us to study a wide kind of collective dynamical properties like autocorrelation functions or the snr , in addition to effects due to finite size fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , the noise terms that appear in the exact hierarchy for the fluctuating cumulant variables depend in a complicated way on the fluctuating cumulants and approximations have to be taken in order to obtain a closed set of stochastic differential equations . here",
    "it is shown that this difficulty can be overcome in the asymptotic limit of a very large number of oscillators . however , one still has the inconvenience of dealing with a hierarchy with an infinite number of equations , and a truncation scheme is desirable .",
    "a gaussian approximation was proposed by pikovsky et al .  in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here it is presented as a second - order truncation scheme of the fluctuating cumulant hierarchy .",
    "in addition , an arbritrary - order truncation method is proposed , with explicit expressions given for the third order only .",
    "this third order approach turns out to provide the best quantitative agreement with the sr data .",
    "finally , a rather simple approach based on a single variable and the use of an effective potential is proposed .",
    "the spectral amplification of the collective variable as a function of the noise strength @xmath90 of systems with @xmath99 and @xmath115 bistable oscillators is found to be in good agreement with the predictions given by all the approximations , though small but appreciable systematic deviations are observed for the gaussian approximation for a system with @xmath115 oscillators . additionally , the effective potential theory and the gaussian approximation do not account well for the snr or the sr gain of the collective variable , though the data is within the same order of magnitude",
    ". a systematic underestimation of the fluctuations of the collective variable is done by the effective potential approach due to the mean - field like character of this simplified theory .",
    "the best quantitative agreement of the snr and the sr gain is given by the third - order fluctuating cumulant theory , although a small systematic underestimation of the fluctuations is still observed with this third order theory due to the neglect of higher order fluctuating cumulants .",
    "furthermore , using any of the approximations presented , we are able to explain the very large gain values observed in refs .",
    "specifically , it is shown that the driving amplitudes used are suprathreshold from the point of view of the effective dynamics in the range of noise strength values utilized in those works , i.e. , there is only one attractor of the dynamics under the presence of the driving force , and this attractor oscillates following the driving force .",
    "simulation results , showing several sr quantifiers as a function of the system size @xmath0 , confirm this behavior .",
    "this situation resembles the effect of a high - frequency signal in an isolated bistable system . in the later case",
    ", the high - frequency signal can be removed from the description by means of an effective bistable potential with modified parameters , with the consequence that previously subthreshold driving amplitudes can become suprathreshold from the point of view of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the effective dynamics induced by the high - frequency signal has been shown to provoke the opposite effect on an excitable system , being able to suppress the excitable character of the system @xcite .",
    "this suggests that much work is needed in order to extend the present analysis to finite sets of coupled excitable systems @xcite .",
    "this research was supported by the direccin general de enseanza superior of spain ( grant no . fis2005 - 02884 ) , the junta de andaluca , and the juan de la cierva program of the ministerio de ciencia y tecnologa .",
    "the author thanks jess casado - pascual for helpful discussions .",
    "in the notation commonly utilized within the framework of it calculus , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) can be expressed as @xmath125 where @xmath126 . to prove these equations we start from the definition ( [ eq : muk : def ] ) to arrive at @xmath127^k{{\\mathrm d}}b_i(t),\\ ] ]",

    "similarly , using the fact that the wiener processes @xmath44 have independent increments , i.e. @xmath130 for @xmath131 , and that the increments @xmath132 are independent of @xmath133 at times @xmath134 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : apen1:gammak ] ) is readily proven .    in order to clarify the advantages of it calculus in the context of this paper ,",
    "let us now compute the autocorrelation of @xmath69 by using stratonovich calculus . in this case",
    "we are entitled to utilize the usual rules of differentiation of deterministic calculus .",

    "( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) plus the following two extra terms on the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mukmukp ] ) @xmath143 these extra terms make the problem much more difficult to deal with .",
    "in this appendix we show that the process @xmath69 tends to a gaussian behavior as @xmath1 . first note that the third moment of @xmath69 , @xmath144 and all odd moments of @xmath69 vanish .",
    "if @xmath69 were gaussian , all cumulants higher than the second should be zero .",
    "this requires all odd moments of @xmath69 to vanish but also a specific functional form of the even moments @xcite .",
    "for instance , were @xmath69 a gaussian process , the fourth moment @xmath145 would be given by @xmath146 instead , a simple calculation shows that for a finite @xmath0 the fourth moment is @xmath147 .",

    "( [ eq : m2gauss ] ) will hold as a good approximation , showing a gaussian behavior in the lowest order of a @xmath71 expansion .",
