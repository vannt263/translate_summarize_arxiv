    "the goal of ` phoenix `  is to be both as general as possible so that essentially all astrophysical objects can be modeled with a single code , and to make as few approximations as possible .",
    "approximations are inevitable ( particularly in atomic data where laboratory values for most quantities are unknown ) ; however , the agreement of synthetic spectra with observations across a broad class of astrophysical objects is a very good consistency check .",

    "` phoenix `  solves the radiative transfer problem by using the short - characteristic method @xcite to obtain the formal solution of the special relativistic , spherically symmetric radiative transfer equation ( ssrte ) along its characteristic rays .",
    "the scattering problem is solved via the use of a band - diagonal approximation to the discretized @xmath3-operator @xcite as our choice of the approximate @xmath3-operator .",
    "this method can be implemented very efficiently to obtain an accurate solution of the ssrte for continuum and line transfer problems using only modest amounts of computer resources .",
    "we emphasize that ` phoenix `  solves the radiative transfer problem including a full treatment of special relativistic radiative transfer in spherical geometry for all lines and continua .",
    "in addition we enforce the generalized condition of radiative equilibrium in the lagrangian frame , including all velocity terms and deposition of energy from radiative decay or from external irradiation .",
    "we also include a full non - lte treatment of most ions , using model atoms constructed from the data of @xcite and/or from the chianti and aped databases .",
    "the code uses fortran-95 data structures to access the different databases and model atoms from either or both databases can be selected at execution time .",
    "absorption and emission is treated assuming complete redistribution and detailed depth - dependent profiles for the lines .",
    "fluorescence effects are included in the nlte treatment .",
    "the equation of state used includes up to 26 ionization stages of 40 elements as well as up to 600 molecules .",
    "early spectra of supernovae are important to model with synthetic spectra . due to the geometrical dilution ,",
    "early spectra tell us about the composition and velocity structure of the outermost layers of the supernova ejecta .",
    "therefore , they can provide clues to the progenitor structure of sne ia , the primordial composition of all types of supernovae and the nearby circumstellar medium .",
    "@xcite showed that detailed models of the early spectra of sn  1993j could reveal the primordial metalicity as well as the total reddening to the supernova .    with all large computer codes ,",
    "code improvement is an ongoing process .",
    "we recently improved the nlte equation of state and figure  [ fig:93wnewold ] compares the results with and without the improvement .",
    "the change is not dramatic and in the right direction , the newer model fits h@xmath2 better .",

    "the left panel displays a model with a lower temperature and extinction @xmath5 , while the right panel shows a model with a higher temperature and extinction @xmath6 .",

    "the ca ii h+k line is very temperature sensitive at this early phase and the higher extinction is clearly preferred.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ]    in order to determine the values of the fundamental cosmological parameters , an accurate distance indicator visible to high redshift is required .",
    "supernovae are extremely bright and hence can be detected at cosmological distances with modern large telescopes .",
    "the reliability of sne ia as distance indicators improved significantly with the realization that the luminosity at peak was correlated with the width of the light curve @xcite and hence that sne  ia were correctable candles in much the same way that cepheids are @xcite .",
    "this work and the development of highly efficient search strategies @xcite sparked two groups to use sne  ia to measure the deceleration parameter and to discover the dark energy @xcite .",
    "all of the work with sne  ia is empirical , based on observed sne  ia template light curves .",
    "another method of determining distances using supernovae is the `` expanding photosphere method '' ( epm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a variation of the baade - wesselink method @xcite .",
    "the epm method assumes that for sne  iip , with intact hydrogen envelopes , the spectrum is not far from that of a blackbody and hence the luminosity is approximately given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of the photosphere , @xmath9 is the effective temperature , @xmath10 is the radiation constant , and @xmath11 is the `` dilution factor '' which takes into account that in a scattering dominated atmosphere the blackbody is diluted @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature is found from observed colors , so in fact is a color temperature and not an effective temperature , the photospheric velocity can be estimated from observed spectra using the velocities of the weakest lines , @xmath12 the dilution factor is estimated from synthetic spectral models , and @xmath13 comes from the light curve and demanding self - consistency .",
    "this method suffers from uncertainties in determining the dilution factors , the difficulty of knowing which lines to use as velocity indicators , uncertainties between color temperatures and effective temperatures , and questions of how to match the photospheric radius used in the models to determine the dilution factor and the radius of the line forming region @xcite . in spite of this",
    "the epm method was successfully applied to sn  1987a in the lmc @xcite which led to hopes that the epm method would lead to accurate distances , independent of other astronomical calibrators .",
    "recently , the epm method was applied to the very well observed sn  iip 1999em @xcite .",
    "all three groups found a distance of 7.58.0  mpc .",
    "@xcite subsequently used _ hst _ to obtain a cepheid distance to the parent galaxy of sn  1999em , ngc 1637 , and found @xmath14  mpc .    with ` phoenix `",
    ", accurate synthetic spectra of all types of supernovae can be calculated .",
    "the * * s**pectral - fitting * * e**xpanding * * a**tmosphere * * m**ethod ( seam ) @xcite was developed using ` phoenix ` .",
    "while seam is similar to epm in spirit , it avoids the use of dilution factors and color temperatures .",
    "velocities are determined accurately by actually fitting synthetic and observed spectra . the radius is still determined by the relationship @xmath15 , ( which is an excellent approximation because all supernovae quickly reach homologous expansion ) and the explosion time is found by demanding self consistency .",
    "seam uses all the spectral information available in the observed spectra simultaneously which broadens the base of parameter determination .",
    "since the spectral energy distribution is known completely from the calculated synthetic spectra , one may calculate the absolute magnitude , @xmath16 , in any particular band @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the response of filter @xmath17 , @xmath20 is the luminosity per unit wavelength , and @xmath21 is the zero point of filter @xmath17 determined from standard stars .",
    "then one immediately obtains a distance modulus @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the apparent magnitude in band @xmath17 and @xmath24 is the extinction due to dust along the line of sight either in the host galaxy or in our own galaxy .",
    "the seam method does not need to invoke a blackbody assumption or to calculate dilution factors .",
    "using the latest version of ` phoenix `  version 13.06 , we have calculated synthetic spectra of sn  1999em using model s15 of @xcite .",
    "the model was expanded homologously and the gamma - ray deposition was parameterized to be consistent with the nickel mixing found in sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the abundances were taken directly from the model , and the effects of radioactive decay were taken into account .",
    "no attempt was made to adjust the metalicity or helium mixing .",
    "the model had abundances : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn99em_fits ] shows the results are quite close to observed results except at the latest epoch where the blue is strongly dependent on the exact abundances . with these models we are able to obtain a reasonably accurate distance to sn  1999em @xcite .",
    "the synthetic spectra are compared to observed spectra at 5 different epochs .",
    "the observed spectra were obtained at ctio for oct 30 , nov 2 , and nov 18 @xcite , at _ hst _ and flwo on nov 5 @xcite and the optical spectrum on nov 28 was obtained at lick @xcite while the ir was obtained at ctio @xcite .",
    "the observed fluxes have been offset for clarity.,height=151 ]    results from both nearby and high - z searches require quantitative spectroscopy to interpret their results .",
    "results from hydrodynamical calculations also require quantitative spectroscopy to validate / falsify their results .",
    "the seam method applied to both nearby and high - z samples will yield interesting cosmological results .",
    "seam provides a route to obtaining cosmological parameters completely _ independent _ from sne ia .",
