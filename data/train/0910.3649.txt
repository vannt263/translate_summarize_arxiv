    "the low - energy interaction between hadrons contains a parity - violating ( pv ) component due to the weak interactions of quarks contained in the hadrons .",
    "hadronic parity violation has received renewed interest with a number of ongoing and planned experiments @xcite as well as theoretical developments . traditionally , there are two different theoretical approaches to hadronic parity violation .",
    "the most commonly used framework is the one - meson exchange model of desplanques , donoghue and holstein ( ddh ) @xcite . in a different approach by danilov @xcite the pv hadronic interactions",
    "are described in terms of 5 low - energy amplitudes .",
    "more recently , effective field theories ( efts ) have been applied to the problem of hadronic parity violation @xcite .",
    "here we present results of calculations in the framework of pionless effective field theory ( ) . in only nucleon fields appear as dynamic degrees of freedom . at the energies of many of the current and",
    "planned experiments the pion can not be resolved and can be integrated out .",
    "the remaining interactions are given in terms of 5 @xmath1 contact terms , each accompanied by an unknown low - energy constand ( lec ) .",
    "while the lecs can not be predicted within the theory , once they have been determined by comparison with a sufficient number of experimental data the theory has predictive power . as an eft",
    "this approach is model - independent and allows for a systematic improvement of the results .",
    "the results presented here constitute an important step in the determination of the pv low - energy constants .",
    "in all interactions are described by contact terms . in the parity - conserving sector",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are su(2 ) pauli matrices in spin and isospin space , respectively , @xmath5 is the nucleon covariant derivative , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the isoscalar and isovector nucleon magnetic moments .",
    "the partial wave projection operators are defined through @xcite @xmath9 in the power - divergence subtraction scheme @xcite , which we employ in our calculations , the low - energy couplings are given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) scattering length and @xmath15 the renormalization point .",

    "nucleon - nucleon scattering is theoretically the most basic process in which to study hadronic parity violation .",
    "the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total scattering cross section of a polarized nucleon with helicity @xmath22 on an unpolarized nucleon target , would vanish if parity were conserved . with the lagrangians given in sec .",

    "the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath30 is dictated entirely by @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , since the energy dependence of the differential cross sections in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 partial waves differ , a detailed study of the energy dependence of the @xmath34 asymmetry in principle allows an extraction of two different linear combinations of the pv parameters .",

    "we find that at energies for which is applicable coulomb corrections turn out to be small and can be treated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "there exist two experimental results for @xmath35 at @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "while the result at @xmath36 can be used to extract the combination @xcite @xmath38 the energy of @xmath37 lies outside the domain of applicability of .",
    "by choosing suitable neutron polarizations the reaction @xmath0 allows access to two different pv observables . for polarized neutrons",
    "one can determine the photon asymmetry @xmath39 at threshold , which is defined through @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath0 width and @xmath42 the angle between the neutron polarization and the direction of the outgoing photon momentum . at leading order",
    "we obtain @xmath43 note again the appearance of a ratio of pv and pc couplings , indicating that any renormalization point dependence in the weak couplings is driven by those in the strong coupling .",
    "we would also like to point out that we do not require phenomenological wave functions for the deuteron , but treat the deuteron field consistently in the eft framework .",
    "there is an ongoing experimental effort at the spallation neutron source to measure @xmath39 to a sensitivity of @xmath44 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    for unpolarized neutron capture the pv interactions induce a circular polarization of the outgoing photon @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total cross section for photons with positive / negative helicity .",
    "the leading - order result is given by @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the asymmetry in the inverse reaction might be experimentally more feasible and is equal to @xmath45 for exactly reversed kinematics .",
    "current experimental results are consistent with zero in both cases @xcite .",
    "we have presented results for two - body pv observables in the framework of pionless effective field theory , in particular asymmetries in @xmath1 scattering and polarized radiative neutron capture , and an induced photon polarization in unpolarized neutron capture .",
    "these results provide an important step in the determination of the unknown low - energy constants in the pv lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lag : pv ] ) . in order to determine all five parameters",
    "it is necessary to also consider few - body processes . in the future",
