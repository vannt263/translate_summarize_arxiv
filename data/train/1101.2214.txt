    "although preplanetary nebulae ( ppns ) & planetary nebulae ( pns ) evolve from initially spherically  symmetric mass - loss envelopes around agb stars , modern ground - based imaging surveys have shown that the vast majority of the former deviate strongly from spherical symmetry ( e.g. , schwarz , corradi & melnick 1992 , manchado et al .",
    "1996a ) . in a morphologically unbiased survey of young pns with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , sahai & trauger ( 1998 , st98 ) found no round objects , but a variety of bipolar and multipolar morphologies .",
    "the significant changes in the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) morphology during the evolutionary transition from the agb to the post - agb ( pagb ) phase require a primary physical agent or agents which can break the spherical symmetry of the radiatively - driven , dusty mass - loss phase . in the  generalised interacting - stellar - winds \" ( gisw ) model , the agb cse is assumed to be equatorially dense , and the expansion of a fast ( @xmath0 ) isotropic wind from the pn central star produces an aspherical pn ( balick 1987 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations based on this model could reproduce a variety of axisymmetric shapes ( e.g. , review by balick & frank 2002 ) . however , soker ( 1997 , 1990 ) pointed out that the gisw model could not explain the presence of point symmetry or collimated flows and ansae in pns .",
    "jet - like outflows were first used to explain bipolar morphology in a small sample of nebulae around evolved stars ( morris 1987 , 1990 ) , and the presence of ansae in pns ( soker 1990 ) . faced with the complexity , organization and frequent presence of point - symmetry in the morphologies of their survey pns , st98 proposed that the primary agent for breaking spherical symmetry is a jet or collimated , fast wind ( cfw ) operating during the early post - agb or late agb evolutionary phase .",
    "the cfws are likely to be episodic , and either change their directionality ( i.e. , wobbling of axis , or precession ) or have multiple components operating in different directions ( quasi)simultaneously ( sahai 2004 ) . in the st98 model ,",
    "primary shaping begins _ prior _ to the pn phase , and the variety of pn shapes and structure depends in detail on the cfw characteristics ( direction , strength , opening angle , temporal history ) .",
    "direct evidence for cfws during the pre - pn phase has come from sensitive molecular line observations which reveal the presence of very fast ( few@xmath1100 ) molecular outflows in ppns and a few very late agb stars , with huge momentum - excesses showing that these winds can not be radiatively driven ( e.g. , bujarrabal et al . 2001 , sahai et al .",
    "using stis / hst , a carbon star , v hya , has been  caught in the act \" of ejecting a very fast ( 250 ) , highly collimated blobby outflow ( sahai et al .",
    "strong support for the st98 model was recently provided by a ( morphologically ) unbiased hst imaging survey of young ppns which shows very close similarities in morphology between these objects and young pns ( sahai et al .",
    "2007a : smsc07 ) .",
    "if the st98 model is correct , then the question arises : what is the engine for producing cfw s ?",
    "if point - symmetric shapes result from the flow collimator precessing or becoming unstable , then what causes the destabilization ? can cfw s be produced by single stars or is a binary companion essential ?",
    "single - star models have invoked stellar rotation , strong magnetic fields , or both ( e.g. , garcia - segura et al 1999 , blackman et al . 2001 ) , and binary models have invoked the angular momentum and/or the gravitational influence of a companion ( e.g. , morris 1981,1987 , soker & livio 1994 , livio & pringle 1997 ) . yet , in spite of vigorous debate ( e.g. , bujarrabal et al .",
    "2000 ) , no consensus has yet emerged even as to which of the above two broad classes of models is correct ( balick & frank 2002 ) !",
    "morphological classification schemes can play an important role in constraining the physical mechanism or mechanisms that influence the mass loss process .",
    "several pn classification schemes have been presented previously .",
    "the major themes of the earliest classifications were based on whether objects were round or elliptical ( zuckerman & aller 1986 ) .",
    "these were refined with the inclusion of bipolar objects and recognition of objects with point symmetry .",
    "the most detailed of such schemes has been presented in papers by schwarz et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , schwarz , corradi & stanghellini ( 1993 : scs93 ) , and corradi & schwarz ( 1995 : cs95 ) , based on a sample of 400 objects , with four morphological classes : elliptical ( includes round objects ) , bipolar , point - symmetrical , and irregular .",
    "manchado et al .",
    "( 1996a : metal96 ) have published an atlas of 243 pns ( non - refereed ) , and presented a morphological classification which is similar to the one described by cs95 .",
    "however , all of these earlier schemes are based on ground - based imaging , which gives a typical angular resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "this resolution precludes recognition of the important morphological traits of most pns , especially if they are young and therefore physically small .",
    "but even for larger and well - resolved objects , a major difficulty arises due to the typical brightness distribution of a bipolar or multipolar pn ",
    "such pns have waists that are very bright , compared to their extended lobes , and the convolution of such a distribution with a seeing gaussian function whose size is comparable to the size of the waist , can result in a shape which looks roughly elliptical . but profiting from the capabilities of hst , several pn surveys have been carried out , revealing the structures of pns with unprecedented detail  these can not be adequately described by the previous classification schemes . now is an appropriate time for undertaking a new classification scheme that is more detailed , inclusive , and precise than the previous ones , and that can best elucidate the predominant physical processes that contribute to the observed morphologies .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a comprehensive morphological classification system for these objects , based on such a system for ppns devised using their unbiased hst imaging survey of the latter ( smsc07 ) .",
    "smsc07 found a wide variety of morphologies in ppns , qualitatively similar to those found for young pns , which is physically intuitive , since young pns represent the immediate evolutionary phase after the ppn phase .",
    "we have therefore extended the smsc07 ppn classification system to _ young _ pns ( for an operational definition of  young pns \" , see  [ obs ] ) . unlike previous classification studies",
    ", we have focussed primarily on young pns rather than all pns , because the former best show the influences or symmetries imposed on them by the dominant physical processes operating at an earlier stage of the shaping process .",
    "older pns lose these characteristics due to the continued operation of the very fast central star wind and photoionization , and associated dynamical instabilities .",
    "further , interaction with the ism becomes important for old pns , and can introduce a new set of morphological features in these objects ( dgani & soker 1998 ) .",
    "we show that the morphological system for ppns can be adapted for young pns directly , but with modifications and extensions .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ obs ] , we summarise the selection criteria of our sample , and the various hst surveys and other go programs from which the images have been taken ; in  [ result ] , we describe the primary classes (  [ primary ] ) , the secondary characteristics (  [ secondary ] ) , the determination of nebular expansion ages (  [ age ] ) , classification statistics (  [ stats ] ) , the limitations imposed by imaging resolution , sensitivity and nebular orientation effects (  [ effects ] , application of our classification scheme to a new pn sample([newsamp ] ) , and in  [ discuss ] , we conclude with a discussion on how our classification scheme is relevant for understanding the formation and shaping of planetary nebulae .",
    "the objects included in this work mostly come from several surveys with hst / wfpc2 , most of them fitting the selection criterion of st98 , namely that the [ oiii]@xmath35007/h@xmath4 flux ratio , r@xmath5 , be less than about unity ; we have relaxed this a bit , r@xmath6 , in order to include a larger pn sample ] , used to select young pns .",
    "st98 argue that r@xmath5 is expected to be low in young pns because ( 1 ) the central stars have low effective temperatures ( 25,000 - 40,000k ) , resulting in a low state of nebular excitation and therefore a low [ oiii ] flux for the bulk of the nebular gas , and ( 2 ) young pns are compact , with large dust optical depths towards their central regions , resulting in a large selective extinction of the shorter wavelength [ oiii ] line compared with h@xmath4 , since [ oiii ] is more centrally distributed .",
    "two of the major surveys used in our study , go6353 and 8345 , ( pi : sahai ) were specifically carried out using r@xmath6 as the selection criterion , with the goal of studying young pn morphologies .",
    "the third major survey from which we have selected young pns meeting the st98 criterion is go9356 ( pi : a. zijlstra ) , which covered galactic bulge pns .",
    "smaller numbers of objects which fit the st98 criterion were taken from gto6221 ( pi : j. trauger ) , go8307 ( pi : s. kwok ) and go6347 ( pi : k. borkowski ) . for five objects ( png051.5 + 00.2 , png061.3 + 03.6 , png067.9 - 002.2 , png110.1 + 01.9 , png332.9 - 09.9 ) , that were imaged as part of snapshot surveys for ppns ( go9463 & go10536 , pi : sahai ) , we used the broad - band filter images ( at 0.6  and 0.8 ) available .",
    "we supplemented our sample further with additional objects as follows ( i ) 1 pn , with r@xmath5 formally larger than , but within measurement errors , not significantly different from unity , and ( ii ) 23 pns with r@xmath7 ( generally small - sized , and therefore likely to be young as confirmed by our age estimates , see  [ age ] ) .",
    "most of these images were obtained in hst s snapshot mode , with relatively modest integration times .",
    "the total number of objects that are included in this study is 119 .",
    "a log of the observations is provided in table[obslog ] .",
    "the objects in the table are listed in order of increasing galactic longitude ( first number in the pk or png designation ) ; when the longitude is the same , then in order of decreasing galactic latitude ( second number including sign , in the pk or png designation ) .",
    "the table first lists all objects with r@xmath6 ( from pk000 + 17d1 to png359.2 + 04.7 ) followed by all objects where this ratio is greater than unity ( table[obslog ] ) .",
    "the last column in the table lists the name of the dataset in the hst archive .",
    "a significant fraction of an ongoing new large snapshot survey of pns with the wfc3/hst instrument ( go 11657 , pi : stanghellini ) has recently been completely and the results are in the public domain .",
    "this survey utilises one narrow - band filter ( f502n , covering the [ oiii]@xmath35007 line ) , and 3 broad band filters ( f200lp , f350lp , and f814w ) .",
    "inspection of the images from this survey shows that the f200lp and f350lp bandpasses , which are extremely wide , and cover all major nebular emission lines , including [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath4 , show the morphology most sensitively .",
    "we use the images from this survey to demonstrate that our new morphological classification scheme is comprehensive , as it can adequately describe all the morphologies seen so far in this survey .",
    "all images discussed in this paper which were taken with wfpc2 were downloaded from the hst archive of pipeline - calibrated images maintained at the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) .",
    "the images taken with acs or wfc3 are pipeline - calibrated images downloaded from the stsci / mast archive .",
    "we present the images of all the objects in our sample , with the exception of mycn18 ( png307.5@xmath804.9 ) , in figs.[000 + 17d1][093.9 - 00.1 ] . for most of our objects",
    ", we have used the h@xmath4 ( f656n ) images , since these are best suited to showing the overall nebular structure . in a few cases ,",
    "h@xmath4 images are not available so [ nii ] ( f658n ) images have been used .",
    "a comparison of the morphologies seen in h@xmath4 and [ nii ] images , when both are available , shows that there is very little difference between these in determining their morphological classifications .",
    "for the 4 objects imaged in the go9463 & go10536 programs , we only have images in two broad - band filters ( i.e. , taken with either the f435w & f606w , or the f606w & f814 filters ) . with the exception of one of these ( png332.9 - 09.9 , in which the f606w image is a relatively short exposure one and so the f435w image is used ) , we present the f606w images , since this filter includes the h@xmath4 line , which most likely represents the dominant contribution to the emission seen in the images . for the pns",
    "imaged in emission - lines , the intensity is proportional to the square of the density , hence the dynamic range is quite large . therefore , in order to show the nebular structure optimally , we have used a log - stretch black - and - white image in reverse grey - scale , as well as a false - color one in which the intensity has been processed in order to enhance sharp features , where @xmath9 is the original image , and @xmath10 is obtained by smoothing @xmath9 , as in st98 , fig.1 ] . for the 4 pns observed in broad - band filters ,",
    "the log - stretch black - and - white images show all features of the nebulae adequately , hence only these are shown .",
    "all figures and tabulated results form this paper will be made available to the community via the vizier service of the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) .      the ppn classification system of smsc07 consisted of 4 primary classes based on the overall nebular shape , and several categories of secondary characteristics related to specific properties of the lobes , waist , and haloes , and the presence of point - symmetry .",
    "this scheme is summarised in table[codes ] ( non - italicised text ) .",
    "the four existing primary classes , and the ones that we extend to pns as well , are : b ( bipolar ) , m ( multipolar ) , e ( elongated ) , and i ( irregular ) . the b class ( illustrated for pns in figs.[000 + 17d1][356.9_04.4 ] ) represents objects which show two primary , diametrically opposed lobes , centered on the central star or its expected location .",
    "the pair of lobes must have apinched in \" shape in the region around the center from where they emanate , and/or the lobes should be visible on both sides of a minimum - light - intensity central region ( due to an obscuring dust lane ) .",
    "the m class ( figs.[002 - 03d3][358 - 00d2 ] ) represents objects having two or more primary lobe pairs whose axes are not aligned .",
    "the e class ( figs.[001.2 + 02.1][359.2 + 04.7 ] ) is simply one in which objects are elongated along a specific axis , i.e. , are not round .",
    "the i class ( fig .",
    "[ 003.8 + 05.3][350 + 04d1 ] ) represents objects in which extended circumstellar structure can be seen , but where no obvious lobe or shell - like structures can be identified , and which therefore do not fit in any of the previous categories . as the name implies , class - i objects usually do not display any obvious geometrical symmetry such as axial or point - symmetry .",
    "we extend the smsc07 system to young pns , by adding new primary classes as well as secondary characteristics ( italicised text in table[codes ] ) .",
    "an additional three primary classes have been added .",
    "the first is r ( figs.[004.8 + 02.0][012.2 + 04.9 ] ) , which describes round objects .",
    "the maximum asymmetry for an object to be classified as r ( rather than e ) is @xmath11 , i.e. , the widest extent of the object should be a factor @xmath12 times its average extent .",
    "round objects are rare : of a total of 119 pns , we only find 4 .",
    "note that in the ppn study , smsc07 did not find a single round object .",
    "the second is l ( figs.[001.7 - 04.4][356 - 03d3 ] ) , which describes objects having collimated lobes , but which show no constriction in the central , waist region ",
    "i.e. , the lobes are not pinched - in towards the waist region , which is a requirement for being classified as b , so we do not include them in the b class even though they may be closely related ( see  [ waistevol ] ) . in order for an object to have an l , rather than an e classification",
    ", we require the collimation factor ( defined as the ratio of the total tip - to - tip extent of the lobes to their lateral width ) to be 3 or larger .",
    "the third new primary class is designated s ( figs.[002.9 - 03.9][356.8 + 03.3 ] ) , which describes a small set of objects in which the projection on the sky of the most prominent nebular structure has a two - armed spiral shape .",
    "the apparent spiral structure first becomes evident at some finite radius out from the center , i.e. , the spiral - shaped features do not go all the way in to the center .",
    "no lobe or shell structures can be seen , although diffuse nebulosity may be present .",
    "png356.8 + 03.3 and pk032 + 07#2 are the best examples ( figs.[356.8 + 03.3],[032 + 07d2 ] ) .",
    "two other examples , png002.9 - 03.9 and png008.6 - 02.6 ( figs.[002.9 - 03.9],[008.6 - 02.6 ] ) , show additional structures .",
    "png357.1 - 04.7 ( fig.[357.1 - 04.7 ] ) , also shows a bright , two - armed spiral feature , but each arm is part of the opposing peripheries of a pair of lobes .",
    "this object , classified as b , appears therefore to be a connecting link between the s and the b or l classes .",
    "the well - known , nearby pn , ngc7293 ( the helix nebula ) , with its two spiral - arm like structures observed in molecular - line ( co ) emission ( young et al . 1999 ) , shows considerable similarity to our class s objects .",
    "two additional well - resolved examples of the s shape are ngc6309 ( ground - based images in scm92 , vzquez et al .",
    "2008 ) , and k4 - 55 ( ground - based image in the iac catalog : metal96 ) . in each of these two cases",
    ", one can discern that the spiral - shaped features are the highly brightened sides of very faint lobes .",
    "so it is not entirely clear whether s represents a new primary morphological class , or whether it should be regarded as a special case of bipolar with point - symmetric shape , b , @xmath13 ( see  [ secondary ] ) . while we suspect the latter to be plausible , we retain s as a separate class in view of the fact that some of the s objects show no signs of bipolar lobes .",
    "deeper observations of the s systems can in principle resolve this question .    in the ppn classification study by smsc07 ,",
    "the morphologies are those of the optical continuum , resulting from dust - scattered light , whereas in this study , the morphologies that we are examining and classifying are dominated by h@xmath4 emission , and are therefore indicative of the ionized gas .",
    "this difference should be kept in mind when comparing the two studies . however , as discussed by smsc07 , the observed morphologies in both cases are a very good indicator of the geometric shapes of the lobe walls and other nebular structures .",
    "the presence of secondary structural features in the nebulae is denoted with lower - case letters following the capital letter representing the major class .",
    "below , we provide a brief summary of the secondary descriptors used for our ppn scheme , and introduce new ones which have had to be added in order to accommodate new features seen in pn morphologies . in general , the features to which we have chosen to assign descriptors , are those that appear to be common to multiple pns , and which display some geometric symmetry or order .    for ppn ,",
    "we first added secondary characeristics related to the lobes in the b , m , or e classes ; if the lobes are open ( i.e. , like a vase ) or closed at their outer ends ( i.e. , have a bubble - structure ) they are denoted by @xmath14 or @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we then characterised the central region of ppns , where the presence of a dark obscuring band along the short axis of the nebula ( i.e. , a minimum in an intensity cut taken along the primary long axis of the nebula , and usually described as the  waist \" of the nebula ) was denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "evidence for point - symmetry in the nebular structure was denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "this classification was not applied to axially symmetric objects , even though axial symmetry is a special case of point - symmetry .",
    "the point - symmetry could be of three general types , resulting from ( i ) the presence of 2 or more pairs of diametrically - opposed lobes , denoted as @xmath18 , ( ii ) the distribution of ansae point - symmetrically about the center , denoted as @xmath19 , and ( iii ) the overall geometrical shape of the lobes being point - symmetric , denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "three additional nebular characteristics were included : ( i ) bright , compact knots in diametrically - opposed pairs , normally referred to as ansae , were denoted by @xmath20 ; ( ii ) the presence of minor lobes as , for example , seen in the frosty leo nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "2000a ) , was denoted by @xmath21 , and ( iii ) a skirt - like structure around the primary lobes was denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we define minor lobes as being distinctly smaller and thinner than the main lobes , noting that lobes whose lengths are significantly smaller but whose widths are comparable to those of the major lobes , are likely being foreshortened by projection  in such cases the object is classified as m ( e.g. , pk019 - 05#1,fig.[019 - 05d1 ] , and pk300 - 02#1,fig.[300 - 02d1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of a halo was denoted with @xmath23 , with a qualifier @xmath24 if it had an elongated shape , i.e. , as @xmath25 . if the halo shape could not be determined reasonably , we added @xmath26 , meaning that the shape was indeterminate , that is , as @xmath27 . the presence of arc - like structures in the halo , as for example seen in the egg nebula ( sahai et al .",
    "1998b ) , was denoted by @xmath28 : @xmath29 .",
    "note that it is possible for a halo to have a smaller visible radial extent than the nebular lobes in the images shown .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that the physical radius to which the halo extends is smaller than the lobes , since halo sizes are likely to be brightness limited .",
    "all of these secondary characteristic descriptors have been retained in our pn scheme ; but we have had to add new ones in order to account for the greater diversity of morphological features in pns . these are described below .",
    "the most important distinction between the ppn and pn secondary classifications is related to the appearance of the waist region .",
    "since most surveys of pns have been carried out in emission - line filters covering lines such as h@xmath4 , [ nii]6583 and [ oiii]5007 , the waist almost always appears as a bright feature , rather than a dark feature .",
    "indeed , for a bipolar , multipolar or collimated lobe planetary nebula , the waist is often the brightest structural component , which is understandable since the waist region is much more dense than the lobes . note also that if the waist region is in expansion , then it will continue to flow radially outward from the star as a ppn evolves into a pn .",
    "the central regions of pns with waists are thus , in general , expected to be more exposed and visible than those of the ppns from which they evolve .",
    "consequently , the region between the central star and the periphery of the waist is quite often well - resolved and is usually fainter than the periphery , giving the waist the appearance of a belt or toroid .",
    "hence , we denote the presence of a bright waist region with @xmath30 ( for torus ) .",
    "quite often , the torus region shows significant structure  if this is point - symmetric , as first found in pk285 - 02#1 ( fig.[285 - 02d1 ] ) by sahai ( 2000 ; see his fig.1 ) , we add the qualifier @xmath30 , to the @xmath17 descriptor , i.e. , as @xmath31 . additional examples of pns which have point - symmetric torii are seen in figures[057 - 01d1 ] , [ 005.2 - 18.6 ] , and [ 008.2 + 06.8 ] .    of course , very young pns such as ngc6302 ( matsuura et al .",
    "2005 ) may still have optically thick waists fully or partially obscuring their central stars , and we retain the @xmath16 descriptor for these .",
    "however , we exclude the @xmath32 qualifier for the waist descriptor , which , in the case of ppns , was used to denote a waist region with a sharp radial boundary , because in pns , an abrupt , outer radial boundary is naturally generated in an ionization - bounded medium and therefore does not represent the physical boundary of a radial density distribution . in many bipolar ( b ) ,",
    "multipolar ( m ) or collimated - lobe ( l ) pns , the bright central region departs significantly from the geometry of a torus , i.e. , its extent along the long axis of the nebula is equal to or larger than its extent in the equatorial plane , and quite often has a barrel - shaped appearance . in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath16 or @xmath30 descriptor is inadequate for describing this region ; we therefore define a new descriptor called  barrel - shaped central region \" or @xmath33  figs.[bcr - c ] and[bcr - o ] show a collection of twelve such objects from our sample .",
    "if the ends of the barrel clearly appear to be closed or open , we add the qualifier @xmath15 or @xmath14 , respectively , to this descriptor , i.e. , @xmath34 ( fig.[bcr - c ] ) or @xmath35 ( fig.[bcr - o ] ) ; if no judgment can be made , this qualifier is excluded .",
    "if the brightness distribution inside the central region has significant structure that appears irregular , we add the qualifier @xmath26 : @xmath36 ( e.g. , pk002 - 09#1,pk024 + 03#1 , and pk003 + 02#1 : figs.[002 - 09d1],[024 + 03d1 ] , and [ 003 + 02d1 ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath33 shows point - symmetry ( e.g. , pk235 - 03#1 and pk356 - 03#3 : figs.[235 - 03d1 ] , and [ 356 - 03d3 ] ) , we denote this by adding the qualifier @xmath33 to the point - symmetry descriptor : @xmath37 .",
    "athough ( @xmath26 ) a torus seen with its axis at some large angle to the sky plane and ( @xmath38 ) a barrel - shaped region seen with its axis nearly in the sky plane will both appear elliptical and thus superficially similar in shape , it is usually possible to distingush between these because for case @xmath26 the major axis of the ellipse will be oriented orthogonally to the long axis of the nebula , whereas in case @xmath38 it will be oriented along the long axis .",
    "thus , for example , png001.7 - 04.4 ( fig.[001.7 - 04.4 ] ) is classified as @xmath35 , because the long axis of its bright central region lies along the long axis of the nebula .",
    "the full set of descriptors for the central region ( comprised of the @xmath33 , @xmath16 and @xmath30 descriptors ) is collected under the title  structured central region \" , replacing the phrase  obscuring waist \" which was used in our ppn morphological scheme .",
    "the torus in pk 331 - 02#2 ( fig.[331 - 02d2 ] ) shows a remarkable knotty appearance , giving it a necklace - like appearance , similar to that seen in the ground - based image of the newly discovered pn iphasxj194359.5 + 170901 ( corradi et al .",
    "these authors suggest that this torus results from a common envelope ( ce ) ejection episode ( the central star in this pn is a known binary ) , and the knotty appearance may be either due to density fluctuations created during ce ejection and later exacerbated by the action of the expanding ionization front or the post - agb fast wind , or fragmentation of the ejecta due to radiative shocks .",
    "another example of a knotty torus is found in png097.6 - 02.4 ( fig.[097.6 - 02.4 ] ) , which belongs to a new sample of compact pn recently imaged with hst ( see  [ newsamp ] ) .",
    "if several additional objects with such knotty torii are found , we would recommend adding a qualifier to the @xmath30 descriptor to capture this feature .",
    "_ inner bubbles",
    "_ + some pns show the presence of small inner bubble structures which appear to lie entirely within the defining primary geometric structure characterised by the primary class .",

    "an additional feature of pns which first became evident with the hst imaging of the pn , mycn18 ( sahai et al . 1999 ) is that the central star of the pn can be offset from the center of symmetry of the nebula .",
    "the nebular structures in mycn18 have a very high degree of geometric symmetry , and the central star location has been shown to be offset from the centers - of - symmetry of the former ( such as the waist , and the hourglass lobes ) ( figs .",

    "the measurements of such offsets is not straightforward , and requires different strategies , on a case - by - case basis .",

    "we include the offset of the central star from the nebular center of symmetry in units of milliarcsec , with the number of significant figures giving an indication of the accuracy or reliability of the measurement . in cases where there are several geometric structures in the nebula relative to whose center the offset of the central star can be measured ( as , e.g. , in mycn18 ) , we select the largest of these offsets .",
    "the main goal of this descriptor is to _ indicate _ whether the offset is so small ( closer to 0 than to @xmath52 ) as to be not measurable , or if it is evident .",
    "if scientific analysis is to be done based on the offset , then the actual measurements and their uncertainties in the literature will need to be directly confronted .",
    "we use * ( 0 ) for objects in which offsets are well measured to be zero ( i.e. , closer to 0 than to @xmath52 ) , distinguishing them from those objects for which we just have * ( i.e. , inadequate information on the offset ) .",
    "the morphological classifications for our sample of young pns are given in table[morphs ] .",
    "we classify mycn18 , a striking and demonstrative example of many of the secondary characteristics of our scheme , as b , o , t,*(480),an , ib , wv , rg , ps(s , an ) .",
    "the age of each object has been calculated using its angular size , distance , and radial outflow velocity .",
    "these parameters are listed in table[morphs ] .",
    "the angular size of each pn was measured along its longest axis , using the typically well - defined edge of the nebular structure , excluding the halo ( which is scattered light from the outflowing remnant of the agb mass - loss ) . for",
    "those pns , where the edge is not clear , or does not exist because the lobes are not closed along the long axis , we have drawn a vector showing the adopted size . in some cases , where one lobe of the nebula is much fainter than the other ( or lies outside the image field of view ) so that its outer boundary can not be determined reliably , we have used the radial length from the central star to the tip of the bright lobe as a measure of half the nebular size .",
    "our main source for distances is the online version of the acker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) catalog .",
    "there are several methods used for estimating the distances presented in that catalog .",
    "our first choice is to take values from the local extinction study ( labelled e in the catalog ) .",
    "when multiple e values were found , the average was used . in the absence of extinction values , either the kinematical distance ( labelled k in the catalog ) or the spectroscopic parallax distance of binary companions ( labelled s in the catalog ) was used . for objects for which none of the above distances was available , we used the median values of all the distances listed in the acker et al . catalog . for objects without distances in the acker",
    "catalog , we examined the published literature ; for these the relevant references are listed in the footnotes to table,[morphs ] .",
    "the [ nii ] expansion velocities from acker et al . were used in calculating the sizes of each object ; if the [ nii ] data were missing , the [ oiii ] expansion velocity was used . for objects where both the [ nii ] and [ oiii ] expansion velocities were absent ,",
    "the median of all known [ nii ] expansion velocities for objects in our table was used ( 22 ) .",
    "the ages were then calculated by dividing the physical size of each object by twice the expansion velocity .",
    "although an accurate determination of expansion ages for our objects requires that we take into account the inclination and a 2-dimensional model of the geometry of the expanding structures , the approximation used here is adequate for obtaining rough estimates .",
    "we find that most of our objects are relatively young , with a median age of 2470yr , consistent with our expectation based on the st98 selection criterion .",
    "the median age of the 23 objects with r@xmath7 is 2880yr , so these are generally young objects as well .",
    "the expansion velocities for bipolar pns are usually found to be significantly higher in the lobes than in the waist or central regions , as is the case for bipolar ppns .",
    "thus , for most bipolar and multipolar objects , our derived ages are likely to be upper limits because the measured velocities are some global average that is less than the polar expansion velocities .",
    "when the expansion velocity is taken from [ oiii ] data , its value is expected to be smaller than the actual expansion velocity in the lobes , since the [ oiii ] emission is significantly more confined to the central region of pns , and the expansion of the waist / central region is generally much slower than that of the lobes : the derived age is thus again an upper limit .",
    "we have calculated the fractions of objects in different primary classes ( table[t5-stats ] ) , both using the sub - sample of pns in which r@xmath6 ( 96 objects ) and the full sample ( 119 objects ) : the differences are not statistically significant .",
    "we find that the class - b and class - e objects represent about @xmath53% of the total population ",
    "although the fraction of class - e is slightly more than class - b , the difference is only at the 1@xmath54 level .",
    "the class - m objects represent 20% of the population , somewhat smaller than the class - b objects .",
    "the three classes with collimated lobe structures ( b , m & l ) as a whole , represent slightly more than half the population : this must be considered a lower limit because objects in any of these 3 classes can appear to belong to class - e if they are distant and not well - resolved , or if they are projected in such a way that their polar axis makes a relatively small angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "objects in each of the remaining classes ( i , r , l , and s ) represent less than 10% each of the total .",
    "the total numbers of objects in each of these classes is rather small , hence the differences in their populations are not significant or only marginally so .",
    "we note that point - symmetry is widespread , occurring ( in one or more of its different types ) in 45% of our sample .",
    "although our sample is not complete , it is representative of young pns , and the statistics presented here are significant because the sample is drawn from observing programs which are not biased towards any specific morphological class .",
    "we apply our new morphological classification scheme to a new sample of pne recently imaged as part of an ongoing snapshot survey of pns ( table[t5 ] ) .",
    "although this survey did not include narrow - band filters covering either the h@xmath4 or the [ nii ] lines , inspection of the survey images shows that the f200lp and f350lp bandpasses , which are extremely wide , and cover all major nebular emission lines , including [ oiii ] , [ nii ] and h@xmath4 , show the morphology most sensitively ( e.g. , fig.[356.5 + 01.5 ] ) .",
    "a representative fraction of the imaged objects is shown in figs.[356.5 + 01.5][344.8 + 03.4 ] .",
    "we find that our scheme can adequately describe all the morphologies seen in this sample , showing that it is quite comprehensive .",
    "our classification of any specific object may be affected by angular resolution , sensitivity and the object s orientation .",
    "our scheme is aimed at minimizing the importance of orientation , but projection effects unavoidably affect the classification for extreme inclinations .",
    "a class - b or l nebula , with its long axis oriented at a small angle to the line of sight , will appear to be merely elongated ( i.e. , class e ) .",
    "a barrel - shaped configuration viewed from near its axis will appear toroidal , or simply round , and an elongated halo can be projected to appear circularly symmetric . in those cases where we suspect that the geometrical projection of the nebula plays a role in determining its classification ,",
    "we have so indicated in the notes on individual objects in table[morphs ] .",
    "sensitivity , which depends on the exposure times , has the biggest affect on the detection and classification of the halo region , which generally has a much lower surface brightness than the bright nebular shell .",
    "so it is possible , and perhaps likely , that many of our objects possess faint haloes which are below the limit of our detection .",
    "given hst s resolution of @xmath55 , and pixel sizes typically @xmath56 , we find that when the angular size is smaller than about @xmath57 ( e.g. , figs.[004.8 - 22.7 ] , [ 355.9 + 03.6 ] ) , but greater than about @xmath58 , most secondary descriptors listed under _ central region _ in table[codes ] , some of those listed under _ other nebular characteristics _ ( such as @xmath39 and @xmath42 ) , and the qualifiers for point symmetry in the central region , namely @xmath59 , can not be reliably assigned .",
    "when the angular size is smaller than about @xmath58 , in addition to the above limitations , objects that are intrinsically b , m , or l may appear to be have a primary classification of e , and most secondary characteristics listed under _ lobes _",
    ", _ central region _ , and _ other nebular characteristics _ in table,[codes ] can not be reliably assigned ( although it may still be possible to distinguish an overall point - symmetry in the shape ( i.e. , @xmath13 , see e.g. , fig.[326 - 06d1 ] ) ) .",
    "however , only a small fraction of objects in our sample is affected by insufficient angular resolution : 8 objects in our sample have angular sizes @xmath60 , and 4 of these 8 have sizes @xmath61 .    the errors in the determination of the angular extent affect the derivation of parameters such as age and diameter only in the smallest objects ( size @xmath62  ) , but are still small compared to the systematic uncertainties in these estimates due to the poorly known distances , and/or expansion velocities .    the morphological assignment may be ambiguous if the image is not of sufficiently good quality , and we have added question marks to descriptors for which we judge the assignment to be somewhat ambiguous . furthermore ,",
    "if the image is too poor to assign a classification for any particular characteristic , we simply did not include it in the classification .",
    "we expect the classifications to be refined , and possibly altered in some respects , as deeper and/or higher - resolution images become available .",
    "the images presented in this paper forcefully demonstrate why high - resolution imaging available from a space - based observatory like hst , as opposed to seeing - limited ground - based facilities , is critical , even for objects with an overall extent an order of magnitude larger than the seeing - limited resolution . in the ground - based images , not only",
    "are important structural features not discernible , even the qualitative assesment of the basic morphological class in a given classification scheme ( e.g. whether the pn is elliptical or bipolar ) can be incorrect (  [ intro ] ) .",
    "this is because the waist regions of pns are much brighter than the polar lobes - when convolved with a large seeing disk , the spatial spread of the waist region to a given intensity level is much larger than that of the much fainter polar regions - so a bipolar nebula can look artificially elliptical .",
    "two striking examples of this effect are provided by the objects pk 300 - 02#1 and pk000 + 17#1 .",
    "pk 300 - 02#1 , a bipolar nebula with a very large aspect ratio ( 7:1 ) ( fig.[300 - 02d1 ] ) , looks like an unremarkable elliptical nebula with a much smaller aspect ratio ( 1.6:1 ) from the ground ( grny et al .",
    "similarly , pk000 + 17#1 , whose ground - based image by scm92 shows a featureless elliptical blob of size about 7@xmath158 , is actually an extreme bipolar nebula with a polar extent of @xmath63 , and a waist of width 13 ( fig.[000 + 17d1 ] ) .",
    "thus the fraction of pns which are bipolar is likely to be severely underestimated from ground - based imaging studies , with important implications for any hypothesis for their formation .    in this paper",
    "we have applied our morphological classification scheme developed for ppns to young pns , with modifications and extensions .",
    "this ready applicability of our previous scheme substantiates its validity and results from the strong morphological similarities between these two classes of objects evident in current imaging surveys with hst .",
    "one view , which has often been expressed at a series of international conferences devoted to understanding the formation of aspherical pns ( apn i - iv : e.g. , corradi , manchado & soker 2009 ) , is that understanding ppn shapes is not a prerequisite to understanding pn shapes because ionization will destroy much or all the detailed geometric structure we see in highly - structured ppns ( e.g. , multipolar objects like iras19024 + 0044 ) . but given the striking similarities which we report between ppn and pn shapes ( e.g. , between iras19024 + 0044 and the starfish twin pns ) , this view does not appear to be valid .",
    "the overall preservation of ppn shapes as they transform to pns is likely a consequence of the following two causes : ( 1 ) the ionization fronts get trapped inside the dense walls of the nebular lobes , and ( 2 ) even if all of the lobe material in a ppn gets ionised , it maintains its shape , since its expansion velocity significantly exceeds the sound speed in ionised gas ( 10 ) .",
    "current observations of several bipolar and multipolar ppns provide evidence that their lobes are expanding at very high velocities ( @xmath64100 ) .      the comparison between the ppn and pn samples , and the resulting new morphological descriptors , highlight the task ahead of us in trying to understand the formation of aspherical planetary nebulae .",
    "the emergence of new morphological features in pns signifies the operation of new physical processes affecting the nebular shapes , as ppns evolve into pns .",
    "we must first consider the shaping which occurs during the ppn phase , which is the primary shaping stage ( smsc07 ) . during this phase , ( 1 )",
    "the dense mass - loss of the agb phase has already ceased and the inner edge of the dense circumstellar shell is advancing outward , and ( 2 ) a collimated , fast wind ( i.e. , the cfw ) is sculpting the dense shell from the inside out .",
    "as the central star evolves towards higher temperatures , the primary shaping is followed by the action of the spherical , radiatively - driven , fast wind from the pn central star ( hereafter srfw ) , on the pre - shaped nebula .",
    "the fact that we see the biggest changes between ppns and pns in the central waist region clearly supports this scenario , since the waist material is the first to be encountered by the wind from the pn central star .",
    "the central regions of waists are expected to be more exposed and visible during the pn stage compared to the ppn stage , because the waists seen in ppns are likely expanding structures , and further clearing of the central region occurs as a result of the srfw .",
    "the closed ( @xmath15 ) and open ( @xmath14 ) qualifiers on the @xmath33 descriptor of the central region are diagnostic of differences in its structure during the preceding evolutionary phases .",
    "thus , one may imagine that the @xmath34 central regions result from the inflation of an originally compact structure that surrounded the central star in all directions , when the object was a ppn .",
    "such a dusty structure has been proposed to surround the central star in the well - studied ppn , crl2688 , by sahai et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath35 central regions may be produced in objects by the inflation of a highly flared disk or a toroidal central region .",
    "the inflating agent in both cases is the srfw .",
    "a possible example of an object showing such inflation of a torus into a @xmath35-type central region is pk002 - 09#1 ( fig.[002 - 09d1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of irregular structure in the central region , captured by the @xmath26 qualifier , may result from hydrodynamical instabilties produced during its inflation ; the presence of geometric structure , captured by the @xmath65 qualifier , is less easily understood .",
    "one possibility is that the collimated jet - like outflows which we know operate during the ppn phase remain active as the central star evolves to higher temperatures and starts driving the srfw ;",
    "the combined interaction of these two fast winds with themselves and the central region then results in either irregular or geometric structure of the latter , depending on the relative speeds and momentum fluxes of these winds .    the continued evolution of a pn having a barrel - shaped central region ( @xmath33 ) and a b- , m- or l- primary classification , may result in an object whose primary structure appears to be e , because the lobe regions have become too tenuous to be seen and only the bright @xmath33 region is visible .",
    "a possible example of this phenomenon is pk327 - 02#1 ( fig.[327 - 02d1 ] ) , where a pair of very faint lobes may be present , emanating from the top and bottom parts of the periphery of the elongated central region .",
    "this possibility could be tested out using deep imaging in low - excitation nebular lines such as [ nii ] and [ oi ] , which may reveal such lobes .",
    "there is a natural morphological continuity in primary classes from b , to l , to those which are e and have the @xmath30 secondary characteristic .",
    "it is likely that class - l objects , or class - e objects having the @xmath30 descriptor , were b earlier on in their evolution , but continued expansion of their waist regions as these objects evolved resulted in the loss of the pinched - in waist as the latter expanded out to become the toroidal feature .",
    "our survey shows that round pns are rare : only 3.4% of our sample belongs to the r class .",
    "soker ( 2002 ) discussed the rarity of round pns ; he proposed that most pns evolve from binaries , which both enhances the agb mass - loss rates ( as a  final intensive wind \" ) and makes the mass outflows non - spherically symmetric , whereas round pns are objects which evolve from single stars ( i.e. , have no close companions , stellar or substellar ) ; they also have low metallicity , so the agb mass - loss rate is low , thus resulting in a relatively faint pn .",
    "hence such objects are difficult to find .",
    "in contrast to the occurrence of r objects in our sample of pns , there is a complete lack of round ppn ( smsc07 ) .",
    "we hypothesize that this difference indicates that ( i ) a fast wind is needed in order to carve out the aspherical cavities inside the agb cse for a post - agb object to appear as a visible ppn , ( ii ) the fast wind is always collimated , to a smaller or larger degree .",
    "hence , post - agb objects which do not develop such collimated fast winds - i.e. , most likely single stars with no close companions , stellar or substellar  show a shell - like structure only at the pn - phase , once the central star becomes hot enough to produce a srfw , and ionize the swept - up circumstellar shell .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested with an extensive search for round ppns with hst ; if it is correct , we would not find any round ppns .",
    "young pns show more complex morphological features than ppns .",
    "we have already discussed some of these above in connection with the central region .",
    "the addition of new descriptors and qualifiers to the list of secondary characteristics is indicative of new processes that apparently do not occur during the ppn phase .",
    "for example , inner bubbles ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) are likely to represent emission from very hot gas in the reverse shock generated by the srfw . this interpretation is supported most directly by the x - ray imaging observations of ngc6543 ( chu et al .",
    "2001 ) , which show that the x - ray emission comes from an inner structure which would be classified as an inner bubble . in the case of pk215 - 24d1 ( ic418 ) ,",
    "the [ oiii ] image clearly shows enhanced emission in the inner bubble region ( fig.[oiii - ha - ic418 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath42 descriptor , which denotes the presence of small - scale patterns of surface brightness variations over the body of the primary shell structure , may be the result of specific hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "it is noteworthy that , with one exception , all objects with @xmath42 belong to the e primary class .    the radial rays ( labelled by the @xmath43 descriptor ) and searchlight beams ( labelled by the @xmath66 qualifier of the halo descriptor ) may be related phenomena . in the case of the ppn , crl2688 , where these were first discovered , setal98 presented a model in which the beams were the result of an obscuring dust cloud aroud the central star having a specific geometry",
    ": they proposed that the obscuring cloud has annular holes around the symmetry axis of the nebula , allowing the preferential leakage of starlight which illuminates the extended spherical circumstellar envelope to give the searchlight beam features .",
    "it appears plausible then , that when the central star evolves into a hot post - agb star with a srfw , the latter results in partial disintegration of this cloud , destroying its annular hole geometry and resulting in a less spatially - organized distribution of dust around the central star . the ionising radiation from the star",
    "can then be extincted along directions with optically thick dust clumps ; it is along these directions that the radial rays are seen , as ionization shadows .",
    "we have compared our classification scheme with the detailed ones by scs93+cs95 and metal96 , and we find obvious similarities as well as important distinctions ( appendix ) .",
    "we find that our classification system is broader and more comprehensive than the scs93+cs95 and metal96 systems , encompassing a more diverse array of morphologies ( by employing a larger number of secondary descriptors ) , and is also more precise .",
    "these differences have mostly been motivated by the availability of high - resolution images of pns obtained with hst . an important difference between our scheme and those of scs93+cs95 and metal96 , at the primary classification level ,",
    "is their inclusion of a separate point - symmetric class .",
    "the results of our study here show that point - symmetry can be present in objects in a variety of ways for all primary clases except those that belong to the irregular ( i ) class .",
    "further , neither metal96 nor scs93+cs95 have multipolar or spiral - arm classes .",
    "our scheme includes metal96 s class q objects in our m ( multipolar ) class ; it is not yet clear if the quadrupolar objects are distinct from those with more than 2 pairs of lobes .",
    "the scs93+cs95 and metal96 schemes do not include any descriptors for the presence of halos .",
    "an intriguing classification of pns , devised by soker & hadar ( 2002 : sh02 ) , is based on the departure from an axisymmetic shape ( considering only departures along and near the equatorial plane between structures on opposite sides of the nebular symmetry axis ) : sh02 discuss the connection between departure types and the physical mechanisms that may cause them , mainly resulting from the influence of a stellar binary companion .",
    "the pn images and the classification scheme here are relevant to the sh02 study in several ways , the most important of which is the widespread presence of point - symmetry in our pns sample , rather than axial symmetry , which at the very least , severely restricts the sample of pns subject to the sh02 classification .",
    "an possible example of an object in our sample that shows a  bent \" departure from axisymmetry ( as defined by sh02 ) is pk000 + 17#2 ( fig.[000 + 17d1 ] ) .",
    "one of the departures discussed by sh02 relates to the offset of the central star from the  center of the nebula \" : although we have included such an offset in our scheme , we have not implemented it in this paper , because in order to do so , one needs to define objective methods of finding the geometrical center of a nebula , and a quantitative estimate of the resulting uncertainty (  [ staroff ] ) .",
    "the morphological classes constituting the classification scheme presented in this paper were devised with minimal prejudice regarding their underlying physical cause . however , in many cases , physical causes are readily suggested by the geometry , supplemented by the kinematics that have been measured in some systems .",
    "kinematic studies , mostly using high - resolution long - slit spectroscopy ( e.g. , review in lpez et al .",
    "2004 ) , are time - consuming , but will eventually be necessary to fully disentangle the 3-d morphology of pns where projection effects appear to be important .",
    "several of the physical causes have been discussed above where the primary and secondary characteristics are defined .    collimated",
    "lobe structures seen in the b or l classes imply the presence of collimated outflows but can not directly tell us whether the collimation takes place near the central star(s ) or is rather due to deflection by an equatorial concentration of matter , unless point - symmetry is also present .",
    "although many hydrodynamical studies of interacting winds , with different assumptions about their geometries , have been carried out over the years ( e.g. , mellema & frank 1995 , lee & sahai 2003 , garca - arredondo & frank 2004 , dennis et al .",
    "2008 ) , a new and focussed effort of hydrodynamical modelling is needed to address this issue , since simulations of hydrodynamical collimation undertaken so far suggest that the fast outflows are intrinsically collimated .",
    "for example , comparisons of simulations of a spherical wind interacting with an equatorially dense agb envelope  the so - called generalized interacting stellar winds or gisw model ( kwok et al .",
    "1978 , balick 1987 )  does not produce the pinched - in shape of the lobes at their base characterizing class - b objects ( see , e.g. , mellema & frank 1995 ) , even with very high equatorial to polar density contrast ratios .",
    "this discrepancy between data and models of this type highlights the importance of the pinched - in shape of the lobes in class - b pns as a criterion for testing models",
    ".    in all cases , _ point symmetry _ indicates a secular trend ",
    "presumably precession  in the orientation of the central driver of a rapid , collimated outflow .",
    "point - symmetry due to shape , @xmath13 , or the presence of point - symmetric ansae , @xmath19 , implies that the outflows are not collimated by hydrodynamical processes , but are intrinsically collimated , likely driven by a central accretion disk undergoing precession or wobbling of its axis .",
    "numerical simulations are of course needed to verify whether precession can produce the several types of point - symmetry covered in our classification scheme .",
    "a recent study by raga et al . ( 2009 ) is a good first step in this direction . in this study ,",
    "the authors show that models of accretion disks around a star in a binary system predict that the disk will have a retrograde precession with a period a factor of @xmath672 - 20 times the orbital period , and they present an analytic , ballistic model and a three - dimensional gasdynamical simulation of a bipolar outflow from a source in a circular orbit , and with a precessing outflow axis .",
    "they find that this combination results in a jet / counterjet system with a small - spatial - scale spiral which is reflection - symmetric across the equatorial plane ( resulting from the orbital motion ) and a larger - scale , point - symmetric spiral ( resulting from the longer period precession ) .",
    "the multiple lobe pairs in class m objects also require intrinsically collimated flows or ejections .",
    "hypotheses for producing such lobes have been discussed by sahai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in connection with the starfish ppn , iras19024 + 0044 , and include a direction - changing bipolar jet driven by a wobbling accretion disk , or  explosive \" ejections of matter along different directions driven by a correspondingly fast release of magnetic energy from the central star .",
    "a _ waist _ is the signature of a strong equatorial concentration of matter , whether it be outflowing or in a bound keplerian disk . if the equatorial concentration has expanded following a diminution or a cessation of mass loss , then an evacuated _ toroidal _ structure results , ionized and/or illuminated on its inside edge by the radiation from the central star .",
    "if the distribution of outflowing matter is less concentrated toward the system s equatorial plane , then , following the cessation of mass loss , the toroidal configuration will have a large vertical extent , and the ionization and illumination of its inside boundary will present a _",
    "barrel_-shaped appearance .",
    "ideally , one would like to relate nebular characteristics to fundamental , irreducible , physical variables innate to the system .",
    "the nebular morphology , when coupled with velocity measurements , often provides access to variables that relate to the timing , such as the temporal history of the mass loss rate , and in particular the time since the cessation of rapid mass loss .",
    "another innate variable is the presence of a binary companion to the mass - losing star , operationally expressed as the stellar mass ratio , separation and orbital eccentricity .",
    "this variable can affect the degree of concentration of the mass outflow towards the system s equatorial plane ( e.g. , mastrodemos & morris 1999 ) , but in a rather complex way that requires elaborate dynamical modeling of the morphology and the velocity field in order to access those variables .",
    "de marco ( 2009 ) , following soker ( 1997 ) , summarises five main types of pn - shaping binary interactions as a function of just the binary separation . amongst these types , close binaries which avoid a ce interaction ( separation few to @xmath68100au ) or result in one ( separation@xmath68fewau ) , are the ones most likely to produce dramatic departures from spherical symmetry in the central regions . during ce interactions",
    "in which the binary survives , the stellar envelope of the primary star can become unbound as a result of transfer of energy and angular momentum from the secondary ( e.g. , iben & livio 1993 ) , and the ejected mass can be strongly concentrated in the equatorial plane ( sandquist et al .",
    "thus ce ejection is a promising mechanism for producing the waist structure identified in our classification scheme for pns and ppns .",
    "ce interaction may also produce bipolar nebulae more often than single progenitors , as suggested by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who find a  penchant for bipolarity \" in a sample of 30 post - ce pns .",
    "another variable related to binarity is the rate of stellar rotation , which is likely to be significant enough to affect the geometry of the mass outflow only if a stellar merger has taken place during a ce interaction , or if tidal interaction in a close binary has synchronized the primary rotation with the orbit of the secondary .",
    "other fundamental variables enter the picture if a stellar magnetic field plays a role in shaping the stellar mass outflow ( e.g. , pascoli 1997 , chevalier & luo 1994 ; garca - segura 1997 , garca - segura et al .",
    "1999 , blackman et al .",
    "2001 ) : the magnetic geometry , strength , and orientation .",
    "however , soker ( 2006 ) argues that in order to sustain a sufficiently strong global magnetic field for an adequate period of time during which mass can be ejected in a collimated manner , angular momentum needs to be continuously supplied to the star , and this can only come from a companion , hence magnetic fields may play a role , but are perhaps not the fundamental underlying agent shaping pns .",
    "additional innate variables are needed to account for the point symmetry displayed by a large fraction ( almost 50% ) of the nebulae presented here ( e.g. , variables relating to the coupling of orbital and rotational angular momenta might be important in this context , but the cause of the precession of the central driver has not been identified yet in any system ) . finally , we note that yet unidentified variables may be needed to account for the multipolarity of many systems and for the arc features and other discontinuities observed in the halos of many well - observed pns and ppns .",
    "it is clear that this will remain a dynamic area of research for some time to come .",
    "we would like to thank bruce balick and his students for producing their web catalog of hst pn images , which was helpful in the compilation of part of the pn sample used in this paper .",
