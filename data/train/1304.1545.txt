    "when a star wanders too close to a massive black hole it is shredded by the strong tidal gravity of the bh . in this process a fraction of the star is captured by the bh and is eventually accreted , and roughly half of the stellar mass is flung out on hyperbolic orbits ( lacy et al .",

    "the accretion disk is expected to produce blackbody radiation in uv and soft x - ray bands from the region close to the bh , and a bright optical flash is produced by a super - eddington outflow and by the irradiation and photo - ionization of unbound stellar debris ( strubbe & quataert 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "generation of a relativistic jet is also expected to accompany a tidal disruption event ( tde ) as the stellar material bound to the bh gravity is accreted over a period of time ; we know empirically that accreting bhs in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) produce jets moving at speed close to that of light with lorentz factor of order 10 .",

    "the mm & radio light curves for sw j1644 + 57 were found to be flat / rising for @xmath6days by berger et al .",
    "these authors suggested that this implies continuous injection of energy to the decelerating blast wave , which produced this radiation , for @xmath6d .",

    "this energy requirement of more than a few times @xmath8erg is very difficult to satisfy for a tde model .",

    "some concluding remarks about this event can be found in  5 .",
    "swift / xrt found that the x - ray flux from sw j1644 + 57 varied rapidly on time scale @xmath9s , indicating that the emission was probably produced at a distance of order @xmath10 cm ; @xmath11 is jet lorentz factor . the average x - ray flux was roughly constant for the first 5 days , then dropped suddenly by a factor 50 during the next 3 days , and subsequently for @xmath12d it declined as @xmath13 ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ; berger et al . 2012 ; zauderer et al .",
    "the x - ray flux then declined further by a factor @xmath14 between 500 days and 600 days ( zauderer et al .",
    "the spectrum in the 0.310 kev swift / xrt band is reported to be a power law function  @xmath15  with index @xmath16 during the first @xmath17days and then decreasing to @xmath18 a few hundred days after the tidal disruption .",
    "this transient event received extensive coverage at multiple mm and radio frequencies . depending on the frequency band",
    "the light curve was found to rise , or remained nearly flat , during the first 100 days , and then declined as roughly @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum at low frequencies ( @xmath20hz ) rose as @xmath21 which is roughly consistent with that expected of a synchrotron spectrum below the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "and the spectrum above the peak of @xmath23 fell off as @xmath24 .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ( @xmath22 ) underwent a dramatic decline by a factor of 10 between 5 and 10 days , and subsequently @xmath22 displayed a very slow decline over the next several hundred days .",
    "the flux at the peak of the spectrum fell off during 510 days by a factor @xmath25 , then increased by a factor @xmath26 during 1010@xmath27 days ( berger et al .",
    "it should be noted that these peculiar behavior of the radio data during the period 510 days coincided with a sharp decline of the x - ray flux by a factor @xmath6 , e.g. burrows et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "the event was also observed in the infrared k - band ( @xmath28hz ) multiple times between 5 and 50 days , and the flux was found to decline during the first 5 days as @xmath29 ( levan et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "one of the main puzzles posed by the rich data for this event is that light curves in @xmath30ghz frequency bands , which lie above the synchrotron absorption and other characteristic frequencies , show a flat or a rising behavior when in fact according to the external forward shock model these light curves should be declining as @xmath31 , e.g. meszaros & rees ( 1994 ) , chevalier and li ( 2000 ) , panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) , granot and sari ( 2002 ) .",
    "energy injection to the decelerating external blast wave between 10 and @xmath32 days by a factor @xmath33 has been invoked , e.g. berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , to prevent the decline of the radio light curve during this time interval .",
    "this huge amount of energy added to the blast wave , however , leaves no x - ray foot print , and that clearly is very puzzling for @xmath34d , and therefore according to the x - ray data most of the energy release in relativistic jet took place during the first 5 days . ] .",
    "the model we suggest  ic cooling of electrons by x - ray photons  avoids this problem because it requires no energy addition to the decelerating external shock to flatten radio / mm light curves .",
    "two other puzzles suggested by the data are the precipitous decrease of @xmath22 by a factor 10 between 5 and 10 days , and the rapid fall off of the infrared light curve during the same period .",
    "* basic idea : * relativistic jet from the tde interacts with the cnm ( circum - nuclear medium ) and drives a strong shock wave into it ) is not much larger than 1 .",
    "the mechanism described in this paper can also be applied to reverse shock emission . however , the external reserve - shock has difficulties explaining the observed flat radio / mm light curves . ] .",
    "cnm electrons accelerated by the shock radiate synchrotron photons at radio and higher frequencies .",
    "these electrons are cooled by the ic scattering of x - ray photons streaming through the shocked plasma ( these x - ray photons are the same radiation that was observed by the swift satellite ) ; see fig . 1 for a schematic sketch of this scenario .",
    "since the x - ray flux declines rapidly with time ( @xmath35 for @xmath36 days ) , the ic cooling of electrons also diminishes with time and this is what is responsible for transforming an otherwise declining light curve ( @xmath37 ) to a flat or a rising light curve in radio / mm band ; the ic cooling by x - rays turns out to be very effective in suppressing synchrotron radiation in mm / cm bands at early times , and this suppression gets weaker with time as the x - ray flux declines .",
    "one other thing we should address here for those who might be thinking that the observed spectrum above the peak ( @xmath38 ) is too shallow to be consistent with a fast electron cooling model .",
    "the observed parameters of swift j1644 + 57 are such that ic scatterings for electrons radiating above the peak takes place in the klein - nishina regime , and hence the shallow observed spectrum ; detailed calculations are presented in  3.1 & 3.2 .    since the main component of our proposed idea to explain radio / mm",
    "light curve behavior is ic cooling of electrons in the external shock by the observed x - ray radiation , we begin the technical part of this section with a description of this process .",
    "we show that it is unavoidable that ic cooling by x - ray photons significantly modifies electron distribution in the external shock for sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "we also discuss whether ic scatterings take place in the thomson or klein - nishina ( k - n for short , from now on ) regime .",
    "finally , we calculate electron distribution function when ic cooling due to an external x - ray radiation field occurs in the k - n regime .",
    "let us consider a x - ray radiation source with luminosity @xmath39 ( isotropic equivalent ) in frequency band @xmath40@xmath41 which is produced by a source of size @xmath42 .",
    "its specific luminosity scales as @xmath43 ; all unprimed variables are quantities measured in the rest frame of the host galaxy of the source .",
    "now consider electrons in external forward shock at a radius @xmath44 , and the lorentz factor of the shocked plasma ( wrt cnm rest frame ) to be @xmath45 .",
    "a photon of frequency @xmath46 moving at an angle @xmath47 wrt the radial direction is doppler shifted to frequency @xmath48 in shock comoving frame : @xmath49 ,     \\label{nup}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and we used taylor expansion for @xmath51 , and @xmath52 to arrive at the approximate expression for @xmath48 . from hereon",
    "all primed variables denote shock comoving frame .",
    "the specific intensity in the host galaxy rest frame is @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and is zero otherwise .",
    "the specific intensity in the comoving frame of the shocked fluid is obtained by an appropriate lorentz transformation , e.g. rybicki & lightman ( 1986 ) , and is given by @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the specific flux in the comoving frame is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angular size of the x - ray source as seen in the shock comoving frame .",
    "and the frequency integrated flux is @xmath59 the factor @xmath60 in the denominator is easy to understand as it is due to lorentz transformation of energy density .    the equation for ic cooling of an electron of lorentz factor @xmath61 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is thomson scattering cross section",
    "at the moment we are ignoring k - n effect which we will take up shortly .",
    "thus , ic cooling time is given by @xmath64 where we made use of equation ( [ fxp ] ) for @xmath65 , and have adopted the widely used notation @xmath66 .",
    "the ic cooling calculation assumed that the external shock region is optically thin for x - ray photons .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied since the optical depth to thomson scattering is @xmath67 as long as @xmath68 , the particle density in the unshocked cnm , is less than 10@xmath69@xmath70 at a distance of 10@xmath71 cm from the black hole which is indeed the case as shown by radio observations . also , absorption of x - ray photons by the inverse - synchrotron process is negligibly small .",
    "the dynamical time in the comoving frame is @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 the lorentz factor of the external shock a week after the tidal disruption is about 2 ( see  3.2 for shock dynamics ) , @xmath74 , and @xmath75x@xmath76erg / s .",
    "thus we see from the above equation that the ic cooling time for electrons with @xmath77 is shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "radio and mm photons observed from sw j1644 + 57 are produced via synchrotron process by electrons with @xmath78 , and so ic cooling can not be ignored in the calculation of external shock radiation from this event .",
    "it should be pointed out that the synchrotron cooling is less important than the ic cooling at least for those electrons that are radiating well below the infrared band for the shocked fluid is smaller than 1 . ] .    for electrons with @xmath79 the ic scatterings",
    "take place in the thomson regime for sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "the reason is that the energy of a 10 kev photon  swift / xrt energy band is 0.310 kev  in the electron comoving frame is ( @xmath80 ) kev which is less than @xmath81 as long as @xmath82 .",
    "higher energy electrons scatter 10 kev photons with a reduced cross - section . ] , and the scattered photon energy is less than it is in the thomson regime , i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "these two effects reduce the ic cooling of electrons with @xmath84 . a simple , and fairly accurate , way to include these effects in ic cooling calculations",
    "is by only considering energy density in radiation field up to a photon energy of @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is planck s constant .",
    "the spectral index in the x - ray band for swift j1644 + 57 is @xmath88 , and in that case the reduction to the ic cooling due to k - n effect scales as @xmath89 for large @xmath61 ( see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "this is a weak effect but has important implications for electron distribution function which is discussed below .",
    "electron distribution function , @xmath90 , in a shocked plasma is determined by the dual effect of acceleration at the shock front and ic and synchrotron coolings while electrons travel down - stream .",
    "the distribution function is obtained from the following equation : @xmath91 = s(\\gamma_e ) ,    \\label{ne_dot}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 \\gamma_e^2\\beta_e^2 ,     \\label{gamma_e_dot}\\ ] ] is the rate of change of @xmath93 due to ic and synchrotron losses , @xmath94 is energy density in radiation below the k - n frequency @xmath95 ( eq . [ nu_kn ] ) , and @xmath96 is the rate at which electrons with lf @xmath93 are injected into the system ; @xmath97 is the minimum lorentz factor for shock accelerated electrons .",
    "all the variables considered in this subsection are in shock comoving frame .",
    "however , we will not use prime (  ) on variables in this sub - section ( and only in this sub - section ) to denote shock comoving frame as this is the only frame being considered here .",
    "when results from this sub - section are used elsewhere in the paper we will revert back to the proper notation for prime and un - prime frames .",
    "let us define radiative cooling time @xmath98 and cooling lorentz factor , @xmath99 , which is such that @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the dynamical time .",
    "we will calculate the distribution function in two cases .",
    "the slow cooling case where @xmath102 , and the fast cooling regime when @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we will consider here only ic losses in k - n regime as that is relevant for the `` afterglow '' radiation of the tde swift j1644 + 57 .",
    "we note that the theoretical light curves and spectra shown for this event in the next section are obtained by numerical solutions of relevant equations that include synchrotron loss and no assumption regarding k - n regime .    since @xmath104 ( eq . [ nu_kn ] ) and @xmath105 , therefore @xmath106 .",
    "we see from equation ( [ ne_dot ] ) that for @xmath107 @xmath108 whereas for @xmath109 @xmath110 therefore , the solution of equation ( [ ne_dot ] ) in the slow cooling case is @xmath111 and in the fast cooling case @xmath112    the synchrotron spectrum for particle distribution @xmath113 is @xmath114 for @xmath115 , and it is @xmath116 for @xmath117 ; these spectra are modified when synchrotron - absorption becomes important ( the criterion for this is discussed in the next sub - section ) .",
    "it should be clear from these equations that the spectral index above the peak depends on @xmath118 , and the spectral index @xmath119 of the radiation field that is responsible for ic cooling of electrons ; the spectral index for @xmath120 is @xmath121 which is harder than @xmath122 . as an application to swift j1644",

    "the theoretical light curves were calculated from a decelerating blastwave which had a fixed amount of total energy ( i.e. no late time injection of energy ) and yet the observed flux in these frequency bands is nearly flat for @xmath214days ( consistent with the observed data ) in spite of the fact that these bands clearly lie above the synchrotron injection ( @xmath215 ) and self - absorption ( @xmath22 ) frequencies ( shown in fig .",
    "4 ) . there is a noticeable dip in light curves between @xmath216 & 20 days .",
    "the reason for this dip is that the observed x - ray light curve during this period is nearly flat ( except , of course , for the ever present fluctuations ) .",
    "a flat x - ray light curve means that @xmath156 does not change much during this time interval ( see fig .",
    "however , @xmath215 and the peak flux ( which are independent of @xmath217 ) continue their monotonic decline , and that is the reason for the flux decrease during this period .",

    "the nearly flat light curves for @xmath214 days for 87 and 230 ghz is due to the fact that these bands lie above the synchrotron cooling frequency which rises very rapidly with time ( @xmath218 ) due to the rapidly declining x - ray flux ; we obtained this behavior analytically in the last section , and the numerical result is presented in fig .",
    "4 . the light curve remains nearly flat as long as the observing band is above @xmath156 , and then it starts to decline as @xmath219 .",
    "the duration of the flat phase is dictated by the temporal behavior of x - ray flux which we took for these calculations to decline as @xmath220 , and the spectrum was taken to be a power law function ; @xmath221 for @xmath222kev as per swift / xrt observations , at @xmath223 kev .",

    "the observed x - ray light curve in reality is much more complicated , and shows rapid fluctuations .",

    "a calculation of ic cooling of electrons , and the emergent flux , before 10 days must include these wild fluctuations for the result to be meaningful .",
    "the rise in light curves at lower frequencies ( 20 ghz or less ) and for @xmath236d is due to @xmath22 lying above the band ( see fig .",
    "this behavior can be understood using the analytical scalings presented in the last section .",
    "however , the error in the calculation of emergent light curves for frequencies @xmath237ghz is very large if the shell of shocked cnm is treated as homogeneous as we have done in this work .",
    "the reason is that fluctuations in @xmath39 lead to variation of synchrotron absorptivity with angular position and distance from the shock front ( due to the effect of x - rays on electron distribution function ) . and",
    "due to the exponential dependence of the emergent flux on the synchrotron optical depth along the photon trajectory , the error in theoretically calculated light curves is large when these variations are ignored . at sufficiently high frequencies , @xmath238ghz ,",
    "the optical depth is small and spatial variations of synchrotron absorption are averaged out , and therefore , treating the source as homogeneous is a fine approximation for the calculation of high frequency light curves .",
    "this is the reason we show light curves above about 50 ghz in fig . 3 , and not at lower frequencies .",
    "the solutions we are finding have @xmath239 , and that might naively suggest that the spectrum below @xmath22 should be @xmath240 in conflict with the observed spectrum of @xmath21 for @xmath241d . the fact that the observed spectrum is shallower than @xmath242 is already telling us that something is missing . and most likely what that is , is that the jet has some angular structure , and when integration over equal arrival time hyper - surface is carried out to obtain the observed spectrum , it turns out to be softer by @xmath243@xmath244 than the comoving , instantaneous , spectrum ) , @xmath97 , @xmath213 etc . for different points on the hypersurface",

    "the infrared flux at 10 days ( 0.03 mjy , levan et al . 2011 ) is roughly of order the theoretically calculated value for parameters used for fitting 230 ghz light curve shown in fig .",
    "the infrared producing electrons have @xmath245 and their ic cooling by scattering x - rays photons is highly suppressed due to k - n effect .",
    "however , @xmath156 due to synchrotron cooling is @xmath246hz , so the spectrum in this band should be @xmath247 if the emission is dominated by the external shock .",
    "levan et al . (",
    "2011 ) report that the infrared light curve declined with time as @xmath29 between 5 and 10 days .",
    "this is much too steep to be explained by external shock emission , and we suspect that this fall off suggests that ir radiation is produced by a process internal to the jet . the claim of 7.4@xmath2483.5 % linear polarization in the ir k@xmath249-band , at @xmath250days after the swift / bat trigger , by wiersema et al .",

    "the spectrum above the peak is quite hard , @xmath251 , even though @xmath215 and @xmath156 lie below the peak .",

    "fermi / lat upper limit restricts the cnm density at 10@xmath71 cm to be smaller than @xmath273@xmath70 ( see  [ lat - limit ] ) . and",
    "according to the radio / mm / infrared data the isotropic energy in the blast wave is @xmath274erg which is consistent with estimates obtained using equipartition argument , e.g. barniol duran et al .",
    "we note that the uncertainty in these parameters and @xmath149 is a factor of a few .",
    "it should be pointed out that the afterglow data we have used for determining energy etc .",
    "consists of observations carried out 10 or more days after the tde .",
    "the blast wave lorentz factor at this time had dropped to @xmath275 , and the angular size of the shocked cnm is perhaps larger by a factor @xmath276 than the jet angle at the smaller radius where x - rays were produced .",
    "thus , the beam corrected energy in the external shock is @xmath277erg . a more detailed discussion of beam corrected energy is provided at the end of this sub - section .",
    "we have also looked for the density stratification ( @xmath278 ) and find that @xmath279 provides a reasonable fit to the available data ; @xmath166 density stratification is expected for an advection dominated accretion flow in the neighborhood of a black hole , and @xmath233 is when outflow determines the cnm density structure .",

    "the perpendicular size of the system , @xmath297 , varies as @xmath298 , if the jet spreads sideways at the speed @xmath299 .",

    "5 is for @xmath280 .",
    "the energy in the external shock is smaller by a factor @xmath314 for a larger @xmath150 .",
    "so the isotropic energy shown in fig .",
    "5 should be divided by a factor @xmath216 ( if @xmath315 , which is very likely ) in order to obtain the true energy in j1644 + 57 as required by the radio / mm data .",
    "therefore , the total energy in the blast wave of j1644 + 57 is estimated to be of order @xmath7 erg which is consistent with the amount obtained independently from the x - ray data .      according to berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the synchrotron - absorption frequency ( @xmath22 ) dropped by a factor 10 between 5 and 10 days after the tidal disruption event sw j1655 + 57 .",
    "if these observations are correct has been overestimated by observers by a factor 23 . the spectrum reported by berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) at @xmath262d has no frequency coverage between 15 and 80 ghz .",
    "it is possible that the actual peak was at @xmath316ghz , in which case @xmath22 at 10d has been underestimated by a factor @xmath25 . ]",
    "then this result essentially rules out any shock model , with or without continuous energy injection , for radio emission unless some mechanism external to the shock led to a drastic change to the electron energy and magnetic fields in shocked plasma between 5 and 10 days . to understand this result",
    "we make use of equation ( [ nua1 ] ) for @xmath196 : @xmath317^{0.4 }     \\label{nua4}\\ ] ] where @xmath318 is the lorentz factor of electrons that have characteristic synchrotron frequency @xmath196 , and @xmath319 is the column density of electrons that radiate above @xmath196 .",
    "the right hand side of the first equation is proportional to the synchrotron flux at @xmath196 in the comoving frame of the source when synchrotron absorption is ignored , and in the second equation we have considered the case where @xmath320 ( other cases are straightforward to consider ) . for any external shock model , with or without energy injection and arbitrary cnm density stratification , @xmath137 , @xmath213 and @xmath321 are smooth functions of time ( see  3 ) .",
    "since @xmath322 ( eq . [ dyna1 ] ) , the most change we can expect for @xmath137 between 5 and 10 days is a factor @xmath323 for a @xmath324 medium ; similarly , @xmath325 can not change much during this time in the absence of an external agency at work . and",
    "@xmath321 , which depends on the number of electrons in the cnm swept up by the shock , is typically an increasing function of time and hence its effect on @xmath196 is to increase it . to increase .",
    "and when a shock suddenly encounters a zero density medium , the shocked plasma undergoes adiabatic expansion and then @xmath61 , @xmath213 , and @xmath326 decrease with time .",
    "it is easy to show that the net effect of adiabatic expansion is a slight decrease of @xmath22 in time interval @xmath226@xmath327 . ] we know empirically that @xmath328 decreased by a factor @xmath329 between 5 and 10 days for sw j1644 + 57 ( see fig . 2 of berger et al .",
    "2012 ) , and that by itself can only account for a decrease of @xmath22 by a factor @xmath275 .",
    "we see , therefore , that unless there is a dramatic change in @xmath213 and/or @xmath318 on a short time scale of @xmath330  which is not possible in external shocks without a powerful radiation front passing though it or some such mechanism  @xmath22 can not drop by a factor @xmath216 between 5 and 10 days that is observed for sw j1644 + 57 ; any addition of energy to a decelerating shock only makes the problem worse .",
    "it is probably no coincidence that the x - ray luminosity of sw j1644 + 57 fell by a factor @xmath17 during the same time period that @xmath22 dropped by a factor 10 . when a highly luminous x - ray front was passing through the external shock ( @xmath331d ) , electrons in the region",
    "were cooled by ic scatterings of x - rays to a lorentz factor of order unity in less than one dynamical time ( see eq .",
    "[ tic_tdy ] ) .",
    "the sharp drop in x - ray luminosity during 6 to 8 days by a factor 50 reduced the ic cooling of electrons and raised @xmath159 by the same factor . as we can see from equation ( [ nua4 ] ) a rising electron temperature helps to lower @xmath22 , however , the effect on @xmath332 is much smaller .",
    "ultimately , a sharp drop in @xmath213 is needed to account for the observed decrease of @xmath22 as can be seen from the second part of equation ( [ nua4 ] ) .",
    "we suspect that a sharp drop in @xmath217 leads to a smaller @xmath213 .",
    "one possible way this might occur is that while @xmath217 is large , or jet power is high , the interface separating the shocked jet and the shocked cnm is rayleigh - taylor unstable and the turbulence associated with this instability produces strong magnetic fields .",
    "currents driven in the shocked cnm by high @xmath217 might be another way to generate close to equipartition magnetic field in the region where radio / mm emission is produced .",
    "however , a connection between @xmath217 and magnetic field generation is just a speculation at this point indefinitely .",
    "the reason for this is that below a certain threshold x - ray luminosity magnetic field generation in external forward shock proceeds by weibel mechanism , or some other instability , that is not affected by @xmath217 . ] .",
    "an interesting puzzle is posed by the radio / mm data for the tidal disruption event swift j1644 + 57 : light curves in frequency bands that lie above the synchrotron characteristic peak frequencies , i.e. @xmath333 ghz , are roughly flat for @xmath32days rather than decline with time as @xmath31 as one would expect for radiation produced in the external shock .",
    "berger et al . ( 2012 ) suggested that the flat light curves are due to continued addition of energy to the external shock for 10@xmath27 days .",
    "this requires about 10 times more energy to be added at late times than is seen in x - rays , and that is worrisome .",
    "we have described in this paper a simple model for flat light curves that does not require adding any extra energy to the decelerating shock wave .",
    "the flat light curves , instead , are a result of efficient cooling of electrons in the external shock by ic scatterings of x - ray photons that pass through the external shock region on their way to us ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the ic cooling becomes weaker with time as the x - ray flux declines and that is the origin of radio / mm light curve flatness .",
    "this model can account for the radio and milli - meter data ( temporal decay as well as spectra ) , and is consistent with @xmath33410@xmath27mev upper limit provided by fermi / lat .",
    "the angular size of the x - ray beam should not be much smaller than the size of the external shock region during the initial @xmath6days for the ic cooling model to work ; otherwise only a fraction of shock accelerated electrons will be exposed to ic cooling , and the effect described here is weakened .",
    "the angular spreading of blast wave is discussed in  4.2 where it is shown that even at @xmath335d the angular size of the jet is no more than a factor 2 larger than its size at 10d .",
    "moreover , the decline of the late time radio / mm light curves as @xmath219 for @xmath336days ( zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ; fig .",
    "3 ) requires  in the framework of synchrotron radiation from a decelerating blast wave model  the angular spreading to be very weak ; the light curve decline for a sub - relativistic blast wave of a constant opening angle , for @xmath127 & @xmath233 , can be easily shown to be @xmath234 using formulae provided in  3.2 .",
    "in fact , considering the _ naturalness _ of this model  it is unavoidable that x - ray photons pass through the external shock and cool electrons  and its clear cut , robust , implications for external shock light curves , it is not unreasonable to conclude from the data for this tde that sideways spreading speed is at best modest for sub - relativistic blast waves as long as @xmath337 .",
    "the model predicts a connection between the observed x - ray light curve and the temporal and spectral properties of radio and mm radiation from sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "it requires more extensive numerical modeling than presented in this paper to explore this connection in detail , which can then be confronted with the extensive data for this remarkable event .",
    "barniol duran & piran ( 2013 ) have suggested two broad class of models for sw j1644 + 57 using equipartition arguments within the context of synchrotron emission , but without considering the ic cooling of electrons .",
    "the first scenario consists of one jet that is responsible for both the x - ray and the radio emission .",
    "the second scenario invokes two sources : a narrow relativistic jet to produce x - rays , and a quasi - spherical , mildly relativistic , source to produce the radio emission .",
    "both models require the energy available to electrons for synchrotron radiation to increase with time , but barniol duran & piran ( 2013 ) argue that the total energy in the radio source could be constant .",
    "the model suggested in the present work roughly corresponds to the first scenario , with a constant total energy , where the energy fraction available to electrons for synchrotron radiation increases with time as the x - ray luminosity decreases and the ic losses weaken .",
