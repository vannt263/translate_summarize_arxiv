    "<S> for example , a discrete group @xmath5 is amenable if and only if the full @xmath2-algebra @xmath6 is nuclear @xcite .    in a similar vein , for a discrete group @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> yu s property a is equivalent both to the nuclearity of the uniform roe algebra @xmath7 and to the exactness of the reduced @xmath2-algebra @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the results of anantharaman - delaroche and renault @xcite , higson and roe @xcite , guentner and kaminker @xcite , and ozawa @xcite . while property a and the uniform roe algebra can be defined for arbitrary metric spaces , we can not generalise these results without a good analogue of the reduced @xmath2-algebra of a group .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a @xmath2-algebra to fulfill this role . </S>",
    "<S> to do so we carry out the following programme . </S>",
    "<S> first we define the notion of a partial translation structure ( definition [ pt ] ) on a uniformly discrete metric space , which captures geometrically the interplay between the left and the right action of a group on itself . in broad terms , this can be described as follows . in euclidean space translations </S>",
    "<S> are distinguished from other isometries of the space by the fact that they move each point by the same distance . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that a group @xmath5 is equipped with a left invariant metric @xmath9 , which means that for any elements @xmath10 of @xmath5 , @xmath11 . in other words , multiplication on the left acts by isometries on the metric space @xmath12 . on the other hand , the right multiplication by a fixed element @xmath13 of @xmath5 moves each element @xmath14 of @xmath5 by the same distance : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the identity of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we say that the right multiplication acts by translations on @xmath17 even though these translations are not isometries in general . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an interesting connection between the translations arising from the right multiplication and the isometries given by the left multiplication . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is encoded in our definition of partial translation structure . </S>",
    "<S> it will follow directly from this definition that any group admits a canonical partial translation structure given by the left and right multiplication . </S>",
    "<S> this partial translation structure is in some sense the best possible , as discussed in section [ section3 ] . to measure how group - like is a given metric space @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a coarse invariant , a real valued function @xmath18 , associated to the space @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath19 for all @xmath20 we say that the partial translation structure is free .    </S>",
    "<S> next we construct a @xmath2-algebra , the partial translation algebra @xmath3 , associated to any partial translation structure @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a subalgebra of the uniform roe algebra @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the space @xmath1 is a group and @xmath0 is the canonical partial translation structure then @xmath3 is isomorphic to the reduced @xmath2-algebra of the group . </S>",
    "<S> we study the analytic properties of the partial translation algebras and we prove that when the space admits a free , globally controlled partial translation structure @xmath0 then the following are equivalent ( theorem [ main ] ) :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 has property @xmath21 ; 2 .   </S>",

    "<S> this is related to a theorem of skandalis , tu and yu , @xcite , who proved the equivalence of 1 and 4 for bounded geometry metric spaces .    in theorem [ ptforgroups ] we prove the following . </S>",
    "<S> when the space @xmath1 admits an injective uniform embedding into a group , one can pull back the canonical partial translation structure from the group to the space to obtain a free partial translation structure on @xmath1 which satisfies the hypotheses of the above theorem [ main ] . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude furthermore that @xmath19 for all @xmath22 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if @xmath23 for some @xmath22 , then @xmath1 does not admit an injective uniform embedding into any countable group . </S>",
    "<S> our invariant therefore provides an obstruction to the existence of such an embedding ( corollary [ cor20 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of the existence of a uniform embedding in a group can be treated locally . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the notion of a local embedding in a group and show that a discrete metric space @xmath1 is embeddable in a group if and only if it is locally embeddable ( theorem [ localue ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main interest in this notion comes from the existence of a space @xmath24 with the universal property that every bounded geometry space locally uniformly embeds in @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore able to show that @xmath24 embeds uniformly in a countable discrete group @xmath5 if and only if for each uniformly discrete bounded geometry metric space @xmath1 there is a countable discrete group @xmath25 such that @xmath1 uniformly embeds in @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that property a of a metric space @xmath1 is a coarse invariant , but the uniform roe algebra @xmath4 is not . </S>",
