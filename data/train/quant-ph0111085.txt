    "@xcite such devices were called state - dependent cloners. writers of @xcite introduced the notion of global fidelity and constructed the optimal symmetric state - dependent cloner which optimizes the global fidelity .",

    "( note that pointed works also concern another questions . )",
    "the universal copying machines , producing multiple copies , were considered in papers @xcite .    of course , the evaluation of copying quality is dependent on the used measure of closeness to ideality .",
    "measure used by hillery and buek can be named absolute error of copying of two - state set . in work",
    "@xcite the global fidelity was maximized and the optimal symmetric state - dependent cloner was constructed .",
    "thus , the state - dependent cloning was mostly examined from the global fidelity viewpoint . however , the state - dependent cloning is a complex subject with many facets .",
    "important as the notion of the global fidelity is , it does not cover the problem on the whole . in paper",
    "@xcite author proposed and motived the notion of the relative error for @xmath6 state - dependent cloning .",
