    "quasar absorption lines have been used as probes of the high - redshift universe for some time ( e.g. sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) , since the ly@xmath0  ( 1216 ) transition is redshifted into the optical at @xmath2 .",
    "hires ( vogt et al . 1994 ) on the keck 10 m telescope has been at the forefront in providing high s / n , high resolution quasar spectra that has enabled dramatic advances in our understanding of the high - redshift intergalactic medium ( rauch 1998 ) .",
    "conversely , studies of low - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers require ultraviolet spectroscopy , which has only recently become routinely possible with the _ hubble space telescope_. the hst quasar aborption line key project ( bahcall et al .",
    "1993 ) observed over 80 quasars using the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , and found a surprisingly large number of absorbers as compared to an extrapolation from high - redshift ( bahcall et al .",
    "1996 ; weymann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "recently the deployment of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) has provided a dramatic increase in resolving power ( resolution @xmath3 as opposed to fos s @xmath4 ) , thereby fully resolving all ly@xmath0  absorbers seen in uv quasar spectra . while only the brightest quasars and agn may be easily observed with stis , this has still resulted in significant gains in our understanding of low - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers and their relation to high - redshift absorbers . in these proceedings",
    "i report some recent results from hst / stis .    in conjunction with these observations , hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation in currently favored cosmological scenarios",
    "have elucidated a new paradigm for the nature of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers , particularly at high redshift .",
    "these simulations indicate that ly@xmath0  absorbers arise in highly photoionized diffuse intergalactic gas tracing the dark matter in non - equilibrium large - scale structures .",
    "their temperature is set by a balance between photoioinization heating from a metagalactic uv background ( presumably from quasars ; haardt & madau 1996 ) and adiabatic cooling due to hubble expansion , resulting in a tight relation @xmath5 .",
    "these simulations are able to reproduce various statistical properties of high - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers in detail , spanning the range of damped ly@xmath0  systems to the weakest observed detected with hires , all within a model that generically arises in cdm cosmologies ( hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; dav et al .",
    "figure  1 shows a comparison of a portion of the hires spectrum of q1422 + 231 ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) with a simulated spectrum covering the same redshift interval , having resolution and noise properties that emulate the data .",
    "can you tell which is which ?",
    "( answer at the end ) .    due to the relatively simple relationship between and the underlying dark matter , a formula known as the  fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation \" ( fgpa ;",
    "see croft et al .",
    "1998 for full formula ) provides a remarkably accurate description of ly@xmath0  absorbing gas : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the optical depth , @xmath8 is the density of dark matter ( or baryons ) , and @xmath9 is the metagalactic photoionization rate incident on the absorber .",
    "the fgpa has been combined with hires quasar spectra to provide stringent constraints on many aspects of the physics of high - redshift intergalactic gas . for instance , a measurement of the mean optical depth together with an independent estimate of @xmath9 result in a robust estimate of @xmath10 ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , in good agreement with d / h measurements ( burles & tytler 1998 ) and recent cmb analyses ( e.g. pryke et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the fgpa also implies that a given ly@xmath0  optical depth ( or flux , in the optically - thin regime ) corresponds to a particular density of gas at a particular temperature .",
    "hence ionization corrections can be accurately obtained to constrain the metallicity of the diffuse high - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) from metal - line observations of ( songaila & cowie 1996 ; rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz 1997 ; dav et al .",
    "these studies found [ c / h]@xmath11 for a haardt & madau ( 1996 ) ionizing background shape , and significantly lower for a spectrum with fewer high - energy photons ( as would be expected if helium had not yet reionized ; see heap et al .",
    "furthermore , recent vlt / uves observations of absorption suggests the presence of some metals even in voids ( schaye et al .",
    "2000 ) , presenting a significant theoretical challenge to models of metal ejection and transport in the igm ( e.g. aguirre et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the most ambitious use of the fgpa , and the one for which it was originally developed , is a reconstruction of the matter power spectrum at @xmath12 from keck / hires quasar spectra .",
    "since the optical depth in the ly@xmath0  forest traces the matter density , fluctuations in the optical depth reflect a 1-d probe of the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum , at scales of @xmath13 ( comoving ) . for a flat universe , this measurement yields a constraint on the matter density of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the power spectrum shape parameter ( croft et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this value is slightly higher that in the  concordance model \" ( @xmath16 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the latest cmb measurements combined with the @xmath17 key project value ( mould et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest a higher @xmath18 as well ( pryke et al .",
    "2001 ) . thus the ly@xmath0  forest provides an independent avenue for doing  precision cosmology \" , alongside cmb , type ia supernovae , etc",
    "recently , hydrodynamic simulations have been evolved to redshift zero to investigate the nature of low - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers and the evolution of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "they indicate that while many of the baryons have moved into galaxies , clusters , and a diffuse shocked  warm - hot intergalactic medium \" ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ) , roughly one - third of all baryons continue to reside in photoionized gas tracing large - scale structure .",
    "these simulations are able to explain a wide range of key project observations quite naturally within the context of hierarchical structure formation scenarios .",
    "for instance , the key project data showed that high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) ly@xmath0  absorbers are evolving away quite rapidly , whereas for @xmath19 the absorber number density evolution slows abruptly and dramatically ( bahcall et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the simulations of dav",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) and theuns et al . (",
    "1998 ) , this occurs due to the dimunition of the quasar population providing the metagalactic photoionizing flux . as a result , the rapid evolution of absorbers due to hubble expansion in the high-@xmath20 universe is countered by the increase in neutral fraction of ly@xmath0  absorbing gas at @xmath21 .",
    "these simulations disfavor a scenario in which a different population of absorbers dominates at low redshift as compared to high redshift , and instead suggest that the nature of absorbing gas is quite similar .",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that stronger absorbers disappear more rapidly than weaker absorbers , and in fact the weakest absorbers seen in the fos sample ( rest equivalent width @xmath22 ) show an _ increase _ in number between @xmath23 .",
    "dav et al .",
    "suggested that this arose due to differential hubble expansion , in particular that low - density regions expand faster than high - density ones and therefore provide an increasing fractional cross - section of absorption to lower redshifts .",
    "motivated by the good agreement between simulations and fos observations , dav et al .",
    "investigated the physical state of the gas giving rise to ly@xmath0  absorption at low redshift .",
    "they found that the gas follows similar physical relationships as deduced at high - redshift , and is thus of the same basic character , but that a given column density absorber corresponds to different physical densities at different redshifts .",
    "this effect is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the top left panel shows the density - column density relation at @xmath24 from a @xmath25cdm simulation .",
    "the tight relation reflects the accuracy of the fgpa ; much of the scatter about the best - fit relation ( solid line ) comes from errors in voigt profile fitting ( noise with s / n=30 was added to the artificial spectra to roughly match observations ) . at low redshift , the relationship persists , though there is more scatter due to the presence of absorbers arising in shock - heated intergalactic gas ( dav et al . 1999 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the best - fit slope of the @xmath26 relation is similar , but the amplitude has shifted considerably from @xmath27 . this shift arises because of the interplay between hubble expansion and the evolution of the ionizing background .    the bottom panel of figure  2 focusses on the evolution of this trend with redshift . here , we show the typical column density of an absorber arising in gas with three different densities , as a function of redshift . for instance , gas at the mean density ( which typically remains around that density over a hubble time ) produces a strong absorber of @xmath28 atr @xmath24 , but by @xmath29 it produces only a very weak absorber of @xmath30 . in general , a given density corresponds to a column density @xmath31 lower at @xmath29 as compared to @xmath24 . thus studying physically and dynamically equivalent absorbers at",
    "high and low redshift requires comparing across different column densities .    using this trend",
    ", the knowledge and intuition gained from studies of the ly@xmath0  forest at high redshift can be translated to expectations at low redshift . for instance , it is known that most absorbers with @xmath32 at @xmath12 are enriched ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) ; thus one expects that absorbers with @xmath33 should be enriched to at least a similar level ( though detecting these metal lines will be challenging ) .",
    "a new window on the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest has opened with the deployment of stis aboard hst .",
    "stis s e140",
    "m echelle grating provides @xmath34 resolution , a level of detail comparable to hires albeit with somewhat more noise .",
    "stis can thus probe weak forest absorbers that are predicted to be physically similar to those at high - redshift , and allows a detailed comparison to be made with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "dave & tripp ( 2001 ) compared the quasar spectra of pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 to carefully - constructed artificial spectra drawn from a @xmath25cdm simulation .",
    "the statistical properties of absorbers in the simulations were in remarkable agreement with observations , as shown in figure  3 .",
    "the column density distributions agree down to the smallest observable absorbers , in both slope and amplitude .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the column density distribution ( from @xmath35 ) is measured to be @xmath36 , which is considerably steeper than at high redshift ( @xmath37 ; kim et al .",
    "this indicates , in agreement with weymann et al . , that stronger absorbers have evolved away faster than weaker ones .",
    "our result is also in broad agreement ( @xmath38 higher ) with penton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found @xmath39 from ghrs data .",
    "the distribution of line widths ( @xmath40-parameters ) is also in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the median @xmath40-parameter is around @xmath41 , but this value is sensitive to the column density detection threshold , because the column density and @xmath40-parameter are correlated .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that higher column density systems arise in higher density gas that has higher temperature .",
    "since thermal broadening contributes significantly to line widths ( compare the dotted and dashed lines in the right panel of figure  3 ) , higher column density absorbers will tend to have larger widths .",
    "thus shull et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who find a median @xmath40-parameter of @xmath42 from fuse and ghrs data , are not in disagreement with our result because their sample has a higher column density detection limit .",
    "the large thermal component of linewidths facilitates a measurement of the typical temperature of ly@xmath0  absorbing gas at low redshift . by comparing the observed median @xmath40-parameter to simulations ,",
    "dav & tripp found that purely photoionized ly@xmath0  absorbers ( those that have not been shock - heated ) at the mean density have a temperature of @xmath43k , in agreement with ricotti , gnedin & shull ( 2000 ) .",
    "the agreement in amplitude of the column density distribution can be translated into a constraint on the photoionization rate @xmath9 , since varying @xmath9 would shift the simulated column density distribution proportionally in the horizontal direction ( assuming optically thin lines , which is valid for most stis absorbers ) .",
    "dav & tripp obtain @xmath44 , with the errors dominated by systematic uncertainties in modeling , providing among the most precise constraints on the metagalactic @xmath9 to date .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest has proved to be a powerful tool for constraining a wide variety of physical and cosmological parameters , when hydrodynamic simulations and the fgpa are used in conjunction with high - resolution quasar spectra .",
    "much progress has already been made at high redshift , where the metallicity , ionization state , and mass fluctuation spectrum have all been derived from ly@xmath0  forest data .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation also provide an excellent description of low redshift ly@xmath0  forest absorbers , particularly for the weak absorbers that reside in moderate - overdensity regions analogous to high - redshift absorers .",
    "hst / stis has opened up a new era in the study of the low - redshift igm , which promises to progress considerably further with the deployment of the cosmic origins spectrogaph aboard hst ( in 2003 ) .",
    "initial results indicate that the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest can yield important constraints on physical parameters in the igm , as well as provide a more complete picture of the evolution of baryons in the universe .",
