    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) owes its confining property to non - perturbative structures of its groundstate which are , after many years of research , not yet uniquely identified .",
    "( for a recent overview of competing pictures see e.g. @xcite ) . in a more pragmatic attitude , the stochastic vacuum model ( svm ) @xcite describes the vacuum structure in terms of a few vacuum correlation functions and points out which are related to confinement . that only few correlators should characterize",
    "the vacuum is the consequence of a truncation of the hierarchy of correlation functions , essentially due to a postulate made within the svm that the gauge fields are gaussian random processes in euclidean space - time . in this framework ,",
    "the correlators enter , and relate to each other , various phenomenological predictions . particularly interesting",
    "( exhausting , in the case of pure gluodynamics ) is the gauge invariant gluon field strength correlator in euclidean space ( and its continuation to minkowski space ) . according to the svm , part of the euclidean field strength correlator at zero temperature",
    "is related to the confinement property of the qcd ground state @xcite . for heavy quarkonium states ,",
    "the full correlator describes the effect of the gluon condensate on the level splitting in detail ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "wick - rotated to minkowski space , the correlator serves to parametrize high energy hadron - hadron scattering ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "regardless of how this truncation exactly works , these correlators incorporate the unknown non - perturbative mechanisms and can be considered as an implicit parametrization of the important gluonic vacuum field modes .",
    "if they were known , this information could be readily used to constrain the parameters of more explicit models of vacuum structure .",
    "the central role , both theoretically and phenomenologically , strongly suggests to extract the field strength correlator ( and other vacuum correlators ) from a first principle lattice simulation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , although the svm approach has been proposed more than a decade ago by dosch and simonov @xcite , on the lattice the field strength correlator has only been studied by the pisa group . apart from earlier results for @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite pure gauge theory , there are now precise results available , from an analysis using cooling , over an interval of distances 0.1 ... 1.0 fm for pure @xmath2 gluodynamics @xcite , for qcd with dynamical ( kogut - susskind ) fermions @xcite ( four flavors , for two values of mass ) over an interval 0.4 ... 1.0 fm , and , over the same interval of distances , for pure @xmath2 yang - mills theory very near the deconfining temperature @xcite .    lattice data for @xmath3 obtained and fitted in refs . @xcite",
    "give strong hints in favor of dominance of locally selfdual or antiselfdual field strengths .",
    "these data have been analyzed @xcite from the point of view of the random instanton liquid model @xcite . here",
    "the following picture arises : a rather dilute liquid of instantons ( with parameters which , in the case of full qcd , happen to be roughly consistent with parameters obtained from phenomenological analyses ) can explain the field strength correlator , including the part which is believed to be responsible for confinement .",
    "the relevance of this statement for confinement is far from clear .",
    "absolute confinement is , strictly speaking , a property of pure yang - mills theory alone . at this place",
    "let us mention that a much higher instanton density is extracted from the field strength correlator in the case of pure yang - mills theory than for full qcd @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", according to a widespread opinion a random instanton liquid , however dense it might be , does not lead to an asymptotic string tension .",
    "this is obvious for calculations of the direct effect of the ( unperturbed ) instanton liquid on the static @xmath4-@xmath5 potential via the wilson loop .",
    "while the instanton potential rises linearly at intermediate distance , this does not correspond to the known string tension @xcite if the phenomenological density and size are assumed to hold .",
    "let us note , however , that neither instanton suppression by external charges or fields nor instanton interactions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) have been taken into account in these estimates .",
    "it has even been questioned @xcite whether the available lattice evidence for confinement is conclusive at all . in short , in spite of the possibility of an instanton interpretation of the correlator , the role of instantons for confinement is still controversial .",
    "the answer depends on details of the modeling of the instanton liquid , in particular on the density and the shape of size distribution ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    there is an indirect route ( not completely worked out yet ) leading from the instanton liquid to confinement .",
    "it has been demonstrated that under certain circumstances an instanton liquid induces the condensation ( percolation ) of magnetic monopoles ( see ref.@xcite and earlier references therein ) which should confine via a dual meissner effect .",
    "a corresponding effective theory of a dual abelian gauge field , interacting minimally with the ( condensed ) monopole field ( dual abelian higgs model @xcite ) is characterized by the mass of the dual `` photon '' and a finite higgs correlation length . both quantities together determine @xcite the gauge invariant non - abelian field strength correlator which we are interested in .",
    "therefore , in a more fundamental way , the two structure functions of the correlator at @xmath3 are inherent to an infrared effective dual formulation of qcd ( see also @xcite ) .    similarly to @xmath3 the field strength correlator at finite temperature encodes information on generic non - perturbative structures of non - abelian gauge field histories dominating the qcd partition function . in a similar spirit as of ref .",
    "@xcite , the correlators obtained near the deconfinement transition in pure @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite have been analyzed from the caloron ( finite @xmath6 instanton ) point of view @xcite .",
    "such a description turns out to be possible only below the deconfinement temperature @xmath7 .    as any measurement involving the field strength ,",
    "such lattice calculations are far from trivial .",
    "the cooling method has been used in most of the more recent studies . to our opinion ,",
    "the implications of this method for the intended measurements have not been discussed thoroughly enough so far . in this paper",
    ", we are going to apply a different technique to improve the signal for extracting the field strength correlator from lattice gauge field ensembles .",
    "our method is based on a ( classically ) perfect action and uses a renormalization group motivated smoothing procedure @xcite .",
    "we shall give a presentation of first results obtained in this manner for finite temperature @xmath0 pure gauge theory .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3 , a similar splitting of correlation lengths related to the different structure functions is obtained with both techniques .",
    "some possible differences should be closer examined whether they are due to the other gauge group @xmath0 used here , compared to @xmath2 analyzed with cooling .",
    "if not then , cooling would have a systematic effect concerning the relative strength of the structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 at high temperature .",

    "in this case we will separate the data into @xmath8 and @xmath9 afterwards , using the obtained form of the fit .",
    "it should be emphasized already here that , due to our smoothing method , these functions are obtained essentially free of a perturbative contribution .",
    "the pisa group @xcite has used the cooling method in order to measure the field strength correlators at @xmath3 , both without external sources ( in vacuum ) and in the presence of an external wilson loop @xcite , and at temperature near @xmath7 . for the measurement ,",
    "similar to the search for instantons , it turned out necessary to eliminate ultraviolet fluctuations .",
    "it has been argued that , due to the diffusive nature of cooling , the correlator to be measured at a distance @xmath81 ( @xmath82 lattice spacing ) would not be affected before a number @xmath83 of cooling iterations would have been performed . practically , one measures the expectation values defining @xmath84 and @xmath85 as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "the actual correlator is then defined as the plateau value _ vs. _ @xmath86 .",
    "although it has not been presented in detail , experience seems to justify the expectation that this plateau is reached safely before @xmath87 happens to fall within the diffusion radius @xmath88 . in another context",
    "it has been shown that this amount of cooling amounts to a renormalization of coupling , which is expected to show up in the perturbative signal contributing to the correlator .",
    "if cooling is technically necessary to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , one could be concerned to what extent it distorts the non - perturbative modes that existed in the true vacuum , i.e. , to what extent the correlation lengths and the strength of the correlators are affected by the procedure itself . since the ( exponential ) correlation length of the correlator @xmath8 is even smaller than the phenomenological instanton size it is useful to recall what effect cooling has in the attempt to fix instanton size and density from analyzing the topological density of a configuration . for this purpose ,",
    "the cooling technique nowadays is superseded by adopting two , essentially opposite extreme ways to control that effect .",
    "the first prescription requires to observe the average size as function of @xmath86 , extrapolating it backward to zero cooling steps @xcite in order to obtain the would - be instanton size in vacuum .",
    "the other uses a global stopping criterion @xcite requiring cooling to be stopped when the density of instantons becomes equal to the ( much better known ! ) topological susceptibility .",
    "this second method implicitly adopts a non - interacting instanton gas picture , which differs principally from the instanton liquid .",
    "it is recognized by now that one has to control cooling since instantons , once they become discernible by cooling or smearing , are steadily growing , becoming more and more classical , while small size instanton - antiinstanton pairs annihilate .",
    "improved cooling @xcite aims to stabilize instantons with @xmath89 , still suffering from the latter problem . presently , there is no method agreed upon , such that the instanton size can not be uniquely defined on the lattice @xcite .",
    "each of the methods seems to have a smoothing radius of the lattice fields ( depending on @xmath86 ) which should be well below the distances at which one measures the correlator .    during the last two years",
    "a method has been advocated @xcite that avoids propagating , iterative procedures to suppress uv fluctuations .",
    "alternatively , it uses first blocking and subsequent inverse blocking with respect to a perfect action in order to accomplish the necessary smoothing of equilibrium configurations , while it preserves their long range structure beyond the smoothing scale .",
    "so far , this method has been used exclusively to analyze the instanton @xcite and monopole structure @xcite of monte carlo generated configurations . as for monopoles , smoothing wipes out small monopole loops which are irrelevant for confinement ( similar to blockspin renormalizations directly applied to the magnetic currents @xcite ) .      to carry out a theoretically and technically consistent analysis",
    ", one has to implement a fixed point ( fp ) action .",
    "the simplified fixed - point action @xcite for @xmath0 has been improved recently , and a suitably truncated version @xcite has been obtained .",
    "it is also parametrized in terms of only two types of wilson loops , plaquettes ( type @xmath90 ) @xmath91 and tilted @xmath92-dimensional @xmath93-link loops ( type @xmath94 ) of the form @xmath95 and contains several powers of the linear action terms corresponding to each loop ( of both types ) that can be drawn on the lattice @xmath96 the parameters of this action as used in this work are reproduced in table i. a comparison reported in detail in @xcite shows that the new parametrization is near to perfect .    with this action at hand",
    "one can now proceed to perform renormalization group transformations on the lattice .",
    "suppose we have a fine lattice of links @xmath97 and a coarse lattice of links @xmath98 covering the same physical volume .",
    "being a classically perfect action , @xmath99 can be evaluated on both lattices and must satisfy the following condition @xmath100 configuration by configuration over a representative ensemble of equilibrium gauge field configurations @xmath98 , each in one - to - one correspondence to a fine configuration @xmath97 saturating the lower bound on @xmath101 provided by the right hand side .",

    "we find still @xmath156 fm . immediately above the deconfining transition ( at @xmath157 )",
    "it has dropped already to @xmath158 fm .",
    "for the purpose of the fit shown in fig . 1 , we assumed all four functions to have a form like @xmath159 and required the same limit for @xmath160 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as well as for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in addition to this , have we considered remaining perturbative contributions to these four functions being proportional to @xmath161 .",
    "for all temperatures and all correlation functions we found this contribution to be smaller than the signal by one or two orders of magnitude over the range of distances from 1 to 6 lattice spacings .",
    "of course , also here only correlator data at distances @xmath143 have been included into the fit . in the following we therefor only discuss parameters which were determined by fits neglecting such a power - like perturbative contribution .",
    "the parameters @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 are listed in table iii in lattice units . in the confinement phase",
    ", the coefficient @xmath164 is relatively important only for @xmath165 and @xmath166 . while it remains roughly unchanged also at higher temperature for the magnetic correlator , it rises dramatically in the electric case in order to account for the rapid decay .",
    "on the basis of this fit , we have determined the structure functions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 which are shown in fig . 2 for all @xmath32 values .",
    "in a first step the @xmath62 have been numerically obtained by integrating the difference @xmath167 ( as represented by the fits ) from @xmath168 to @xmath169 .",
    "the integration constants @xmath170 are fixed by the condition that @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "we find the functions @xmath62 positive .",
    "finally , the @xmath61 have been obtained subtracting @xmath62 from @xmath173 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ( which are related to the gluon condensate at high temperature ) and the integrated correlation lengths of @xmath73 and @xmath75 , @xmath178 , are given in table iv for the six temperatures .",
    "as long as @xmath179 the functions @xmath62 are smaller by roughly a factor four than the corresponding @xmath61 .",
    "that means that selfdual or antiselfdual fields are less dominant in this range of temperatures compared to zero temperature .",
    "the ratio @xmath180 has been found @xcite considerably smaller below the deconfinement transition in an analysis of @xmath2 correlators obtained with cooling .",
    "since there are no cooling data for @xmath0 so far in our temperature range , we can not decide whether this is due to the other gauge group or whether there is a systematic effect of cooling to enhance the contribution of locally ( anti)selfdual configurations to the correlator at higher temperature but still in the confined phase .",
    "the condensates @xmath174 and @xmath176 only slightly grow across the transition and start to rapidly grow not before @xmath181 . up to these temperatures",
    "the @xmath182 have increased to a size comparable with @xmath170 .",
    "the integrated correlation lengths of @xmath61 shrink in a rather continuous way over the temperature range considered from 0.3 fm ( electric and magnetic ) at @xmath183 to 0.13 fm ( magnetic ) and 0.07 fm ( electric ) at @xmath184 ( fig .",
    "the smooth change of the four structure functions with increasing temperature is shown in fig .",
    "at first , we find our data approximately @xmath17 rotational invariant also at @xmath185 as long we consider the confinement phase . the small difference between the corresponding electric and magnetic correlators ( both for @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) probably can be attributed to overlapping fields of ( anti)calorons , within a small density expansion .",
    "this picture , however , breaks down in the deconfined phase . in the confinement phase ,",
    "the correlator @xmath188 practically coincides with @xmath189 ( see fig . 1 and note there the upward shift by a factor two in the latter ) . at the transition ,",
    "the breakdown of @xmath188 ( in the correlation length ) is the most notable result of our analysis .    comparing the two methods of fitting we find that the condensates estimated from the constrained , purely exponential fits in terms of two structure functions @xmath73 and @xmath190 tend to be bigger than the condensates from the second fit .",
    "this is because the latter better accounts for the real shape of the correlators near zero distance .",
    "the exponential fit also does not properly describe the correlator @xmath145 at large distances .",
    "this observation holds for all temperatures . within the deconfined phase",
    ", the @xmath140 correlators can not be described at all , by an ansatz in terms of exponential @xmath73 and @xmath190 functions .",
    "thus , the rapid change of the exponential correlation lengths ( in particular , of the electric correlation length ) at the transition merely reflects the difficulty to reach a constrained fit within these assumptions .",
    "the gauss - exponential fit proves to be much more robust over the whole range of temperatures . without any further assumptions concerning the shape of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "such a fit gives access to these functions which indeed seem to be poorly described by exponentials .",
    "we have to describe them by integrated correlation lengths which can not be directly compared with the exponential correlation lengths of the supposedly exponential fits . in general",
    ", the integrated correlation lengths turn out to be bigger than the exponential ones .    in contrast to the exponential correlation lengths of the constrained exponential fits , the integrated correlation lengths associated to the correlation functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as reconstructed from the second fit , change rather smoothly . as the result of these smooth changes with temperature ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath188 drops ( in correlation length ) at the deconfinement transition .",
    "the reconstruction of the absolute size of @xmath8 and @xmath9 structure functions ( condensates ) from the fits of @xmath186 and @xmath187 becomes increasingly difficult at higher and higher temperature . below the deconfinement temperature and even near to @xmath7 as a characteristic feature of the data ,",
    "it is well - recognized , that the @xmath9 part of the electric and the magnetic correlator is considerably smaller than the @xmath8 part .",
    "the dominance of ( anti)selfdual fields , however , associated with this observation is already weaker in our present results , at temperatures below the transition , than it has been found for zero temperature .",
    "it is also weaker than what has been found analyzing cooling data for quenched @xmath2 near the deconfinement temperature . in table v this statement can be checked for the so - called non - abelianicity of the magnetic correlator .",
    "it is roughly 80 % at @xmath183 and drops to than 70 % at @xmath7 . in the deconfined phase @xmath191",
    "amounts to approximately 50 % , with an increasing uncertainty .",
    "the positivity of magnetic and electric @xmath9 is a clear feature of the data .",
    "this applies to the correlators obtained in this work by smoothing as well as to the measurements using the cooling method ( for quenched @xmath2 ) . within a caloron analysis ( which successfully works only below @xmath7 for the @xmath2 cooling data )",
    "there is no compelling reason to have @xmath47 .",
    "this is unlike the instanton liquid description for @xmath3 .",
    "a caloron analysis of the present data will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the sum of @xmath192 and @xmath193 is given by the extrapolation to zero distance of both @xmath186 and @xmath187 for the electric and magnetic correlators .",
    "this quantity is known without big uncertainty and is also presented in table v in physical units for the six temperatures . the behavior of condensates and correlation lengths is sketched graphically across and beyond the deconfinement transition in fig .",
    "quantitatively , the correlation lengths are not very different from the results of the cooling method , applied on @xmath2 configurations .    the present work dealt with @xmath0 pure gauge theory instead of the phenomenologically more interesting case of @xmath2 .",
    "however it has shown an interesting pattern of temperature dependence of the magnetic and electric correlation lengths related to the different structure functions .",
    "while the basic structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 change smoothly across the phase transition , the most dramatic effect , the breakdown of @xmath165 , results from the interplay . a simple picture according to which @xmath73 would turn to zero in the deconfined phase is not corroborated by our data",
    ".    it seems to be worthwhile to investigate the field strength correlators for @xmath194 using the cooling method , too , in order to compare it with the smoothing method applied here",
    ". it would be even more interesting to implement the rg smoothing method for the gauge group @xmath2 .",
    "this would then allow for a direct comparison with the pioneering results already available thanks to the pisa group .",
