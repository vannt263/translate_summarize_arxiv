    "measurements of the low - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) are critical to our understanding of the large scale structure and ionization state of the local universe as well as the interaction of galaxies with their environment .",
    "fuse is ideally suited to measure intergalactic hi absorption up to @xmath3 , ovi to @xmath4 , and ciii to @xmath5 .",
    "we started with published lists of intervening ly@xmath1 absorption systems toward low-@xmath0 agns , obtained from ghrs and stis surveys by @xcite .",
    "other sight lines were covered by literature sources or measured at the university of colorado from stis / e140 m spectra .",
    "we disregarded any weak ly@xmath1 absorbers ( w@xmath6 m , logn(hi)@xmath7 ) and searched the fuse data for higher - order lyman lines , ovi , and ciii counterparts .",
    "we measured all available lyman series lines to determine n and @xmath8 values for hi via curves of growth .",
    "metal - ion columns were determined via profile fits ; we assume that any saturation in these lines will be mild , and that profile fits accurately determine the column density .",
    "we measured 167 absorbers with w@xmath9(ly@xmath1)@xmath10 m  toward 26 agn sight lines .",
    "of these absorbers , 126 were at @xmath4 with 52 ovi 3@xmath11 detections in one or both lines of the doublet and 63 well - defined upper limits .",
    "the ovi lines for the remaining 11 absorbers fall on top of airglow lines , strong ism lines , or are in some other way inaccessible . for absorbers where both lines of the ovi doublet were measured",
    ", we calculated a weighted mean for n(ovi ) .",
    "we find that the differential number @xmath12 of ovi absorbers detected with column density n@xmath13 is consistent with a power law with index @xmath14 : @xmath15 .",
    "this is much steeper than the equivalent power - law relationship for hi : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "ovi is an ideal tracer ( at @xmath17 k ) for the warm - hot ionized medium ( whim ; @xmath18 k ) while hi composes the bulk of the warm neutral medium ( wnm ; @xmath19 k ) .",
    "n(ovi ) shows a mild correlation with n(hi ) in the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "while n(hi ) varies by nearly 3 orders of magnitude , n(ovi ) is detected between @xmath20 to a few times @xmath21 @xmath22 ( a factor of @xmath2330 ) .",
    "the _ `` multiphase ratio '' _",
    "n(hi)/n(ovi ) shown in the right panel of figure  1 exhibits a moderate correlation with a dispersion of roughly one dex .",
    "the large range in n(hi ) and correlation in multiphase ratio imply that the igm has at least two phases ( whim and wnm ) .",
    "we suggest that the warmer phase occupies a shell around a colder , neutral core of arbitrary size .",
    "the outer whim shell is heated by a combination of external ionizing photons ( from qsos ) and shocks from infalling clouds .",
    "the narrow range of n(ovi ) compared to n(hi ) implies that the whim shell may have a characteristic size , while the neutral core can be arbitrarily large .",
    "using ovi as a tracer of the @xmath2 k portion of the whim , we can employ the number of absorbers per unit redshift to determine @xmath24 , the fraction of the universe s critical density made up by whim gas .",
    "our detection statistics are shown in table  1 and figure  2 for hi and ovi .",
    "we estimate that our ovi survey is complete down to 30 m  in the 1032   line ( logn(ovi)@xmath2313.4 ) yielding 37 absorbers .",
    "the total path length surveyed in the 26 sight lines is @xmath25 for a d@xmath12/d@xmath26 .",
    "we assume h@xmath27=70 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 , an o to h abundance of 10% of the solar value ( @xmath29 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2001 ) , and an ionic fraction ( ovi / o)=0.2 @xcite . using the equations in @xcite , we get @xmath30 .",
    "uncertainties are based on poisson statistics of @xmath31 absorbers .",
    "it should be noted that this is a lower limit and the value is likely to go up as we refine our redshift pathlength values and take into account the incomplete sample of 15 absorbers with logn(ovi)@xmath3213.4 .",
    "our result is entirely consistent with the result published by @xcite of @xmath33 based on only six ovi absorbers ; our survey has six times more absorbers .",
    "a similar study by @xcite based on 44 higher - redshift ovi absorbers ( @xmath34 ) finds @xmath35 .",
    "our value gives @xmath36 and shows that whim gas in the @xmath2 k range makes up at least 5% of the baryonic mass in the local universe ."
