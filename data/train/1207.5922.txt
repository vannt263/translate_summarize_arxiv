    "the quarkonia , especially the bottomonium @xmath1 states , are approximately non - relativistic systems since they do not contain intrinsically relativistic light quarks .",
    "hence , these states are the best candidates to examine the hadronic dynamics and investigate both perturbative and non - perturbative characteristic of qcd . in the past ,",
    "mainly theoretical calculations on the properties of these states had been made using potential model or its extensions like the coulomb gauge model ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , both potential model and qcd sum rule approach have been applied to extract the ground - state decay constant of mesons containing heavy b quark .",
    "it is stated that the qcd sum rule technique gives more reliable and accurate determination of bound - state characteristics compared to the potential models by tunning the continuum threshold parameter .",
    "the qcd sum rule approach @xcite is one of the most powerful and applicable tools to hadron physics .",
    "this model has been widely applied to investigate the spectroscopy of hadrons and their electromagnetic , weak and strong decays .",
    "the obtained results have very good consistencies with the experimental data to date within the typical ( 10 - 20)% error bars of the technique .",
    "the present work is dedicated to investigation of the semileptonic transition of scalar p wave bottomonium @xmath2 meson with quantum numbers @xmath3 into the pseudoscalar @xmath4 meson .",
    "the @xmath2 state has been observed first in radiative decay of the @xmath5 @xcite and recently has been confirmed by atlas collaboration @xcite together with the higher @xmath6 and @xmath7 states . in the latter ,",
    "these quarkonia states have been produced in proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at @xmath8 and through their radiative decays to @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "our previous theoretical results @xcite on the mass of these states done both in vacuum and finite temperature qcd are in good agreement with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "note that , we also have applied the qcd sum rules approach both in vacuum and finite temperature to investigate the spectroscopy of the pseudoscalar , vector and tensor quarkonia in @xcite . as we know",
    "the masses and decay constants of the quarkonia , it is possible to investigate their electromagnetic , weak ( leptonic - semileptonic ) and strong decays .",
    "considering such decay channels can help us obtain more information about the nature of the scalar @xmath2 meson as well as perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the qcd sum rules for the form factors appearing in the amplitude of the semileptonic decay channel under consideration . to do so , we take into account the two - gluon condensates as the non - perturbative contributions to the correlation function .",
    "section iii is devoted to our numerical analysis of the obtained form factors and their behavior in terms of the transferred momentum squared . in this section",
    ", we also numerically estimate the decay width of the semileptonic @xmath11 decay mode .",
    "the last section encompasses our concluding remarks .",
    "the hadronic event under consideration can be described in terms of quark degrees of freedom by the process @xmath13 at tree - level , whose effective hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fermi weak coupling constant and @xmath16 is an element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "the transition amplitude is obtained via @xmath17 or @xmath18 to proceed , we need to know the transition matrix element @xmath19 whose vector part do not contribute due to parity considerations , i.e. , @xmath20 the axial - vector part of transition matrix element can be parameterized in terms of form factors as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are transition form factors ; and @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "our main goal in the present section is to calculate the transition form factors applying the qcd sum rules technique .",
    "the starting point is to consider the following tree - point correlation function as the main ingredient of the model : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the time ordering product , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the interpolating currents of the @xmath4 and @xmath30 mesons , respectively ; and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vector and axial - vector parts of the transition current . following the general idea in the qcd sum rules technique",
    ", we calculate this correlation function once in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom called physical or phenomenological side and the second in terms of qcd degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons and their interaction with qcd vacuum ) called the qcd side .",
    "the latter is done in the deep euclidean region by the help of operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "these two representations are then matched together , using the quark - hadron duality assumption , through a double dispersion relation to obtain the qcd sum rules for the form factors .",
    "as we deal with the ground states in this approach , we shall separate the ground state from the higher states and continuum .",
    "this is done by two mathematical operations called borel transformation and continuum subtraction .",
    "such transformations bring some auxiliary parameters namely two borel mass parameters and two continuum thresholds for which we will find their working regions in the next section .",
    "the phenomenological side of the correlation function is obtained inserting two complete sets of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as the interpolating currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the contributions coming from higher states and continuum . besides the transition matrix elements defined previously",
    ", the matrix elements of interpolating current between the vacuum and hadronic states are parameterized in terms of the leptonic decay constants , i.e. , @xmath37 putting all expressions together , the final version of the phenomenological side of the correlation function is obtained as @xmath38 + \\mbox{ ... },\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we will choose the structures @xmath39 and @xmath40 , to evaluate the form factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .    at qcd side ,",
    "the correlation function is calculated in deep euclidean region by the help of the ope .",
    "decay : ( a ) the bare loop and ( b , c , d , e , f , g ) two - gluon condensate diagrams.,width=604 ]    for this aim , we write the coefficient of each structure in correlation function as a sum of a perturbative ( diagram a in figure 1 ) and a non - perturbative ( diagrams b , c , d , e , f and g in figure 1 ) parts as follows :    @xmath43    where , the @xmath44 functions are written in terms of double dispersion integrals in the following way : @xmath45 where , @xmath46 are the spectral densities with @xmath47 or @xmath48 . applying the usual feynman integral technique to the bare loop diagram , the spectral densities are calculated via cutkosky rules , i.e. , by replacing the quark propagators with dirac delta functions : @xmath49 implying that all quarks are real .",
    "after some calculations , the spectral densities are obtained as follows : @xmath50,\\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_{2}(s , s',q^2)&=&2n_{c}i_{0}(s , s',q^2)\\big[m_b(m_b+m_c)-a(h - s ) + b(h - s')\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51,\\nonumber\\\\ b&=&\\frac{1}{\\lambda(s , s',q^{2})}\\big[2(m_b^2-m_c^2)s+su'\\big ] , \\nonumber\\\\ h&=&2m_b(m_b - m_c),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here also @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the number of colors .",

    "( [ dispersionrelation ] ) ( bare loop diagram ) is determined requiring that the arguments of the three @xmath57 functions vanish , simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the physical region in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 plane is described by the following inequality : @xmath60 } { \\lambda^{1/2}(m_{b}^2,s , m_{b}^2)\\lambda^{1/2}(s , s',q^2)}\\leq+1.\\ ] ] for the non - perturbative part , we take into account the two - gluon condensate diagrams ( b , c , d , e , f , g ) in figure 1 . here we should mention that we deal with the heavy quarks in the present work and the heavy quarks condensates are suppressed by inverse of their masses , so we can ignore them safely .",
