    "from the time of hawking s discovery that black holes radiate with the black - body radiation , the problem of information stored in a black hole @xcite attracted much attention .",
    "different ideas were discussed , in particular those of remnants @xcite , `` fuzziness '' of the black hole @xcite and refs .",
    "therein , quantum hair @xcite and refs.therein . , and smearing of horizon by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of the last approach is that small fluctuations of the background geometry lead to corrections to the form of the density matrix of radiation .",
    "these corrections are supposed to account for correlations between the black hole and radiation and contain the imprint of information thrown into the black hole with the collapsing matter .",
    "the idea that horizon of the black hole is not located at the rigid position naturally follows from the observation that a black hole as a quantum object is described by the wave functional over geometries @xcite . in particular , the sum over horizon areas yields the black hole entropy .    in papers @xcite the density matrix of black hole radiation",
    "was calculated in a model with fluctuating horizon .",
    "horizon fluctuations modify the hawking density matrix producing off - diagonal elements .",
    "horizon fluctuations were taken into account by convolution the density matrix calculated with the instantaneous horizon radius @xmath0 with the black hole wave function which was taken in the gaussian form @xmath1 .",
    "effectively the wave function introduces the smearing of the classical horizon radius @xmath2 .",
    "the width of the distribution , @xmath3 , was taken of order the plank lengths @xmath4 @xcite . in paper",

    "we reconsider calculation the density matrix of radiation emitted from the black hole formed by the collapsing shell .",
    "the shell is supposed to follow the infalling trajectory which is the exact solution to the matching equations connecting the interior ( minkowski ) and exterior ( schwarzschild ) geometries of the space - time @xcite . in this",
    "setting one can trace propagation of a ray ( we consider only s - modes ) through the shell from the past to the future infinity .",
    "for the rays propagating in the vicinity of the horizon we obtain an exact formula connecting @xmath5 at the past infinity and @xmath6 at the future infinity .",
    "we obtain the expression for the `` smeared '' density matrix of hawking radiation of the black hole with the horizon smeared by fluctuations . in the limit @xmath7 the smeared density matrix turns to the hawking density matrix .",
    "the smeared density matrix is not diagonal and can be expressed as a sum of the `` classical part '' and off - diagonal correction which is roughly of order @xmath8 of the classical part . as a function of of frequencies @xmath9 of",
