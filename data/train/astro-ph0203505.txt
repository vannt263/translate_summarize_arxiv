    "the origin of galactic disk warping , which is typically vertical bending of disks in a integral shape , is a long - standing problem . even after 40 year efforts to explain the phenomena since the discovery of the warp in the milky way @xcite",
    ", there is still no generally acceptable theory .",
    "a general review of the problem can be found in .",
    "there are several observational facts that any convincing theory must explain .",
    "the first point is the longevity of the warps .",
    "observations of neutral hydrogen layers @xcite and stellar disks @xcite have revealed that about a half of spiral galaxies exhibit warps .",
    "such high frequency of warps indicate that the warps are long - lived with about the same age as galaxies , otherwise some mechanism keeps exciting the warps . in both cases the warp excitation mechanism must be ubiquitous .",
    "the second point is the warp amplitude .",
    "for instance the milky way has a prominent warp and its amplitude is 2  kpc at galactocentric distances @xmath5  kpc@xcite , and 4  kpc at @xmath6  kpc @xcite .",
    "the torque that can bend the disk in such a large amplitudes is so strong , which make it difficult to find the source of the torque @xcite .",
    "the third point is alignment of the warp nodes .",
    "most of spiral galaxies including our own have straight line of nodes within the holmberg radius , and outward the lines of nodes make leading spirals @xcite .",
    "this fact presents a contrast to the spiral arms in the grand - design spiral .",
    "simple analysis @xcite shows that the simplest interpretation of the warp as a vertical oscillation of matters without considering selfgravity , is not working , because the line of nodes wind up in a time scale of 1 or 2  gyr .",
    "therefore self - consistent treatment is necessary .",
    "there are several hopeful theories , all of which have , however , some shortcomings .    the first step to understand long - lived warps is the normal mode analysis in steady state galaxies .",
    "showed that there are many bending normal modes in their thin - disk models , but unless density of the disks are cut - off sharply at their edges the frequency spectrum is at least partly continuous . in such disks any realistic perturbation would excite propagating wave packets ,",
    "thus the warping wave is dispersed .",
    "a long - lived warp can correspond only to a discrete mode .",
    "if the disk is truncated at some radius , there is only one discrete normal mode , which is called a _ modified tilt mode _ @xcite .",
    "showed that if disk is embedded in a flattened halo there is at most one discrete mode .",
    "shapes of the mode show good agreement with observed warps , and even though the disk is not in the right shape of the modified tilt mode initially , it dynamically evolves to fit the mode @xcite .",
    "the normal mode theory works very well as long as the halo is treated as a rigid body .",
    "however , once the self - consistent response of halo is included several problems emerge .",
    "for example , dynamical friction acting on the disk from the halo dissipates the warping motion @xcite , and also the line of nodes often winds up tightly @xcite . to find the normal modes in fully self - consistent composite systems of a disk and a halo is extremely intractable .",
    "one possible mechanism to keep the misalignment between a disk and a halo symmetric plane is continuous addition of matter with misaligned angular momentum to the halo .",
    "inclined cosmic infall @xcite might support the mechanism .",
    "have shown that when infall reorientates the outer part of a galactic halo by several degrees per gyr , a realistic warp is excited .",
    "though the result seems appealing , their model of the infall is still too idealistic , and numerical studies are relatively short ( @xmath7 1  gyr ) to explain long - lived warps .",
    "refined studies are necessary .",
    "another mechanism , which we are examining in this paper , is interaction with satellites .",
    "this mechanism is intuitively plausible because the most frequent @xmath8 warp is easily associated with a tidal field from a satellite . furthermore increasing",
    "observational evidence suggests that most of the galaxies have satellite dwarfs .",
    "in fact , recently a faint dwarf companion has been discovered around ngc 5907 , which was considered as a typical example of a warping galaxy without interacting companions @xcite .",
    "also statistics show positive correlation between warping and existence of interacting companions @xcite    the only but severe problem of the interaction scenario is that the tidal forces from satellites are usually too small .",
    "for example , showed that the direct tidal force from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) of @xmath9 at 50  kpc can excite a warp with an amplitude at largest 100  pc at 16  kpc , while the real galactic warp is about 3  kpc .    against the problem ,",
    "a remedy was proposed by ( hereafter w1998 ) .",
    "main point of his idea is to incorporate the halo response to the orbiting motion of a satellite into the source of the tidal forces . as the satellite moves , rotating density waves which have resonant frequencies to the satellite rotation are excited . in a nearly isothermal halo",
    "the most dominant wake appears at the position of 2:1 resonance , which is at about half distance to the satellite orbit .",
    "and the mass of the wake is about the same as the satellite , thus its tidal force is much larger than those from the satellite .",
    "w1998 showed with linear analysis for infinitely thin disks , that the tidal forces from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and its wake are large enough to excite the observable warp .    in order to prove this idea , fully self - consistent numerical simulations of three - dimensional disks are necessary",
    "this is , in fact , very difficult and expensive , because we have to treat the small vertical motions of a very thin disk embedded in a very massive halo , which is extended well beyond the lmc orbit .",
    "w1998 estimated that 1 million particles are necessary to reduce numerical noise in order to distinguish meaningful dynamics of the disk .",
    "this requirement is here accomplished by using a hybrid algorithm , tree - scf @xcite , which particularly suits our problem of warping disk dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we make the models as close to the real milky way  lmc system as possible , so that we can make precise evaluation of the warp amplitudes .    in section  [ sec : galaxy_models ] we first describe by a brief summary the method to construct the galaxy models using , then give some parameters of the models which we use in this study .",
    "the precise input parameters in the codes are listed in the appendix",
    ". section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] explains algorithms and parameters of the tree - scf code .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are given in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "the aim of this study is to examine the influence of the lmc on excitation of the galactic warp . therefore we must first construct equilibrium galaxy models that have no warp , and then put a satellite in the lmc orbit .    to construct equilibrium models for a multi - component system like",
    "the milky way is actually a hard task .",
    "many galactic models are constructed with the assumptions that the halo and bulge are static backgrounds , or assuming that velocity distribution is gaussian and solving only the jeans equations .",
    "the deviation of these approximations from a true equilibrium causes initial transient behavior , in other words relaxation into the true equilibrium . that behavior changes the initial distribution especially in the disk . in the disk warping problem",
    "it is necessary to avoid any disturbance on the disk other than that from the satellite .    a suitable initial model is given by ( hereafter kd1995 ) , which is nearly an exact solution of the collisionless boltzmann and poisson s equations . in their method , the configurations of a halo , bulge , and disk are given by means of distribution functions which depend only on integrals of motion . by the jeans theorem such distribution functions are already steady state solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "densities can be calculated from the distribution functions , which depend on the positions only through the potential function .",
    "therefore the main task is to determine the functional form of the potential by solving poisson s equation numerically .",
    "the halo distribution function takes the form @xmath10",
    "\\left [ \\exp ( -e/\\sigma_0 ^ 2 ) -1\\right ]   \\quad &        \\mathrm{if } e<0 , \\\\        0 & \\mathrm{otherwise } , \\\\",

    "this distribution function has five free parameters : the potential at the center @xmath15 , which appears implicitly through the definition of the relative energy , the velocity scale @xmath16 , and three factors @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this distribution is based on evans s model , which has axisymmetric logarithmic potential , but is truncated at a finite radius by lowering the distribution function in the same manner as the lowered isothermal models .",
    "the factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 control the system flattening ( @xmath20 ) and the core radius ( @xmath21 ) , respectively , and all the three factors are scaled by the density scale ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the bulge distribution function is the same as a king model @xcite and has the form @xmath23 &        \\{\\exp[-(e-\\psi_\\mathrm{c})/\\sigma_\\mathrm{b}^2]-1\\ } \\\\        &",

    "@xmath24 is the cutoff potential , @xmath25 the central bulge density , and @xmath26 the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "the disk distribution must depend on 3 integrals of motion , in order to keep the triaxial velocity ellipsoid in the disk @xcite .",
    "the third integral is , however , not known as any analytical function , so that distribution function can not be written as an analytical function . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "an approximated distribution function is employed which depends on the energy in the vertical oscillations , @xmath29 , and that in planer motion , @xmath30 , as well as @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath31 is quite well conserved for stars in nearly circular orbits .",
    "the form is      where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the radius and energy of a circular orbit with angular momentum @xmath11 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the circular and epicyclic frequencies at radius @xmath33 .",
    "the ` tilde ' functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are free functions . therefore the density and the radial velocity dispersion are conveniently selected as @xmath40,\\ ] ] and @xmath41 @xmath37 and @xmath39 are iteratively adjusted so that the densities on the mid - plane and at height @xmath42 will agree with those given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : disk_density ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the disk has 6 free parameters : the disk mass , @xmath43 , the radial scale length @xmath44 , the vertical scale height @xmath45 , the disk truncation radius @xmath46 , the truncation width @xmath47 , and the central velocity dispersion of the disk @xmath48 .",

    "their algorithm consists of the following 4 steps .",

    "( ii ) the potential is substituted into the density functions which are calculated from the distribution functions .",
