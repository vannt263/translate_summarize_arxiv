    "<S> we show that the current extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) measurement below 100 gev sets an upper limit on egb itself at very high energy ( vhe ) above 100 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the limit is conservative for the electromagnetic cascade emission from vhe egb interacting with the cosmic microwave - to - optical background radiation not to exceed the current egb measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the cascade component fits the measured vhe egb spectrum rather well . </S>",
    "<S> however , once we add the contribution from known source classes , the _ fermi _ vhe egb observation exceeds or even violates the limit , which is approximated as @xmath0 . the upper limit above 100 gev is useful in the future to probe the egb origin and the new physics like axion - like particles and lorentz - invariance violation . </S>"
