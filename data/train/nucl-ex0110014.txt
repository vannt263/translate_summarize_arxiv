    "an important question in low - energy nuclear physics is whether a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is sufficient to describe few - nucleon systems or whether a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) is necessary when the system consists of a@xmath8 . to solve for the bound and scattering states of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) system ,",
    "state - of - the - art theoretical methods like the faddeev method  @xcite ( which works well for n - d scattering ) have been developed .",
    "it was not until the advancement of variational techniques  @xcite which could include the coulomb force rigorously that serious comparisons could be made with p - d scattering data .",
    "current theoretical investigations incorporate phenomenological nn potentials such as cd bonn  @xcite , nijmegen iii  @xcite , and argonne @xmath9 ( av18 )  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are based on the one - pion - exchange potential for large interparticle separations as well as fits to the present nn database . when calculations using those models are performed in the three - nucleon system , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 binding energies are underestimated by approximately @xmath12 to @xmath13  mev depending on which nn potential is employed .",
    "the under - prediction of the @xmath14 binding energies is the first indication that the two - nucleon interaction alone , as parameterized by the nn potentials in their current forms , is insufficient for an accurate description of the 3n data .",
    "to remedy the situation , phenomenological 3n potentials such as the tuscon - melbourne ( tm )  @xcite , the brazil ( br )  @xcite , and the urbana ix ( ur - ix )  @xcite were introduced which are based on the 2@xmath15 exchange interaction and adjusted to reproduce the triton binding energies . by applying chiral - perturbation theory to the 3nfs , friar _",

    "@xcite showed that the present phenomenological 3nfs are equivalent to first - order in the lagrangian they constructed except for one term in the tm potential which was found to be of next - to - leading order .    beyond the binding - energy problem",
    ", there is another large discrepancy in the properties of the 3n system , namely the vector analyzing powers ( vaps ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 for n - d scattering .",

    "when the tm 3n - potential is included , the vap calculations show slightly worse agreement with the data ( 39% and 34% differences ) than in the case of the ur - ix potential . however , when the tm@xmath44 potential is used , the calculations are closer to the vap data than for the case of the ur - ix potential ; the difference between @xmath1(@xmath2 ) data and the calculations is 32%(25% ) .",

    "[ sec : chi2 ] .",
    "besides the tm@xmath44 potential , other modified nn and 3n force models have recently become available .",
    "for example , a new nn interaction constructed from chiral perturbation theory seems to give a better description of the vap data at low energy  @xcite",
    ". a different possibility may be in the construction of a new 3n force .",
    "hber and friar  @xcite have suggested that a possible candidate should be a spin - dependent 3nf since the vap is a difference between polarized cross - sections . following this direction ,",
    "a phenomenological 3n @xmath50 force has recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this new force essentially modifies the scalar function @xmath51 already present in the @xmath50 term of the av18 potential in triplet spin and isospin channels .",

    "this force influences the splitting of the @xmath60 phases and the magnitude of @xmath61 without appreciably affecting the other parameters .",

    "@xcite , and the results are listed in the first two lines of table  [ ta : psatrials667 ] .",
    "none of the data were renormalized in order to find a minimal @xmath49 . from @xmath49 calculations , it is possible to draw conclusions similar to those from the visual comparisons : the @xmath0 and the tap data are reproduced very well while vap data show poorer agreement with theory",
    ". however , all of the @xmath49 are improved when a 3nf is included . for @xmath0",
    ", @xmath49 improves by an order of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath49 is reduced significantly for each tap .",
    "the calculations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with ur - ix show improved agreement with the data ; however , the @xmath49 remains in the hundreds .",
    "the technique of phase shift analysis ( psa ) is useful for determining the dependences of the observables on the various partial waves , and also for studying the sources of disagreements between theory and experiment .",
    "here we consider data at two energies : @xmath6  kev , the energy of the present data , and also @xmath7  kev , the energy of previous measurements in our laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the psas reported here are carried out in the framework of seyler  @xcite , where the scattering matrix is parameterized in terms of phase shifts and mixing parameters .",
    "the phase shift parameters in general depend on orbital angular momentum @xmath64 , total angular momentum @xmath65 , and the channel spin @xmath66 .",
    "the mixing parameters connect partial waves with different @xmath64 and/or @xmath66 for a given @xmath65 and parity .    before embarking upon a detailed psa , it is important to understand the convergence of the observables versus the angular momentum cutoff",
    ". studies were performed using the av18+ur - ix calculations for the phase shifts and mixing parameters .",
    "the dependence on the angular momentum cutoff @xmath67 was examined by setting to zero all phase shifts and mixing parameters with @xmath68 for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "note that the effect of the coulomb potential is retained in all partial waves , so it is expected that the observables will converge quickly .",
    "we have quantified the convergence of the observables by using @xmath69 comparisons of the calculations with different @xmath67 values to the experimental data at @xmath7 and 667  kev .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : conv ] .",
    "first of all we find very little change in @xmath69 between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , indicating , as expected , that the results are already well - converged with @xmath70 at these low energies .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the cross section and taps are fairly well described with @xmath72 , while only @xmath73 is required to produce a similar level of convergence for the vaps .",
    "smaller , but statistically - significant improvements are obtained by extending to @xmath70 .",
    "we have also observed in these studies that the observables @xmath3 and @xmath5 are highly dependent on the @xmath74 phase shifts and mixing parameters .",
    "single - energy psas have been performed by using the phase shifts and mixing parameters produced by the av18+ur - ix potential as starting values .",
    "some of the parameters are allowed to vary freely ; the best - fit values for the variable parameters are determined by @xmath21 minimization with attention given to the fitting procedure to avoid local minima .",
    "phase shifts were included up to a maximum angular momentum of @xmath75 , but only those with @xmath76 were allowed to vary .",
    "previous phase - shift analyses  @xcite have linked the vap problem to the @xmath77-wave phase - shifts . to test the effects of the different @xmath77-wave phase - shifts and their associated mixing parameters , two - parameter fits where made",
    ". tables  [ ta : psatrials667 ] and  [ ta : psatrials431 ] show the @xmath78 at the two energies for sample trials where only the @xmath77-wave phase - shifts were varied . by varying the @xmath79 phase - shifts and/or the mixing parameter @xmath80 freely ( trials 1 and 2 )",
    ", there is very little change in the @xmath78 with the exception of @xmath2 at 431.3  kev . with the combination of @xmath61 and a @xmath60 phase - shift",
    "( trials 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , good fits were produced with the most dramatic improvement occurring in each vap . at @xmath6  kev , the @xmath78 reduced by a factor of approximately 300 for @xmath1 and a factor of 30 for @xmath2 .",
    "for the @xmath7  kev case , the fits produced reductions in @xmath78 by factors of approximately 20 and 10 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , with the exception of the fit to @xmath2 with the free parameters @xmath81 and @xmath61 .",
    "a comparison of the three @xmath60 trials indicates that the two - parameter fit with the @xmath82 phase - shift and @xmath61 gives the best result although the differences with the other two trials are very small .",
    "these trials so far illustrate the influence of the @xmath77-wave phase - shifts and @xmath61 ; however , a more realistic fit ( trial 6 ) is to allow all of the @xmath66- and @xmath77-wave phase - shifts with @xmath80 and @xmath61 to vary freely ( 9 parameters in all ) . the remaining phases and mixing parameters were taken from the av18+ur - ix calculations  @xcite .",
    "the results of the fits are listed in table  [ ta : psa ] .",
    "while there were improvements with the full @xmath66- and @xmath77-wave fits over the two parameter @xmath60 fits , the reduction in @xmath78 is small . to make a more quantitative comparison between trials , errors were determined for specific parameters by the change in a specific parameter necessary to increase the minimal @xmath21 by 1  @xcite . allowing more parameters to vary led to a larger error in each parameter which underlies our attempts to find the best fit with the least number of parameters .",
    "the uncertainties in phase shifts and mixing parameters when all @xmath66- and @xmath77-wave parameters were varied are given in table  [ ta : psa ] .",
    "these errors reflect the contribution of statistical uncertainties in the data only .",
    "the psa presented here produced very good fits to the data sets at @xmath7  kev and 667  kev with sensible results .",
    "the greatest influence on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 fits came from the @xmath60 phase - shifts and @xmath61 parameter .",
    "this result was noticed in the earlier analyses  @xcite at higher energies .",
    "it is difficult to provide a more precise value from the psa for each phase - shift with the present data sets at 431.3  kev and 667  kev .",
    "what these analyses do confirm is the need to modify the @xmath60 phase - shifts and the mixing between the @xmath81 and the @xmath83 phase - shifts ( as evident from the change in @xmath61 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 was increased ( in absolute value ) by about @xmath84 from the 667  kev psa and by about @xmath85 from the 431.3  kev psa over the predicted value even when the ur - ix potential was included in the calculations .",
    "the reader should be cautioned that the errors from both analyses allow much wider ranges of values for @xmath61 .",
    "the theoretical calculations also appear to underestimate the splitting @xmath86 .",
    "for example at 667 kev the calculated splitting is @xmath87 compared to @xmath88 obtained in the fit . at 431.3 kev",
    "the difference is even bigger ; the calculated value is @xmath89 compared to @xmath90 from the fit .",
    "the small , but nevertheless important , underestimation of @xmath91 has been found also in the calculations at @xmath22 mev  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented high - precision measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for p - d elastic scattering at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath92  kev .",
    "the cross section and tap data show excellent agreement with the variational calculations using the av18 and ur - ix potentials .",
    "the `` @xmath1 puzzle '' persists at this energy with the inclusion of the ur - ix in the calculations giving a small improvement in the agreement with the vap data . in order to extend the analysis to different forms of the 3nfs ,",
    "the av18+tm and av18+tm@xmath44 potential models have also been considered in the comparisons to the data .",
    "the calculations with either tm potential under - predict the vap data by a similar amount as in the case of the av18+ur - ix results . from the reduced @xmath21 analysis ,",
    "it is clear that adding a 3nf into the calculations improves the agreement with the data for all of the observables .    from a single - energy psa at very low energies ( @xmath7  kev and 667  kev )",
    ", the under - prediction of the vap data by the calculations appears to be caused by certain @xmath77-wave components . by varying two parameters , @xmath61 and one of the @xmath60 phase - shifts , and maintaining all of the other parameters as determined from theory ,",
    "an almost perfect fit was achieved for @xmath1 . for @xmath2 , the @xmath49",
    "was reduced by more than an order of magnitude to approximately 1.3 for the 431.3  kev psa and 1.8 for the 667  kev analysis . to obtain an even better fit ,",
    "all of the @xmath66- and @xmath77-wave phase - shifts along with @xmath80 and @xmath61 were varied freely to obtain @xmath78 of @xmath93 for each observable .",
    "the results of this analysis are the same within the errors as the psa with @xmath61 and a @xmath60 phase - shift as the only free parameters . from comparisons of the psa results to calculations",
    "it is evident that the theory underestimates the splitting of the @xmath60 phase shifts as well as the mixing between @xmath83 and @xmath81 .",
    "the inclusion of a phenomenological 3n spin - orbit force , which fixes the @xmath77-wave mixing in the calculations , provides better agreement with the vap data without disturbing the agreement obtained for the cross - section and tap data .",
    "while this fact does not determine the existence of a 3nf , it indicates a need to develop and refine the current 3n potential models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can not rule out the possibility that currently employed nn @xmath94 interactions are incorrect  @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath63 problem can be studied with information from p-@xmath10 elastic scattering data .",
    "the variational calculations employed in this paper have recently been extended to the p-@xmath10 scattering observables  @xcite .",
    "in this case there is an underprediction by approximately 40% of new @xmath63 data taken at an @xmath95 below 2  mev .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 for p-@xmath10 scattering is an order of magnitude larger than for the p - d scattering case .",
    "this fact makes it an ideal candidate for future investigations , and more p-@xmath96 elastic scattering data at low energies is needed .",
