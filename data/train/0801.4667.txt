    "the oslo group has reported unexpected enhancements in the radiative strength functions ( rsf ) of low energy @xmath1-rays for the @xmath3sc , @xmath4v , @xmath5fe and @xmath6mo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these results , which have been obtained with the oslo method  @xcite , have gained broad interest in the nuclear physics community .",
    "the @xmath0mo nucleus has become a benchmark for other experimental groups trying to verify or falsify the oslo results .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath0mo was not analyzed in an optimal way , and we have therefore decided to reanalyze these data sets .",
    "the two data sets were recorded from the @xmath0mo(@xmath7he,@xmath7he@xmath8)@xmath0mo and @xmath9mo(@xmath7he,@xmath10)@xmath0mo reactions . in this work",
    "we use the same key parameters for the normalizations as previously  @xcite , namely a level density of @xmath11  mev@xmath12 and an average total radiative width of @xmath13 mev ( from @xmath14-wave resonances ) at the neutron binding energy @xmath15 .",
    "experimental details and further references are found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the new analyzes concern two major points . in the old extraction of rsf",
    ", we included the @xmath1-ray energies close or below the strong 778 kev @xmath16 ground band transition .",
    "this transitional region in the experimental @xmath17 matrix is not properly subtracted in the first - generation procedure  @xcite and is now excluded .",
    "the second point concerns the estimate of the @xmath1-ray multiplicity as function of excitation energy , which is an important quantity both for normalizing the @xmath1 spectra with respect to each other and weighting the higher - order generation spectra in the subtraction procedure  @xcite . in the previous analyses , we estimated the statistical multiplicity at excitation energy @xmath18 by introducing a lower @xmath1-ray threshold @xmath19 and an effective excitation energy @xmath20 giving @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average energy of the @xmath1 spectrum for @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 parameter mimics the excitation energy at which the statistical @xmath1 transitions enter the ground band .",
    "this treatment is applicable to rare earth nuclei , where the detector system efficiency for the lowest ground state band transitions , typically the @xmath25 and the @xmath16 transitions , is low .",
    "however , for @xmath0mo the energy of the lowest ground band transitions are detected easily .",
    "therefore , in the present analysis we use the straightforward expression for the total @xmath1-ray multiplicity @xmath26 where we simply divide the excitation energy by the average energy of the @xmath1 spectrum .",

    "the data from the new analysis is compared with previously published data  @xcite . ]",
    "both the level density and the radiative strength function will be slightly modified by the new multiplicity expression .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] compare the new level densities and radiative strength functions with previous data @xcite . we see a very good resemblance between the pick - up reaction and the inelastic scattering reaction .",
    "the error bars include statistical errors only .",
    "the new level densities are very similar to the previous ones .",
    "the same is true for the rsfs , except that the upbend is less pronounced due to the exclusion of the 778 kev transition .",
    "the values of the data points can be found at http://ocl.uio.no / compilation/.    there have been some misunderstandings concerning the description of the rsf upbend for low @xmath1 energies given by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are fit parameters , and @xmath31 is given in mev .",
    "the formula was chosen in order to fit the low - energy data by only two parameters .",
    "we would like to stress that this description should not be used for @xmath1 energies lower than the experimental data points . in the extreme case",
    "when @xmath32 , it is clear that the description is totally unrealistic as it gives wrong @xmath1 multiplicity .",
    "the radiative strength function of @xmath0mo has been reanalyzed giving a slightly less pronounced enhancement at lower @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "the data points at and below the 778 kev @xmath16 transition have been omitted . since extraction of level density is coupled to the radiative strength function ,",
    "new level densities have also been presented .    financial support from the norwegian research council ( nfr ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
