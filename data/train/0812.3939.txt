    "the aim of this article is to introduce a new kind of ` holomorphic symplectic reduction ' , which produces a holomorphic symplectic @xmath6-fold from a holomorphic symplectic @xmath1-fold .",
    "locally it can be seen as a holomorphic version of the symplectic reduction coming from an @xmath7-action , though the group action does not globalize .",
    "a summary of the construction is as follows .",
    "we start with a @xmath1-dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath2 with holomorphic two - form @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a hypersurface .",
    "the kernel of @xmath3 defines a rank one foliation @xmath10 on the smooth locus of @xmath0 , which we call the _",
    "characteristic foliation_. if this foliation has compact leaves , then we can construct a space of leaves @xmath4 which will be hausdorff .",
    "note that @xmath4 has dimension @xmath5 and it may be singular .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 will descend to a non - degenerate holomorphic two - form on the smooth part of @xmath4 .",
    "although our main interest in this article is hypersurfaces , we will also consider some examples where @xmath9 is a submanifold of codimension @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath3 must have rank at least @xmath12 at each point of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ coisotropic _ if the rank of @xmath3 is constant and equal to @xmath12 at all points of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the kernel of @xmath3 defines a characteristic foliation @xmath10 of rank @xmath13 .",
    "if this foliation has compact leaves , the space of leaves @xmath4 will be a ( possibly singular ) holomorphic symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath14 .",
    "the fundamental question is thus : can we find hypersurfaces and/or submanifolds @xmath9 whose characteristic foliations @xmath15 have compact leaves ? given a foliation on a projective variety , a criterion for algebraicity ( and hence compactness ) of the leaves was given in a recent theorem of kebekus , sol conde , and toma  @xcite , building on results of miyaoka  @xcite and bogomolov and mcquillan  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a smooth hypersurface ( so that @xmath15 is regular everywhere ) or a coisotropic submanifold .",
    "it follows from the theorem of kebekus et al .  that if @xmath0 is covered by curves @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is ample then every leaf is algebraic ( and hence compact ) and rationally connected .",
    "we will explain how this ensures that the space of leaves @xmath4 is not only hausdorff , but also smooth .",
    "one potential application of these ideas is to constructing new examples of holomorphic symplectic manifolds .",
    "we will describe how a birational model of ogrady s example in ten - dimensions  @xcite arises in this way , starting from a hypersurface in the hilbert scheme @xmath18 of six points on a k3 surface @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noted that the space of leaves @xmath4 here is ( presumably ) quite singular and one still has to apply ogrady s desingularization procedure to arrive at a smooth birational model of his space .",
    "another potential application is to the classification of holomorphic symplectic manifolds up to deformation , and we consider two main results in this direction .",
    "the goal is to describe @xmath2 in terms of the lower - dimensional space @xmath4 , thereby building a classification inductively on the dimension .",
    "when @xmath2 is four - dimensional the space of leaves @xmath4 is a holomorphic symplectic surface ; if @xmath4 is smooth , it must be a k3 or abelian surface .",
    "for example , let @xmath0 be the inverse image of the diagonal @xmath20 in the hilbert scheme of two points on a k3 surface @xmath19 , @xmath21 then every leaf is a rational curve @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is of course isomorphic to the k3 surface @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , nagai  @xcite proved that if a holomorphic symplectic four - fold contains a divisor @xmath0 which is ` numerically like ' the one above ( in particularly , it can be contracted to a surface @xmath19 ) then @xmath19 is a k3 surface and @xmath24 .",
    "we consider nagai s theorem in the context of foliations , adding some new observations .",
    "the second main classification result involves holomorphic symplectic manifolds which are lagrangian fibrations by jacobians of curves .",
    "let @xmath2 be the total space of the relative compactified jacobian of a family @xmath25 of genus two curves over @xmath26 .",
    "markushevich  @xcite proved that if @xmath2 is a holomorphic symplectic four - fold then @xmath27 is a complete linear system of curves in a k3 surface @xmath19 ; in other words , @xmath2 is the beauville - mukai integrable system  @xcite , and in particular , @xmath2 is a deformation of @xmath28 .",
    "markushevich constructed the k3 surface @xmath19 as a branched double cover of the dual plane @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , we will explain how the k3 surface @xmath19 can be described as the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation on a hypersurface @xmath9 ; namely , we take @xmath0 to be the total space of @xmath27 , embedded in @xmath2 by the relative abel - jacobi map . the author has used this approach to generalize markushevich s theorem to higher dimensions  @xcite : roughly speaking , if the total space @xmath2 of the relative compactified jacobian of a family @xmath30 of genus @xmath31 curves over @xmath32 is a holomorphic symplectic manifold , then @xmath27 is a complete linear system of curves in a k3 surface @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath2 is the beauville - mukai integrable system and hence deformation equivalent to @xmath33 . for the proof one again takes @xmath0 to be the total space of @xmath27 , embedded by the relative abel - jacobi map , though this time @xmath0 will be of higher codimension and",
    "thus one must also prove that @xmath0 is coisotropic .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the main constructions and prove some general results concerning characteristic foliations . in section 3",
    "we describe a number of examples . in sections 4 , 5 , and 6",
    "we discuss how nagai s theorem , markushevich s theorem , and ogrady s example in ten dimensions , respectively , can be understood in terms of foliations on hypersurfaces .",
    "finally , in section 7 we make comparisons with the analogous situation in real symplectic geometry ; in particular , we formulate a holomorphic analogue of the weinstein conjecture , asserting the existence of compact leaves for the characteristic foliation on a hypersurface of contact type .    while this paper was being written a preprint of hwang and oguiso  @xcite appeared .",
    "they use methods similar to ours to study the singular fibres of a lagrangian fibration ; namely , if @xmath34 is a lagrangian fibration , and @xmath35 is the discriminant locus parametrizing singular fibres , then hwang and oguiso study the characteristic foliation on the hypersurface @xmath36 and prove that the leaves are either elliptic curves or chains of rational curves .",
    "this in turn tells us something about the structure of the generic singular fibre @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a generic point of @xmath20 .",
    "hwang and viehweg  @xcite also consider characteristic foliations on hypersurfaces of general type ; we mention their results in subsection  2.2 .",
    "the author would like to thank jun - muk hwang , yujiro kawamata , stefan kebekus , manfred lehn , and keiji oguiso for many helpful discussions on the material presented here .",
    "the author is also grateful for the hospitality of the max - planck - institut fr mathematik ( bonn ) , the institute for mathematical sciences ( chinese university of hong kong ) , and the korea institute for advanced studies , where these results were obtained .",
    "a holomorphic symplectic manifold is a compact khler manifold @xmath2 with a non - degenerate holomorphic symplectic form @xmath39 . in particular ,",
    "the dimension @xmath40 is even . `",
    "non - degenerate ' means that @xmath41 trivializes the canonical bundle @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath2 is simply - connected and @xmath43 is one - dimensional , i.e. , generated by @xmath8 , then we say that @xmath2 is irreducible .    for a general compact complex manifold @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath43 is a quotient of the derham cohomology group @xmath44 ; but if @xmath2 is khler then it follows from hodge theory that the projection splits and @xmath43 is a direct summand of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the holomorphic symplectic form @xmath8 is @xmath45-closed .",
    "let @xmath9 be a complex hypersurface , possibly with singularities .",
    "the restriction @xmath46 must be degenerate ; therefore the morphism of sheaves @xmath47 given by contracting a vector field with @xmath3 will not be injective . define a distribution @xmath10 as the kernel of this morphism .",
    "since @xmath8 is @xmath45-closed the distribution is integrable , i.e. , if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are local sections of @xmath15 then @xmath50,w)=d\\sigma|_y(v , u , w)+v\\sigma|_y(u , w)-u\\sigma|_y(v , w)=0\\ ] ] so @xmath51 $ ] is also a local section of @xmath15 .",
    "the characteristic foliation on @xmath0 is the foliation defined by the distribution above . by abuse of notation , we use @xmath15 to denote both the distribution and the foliation .",
    "this notion of integrability of the distribution should not be confused with ( algebraic ) integrability of the foliation , meaning that the leaves are algebraic .",
    "we will discuss the latter shortly .",
    "strictly speaking , a foliation in differential geometry should have constant rank , though algebraic geometers often consider foliations which are not regular .",
    "in other words , the rank of @xmath15 may jump up on closed subsets of @xmath0 ; the following lemma shows that this can only happen on the singular locus of @xmath0 .    over the smooth locus @xmath52 of @xmath0",
    "the foliation @xmath15 is locally free of rank one .",
    "since @xmath8 is non - degenerate on @xmath2 , @xmath3 must be of constant rank @xmath5 as a skew - symmetric form over smooth points of @xmath0 , and thus @xmath53 will be of constant rank one . more explicitly , if @xmath0 is given locally by @xmath54 in the neighbourhood of a smooth point , then by the holomorphic darboux theorem we can find local coordinates such that @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath10 is generated by @xmath57 .    over the smooth locus @xmath52",
    ", @xmath15 is isomorphic to @xmath58 . in particular , if @xmath0 is normal then @xmath59 .    consider the exact sequence @xmath60 over the smooth locus @xmath52 , the holomorphic two - form @xmath3 induces a non - degenerate skew - symmetric form on @xmath61 , as we have quotiented out the null directions .",
    "this implies that @xmath62 is trivial and @xmath63 over @xmath52 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath9 is a ( smooth ) complex submanifold of codimension @xmath13 .",
    "once again we get an integrable distribution , i.e. , a foliation , @xmath10 defined as the kernel of @xmath3 . however , even though @xmath0 is smooth , the rank of @xmath3 could vary .",
    "the rank of @xmath8 restricted to @xmath64 must be even , at least @xmath12 , and at most @xmath65 when @xmath66 these minimum and maximum values coincide , but this is no longer the case for @xmath67 .",
    "the rank is also semi - continuous : , meaning that @xmath68 is a closed subset of @xmath0 for each @xmath69 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is a coisotropic submanifold if the rank of @xmath3 takes its minimum value @xmath12 at all points of @xmath0 , i.e. , if @xmath70 is a coisotropic subspace for all @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a coisotropic submanifold then the kernel @xmath10 of @xmath3 will be locally free of rank @xmath13 over @xmath0 .",
    "we once again have an exact sequence @xmath72 which implies that @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "perhaps the earliest criteria for algebraicity and rationality of the leaves of a holomorphic foliation are due to miyaoka  @xcite .",
    "his results were further developed by bogomolov and mcquillan  @xcite .",
    "here we quote results of kebekus , sol conde , and toma  @xcite .",
    "[ kebekus ] let @xmath0 be a normal projective variety , @xmath75 a complete curve contained in the smooth locus of @xmath0 , and @xmath10 a foliation which is regular over @xmath16 .",
    "assume that @xmath17 is an ample vector bundle .",
    "then the leaf through any point of @xmath16 is algebraic , and the closure of the leaf through the generic point of @xmath16 is rationally connected .",
    "if in addition @xmath15 is regular everywhere then all leaves are rationally connected .",
    "this kind of result is proved by applying mori s bend - and - break argument to the curve @xmath16 , thereby producing rational curves in the leaves of @xmath15 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath0 is a hypersurface in a holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath2 , as in the previous subsection , and let @xmath15 be the characteristic foliation on @xmath0 .",
    "since the canonical bundle @xmath76 of @xmath2 is trivial , we have @xmath77 by adjunction .",
    "let @xmath16 be a curve which lies in the smooth locus of @xmath0 ; then @xmath78 so if @xmath79 is ample then @xmath17 will be anti - ample and the hypotheses of the theorem can never be satisfied .",
    "the following conjecture was suggested by jun ",
    "muk hwang .",
    "is ample , then @xmath80 is ample and @xmath0 is of general type .",
    "their proof involves a global tale version of reeb stability ( theorem  3.2 in  @xcite ) ; in the context of our argument here , this essentially says that there is a generically finite cover @xmath81 of @xmath0 such that when we pull back the foliation to @xmath81 the genus of the leaves becomes constant . ]    let @xmath0 be a smooth hypersurface in an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath2 such that @xmath79 is ample",
    ". then the characteristic foliation on @xmath0 can not be such that all of its leaves are algebraic .",
    "certainly some of the leaves of the foliation could be algebraic .",
    "let the algebraic curve @xmath82 be a leaf of the foliation @xmath15 .",
    "then the tangent bundle of @xmath16 @xmath83 is anti - ample and @xmath16 must have genus @xmath84 .",
    "suppose that every leaf is a ( smooth ) genus @xmath85 curve , and indeed that @xmath0 is a fibration by genus @xmath85 curves over the base @xmath86 , i.e. , with no singular fibres .",
    "the homotopy long exact sequence of @xmath87 gives @xmath88 since @xmath79 is ample and the irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath2 is simply - connected , @xmath0 must have trivial fundamental group by the lefschetz hyperplane theorem ; but then @xmath89 will be the cokernel of the map @xmath90 between abelian groups , forcing @xmath89 itself to be abelian .",
    "this gives a contradiction .",
    "the statement of the conjecture is of course stronger than this because even if all the leaves of @xmath15 are algebraic , we can not expect @xmath0 to be fibred by genus @xmath85 curves : the genus could drop on closed subsets .",
    "the local example @xmath91 illustrates this , where @xmath16 is a curve admitting a fixed - point free involution @xmath92 , and @xmath93 acts as @xmath92 on @xmath16 and multiplication by @xmath94 on @xmath95 . here",
    "the central fibre is isomorphic to @xmath96 and it has smaller genus .    returning to theorem  [ kebekus ] , it is clear that we must start with a hypersurface @xmath0 whose corresponding line bundle @xmath79 is negative in some sense , in order to apply this result . let us assume that this is the case , and that the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied .",
    "if furthermore @xmath0 is smooth then @xmath15 is regular everywhere , and every leaf is rationally connected .",
    "since the leaves are one - dimensional and smooth , they must be rational curves @xmath22 ; the space of leaves will then be particularly well - behaved .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a smooth hypersurface such that all of the leaves of the characteristic foliation @xmath15 are rational curves .",
    "then the space of leaves , denoted @xmath4 , is smooth .",
    "holmann  @xcite proved that if all of the leaves of a holomorphic foliation on a khler manifold are compact , then the foliation is stable , meaning that every open neighbourhood of a leaf @xmath97 contains a neighbourhood consisting of a union of leaves ( known as a saturated neighbourhood ) .",
    "stability of the foliation is equivalent to the space of leaves @xmath4 being hausdorff .",
    "let us describe the local structure of the space of leaves @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a ( compact ) leaf of @xmath15 , represented by a point in @xmath4 .",
    "take a small slice @xmath98 in @xmath0 transverse to the foliation , with @xmath97 intersecting @xmath98 at a point @xmath99 .",
    "the holonomy map is a group homomorphism from the fundamental group of @xmath97 to the group of automorphisms of @xmath98 which fix @xmath100 .",
    "the holonomy group @xmath101 of @xmath97 is the image of the holonomy map .",
    "then @xmath102 is a local model for the space of leaves @xmath4 in a neighbourhood of the point representing @xmath97 ( see holmann  @xcite for details ) .",
    "globally , the space of leaves @xmath4 is constructed by patching together these local models .",
    "if all of the leaves are rational curves , then they are simply connected and hence the holonomy groups must be trivial .",
    "the local models for @xmath4 are therefore simply the transverse slices @xmath98 ; in particular , they are smooth .",
    "note that @xmath0 is a @xmath22-bundle over the space of leaves @xmath4 .",
    "this is really a holomorphic version of the reeb stability theorem , in the case when the leaves are smooth and simply connected .",
    "by contrast , a real foliation with leaves isomorphic to @xmath7 need not be an @xmath7-bundle as some leaves could have multiplicity ( e.g. a seifert - fibred space with exceptional fibres ; sometimes this is regarded as an @xmath7-bundle over an orbifold ) . similarly , a holomorphic foliation with leaves isomorphic to elliptic curves could have multiple fibres . in a different direction ,",
    "if we assume the leaves are simply connected but not necessarily smooth ( i.e. , if the foliation is not regular ) , then chains of @xmath22s could occur .",
    "the space of leaves @xmath4 could also be defined in terms of the chow variety of subvarieties of @xmath0 , or in terms of the hilbert scheme of subschemes of @xmath0 ; in either case , we take the irreducible component which contains the generic leaf .",
    "when all of the leaves are rational curves , these constructions of @xmath4 all yield isomorphic spaces .    the situation becomes somewhat more complicated when @xmath0 is a hypersurface with singularities . in this case , the foliation @xmath15 is regular along the smooth locus @xmath52 of @xmath0 , but not regular along the singular locus @xmath103 of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is perhaps better to consider the foliation only over @xmath52 ; a leaf could then be quasi - projective , i.e. , it could be algebraic but we would need to add a point or points from @xmath103 to compactify it .    defining the space of leaves is also more delicate .",
    "one approach is to think of the foliation as an equivalence relation on @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is smooth the equivalence classes are simply the leaves , and this leads to the local models for @xmath4 described earlier .",
    "when @xmath0 is singular we should take closures of leaves , and moreover , if two closures intersect we should consider them part of the same equivalence class .",
    "thus an equivalence class could consist of a chain of @xmath22s .",
    "such a construction is similar to mumford s geometric invariant theory : if a group @xmath104 acts on a space @xmath2 , then two points are equivalent if the closures of their orbits under @xmath104 intersect .",
    "one problem with this approach is that a continuous family of leaves in @xmath52 could all be compactified by the same point from @xmath103 ; this then produces an equivalence class of dimension greater than one , which may be undesirable .",
    "we could instead define the space of leaves in terms of the chow variety or hilbert scheme .",
    "we can not guarantee that these different approaches will yield the same space @xmath4 , but when the generic leaf is a smooth curve then these various spaces should at least be birational .",
    "certainly we do nt expect @xmath4 to be smooth in general : it will usually be singular along points parametrizing leaves which intersect @xmath103 .",
    "it is somewhat easier to deal with the case of a higher codimension submanifold @xmath0 , provided @xmath0 is coisotropic so that the characteristic foliation @xmath15 is regular .",
    "firstly , the leaves must be smooth .",
    "if the hypotheses of theorem  [ kebekus ] are satisfied , then all the leaves must be algebraic ( hence compact ) and rationally connected .",
    "it is well known that smooth rationally connected varieties are simply connected ( see corollary 4.18 of debarre  @xcite , for example ) , and therefore we obtain a smooth space of leaves @xmath4 just as in the proof of the lemma above ( i.e. , all holonomy groups are trivial so the local models must be smooth ) .",
    "we conclude this subsection with the following result about the structure of the space of leaves @xmath4 .",
    "assume that the space of leaves @xmath4 is smooth ( for example , @xmath0 is a smooth hypersurface or a coisotropic submanifold and the hypotheses of theorem  [ kebekus ] are satisfied ) .",
    "then @xmath4 admits a holomorphic symplectic form .    intuitively , by taking the space of leaves we are quotienting along the leaves of @xmath15 , which are the null directions of @xmath3",
    ". therefore @xmath3 should descend to a non - degenerate two - form on @xmath4 . to make this rigourous",
    ", we will define holomorphic symplectic forms on the local models for @xmath4 and then prove that they agree when the local models are patched together .    a local model for the space of leaves @xmath4 in a neighbourhood of the point representing the leaf @xmath97 is given by a small slice @xmath105 in @xmath0 , with @xmath97 intersecting @xmath105 transversally at a point @xmath100 . in a neighbourhood of @xmath100 , @xmath105 will be transverse to the foliation @xmath15 and therefore the restriction @xmath106 will be a non - degenerate two - form .",
    "suppose @xmath107 is a second small slice transverse to @xmath97 ; the intersections points @xmath108 and @xmath109 may or may not coincide . shrinking @xmath105 and @xmath107 if necessary",

    "this map is well - defined because the leaves are simply connected , and it takes the point @xmath100 in @xmath105 ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) to @xmath100 in @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) .",
    "this makes explicit the method of patching together local models ; see figure  1 .",
    ", width=151 ]    now @xmath115 could be regarded as the time @xmath116 map of a flow @xmath117 associated to a vector field @xmath48 along the leaves of the foliation @xmath15 . since @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the lie derivative @xmath120 vanishes , and therefore the flow @xmath117 will preserve the holomorphic two - form @xmath3 .",
    "in particular @xmath121 which completes the proof .",
    "in general , the same proof shows that there is always a holomorphic symplectic form on the smooth part of the space of leaves @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath102 is a local model for @xmath4 near a leaf @xmath97 with non - trivial holonomy group @xmath101 ( in particular , @xmath97 itself can not be simply connected ) , then @xmath101 should be a subgroup of the symplectomorphism group of @xmath98 , i.e. , the group of automorphisms preserving the symplectic structure on @xmath98 . the simplest case would be when @xmath101 is a finite group ; @xmath102 is then a symplectic singularity , which may admit a symplectic desingularization .",
    "more generally , foliations can behave very wildly and in principle @xmath101 could be infinite .",
    "assume now that @xmath2 is a four - fold , and @xmath0 is a hypersurface , not necessarily smooth or even normal , with @xmath15 the characteristic foliation on @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the hypotheses of theorem  [ kebekus ] are satisfied , i.e. , there is a curve @xmath16 lying in the smooth locus @xmath52 of @xmath0 for which @xmath17 is ample .",
    "recall that @xmath15 is locally free of rank one on @xmath52 , and @xmath122 over @xmath52 .",
    "therefore @xmath17 ample will imply @xmath123 , and the divisor @xmath0 on @xmath2 is not nef .",
    "let us begin instead with the assumption @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the beauville - bogomolov quadratic form of @xmath2 .",
    "this will imply the existence of a curve @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is ample , as we now explain .",
    "a nef divisor @xmath126 is the limit of ample divisors , and so it must satisfy @xmath127 since @xmath128 for ample @xmath129 .",
    "so if @xmath0 is not in @xmath130 ( which contains the nef cone ) then @xmath0 can not be nef .",
    "it follows that there must exist a curve @xmath16 such that @xmath123 , or in other words , such that @xmath17 is ample .",
    "note that if @xmath0 is singular the curve @xmath16 wo nt necessarily lie in the smooth locus @xmath52 , but this is not important for the following discussion .",
    "we can now run the log minimal model programme ( mmp ) on @xmath131 , where @xmath132 .",
    "the goal is to reach a particular birational model for @xmath131 after a series of directed flips .",
    "in fact it is known that birational maps between holomorphic symplectic four - folds factor through mukai flops , i.e. , blowing up a @xmath26 and then blowing it down along a different ruling of the exceptional divisor ( this was proved by burns , hu , and luo  @xcite provided the indeterminacy of the map is normal , but this hypothesis can be removed because of a later result of wierzba and winiewski  @xcite ) . note that a mukai flop with respect to the trivial canonical bundle @xmath76 is a directed flip with respect to @xmath133 .",
    "almost all parts of the log mmp have been proved in dimension four .",
    "the existence of log flips is due to shokurov  @xcite . while termination is not yet established in full generality ,",
    "there are many partial results : kawamata , matsuda , and matsuki  @xcite proved termination for terminal flips , matsuki  @xcite proved termination for terminal flops , fujino  @xcite proved termination for canonical log flips , and alexeev , hacon , and kawamata  @xcite proved termination for klt log flips under some additional hypotheses ( see also corti et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in our case @xmath131 will be a canonical pair for sufficiently small @xmath134 , since @xmath2 is smooth ; we can therefore apply fujino s result .",
    "the conclusion is that after finitely many flips we get @xmath135 which , a priori , satisfies one of the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath136 is a mori fibre space , 2 .",
    "@xmath137 is nef , 3 .",
    "@xmath135 admits a divisorial contraction @xmath138    in the first case @xmath139 should be negative on all the fibres , which is impossible since @xmath140 is trivial and @xmath137 is effective .",
    "next consider case two . by assumption @xmath141 ; but then @xmath142 since this value is preserved under a mukai flop .",
    "thus @xmath137 can not be nef either , and case two is impossible .",

    "this involves proving the following statements :    * @xmath483 ( this was proved by matsushita  @xcite ) , * @xmath484 ( the isomorphism is clear over @xmath485 , and can be extended over the discriminant locus @xmath20 ) , * @xmath486 ( from restricting the previous isomorphisms to @xmath487 ) , * @xmath488 , @xmath489 , and @xmath490 ( from substituting the previous isomorphism into the leray spectral sequence for @xmath491 ) .    therefore if @xmath449 were a minimal surface , it s kodaira dimension would be least zero . however , we can also prove the following :    * if @xmath2 is an irreducible holomorphic symplectic four - fold then the characteristic number @xmath492 $ ] is at least @xmath493 ( this follows from guan s bounds  @xcite on the characteristic numbers of holomorphic symplectic four - folds ) , * @xmath494)^{1/2}$ ] ( as proved by the author in  @xcite ) , * @xmath495 and hence @xmath496 has at least @xmath497 singular fibres ( this follows from the previous two points ) , * @xmath498 and @xmath499 ( follows from the previous inequality and noether s formula ) .",
    "thus if @xmath449 were a minimal surface , it s kodaira dimension would be @xmath500 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath449 is not minimal , establishing the claim .",
    "we have shown that for each @xmath487 the surface @xmath501 contains at least one @xmath482-curve .",
    "next we show that these @xmath482-curves are leaves of the foliation on @xmath0 .",
    "denoting one of these curves by @xmath502 , consider the following combination of short exact sequences : @xmath503 we can identify @xmath504 , @xmath505 since @xmath16 is a @xmath482-curve in @xmath449 , @xmath506 where @xmath13 is the degree of the projection map @xmath507 , and @xmath508 where @xmath509 . substituting these into the exact sequence ,",
    "one deduces that we must have @xmath510 and the map @xmath511 must lift to an isomorphism @xmath512 . in other words",
    ", @xmath16 is a leaf of the characteristic foliation on @xmath0 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath66 , so that @xmath16 is a section of @xmath496 .",
    "thus we obtain a space of leaves @xmath431 which is a smooth surface admitting a holomorphic symplectic structure , i.e. , a k3 or abelian surface .",
    "a leaf of the foliation will intersect each curve @xmath282 in @xmath476 at most once since the leaf is a section of @xmath496 ; moreover , one can show that an intersection must be transverse .",
    "therefore each curve @xmath282 maps isomorphically to its image in @xmath19 under the projection @xmath513 . since @xmath19 contains a @xmath436-dimensional linear system of genus two curves , it is a k3 surface , and this completes the proof .",
    "the advantage of this proof is that it can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "first we need an appropriate generalization of a family of curves with mild degenerations .",
    "let @xmath30 be a flat family of genus @xmath31 curves .",
    "if @xmath282 is a singular curve of this family with isolated singular points @xmath514 then each singular point has a versal deformation space @xmath515 and there is an induced map",
    "@xmath516 we say that the family has mild singularities if    1 .",
    "every curve in the family is reduced and irreducible , 2 .",
    "@xmath117 is surjective for every singular curve @xmath282 in the family .",
    "it follows from these conditions that the total space of @xmath30 is smooth ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , smoothness of @xmath27 is a sufficient hypothesis for the following theorem .",
    "( sawon  @xcite ) [ main ] let @xmath30 be a family of genus @xmath31 curves with mild singularities .",
    "if @xmath517 is a holomorphic symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath1 and the degree of the discriminant locus @xmath35 is greater than @xmath518 then @xmath2 is a beauville - mukai integrable system , i.e. , the family of curves is a complete linear system of curves in a k3 surface @xmath19 . in particular , @xmath2 is a deformation of the hilbert scheme @xmath33 .",
    "the main ideas of the proof are the same as the one above , though some steps are a little more complicated .",
    "we outline them here ; full details may be found in  @xcite .    as before ,",
    "the relative abel - jacobi embedding @xmath519 gives a submanifold @xmath9 of dimension @xmath520 .",
    "although @xmath0 is smooth , we do nt know a priori whether it is coisotropic .",
    "however , we will show later that the rank of the restriction @xmath3 is constant , so that the characteristic foliation @xmath15 is regular and @xmath0 is coisotropic .",
    "again we look for rational curves in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath478 be a generic line in the base @xmath32 and let @xmath521 .",
    "as before , we can show that @xmath488 , @xmath489 , and @xmath490 .",
    "we also have @xmath522 and @xmath523 ; this is where we use the bound on the degree of the discriminant locus .",
    "as before , we conclude that @xmath449 is _ not _ minimal , i.e. , it contains at least one @xmath482-curve .",
    "again we analyze the combination of short exact sequences : @xmath503 we can show that for a generic @xmath482-curve @xmath16 , the restriction @xmath17 will be locally free . then analyzing the above sequences as before reveals that @xmath524 in particular @xmath15 has rank @xmath322 at a generic point of @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath3 has rank two at a generic point ; but then it must have rank two everywhere since the rank can only drop on closed subsets and two is the minimal value .",
    "therefore @xmath15 is locally free , and @xmath0 is coisotropic .    to complete the proof ,",
    "we show that each @xmath482-curve @xmath16 is a section of @xmath496 .",
    "of course @xmath16 lies in a leaf of the foliation @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , by considering the normal bundle of @xmath16 inside the leaf , we can show that each leaf maps isomorphically to a hyperplane in @xmath32 under the projection @xmath525 .",
    "so the leaves are @xmath336s , and @xmath0 is a @xmath336-bundle over the space of leaves @xmath431 . as before",
    ", @xmath19 is a smooth surface admitting a holomorphic symplectic form .",
    "the curves @xmath282 in the family @xmath476 map isomorphically to their images under the projection @xmath526 . since @xmath19 contains an @xmath31-dimensional linear system of genus @xmath31 curves , it is a k3 surface , and this completes the proof .",
    "in  @xcite ogrady constructed a new ten - dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifold by desingularizing a certain moduli space of semi - stable sheaves on a k3 surface @xmath19 . in this section",
    "we show that for certain choices of the k3 surface @xmath19 , ogrady s example is birational to the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation on a hypersurface in the twelve - dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath18 .",

    "let @xmath529 be the compactification given by adding ( @xmath19-equivalence classes of ) semi - stable sheaves ; note that @xmath529 is singular along the locus of strictly semi - stable sheaves",
    ". then @xmath529 can be desingularized by a sequence of blow - ups and blow - downs , such that the resulting space @xmath530 is a smooth holomorphic symplectic manifold of dimension ten .",
    "we start by describing how ogrady s example for a special choice of k3 surface is birational to a lagrangian fibration .",
    "let @xmath19 be a k3 surface which is a double cover of the plane , branched over a generic sextic .",
    "then ogrady s space @xmath530 is birational to a lagrangian fibration .",
    "the birational map to a lagrangian fibration was first discovered by ogrady himself ; rapagnetta later showed that we can assume the lagrangian fibration is smooth .",
    "let @xmath129 be the polarization of @xmath19 given by the pull - back of a line in the plane ; since @xmath19 is a generic branched cover of the plane , we can assume that @xmath276 is generated by @xmath129 .",
    "consider the linear system @xmath531 on @xmath19 , whose generic element is a smooth genus five curve .",
    "denote this family of curves by @xmath532 .",
    "denote by @xmath533 the degree six compactified relative jacobian of @xmath534 . since @xmath535 contains both reducible curves ( the pull - back of a pair of lines in the plane ) and non - reduced curves ( the pull - back of a double line ) , we _ define _ @xmath533 to be the irreducible component of the mukai moduli space of semi - stable sheaves on @xmath19 which contains @xmath412 , where @xmath413 is the inclusion of a generic curve of the linear system into @xmath19 and @xmath97 is a degree six line bundle on @xmath16 . in other words @xmath536 note that this space is singular as the mukai vector @xmath537 is _ not _ primitive .",
    "it can be shown that for generic @xmath16 and @xmath97 , @xmath538 and @xmath97 is globally generated .",
    "then we can define a sheaf @xmath348 as the kernel of the evaluation map @xmath539 and it turns out that @xmath540 is a stable sheaf with mukai vector @xmath541 .",
    "this induces a birational map @xmath542 where the space on the left is a lagrangian fibration over @xmath531 .",
    "moreover , rapagnetta  @xcite proved that @xmath533 can be desingularized by using the same sequence of blow - ups and blow - downs as ogrady used to desingularize @xmath529 .",
    "this produces a smooth lagrangian fibration which is birational to ogrady s space .",
    "we complete this section by using the lagrangian fibration to show the following result .",
    "let @xmath19 be a k3 surface which is a double cover of the plane , branched over a generic sextic .",
    "then ogrady s space @xmath530 is birational to the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation on a hypersurface in @xmath18 .",
    "it suffices to work with the singular space @xmath533 instead of ogrady s space @xmath530 , since they are birational . as mentioned earlier , if @xmath412 is a generic element of @xmath533 , with @xmath97 a degree six line bundle on a curve @xmath543 , then @xmath538 .",
    "a non - trivial section of @xmath97 vanishes at six points of @xmath327 , counted with multiplicity , and therefore defines an element of @xmath18 .",
    "note that this works even if there is some repetition among the six points : for example , if @xmath544 and the other points are distinct then the length six zero - dimensional subscheme is given by the four points @xmath545 plus @xmath546 , where @xmath547 is any non - zero vector in @xmath548 .",
    "moreover , for generic @xmath97 we wo nt encounter vanishing to multiplicity greater than two . of course ,",
    "two sections which agree up to scale will result in the same element of @xmath18 .",
    "thus we get a family of elements of @xmath18 parametrized by @xmath549 .",
    "we have shown that an open subset of @xmath550 parametrizes a family of rational curves in @xmath18 .",
    "the closure of the locus swept out by this family of curves is a hypersurface @xmath0 in @xmath18 .",
    "this hypersurface can also be defined by @xmath551 i.e. , @xmath0 consists of those length six zero - dimensional subschemes of @xmath19 which lie on a curve in the linear system @xmath535 . to see that this defines a hypersurface , note that if we project six points in @xmath19 down to the plane then the condition that they lie on a conic , and hence that the original six points lie on a curve in @xmath535 , is codimension one .",
    "a generic element @xmath429 will lie on precisely one curve @xmath16 in the linear system @xmath535 , and the rational map @xmath552 is given by mapping @xmath234 to the degree six divisor on @xmath16 which it defines .",
    "the fibres of this map are the rational curves in @xmath18 described earlier , and these are the generic leaves of the characteristic foliation @xmath15 on @xmath0 .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath533 is birational to the space of leaves @xmath4 , and this completes the proof .",
    "it is not clear whether the space of leaves @xmath4 is smooth , though this would seem unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that it admits a simpler symplectic desingularization than @xmath529 ; this would give a more direct route to constructing ogrady s space .",
    "in this final section we explain how the existence or non - existence of compact leaves of the characteristic foliation @xmath15 on the hypersurface @xmath0 can be regarded as a holomorphic analogue of the weinstein conjecture from ( real ) symplectic geometry .",
    "first we recall the weinstein conjecture  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath553 be a ( real ) symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath1 , let @xmath129 be a smooth function on @xmath554 , and let @xmath555 be the corresponding hamiltonian vector field , which is defined by @xmath556 for @xmath557 .",
    "since @xmath558 the vector field @xmath555 preserves the level sets of @xmath129 .",
    "assume that @xmath559 is chosen so that the level set @xmath560 is compact .",
    "a fundamental question is : will the vector field @xmath555 have a periodic orbit on @xmath560 ?",

    "the weinstein conjecture  @xcite states that there is always a periodic orbit if @xmath560 is of _ contact type_. the latter means that @xmath568 restricted to @xmath560 is exact and equal to @xmath569 , where @xmath182 is a contact form on @xmath560 , i.e. , @xmath570 . an equivalent definition is as follows : @xmath560 is of contact type if there exists a liouville vector field @xmath571 on an open neighbourhood @xmath572 of @xmath560 in @xmath554 , i.e. , a vector field @xmath48 whose lie derivative preserves the symplectic form , @xmath573 . the corresponding flow @xmath574 will rescale the symplectic form by an exponential , @xmath575 .",
    "the weinstein conjecture was proved for @xmath576 by viterbo  @xcite .",
    "next we explain how this relates to characteristic foliations on hypersurfaces .",
    "since @xmath577 , when restricted to the level set @xmath560 we find that @xmath578 is identically zero .",
    "in other words , @xmath555 generates the characteristic foliation on @xmath560 ; a periodic orbit of @xmath555 is precisely a compact leaf of the foliation .    in the holomorphic case",
    "there are no non - constant functions on a compact complex manifold @xmath2 .",
    "instead the hypersurface @xmath0 can be regarded as @xmath579 where @xmath424 is a section of the corresponding line bundle @xmath79 .",
    "locally we can take @xmath580 to be the first coordinate in a system of darboux coordinates , in which case the characteristic foliation @xmath15 is generated locally by @xmath57 , which is also the holomorphic analogue of the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to @xmath424 .",
    "globally everything needs to be twisted by a power of the line bundle @xmath79 .",
    "the analogue of a periodic orbit isomorphic to @xmath7 is a compact leaf isomorphic to @xmath22 .",
    "as we have seen , the reeb stability theorem guarantees that nearby leaves will also be rational curves , because @xmath22 is simply - connected .",
    "this is in contrast to the real case , where a periodic orbit is not simply - connected and so isolated periodic orbits can exist .",
    "an example is the generic ellipsoid described above , which has finitely many periodic orbits .    in the holomorphic case , the contact form @xmath581 on",
    "the hypersurface @xmath0 also needs to be twisted by a line bundle @xmath97 ; thus @xmath582 and since @xmath583 should be non - vanishing , we must have @xmath584 .",
