    "on the other hand , we may mention richardson s cascade picture of fully - developed fluid turbulence as a successful example of capturing the essence of a strongly correlated system , which stated that large eddies gradually fragment into smaller eddies , and eventually dissipate due to viscosity .",
    "apart from the difficult problem of intermittency , this picture was mathematically formulated into the kolmogorov 1941 theory , which gave the famous @xmath1 energy spectrum [ frisch , 1995 ] .",
    "this success was due to the fact that in fluid turbulence , fortunately , a simple hierarchy in spatial scale ( or equivalently , in temporal / energy scales ) is formed as a result of complex nonlinear dynamics of a number of modes . since the success in fluid turbulence",
    ", attempts have been made to capture the dynamics of other kinds of many - body systems such as spatio - temporal chaos [ ikeda & matsumoto , 1989 ] , chaotic systems with large degrees of freedom [ kaneko , 1994 ] , and stock markets [ arnodo _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998a ] , based on the picture that energy , or more generally information or causality , flows from scales to scales .",
    "in analyzing space - scale properties of various kinds of signals , the wavelet transform is expected to be a useful tool due to its localized nature both in space and scale , and many applications have been made [ mallat , 1999 ] . of course , there are many studies that tried to capture the cascade process of fully - developed turbulence directly using wavelets [ argoul _ et al .",
    "_ , 1989 ; yamada & ohkitani , 1991 ; arnodo _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998b ] .",
    "but most of the studies treated one - dimensional time sequences of the velocity field measured at a single point in fluid , and rather a limited number of studies actually investigated the temporal evolution of correlation between scales of spatially extended fields [ toh , 1995 ] . in this paper , we propose a simple visualization method of such spatio - temporal correlation between scales of spatially extended fields using wavelets , and apply it to two typical spatio - temporally chaotic systems .",
    "as such chaotic systems , we investigate ordinary diffusively coupled complex ginzburg - landau oscillators [ kuramoto , 1984 ; bohr _ et al . _ ,",
    "1998 ] and somewhat unusual non - locally coupled complex ginzburg - landau oscillators [ kuramoto , 1995 ] .",
    "while the former system exhibits spatially smooth amplitude patterns , the latter system exhibits fractal spatial patterns .",
    "therefore , the dynamical processes behind those systems are expected to differ from each other significantly , and it is interesting to see whether their difference can be detected by our method or not .",
    "the ordinary diffusively ( i.e. , locally ) coupled complex ginzburg - landau equation [ kuramoto , 1984 ; bohr _ et al . _ ,",
    "1998 ] is given by @xmath2 which can be derived , for example , from equations of oscillatory media in the vicinity of their hopf bifurcation points by the center - manifold reduction technique .",
    "here , @xmath3 is a complex amplitude of an oscillator at position @xmath4 and at time @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are real parameters , and @xmath8 is a diffusion constant .",
    "it is well known that this equation exhibits spatio - temporal chaos in some appropriate parameter region .",
    "we call this equation `` lcgl equation '' hereafter .    in this paper , we treat only spatially one - dimensional cases .",
    "we fix the length of the system at @xmath9 , and assume a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the diffusion constant is set at @xmath10 , and the parameters are fixed at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . with these values ,",
    "the spatially uniform solution of the lcgl equation is unstable , and the system exhibits spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "typical time scale of the system is roughly estimated as the time needed for an uncoupled free oscillator to go around its limit cycle , and is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the numerical simulation was done in wavenumber space using @xmath14 modes by the pseudo - spectral method with a time step of @xmath15 ( euler integration ) .",
    "due to the existence of a diffusion term , the solution of the lcgl equation necessarily possesses a characteristic minimal length scale , below which fluctuations are strongly depressed .",
    "thus , the amplitude pattern @xmath16 of the solution has a smoothly modulated shape as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] .",
    "the shortest wavelength determined by the diffusion constant is about @xmath17 . for the sake of comparison",
    ", this value is equated with the coupling length of the non - locally coupled system that we explain later .",
    "figure  [ fig:02 ] displays temporal evolution of the amplitude pattern , and fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] shows its power spectrum . since short - wavelength components are strongly depressed",
    ", the power spectrum decays exponentially .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4    = 0.4    as another spatio - temporally chaotic system , we investigate a different type of coupled complex ginzburg - landau oscillators , which was first introduced by kuramoto [ 1995 ] . instead of a diffusive interaction , it has a non - local interaction ; each oscillator feels a non - local mean field of other oscillators through a kernel @xmath18 , which is a decreasing function of @xmath19 .",
    "hereafter we use @xmath20 as the kernel , where @xmath21 gives the coupling range .",
    "@xmath22 is some appropriate normalization constant , and assumed to be @xmath23 .",
    "the equation for this system of non - locally coupled oscillators is given by @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we call `` ncgl equation '' hereafter .",
    "this equation can be derived , for example , from a model of oscillatory biological cells that are interacting through some diffusive chemical substance with a finite decay rate .",
    "although the difference between this ncgl equation and the lcgl equation is only the last interaction term , it was shown that this ncgl equation exhibits spatio - temporal chaos with remarkably different features from the lcgl equation , such as fractal amplitude patterns , power - law spatial correlation , and power - law spectrum .",
    "we again fix the length of the system at @xmath9 , and assume a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the coupling range is fixed at @xmath25 , which is equal to the shortest characteristic length @xmath26 of the lcgl equation .",
    "( more precisely , by assuming the smoothness of the amplitude field @xmath27 in the interaction term and expanding it up to the second order in @xmath28 around @xmath4 , we obtain an effective diffusion constant @xmath29 for the ncgl equation .",
    "however , the smoothness of the amplitude field is not always guaranteed , hence this correspondence is only formal . )",
    "the parameter values are again set at @xmath30 and @xmath31 . with these values ,",
    "the uniform solution of the system is always unstable , and the system behaves in a chaotic manner .",
    "further , the behavior of the system strongly depends on the remaining coupling strength @xmath32 ; the amplitude pattern of the system is smooth for large @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , while almost discontinuous for small @xmath32 ( @xmath34 ) . between these values , there exists a parameter region where the amplitude pattern is fractal , and its spatial correlation exhibits power - law behavior .",
    "we fix @xmath35 hereafter , where the system is exactly in this `` anomalous '' spatio - temporally chaotic regime .",
    "the numerical simulation was done in real space using @xmath14 oscillators by the 4th - order runge - kutta method with a time step of @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig:04 ] displays a typical snapshot of the solution of the ncgl equation , and fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] shows its temporal evolution .",
    "in contrast to the case of the lcgl equation , the amplitude pattern is not completely smooth , but is composed of patches of smooth coherent regions and strongly disordered regions . the power spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] also indicates the difference clearly .",
    "it exhibits power - law decay rather than the exponential decay in the case of the lcgl equation , which implies the strong anomaly of the amplitude field .",
    "actually , it was shown that the amplitude pattern of the ncgl equation is fractal , and its fractal dimension varies with the coupling strength @xmath32 .",
    "these properties are essentially the results of the absence of length scale shorter than the coupling range @xmath21 , and can be explained using a simple multiplicative stochastic model to a certain extent [ kuramoto & nakao , 1996 ] .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4    = 0.4    thus , the difference in the interaction term greatly changes the amplitude pattern of the system , even though the oscillators and characteristic length scales are the same .",
    "especially , the power - law behavior of the power spectrum reminds us of the @xmath1 energy spectrum of fluid turbulence .",
    "( however , the exponent changes with the coupling strength @xmath32 for our ncgl equation . )",
    "the power - law behavior of the energy spectrum in fluid turbulence is related to the cascade process of breakdown of vortices .",
    "thus , we may naively expect that our ncgl equation also possesses some kind of cascade process .",
    "of course , the ncgl equation is strongly dissipative and there is no such conservative quantity like energy or enstrophy .",
    "however , we still expect a cascade process of some quantity from long - wavelength components to shorter - wavelength components , which may be called causality or information , or merely correlation .",
    "in the following part of this paper , we develop a simple method to visualize the spatio - temporal correlation between fluctuations at different scales , in order to prove the existence of such cascade process .",
    "let us consider decomposing the spatial pattern into various scales using wavelets , and analyzing the temporal correlation between them .",
    "we decompose a spatial pattern @xmath37 using an orthonormal wavelet basis as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an expansion coefficient , and @xmath40 is a child wavelet generated from the mother wavelet @xmath41 by translation and dilation as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a scale parameter , and @xmath44 is a translation parameter .",
    "the child wavelets are mutually orthogonal as @xmath45 and form a complete orthonormal set . since the child wavelet @xmath40 is localized both in space and scale roughly at position @xmath46 and scale @xmath47 , the expansion coefficient given by @xmath48 quantifies the magnitude of fluctuation of @xmath37 around this space - scale point .",
    "hereafter we use meyer s wavelet .",
    "it is a real analytic function that decays faster than any power function as @xmath49 , and its moment of any order vanishes , i.e. , @xmath50 further , it has a smooth fourier transform with a compact support .",
    "these features are very preferable from the viewpoint of physicists . for the details of meyer",
    "s wavelet and efficient numerical algorism , see refs .",
    "[ yamada & ohkitani , 1991 ; mallat , 1999 ] .",
    "meyer s mother wavelet and one of its child wavelet are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] .",
    "= 0.4    in the practical numerical calculation , the amplitude pattern is a periodic function on @xmath51 represented by @xmath52 discrete points .",
    "therefore , we extend the pattern over the whole real axis by a periodic extrapolation in order to apply the wavelet transform . consequently , in the actual numerical calculation , the first subscript @xmath43 in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : waveletdecomposition ] ) indicating the scale runs from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , and the second subscript @xmath44 indicating the translation runs from @xmath53 to @xmath55 .    rather than using the obtained expansion coefficient directly ,",
    "we define a new coarse - grained field @xmath56 by a piecewise constant interpolation from the expansion coefficient @xmath39 as @xmath57 here we take a square of the coefficient , because we are interested in the absolute intensity of the fluctuation at a certain position and scale .",
    "further taking the logarithm is merely for convenience sake here ; we obtain similar results without taking the logarithm .",
    "however , there also exists some discussion claiming that taking the logarithm is more appropriate when the system under consideration possesses a random multiplicative process [ arnodo _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998a ; arnodo _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998b ] , and the ncgl equation is actually considered this case .",
    "figures  [ fig:08 ] and [ fig:09 ] display the coarse - grained fields @xmath58 for the lcgl and ncgl equations .",
    "the obtained data for the lcgl equation are very noisy for large @xmath43 values , since components whose wavelengths are shorter than the dissipation scale @xmath59 decay very quickly . on the other hand",
    ", we can observe clear positional correlation between scales down to a very small wavelength in the case of the ncgl equation .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4    let @xmath60 be the amplitude pattern at time @xmath5 , i.e. , latexmath:[$v_1(x ) =    from @xmath60 for a period of @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 . from these amplitude patterns ,",
    "we obtain coarse - grained fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 at scales @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we then define deviations of these fields from their mean values as @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant - valued function @xmath71 , and the inner product of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 now we define a kind of cross - correlation matrix @xmath75 from these @xmath76 and @xmath77 as @xmath78^{1/2 }    } .\\ ] ] from this definition , @xmath79 obviously follows .",
    "the overlines in the above equations indicate temporal average , assuming the stationarity of the spatio - temporal chaos under consideration .    when @xmath80 , @xmath81 represents the same amplitude pattern as @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath76 and @xmath77 are identical , and @xmath82 is merely a symmetric matrix . when @xmath83 , @xmath81 differs from @xmath60 to some degree depending on @xmath62 .",
    "therefore @xmath82 is no longer symmetric , and its asymmetry is expected to characterize the variation of spatio - temporal correlation between scales . in order to see this asymmetry clearly , let us decompose the matrix @xmath82 into symmetric and antisymmetric parts as @xmath84 and @xmath85 the symmetric part @xmath86 is invariant under time - reversal transform @xmath87 , while the antisymmetric part @xmath88 is not invariant ( antisymmetric ) .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath88 is expected to quantify the variation of spatio - temporal correlation between scales that is not symmetric to time - reversal , namely , to give a certain measure of the flow of information or correlation between scales .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , the symmetric part @xmath86 and the antisymmetric part @xmath88 of the correlation matrix obtained for the lcgl equation are displayed using color codes for several values of the time difference @xmath62 .",

    "the vertical axis of each graph represents the scale @xmath66 of the pattern at the reference time , and the horizontal axis represents the scale @xmath67 of the pattern @xmath62 after the reference time .",
    "first , for @xmath90 , the antisymmetric part is merely zero and only the symmetric part takes positive values .",
    "the diagonal components naturally take largest values , since the self - correlation of the fluctuation at the same scale is strongest . besides",
    ", it can be seen that there exists rather strong correlation between adjacent scales in the dissipation region determined by the diffusion constant @xmath8 ( the region with the scale slightly smaller than @xmath91 ) .",
    "when the time difference @xmath62 becomes a little larger , the symmetric part diminishes .",
    "but still the diagonal components and the dissipation region maintain higher correlations than the others .",
    "now , if we look at the antisymmetric part , there appear small localized regions in the neighborhood of the dissipation region across the diagonal , which have negative and positive correlations , respectively .",
    "this implies that fluctuation at a certain scale at the reference time ( vertical axis ) possesses relatively strong correlation to fluctuation at slightly smaller scale @xmath62 after the reference time ( horizontal axis ) . in this case , it can be considered as visualizing the dissipation due to the diffusion term . as the time difference @xmath62 becomes further large ,",
    "both the symmetric and antisymmetric parts tend to take smaller values , and correlation between the patterns vanishes .",
    "the intensity of the antisymmetric part is typically @xmath92 of the symmetric part at its maximum .",
    "figure  [ fig:11 ] displays the symmetric part @xmath86 and the antisymmetric part @xmath88 of the correlation matrix obtained for the ncgl equation for several values of the time difference @xmath62 using color codes , as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "when there is no time difference ( @xmath90 ) , only the symmetric part takes finite values , and its diagonal components take largest values as in the case of the lcgl equation .",
    "however , the region where the correlation between adjacent scales takes its peak value is located at much smaller scale .",
    "when the time difference @xmath62 becomes a little larger , the difference becomes more remarkable ; there appear wide coherent regions with positive and negative correlation , which spread over scales shorter than the characteristic length of the system ( @xmath91 ) determined by the coupling range @xmath21 .",
    "this asymmetry is maintained up to a considerably large value of @xmath62 , which indicates that long - wavelength components at the reference time maintain strong correlations widely to shorter - wavelength components at later times .",
    "as we increase the time difference @xmath62 further , the correlation between scales gradually vanishes from the long - wavelength region .",
    "but it takes much longer than the case of the lcgl equation .",
    "these facts suggest the existence of cascade - like propagation of some quantity from long wavelength to shorter wavelength .",
    "the maximum intensity of the antisymmetric part is about @xmath93 of the symmetric part .",

    "[ fig:12 ] and [ fig:13 ] for scales smaller than the characteristic length . in the case of the lcgl equation",
    ", there is no clear ordering of the temporal variation of correlation .",
    "each curve has its maximum at some small value of @xmath62 , and vanishes quickly . in the case of the ncgl equation ,",
    "on the other hand , there exists a clear time ordering of the curves in scale ; the correlation between long - wavelength fluctuation ( small @xmath43 values ) becomes large earlier and decreases quickly , while the correlation between short - wavelength fluctuation ( large @xmath43 values ) becomes large later and decreases very slowly .",
    "( note the difference of time scale between the graphs for the lcgl and ncgl equations . )",
    "= 0.4    = 0.4",
    "as we demonstrated , our simple method based on the correlation matrix seems to visualize the spatio - temporal correlation between scales of spatio - temporal chaos successfully .",
    "our method clearly visualized the difference of dynamical process between two systems with different natures .",
    "especially , for the non - locally coupled system , it verified the existence of cascade - like propagation of correlation from long - wavelength components to shorter - wavelength components .",
    "first , the use of the wavelet transform is essential for our results .",
    "it seems difficult to obtain similar results using a method that flattens out the spatial information completely , like the fourier transform .",
    "as can clearly be seen from the definition of the inner product given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : innerproduct ] ) , our method captures the simultaneous fluctuation of two fields at the same position in space .",
    "for example , if we use a different definition of the inner product that loses the spatial information by taking spatial average of each field first , we can not observe the correlation between scales so clearly as in figs .",
    "[ fig:10 ] and [ fig:11 ] .",
    "similarly , if we change the definition of the inner product so as to multiply the fields with their origins shifted by half the system size , the correlation matrix almost vanishes .",
    "( this tendency is more remarkable for the ncgl equation . in the case of the lcgl equation , though not so clear , we obtain similar asymmetric correlation matrices with these modified definitions of the inner product .",
    "this is because with the values of @xmath8 and @xmath96 we used in our calculation , the ratio of the diffusion constant to the system size is considerably large , and some coherence over the whole system still remains .",
    "if we further decrease the value of @xmath8 , the correlation matrix tends to vanish as in the case of the ncgl equation . )",
    "conversely , the fact that we succeeded in visualization using the definition of the inner product given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : innerproduct ] ) implies that the cascade process occurs in spatially localized regions in our system .",
    "however , it is frequently seen in other systems that the spatial structure of the pattern collapses while moving constantly , as in the case of convective instability . in order to detect such phenomena",
    ", it would be possible to generalize the definition of the inner product in such a way that the distance between the origins of the fields is increased with @xmath62 .",
    "precisely speaking , the result visualized by our method is not a flow of causality , but merely a flow of correlation .",
    "namely , it indicates that fluctuation at the reference time at some scale varies in unison with fluctuation at the later time at some other scale , but it does not necessarily mean that the former one actually affects the latter one . of course , it is natural to interpret it as causality in our cases . but in order to be exact , it will be possible to perturb a certain mode at some scale , e.g. by using a sinusoidal wave , and visualize the propagation of its aftereffect to prove that it is indeed a causal relationship .    finally , though we did not give a detailed discussion in this paper , we will be able to investigate the dynamical process of the spatio - temporal chaos of non - locally coupled oscillators in more detail by quantitatively analyzing the results obtained by our method .",
    "for example , from the peak positions of the @xmath94 curves shown in fig.[fig:13 ] , we will be able to study the dependence of characteristic time scale of the underlying cascade process on the coupling strength .",
