    "v.v.kozlov + department of mechanics and mathematics + moscow state university + vorobievy gory , 119899 moscow , russia +      we consider the probability distribution in the phase space of hamiltonian system with the density @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a hamiltonian , @xmath2 is an absolute temperature , @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is a normalized factor .",
    "it plays the key role in the equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "gibbs show in  [ 1 ] that the averaging with respect to probability measure with density  ( 1 ) give rise to the fundamental relations of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "to deduce the canonical gibbs distribution one usually consider the ensemble of hamiltonian systems with hamiltonian function of the following form @xmath5 where @xmath6 thus at @xmath7 the system with hamiltonian  ( 2 ) is decomposed on  @xmath8 identical systems with  @xmath9 degrees of freedom and hamiltonian  @xmath10 .",
    "the canonical variables  @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 are the momenta  @xmath13 and coordinates  @xmath14 of separate subsystems .",
    "the perturbing function  @xmath15 is the energy of interaction of @xmath8  subsystems ; it usually depends on their coordinates  @xmath12 .",
    "small parameter  @xmath16 is the characteristic of intensity of subsystems interaction .",
    "we consider the case , when the hamiltonian  @xmath17 is sufficiently smooth with respect to variables  @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 .",
    "however , in application we often see cases with singular interaction .",
    "the classical example is the boltzmann - gibbs gas , the assembly of rigid balls in cube that elastically collide with each other ( see [ 1,2,3 ] ) .",
    "the traditional approach to the deduction of gibbs distribution suggested by fowler and darwin ( [ 4 ] , the rigorous exposition see in  [ 5,6 ] ) essentially uses the ergodic hypothesis : for all small  @xmath18 the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian  ( 2 ) is ergodic on fixed energy manifolds  @xmath19 . with some additional conditions some systems with hamiltonian  @xmath10 are distributed in accordance with formula  ( 1 ) as  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 .",
    "but the proof of ergodic hypothesis for specific hamiltonian systems is usually pretty difficult problem .",
    "moreover the ergodic hypothesis often contradicts with results of kam theory . in particular if the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian  @xmath10 is completely integrable and the energy surfaces  @xmath22 are compact , then the ergodic property is not present with certainty .    in view of this remark",
    "we can set the following interesting problem : prove that in analytical ( or even in infinitely differentiable ) case if the energy surfaces  @xmath22 are compact , then the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian  ( 2 ) never satisfy ergodic hypothesis .",
    "we can try to modify the fowler ",
    "darwin method assuming that @xmath23 and  @xmath8 depend on  @xmath16 in such way that  @xmath24 as  @xmath20 .",
    "we can assume that for some functions  @xmath25 the system with hamiltonian  ( 2 ) is ergodic on the surfaces  @xmath19 as a result of huge number of its degrees of freedom .",
    "this somewhat weakened version of ergodic hypothesis is closely related to the unsolved problem of estimation of small parameter in kam theory , when the `` last '' kolmogorov torus disappears . the weaker conjecture on transitivity of system with hamiltonian  ( 2 ) on energy surfaces  @xmath19 for large values of  @xmath8 and small  @xmath16 is not proved yet .",
    "if this problem has the positive answer , then we can assert the presence of diffusion in hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom ( see [ 79 ] ) .",
    "a different approach to the deduction of canonical gibbs distribution was proposed in the paper [ 10 ] .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that the stationary density of probability distribution is the integral of hamiltonian differential equations uniquely defined in the whole phase space . in this case",
    "the number of interacting subsystem  @xmath26 is fixed .",
    "more exactly in [ 10 ] we consider the case , when the subsystems have one degree of freedom :  @xmath27 . under some natural condition",
    "we can proceed to the angle ",
    "action variables in each subsystem , and using the well - known poincar method we can obtain the constructive condition of nonexistence of new integrals ( see [ 11,12 ] ) .",
    "the results of paper  [ 10 ] can be easily converted to the more general case , when  @xmath10 is a hamiltonian of completely integrable system .",
    "we are going to find out the sufficient conditions ( constructive if possible ) of nonintegrability of systems  ( 2)(3 ) .",
    "we study the conditions of existence of an integral @xmath28 of the canonical differential equations @xmath29 with a hamiltonian @xmath17 of the form  ( 2)(3 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the integral  @xmath30 depends on the parameter  @xmath16 .",
    "poincar considered the analytical case ; in particular we can construct the integral  @xmath30 as a power series with respect to  @xmath16 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath30 is a function of class  @xmath31 with respect to all the variables  @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 and  @xmath16 .",
    "hence we can suppose @xmath32 where @xmath33 and  @xmath34 are functions of class  @xmath31 and  @xmath35 with respect to  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 correspondingly .",
    "probably we can weaken the requirements to the class of smoothness of integral  @xmath30 , and the following arguments still will be correct .",
    "but this is a separate problem and we are not going to discuss it here .",
    "suppose @xmath7 .",
    "then we have a system of  @xmath8 independent subsystems .",
    "it is strongly nonergodic : at  @xmath7 system of differential equations  ( 4 ) has  @xmath8 independent first integrals @xmath36 it is clear that the function @xmath33 from expansion  ( 5 ) is a first integral of this unjointed system .",
    "let s show that under the specific conditions the function  @xmath33 depends only on  @xmath37",
    ". in particular these conditions will imply that any separate subsystem with  @xmath9 degrees of freedom does not nave first integrals independent on the integral of energy .",
    "the ideas of our arguments follows poincar method  [ 11 ] .",
    "let @xmath38 be a phase space of hamiltonian system with hamiltonian function  ( 6 ) . certainly for all  @xmath39 these spaces are identical .",
    "a phase space of new system is the direct product @xmath40 let @xmath41 be a value of total energy of system with number @xmath39 , and @xmath42 is the a energy surface . if the value of  @xmath41 is uncritical , then @xmath43 is a smooth @xmath44-dimensional manifold . at fixed values of  @xmath45 and  @xmath7 unjoined hamiltonian system",
    "( 4 ) is reduced to the direct product of dynamical systems defined on @xmath46      _ example .",
    "_ suppose the following dynamical system @xmath50 with constant incommensurable systems @xmath51 is defined on direct product of @xmath3-dimensional tori @xmath52 . according to the weyl theorem , each separate subsystem is ergodic on  @xmath53 . but equations  ( 7 ) have single - valued nonconstant integrals @xmath54 ( @xmath55 )",
    ".    * remark . * _ however , if hamiltonian systems are weakly mixing ( mixing ) systems on  @xmath48 , then their direct product also has weakly mixing ( mixing ) property on  @xmath49 .",
    "in particular in these cases the function  @xmath33 is constant on any connected component of manifold  @xmath49 .",
    "_    let @xmath56 be a nondegenerate periodic trajectory of system with number @xmath39 with energy  @xmath41 , @xmath57 its period , and  @xmath58 its frequency . according to floquet ",
    "lyapunov theorem , in a neighborhood of this trajectory on  @xmath48 we can express the coordinates  @xmath59,@xmath60 , so that in the new variables the motion equation obtain the following form : @xmath61 here @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and  constant square matrix  @xmath64 of order  @xmath65 is nondegenerate .",
    "assuming in  ( 8) @xmath66 we obtain the equation of periodic trajectory : @xmath67    according to the assumption on non degeneracy of periodic trajectory  @xmath56 , nondegenerate periodic trajectories with similar period are situated on close energy surfaces  @xmath48 ; periods and frequencies continuously depend on energy  @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that the direct product @xmath68 is @xmath69dimensional invariant torus of canonical system of differential equations  ( 4 ) at  @xmath7 situated on  @xmath49 . in the neighborhood of this torus the equation of motion",
    "have form ( 8) . hence ,",
    "such torus is reducible and nondegenerate ( see , for example , [ 12 ] ) . on the torus",
    "the equation are reduced to a conditionally - periodic form ( 9 ) .",
    "as usually , we call an invariant torus nonresonance if the frequencies @xmath70 are independent on the ring of integers . in the further analysis the following condition is essential      _ example .",
    "_ let separate subsystems describe the inertial motion on the manifold @xmath72 of negative curvature .",
    "energy @xmath73 is non - negative .",
    "all periodic trajectories with positive energy are hyperbolical ; hence they are not degenerate .",
    "periodic trajectories are the motions on closed geodetics on @xmath72 with different speed . if @xmath74 is a length of closed geodetic , then the period is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "hence the frequency @xmath76 is defined by the formula @xmath77 since the lengths of @xmath8 geodetics @xmath78 are fixed , then for almost all positive values of energy @xmath79 the frequencies @xmath70 are incommensurable .",
    "it is possible to show ( and this is a separate problem ) that in a considered situation condition a is fulfilled .",
    "_ since @xmath33 is an integral of system of equations ( 4 ) at @xmath7 , then ( according to the kronecker theorem ) @xmath33 is constant on any nonresonance torus @xmath80 . since this torus is reducible and nondegenerate , then @xmath81 in points @xmath82 ( see [ 12 ] , ch .",
    "iv ) . according to condition a , for almost all values of @xmath71 nonresonance tori are everywhere dense on @xmath49 .",
    "hence , @xmath81 on such manifolds @xmath49 .",
    "therefore @xmath33 is constant on their connected components . for other values of @xmath73",
    "the conclusion of proposition 1 follows by continuity",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* _ the proof shows that in condition a instead of `` for almost all admissible values of @xmath71 '' we can say `` for everywhere dense set of values of @xmath71 '' .",
    "however , such weakening of condition a practically does not give anything new . _    in further analysis we will use the proposition on everywhere density of the set of maximum resonance tori ( when all frequencies are rationally expressed through one frequency ) .",
    "this condition together with condition a produces `` an alternation '' of resonance and nonresonance invariant tori and replaces the condition of nondegeneracy of non - perturbed completely integrable system in the poincar theory .",
    "let us consider a case , when function the @xmath83 has a finite number of critical values @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "such situation is common in applications . when the total energy @xmath86 passes through the critical value , the continuous dependence of energy surface @xmath87 on @xmath86 is lost . in that moment",
    "its topology generally changes .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the plot of hamiltonian @xmath10 with three critical values .",
    "the points @xmath88 and @xmath89 are stationary values of @xmath90 , and the critical point @xmath91 is not a stationary value .",
    "the presence of the nonstationary critical points is the characteristic property of potentials describing gravitational or coulomb interaction .",
    "let s denote as @xmath92 an open parallelepiped in @xmath93 .",
    "this parallelepiped is a direct product of the intervals @xmath94 if number @xmath95 is larger than @xmath96 , then we replace @xmath97 with a symbol @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "2 these domains are shown for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "each point @xmath101,@xmath102 corresponds to a smooth regular manifold , which may consist of several connected parts .",
    "the quantity of connected components of @xmath49 does not depend on a point @xmath101 ; we denote this number by symbol @xmath103 .",
    "* proposition 2 . * _ for any connected component of domain @xmath105 there exists the continuously differentiable function _",
    "@xmath107 _ such that the following equality is fulfilled in this domain _",
    "_ it is clear that the domain @xmath105 is foliated to the regular surfaces @xmath110 .",
    "the function @xmath33 is constant on these surfaces ( more exactly on their connected components ) ( the proposition 1 ) .",
    "hence , on any connected component @xmath105 the function @xmath33 has natural representation ( 11 ) . by definition in any point @xmath105 functions @xmath37 are independent .",
    "therefore we can introduce locally new coordinates so that @xmath37 will appear as @xmath8 of new variables .",
    "the transition to such coordinates is carried out with certainty with the help of continuously differentiable reversible transformation . in new variables",
    "the function @xmath33 is continuously differentiable and depends only on @xmath8 variables @xmath111 .",
    "the proposition is proved .",
    "let us consider again an invariant torus @xmath82 of non - perturbed system .",
    "the equations of motion on the torus are reduced to form ( 9 ) .",
    "this torus we call completely resonance if there exist @xmath112 linearly independent integer vectors @xmath113 such that @xmath114 in other words all frequencies @xmath115 are rationally expressed through one of them .",
    "this is equivalent to the proposition that all solutions of differential equations ( 9 ) on the torus @xmath80 are periodic with the same period .",
    "let @xmath116 be a restriction of perturbing function @xmath117 on the invariant torus @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath116 is @xmath118periodic function of @xmath119 .",
    "we associate it with multiple fourier series @xmath120    a nonresonance torus we call the poincar torus if the factors of fourier decomposition ( 13 ) with numbers @xmath121 are nonzero . since the poincar tori consist of the separate closed trajectories",
    ", they have no `` rigidity '' property and collapse after the addition of perturbation .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the family of degenerate periodic trajectories , components of the poincar torus , at perturbation give rise to the finite number of nondegenerate periodic trajectories with close transition .",
    "let us introduce finally the poincar set @xmath122 .",
    "it is a set of points from @xmath93 , which are the images of the poincar tori under the `` energy '' mapping @xmath123 : a point with coordinates @xmath124 passes to a point with coordinates @xmath125    * remark . *",
    "_ in the poincar _",
    "_ theory [ 11,12 ] the",
    "usually supposition is that the non - perturbed system with the hamiltonian @xmath126 is completely integrable and nondegenerate .",
    "therefore the set of its first integrals is a set of action variables `` numerating '' the invariant tori .",
    "the poincar _ _ set ( introduced in [ 12 ] ) is defined here as a set of points in space of action variables corresponding to the completely resonance tori collapsing after the addition of perturbation . in our case functions @xmath37 are the set of integrals of the non - perturbed problem and the poincar _ _",
    "set is a set of points in space of values of these integrals . _",
    "_ let @xmath129 be a poisson bracket connected with symplectic structure on @xmath104 . since function @xmath30 is the first integral of initial system ( 4 ) , then @xmath130 for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath131 , then @xmath132 using decomposition ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) we receive from ( 14 ) the equality @xmath133 well known that @xmath134 is a derivative of @xmath34 by virtue of the initial system of differential equations with hamiltonian @xmath126 .",
    "the poisson bracket @xmath134 has similar sense .",
    "besides by formula ( 11 ) we obtain @xmath135    now let us restrict equality ( 15 ) on the invariant torus @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath136 is equal to the derivative of restriction of function @xmath34 on @xmath80 by virtue of system of differential equations ( 9 ) .",
    "let @xmath137 be a restriction of @xmath34 on @xmath80 and @xmath138 its fourier series .",
    "in points @xmath139 the left part of ( 5.4 ) becomes @xmath140        now let @xmath80 be the poincar torus .",
    "setting @xmath3 equal to @xmath121 we obtain that @xmath76 as a vector of @xmath69dimensional space is orthogonal to the hyperplane @xmath143 generated by linearly independent vectors @xmath121 . since @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , then we obtain from ( 20 ) @xmath112 linear relations : @xmath146 hence the vector with components @xmath147 is orthogonal to the hyperplane @xmath143 and consequently it is collinear to the vector @xmath148 .",
    "hence @xmath149 .      *",
    "* _ since functions @xmath116 and @xmath151 are assumed to be only once continuously differentiable , then the fourier series ( 13 ) , ( 17)-(19 ) may diverge . in this",
    "case relations ( 20 ) can be deduced in another way . for this purpose",
    "we multiply the derivative with respect to time _",
    "@xmath152 _ on @xmath153 , apply the operation of averaging over _ @xmath80 @xmath154 _ and integrate by parts . in result",
    "we obtain the left part of relation ( 20 ) up to the factor @xmath155 .",
    "the right part of ( 20 ) is obtained similarly . _              indeed , introducing the new variables @xmath159,@xmath160 instead of",
    "@xmath37 we can write down formula ( 11 ) in the another form : @xmath161 since functions @xmath33 and @xmath126 are dependent , then the right part of this equality actually does not depend on @xmath159 .",
    "now let @xmath16 tend to zero . at the limit",
    "we obtain the @xmath8 unjoined subsystems moving independently : the change of the initial data @xmath162 , @xmath163 for @xmath164 does not affect the dynamics of subsystem with number @xmath39 . in order to be consistent we shall also assume at @xmath7 that the subsystem with number @xmath39 being in some fixed state @xmath165 is a random event .",
    "the following natural condition plays the main role in the process of deduction of gibbs distribution      if @xmath166,@xmath167 is a density of probability distribution of the subsystem with number  @xmath39 , and @xmath168 is a density of probability distribution in the initial system with hamiltonian ( 2 ) , then using condition c and the rules of multiplication of probabilities of independent events we obtain as @xmath20 the following equality : @xmath169    equality ( 22 ) is also called the gibbs hypothesis on the preservation of thermodynamic equilibrium of subsystems at vanishing interaction ( [ 1 ] , see also [ 13 ] ) .",
    "the sense of this term will be explained below .",
    "_ proof of theorem . _",
    "first note that @xmath174 is a function of hamiltonian @xmath47 only , and it is continuously differentiable in all open intervals @xmath175 more exactly the number of such functions is equal to the number of the connected components of level surface @xmath48 , when the energy @xmath41 changes in each of intervals ( 24 ) .",
    "some of these functions may coincide .    indeed , for almost all @xmath176 the hamiltonian system with hamiltonian @xmath47 has everywhere dense set of nondegenerate periodic trajectories on energy surfaces @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise condition a is not fulfilled because of the identity of separate subsystems .",
    "then , according to poincar [ 11 ] , the points of nondegenerate periodic trajectories are stationary for the restriction of any first integral on @xmath48 .",
    "the continuity imply that the first integrals of hamiltonian system with hamiltonian function @xmath47 are constant on the connected components of @xmath48 .",
    "at last we should note that @xmath174 is the first integral and use the ( simplified ) arguments of section 4 .",
    "now let us consider again equation ( 22 ) true on any parallelepiped @xmath156 : @xmath177 this functional equation is easily solved .",
    "we differentiate ( 25 ) sequentially with respect to @xmath37 and divide the result on the product @xmath178 . in result",
    "we obtain the following chain of equations @xmath179 here @xmath180 is some constant independent on the number @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath181 the dimension of constant @xmath180 is equal to the inverse energy dimension . usually one suppose that @xmath182 , where @xmath2 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we should note that formula ( 26 ) may depend on the choice of multiindex @xmath102 .",
    "more precisely , any connected component of the set @xmath183 has its own set of the factors @xmath180 and @xmath172 in ( 26 ) .",
    "however , we can easily show that the constant @xmath180 has an universal character . indeed , suppose the constants @xmath180 in formula ( 26 ) are equal to the values @xmath184 on some connected component of domain @xmath105 with some index @xmath185 .",
    "then , according to ( 6.1 ) , in this domain @xmath186 if some @xmath187 are not equal to each other , then functions ( 27 ) and @xmath188 are independent .",
    "but this statement contradicts to the corollary of proposition 3 .",
    "the last remaining possibility is that constants @xmath172 in formula ( 26 ) are different on the different intervals of values of energy ( 24 ) .",
    "but in reality this possibility is not realized because of the continuity property of functions @xmath189 .      in conclusion of the work we shall make one important remark . the gibbs theory presented in [ 1 ]",
    "does not imply that the densities of probability distributions @xmath190 should be continuous functions on @xmath38 .",
    "we can consider more general situation and assume , for example , that functions @xmath174 are continuously differentiable only on those domains of phase space @xmath38 , in which energy is contained between its neighboring critical values @xmath191 naturalness of such assumption is already evident if we consider the example of mathematical pendulum : the separatrices on phase cylinder separate the domains with essentially different type of motion ( fluctuations and rotations ) .    applying the developed above method",
    "we again obtain formula ( 23 ) , but the constants @xmath192 have different values in different domains ( 28 ) .",
    "moreover , these constants may be different for different connected components of domains ( 28 ) .",
    "it is quite possible that such generalized discontinuous gibbs distribution could be useful for the study of concrete thermodynamic systems .",
    "let us assume , for example , that the phase space @xmath38 has only two domains @xmath193 and @xmath194 of form ( 28 ) . in domains @xmath195",
    "we have the following densities of distributions @xmath196 we calculate the constants @xmath197 and @xmath198 using the normalizing condition @xmath199 if the difference @xmath200 is given , then factors @xmath201 are uniquely defined by this equality : @xmath202 since @xmath203 , then the right parts of these equalities are positive",
