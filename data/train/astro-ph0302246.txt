    "stars at the top of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) are of interest , primarily for two reasons .",
    "first , they are undergoing mass loss  via mechanisms which are still poorly understood .",
    "secondly , they represent the most luminous phase in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars and , as high resolution techniques enable us to examine stars in ever more distant galaxies , are therefore among the first individual objects to be isolated in a given population ; furthermore , they will contribute a significant fraction of the infrared luminosity of distant unresolved populations ( ferraro et al .",
    "1995 ; mouhcine & lanon 2002 ) . the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provides a particularly useful laboratory for the studies of luminous agb stars at a known distance but with a range of initial masses .",
    "two factors complicate the studies of these luminous agb stars - their long period large amplitude variability , which necessitates observations over periods of many years , and their high mass - loss rates which lead to thick dust shells and necessitate observations at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "earlier papers in this series ( loup et al .",
    "( 1997 - paper  i ) , zijlstra et al .",
    "( 1996 - paper  ii ) , van loon et al . ( 1997 , 1998 , papers  iii and iv ) , trams et al . ( 1999b - paper  v ) and van loon et al .  (",
    "1999 - paper  vi ) ) described the identification of luminous agb stars in the lmc , using iras and @xmath8 photometry , as well as extensive iso observations of a subset of them , and the derivation of their mass - loss rates .",
    "this paper concentrates on the variability characteristics of the sample , reporting near - infrared ( @xmath8 ) photometry obtained in support of the spectroscopy and mid - infrared photometry discussed in previous papers ( i to vi ) .",
    "these data , together with others from the literature , are used to determine pulsation periods and amplitudes and to look for long - term trends in the behaviour of the stars .",
    "they are also combined with the observations discussed previously to determine the bolometric magnitudes and examine their relationship with the pulsation characteristics of the stars .",
    "it is known that stars near to the end of their agb evolution are large amplitude , reasonably regular pulsators and that stars with these characteristics form a well defined group ( e.g. whitelock 2002 and references therein ) . as the intention here",
    "is to consider stars very near to the tip of the agb , we use the information at our disposal to isolate the objects of interest , removing from the sample supergiants as well as semi - regular and irregular pulsators .",
    "following feast , whitelock & menzies ( 2002 ) we assume here that the distance modulus of the lmc is @xmath9 mag , and , where necessary , the results of other analyses are corrected to this value .      towards the end of agb evolution , in stars with initial masses in excess of 4 or 5 @xmath10 ( or perhaps at even lower masses for very low metallicities ) , the base of the h - rich convective - envelope can dip into the h - burning shell ;",
    "the introduction of fresh h - rich material into the nuclear - burning shell allows the luminosity to go above the core - mass luminosity predictions ( blcker & schnberner 1991 ) .",
    "this process is known as envelope burning or hot bottom burning .",
    "carbon is burned to nitrogen affecting the transition from oxygen - rich to carbon - rich , although the details depend on the model and particularly on how mass loss is treated .",
    "hbb may prevent c stars from forming at all until the envelope mass is depleted ( frost et al .",
    "1998 ) , although in some models c stars do form and hbb turns the stars back from c - rich to o - rich . another consequence , for stars in a rather narrow mass range , is the formation of lithium and its mixing to the surface via the beryllium transport mechanism ( sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1995 ) surveyed luminous agb stars in the lmc and smc for lithium - the clearest indication that hbb is taking place .",
    "two stars in our sample are known to be undergoing hbb from the presence of lithium in their spectra ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ) , viz , the o - rich star hv12070 and c - rich star shv052106904 ( shvf4488 ) .",
    "trams et al .",
    "( 1999a ) showed that the luminous c star , iras044966958 , has a silicate shell and suggested that it has only very recently stopped hbb .",
    "these three stars are of particular interest and are identified in the various diagrams and the discussion which follows .",
    "there are very few lmc stars whose spectra have been examined for lithium , so none of the others are actually known for certain _ not _ to be experiencing hbb .",
    "indeed we would guess that several other stars considered in this paper are in the same condition .    a preliminary analysis of the results from this paper , with an emphasis on the significance of the hbb stars in the period - luminosity relation ,",
    "was discussed by whitelock & feast ( 2000 ) .",
    "the coordinates and alternative names of the sources discussed here were listed in paper  i , while paper  ii gives the results of the first batch of @xmath8 photometry .",
    "in addition to the sources discussed in previous papers in this series we include a few agb variables previously observed from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) for which new observations have been obtained .",
    "these stars have only thin dust shells , but provide a useful link with the work of feast et al .",
    "( 1989 ) who established a period - luminosity ( pl ) relation from @xmath11 observations of these stars and others like them .",
    "near - infrared ( @xmath8 ) photometry was carried out between 1993 and 2001 using the mk  iii photometer on the saao 1.9-m telescope at sutherland and transformed onto the saao standard system defined by carter ( 1990 ) .",
    "earlier observations were obtained for some sources as part of other programmes and some of the data published by feast et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , catchpole & feast ( 1981 ) or glass et al .",
    "the new results are listed in table  [ table.jhkl ] which also gives the julian date ( jd ) of the observation .",
    "measurements were made through either 12 or 18 arcsec apertures depending on the seeing and the crowding of the individual source .",
    "a few of the older observations were made on the 0.75-m telescope through a 36 arcsec aperture ",
    "they are marked with an asterisk in the @xmath7 column .",
    "the magnitudes are accurate to better than @xmath12 mag , unless they are quoted to one decimal place when they are good to @xmath13 mag .",
    "many of the sources were too faint to measure at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath7 , particularly near minimum light .",
    "it also remains possible that some of the fainter magnitudes quoted at @xmath14 have been slightly contaminated due to the close proximity of other sources .",
    "the @xmath8 observation quoted in paper  ii for iras044986842 is actually a measure for iras050036712 .",
    "the observation for iras052896617 was of the wrong source ; only one observation was obtained for the correct object .",
    "the star rhv0524173660913 was not part of the iso programme and was observed towards the end of our programme because it appeared to be a particularly luminous c - star .",
    "the c spectral type comes from reid , hughes & glass ( 1995 ) and its position in a pl relation is shown in fig .  1 of groenewegen & whitelock ( 1996 ) where it lies well above the standard relation .",
    "however , we identify it here with the star that westerlund , olander & hedin ( 1981 ) classified as an m giant and which is known as wohg311 ( or wohg310 ) .",
    "it is considered to be an o - rich star in the following discussion , but another spectrum is required to settle the matter . if it really is an m star that has turned into a c star it is obviously extremely interesting and perhaps similar to iras044966958 ( trams et al .",

    "<S> the characteristics of oxygen - rich and carbon - rich , large amplitude ( @xmath0 mag ) , asymptotic giant branch variables in the large magellanic clouds are discussed , with an emphasis on those obscured by dust . near - infrared photometry , obtained over about 8 years , </S>",
    "<S> is combined with published mid - infrared observations from iras and iso to determine bolometric magnitudes for 42 stars . </S>",
    "<S> pulsation periods of the o - rich stars are in the range @xmath1 days , while those for c - rich stars have @xmath2 days . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the regular pulsations , one o - rich star and four c - rich stars show large amplitude , @xmath3 mag , secular or very long period variations which may be associated with changes in their mass - loss rates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss and compare various methods of determining the bolometric magnitudes and show , perhaps surprisingly , that most of the very long period stars seem to follow an extrapolation of the period - luminosity relation determined for stars with shorter periods - although the details do depend on how the bolometric magnitudes are calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> three stars with thin shells , which are clearly more luminous than the obscured agb stars , are undergoing hot bottom burning , while other stars with similar luminosities have yet to be investigated in sufficient detail to determine their status in this regard . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that an apparent change in slope of the period luminosity relation around 400 - 420 days is caused by variables with luminosities brighter than the predictions of the core - mass luminosity relation , due to excess flux from hot bottom burning .    </S>",
