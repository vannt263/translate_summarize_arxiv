    "l1551 irs  5 is one of the best objects for the study of outflows and jets emanating from low - mass young stars .",
    "this is due largely to its proximity ( @xmath10 140 pc ) , visibility , and isolation .",
    "it was the first object in which a molecular molecular outflow , with a co radial velocity of @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 , was discovered @xcite .",
    "the co outflow emission shows an apparent linear acceleration @xcite , which suggests that the outflow should consist of ambient material swept up by an invisible fast jet or wind . a high - velocity ( @xmath12100  km  s@xmath6 ) atomic wind was later detected inside the co lobe @xcite .",
    "the existence of a fast wind can be deduced from the many optical and h@xmath13 emission - line features showing large proper motions and radial velocities inside the blue - shifted lobe @xcite .",
    "l1551 irs  5 is also the first object toward which an optical jet was detected @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution radio observations revealed that l1551 irs  5 is a binary , or even triple , system of embedded young stellar objects , referred to as the l1551 irs  5 vla sources , with two jets emanating from them @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ feiiim2002 ] an image of the jets taken with an [ ]  narrow - band filter on 2002 november 27 for reference .",
    "it shows the two jets emanating from l1551 irs  5 in the [ ]  @xmath0 1.644 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "the jets can be distinguished from each other at a position more than 3@xmath14 away from the driving sources in the figure . along the northern jet ,",
    "three strong knots ( phk1 , phk2 , and phk3 ) have been labeled @xcite .",
    "several knots in the northern jet show proper motions along the flow , indicating episodic mass ejection from irs  5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected evidence of episodic mass loss in the molecular outflow along the axis of the blueshifted lobe .",
    "the molecular outflow has a longer dynamical time scale ( a few @xmath3 10@xmath15 yr ) than the optical jets ( 10@xmath1610@xmath17 yr ) .",
    "the episodic mass - loss events could be related to the fact that irs  5 is an fu  ori type star @xcite .",
    "we have been studying the kinematics and structure of jets at their bases by analyzing the near - infrared [ ]  ( @xmath01.644  @xmath1 m ) emission line which , due to its small extinction , traces jets closer to their driving sources than optical forbidden lines would .",
    "this is the third of a series of papers on high spectral and spatial resolution [ ]  spectroscopy of l1551 irs  5 with _",
    "subaru _ , an 8-meter - diameter ground - based optical and infrared telescope . in previous papers @xcite",
    ", we explained that the northern jet has two distinct velocity components : the low - velocity component ( lvc ) with a velocity of @xmath18100  km  s@xmath6  and the high - velocity component ( hvc ) with a velocity of @xmath18300  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the lvc is much stronger than the hvc at phk1 , the brightest [ ]  knot located close ( 12 in 2002 december ) to the l1551 irs  5 vla sources ( hereafter called as irs  5 vla , a singular proper noun ) .",
    "it shows a wide spatial width and a broad line width of 130160  km  s@xmath6  near irs  5 vla , implying a large opening angle of 50100@xmath19 .",
    "these characteristics are similar to the molecular extremely high velocity ( ehv ) outflows @xcite .",
    "the hvc , on the other hand , consistently shows a narrow line width ( @xmath540  km  s@xmath6 ) , is extended farther away from irs  5 vla , and is dominated in intensity at phk2 , a bright [ ]  knot that was located @xmath547 away from irs  5 vla .",
    "however , the previous observations did not fully cover the [ ]  emission region , and the morphology and kinematics of the hvc and lvc , and their interrelation have remained unclear  especially at phk1 , where the northern and southern jets merge together spatially and the lvc is no longer separated from the southern jet because the two have a similar velocity .",
    "the presence of two velocity components in jet emissions is an important clue to understanding the launching mechanism of outflows from young stellar objects .",
    "magnetocentrifugal acceleration has been widely accepted as a promising explanation for the launching mechanism of outflows from a young star - disk system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two popular models based on this magnetocentrifugal mechanism : the `` @xmath20-wind model '' @xcite and the `` disk - wind model '' @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-wind model postulates that an outflow originates from a very narrow radial range of an accretion disk near its inner edge , where the highly concentrated stellar magnetic field interacts with the disk .",
    "the disk - wind model assumes that an outflow is launched from the wider radial range of an accretion disk .",
    "the terminal velocity of a magnetocentrifugally accelerated outflow scales with the keplerian rotation velocity at its launching radius @xcite .",
    "thus , the velocity width of a disk - wind should naturally be wider than that of an @xmath20-wind .",
    "this difference between the two models is best recognized in synthesized position - velocity diagrams ( pvds ) @xcite .",
    "high spatial- and velocity - resolution spectroscopy is essential for the direct comparison of observations with these model calculations .    here",
    "we present the results of [ ]  line slit - scan observations covering the base of the l1551 irs  5 jets with 13 fully sampled transverse slit locations .",
    "we constructed a three - dimensional data cube to analyze the spatial - velocity structure of the [ ]  jets .",
    "observations of the l1551 irs  5 jets were conducted on 2004 december 1 ( ut ) using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope atop mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "h_-band spectra were taken using the ircs echelle spectrograph , which is equipped with a raytheon 1024@xmath31024 insb array with an aladdin ii multiplexer .",
    "the near - infrared slit viewer of ircs allowed us to place the slit accurately at selected positions on the jets .",
    "this was essential to match spectra with spatial coordinates .",
    "we used a slit of 06@xmath359 ( width@xmath3length ) .",
    "the slit width provided a velocity resolution of 60 km  s@xmath6  ( @xmath215,000 ) . the pixel scale along the slit length was 0060 pixel@xmath6 . the spectra were taken around phk1 at 13 slit positions , at a position angle ( pa ) of 346@xmath22 , which was perpendicular to the northern jet .",
    "adjacent slit positions were separated by 0@xmath233 , i.e. half of the slit width .",
    "the field of view covered by the 13 slits was 5@xmath239 @xmath3 4@xmath232 .",
    "we made three sets of slit scans . because of the variable sky conditions , only one set showed good data quality .",
    "that set was used for this paper .",
    "the total on - source exposure time was 180  s for each slit position .",
    "the seeing ( fwhm ) was @xmath504 at the _ h_-band .",
    "the area covered by the current slit scan observations is shown in figure  [ feiiim2002 ] ( lower panel ) by a thick rectangle , together with the coordinate system ( @xmath20 , @xmath24 ) that we use in this paper .",
    "these are all superimposed on the contour versions of the upper panel image .",
    "the positions of irs  5 vla , phk1 , phk2 and phk3 are also marked .",
    "sky spectra were obtained before and after each set of slit scans . the atmospheric oh airglow emission",
    "was satisfactorily removed from the object spectra when the properly scaled sky spectra above the background level were subtracted from them . in order to find a proper scaling factor for each object",
    "s spectrum when removing oh features , we used a strong oh line at @xmath01.6502  @xmath1 m to derive a scaling factor so that the standard deviation of the residual ( object @xmath8 scaled sky ) at the line was minimized , while keeping the average of the residual at zero .",
    "we observed the standard star hd  35656 ( a0v , t@xmath259480  k , @xmath266.403  mag ) to use its spectrum for removing telluric lines and to calibrate flux .",
    "the data were reduced mainly using the echelle and longslit packages in iraf @xcite . after making a three - dimensional data cube with iraf",
    ", we used idl to analyze it .",
    "figure  [ feii]@xmath27 shows the continuum - subtracted [ ]  line image integrated over the entire emission velocity of @xmath8420 to @xmath2820 km  s@xmath6  with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "note that this is a pure [ ]  line image in which the continuum emission is subtracted accurately down to the noise level .",
    "slit - scan imaging allowed such accurate continuum subtraction because the continuum and [ ]  line were observed at exactly the same time .",
    "it is difficult , on the other hand , to construct a pure line image from two narrow - band filter images `` on '' and `` off '' a given line emission if they are not taken simultaneously .",
    "this is because the continuous variation of sky conditions makes it difficult to match the continuum levels between the two images .    in figure  [ feii]@xmath27 , the [ ]  emission peak",
    "is called phk1 ( paper  i ) and is plotted at @xmath290@xmath14 and @xmath30 0@xmath14 , where @xmath20 is along the slit length ( pa  @xmath31  346 ) and @xmath24 is perpendicular to it ( pa  @xmath31  256 ) . a new knot is seen in figure  [ feii]@xmath27 at @xmath30 06 near the tip of the elongation .",

    "the emission peak moves from larger to smaller positions of @xmath24 , with the velocity in each panel reflecting the velocity gradient in the hvc . although the channel maps in panels [ channelmaps]@xmath44 and [ channelmaps]@xmath45 ( @xmath8267.1 km  s@xmath6@xmath42208.1 km  s@xmath6 ) show an elongated geometry similar to that of the hvc , both the hvc and lvc of the northern jet contribute to the emission in these channels ( see figure  [ ipvd ] ) . the emission in panel [ channelmaps]@xmath46 ( @xmath8208.1 km  s@xmath6@xmath42178.5 km  s@xmath6 ) comes from the lvc without contamination from the southern jet . the spatial width at this velocity is 066 , which is similar to that of the hvc",
    "in the panels [ channelmaps]@xmath47[channelmaps]@xmath48 ( @xmath8178.5 km  s@xmath6@xmath4260.5 km  s@xmath6 ) , the southern jet overlaps with the lvc and the spatial width becomes as large as 1@xmath2 .",
    "channel maps [ channelmaps]@xmath49 and [ channelmaps]@xmath50 ( @xmath860.5 km  s@xmath6@xmath421.5 km  s@xmath6 ) are free from the southern jet emission and show the less - blueshifted , lower - velocity emission from the northern jet .",

    "this is one of the most remarkable diagrams created from the slit scan observational data .",
    "first , the southern jet can be traced down to @xmath24=@xmath8060 , i.e. as close as 06 from the driving source irs  5 vla .",
    "this is because the radial velocity of the southern jet is almost constant at @xmath9 @xmath8120@xmath410 km  s@xmath6 with a relatively narrow fwhm width of 80.5@xmath415.3 km  s@xmath6  ( fwhm )",
    "if deconvolved with the velocity resolution of 60 km  s@xmath6 ] , in contrast to the large velocity width of the lvc ( 150180  km  s@xmath6  fwhm ) .",
    "even at @xmath5606 where the lvc mingles with the southern jet , the southern jet can be separated from the lvc .",
    "note that the southern jet can be traced only at @xmath571@xmath14 ( @xmath582@xmath14 from the driving source ) in the velocity - integrated spatial map in figure  [ feii]@xmath27 ( or figure  [ ipvd]@xmath27 ) .",
    "figure  [ vx_pvds ] shows that the southern jet gradually drifts away from @xmath5901 to @xmath808 as @xmath24 increases from @xmath8060 to 162 . the flux density of the southern jet reaches its maximum at @xmath24=0@xmath2 , i.e. at phk1 , where it is 2.5 times larger than that at @xmath24=162 .",
    "this means that the southern jet significantly contributes to the [ ]  flux of phk1 .",
    "second , the lower ( less - blueshifted side ) velocity cutoff of the lvc tends to decrease with @xmath24 .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ vx_pvds ] as the lowest contours intersect the @xmath20=  0 line at @xmath9 0 km  s@xmath6  for @xmath600@xmath2 ; this occurs at @xmath1850 km  s@xmath6  for @xmath6112 .",
    "the higher ( more - blueshifted side ) velocity cutoff of the lvc is rather constant in this range of @xmath24 .",
    "an interesting point is that the decrease in the lower velocity cutoff of the lvc is similar to that seen in the hvc : its peak velocity decreases from @xmath62263 to @xmath8312 km  s@xmath6  with increasing @xmath24 from 0@xmath2 to 1@xmath2 .",
    "however , we conclude that the two similar tendencies are unrelated because the velocity gradient of hvc seen for 0@xmath631@xmath2 is time variable ( see  [ sec : comparison ] ) , while the lower cutoff velocity gradient of lvc does not vary with time , as seen in the pvd taken four years ago .      in this section",
    "we summarize some of the important points for the discussion below by comparing the current [ ]  data with previous spectroscopic data taken in 2000 december ( paper  i ) and 2002 november ( paper  ii ) .    1 .",
    "the pure [ ]  line image ( figure  [ feii]@xmath27 ) bears a close resemblance to figure  2@xmath27 ( paper  i ) that was constructed from two narrow - band filter images `` on '' and `` off '' of the [ ]  line .",
    "this means that the continuum was satisfactorily subtracted in the previous work . because of the slightly improved seeing , or possible time variation between 2000 and 2004 , figure  [ feii]@xmath27 shows the elongation of phk1 along the northern jet more clearly than figure  2@xmath27 in paper  i. 2 .",
    "the offset between the _ h_-band continuum peak and phk1 remains the same as before .",
    "it was 056 in 2000 december ( paper i ) .",
    "the actual pixel scale was 80% of this value and the true separation was 056 ( see * ? ? ? * ) . ] and 060 in 2004 december ( present work ) .",
    "the difference in the offsets is within the measurement error of @xmath501 and is much smaller than that expected from the proper motions of 0@xmath2320@xmath2344 yr@xmath6 for the other knots @xcite .",
    "because the continuum peak position seems stationary , or at least its proper motion is much smaller than those of the other knots , phk1 may also be stationary with respect to the irs  5 vla .",
    "previous measurements ( noted in paper  i ) revealed that , within an uncertainty of 025 , the _",
    "h_-band continuum peak coincides with the _",
    "k_-band peak position , which is located at 057 @xmath4 035 ( @xmath64055 , @xmath38013 ) away from irs  5 vla @xcite .",
    "this places irs  5 vla at @xmath6512 @xmath4 04 .",
    "the @xmath24-velocity diagram ( yvd ) in figure  [ ipvd]@xmath35 is compared with fig .",
    "2@xmath35 in paper  i , which is a yvd taken in 2000 december , but is not integrated over @xmath20 at each position of @xmath24 . although both yvds show the two velocity components , there is a notable difference in the radial velocities of the hvc .",
    "the radial velocity of hvc does not vary largely with @xmath24 for 0@xmath631@xmath2 in the 2000 december data ( figure  2@xmath35 in paper  i ) , while it decreases from @xmath8263 to @xmath8312 km  s@xmath6  with @xmath24 for 0@xmath631@xmath2 in the 2004 december data ( figure  [ ipvd]@xmath35 ) .",
    "this difference is a result of time variation because the radial velocity gradient of hvc seen in paper  i is not reproducible from any cross - section of the current data cube ( see figure  [ channelmaps ] ) .",
    "figure  [ ipvd]@xmath53 ( xvd ) is compared with fig .",
    "1@xmath27 of paper  ii , which is an xvd taken in 2002 november but is not integrated over @xmath24 .",
    "the two diagrams share common features , except that the southern jet at @xmath66 120 km  s@xmath6  for @xmath670@xmath2 is more conspicuous in figure  [ ipvd]@xmath53 because it is integrated over @xmath24 where the southern jet gives significant contribution .",
    "the lowest contours in these figures show a very large spatial width corresponding to the spatially wide subcomponent of lvc ( lvc@xmath68 ) reported in paper  ii .",
    "figure  [ vx_pvds ] suggests that the broad , `` flat topped '' [ ]  line profiles in lvc that were reported in paper  i at @xmath6904 to @xmath808 are most likely formed as a result of the overlapping emission from the lvc and the southern jet .",
    "figure  [ vx_pvds ] shows that the less - blueshifted side cutoff velocity of the lvc decreases ( becomes more blueshifted ) with @xmath24 . as a result , the velocity width of the lvc decreases with distance from irs  5 vla .",
    "it is also clear from figure  [ vx_pvds ] that this tendency is not significantly affected by the southern jet emission .",
    "thus , the velocity narrowing of the lvc along the outflow , which was pointed out in paper  i ( figure  2@xmath35 there ) , may be related only to the northern jet .",
    "we interpreted this tendency as due to the collimation of the lvc in paper  i , and that interpretation remains valid .",
    "the present slit scan observations provided unprecedented spatio - velocity information for the two jets emanating from irs  5 vla at the spatial and velocity resolutions of 04 and 60 km  s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this has enabled us to separate the northern and southern jets even in the close vicinity ( @xmath701@xmath2 ) of irs  5 vla ( figure  [ vx_pvds ] ) , although the two jets are discernible only at @xmath582@xmath2 away from irs  5 vla if no velocity information is available .",
    "there is no clear evidence to show which of the two irs  5 vla sources is responsible for the northern or southern jets .",
    "the northern and southern radio jets detected within @xmath51@xmath2 of irs  5 vla @xcite have pas of 247and 235respectively , which are similar to those of the northern ( 262 ) and southern ( 235 ) [ ]  jets .",
    "although the pa of the northern radio jet is somewhat smaller than that of the [ ]  jet , it bends toward the west at 07 west - southwest of the northern driving source and its pa changes to @xmath5260 , which agrees well with that of the northern [ ]  jet .",
    "if we assume that the northern and southern radio jets are smoothly connected to their respective [ ]  counterparts at @xmath51@xmath2 west of irs  5 vla , it is natural that the northern and southern radio jets are the inner parts of northern and southern [ ]  jets , respectively .    while the southern jet shows a single velocity component with a relatively narrow line width and little radial velocity variation , the spatial and velocity structure of the northern jet is more complicated .",
    "below , we summarize the characteristics of the northern jet revealed by our current and previous observations of the [ ]  @xmath01.644  @xmath1 m line .    1 .",
    "the northern jet covers a wide velocity range of @xmath8380 to 0 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "2 .   the position - velocity diagrams along and across the northern jet show two distinct components with different radial velocities : one is the hvc at a velocity of @xmath18300 km  s@xmath6  and the other is the lvc covering the velocity range of @xmath8240 to 0 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "3 .   the hvc shows a narrow line width with a deconvolved fwhm width of @xmath540 km  s@xmath6  ( see paper  i ) .",
    "4 .   the lvc shows a broad line width of 130160 km  s@xmath6  ( fwhm , see paper  i ) .",
    "this width is intrinsic to the lvc of the northern jet and is not caused by the contamination from the southern jet ( see item 6 of  [ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "the lvc shows a spatial width of @xmath5065 at its more - blueshifted velocity side ( @xmath40200 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "this width is similar to that of the hvc .",
    "the lvc has a larger spatial width ( @xmath5085 ) at its less - blueshifted velocity side ( @xmath4030 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "an important issue to consider is whether the hvc and lvc of the northern jet represent two types of jets from a single driving source or merely an inner and an outer part of a single jet .",
    "we discussed this in papers  i and ii , with preference to the presence of two outflows from a single driving source .",
    "this is because the hvc and lvc are identified as two distinct peaks in the pvds and show different kinematical characteristics as typically seen in their velocity widths .",
    "the hvc and lvc are , on the other hand , not easily discernible in the channel maps of figure  [ channelmaps ] , which might suggest that the hvc and lvc are smoothly connected .",
    "however , we should note that it is difficult to theoretically simulate pvds with two distinct peaks under the assumption of monotonically increasing or decreasing variation of physical conditions from the jet axis to its outer annuli .",
    "the two distinct peaks in the pvds may thus imply that there are two different radial regions flowing at different velocities in the northern jet , if axial symmetry holds , and that the two annuli emit equally strong [ ]  emission , even if they are part of a single outflow .",
    "another point that has to be stressed is that the hvc always shows a narrow line width , while the lvc has a larger line width for the four [ ]  jets so far observed at sufficiently high spatial and spectroscopic resolutions .",
    "table  [ velocity_width ] summarizes the deconvolved velocity widths ( fwhm ) of the hvcs and lvcs for those [ ]  jets .",
    "the hvcs of the jets from dg  tau , rw  aur , and hl  tau are conspicuous and are easily identified in their pvds .",
    "they all show a width of @xmath550 km  s@xmath6  with their blueshifted radial velocities of @xmath5200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the lvc of the dg  tau jet is extended and its broad velocity width is clearly seen in figures  1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "the lvcs of rw  aur and hl  tau are compact and are detected as less - blueshifted wing or shoulder emission at or near the positions of their driving sources .",
    "these two lvcs do not show distinct peaks in their pvds , although the l1551 irs  5 northern and dg  tau jets do .",
    "the lvc emission from all these sources fills the radial velocity range between the hvc and @xmath50  km  s@xmath6 , suggesting a velocity width of 100  km  s@xmath6  or larger .",
    "the southern jet of l1551 irs  5 is , in this sense , categorized as an hvc .",
    "this is based on its typical deconvolved velocity width of 53 km  s@xmath6  and extended geometry , and is as listed in table  [ velocity_width ] .",
    "the current paradigm of magnetocentrifugally accelerated outflow models predicts that the terminal velocity of a jet is mainly determined by the alfvn radius , within which the magnetic field lines work as lever arms @xcite .",
    "thus , the narrow velocity width of a jet indicates that the line - emitting gas is launched within a narrow radial range of an accretion disk , while the broad velocity width of a jet ( after it becomes collimated ) implies a wider range of launching radius .",
    "on the basis of this assumption , @xcite suggested that the hvcs of rw  aur and hl  tau should be launched from a narrow range of radius or that only such outflowing gas originating from a narrow radial range should be sufficiently excited to contribute to the line emission .",
    "the same interpretation can be applied for the hvcs from l1551 irs  5 and dg  tau , judging by the similarities of their hvcs to those of rw  aur and hl  tau .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lvcs show a velocity width 24 times larger than the hvcs ( table  [ velocity_width ] ) , meaning that the lvc - emitting gas is launched from the wider outer radial range of an accretion disk if the streamlines are collimated ; i.e. the lvc is extended more than a few tens of au from their driving sources . because this length scale corresponds to @xmath502 at the assumed distance of 140  pc ,",
    "the spatially extended lvcs observed for the northern jet of l1551 irs  5 and the dg  tau jet are consistent with the outflow launched from a larger radial range of an accretion disk .",
    "there is also a possibility that the spatially compact lvcs toward rw  aur and hl  tau may have arisen in a region where the streamlines are not yet collimated .    in summary",
    ", the presence of spatially extended hvcs and lvcs with very different kinematical characteristics suggests two types of outflows from a single driving source : the hvc is launched from an inner , narrow region of an accretion disk and the lvc from an outer , wider region .",
    "figure  [ schematic ] shows a schematic diagram showing the launching radii of the hvc and lvc for the northern jet of l1551 irs  5 .",
    "we simply assumed a keplerian - rotating accretion disk around a 1  m@xmath71 star with the alfvn radius three times that of the launching point radius along each magnetic line of force .",
    "the hvc with a narrow velocity width is launched in a very small radial range from 0.04 to 0.05  au from the star , while the lvc with a broader velocity width is launched in a radial range from 0.1 to 4.5  au , 400 times larger radial range than that of the hvc .",
    "the regions responsible for the hvc and lvc are spatially separated on the accretion disk .",
    "if both the hvc and lvc arise from a single outflow launched continuously over a radial range from 0.04 to 4.5  au , we must seek physical and chemical conditions on the disk surface to heat up the gas along the two separated groups of streamlines .",
    "instead , if we assume two mechanisms working simultaneously  for example , if the hvc is driven by an @xmath20-wind type mechanism and the lvc is driven by a disk - wind type mechanism ",
    "it may be possible to have the two emitting gases along the two independent streamline groups as shown in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "one of the interesting results of our current observations is shown in figure  [ channelmaps ] , where the lvc itself shows a variation in spatial width that varies with radial velocity , as quantitatively measured and listed in table  [ jet_width ] .",
    "the spatial width of the lvc is @xmath5065 in its very - blueshifted velocity channels ( figures  [ channelmaps]@xmath45 and [ channelmaps]@xmath46 ) , while it is @xmath5085 at its less - blueshifted velocity channels , shown in figures  [ channelmaps]@xmath49 and [ channelmaps]@xmath50 .",
    "the difference in the spatial width of the lvc with velocity provides observational evidence that slower - velocity gas flows along outer and more widely - opened streamlines .",
    "this may support the idea that the lvc ( but not the hvc ) of the l1551 irs  5 northern jet is an outflow launched over a wide radial range of an accretion disk .",
    "alternatively , part of the lvc - emitting gas flowing in the vicinity of the hvc may arise in the shocked gas entrained by the hvc .",
    "the similar spatial width of the hvc compared to that of the very - blueshifted part ( @xmath52200  km  s@xmath6 ) of the lvc may imply that the gas responsible for this part of the lvc flows immediately outside the hvc with a velocity difference of @xmath5100 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the two flows may interact to produce the fainter `` pedestal '' emission connecting the hvc and lvc in the pvds .",
    "we discussed in paper  i a possibility that the pedestal emission and the `` red wing emission '' at @xmath7225 are produced as a result of turbulent entrainment of the lvc gas .",
    "the pedestal emission has a velocity ( @xmath52200  km  s@xmath6 ) similar to the secondary peak velocity ( @xmath52180  km  s@xmath6 ) of the h@xmath73 emission taken toward the base of the northern jet @xcite and the red wing emission shows a tendency of apparent acceleration with distance from irs  5 vla .",
    "these characteristics favor the idea of pedestal and red wing emissions arising in the gas entrained by the hvc flow . on the other hand ,",
    "the main part of the lvc does not exhibit such apparent acceleration along the flow , although it does show velocity narrowing ( figure  [ vx_pvds ] ) , and is not affected by the time variation that was observed in the hvc at 0@xmath741@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that it is difficult to consider the entire lvc emission as arising from the entrained gas .",
    "we also pointed out in paper  ii that the spatially wide subcomponent of the lvc ( lvc@xmath68 ) can not be considered as arising from a bow shock because there is no systematic velocity difference or gradient between the lvc and lvc@xmath68 . on the other hand , the h@xmath13 v=10 s(1 ) emission is less blueshifted ( @xmath7560  km  s@xmath6 ) than [ ]  and has a steadily increasing velocity component along the flow @xcite , suggesting that it originates from the gas entrained by the lvc or lvc@xmath68 .",
    "another possibility that the significant part of the lvc flow is a shock - decelerated hvc gas will be discussed below in relation to the x - ray emission .",
    "finally , we should note that there is a third object recently discovered at 009 southeast of the northern binary component @xcite .",
    "the possibility that this third object contributes to either of the hvc or lvc is small because there is no hard evidence of an associated radio jet ; the hvc and lvc of the l1551 irs  5 northern jet are driven by a single source .",
    "the hvc and lvc show exactly the same pas as seen in figure  [ channelmaps ] and both are spatially confined around the @xmath24-axis ( @xmath760@xmath2 ) even at @xmath774@xmath2 ( see figure  3@xmath27 of paper  ii ) .",
    "this level of alignment between the hvc and lvc is rather unlikely if different driving sources are responsible for the hvc and lvc .",
    "the peak of the hvc emission is systematically shifted to the positive @xmath20 direction by 0102 with respect to that of the lvc at each position of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for this is unknown , but such a systematical shift may also be unnatural if the hvc and lvc originate from different driving sources .",
    "the soft x - ray emission associated with l1551 irs  5 was first detected by @xcite with _ xmm - newton _ , although the spatial resolution was not sufficient to pinpoint the actual location of the x - ray source on the jets .",
    "subsequently , @xcite located an x - ray source at 0@xmath2351@xmath14 west of irs  5 vla from _ chandra _ observations .",
    "this raised the possibility that the x - ray emission comes from phk1 , and @xcite proposed several models on this basis . because the actual location of the x - ray source is still uncertain , we re - examined the location of the x - ray emission peak .",
    "we confirm in this paper that the _ h_-band continuum peak , which agrees with the _ k_-band peak within an uncertainty of 025 , is located 06 east - northeast of phk1 and the distance did not change between the two observing epochs separated by four years . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reported that the published infrared position for irs  5 is about 0@xmath235 or more east of the x - ray source .",
    "these two measurements suggest that the peak position of the x - ray emission coincides with phk1 within an uncertainty of @xmath503 .",
    "note that this result does not rely on the radio position of irs  5 vla , which has a larger positional uncertainty as a result of a larger registration error between the optical and radio reference frames .",
    "@xcite reported ( based on their new _",
    "observations ) that a stronger , point - like component of the x - ray source did not show any detectable proper motion , while a weaker component expanded in size by @xmath5300  au over four years , which corresponds to the projected velocity of @xmath5330  kms@xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these facts with another set of findings showing that the proper motion of phk1 was not detected between the two epochs of observations in 2000 and 2004 , while the hvc of the northern jet has a radial velocity of @xmath5300  kms@xmath6 , which is equal to the projected velocity if we assume a jet inclination angle of 45@xmath22 .",
    "such similarities strengthen the possibility that the point - like x - ray emission originates in phk1 and further implies that the hvc , but not the lvc , is responsible ( at least ) for the extended x - ray component .",
    "the extended and rapidly expanding x - ray component might be related to the newly seen knot at @xmath24=06 in figure  [ feii ] .",
    "the mechanism of the x - ray emission near phk1 is still unclear .",
    "the radial velocity of the hvc ( 260350 km  s@xmath6 ) corresponds to the actual velocity of 370500 km  s@xmath6  with the above assumed inclination .",
    "such an outflow has sufficiently high energy to produce a plasma of 10@xmath7810@xmath79 k responsible for the x - ray emission when thermalized in a fast shock @xcite . because the highly collimated hvc is present at phk1 and in the region farther away from the driving source",
    ", it may be difficult to assume that the hvc is fully thermalized at phk1 .",
    "however , the spatial coincidence of the hvc with the lvc ( with its large velocity dispersion of 240 km  s@xmath6  around phk1 ) might imply that part of the hvc is thermalized to produce the x - ray emission and lvc .",
    "in such a case , a significant part of the lvc might be shock - decelerated hvc gas .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the l1551 irs  5 vla sources and the _ h_-band continuum peak are located 12 and 06 , respectively , east - northeast of the strongest [ ] knot phk1 along the northern jet .",
    "the relative position of phk1 with respect to the _ h_-band continuum peak did not show any variation between the two observing epochs in 2000 and 2004 , suggesting that phk1 is stationary .",
    "the southern jet significantly contributes to the [ ]  flux at phk1 .",
    "it has a constant velocity of @xmath80=@xmath8120 km  s@xmath6  with a comparatively narrow velocity width of 53 km  s@xmath6  ( deconvolved fwhm ) , and is traced as close as 06 from the irs  5 vla sources .",
    "3 .    the high- and low - velocity components ( hvc and lvc ) of the northern jet are clearly separated in position - velocity diagrams .",
    "the lvc shows a wide velocity coverage from @xmath8240 to 0 km  s@xmath6  with a deconvolved fwhm width of 150180 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "it has a spatial width of 0607 , similar to that of the hvc , at its more - blueshifted velocity ( @xmath18200 km  s@xmath6 ) , while it shows a wider spatial width of 0809 at its less - blueshifted velocity ( @xmath1830 km  s@xmath6 ) 4 .",
    "the high velocity and narrow line width of the hvc implies that its launching point is located over a narrow radial range in the inner part of an accretion disk , while the wide line width of the lvc means that it is launched from a wider radial range if it is also launched from the accretion disk .",
    "the variation of the spatial width with velocity observed for the lvc suggests that slower gas flows in an outer annulus with a wider opening angle .",
    "the velocity of the hvc shows a time variation between the two observing epochs in 2000 and 2004 .",
    "the position of the stationary , point - like x - ray source with respect to the near - infrared position of l1551 irs  5 indicates that it coincides with phk1 within an uncertainty of 03 .",
    "the projected expanding velocity of the weaker , extended component of the x - ray emission agrees well with the hvc velocity .",
