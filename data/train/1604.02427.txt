    "these topological boundary states are the prime physical consequence of the topology of the bulk band structure , which is encoded in a quantized topological invariant.@xcite    belonging to the symplectic class aii of the altland - zirnbauer ( az ) classification , time - reversal invariant topological insulators in two ( 2d ) and three dimensions ( 3d ) are characterized by a @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "primary examples of topologically nontrivial systems include hgte / cdte quantum wells in 2d,@xcite and bi@xmath1se@xmath2 in 3d.@xcite for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , instead , the az scheme does not predict a similar topological invariant , and thus all insulating phases are expected to be topologically equivalent .    in the context of recent findings of novel topological states of matter protected by additional continuous symmetries,@xcite",
    "we show here that a crystalline symmetry , namely mirror symmetry , leads to a class of 1d time - reversal invariant topological insulators beyond the standard az classification of topological insulators . using the concept of partial polarizations ,",
    "we demonstrate that the concomitant presence of mirror and time - reversal symmetry allows the definition of a @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "a nonzero value of this invariant defines a one - dimensional topological mirror insulator , which hosts an odd number of integer electronic end charges .",
    "we will present an explicit tight - binding model built upon the well - known aubry - andr - harper ( aah ) model realizing this novel topological state of matter . by calculating its topological invariants",
    ", we determine the phase diagram of the system .",
    "moreover , we consider energy spectra of finite chains and calculate the corresponding values of the end charges to explicitly confirm the topological nature and the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "we further study the effect of weak on - site disorder .",
    "we find that the topological features are robust as long as mirror symmetry is preserved on average .",
    "we finally show that a particular realization of this model can be achieved in cold atomic fermi gases loaded in 1d optical lattices and in semiconductor nanowires with gate - modulated rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we start out by considering a generic system of spin one - half fermions in a 1d crystalline potential with time - reversal symmetry @xmath3 . in addition",
    ", we will consider the crystal to be mirror symmetric with respect to a 1d mirror point .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian of such a system @xmath4 , where @xmath5 $ ] with the lattice constant set to unity , then inherits the two following symmetry constraints : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the antiunitary time - reversal operator , while @xmath8 is the unitary operator corresponding to the operation of reflection with respect to the 1d mirror point . without loss of generality , we assume the latter to be in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 are the usual pauli matrices acting in spin space , while @xmath11 acts only on the spatial degrees of freedom and thus corresponds to spatial inversion . for this representation of the symmetry operations",

    "because of the intrinsic @xmath18 ambiguity of the berry phase , @xmath19 is defined up to an integer and can generally assume any value in between .",
    "however , this assertion does not hold true for a 1d insulator with a 1d mirror point . to show this , we first exploit the time - reversal symmetry of the system and consider the _ partial polarizations",

    "the crux of the story is that in presence of mirror symmetry with the symmetry operator @xmath26 commuting with the time - reversal symmetry operator , the partial polarizations satisfy @xmath27 [ c.f .",

    "henceforth , @xmath28 can only assume the two distinct values @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( modulo an integer ) .",
    "the consequence of this result is twofold .",
    "first , it follows that the charge polarization @xmath31 of a 1d insulator with a 1d mirror point is an integer quantity .",
    "second , the quantized nature of the partial polarization allows to define a @xmath0 topological invariant @xmath32 .",
    "this gives rise to two topologically distinct states that can not be adiabatically connected without closing the bulk energy gap or breaking the defining symmetries .",

    "the quantization of the partial polarization in one - dimensional systems with a mirror point has a direct physical consequence .",
    "the charge polarization of a system is indeed directly connected to the accumulated bound charge at its surfaces.@xcite for a one - dimensional system the end charge @xmath40 is simply related to the polarization @xmath41 by @xmath42 . since the partial polarization @xmath43 is just the usual polarization associated with one of the time - reversed channels , we can assign a _ partial _",

    "the partial polarization can therefore be used as a topological @xmath0 invariant . if this number is nonzero , the system is a topological mirror insulator whose hallmark is an odd number of electronic end charges .",
    "furthermore , these end charges are robust against weak disorder as long as the protecting mirror symmetry is preserved on average .",
    "we have checked these findings against a class of models , corresponding to generalized aah models with soc that realize topologically nontrivial @xmath0 phases .",
    "these models can be realized in fermi gases loaded in periodical optical lattices , as well as in semiconductor nanowires with perpendicular modulated voltage gates . in the latter setup",

    "in the following , we briefly review the concept of partial polarization and show that its value is quantized in the presence of reflection symmetry .",
    "let us start with the general charge polarization @xmath19 .",
    "it is a measure for the electric dipole moment per unit cell and can be elegantly written in terms of the berry connection@xcite : @xmath145 with the @xmath146 berry s connection @xmath147 here , @xmath148 is the lattice - periodic part of a bloch state at momentum @xmath20 and band index @xmath149 , @xmath150 is the lattice constant , @xmath151 is the electron charge , and the sum is over all occupied bands . since the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is equivalent to the famous berry phase  @xcite times a factor , @xmath19 is in general only defined up to an integer and can assume any value in between .    in the context of time - reversal invariant topological insulators , fu and kane introduced the notion of _ partial polarization _  @xcite . for this , they made use of the well - known kramers theorem : for a time - reversal symmetric system with half - integer total spin , every energy level is evenly degenerate .",
    "for a translationally invariant system this is equivalent to saying that every bloch state at @xmath20 comes with a time - reversed degenerate partner at @xmath21 . in particular , states at the time - reversal invariant momenta @xmath60 and @xmath152",
    "must be evenly degenerate .",
    "hence , a fully gapped system must have an even number of occupied energy bands .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , there are no other degeneracies than those required by time - reversal symmetry , we can divide the @xmath34 occupied bands into @xmath109 pairs subject to  @xcite @xmath153 where @xmath3 is the antiunitary time - reversal operator with @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and i ,  ii are the two time - reversed channels .",
    "then , the partial polarizations are simply the polarizations associated with the two channels , i.e. , @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",

    "the topological invariant defined in eq .   requires a continuous gauge . in the following",
    ", we are going to present a method to construct such a gauge from numerically obtained eigenstates of a 1d system .",
    "the discussion closely follows the appendix of ref .  .",
    "let us consider an isolated set of @xmath109 bands , i.e. , the bands can cross each other but shall have no crossings with other bands outside the considered set . furthermore , consider a discrete uniform @xmath20 mesh of @xmath182 points @xmath183 , @xmath184 $ ] , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 with a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath187 .",
    "we label the corresponding eigenstates along the mesh @xmath188 , where @xmath149 is the band index .",
    "if these states are obtained from a numerical diagonalization routine , they will in general have random phases .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath189 such a choice of phases is highly non - differentiable .    in order to construct a smooth numerical gauge",
    ", we have to define what we mean by `` smooth '' for a discrete mesh .",
    "this can be done by requiring that the states remain as parallel as possible as we move along a path from @xmath190 to @xmath191 . in other words ,",
    "the change in the states should be orthogonal to the states themselves .",
    "the corresponding gauge is called _ parallel transport gauge_. for a single isolated band this can be realized by choosing the phases of the bloch states such that the overlap @xmath192 is real and positive . for @xmath109 bands ,",
    "one has to require that the overlap matrix @xmath193 is hermitian with only positive eigenvalues .",
    "we are now going to explain how a parallel - transport gauge can be constructed in practice .",
    "we start from the initial point @xmath194 where we set @xmath195 .",
    "then , at each subsequent @xmath196 we have to rotate the states @xmath197 by a unitary matrix @xmath198 in such a way that the overlap matrix @xmath199 becomes hermitian and positive .",
    "this is accomplished by employing a singular value decomposition .",
    "more specifically , @xmath199 can be written as @xmath200 , where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are unitary and @xmath203 is positive real diagonal .",
    "if we now set @xmath204 and transform the states as @xmath205 the new overlap matrix becomes @xmath206 , which is hermitian and positive . repeating this for the entire @xmath20 mesh",
    ", we finally get a set of states @xmath207 that are smooth in the sense specified above .",
    "however , states at @xmath190 and @xmath191 will in general differ by a unitary transformation @xmath208 and are , thus , not mapped onto themselves via parallel transport .",
    "the matrix @xmath208 corresponds to a non - abelian analog of the berry phase and has eigenvalues of the form @xmath209 .",
    "the periodicity can be restored in the following way : we first determine the unitary matrix @xmath210 that diagonalizes @xmath208 .",
    "we then rotate all states at all @xmath211 by @xmath210 .",
    "this results in a gauge in which the new states correspond to a diagonal @xmath208 with eigenvalues @xmath212 .",
    "finally , we spread the residual phase differences over the @xmath20 mesh , @xmath213 eventually , we have constructed a smooth , periodic gauge for the set of @xmath109 bands .",
    "note , however , that the new states @xmath214 are in general not eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , at each @xmath211 they span the eigenspace corresponding to the @xmath109 bands .",
    "they can therefore be used for the calculation of @xmath181-invariant quantities like the partial polarization ."
