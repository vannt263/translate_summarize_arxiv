    "the bicep2 collaboration reports the signal of gravitational waves in the b - mode power spectrum in spatially flat spacetimes@xcite .",
    "these tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves ) arises from infaltionary in the early universe . as is well known ,",
    "gravitational waves propagate freely in the expanding universe with this assumption that the universe is perfect fluid @xcite and also the cosmological generation of gravitational waves was considered by l.p.grishchuk @xcite and a.a.starobinsky@xcite . even though in wmap nine - year data report the results",
    "have been interpreted as an evidence in the support of flat universe , in no way do the data rule out the case of @xmath2@xcite . by choosing the maximally extended de - sitter metric as unperturbed background",
    ", we found the evolution of tensor modes fluctuation in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "we compute only the tensor mode fluctuation between the time of inflation and present specially from a temperature  @xmath3 when electron positron annihilation is substantially complete and neutrinos have decoupled from matter and radiation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the neutrino contribution to the anisotropic inertia tensor @xmath4 so that for calculation of high accuracy it is necessary to use the boltzmann equations of kinetic theory for neutrinos in phase space and then get the integro - differential equation of tensor mode fluctuation in closed cosmology . in sec.iii , we discuss short wavelengths re - entering the horizon during the radiation dominated phase because modes are time - independent when leaving the horizon . in sec.iv , we present the gw s equation in matter dominated era and discuss the effects of free streaming neutrinos on it . in last section",
    "we conclude with discussing and comparing the results of flat @xcite,@xcite and closed cosmology .",
    "in general the tensor mode gravitational perturbation takes the form @xmath5 and the tensor fluctuation in curved spacetime satisfies@xcite @xmath6 for which the dot stands for derivative with respect to the ordinary time , @xmath7 is curvature constant and @xmath8 is anisotropic inertia tensor . in the perfect fluids and independent of the background space time",
    "the interaction of tensor modes with matter and radiation is zero @xcite , but there is a traceless transverse term in the anisotropic tensor so @xmath9 is only the anisotropic part of the stress tensor that is the spatial part of the perturbed energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 or @xmath11 where @xmath12 is unperturbed pressure .",
    "the components of the perturbed metric in cartesian coordinate are @xcite @xmath13 if we consider only tensor perturbation so that @xmath14 the anisotropic inertia tensor is the sum of the contributions from photons and neutrinos but photons have a small contribution to the anisotropic inertia due to a short mean free time and neutrinos traveling without collisions when temperature dropped about @xmath15 so neutrino distribution function in phase space has a form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is individual neutrinos and anti neutrino trajectories . in the absence of collisions terms , boltzmann equation for neutrinos would be @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rate of the change of momentum and the rate of change of the coordinate respectively , so the above relation will be @xmath21 @xmath22 in the start of free streaming has the form of the ideal gas : @xmath23\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the number of types of neutrinos and separately antineutrinos and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant . with a small perturbation to the metric , the neutrino disturbation function gets a small difference from its equilibrium form as @xmath26 if the background spacetime is non - flat@xmath27 so @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are of independent variable @xmath31 by @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "to first order in metric and density perturbation eq.([1 ] ) will be @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the relativistic boltzmann equation for the perturbation @xmath37 in curved spacetime will be @xmath38 we use a dimensionless intensity perturbation @xmath39 , defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of species of neutrinos and antineutrinos and @xmath42 and also with @xmath43 the boltzmann equation ( [ 2 ] ) becomes @xmath44 the above equation can be have a solution in the following form @xmath45 and also we define @xmath46 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a stochastic parameter for the single non - decaying mode with discrete wave number @xmath49 and the helicity @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the corresponding polarization tensor . with @xmath52 and working in @xmath53 , eq.([3 ] ) becomes an equation for @xmath54 : @xmath55 and we can find a solution of above equation with green function method as @xmath56 the green function is obtained as @xmath57 in this case @xmath58 is @xmath59 \\theta(\\tau^{\\prime}q-2\\tau q ) e^{i\\tau^{\\prime } q(\\mu^{\\prime}+ 2\\tau^{\\prime}q)}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the tensor mode , the only nonvanishing component is @xmath60 : @xmath61 this is the neutrino contribution of the anisotropic inertia tensor @xmath62 : @xmath63 \\nonumber\\\\&\\times & \\int _ { -1}^{+1}d\\mu^{\\prime } \\int_{0}^{\\tau q } d\\tau^{\\prime}[-2\\dot{d}_{q}(\\tau^{\\prime } ) ] e^{i\\tau^{\\prime } q(\\mu^{\\prime}+ 2\\tau^{\\prime}q)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the right hand side , the second and third terms compared with the first term are too small so by ignoring them , the integro - differential equation of gravitational waves in the presence of inertia tensor of neutrinos becomes @xmath64\\dfrac{\\sin \\tau^{'}q}{\\tau^{'}q } e^{2i\\tau^{\\prime 2 } q^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side of the equation ( [ 7 ] ) is more complicated than the case of flat spacetime . in the next section",
    "we will calculate the decay of gravitational waves in the radiation dominated era .",
    "we found a complete solution of differential equation for tensor perturbation in the closed universe@xcite .",
    "we begin by neglecting the anisotropic inertia tensor @xmath4 and then we consider @xmath65 so with this approximation , the field equation ( [ 4 ] ) governing the fourier components of the tensor components of @xmath66 becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is discrete . to treat the evolution of @xmath70 , it is convenient to change the independent variable @xmath71 to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the value of the robertson - walker scale factor at matter - radiation equality . from friedmann equation",
    "we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the expansion rate at matter - radiation equality , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are vacuum and curvature energy respectively when radiation and matter are equal .    to investigate a short enough wavelength to have re - entered the horizon during the radiation dominated era , we consider @xmath78 the equation([6 ] ) with the change of variable from @xmath79 to @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath69 is discrete number . for @xmath83",
    "the solution is @xmath84 and general solution is @xmath85 the solution is similar to the flat case but @xmath86 depends on discrete number @xmath69 in closed universe .",
    "the fraction of the total energy density in neutrinos is @xmath87 where @xmath88 and the third term in the denominator is too small and can be ignored . in the presence of the anisotropic inertia tensor with change @xmath89 instead of @xmath79 and using the friedmann equation @xmath90 , the gravitational wave equation([7 ] ) in radiation dominated era becomes @xmath91 when @xmath92 the homogeneous solution is constant value of @xmath93 then @xmath94 so the gravitational waves equation becomes @xmath95 the solution is identical to the flat spacetime but for @xmath96 when the tensor modes are deep inside the horizon , the integro - differential equation ( [ 8 ] ) becomes @xmath97 and its general solution is @xmath98 where @xmath93 is constant and @xmath99 is the cosine integral as @xmath100",
    ". deep inside of horizon when @xmath101 , the right hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ 101 ] ) becomes negligible and the solution approaches a homogeneous solution as @xmath102 for large @xmath103 , @xmath99 and the third term of the general solution tend to zero so @xmath104",
    ". also a numerical solution of eq.([101 ] ) shows that @xmath105 follows the @xmath106 solution pretty accurately until @xmath107 when the perturbation enters horizon [ as compared with the solution @xmath108 for @xmath106 ] and thereafter the solution rapidly approaches to the @xmath110 .",
    "so then the effect of neutrino damping reduces the tensor amplitude by the factor of @xmath111 in the closed cosmology while in the flat case the factor was @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "hence the tensor contribution to the temperature multipole coefficient @xmath113 and the whole of the @xmath114 polarization multipole coefficient @xmath115 will be @xmath116 less than they would be without damping due to free -streaming neutrinos . therefore in the radiation dominated era and in closed cosmology , the amplitude of the gravitational waves in presence of neutrinos will be less than the flat case or neutrinos have a greater effect on the damping of gravitational waves in closed cosmology as shown in fig.1 .",
    "to investigate the tensor perturbation may enter horizon after the matter energy density becomes important , we consider @xmath117 so from ( [ 10 ] ) we have @xmath118 where @xmath76 is vacuum energy at the equality of radiation and matter .",
    "using @xmath119 and @xmath120 equation ( [ 6 ] ) becomes @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath69 is discrete number .",
    "this equation is different from gravitational waves equation in flat cosmology @xcite . whatever the value of @xmath123 , the general solution is @xmath124-c_{n}^{0}[\\dfrac{\\kappa}{y } \\sin(\\dfrac{\\kappa}{y})+\\cos(\\dfrac{\\kappa}{y})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are constant .",
    "the solution is not oscillating in @xmath127 and the neutrinos have no effect on the gravitational waves .",
    "also we impose the condition that the solution should approach the constant of the value @xmath126 for @xmath128 so the solution will be @xmath129\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar to the flat spacetime , all wavelength to take the gravitational wave amplitude in matter - dominated era are to be given by multiplying the above solution with the factor @xmath130 : @xmath131\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath127 because the damping effect is equal to zero for @xmath127 .",
    "therefore we can consider @xmath135 and amplitude of gravitational waves will be reduced by the factor @xmath130 .",
    "at first we obtained the relativistic boltzmann equation for perturbation @xmath136 in spatially closed cosmology , the perturbation on the metric background creates a disturbance in the number density of neutrinos and then we investigate the effects of anisotropic inertia tensor on the damping of gravitational waves in the radiation and matter dominated era .",
    "amplitude of gravitational waves is a sensitive function of discrete wave number . during the radiation dominated era when",
    "the tensor perturbation re - entered the horizon , the effect of neutrinos on gws in flat spacetime is weaker than the closed case and the evolution is independent of any cosmological parameters . in closed cosmology , in matter - dominated era the equation of gravitational waves is different from the flat case and the propagating of the gravitational waves will be different from the flat case and the effect is less for wavelengths that enter the horizon at later times . the evolution of gws at later times after the radiation - matter equality depends on vacuum energy in the equality of matter and radiation",
