    "breathers are localized oscillations in coupled networks of nonlinear oscillators @xcite .",
    "they have been extensively studied in the last years @xcite . under some conditions they can move easily along the network while maintaining their localization @xcite . a physical system where they may play a significant role is dna , because the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides are highly nonlinear and their openings can be related to biological processes such as transcription , replication and , in the case of mbs , with the transport of information , energy and charge @xcite .",
    "dna is also a flexible chain , and the question arises of to what extent mbs are hindered in their movement by the points of bending , or if , on the other hand , these points may have a biological role by trapping breathers and accumulating their energy .",
    "the shape of the dna molecule is felt because the hydrogen bond is a polar one , and the dipolar interaction between the dipoles is a long - range one which depends on the distances and orientations of the dipoles , and , therefore , on the shape .",
    "soliton properties in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation framework with dipole - dipole interaction have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , among others , whereas mbs in dna klein - gordon models have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and their interaction with bending points in ref .",
    "a problem for these studies is the fairly large number of physical parameters that are not well known , among them , crucially , the coefficient of dipole interaction . in this paper we present new quantum chemical calculation that lead to the value of this parameter and investigate its consequences .",
    "moreover , the reduction of the number of parameters allow us to explore the variation of another one , the breather frequency , which previously was considered as fixed .",
    "the only quantity that it is needed to implement the dipole  dipole interaction is the _ charge transfer _ @xmath0 .",
    "it is defined in the following way : if @xmath1 is the dipole moment of a watson - crick hydrogen bond at the equilibrium distance , and it is stretched by a small amount @xmath2 , the new dipole moment is given to the first order in @xmath2 by @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant estimations have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , yielding @xmath0 values between @xmath4 and @xmath5 for an a - t base pair and between @xmath6 and @xmath7for a g - c base pair , depending on the quantum - chemical method used .",
    "however , these values were obtained only for watson - crick base pairs _ in vacuo_. in the present work we significantly extend our model , in that we take into account    \\a ) the variation of the dipole moment of the whole nucleoside ( base + deoxyribose ) pair ,    \\b ) the influence of the dna duplex environment on dipole moments of the nucleoside pairs in question .",
    "we also consider the helical structure of the dna double strand .",
    "the procedure now is as follows : we consider regular homogeneous stacked trimers of nucleoside pairs , namely , adeninosine - thymidine ( at ) and guanosine - cytidine ( gc ) pairs in the following arrangement : at / at / at and gc / gc / gc .",
    "we take the effective dipole moment of a nucleoside base pair to be one third of the trimer dipole moment .",
    "then we stretch and squeeze h - bonds by gradually adding or subtracting of up to 0.1 angstrom to the equilibrium spacing between a and t ( or g and c ) in the central pair of the trimer , with the two flanking pairs remaining in the standard b - dna - conformation . at each of the h - bond stretching / squeezing states , the effective dipole moment of a nucleoside pair was estimated using semiempirical quantum chemistry .",
    "the relevant computational details are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we evaluate a linear regression of the effective dipole moment ( @xmath8 ) onto the nucleotide spacing change ( @xmath2 ) in the watson - crick pairs ( @xmath3 ) , where the coefficient @xmath0 , delivers the desired estimate . as a result , we have obtained @xmath9 , @xmath10 , for the at pair and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , for the gc pair .",
    "the watson - crick h - bond stretching diminishes the effective dipole moment of nucleoside pairs , which ought to be connected with the proper changes in the purine - pyrimidine molecular orbital overlap included into quantum - chemical evaluations of dipole moments .",
    "if we take into account only the conventional electrostatic charge distributions , increasing the spacing between the partners in the watson - crick base pair should lead to the increase in the dipole moment .",
    "note that the values of @xmath0 obtained in this way are substantially larger than the ones obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and very similar for both the a - t and g - c pairs , in spite of the different number of hydrogen bonds .",
    "this could be explained by the appreciable influence of the dna duplex surrounding on the watson - crick a - t and g - c base pair dipole moments .",
    "we agree that taking an `` effective '' dipole moment of the stacked base pair trimer is only an approximation .",
    "we intended to include the coupling between the nearest neighbours in the dna stack . that the `` effective '' dipole moment values differ from those of the isolated base pairs",
    "is actually a significant result showing that we were right to include the dna stacking interactions at least approximately into our model . as to the coulomb electron - electron interaction ,",
    "it was considered at our hartree - fock - level quantum - chemical calculations in the form of pauli correlations , where electrons of the same spin are repellent .",
    "note also that being the values of @xmath0 for both homopolynucleotide duplexes very similar we should not expect @xmath0 to change significatively for heterogeneous dna .",
    "the hamiltonian system also used in ref .",
    "@xcite is a peyrard  bishop model  @xcite augmented with long - range interaction .",
    "it can be written as :    @xmath13    the explanation of the terms and variables is as follows : @xmath14 is the stretching of the @xmath15-th hydrogen bond ; @xmath16 is the reduced mass of a nucleotide pair ; the morse potential @xmath17 , represents the energy of a hydrogen bond between a pair of nucleotides ; @xmath18 is the stacking energy between neighboring bonds ; @xmath19 is the energy of the dipole  dipole interaction ; if @xmath20 is a vector that denotes the position of each particle in the 2-d space , @xmath21 , for @xmath22 and @xmath23 otherwise , where @xmath24 , hereafter referred to as the dipole parameter , is given by @xmath25 , @xmath0 and @xmath26   , being the charge transfer and the distance between neighbouring base pairs , respectively , as deduced in ref .",
    "we approximate the shape of the molecule in the vicinity of a bending point by a parabola with curvature @xmath27 embedded in a plane , and consider the dipoles with the same orientation and orthogonal to it .",
    "we consider fixed geometry as the h  bond vibrations are much faster than the bending movement .",
    "thus , @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "we also neglect the heterogeneity of dna .",
    "the values of the parameters are taken from ref .",

    "breathers , exact to machine precision , are calculated numerically using techniques based in the anti - continuous limit  @xcite .",

    "the particles of the breather oscillate coherently with a frequency @xmath44 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we define the non - dimensional frequency @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , defined through @xmath47 is the linear frequency of the isolated oscillators in eq .",
    "[ ham ] . as the on  site potential is soft , @xmath48 .",
    "we have limited its values to the interval @xmath49 because lower frequencies brings about breathers difficult to move , due to their small width , and mb with larger ones develop frequencies which interact with the phonon band .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that mbs are a wave packet with frequencies around the one of the perturbed static breather .    for a given value of the breather frequency @xmath41 ,",
    "mbs exist for values of @xmath34 above a critical one @xmath50 , for which the inversion of stability takes place .",
    "this value has to be calculated numerically .",
    "the phonon band is composed of the frequencies of the linear modes , given by  @xcite:@xmath51 where @xmath0 is the wave number , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the polylogarithmic or jonquire function . they exist for increasing values of @xmath54 until an upper limit @xmath55 , for which the top of the phonon band , at @xmath56 , reaches the second harmonic of the breather .",
    "@xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the riemann s zeta - function .",
    "this is also the upper limit for mbs existence .",
    "[ fig : stabbif ] shows the range of existence of mbs .",
    "it can be seen that they exist for a wide range of frequencies , but they have much smaller dispersion at the vicinity of the inversion stability curve and we will restrict often our study to them .",
    "static breathers in the above mentioned region have an energy between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62k . the dipolar energy of these breathers oscillates between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the energy depends monotonically with the frequency , corresponding the highest energy to the smallest frequency .",
    "moving breathers behave as quasiparticles , having an effective mass @xmath65 related with the kinetic energy of the breather by @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the translational velocity of the breather  @xcite .",
    "@xmath68 is also the kinetic energy added to the static breather .",
    "@xmath65 is approximately constant as long as @xmath67 is small enough and , therefore , emits small phonon radiation .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows the dependence of the mass with respect to the frequency for three different values of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , mbs have an effective mass @xmath65 between 30 and 46  amu , depending on the value of frecuency and the stacking parameter .",
    "in order to study the effect of the curvature on breather mobility , we launch a breather through the bending point .",
    "the bending acts as a potential barrier  @xcite in accordance to the trapping hypothesis formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a discussion of this last point see ref .",
    "it implies that breathers are reflected when reaching the bending point as long as their translational energy @xmath69 is below a critical point @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig : kappaen ] shows the dependence of this value with respect to @xmath39 for several frequencies .",
    "the dependence of the critical initial velocity is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : kappavel ] .",
    "@xmath42 , which is also the amount of energy given to a static breather to start its movement , is fairly small compared to the thermal energy at physiological temperature of  0.027  ev .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that it can be given easily by the environment , and most mbs are able to pass through bending points without being reflected .",
    "in this paper we consider a model for dna with long  range interaction due to the dipole moments of the hydrogen bonds among nucleotides .",
    "the dipole parameter @xmath24 has been obtained through quantum chemical calculations including the whole nucleoside .",
    "the consequences for moving breathers in straight and bent dna chains have been analyzed .",
    "these can be summarize as : 1 ) for each different value of the stacking parameter there exist mbs with different frequencies , including an upper limit , determined numerically for the inversion of stability curve , and a lower limit determined both numerically and analytically by the top of the phonon band .",
    "2 ) mbs breather have a fairly large effective mass of 3050  amu .",
    "2 ) the values of @xmath24 , though small , are large enough for the mbs to feel the the bending of dna .",
    "3 ) we have calculated the minimum kinetic energy and the velocity of a breather to be able to pass over a bending point in function of the curvature . as the minimum kinetic energy is small , it seems plausible that most mbs will have enough energy to pass through bending points , although the ones with low energy will be reflected .",
