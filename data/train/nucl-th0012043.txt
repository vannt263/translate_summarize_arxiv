    "parity violation continues to be a focus of the nuclear physics community .",
    "it is being used both to uncover the structure of the nucleon in electron - scattering experiments such as sample@xcite , and to determine parity - violating ( pv ) but flavour - conserving couplings between pions and nucleons@xcite . while the pv interaction between leptons and nucleons is well understood , the purely hadronic pv sector is presently somewhat confused .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that measurements of pv observables in the single nucleon sector would significantly improve this situation  @xcite    the conventional description of nuclear parity - violation is formulated in terms of a pv potential generated through single - meson exchange ( sme ) , such as the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements of parity - violation in light nuclei@xcite do not yet indicate that the sme picture is consistent .",
    "in addition , in the framework of sme , the data from @xmath4 suggest that the @xmath5 pion - nucleon weak coupling constant , @xmath6 , is much smaller than naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) would suggest@xcite .",
    "if , in fact , @xmath6 is much smaller than the nda estimate then weak one - pion - exchange ( ope ) may not provide the dominant long - distance component of the pv potential .",
    "it becomes necessary to include parity - violating two - pion  @xcite and multi - pion interactions consistent with the chiral symmetries of qcd as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in ref .",
    "for very low - energy pv observables , the underlying mechanism generating parity - violation does not need to be known in order to make model - independent relations between different observables .",
    "this approach has been applied to pv in the nn - sector for many years  @xcite and we continue to develop this approach using the pionless effective field theory defined with dibaryon fields  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite . the difference between @xmath7 and the more familiar @xmath8  @xcite is that effective range contributions are summed to all orders with @xmath7  , where @xmath9 is the deuteron binding momentum and @xmath10 is the effective range in the @xmath11 channel . for processes involving the deuteron ,",
    "the convergence is substantially improved by resumming such terms , as the normalization of the deuteron s - state plays a central role .",
    "emperically , it has been found that these terms make the largest contribution at each order in the @xmath8 expansion .",
    "after resumming such terms , the remaining contributions from the nn scattering amplitude involve the shape - parameter @xmath12 and higher order terms in the effective range expansion . ] .",
    "low - energy pv observables such as the deuteron anapole moment and the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath13 , in polarized neutron capture @xmath14 , can be described by an effective field theory ( eft ) involving only nucleons and photons  @xcite .",

    "for both the deuteron anapole moment and @xmath13 we need only consider pv interactions of the @xmath11 channel",
    ". restricting ourselves to @xmath5 parity - violation means that we consider only a @xmath22 coupling , described by a lagrange density of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an unknown weak coupling constant that must be fit to data or predicted from the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "the ellipses denote higher dimension operators involving more powers of the center of mass energy , insertions of the electromagnetic gauge field or isospin breaking effects , each suppressed by inverse powers of the pion mass ( or the appropriate high scale ) .",
    "a similar approach to pv interactions has been recently explored by khriplovich and korkin  @xcite , where they use effective short range interactions to describe the asymmetry in @xmath25 between the photon circular polarization states .",

    "we have retained the formally higher order contribution from the gauge - invariant four - nucleon - one - photon interaction proportional to @xmath44 , that couples the @xmath11 and @xmath19 dibaryons and the magnetic field , described by the lagrange density @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath19 dibaryon .",

    "0.15 in    .2 in    in the zero - momentum transfer limit @xmath56 reduces to @xmath62 consistent with limiting values determined previously  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is clear that there is a model - independent relation between @xmath13 and the non - nucleon contribution to the deuteron anapole moment at leading order in the effective field theory expansion . in the theory with perturbative pions and ksw power - counting  @xcite , both @xmath13  @xcite and the deuteron anapole form factor  @xcite",
    "have been computed at leading order in @xmath6 and this relation is found to exist .",
    "however , we see that it is more general than leading order in @xmath6 .",
    "corrections to this relation arise from not only operators involving insertions of time - derivatives in pv operators but also from insertions of the shape parameter ( and higher nn interactions terms ) and from the anapole moment of the dibaryon itself , @xmath63 this gives a contribution to @xmath54 of @xmath64 suppressed by just one power of @xmath65 in the power - counting .",
    "thus , the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath54 is expected to hold only up to order @xmath65 .",
    "it is appropriate to address some concerns recently expressed about eft calculations of pv processes  @xcite . in ref .",

    "the relative sign between the pv asymmetry @xmath13 arising from weak ope alone and the pv ope nn potential computed in ref .",
    "@xcite agrees with previous calculations , as detailed in ref .",
    "it appears that the overall sign discrepancy is due to convention alone , and so we will detail the interaction terms that were used in determining the sign of the asymmetry .",
    "firstly , the strong interaction lagrange density is @xmath66 where @xmath67 transforms as @xmath68 under @xmath69 chiral transformations .",
    "the @xmath70 field is defined as @xmath71 and under chiral transformations @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the noether current associated with axial transformations which , when compared to the @xmath73-asymmetry in @xmath74 , fixes @xmath75 ( for instance , see refs .",

    "\\cal o}\\left(\\pi^3\\right ) \\ \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , transform as @xmath79 under chiral transformations .",
    "these definitions lead to an opposite sign for the pv pion - exchange potential   sign convention such that the left - handed chirality projector is @xmath80 ( e.g. eq .  ( 29 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and defines the strong coupling @xmath81 through @xmath82 ( eq .",
    "( 113 ) in ref .",
    "this requires that @xmath81 is negative for the pion field we have defined in the text .",

    "this set of sign conventions will only matter when there is a rigorous theoretical prediction for the sign of @xmath6 . at this point in time",
    "no such calculation exists",
    ". a comparison with existing hadronic model estimates will provide information about the validity of such models for nonleptonic matrix elements  @xcite , and we will have to be satisfied with this somewhat primitive level of understanding until a result from lattice - qcd is computed .    in the context of ksw power - counting , where a unified theory of pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions was proposed ,",
    "the estimated @xmath83 in @xmath13 uncertainty reflects not only the presence of higher dimension pion - nucleon parity violating interactions , but higher order contributions to the strong nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "given the present convergence problems  @xcite of ksw power - counting for certain quantities one can not read too much into this uncertainty .",
    "however , it remains true that until a converging expansion for the nn interaction , consistent with chiral symmetry is constructed , it is unrealistic to claim precision predictions for any observables of this type within either the potential model approach  , the pion - exchange current saturates the local counterterm that appears in @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the local counterterm for the deuteron quadrupole moment is _ not _ saturated by pion - exchange currents  @xcite , nor is the local counterterm that contributes at nlo to @xmath84 break up  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is much smaller than nda estimates , such formally higher dimension operators will make an enhanced contribution to electromagnetic observables . ] or using an eft where pions are included as dynamical degrees of freedom . at present , claims such as those of ref .",
    "@xcite are unfounded .",
    "we have shown how to describe the low - energy pv interactions in the two - nucleon sector by local operators in @xmath7 . given the possibility that @xmath6 may be much smaller than nda estimates , it is fruitful to consider the most general structure of the pv interactions .",
    "this attitude has been taken recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the circular polarization asymmetry in @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown that there is a model independent relation between @xmath13 , pv asymmetry in @xmath0 , and @xmath56 , the non - nucleon part of the deuteron anapole moment at leading order in the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "it is important to test this relation if possible but it would require the measurement of @xmath13 , the nucleon anapole moment , and the deuteron anapole moment .",
