    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems in each of them a low - mass companion transfers material via roche - lobe overflow onto a black hole ( bh ) or a weakly magnetized neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "they spend most time in a dim , quiescent state with a x - ray luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , but occasionally they undergo bright x - ray and optical outbursts , which are ascribed to a huge increase of accretion rates . based on their peak x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5 in 210 kev )",
    ", lmxbs can be classified into three subclasses : bright ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath4 ) , faint ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath4 ) , and very faint x - ray transients ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath4 ; wijnand et al .",
    "2006 ) . at present",
    ", it is widely accepted that outbursts of bright x - ray transients arise from the disc thermal - viscous instability ( chen et al .",
    "1997 ) , which also offers promising explanation for other accretion systems , e.g. , dwarf novae and active galactic nuclei .",
    "however , the standard disc instability model ( dim ) is unable to reproduce the observed long recurrence times nor the typical `` fast - rise exponential - decay '' light curves ; moreover , it produces multiple re - flares which have never been observed ( see lasota 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "there have been several attempts to modify the standard dim to account for these observed properties , often by invoking irradiation heating ( king & ritter 1998 ) , low @xmath9-viscosity ( menou et al . 2000 ) , and truncated disc ( dubus et al .",
    "taking both the irradiation and truncation effects into account , dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argued that the outburst decay is divided into three stages .",
    "first , the x - ray irradiation inhibits the disc from returning to the cool state ; the decay is viscous as the thermal equilibrium can be maintained .",
    "the light curve shows a near - exponential decay .",
    "second , the accretion rate becomes low enough that the irradiation is not sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc ; however , the decay rate is still controlled by the irradiation .",
    "the light curves exhibit a linear decay . in the final stage ,",
    "the irradiation plays no role and light curves quickly decay on a thermal time - scale .    to date",
    ", dozens of very faint x - ray transients ( vfxts ) have been discovered ( muno et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of them have exhibited type i x - ray bursts ( cornelisse et al . 2002 ; degenaar & wijnands 2009 ) , and their companions are fainter than b2 iv stars since no optical and infrared counterpart was detected ( muno et al .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these sources are lmxbs , and the unusually low outburst luminosity might imply very low time - averaged mass accretion rates in vfxts . in the dim framework , if the mean mass transfer rates are much larger than @xmath10 yr@xmath4 , the duty cycles of transients will be larger than those observed , i.e. , frequent outbursts are expected for most sources ( maccarone & patruno 2013 ) . however , king & wijnands ( 2006 ) pointed out that the mass of a companion can only lose a mass of @xmath11 within a hubble time if the mean mass transfer rates are less than @xmath12 yr@xmath4 .",
    "that is , the standard lmxbs evolution is too slow for normal stellar - mass companions to reach the very low mass stars ( @xmath13 ) that probably exist in vfxts , posing a challenge to the binary evolution theory ( king & wijnands 2006 ) .",
    "the nature of vfxts is still a puzzle , and our study on vfxts is hampered by several factors . due to their relatively faint radiations ,",
    "the most sensitive x - ray instruments are required to collect good quality spectra and determine their outburst durations .",
    "a large number of vfxts are found close to sgr a@xmath14 owing to xmm - newton / chandra / swift monitoring campaigns in the galactic centre region ( e.g. , wijnands et al .",
    "2006 ; degenaar & wijnands 2009 ) . however , near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) detection is not feasible in the direction of the galactic centre due to the serious absorption .",
    "the outburst durations of vfxts span from days to months ( degenaar & wijnands 2009 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we hardly know",
    "when outbursts are exactly over due to instrumental limitations , and the values of their outburst durations also depend on the instrument sensitivity .",
    "the decay time - scale is a better parameter to describe light curves ; however , it is more difficult to estimate because the stochastic variations and irregular profiles usually presented in the light curves of vfxts . as a result , there is still lack of light curve analysis for vfxts .",
    "the vfxt , swift j1357.2 - 0933 , is located at the position of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( galactic coordinate ) , and was first detected by",
    "_ swift _ on 2011 january 28 during its outburst with a low peak luminosity @xmath17 erg s@xmath4 ( krimm et al . 2011 ) . the short distance ( @xmath18 kpc ; rau et al . 2011 ) and low extinction in its direction ( high galactic latitude ) allow us to obtain a set of nuv data , which had not been available for any vfxt before .",
    "armas padilla et al .",
    "( 2013 ) investigated the correlations between the simultaneous x - ray and nuv luminosities , and argued that its nuv emissions originate from a viscously heated disc instead of the x - ray reprocessing . analyzing its spectroscopic observations , corral - santana et al .",

    "the x - ray and nuv light curves of swift j1357.2 - 0933 during its 2011 outburst exhibited relatively simple exponential decay profiles , which are worth a careful study . in this paper , we firstly estimate some basic parameters ( e.g. , the decay time - scale and the accretion rate ) , then discuss the origin of its nuv emission , and test the dim . the _ swift _ data reduction is described in the next section .",
    "the results and their physical implications are presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "conclusion and discussion follow in section 5 .",
    "_ swift _ is a multi - wavelength observatory with three scientific instruments on board : the burst alert telescope ( _ bat _ ) , the x - ray telescope ( _ xrt _ ) , and the uv / optical telescope ( _ uvot _ ) . swift j1357.2 - 0933 triggered the _ bat _ on 2011 january 28 ( krimm et al .",
    "2011 ) , and then _ swift _ executed 43 pointings in the following 7 months .",
    "we process both the _ xrt _ and the _ uvot _ data with the packages and tools available in heasoft version 6.14 .",
    "the _ xrt _ data were taken in photon - counting ( pc ) mode before february 1 and after may 13 , and the window - timing ( wt ) mode was used between february 1 and may 13 .",
    "the initial event cleaning is performed with the task _ xrtpipeline _ using standard quality cuts . the source light curves are extracted within a circle of radius 25 pixels centreed at the source position with _ xselect _ , while an annulus region with the radius 25 and 50 pixels is adopted for background region . the first observation taken in pc mode",
    "is strongly affected by pileup , and thus excluded in this work .",
    "the light curves are corrected with the task _ xrtlccorr _ accounting for telescope vignetting and point spread function corrections due to the geometry of the light curve extraction region .",
    "the scaled background rate is then subtracted from the corrected light curves .",
    "the net count rates are averaged for each observation , and we also use the spectral fitting results published in armas padilla et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the _ uvot _ has six filters : _ v _ , _ b _ , _ u _ , _ uvw1 _ , _ uvm2 _ and _ uvw2 _ with a coverage of 17006000  .",
    "the _ uvot _",
    "observations were performed in the image mode .",
    "when available , the sky image is summed for each observation with _",
    "uvotimsum _ in order to increase photon statistics .",
    "we perform aperture photometry with the summed images by using _ uvotsource _ with an aperture radius 5 , and the background flux density is extracted from a neighboring source - free sky region .",
    "the nuv flux is calculated by assuming the constant flux density within each filter band , which is read from their response file ( version 105 ) .",
    "we also correct the integral luminosity in _ uvot _ band ( 2.17.8 ev ) for the galactic extinction following the description in armas padilla et al .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the fluxes at all wavelengths decrease monotonically and track each other consistently until below the instrument detection limit after @xmath24 days .",
    "figure 1 also shows that the light curves show near - exponential decay in the early phase .",
    "we fit the light curves ( either count rates or flux ) with the exponential function @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant , @xmath27 is observational date , and @xmath28 is the decay time - scale .",
    "the time - scales monotonically decreases with photon energies ranging over four orders of magnitude ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the e - folding decay time of x - ray is @xmath29 days , while the time - scales of longer - wavelength light curves are @xmath30 days , i.e. , @xmath31 .         for different energy bands.[decay],width=340 ]",
    "extrapolating the solid line in figure 1 , we expect a x - ray luminosity @xmath32 erg s@xmath4 ( in 0.510.0 kev ) on 2011 - 08 - 23 , corresponding to an absorbed flux of @xmath33 erg @xmath34 s@xmath4 ( in 0.210.0 kev ) , which is above the _ xrt _ sensitivity . however , _",
    "did not detect the source in the last two observations , indicating that the light curves transit to a faster - decay at late times .",
    "the transition should happen between the last observation ( 2011 - 07 - 28 ) that agrees with the exponential fitting ( the solid line in figure 1 ) and the first observation ( 2011 - 08 - 23 ) that deviates from the fitting .",
    "the transition luminosity is deduced from the observational time of these two data assuming the exponential decay .",
    "we suggest that the transition occurred at the x - ray luminosity of a few times @xmath35 erg s@xmath4 between 2011 - 07 - 28 and 2011 - 08 - 23 ( red boxes region in figure 1 ) assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc ( rau et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the _ uvot _ data also exist the similar transition .",
    "the integral luminosity in _ uvot _ band ( 2.17.8 ev ) decreases from the peak value of @xmath36 erg s@xmath4 to @xmath37 erg s@xmath4 on 2011 - 05 - 13 , after which time the observations were sparse and only one filter was used for each observation .",
    "the _ uvm2 _ observation on 2011 - 07 - 28 still follows ( at least not significantly deviates from ) the exponential decay , indicating that the transition takes place after 2011 - 07 - 28 .",
    "uvw1 _ observations further suggest that the transition happened between 2011 - 07 - 28 and 2011 - 08 - 18 , that is , the light curves of x - ray and nuv might transit almost simultaneously .",
    "the nuv light curves present relatively shallower decay , and the nuv luminosity within all six filter bands at the onset of transition is estimated to be @xmath38 erg s@xmath4 according to the exponential law .",
    "even though entering into a faster - decay phase after 2011 - 08 - 18 , the source can still be detected by the _",
    "u _ filter on 2011 - 08 - 23 , implying that the decay time - scale is of a few days at late times .    based on the exponential decay scenario ,",
    "we calculate the nuv luminosity ( @xmath39 ) within 2.1 - 7.8 ev and the ratio of @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the ratio increases up to 2 to 3 as outburst declines at the onset of light curve deviation from the exponential decay law . when entering into the late faster - decay stage , the fluxes of the last observations with _ uvw1 _",
    "filter ( 2011 - 08 - 11 ) and _ u _ filter ( 2011 - 08 - 23 ) are lower than those predicted by exponential law by a factor of @xmath41 , putting a lower limit of @xmath42 .",
    "the origins of nuv emissions in xrbs are diverse .",
    "the strong correlation between the x - ray flux and the nuv flux @xmath43 has been revealed in several sources . using the _ swift _ monitoring data of xte j1817330 , rykoff et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed the correlation slope @xmath44 , that is consistent with the value predicted by the x - ray reprocessing model .",
    "in contrast , the small values of @xmath45 observed in the 2011 outburst of swift j1357.2 - 0933 implies that the x - ray irradiation contributes little or no nuv emission ( armas padilla et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this work , we further completely rule out the irradiation hypothesis since the nuv luminosity is close to and even exceeds the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath46 ) at late times . on the other hand ,",
    "the companion is very red and contributes tiny radiations in _ uvot _ band with a @xmath21-magnitude of @xmath47 ( shahbaz et al .",
    "so we confirm that the viscously heated disc is the only option for the nuv emission .    in lmxbs",
    "the inner disc is hot , once the accretion rate is below the critical value , the outer disc becomes too cold ( @xmath48 k ) and somewhere in between the disc must be unstable .",
    "the reason is that in this region the accreted matter is partially ionized , and the hydrogen recombination results in a large change in opacity , affecting the thermal equilibrium .",
    "if the instability propagates in the disc , it would trigger re - flares , which are not present in the data of swift j1357.2 - 0933 .",
    "it was widely believed that the irradiation plays a dominant role in lmxb behaviors , e.g. , keeping the disc ionized and stabilizing it .",
    "menou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that the re - flares can be prevented without the irradiation , if the inner and most unstable part of the accretion disc was replaced by a hot accretion flow and the viscosity parameter was significantly small .",
    "however , their model failed to reproduce several important features of light curves ( figure 8 in their paper ) : 1 ) the output light curves are markedly different from the exponential shape ; 2 ) the decay time - scales ( @xmath49 days ) are too short ; 3 ) in the final stage , the light curves decay steeply on a thermal time - scale .",
    "lasota ( 2001 ) suggested that re - flares were a fundamental property of dim .",
    "the exponential decay profiles without re - flares shown in the outburst of swift j1357.2 - 093313 can not be comprehended in the framework of dim when the irradiation is negligible .",
    "in addition , the decay time - scale of a few days in the late faster - decay stage is much longer than the thermal time - scale .",
    "alternatively , we suggest that the outburst is driven by a stable viscous process , and the whole disc is fully ionized during the _ swift _ observations . assuming that the accretion disc radius @xmath50 and the kinematic viscosity @xmath51 are nearly constant , the surface density is quasi - steady and goes as @xmath52 ( king & ritter 1998 ; frank et al .",
    "the mass of the disc can be given by integrating the surface density : @xmath53 , that is , the accretion rate decays as @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the light curves would naturally draw out exponential profiles if the luminosity scales as @xmath55 .",

    "( 2013 ) suggested that the orbital period of the swift j1357.2 - 093313 is @xmath56 h , a large inclination @xmath57 , and the mass of the black hole exceeds 3 @xmath20 .",
    "the short orbital period points to a small accretion disc , @xmath58 a few times @xmath59 cm , and the unusually low @xmath60 erg s@xmath4 corresponds to @xmath61 eddington luminosity of a @xmath62 black hole .",
    "both theoretical and observational works suggested that @xmath63 increases with orbital periods ( e.g. , king 2000 ; wu et al .",
    "2010 ) . analyzing a large sample of lmxbs , knevitt et al .",
    "( 2014 ) claimed that the @xmath63 of lmxbs with orbital periods of @xmath64 h would be lowered owing to the transition to the radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) .",
    "previous x - ray spectral fitting shows an anti - correlation between the photon index ( @xmath65 ) and the x - ray luminosity ( armas padilla et al .",
    "2013 ) , which is also found in some other xrbs ( kalemci et al .",
    "2005 , 2013 ; corbel et al .",
    "wu & gu ( 2008 ) interpreted this relationship as due to the riafs .",
    "it means that the outer standard disc is truncated at a transition radius ( @xmath66 ) by an inner hot accretion flow ( see zhang 2013 ; yuan & narayan 2014 for reviews ) .",
    "qiao & liu ( 2013 ) employed the truncated disc model to study the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath67 in the sub - eddington accretion .",
    "they argued that at accretion rates ( @xmath68 ) lower than @xmath69 eddington accretion rate , the inner disc vanishes completely by evaporation , and the accretion is dominated by inner advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs , narayan & yi 1995 ) , which can produce the anti - correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "nowadays , it is widely believed that the outer thin disc is restricted beyond a large radius @xmath66 , and the radiation is extremely inefficient at low accretion rates ( e.g. , esin et al .",

    "considering the viscous time - scale @xmath92 days , a lower limit for peak accretion rate @xmath93 is deduced from the exponential decay formula .",
    "the observed @xmath60 erg s@xmath4 points to a very low x - ray radiative efficiency @xmath94 , that is much lower than the value predicted from adafs ( @xmath95 for @xmath96 , xie & yuan 2012 ) , indicating that a high proportion of accretion mass is lost in outflows before reaching the central bh .",
    "note that both the radio detection during the outburst analyzed here ( sivakoff et al . 2011 ) and the quiescent optical / infrared observations of this source ( shahbaz et al .",

    "<S> swift j1357.2 - 0933 underwent an episodic accretion in 2011 and provided very regular temporal and spectral evolution , making it an ideal source for exploring the nature of very faint x - ray transients ( vfxts ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present a detailed analysis on both x - ray and near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes at all wavelengths display a near - exponential decays in the early phase and transits to a faster - decay at late times . </S>",
    "<S> the e - folding decay time - scales monotonically decrease with photon energies , and the derived viscous time - scale is @xmath0 days . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scale in the late faster - decay stage is about a few days . </S>",
    "<S> the high ratio of nuv luminosity to x - ray luminosity indicates that the irradiation is unimportant in this outburst , while the near - exponential decay profile and the long decay time - scales conflict with the disc thermal - viscous instability model . </S>",
    "<S> we thus suggest that the disc is thermally stable during the observations . adopting the truncated disc model </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a lower limit of peak accretion rate of @xmath1 and the x - ray radiative efficiency @xmath2 , which decreases as the luminosity declines . </S>",
    "<S> the low x - ray radiative efficiency is caused by the combined action of advection and outflows , and naturally explains that the x - ray reprocessing is overwhelmed by the viscous radiation of the outer standard disc in the nuv regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a possibility that the outer standard disc recedes from the central black hole , resulting in the faster - decay at late times .    </S>",
