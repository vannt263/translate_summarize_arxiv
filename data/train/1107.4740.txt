    "the investigation of qcd phase diagram is fundamental to our understanding of strong interactions . at vanishing baryon chemical potential ,",
    "lattice qcd calculations predict the occurrence of a cross - over from hadronic phase to the quark - gluon plasma phase above a critical temperature of about 170 - 190 mev @xcite .",
    "a distinct singular feature of the phase diagram is the qcd critical point @xcite which is located at the end of the transition boundary .",
    "a characteristic feature of the critical point is the divergence of the correlation length @xmath0 and extremely large critical fluctuations . in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , however , because of finite size and rapid expansion of the system , those divergence may be washed out . as estimated in @xcite ,",
    "the critical correlation length in heavy ion collisions is not divergent but about 2 - 3 fm .",
    "remnants of those critical large fluctuations may become accessible in heavy ion collisions through an event - by - event analysis of fluctuations in various channels of conservative hadron quantum numbers , for example , baryon number , electric charge , and strangeness @xcite . in an energy scan",
    "there would be a non - monotonic behavior of non - gaussian multiplicity fluctuations , which would be a clear signature for the existence of a critical point .",
    "in fact , at vanishing chemical potential it has been shown that moments of conservative charge fluctuations are sensitive indicators for the occurrence of a transition from hadronic to partonic matter @xcite .",
    "recently , the higher order moments of net - baryon distributions in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies have aroused great interest both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "experimentally , neutrons can not be detected easily and the reconstruction efficiency is very low for strange hadrons .",
    "fortunately , theoretical calculations confirmed that the net - proton distribution can be a meaningful observable for the purpose of detecting the critical fluctuations of net baryons in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest on these higher order moments comes from the discovery of the relation between the moments and the thermal fluctuations near the critical points .",
    "it is shown that the higher order moments have stronger dependence on the correlation length @xmath0 and are therefore more sensitive to the critical fluctuations .",
    "if some memory of large correlation length persists in the thermal medium in hadronization process , this must be reflected in higher order moments of the distributions .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite that the third moment , called skewness , is proportional to @xmath1 and fourth moment , or kurtosis , proportional to @xmath2 while the second moment proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "more importantly , the moments are closely related to the susceptibilities of the thermal medium .",
    "it has been argued that information of qcd phase diagram and the critical point can be obtained from the energy dependence of those moments @xcite .",
    "the moments of net - proton distributions are studied with different theoretical models such as ampt and urqmd @xcite , hijing @xcite , and hadron resonance gas model @xcite etc .",
    "all those theoretical models are quite complicated and many microscopic processes are involved , and as a result many parameters can be tuned in the investigations . therefore , the underlying physics behind the experimental results on the higher order moments of the net - proton distribution is not very transparent from the model studies .",
    "in addition , those studies focused on the moments only and made no direct comparison with the experimentally obtained distributions .    in this paper , we will investigate the net - proton distributions in au+au collisions at @xmath4 from very simple physics considerations : baryon stopping and baryon pair production .",
    "these physics effects are well known from studying heavy ion collisions in the past decades .",
    "we will show that such simple physics can be used to reproduce the experimentally observed net - proton distributions at different colliding centralities with parameters chosen properly .",
    "then higher moments can be calculated numerically from the distributions . in this way the centrality dependence of those moments can be predicted .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we will address the physics points in our considerations for an emission source .",
    "analytical expressions for the net - proton distribution will be given .",
    "the model will be used to fit the experimental data on the distribution .",
    "the model can fit the data nearly perfectly .",
    "the centrality dependence of the moments will then be predicted .",
    "also the moments at lhc energies are discussed .",
    "the last section will be for a brief summary .",
    "it was well established that the net - baryon number would be zero in heavy ion collisions in central rapidity region if there were no nuclear stopping in the processes . because the nuclear stopping effect depends on the collision energy and the size of the system , the baryon number stopped in a rapidity region",
    "is closely related to the number of participant nucleons @xmath5 . in more central collisions",
    "the net baryon number will be larger .",
    "we consider a case in which all final state baryons are assumed being produced from one emission source .",
    "the initial mean nucleon number in the source is denoted as @xmath6 which may be different for different colliding centralities .",
    "considering the randomness and independence of the nucleon - nucleon collisions in a heavy ion collision , the probability of finding @xmath7 baryons stopped in the kinematic region under investigation can be assumed , with the given mean number @xmath6 , as @xmath8 out of those @xmath7 stopped nucleons , some of them are proton , others neutrons .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath9 protons from @xmath7 nucleons is @xmath10 with @xmath11 the fraction of proton in the nucleus .",
    "the above formulas determine the distribution of net proton number in the source in the initial state of the collisions",
    ".    then one can consider the baryon production in the collisions .",
    "baryons can be produced from various channels .",
    "the baryon number is a conserved observable , thus baryons must be produced in baryon - antibaryon pairs .",
    "the pair production may be independent , and as a result of the independence , the probability for producing @xmath12 baryon pairs must be a poissonian with the given mean number of produced pairs @xmath13 as a parameter @xmath14 the parameter @xmath13 depends on the colliding centrality . for more central collisions , the colliding system is larger , therefore @xmath13 should be larger , and more nucleon - antinucleon pairs can be produced in the process .",
    "it is the right place to compare the number distributions used in this paper and in others .",
    "we use a poisson distribution for the baryon pair distribution , supposing the independent production of the pairs . in @xcite the distributions for both proton and anti - proton are assumed poissonian , implying that protons and anti - protons are produced completely independently . therefore the baryon number conservation may be violated in any event . in @xcite ,",
    "a canonical ensemble is employed to derive the number distribution for @xmath15 systems .",
    "this is reasonable because there are a lot of @xmath15 particles in the final state of heavy ion collisions . but a simple transportation of the method to the case for baryon production may be problematic , because the relevant baryon particle number may be not large enough for an equilibrium statistical description .    in the strong production of nucleon - antinucleon pairs ,",
    "isospin is conserved .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 protons , @xmath17 anti - protons , @xmath18 neutrons and @xmath19 anti - neutrons are produced in the process , the conservation of isospin reads @xmath20 if the effect from the presence of mesons is neglected .",
    "thus we have @xmath21 .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath16 protons can be assumed as @xmath22 in writing this equality , we assume that all the produced pairs are within the kinematic range detected experimentally .",
    "of course , this is a rather rough approximation .",
    "in fact , some of the produced nucleons can go out of that range and can not be included in measuring the net - protons in the event .",
    "the effect from limited kinematical acceptance can be taken into account by introducing one more parameter for the probability of the produced baryon in the detected region . to avoid this complexity , in this paper",
    ", such an effect is effectively treated as having the number of pairs @xmath12 a little smaller in the event .",
    "therefore , the value of the parameter @xmath13 obtained from the fitting in this paper should be a little bit smaller than the real one . in the same way ,",
    "the probability of finding @xmath17 anti - proton is @xmath23 .",
    "then the distribution of net - proton @xmath24 from an emission source can be expressed as @xmath25 by inserting an identity expression @xmath26 , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath27 as can be seen from the above expression , the net - baryon distribution depends on two combined parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath13 instead of @xmath29 and @xmath13 separately .",
    "one can check easily that @xmath28 is the mean value of the distribution @xmath30 .",
    "the expression eq . ( [ eq_sin ] ) enables us to compare the calculated net - proton distributions from an emission source to the experimental data from star @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the parameters used are tabulated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the parameters show the expected behaviors from central to peripheral collisions . as one can see from the figure , the agreement with the data is very good over five orders of magnitude .",
    "almost all calculated points for @xmath31 lie within the experimental error bars .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .fitted parameters for fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to make predictions for the net - proton distributions at other centralities , one can parameterize the values of parameters @xmath13 and @xmath28 tabulated in table [ tab1 ] by polynomials of the number of participants @xmath9 as @xmath32 from this parameterization , one can calculate the moments for the distributions easily .",
    "the obtained moments are shown , as functions of the number of participants @xmath5 , in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig6 ] .",
    "the corresponding experimental data from @xcite are shown in the figures for comparison .",
    "the calculated mean , variance , skewness and kurtosis are well in agreement with the data .",
    "the good agreement shows that the basic merits for the baryon production mechanism have been exhibited in our model consideration .                    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed moments are related to the ones from one emission source by using the central limit theorem . this expectation is deduced from the independent emission of particles from each source .",
    "in fact , if the baryons are produced from @xmath33 identical sources , one can get relations of the moments for the measured distributions and those for the emission sources as @xmath34 where quantities with subscript @xmath35 are for moments from one emission source . from the above expressions on centrality dependence",
    ", one can expect constant @xmath36 and @xmath37 for all @xmath5 . in our fitting with a single emission source ,",
    "both @xmath13 changes strongly with centrality . as a result of the centrality dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the centrality dependence of the moments are well reproduced , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig6 ] .",
    "one can also calculate moment products @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the centrality dependence of the products are shown in fig .",
    "[ prod ] . in the @xmath5 range shown , @xmath36 increases a few percent , while @xmath37 is almost exactly 1 , as expected from the hadron resonance gas model @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath37 , for the net - proton distributions from multiple emission sources as functions of @xmath5 .",
    "the dotted line is for @xmath38 expected from the hadron resonance gas model.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    with the good agreement with star data at rhic energy at hand , one can go one step further to predict the higher order moments of the net - proton distributions at lhc energies . for specific ,",
    "let the center - of - mass energy of the colliding nucleon - nucleon pair be 2.76tev . from fitting data in @xcite",
    "one can find the center - of - mass energy dependence of the parameter @xmath28 and extrapolate to lhc / alice energy . in this way",
    ", one gets @xmath39 at @xmath40 tev . to get the parameter @xmath13 at lhc / alice , one can write @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the effective emission temperature of the sources and @xmath43 the mass of proton . in @xcite the effective temperature of the medium",
    "is given as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath44 as @xmath45\\ ] ] with @xmath46 mev . at lhc ,",
    "the center of mass energy is much higher than at rhic , so the value of parameter @xmath13 is much smaller than obtained in the above .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath13 will allow more baryon pairs to be produced from a source .",
    "the predicted moments are shown in fig .",
    "now the mean value of the distribution is zero .",
    "because of zero mean value , the net - proton distribution at lhc / alice is symmetric about 0 and one gets zero value for the skewness .",
    "since the kurtosis is zero for gaussian distributions , extremely small @xmath47 value at large @xmath5 at lhc energies means that the net - proton distributions at lhc energies can be well parameterized by gaussian , but not for small @xmath5 .",
    "the higher order moments of the net - proton distributions in relativistic au+au collisions at @xmath4 are studied from a simple model with effects from initial baryon stopping and final baryon pair emission taken into account .",
    "we have demonstrated that by employing a single emission source model , the distributions at different collision centralities can be well reproduced .",
    "then the higher order moments for the distributions can be calculated without new free parameters .",
    "the calculated moments agree well with the experimental results .",
    "the predicted moments for lhc pb+pb collisions need to be verified experimentally .",
    "it should be mentioned that nothing else is assumed in this model except an initial net - proton and a finite probability for producing baryon pairs from sources .",
    "therefore , our model has nothing to do with thermal equilibrium and/or critical fluctuations .",
    "because our model consideration is based on normal physics effects , our results can be used as a baseline for detecting novel physics in the processes .",
