    "for example , @xmath50-dimensional massive gravity theories admit , generally , up to six propagating modes where five of them are physical and one may be a ghost . depending on the reference metric , the number of degrees of freedom that can be propagated , hence the existence of ghost may vary .",

    "this is a degenerate metric which is equivalent to a theory of massive gravity with stuckelberg fields in the unitary gauge @xcite .",
    "the reason for such consideration is the fact that under a specific coordinate transformation the spatial mass term breaks in spatial dimensions while the general covariance is preserved in radial and temporal coordinates . since this choice of the reference metric leads to preservation of the hamiltonian constraint , one of the degrees of freedoms is removed .",
