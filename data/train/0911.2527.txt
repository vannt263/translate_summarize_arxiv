    "the enumeration of polyominoes is a topic of great interest to chemists , physicists and combinatorialists alike @xcite . in chemical terms",
    ", any polyomino ( with hexagonal cells and with no internal holes ) is a possible benzenoid hydrocarbon . in combinatorics , polyominoes are of interest in their own right because several polyomino models have mathematically appealing exact solutions .",
    "furthermore , they are also relevant to various problems of tilings @xcite .",
    "polyominoes are extensively studied , in one form or another , in a wide variety of problems of interest to physicists .",
    "in particular , we note their investigation under the name _ lattice animals _ , in the study of percolation @xcite , in the graphical representation of the ising model , and its extension to the potts model , and in the study of the properties of branched polymers @xcite .",
    "they are also a representative of a class of problems that appear to be unsolvable  notably the enumeration , by area or perimeter , of self - avoiding polygons , polyominoes and other classes of graphs that are relevant to the ising model and to percolation .",
    "the principal line of attack on such problems is to simplify them until they are solvable , in the hope that the essential physics is not destroyed in the process . that is the approach taken in this chapter , where the model proposed , while still solvable , is closer to the ultimate problem of full polyomino enumeration than has previously been attained .",
    "further , by use of bousquet - mlou s @xcite and svrtan s  @xcite upgraded version of the temperley methodology @xcite , we give the solution of one problem previously out of reach due to its complexity . this development may spur further advances in this class of problem .",
    "one frequently cited polyomino model is that of column - convex polygons  .",
    "there exist two main versions of column - convex polygons : the first composed of square cells and the second of hexagonal cells .",
    "both versions have a rational area generating function . for the version with square cells ,",
    "the area generating function was found independently by plya @xcite in 1938 _ or _ 1969 and by temperley @xcite in 1956 .",
    "that was perhaps the earliest major result in polyomino enumeration .",
    "for the version with hexagonal cells , the area generating function was found by klarner in 1967 @xcite .",
    "the growth constant of square - celled column - convex polygons is @xmath2 , while the growth constant of hexagonal - celled column - convex polygons is @xmath3 .",
    "( by the growth constant we mean the limit @xmath4{a_n}$ ] , where @xmath5 denotes the number of @xmath6-celled elements in a given set of polyominoes . ) in both cases the area generating function is a simple pole , so that @xmath7    there exist some models which are supersets of column - convex polygons and are still solvable .",
    "those models are called @xmath8__-convex polygons _ _",
    "@xcite , _ prudent polygons _",
    "@xcite , _ cheesy polyominoes _",
    "@xcite , _ polyominoes with cheesy blocks _",
    "@xcite , _ column - subconvex polyominoes _",
    "@xcite , and _ simple-2-column polyominoes _",
    "the former two models can be enumerated by perimeter and area , whereas the latter four models have been enumerated only by area .",
    "this chapter is a kind of companion to @xcite .",
    "namely , the enumeration of simple-2-column polyominoes by area was first done in @xcite . in the present chapter ,",
    "we again enumerate simple-2-column polyominoes by area , but this time the cells are hexagons , whereas in @xcite the cells were squares .",
    "as mentioned above , we make use of bousquet - mlou s @xcite and svrtan s  @xcite upgraded version of temperley s methodology @xcite .",
    "the computations are rather long and intricate .",
    "also , these computations are very similar to those which are done detailedly in @xcite .",
    "therefore in this chapter we only give an outline of the proof , though with enough detail that the method may be applied by others to new problems .",
    "incidentally , in @xcite , simple-2-column polyominoes are called by their original name ( coined by s. fereti ) : _ simplex - duplex polyominoes_. the name simple-2-column polyominoes was suggested subsequently ( during the preparation of @xcite ) by tony guttmann .    in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the chemical relevance of polyominoes with hexagonal cells . in section 3 , we define the model . in section 4",
    "we give the formula for @xmath9 , a generating function for simple-2-column polyominoes , in which the variable @xmath10 is conjugate to the area and @xmath11 is conjugate to the number of two - component columns of the polyomino .",
    "a truncated version of the proof is given in section 5 . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath9 , and give a tight lower bound on the growth constant , as well as a very accurate estimate . in section 7 we conclude , outlining further work prompted by our results .    note that our solution essentially gives detailed information only about the area generating function .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath11 counts columns of a certain type .",
    "thus we can not give perimeter - area phase diagrams which are relevant to the description of vesicle collapse .",
    "indeed , as is shown in @xcite , the perimeter generating function has zero radius of convergence ( as is the usual case for polyominoes ) , which precludes such a phase diagram in its usual form .",
    "polyominoes with hexagonal cells can be used to model benzenoid hydrocarbons .",
    "benzenoid hydrocarbons are a class of versatile conjugated organic molecules that have constantly been studied by a variety of researchers .",
    "this is so because benzenoid hydrocarbons found uses in experimental and theoretical research in chemistry @xcite , environmental chemistry @xcite , chemical technology @xcite , cancer research @xcite , ecology @xcite , combinatorial chemistry @xcite , graph theory @xcite , theory of aromaticity @xcite , computational chemistry @xcite , polymer science @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_    additionally , polyominoes and benzenoid structures under various disguises have been discussed regularly at the dubrovnik math / chem / comp symposia .",
    "for example , this class of structures has been discussed there as fractal benzenoids @xcite , as column - convex animals @xcite , in algebraic studies of benzenoids @xcite , in leapfrog transformation @xcite , maximum matchings and eigenvalues of benzenoid graphs @xcite , in phototoxicity @xcite , ring - currents in benzenoid hydrocarbons @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_    apparently research on various aspects of this class of structures continues to date and the present chapter is in this direction .",
    "however , before we proceed , we wish to point to perhaps the first scientific study on hexagonal structures .",
    "this study is due to croatian polymath rugjer bokovi ( 17111787 ) .",
    "he studied the structure of honeycomb .",
    "honeycomb is made of hexagonal cells .",
    "bokovi hypothesized that the hexagonal lattice is not chosen by chance . by using hexagonal lattice ,",
    "bees economize on building material .",
    "bokovi published this study , entitled _ de apium cellulis _ , in 1760 .",
    "there are three regular tilings of the euclidean plane , namely the triangular tiling , the square tiling , and the hexagonal tiling .",
    "we adopt the convention that every square or hexagonal tile has two horizontal edges . in a regular tiling , a tile is often referred to as a _",
    "cell_. a plane figure @xmath12 is a _ polyomino",
    "_ if @xmath12 is a union of finitely many cells and the interior of @xmath12 is connected .",
    "observe that , if a union of _ hexagonal _ cells is connected , then it possesses a connected interior as well , as a connected union of hexagonal tiles must be connected through shared edges .",
    "topologically , a connected union of square cells may be connected only at a shared vertex .",
    "such unions are forbidden by the definition of polyominoes however .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two polyominoes .",
    "we consider @xmath12 and @xmath13 to be equal if and only if there exists a translation @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .    from now on , we concentrate on the hexagonal tiling . when we write `` a polyomino '' , we actually mean `` a hexagonal - celled polyomino '' .",
    "given a polyomino @xmath12 , it is useful to partition the cells of @xmath12 according to their horizontal projection .",
    "each block of that partition is a _ column _ of @xmath12 .",
    "note that a column of a polyomino is not necessarily a connected set . on the other hand",
    ", it may happen that every column of a polyomino @xmath12 is a connected set . in this case",
    ", the polyomino @xmath12 is a _ column - convex polygon_. see figure 1 .        by a _",
    "2-column polyomino _ , we mean a polyomino in which columns with three or more connected components are not allowed .",
    "thus , each column of a 2-column polyomino has either one or two connected components .",
    "simple-2-column polyomino _ is such a 2-column polyomino in which consecutive two - component columns are not allowed .",
    "if @xmath16 is a column of a simple-2-column polyomino , and @xmath16 is a ( left or right ) neighbour of a two - component column , then @xmath16 must be a one - component column .",

    "one reason for doing this is that the growth factor @xmath28 is expected to be greater than that for simple-2-column polyominoes , and may set the benchmark in this regard . at present",

    "<S> column - convex polygons were first counted by area several decades ago , and the result was found to be a simple , rational , generating function . in this chapter we generalize that result . let a @xmath0-column polyomino be a polyomino whose columns can have @xmath1 connected components </S>",
    "<S> . then column - convex polygons are equivalent to 1-convex polyominoes . </S>",
    "<S> the area generating function of even the simplest generalization , namely to 2-column polyominoes , is unlikely to be solvable . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore define a class of polyominoes which interpolates between column - convex polygons and 2-column polyominoes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the area generating function of that class , using an extension of an existing algorithm . the growth constant of the new class is greater than the growth constant of column - convex polyominoes . </S>",
    "<S> a rather tight lower bound on the growth constant complements a compelling numerical analysis . </S>"
