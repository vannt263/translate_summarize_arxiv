    "the thermodynamic limit is performed at the beginning , which brings the model to a free fermion problem .",
    "while in the a - cycle problem , if we consider a perfect periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) for the original spin model , we get a constraint fermion problem and have to keep an arbitray @xmath0 during the calculation .",

    "the theoretical properties of the model ( [ h1 ] ) have been related to real materials since decades ago @xcite .",
    "researchers have also been looking for nowadays state - of - art techniques , such as the ones based on laser - cooled and trapped atomic ions , to mimic this model @xcite .",
    "but these artificial systems can only produce finite lattices in principle , through which we hope to see the trend for large enough systems .",
    "the system with perfect pbc can be realized through a ring geometric optical lattices @xcite , which demands a thorough comprehension of the a - cycle problem . to the best of our knowledge",

    "very few frustrated models can be solved exactly @xcite . to seek for nontrivial phenomenon",
    ", we mainly focus on the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath9 ) system with pbc and large enough @xmath10 , because it suffers a _ ring frustration _ @xcite as a result of antiferromagnetic seam @xcite ( please see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "notice the ring frustration here is not a short range type of the usual case .",
    "one may ask whether the odevity of @xmath0 plays a meaningful character in the a - cycle problem when @xmath1 .",
    "the answer is affirmative . by the rigorous solution",
    ", we demonstrate that the combination of the a - cycle problem and ring frustration does result in a dramatical consequence .",
    "to understand the fascinating result in a contrastive manner , we also discuss the system without any frustration , i.e. with @xmath11 .",
    "we arrange the contents of this paper as follows . in section [ sec : jw ] , we discuss the details about how the periodic spin problem is turned into a fermionic a - cycle one . in section [ sec : even ] , we dwell on the a - cycle problem without ring frustration ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we develop the method of band structure analysis . in section [ sec : odd ] , we work on the a - cycle problem with ring frustration ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the presence of ring frustration will induce an interesting gapless spectrum above the ground state in the strong antiferromagnetic region .",
    "we provide a perturbative picture for a quick view the formation of gapless spectrum due to ring frustration .",
    "we demonstrate that the ground state exhibits a strong longitudinal spin - spin correlation .",
    "we also give finite - temperature properties of the gapless region , including the density of states ( dos ) and the specific heat . in section [ sec : exp ] , we propose an experimental protocol with special concern of the realization of ring frustration . at last , we give a discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "it is convenient to convert the pauli matrices to the raising and lowering operators , @xmath13 by introducing the jordan - wigner fermions that abide by the non - local relations,@xmath14 the spin model , ( [ h1 ] ) , can be transformed to @xmath15 where the total number of fermions , @xmath16 does not conserve .",

    "the c - cycle problem is defined by neglecting the last term , @xmath19i@xmath20(c_{n}^{\\dag}-c_{n})(c_{1}^{\\dag}+c_{1})$ ] , in @xcite@xmath21(c_{n}^{\\dag}-c_{n})(c_{1}^{\\dag}+c_{1 } ) .",

    "thus the c - cycle problem becomes a free fermion one @xcite .",
    "while for a system with perfect ring geometry , there holds a precise condition on the spins , @xmath22 . with no ends ( or boundaries ) existing , nothing in ( [ h2 ] ) could be neglected .",
    "we have to keep an arbitrary @xmath0 in the calculation .",
    "we hope to get a result containing @xmath0as a variable thus it facilitates us to take the limit , @xmath1 .",

    "one should notice that , although there holds a pbc for the spin operators , a priori pbc should not be imposed on the fermions since an anti - pbc is also a reasonable choice .",
    "we will demonstrate both of them , @xmath27 ( pbc ) and @xmath28 ( anti - pbc ) , are indispensable to restore the full degrees of freedom of the original spin model , ( [ h1 ] ) , exactly .",
    "we will see that the parity , @xmath29 , will be fixed by the boundary condition of the fermions .",
    "let us see the case without ring frustration first . to make the fourier transformation @xmath30 available for solving the fermionic problem",
    ", we found the boundary condition must be bound up with the parity .",
    "so there are two routes to be followed . when @xmath31 , we call it the _ odd channel ( o ) _ and when @xmath32 , the _ even channel ( e ) _ respectively .",
    "the procedure inevitably becomes a little tedious . in the following , we delicately use notations to make the deductions as clear as possible .",
    "for example , we use the notations @xmath33 and @xmath32 , although @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the same thing .    in fact ,",
    "for the case of @xmath12 , schultz _",
    "et al_. @xcite had discussed the contribution of the two channels in context of the classical two - dimensional ising model in the same essence .",
    "but their discussion on the thermal states of the classical two - dimensional ising model only corresponds to the ground state property of the quantum transverse ising model . in this section",
    ", we discuss the quantum model directly and develop a method of band structure analysis for both ground states and excitations .      in the odd channel ( @xmath31 ) , the jordan - wigner fermions must obey pbc : @xmath27 , and the momentum in the first brillouin zone ( @xmath36st bz ) must take a value in the set @xmath37 where the superscript @xmath38 denotes @xmath12 @xmath39 and @xmath31 @xmath40 .",
    "after the fourier transformation , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath41 as@xmath42 where @xmath43 notice there is no need of bogoliubov transformation for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .      in the even channel ( @xmath32 )",

    "its energy reads @xmath52 notice that the fermionic bcs state @xmath49 itself can not be a valid state for the original spin model because of the parity constraint .",
    "likewise , the lowest energy state in the even channel reads @xmath53 where@xmath54 its energy reads@xmath55    if @xmath0 is small , we always have @xmath56 , so @xmath57 is the ground state .    if @xmath1 , @xmath57 is still the ground state for @xmath58 and there is a gap , @xmath59 , to the first excited state @xmath60 . above @xmath60 ,",
    "there is a continuum band of excitations . while for @xmath61 , @xmath57 and @xmath60 become the degenerate ground states and there is a gap , @xmath62 , above them",
    "now , the sum in the ground state energy , ( [ e0(e , e ) ] ) , can be replaced with an integral that can be worked out , so we get @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "( [ e0(e , e)/n ] ) is non - analytic at @xmath65 , because its second derivative in respect of @xmath66 has a logarithmic divergent peak @xmath67 .",
    "so in fact , we have a critical point at @xmath68 .",
    "these conclusions are the same as the ones in previous investigations @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the two states , ( [ state e0(e , o ) ] ) and ( [ state e0(e , e ) ] ) , in the limit @xmath69 correspond to two ghz spin states in @xmath70 representation,@xmath71 respectively .",
    "the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the fermionic problem are @xmath72 for both channels , so we get @xmath73 dof totally , which is redundantly twice of the dof of the original spin model .",
    "however , the odd channel requires an odd parity and the even channel an even parity .",
    "this parity constraint helps us to obliterate the redundant dof in each channel exactly and reconstruct the band structure of the original spin problem .",
    "we can construct all excited energy levels by the bcs functions ( [ bcs - ee ] ) and ( [ bcs - eo ] ) precisely .",
