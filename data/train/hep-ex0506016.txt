    "the properties of the @xmath7 boson have been measured to very high precision at lep@xcite .",
    "naturally one wants to match this precision for the charged carriers of the electroweak interaction . over the next few years",
    "the tevatron is the only accelerator which can produce @xmath2 bosons .",
    "measuring the properties of the @xmath2 boson to a very high precision is an important test of the standard model . from the measured @xmath2 cross section",
    ", one can infer an indirect measurement of the @xmath2 width and lepton universality . since at the tevatron",
    "the @xmath2 bosons are produced through quark anti - quark annihilation , a significant uncertainty for all direct electroweak measurements comes from the knowledge of the parton distributions inside the proton .",
    "the probability of finding a parton carrying a momentum fraction @xmath8 within the incoming proton is expressed in the parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 charge asymmetry provides important input on the ratio of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark components of the pdf and will help to further constrain parton distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath2 boson mass serves as a test of the standard model , but through radiative corrections is also sensitive to hypothetical new particles .",
    "together with a precise measurement of the top quark mass@xcite , the @xmath2 boson mass constrains the mass of the higgs boson , which has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "both cdf and d are multi - purpose detectors .",
    "they consist of tracking systems surrounded by calorimeter and muon identification systems .",
    "cdf s tracking system consists of a wire drift chamber ( the central outer tracker ) and a 7-layer silicon microstrip vertex detector ( svxii ) immersed in a 1.4 t magnetic field . a lead ( iron ) scintillator sampling calorimeter",
    "is used for measuring electromagnetic ( hadronic ) showers .",
    "d employs a silicon microstrip tracker ( smt ) and a central fiber tracker ( cft ) , both located in a 2 t magnetic field .",
    "the sampling calorimeter consists of liquid argon and uranium .",
    "since the hadronic decay of the @xmath2 boson has an extremely large background originating from strongly interacting processes , cdf and d use the clean leptonic decays to study the @xmath2 boson .",
    "the signature is a high energy lepton with large missing transverse momentum originating from the neutrino , which does not interact with the detector .",
    "the momentum balance in the direction of the beam is unconstrained and as a result , the @xmath2 events are studied in the plane transverse to the beam .",
    "a typically used quantity is the transverse mass : @xmath11 which is similar to the invariant mass , just in the two transverse dimensions . if not otherwise stated , we restrict the lepton identification to the well instrumented central region of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath7 boson events are identified by two high energy leptons .",
    "these events have very low background .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath7 bosons are identified by their leptonic decays to electrons , muons and taus , from which the total rates @xmath14br(@xmath15 ) and @xmath14br(@xmath16 ) are obtained .",
    "the cross section times branching ratio is calculated as follows : @xmath17 the @xmath2 and @xmath7 boson cross sections have been measured by cdf@xcite with different datasets in different sub - detectors .",
    "figure [ wzx ]    shows a summary of the cdf and d cross section measurements in all leptonic decay modes .",
    "all measurements show good agreement with nnlo calculations@xcite , represented by the vertical band .",
    "lepton universality in @xmath2 decays can be tested by extracting the ratio of the electroweak couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the measured ratio of @xmath15 cross sections .",
    "the @xmath15 couplings are related to the measured production cross section ratio @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 in this ratio , important systematic uncertainties cancel .",
    "the results obtained are@xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 where the largest systematic uncertainty comes from event selection efficiencies .",
    "since these efficiencies are measured using the @xmath16 sample , the uncertainty will decrease as more @xmath7 bosons are collected .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 of the cross section measurements for @xmath2 and @xmath7 bosons can be used to extract the total width of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "@xmath24 can be expressed as : @xmath25 using the very precise measurement of @xmath26/@xmath27 from lep and nnlo calculations of @xmath28 , together with the standard model prediction of @xmath29 one can extract @xmath30 from equation [ indwidth ] .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ summary of indirect @xmath2 width measurements . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ syst ]    for comparison the uncertainties from the previous collider run@xcite ( run 1b ) are also included .",
    "the overall uncertainty is 76 mev .",
    "the @xmath2 boson mass fit results are currently blinded with a constant offset .",
    "the offset will be removed when further cross checks have been completed .",
    "the @xmath2 boson physics program at the tevatron is very successful .",
    "cdf and d have measured the inclusive @xmath2 and @xmath7 cross sections in all three leptonic decay channels , which show good agreement with nnlo calculations . from the cross section measurements , cdf has extracted competitive measurements on lepton universality and an indirect measurement of the @xmath2 boson width .",
    "d has measured the @xmath2 boson width directly in the electron channel with an uncertainty smaller than the run 1 value .",
    "the new cdf @xmath2 charge asymmetry will help to further constrain the uncertainties of parton distribution functions , which affect all the aforementioned measurements . with the addition of 600 pb@xmath1 of data on tape",
    ", these measurements will further constrain the standard model .",
    "cdf has determined the uncertainty on the @xmath2 boson mass with the first @xmath0200 pb@xmath1 of run 2 data to be 76 mev , which is lower than its run 1 uncertainty of 79 mev . with the additional data to come ,",
