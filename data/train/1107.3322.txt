    "the matter and fields , inflowing into a rotating or charged black hole , generate the drastic singular phenomena at the inner cauchy horizon : the infinite blue - shift and mass inflation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . we describe here a back reaction of the stationary spherical accretion flow and reveal the divergence of back reaction perturbations at both the event horizon and the inner cauchy horizon of the nearly extreme charged black hole .",
    "this singular behavior of back reaction perturbations implies the violation of test fluid approximation for the stationary spherical accretion onto extreme black holes .    the stationary accretion onto black hole is a solution with an independent of time @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 influx of test fluid ( or some field ) with the energy density @xmath2 and pressure @xmath3 far from the black hole .",
    "we describe below the corrections to the background spherically symmetric metric of the black hole due to the back reaction of stationary accreting perfect fluid .",
    "the problem of a stationary accretion onto black hole is self - consistent , if ( i ) the accreting fluid is lightweight , and ( ii ) the rate of black hole mass growth is slow ( the stationary limit ) .",
    "two small parameters are needed to satisfy these conditions .",
    "the first small parameter is a mass ratio of the inflowing gas in the volume with the black hole gravitational radius , @xmath4 , to the black hole mass @xmath5 : @xmath6 . with this small parameter ,",
    "the test fluid approximation in the background metric is valid inside the region @xmath7 around the black hole .",
    "the second small parameter is a slowness of the black hole mass changing with respect to the hydrodynamical time , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the sound velocity in the accreting gas .",
    "for example , the stationary spherical accretion rate of the perfect fluid is @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a numerical constant , depending on the equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "this constant @xmath11 is of the order of unity for relativistic fluids with @xmath13 ( i.e , for fluids with a relativistic sound velocity @xmath14 ) .",
    "two small parameters become identical , @xmath15 , for the relativistic perfect fluids . the back reaction of fluid on the background black hole metric in the considered stationary accretion limit",
    "may be found by perturbation method due to existence of these two small parameters .",
    "note that in the stationary accretion limit the apparent horizon will coincide with the event horizon of the accreting black hole .",
    "quite the different approaches were used in @xcite for analysis of the back reaction on the reissner - nordstrm black hole .    below we describe the back reaction of the stationary accretion with a linear accuracy with respect to the small parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we find analytically the corresponding back reaction corrections to the black hole metric metric near the event horizon and near the inner cauchy horizon .",
    "a spherically symmetric metric may be written in the general form with two arbitrary functions @xcite : @xmath17 for application to the back reaction of the accreting matter on the charged black hole , we define two metric functions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and also two corresponding `` mass functions '' ( or mass parameters ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the black hole electric charge . in the case of the reissner - nordstrm metric ( i.e. , in the absence of accreting fluid ) , both mass functions coincide with the black hole mass , @xmath24 , and , respectively , @xmath25 .",
    "a spherically symmetric gravitational field in the general case is defined by the four einstein equations .",
    "three of them are the differential equations of the first - order , and the fourth one is of the second - order .",
    "these equations for metric ( [ spherical ] ) have the following form @xcite : @xmath26 \\\\   & & -\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{2 }   \\left[\\nu''+(\\nu'-\\lambda')\\left(\\frac{\\nu'}{2}+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding components of the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid are @xmath27+\\frac{e^2}{8\\pi r^4 } , \\\\",

    "below it is supposed an arbitrary equation of state @xmath12 , relating the fluid pressure and energy density .",
    "the bianchi identity holds true for einstein equations , and so only three equations from four in ( [ t01])([t22 ] ) are independent .",
    "we choose ( [ g01 ] ) , ( [ g00 ] ) and ( [ g11 ] ) for these independent equations .",
    "zero approximation in our approach corresponds to the stationary spherically symmetric inflow of the test fluid in the background reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "the corresponding solution @xcite defines the conserved radial flux of energy @xmath31 and the radial dependance for the 4-velocity component @xmath32 , for energy density @xmath33 and for pressure @xmath34 . respectively",
    ", this solution fixes all components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 . for self - consistency of the accretion problem in the background metric ,",
    "the radial influx of energy must be small , i.e. @xmath36 .    in the first approximation we will take into account the linear contributions with respect to @xmath36 to the energy momentum - tensor in einstein equations . as a result , we find the deviation of metric from the background one , i.e. the back reaction with a linear accuracy with respect to the small parameter @xmath31 .",
    "it will be shown that the back reaction corrections near the event horizon and inner cauchy horizon of the black hole depend only on the accretion rate @xmath31 and do not depend on the equation of state @xmath12 of the accreting fluid .",
    "formally , to find a back reaction modification of the black hole metric near the horizons , it is needed to consider the space - time region , where both @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "as the first step , we find the back reaction of accretion near the event horizon of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the first einstein equation ( [ g01 ] ) defines the conserved radial flux of anergy , i.e. the matter accretion rate , @xmath39 the value of this flux ( [ perfect ] ) is defined ( in the zero approximation ) from the stationary solution of the test fluid accretion in the background schwarzschild metric @xcite . * * * the radius of the modified event horizon , @xmath40 , in the considered stationary accretion limit is defined by the condition @xmath41 .",
    "the einstein equations are hyperbolic in general , and so we have at the horizon the second condition , @xmath42 . *",
    "* *    the first einstein equation ( [ g01 ] ) in the linear approximation with respect to @xmath43 has a very simple form .",

    "after substitution of this `` factorization '' ansatz in ( [ accretionflux2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath51 the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "is already linear with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "so , for the dimensionless function @xmath48 in this equation it is needed to use a zero approximation with respect to @xmath31 , i.e. to put @xmath52 . in result , the partial differential equation ( [ accretionflux2 ] ) for the function @xmath21 reduces to the ordinary differential equation ( [ accretionflux3 ] ) for @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding solution of this reduced equation is @xmath54 here @xmath55 is a black hole mass at some initial moment @xmath56 and @xmath53 is a current value of black hole mass .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath53 is slowly growing due to a slow accretion rate @xmath36 .",
    "this is the only one equation in our analysis , where the temporal dependance of the accretion rate @xmath57 must be taken into account . in all other equations",
    "the accretion rate @xmath57 is only a small constant parameter .    at this step",
    "we may find the function @xmath48 with the help of the second einstein equation ( [ g00 ] ) .",

    "it is important to note that this solution is valid only in the narrow region @xmath73 around the modified event horizon @xmath65 .",
    "the used linear approximation with respect to @xmath31 would be insufficient for calculation of the corresponding mass function at @xmath74 ( inside the filled box in fig .  1 ) .",
    "during integration of equation ( [ flux2 ] ) we retained only the leading term with @xmath38 in the denominator , providing the major contribution to the solution @xmath75 , and neglected all contributions to the solution of the order of @xmath31 .",

    "according to ( [ local]).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    from ( [ murn1 ] )  ( [ horizonrn ] ) it follows directly , that the test fluid approximation _ is violated _ due to the back reaction of the accreted fluid in the extreme black hole limit @xmath102 .",
    "namely , the corresponding corrections to the radius of the black hole event horizon and the inner cauchy horizon diverge at any arbitrarily small accretion rate @xmath31 , if @xmath102 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite and with the third law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite : the extreme state is unattainable in the finite processes or , in other words , it is impossible in practice to transform the black hole into the naked singularity .",
    "a similar conclusion was derived recently in @xcite by demonstration that the reissner - nordstrm black hole can never be overcharged to the naked singularity via the absorption of a charged particle .",
    "note , that the test fluid approximation is violated for the stationary accretion of ultra - hard fluid with @xmath103 at the event horizon of the extreme kerr - newman black hole even without the back reaction corrections @xcite .",

    "a physical reason for the divergence of back reaction corrections in the extreme case is in the infinite stretching of a local distance @xmath104 to the event horizon @xmath105 ( and , analogously , to the cauchy horizon @xmath106 ) at @xmath107 : @xmath108 .",

    "quite a similar infinite stretching of @xmath104 is also a characteristic feature of the extreme kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "therefore , the described violation of the test fluid approximation for the stationary accretion might be crucial both for the extremely charged and extremely rotating black holes ."
