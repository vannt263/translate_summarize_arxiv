    "thus , @xmath290 is bad .",
    "if @xmath290 was big , it would contain a very good end in its neighborhood ; just as in the proof of theorem  [ t7 ] , we can not locate the root of @xmath26 properly , which gives a contradiction .    therefore , @xmath290 is a bad , small @xmath146-end , and we may apply to @xmath290 the same line of arguments that we applied before to @xmath47 : @xmath403 consists of three vertices @xmath404 , where @xmath405 is a good , small @xmath304-@xmath146-end , and @xmath304 consists of @xmath406 and a vertex @xmath407 from @xmath408 , where , moreover , @xmath409 and @xmath410 are from @xmath383 and not @xmath4-contractible , and @xmath411 is from @xmath383 and @xmath4-contractible .    since @xmath395 is the only @xmath4-contractible edge , we see that @xmath412 , which implies @xmath413 and @xmath414 .",
    "again the situation is symmetric in @xmath415 and @xmath416 , and we may proceed almost literally as in the proof of theorem  [ t7 ] by showing first that @xmath339 , @xmath417 , and @xmath418 $ ] is a subtree of @xmath26 , and thus , more precisely , a path @xmath419 . by symmetry , we may assume that @xmath420 , and , as @xmath398 can not be on the @xmath355-path in @xmath26 , that @xmath351 must be on the @xmath421-path in @xmath26 and hence in @xmath422 .",
    "different from the more general argument , we now have two options for @xmath351 : @xmath351 is either @xmath423 , or it is @xmath313 .",
    "we consider the corresponding cases separately :          if there are no further vertices but @xmath429 and they are all distinct , then @xmath430 . as certified by the @xmath74-end @xmath431 and the edge @xmath432",
    ", @xmath433 is an @xmath146-end contained in @xmath298 .",
    "as we have seen above ( for the arbitrarily chosen @xmath290 ) , the neighborhood of such a fragment necessarily contains @xmath434 , contradiction .",
    "if there are further vertices other than those listed in the previous paragraph , they are all from @xmath426 . then @xmath427 has all its neighbors in @xmath435 .",
    "therefore , @xmath436 , and @xmath427 is , indeed , an @xmath40-fragment , and @xmath437 . since @xmath438 has only one neighbor in @xmath439 , @xmath440 is an @xmath441-fragment ( with @xmath442 ) .",
    "the @xmath74-end @xmath431 together with the edge @xmath432 certifies that @xmath44 is an @xmath146-fragment , and , thus , contains an @xmath146-end @xmath443 , which is in @xmath298 .",
    "however , the neighborhood of @xmath443 does not contain @xmath434 , as it should , by what we have proven about the arbitrarily chosen @xmath290 above , which gives a contradiction .",
    "therefore , there are no further vertices but @xmath429 , and the vertices listed are not all distinct .",
    "this implies @xmath444 .",
    "the neighborhoods of @xmath445 are determined , so that @xmath446 is determined up to a possible edge connecting @xmath35 and @xmath313 .",
    "if @xmath35 and @xmath313 are not adjacent , we get the prism , and otherwise we get the prism plus a single edge .",
