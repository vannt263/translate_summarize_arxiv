    "photon - photon and photon - hadron interactions can also be studied in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "this may be surprising since in general such collisions are dominated by strong interactions between the hadrons .",
    "however , by choosing collisions with large impact parameter b ( or , equivalently , small momentum transfer ) one can suppress these strong interactions",
    ".    the time - dependent electromagnetic field of a fast moving charged particle can be thought of as a spectrum of ( quasireal , or equivalent ) photons  @xcite , see figure [ fig : ph ] .",
    "the determination of the equivalent ( or weizscker - williams ) photon spectrum corresponding to a fast particle moving past an observer on a straight line path with impact parameter @xmath0 is a textbook example  @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath1 of a specific photon - hadron reaction to occur in a collision with an impact parameter @xmath0 is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the corresponding photoproduction cross section .",
    "the equivalent photon spectrum can be calculated analytically , a useful approximation for qualitative considerations is @xmath4 for @xmath5 and zero otherwise .",
    "the nuclear charge is given by @xmath6 , heavy ions have particularly high photon fluxes , however , this is partially offset by the lower ion - ion luminosities , as compared to the p - p case .",
    "the impact parameter b is restricted to @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the sizes of the hadrons .    for heavy ion scattering the coulomb parameter",
    "@xmath10 is much larger than unity and it is in principle possible to determine the impact parameter by measuring the angle of coulomb scattering . whereas this is experimentally feasible at lower ( @xmath11 ) energies  @xcite , this angle is too small at collider energies .",
    "so one generally measures quantities integrated over all impact parameters .",
    "too small impact parameters are recognized since the event is dominated by the violent strong interactions .",
    "the photon spectrum eq .",
    "[ eq : nb ] extends up to a maximum photon energy given by @xmath12 this energy is about 3 gev at rhic ( au - au , @xmath13 ) , and 100 gev at lhc ( pb - pb , @xmath14 ) in the collider system .",
    "for heavy ions the probability of an electromagnetic interaction in ultraperipheral collisions is especially large , and multiphoton processes occur , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we mention @xmath15 pair production where the impact parameter dependent total pair production probability @xmath1 is of order unity .",
    "multiple pairs can be produced , however they may be hard to detect due to their low transverse momentum .",
    "the nuclear giant dipole resonance is excited with probabilities of order of one third . in figure",
    "[ fig : mua ] one of the graphs is shown which leads to the electromagnetic production of a @xmath16 along with the excitation of the giant dipole resonance .",
    "these graphs can conveniently be evaluated in semiclassical or eikonal theories  @xcite .",
    "-meson and the excitation of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) . ]",
    "the giant dipole resonance decays dominantly into a neutron .",
    "this neutron is detected in the forward direction and can serve as a trigger on upc .",
    "the physics of upc at rhic and results from the star detector were covered by j. seger in the session on photon- and electroweak boson physics , from hera , rhic and tevatron to lhc .",
    "a unique feature to photoproduction in hadron - hadron collisions is an interference effect  @xcite : a vector meson can be produced by a photon originating from either of the hadrons .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this interference effect leads to a reduction of the transverse momentum spectrum of the vector mesons for small transverse momenta .",
    "another theoretical approach  @xcite leads to very similar conclusions .",
    "( preliminary ) experimental results from star / rhic indeed show a dip for small transverse momenta , see e.g. ref .",
    "the maximum photon energy scales linearly with the lorentz factor @xmath17 , see eq .",
    "3 . this leads to a significant widening of the opportunities at lhc as compared to rhic .",
    "a most promising area is low - x qcd studies .",
    "the experiments at hera have shown that photoproduction processes provide a well - understood probe of the gluon density in the proton . at lhc , such processes could be extended to invariant @xmath18 energies exceeding the maximal hera energy by a factor of 10 .",
    "this would allow to use dijet ( charm , etc . ) production to measure the gluon density in the proton and/or nucleus down to @xmath19 .",
    "ultraperipheral collisions would also allow one to study the coherent production of heavy quarkonia , @xmath20 at @xmath21 , and to investigate the propagation of small dipoles through the nuclear medium at high energies , see ref .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "dijet production via photon - gluon fusion is calculated in ref .",
    "very large rates are obtained that will considerably extend the hera x range .    in this session",
    "plans for studying upc physics with heavy ions at the lhc were covered by j.nystrand ( alice ) , d.denterria ( cms ) , and v. pozdnyakov ( atlas ) .",
    "in addition to diffractive processes in proton - proton collisions at lhc also a rich program of proton - photon and photon - photon physics can be pursued , see ref .",
    "the photon flux is lower as compared to the heavy ion case due to the @xmath22-factor , but this is at least partly compensated by higher beam luminosities .",
    "the photon spectrum is harder due to the smaller size as compared to the heavy ions , this leads to a lower value of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "possibilities for electroweak physics and beyond were presented by s.ovyn ( @xmath18 ) and t. pierzchala ( @xmath24 ) in this session .",
    "tagging on photon energy by measuring the energy loss of the scattered protons in the forward detector totem is an important feature . in this session",
    "j.pinfold reported on photon - photon , photon - pomeron and double pomeron production at cdf .",
    "a recent workshop on photoproduction at collider energies at ect*/trento was devoted to upc , the mini - proceedings can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the reviews  @xcite and the most recent preprint  @xcite reflect the gradual progess of the field .",
