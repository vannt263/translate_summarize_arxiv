    "the network study is an old field of research , which has recently become particularly active ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is largely due to the opening of an access to rich data on natural systems : the world - wide web , the internet , the various biological networks ( gene transcription , cell metabolism , protein interactions ) , the sociological networks ( citation index , collaborations , phone calls ) , etc .",
    "interesting empirical regularities have been observed , like the small - world property of networks or the frequently observed scale - free nature of degree distributions .",
    "on the theory side , the natural conceptual framework for network research is the graph theory : the nodes and the links of a graph represent the active agents and the interactions , respectively .",
    "however , it was soon realized that the classical graph theory @xcite is inadequate and has to be generalized , in order to cover the new reality .",
    "this observation has triggered , in turn , an intense theoretical activity , that led to the construction of a number of insightful models .",
    "it is clear , however , that much remains to be done .    as recalled in ref .",
    "@xcite , in studying complex systems one can adopt one of the two complementary approaches : the diachronic and the synchronic one . in the former , one focuses on the time evolution of the system , which helps discovering the dynamics at work . in the latter , one considers an ensemble of dynamically similar systems at a fixed large time , which helps identifying the generic structural traits .",
    "most of the recently constructed models adopt the diachronic approach and deal with growing networks @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this led , among others , to the remarkable discovery of the preferential attachment rule and of its crucial role in network evolution @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of the diachronic approach rests largely on master equations and related manipulations .",
    "the synchronic approach has also been advocated and various static statistical ensembles have been constructed and studied @xcite,@xcite-@xcite . here , the mathematics is that of the equilibrium statistical mechanics and probability theory .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to help establishing a bridge between the two sets of results .",
    "it will be seen that the widely accepted distinction between growing and equilibrium networks is not really correct .",
    "the truly distinctive property of growing networks , their causal structure , can be usefully incorporated in a static model .",
    "we limit ourselves to tree graphs , because in this case the use of the methods of analytic combinatorics enables one to get exact solutions .",
    "we shall discuss at length the geometry of connected tree graphs endowed with a causal structure .",
    "our discussion will cover , in particular , some of the recently popular growing network models @xcite , but we shall proceed considering static statistical ensembles of trees , employing a formalism which proved to be useful in deriving generic results for other random geometries . for example , we shall show that the causal trees have the `` small world '' property : their hausdorff dimension is infinite .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that is enables one to show at once that this property holds in a wide class of models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next two subsections we recall some basic concepts and we define the observables to be calculated later on . in sect .",
    "ii we begin by deriving a number of general results that hold for causal trees : the central role is played by a recursion relation satisfied by the partition function ( sect .",
    "this recursion relation enables one to find closed expressions for the degree distribution ( sect .",
    "iib ) , the ancestor - descendant correlation ( sect .",
    "iic ) and the two - point function measuring the distribution of shortest path lengths between pairs of nodes ( sect .",
    "iid ) . in sect .",
    "iie we establish contact between our formalism and the growing network models .",
    "this is used in sect .",
    "iif , where we calculate explicitly a set of observables for some simple growing networks . in sect .",
    "iii we compare the causal model with the maximally random one : in sect .",
    "iiia we collect all general formulae . in sect .",
    "iiib we calculate the observables , assuming the same microstate weights as in sect .",
    "iif , and we find dramatically different results .",
    "this illustrates the importance of graph symmetries . in sect .",
    "iiic we show how to construct a maximally random model with the same degree distribution as a given causal model .",
    "we stress , however , that the identity of degree distributions does not imply that geometries are similar .",
    "in particular , the average shortest path lengths are very different : generically they scale like a power of the number of nodes @xmath1 in maximally random and like @xmath2 in causal models , respectively .",
    "we conclude briefly in sect .",
    "let us recall some definitions : a _ rooted _ tree is a tree with one marked node .",
    "a _ planted _ tree is a rooted one with an extra link attached to the root , so that the degree of the root is increased by unity .",
    "the other end of this extra link is not counted as a node , in a sense this end remains `` free '' .",
    "the different tree ensembles are simply related and choosing to work with one of them is a matter of convenience . in this paper",
    "we deal with planted tree graphs @xcite .    by assumption ,",
    "a label is attached to each node and two graphs with identical topology but labeled differently are considered different .",
    "we say a tree is endowed with a _ causal structure _ when the labels always appear in growing numerical order as one moves along the tree from the root towards an arbitrary node .",
    "these are the tree graphs we are interested in .",
    "introduce a statistical ensemble of these trees .",
    "let us denote by @xmath3 a given topology and by @xmath4 the number of distinct causal labelings of @xmath3 .",
    "we attach the same weight @xmath5 to each acceptable labeling . here",
    "@xmath1 is the total number of nodes , @xmath6 denotes the degree of the node @xmath7 and @xmath8 is some appropriate positive - definite function .",
    "a model is defined by choosing a particular form of @xmath8 .",
    "it will be seen that the presence of a causal structure generates non - trivial observable inter - node correlations .",
    "hence , it is of interest to discuss models where these specific correlations do not interfere with correlations of a different origin . with this motivation , we assume in this paper that @xmath9 factorizes @xcite @xmath10 on the other hand , we keep @xmath11 as general as possible",
    ".    the partition functions of canonical and grand - canonical ensembles are defined in the usual way by summing the weights of all possible microstates .",
    "thus by definition  : @xmath12 and @xmath13    the prefactor @xmath14 in eq .",
    "is compensated by the number of terms in the summand .",
    "indeed , the number of labeled causal trees with @xmath1 nodes is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that in all cases of physical interest @xmath16 grows exponentially with @xmath1 , up to a power prefactor  : @xmath17 and @xmath18 develops a singularity at @xmath19 ( see sect .",
    "iia for a more rigorous argument ) .",
    "one is primarily interested in the regime controlled by the singular part of @xmath18 . indeed , as @xmath20 tends to zero one becomes increasingly sensitive to the behavior of trees with arbitrarily large @xmath1 .    of course , eq .",
    "can be inverted by laplace transformation @xmath21 with the integration contour passing on the right of the singularity at @xmath22 .",
    "it will often be convenient to work in the grand - canonical ensemble and to laplace transform the result to the physically more interesting canonical ensemble at the very end . in practice",
    ", we shall always assume that @xmath23 and we shall keep the leading term only .",
    "notice , that there is an analogy between the labelings of graphs and the positions of a system in a ( discrete ) phase - space .",
    "hence , @xmath9 and @xmath4 are the analogues of the weight of a microstate and of the corresponding phase - space volume , respectively .",
    "little is specific to causal trees in the content of this section .",
    "one could repeat _ verbatim _ the above definitions and keep the same microstate weights in the context of a different tree ensemble .",
    "however , in this new ensemble the trees would have different symmetries and , therefore , @xmath4 would be in general different .",
    "consequently , the physics would be different too .",
    "we shall see later , comparing causal and maximally random trees , that introducing a new symmetry can change dramatically the geometry of generic graphs .",
    "let us define the observables we shall calculate in this paper  :    the most popular observable is the _ degree distribution_. when the weight of a microstate has the factorized form , as in , the degree distribution @xmath24 is given by the simple and obvious formula @xmath25 the factor @xmath26 above is included to have the distribution normalized to unity .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath23 @xmath27",
    "the next observable is the _ correlation _ between node degrees , say the probability that a node has degree @xmath28 when its neighbor s degree is @xmath29 . in a causal tree ,",
    "one of these nodes is an _ ancestor _ and the other a _",
    "descendant_.    a very interesting observable is the _ hausdorff dimension _ @xmath0",
    "controlling the scaling with @xmath1 of the linear size of a typical tree  : @xmath30 one usually takes for @xmath31 the distance between an arbitrary pair of nodes . in rooted trees it is more natural to consider the distance separating a randomly chosen node from the root .",
    "one first calculates a specific two - point function @xmath32 , the grand - canonical weight of all trees with a node separated from the root by @xmath31 steps . using @xmath32 one finds @xmath33",
    "this quantity usually diverges when @xmath34 .",
    "the behavior on the r.h.s .",
    "( right - hand side ) of is determined by observing that @xmath35 scales like @xmath26 ( see ) .",
    "we start by deriving a recursion relation for the partition function @xmath16 . to this end",
    "we construct a new planted tree by attaching the @xmath28 `` free link - ends '' of the planted trees @xmath36 to a new root .",
    "we denote the resulting compound tree by @xmath37 ( this is illustrated in fig . 1 for @xmath38 ) .",
    "the three old roots are connected to the new root with degree four .",
    "notice that all the graphs are planted trees .",
    "the trees are not planar and therefore the relative position of branches in the compound tree is irrelevant . ,",
    "width=302 ]    the number of ordered labelings of the compound tree is @xmath39 here @xmath40 denotes the total number of nodes in the tree @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "one has to give @xmath43 labels to the nodes of the compound tree .",
    "however , the smallest label must be attached to the root .",
    "the remaining @xmath1 labels are arbitrarily distributed among the trees .",
    "this is the origin of the the multinomial factor . permuting the trees",
    "@xmath41 does not change the compound tree @xcite .",
    "this explains the presence of the factor @xmath44 .",
    "it will be seen that the _ composition rule _ is a very basic property of the model .",
    "obviously the weight of the new tree factorizes @xmath45    the partition function @xmath46 can be constructed by summing the trees of size smaller or equal to @xmath1  : @xmath47    inserting into and rearranging terms in the sum we obtain after trivial algebra  : @xmath48 adding @xmath49 and summing both sides of equation we get @xmath50 or finally @xmath51 where @xmath52 equation can be integrated to give @xmath53 the function @xmath54 is a positive monotonically growing function of z , bounded from above ( one can ignore the trivial case where all @xmath11 except @xmath55 and @xmath56 are zero ) . hence @xmath57 is bounded from below : @xmath18 has a singularity at some @xmath19 .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the radius of convergence of the series @xmath59 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath57 is given by @xmath60 this formula holds also when the radius of convergence @xmath58 is infinite , since all terms in the series are positive and the integral in is convergent in all cases of interest  : @xmath61 .",
    "the degree distribution calculated using is @xmath62 again , this formula is also valid when @xmath63 .",
    "summing over @xmath64 and using the definitions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 one easily checks that @xmath24 is normalized to unity , as it should .",
    "one further finds @xmath67 on a tree , the r.h.s .",
    "should equal 2 .",
    "this is the case when @xmath68 diverges at @xmath69 .",
    "otherwise one encounters a pathology , which looks similar to that appearing in some maximally random tree models ( and in the so - called balls - in - boxes model , see @xcite ) , where working in the large @xmath1 limit one misses singular node(s ) contributing term(s ) of the type @xmath70 . in the limit such nonuniformly behaving terms",
    "do not contribute to the normalization but do contribute to the r.h.s . of .",
    "it will be shown later that when @xmath71 the average distance between nodes is finite .",
    "this means that singular node(s ) - with unbounded connectivity - are indeed expected to show up . in deriving the large @xmath1 limit has been implicitly used and it is an educated guess that one again misses the singular node(s ) .",
    "now , we turn to the calculation of the ancestor - descendant degree correlation .",
    "it is obvious that an ancestor plays the role of the root of the subgraph involving all its descendants .",
    "one can read from the degree distribution of the root : @xmath72 going over to the grand - canonical ensemble one finds : @xmath73 which , taking into account and after integration yields @xmath74 using similar arguments one writes the weight of graphs where the root has the degree @xmath29 and its daughter the degree @xmath28 as @xmath75 hence @xmath76 integrating the above equation one finally obtains @xmath77 which is the conditional probability , up to normalization , that a descendant has the degree @xmath28 when the ancestor s degree is @xmath29 .",
    "the normalization is determined summing over @xmath28 on the r.h.s . above , with the result @xmath78 .",
    "it is a slightly different measure of neighbor correlation than that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it carries similar information . because of the integration the dependence on @xmath28 and @xmath29 does not factorize , in general .",
    ". holds in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "one would like to have an expression valid in the canonical ensemble , where the graph has a well defined number of nodes .",
    "this requires laplace transforming the r.h.s .",
    "( one should transform first and normalize next ) .",
    "one can argue that in the thermodynamical limit and in the regime @xmath34 this often amounts to just replace @xmath79 in .",
    "indeed , let @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 evaluating the integral by the saddle - point method one gets an exponential of a quantity scaling like @xmath82 .",
    "this gives a factor of unity in the limit @xmath23 , provided @xmath83 , a condition often met in applications .",
    "repeating over and over the iteration process leading to eq .",
    "one gets @xmath84 summing over node degrees @xmath85 one obtains the weight of all graphs with a point separated by @xmath31 links from the root , _ ie _ the two - point correlation function @xmath32 introduced in sect .",
    "1.2  : @xmath86 for finite @xmath58 , replacing the upper limit of integration over @xmath87 by @xmath58 and performing all integrations , one gets @xmath88 hence , the tail of @xmath32 falls at least as fast as a poissonian .",
    "consequently @xmath89 grows at most like @xmath90 . assuming that @xmath91 has at most a power singularity at @xmath92 one concludes that @xmath93 and therefore @xmath94 since @xmath35 scales like @xmath26 .",
    "the argument is rather heuristic , but suggestive ( see also the examples in the next section ) .",
    "it appears that generically the causal trees have the _ small - world _",
    "property @xmath95 , contrary to the maximum entropy trees whose generic fractal dimension is finite @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is easy to understand intuitively  : the causal structure suppresses long branches .",
    "this can be seen by noting that along a branch from the root to the leaf no label permutations are possible , hence a tree with a few long branches admits much less causal labelings then a `` short fat '' one .",
    "so far , our discussion was very general .",
    "let us now establish a bridge to the popular growing network models .",
    "of course , here we consider only those models , where one constructs tree graphs .",
    "successive nodes are attached , one at a time , the attachment probability being a function of the degree of the target node  : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of vertices with degree @xmath28 in the tree at time @xmath98 .",
    "it is obvious that the tree constructed that way has a causal structure : nodes are labeled by the attachment time .",
    "notice , that from the perspective of a model builder , the concepts of causal and growing networks are complementary rather than equivalent .",
    "a causal network is defined by specifying the microstate weights .",
    "every growing network is causal , of course , but the weights corresponding to a given growth process can have a very complicated , non - local structure . and",
    "conversely , given a set of weights it is , in general , not evident what is the corresponding growth process . only for a class of models there exists a stationary attachment kernel @xmath99 .    for linear or shifted linear attachment kernels @xmath99 the normalization factor @xmath100 depends only on the size of the previous configuration and is therefore the same for all trees of the same size @xcite .",
    "hence , the preferential attachment recipe is compatible with the factorization of @xmath9 : working in the canonical ensemble , at fixed time , we can drop the normalization factor altogether without any loss of generality and set @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath55 is some positive constant ( eventually set to 1 in explicit calculations ) .",
    "it is instructive to check by inspection that the graph weights produced by the recursion relation , coincide with those generated by the growing network model recipe .        in this model @xmath102 .",
    "therefore @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . thus @xmath106 and",
    "the solution to the equation is @xmath107 the degree distribution is found from  : @xmath108 which coincides with the solution given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the near - neighbor correlation is readily found from  : @xmath109 this is very similar to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a slightly different quantity has been calculated .",
    "the physical content is the same : the causal structure has induced correlations between the node degrees .    since in this example @xmath110\\ ] ]",
    "one has @xmath111 hence @xmath112 which implies the following scaling law  : @xmath113      now @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 of course @xmath105 and @xmath117 using the above and evaluating the euler integral that appears in the present case on the r.h.s . of one",
    "obtains @xmath118 again this reproduces exactly the result of ref .",
    "the reader can easily calculate the correlation @xmath119 .",
    "we skip this calculation here , because the result is not particularly instructive : the remarkable fact is the very existence of the correlation , not its particular form , which in this particular case is rather cumbersome .",
    "the calculation of @xmath32 is identical to that carried out for the barabasi - albert model , except that @xmath120 which implies @xmath121      for @xmath122 @xmath123 the interest of this example is in the infinite radius of convergence of the above series : @xmath63 .",
    "the degree distribution is @xmath124 a result found by several people , including the authors of ref .",
    "we again skip the calculation of @xmath119 .    since @xmath125 one finds @xmath126 and using @xmath127 one",
    "it is instructive to consider for also the well known case of maximum entropy trees ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this will help putting the results of the preceding section in proper perspective .",
    "as in the preceding section we start with the composition rule for trees , which in the present case , when the causality constraint is lifted , reads @xmath129 compared to the difference may seem tiny : one just has @xmath130 instead of @xmath131 in the numerator on the r.h.s .. it is so because there is no causality constraint and therefore all @xmath43 labels can be arbitrarily distributed among the trees",
    ". however , this tiny difference has rather dramatic consequences . indeed , repeating the steps which led from ( [ eq : l ] ) to ( [ eq : diff ] ) one obtains @xmath132 no derivative appears on the left - hand side ! instead of eq .",
    "one has @xmath133 where the function @xmath134 plays the role analogous to that of @xmath54 in the preceding section .",
    "implies that the vertex degree distribution is @xmath135 here @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the position of the maximum of the function @xmath138 .",
    "since no derivatives appear as one goes over to the grand - canonical ensemble , one does not integrate either .",
    "therefore , iterating the recursion relation one finds that @xmath139 and @xmath32 factorize .",
    "the latter equals @xmath140 as first derived by ambjrn et al @xcite using diagrammatic arguments .",
    "let us now consider three examples , with @xmath11 chosen as in sects .",
    "iif.1 - iif.3 respectively .        with this choice , that of sect .",
    "iif.1 , the function @xmath142 reads @xmath143 and has its maximum at @xmath144 .",
    "hence @xmath145 .",
    "since @xmath146 , the degree distribution calculated from is now @xmath147 as in sect . ii.f.3 !",
    "it is easy to check that for small @xmath35 one has @xmath148 and therefore @xmath149 which implies @xmath150 hence , @xmath151 , the generic value @xcite .      with the choice of sect .",
    "iif.2 the function @xmath153 has its maximum at @xmath154 , which is smaller than the radius of convergence @xmath105 of the series @xmath68 as long as @xmath155 .",
    "thus @xmath156 and @xmath157 the fall of the degree distribution is again exponential .",
    "one easily checks that again @xmath151 .      with the choice of sect .",
    "iif.3 the function @xmath159 has its maximum at @xmath160 .",
    "thus @xmath161 and correspondingly @xmath162 one can easily check that this result holds for a more general family of weights @xmath163 independently of the values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 , as long as they are positive . again",
    "@xmath151 .",
    "it is easy to adjust the input parameters of the two models to obtain identical degree distributions : suppose that in the causal model the degree distribution is @xmath24 .",
    "for a connected tree one necessarily has @xmath166 set in the maximally random model @xmath167 obviously @xmath168'(1 ) \\equiv \\sum_n ( n-2)\\pi_n = 0\\ ] ] and @xmath169''(1 ) > 0 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath142 has a maximum at @xmath170 .",
    "one easily convinces oneself that this is the only maximum of that function .",
    "furthermore , by assumption ( see ) , the radius of convergence in @xmath68 is @xmath171 .",
    "hence @xmath161 and @xmath172 by virtue of eq .",
    "however , the coincidence of the degree distributions does not imply that geometries are similar . on the contrary ,",
    "as already emphasized , the graph linear sizes have generically a very different scaling behavior in the two models ( see also some computer simulation results in @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this paper are another illustration of the claim that the opposition between diachrony and synchrony is to large extent an illusion , except if one is interested in very specific phenomena , like aging , intrinsically reflecting the running of time .",
    "we have discussed the geometry of networks endowed with a causal structure using the conventional framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "hence , models that are usually described by specific master equations and static , maximum entropy models have been treated alike .",
    "we focused on tree graphs , because only for trees we are able to proceed analytically .",
    "we have derived general formulae describing the degree distribution , the ancestor - descendant correlation and the probability a node lives at a given geodesic distance from the root . using this",
    "last results have shown that our causal networks have generically the small - world property , _ ie _ their hausdorff dimension is infinite .",
    "we have also compared the causal model with the maximally random one , assuming the same microstate weights . because of",
    "different symmetry properties of the graphs - in the causal model only a subclass of labelings is allowed - the geometries are dramatically different : in the causal model the degree distribution is qualitatively different , inter - node correlations are induced and the hausdorff dimension becomes infinite instead of being finite .",
