    "higher - rank graphs are generalizations of directed graphs that were introduced by kumjian and pask in @xcite who were motivated by the @xmath4-algebras of buildings that were studied by robertson and steger in @xcite . in this paper , we extend a higher - rank graph with sources to another higher - rank graph that has no sources .",
    "we will do this in such a way that the @xmath4-algebras of the graphs are strongly morita equivalent , thereby removing one of the technical difficulties encountered when working with higher - rank graphs .",
    "a higher - rank graph can be viewed as a union of @xmath5 directed graphs with the same vertex set , where the edges of the different graphs are painted with @xmath5 different colors .",
    "a higher - rank graph also includes a _ factorization property _ that dictates how the edges of different colors fit together to form paths .",
    "more precisely , a higher - rank graph @xmath0 , is a countable category together with a degree functor @xmath6 which satisfies the factorization property : for every @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , there are unique elements @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the rank of @xmath0 is @xmath5 , and therefore , @xmath0 is also called a @xmath5-graph .",
    "the @xmath4-algebras of higher - rank graphs include the @xmath4-algebras associated to directed graphs which have been the focus of much attention in recent years .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed account of graph @xmath4-algebras .",
    "we will use the conventions established in @xcite when discussing directed graphs . )",
    "the development of the @xmath4-algebras of higher - rank graphs has progressed in a manner similar to that of the @xmath4-algebras associated with directed graphs .",
    "the @xmath4-algebras of directed graphs were first defined in terms of groupoids @xcite .",
    "next , in @xcite , the graph @xmath4-algebra is realized as the universal @xmath4-algebra generated by a collection of projections and partial isometries satisfying certain relations . both of these methods required that the directed graphs be _ row - finite _ , that is , each vertex has finitely many edges pointing toward it .",
    "the groupoid techniques also required that the directed graph did not have any _",
    "sources_. ( a source is a vertex that does not have any edges pointing toward it . ) in @xcite , the @xmath4-algebra of an arbitrary directed graph was defined as a universal @xmath4-algebra . using a method similar to that used in @xcite for directed graphs , kumjian and pask",
    "realized the @xmath4-algebra of a higher - rank graph to be the @xmath4-algebra of a groupoid associated to the higher - rank graph .",
    "therefore , they also required that the higher - rank graphs be row - finite and have no sources ( definitions [ def : rowfinite ] and [ def : source ] ) .",
    "raeburn , sims and yeend in @xcite defined , in a universal way , the @xmath4-algebras for a class of higher - rank graphs known as _ locally convex _ @xmath5-graphs .",
    "later , they extended their definition to include the @xmath4-algebras of _ finitely aligned _",
    "@xmath5-graphs in @xcite .",
    "finitely aligned @xmath5-graphs allow for vertices to receive infinitely many edges and appear to be the most general class of @xmath5-graphs to which a @xmath4-algebra can be associated .",
    "one of the main accomplishments of drinen and tomforde in @xcite is the development of the method known as _",
    "desingularization_. if @xmath14 is a directed graph , possibly with sources and possibly not row - finite , a desingularization of @xmath15 is a row - finite directed graph without sources that is obtained from @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4-algebras associated with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , are morita equivalent .",
    "therefore , when studying with the @xmath4-algebras associated to directed graphs , it usually suffices to consider directed graphs that are row - finite and have no sources .",
    "the desingularization method , in addition to providing easier proofs for the uniqueness theorems of for graph @xmath4-algebras , also led to the description of the ideal structure of graph algebras .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "the construction detailed in this paper , which  removes sources \" from a higher - rank graph , will have similar effects on the study of higher - rank graph @xmath4-algebras .",
    "first of all , by transforming an arbitrary row - finite higher - rank graph into a locally convex graph , we will be able to use the cuntz - krieger relations from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.3 ) which are much simpler than those used to define the algebras of finitely aligned @xmath5-graphs ( definition  [ def : toeplitz - cuntz - kriegerfamily ] ) .",
    "also , the construction given here may allow for some of the results that exist for the @xmath4-algebras of row - finite higher - rank graphs without sources to be extended to more general higher - rank graph @xmath4-algebras .",
    "for example , in @xcite , evans completely describes the @xmath18-theory of the @xmath4-algebras associated to row - finite @xmath5-graphs without sources when @xmath19 and obtains some partial results for @xmath20 .",
    "robertson and sims give necessary and sufficient conditions describing when the @xmath4-algebra corresponding to a row - finite @xmath5-graph without sources is simple in @xcite .",
    "since ideal structure and @xmath18-theory is preserved under morita equivalence , it is expected that these results will hold in the more general setting .",
    "our goal is to produce a desingualrization method for higher - rank graphs that is analogous to the process used for directed graphs . if a vertex @xmath21 is a source in a directed graph @xmath14 , then the desingularization process",
    " adds a head to @xmath21 . \"",
    "this means we attach a graph of the form @xmath22_{e_{v_1}}&v_2\\ar[l]_{e_{v_2}}&v_3\\ar[l]_{e_{v_3}}&\\cdots\\ar[l]&v_{n-1}\\ar[l ] & v_{n}\\ar[l]_{e_{v_n}}&\\cdots\\ar[l]}\\ ] ] to @xmath21 .",
    "this method was used by bates , et .",
    "al . in @xcite as well as by drinen and tomforde in @xcite .",
    "in a directed graph , adding an edge to a vertex automatically creates another directed graph . therefore , dealing with sources in a directed graph is a local problem .",
    "however , in a higher - rank graph , adding an edge of some degree to one vertex will require that several edges of different degrees be added to other vertices to ensure that the factorization property still holds .",
    "hence , adding edges to a vertex in a higher - rank graph is a global issue .",
    "the method we develop here uses the so - called boundary paths of a higher - rank graph to identify the sources and then extends those boundary paths in the necessary directions .",
    "this paper is designed as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the terminology necessary to discuss the @xmath4-algebra of a finitely aligned @xmath5-graph . in section 3 , given a row - finite higher - rank graph @xmath0 , we construct a row - finite higher - rank graph @xmath1 that is source free .",
    "we show that the @xmath4-algebra of the original @xmath5-graph sits naturally inside the @xmath4-algebra of the extended @xmath5-graph as a full corner .",
    "section 4 includes examples of 2-graphs with sources and how they are extended to graphs without sources using the method in this paper .",
    "this research was part of the author s ph.d .",
    "thesis under the direction of paul muhly .",
    "the research was conducted during a year long stay at the university of newcastle , australia .",
