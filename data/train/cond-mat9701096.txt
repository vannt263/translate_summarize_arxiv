    "the standard thermostatistical formalism of boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) constitutes one of the most successful paradigms of theoretical physics .",
    "it provides the link between microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic properties of matter .",
    "inspired in shannon s information theory @xcite , jaynes @xcite reformulation of the bg theory greatly increased its power and scope .",
    "jaynes provided a general prescription for the construction of a probability distribution @xmath11 ( @xmath12 stands for a point in the relevant phase space ) , when the only available information about the system are the mean values of @xmath13 quantities    @xmath14    according to jaynes , the least biased distribution compatible with the data ( [ mean ] ) is the one that maximizes shannon s information ,    @xmath15    ( the use of the subindex @xmath16 will become transparent later on ) under the constraints imposed by the mean values ( [ mean ] ) and appropriate normalization    @xmath17    the well known answer to the above variational problem is provided by the maximum entropy ( me ) distribution    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the @xmath13 lagrange multipliers associated with the known mean values , and the partition function @xmath20 is given by    @xmath21    jaynes prescription can be regarded as a mathematical formulation of the celebrated  occam s razor \" principle . in order to obtain a statistical description of a system , given by the distribution @xmath11 , we must employ all and only the disponible data ( [ mean ] ) , without assuming any further information we do not actually have .",
    "jaynes informational approach allows to consider more general statistical ensembles than the gibbs microcanonical , canonical , and macrocanonical .",
    "also it provides a natural way to treat nonequilibrium situations .    despite its great success ,",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs - jaynes formalism is unable to deal with a variety of interesting physical problems such as the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems , some anomalous diffusion phenomena , lvy flights and distributions , turbulence , among others ( see @xcite for a more detailed list ) . in order to deal with these difficulties ,",
    "jaynes approach is compatible with exploring the possibility of building up a thermostatistics based upon an entropy functional different from the usual logarithmic entropy .",
    "recently one of us introduced @xcite the following generalized , nonextensive entropy form    @xmath22^q d{\\bf x}}{q \\ , - \\ , 1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is a real parameter characterizing the entropy functional @xmath23 .",
    "this entropy recovers @xmath24 as the @xmath3 particular instance and was introduced in order to describe systems where nonextensivity plays an important role ; if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two independent systems ( in the sense that the probabilities associated with @xmath27 factorize into those of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) we straightforwardly verify that @xmath28 . indeed , nonextensive behaviour is the common feature among the above listed problems where the usual statistics fails .",
    "the generalized nonextensive thermostatistics has already been applied to astrophysical self - gravitating systems @xcite , the solar neutrino problem @xcite , distribution of peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters @xcite , cosmology @xcite , two - dimensional turbulence in pure - electron plasma @xcite , anomalous diffusions of the lvy @xcite and correlated @xcite types , long - range magnetic and lennard - jones - like systems @xcite , simulated annealing and other optimization techniques @xcite , dynamical linear response theory @xcite , among others .",
    "the nonextensivity effects displayed by the above listed systems can arise from long - range interactions , long - range microscopic memory , or fractal space - time constraints . even for dynamical systems that  live \" in an euclidean ( nonfractal )",
    "space , if the subset ( of this space ) that the system visits ( most of the time ) during its evolution has a fractal geometry , the generalized thermostatistics might provide a better account of the situation than that provided by the usual statistics . indeed , it is well known that nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems may have fractal attractors @xcite .",
    "two of the most important dynamical quantities usually employed in order to characterize such chaotic systems , are the liapunov exponents @xcite , and the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xcite . in a recent effort @xcite ( tpz from here on ) ,",
    "generalizations for these quantities inspired in the generalized nonextensive entropy @xmath23 ( and its consequences ) were introduced .",
    "the generalized liapunov exponent @xmath29 and generalized ks - entropy @xmath30 provide a useful characterization of the dynamics corresponding to critical points where the usual liapunov exponent vanishes .",
    "for these critical cases , the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions is replaced by a power - law one , and the vanishing ( standard ) liapunov exponent @xmath31 provides but a poor description of the concomitant dynamics .",
    "on the contrary , the generalized exponent @xmath29 appropriately discriminates between the different possible power - law behaviours .",
    "tpz illustrates these ideas with the ( good old ) logistic map .",
    "it is of interest to explore this formalism as applied to other nonlinear dynamical systems . in particular , it is of importance to study families of dynamical systems characterized by a set of parameters .",
    "each member of the family will have a different onset - to - chaos critical point , with a corresponding attractor characterized by a hausdorff fractal dimension @xmath9 and a suitable value of the entropic parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the study of these families will enlighten the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the specific aim of the present paper is to study the relation between the fractal dimension @xmath9 of the onset - to - chaos attractor and the parameter @xmath8 for the logistic - like family of maps ( see @xcite and references therein )    @xmath32    ( @xmath33 $ ] ) .",
    "note that in the particular case @xmath34 we recover the standard logistic map ( in its centered representation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the @xmath8-generalizations of the liapunov exponent and the ks - entropy . in section",
    "iii the results for the logistic - like maps are presented .",
    "our main conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "let us consider , for a one dimensional dynamical system , two nearby orbits whose initial conditions differ by the small quantity @xmath35",
    ". we will assume that the time dependence of the distance between both orbits is given by the ansatz @xcite    @xmath36^\\frac{1}{1-q}\\;\\;\\ ;   ( q \\in { \\cal r})\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is our generalized liapunov exponent , and @xmath8 is a real parameter characterizing the behaviour of the system .",
    "we verify that this equation is identically satisfied for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , and that @xmath40 yields , for large times , the _ power - law _    @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\;t^{\\frac{1}{1-q } }   \\,\\,\\,\\ , ( t \\rightarrow \\infty)\\ ] ]    on the other hand , it is plain that for @xmath42 we recover the standard _ exponential _ deviation law    @xmath43 \\;\\;\\;\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is just the usual liapunov exponent .",
    "the @xmath3 scenario corresponds to situations with @xmath44 .",
    "these cases describe chaotic behaviour ( @xmath45 ) and regular behaviour ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the generalized exponent @xmath29 is intended to provide a convenient description of the marginal situations where the usual liapunov exponent vanishes ( @xmath47 ) . in these last cases",
    ", we have the power law sensibility to initial conditions given by eq.([power2 ] ) instead of the usual exponential one . the generalized deviation law ( eq.([power1 ] ) ) is inspired in the form of the @xmath8-generalized nonextensive canonical distribution , given by @xcite    @xmath48^{1/(1-q)}}{z_q},\\ ] ]    with the generalized partition function being given by    @xmath49^{1/(1-q)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the full set of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "notice that , in the limit @xmath42 , this thermal canonical equilibrium distribution reduces to the ordinary bg one    @xmath52}{z_1}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath53\\ ] ]    it is worth to remark that the marginal case with vanishing ( standard ) liapunov exponent @xmath31 displays a very rich and complex behaviour , reminiscent of what happens at the critical point of thermal equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "to just say that @xmath54 is a very poor description of its richness , intimately connected to fractality .",
    "indeed , within our generalized formalism , the parameter @xmath8 provides a characterization of the kind of power - law sensitivity to initial conditions involved , and is expected to be related to the fractal dimension @xmath9 of the corresponding attractor .    in order to discuss the generalized ks - entropy ,",
    "let us consider a partition of phase space in cells with size characterized by a linear scale @xmath55 .",
    "we will study the evolution of an ensemble of identical copies of our system .",
    "we assume that all the members of the ensemble start at @xmath38 with initial conditions belonging to one and the same cell .",
    "this means that the probability associated to that privileged cell is 1 , while the remaining cells of the partition have vanishing initial probabilities .",
    "as time goes by , and due to the sensitivity to initial conditions , our ensemble will spread over an increasing number of cells .",
    "the standard ks - entropy can be regarded as the rate of growth of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy associated with the partition probability distribution .    within the generalized nonextensive thermostatistics , the entropy functional for a discrete probability distribution @xmath56",
    "is given by    @xmath57    which , for equiprobability , becomes    @xmath58    the use of eq .",
    "( [ sqdisc ] ) , instead of @xmath59 , yields ( along zanette s lines @xcite ) to the following generalization of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy    @xmath60    that under the assumption of equiprobability reduces to    @xmath61^{(1-q)}-1}{1-q}.\\ ] ]    in both equations ( [ ksentr],[kqequi ] ) we have maintained the traditional @xmath62 which applies for a continuous time @xmath4 ; it is clear however that , in our present case , this limit does not apply since our @xmath4 is discrete .",
    "we must remark that our generalization @xmath30 of the ks entropy is different from the generalizations @xmath63 based upon renyi informations , usually called `` renyi entropies '' in the literature of thermodynamics of chaotic systems @xcite ( sometimes the parameter characterizing these generalizations of the ks entropies is called @xmath8 instead of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this parameter @xmath8 should not be confused with our @xmath8 ) .    consistently with the behavior indicated in eq .",
    "( [ power1 ] ) , we have ( along hilborn s lines @xcite )    @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ]    which , replaced into eq .",
    "( [ kqequi ] ) , immediately yields ( for 1d dynamical systems )    @xmath66    this relation holds if @xmath67 ( @xmath30 vanishes if @xmath68 ) ; it constitutes a generalization of the well known pesin equality @xmath69 ( if @xmath70 ; @xmath71 otherwise ) , and unifies ( within a single scenario for both exponential and power - law sensitivities to initial conditions ) the connection between sensitivity and rythm of loss of information .",
    "let us now illustrate some of the above concepts by focusing the logistic - like maps ( [ za ] ) .",
    "these maps are relatively well known and have been addressed in various occasions ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the _ topological _ properties associated with them ( such as the sequence of attractors while varying the parameter @xmath72 ) do not depend on @xmath73 , but the _ metrical _ properties ( such as feigenbaum s exponents ) do depend on @xmath73 .",
    "we shall exhibit herein that the same occurs with @xmath8 . indeed",
    ", although quite a lot is known for these maps , their sensitivity to the initial conditions at the onset - to - chaos has never been addressed as far as we know .",
    "as we shall see , for all values of @xmath73 , the sensitivity is of the _ weak _ type @xcite , i.e. , power - laws instead of the usual exponential ones .",
    "we present now our main numerical results .",
    "we computed , as functions of @xmath73 , the parameter @xmath8 and the critical fractal dimension @xmath9 ( determined within the box counting procedure ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we exhibit , for typical values of @xmath73 at its chaotic threshold @xmath74 and using @xmath75 , a plot of @xmath76 $ ] versus @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of iterations .",
    "( notice that for convenience we use , as argument of the logarithm , not exactly the derivative @xmath79 , but rather its absolute value ) . for each of these plots we see an upper bound",
    "whose slope equals @xmath80 ( see eq .",
    "( [ power2 ] ) ) , from which we determine @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the behaviour of the parameter @xmath8 as a function of the parameter @xmath73 characterizing the map .",
    "the figure suggests that for @xmath81 , @xmath8 tends to @xmath10 , while in the limit @xmath82 , @xmath8 approaches 1 . in fig .",
    "3 we can see , for typical values of @xmath73 at its chaotic threshold @xmath74 , the number of filled boxes as function of the number of boxes , corresponding to the box counting method employed in order to determine the fractal dimension @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "4 the behaviour of the fractal dimension @xmath9 of the chaotic critical attractor as function of @xmath73 is depicted .",
    "we can observe that , as @xmath81 , @xmath9 seems to go to 0 , while , in the limit @xmath82 , the @xmath9-curve approaches unity.in fig .",
    "5 we show the behaviour of the parameter @xmath8 as a function of the fractal dimension @xmath9 .",
    "we can see that @xmath8 displays a monotonically increasing behaviour with the fractal dimension @xmath9 . +    the particular value @xmath83 , that describes _ linear _ sensitivity to initial conditions corresponds , with notable numerical accuracy , to the fractal dimension @xmath84 ( numerically @xmath85 , occuring for @xmath86 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that as the fractal dimension tends towards 1 , the parameter @xmath8 approaches 1 .",
    "if this tendency becomes confirmed by analytic results or more powerful numerical work , this would be very enlightening , because in the limit @xmath87 the attractor loses its fractal nature ( in the sense that @xmath9 coincides with the euclidean dimension @xmath88 ) , and the usual statistics ( i.e. , the usual exponential deviation of nearby trajectories ) , characterized by @xmath3 , would be recovered . on the other extreme , as @xmath89 , @xmath8 appears to approach @xmath10 , hence @xmath90 , which can be considered as an indication of a possible _ logarithmic _ sensitivity to the initial conditions .",
    "our results are summarized in table i.    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i - * denotes the limiting values suggested by the numerical results ; @xmath91 for @xmath92 also has analytic support ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; @xmath93 for @xmath94 also has renormalization group support @xcite .",
    "we have exhibited , for a family of logistic - like maps , the behaviours of the entropic parameter @xmath8 and the fractal dimension @xmath9 of the onset - to - chaos attractor .",
    "we showed that , at this critical point , _ power _ deviation laws for nearby orbits , similar to the ones appearing @xcite in the logistic map , are observed .",
    "the concomitant value of @xmath8 is related to the chaotic attractor fractal dimension .",
    "it would no doubt be interesting to find out if , for generic nonlinear dynamical systems , @xmath8 depends only on @xmath9 ( support of the visiting frequency function ) or also upon other characteristics of the critical attractor , such as the visiting frequency function itself . in order to answer this question",
    ", it would be useful to explore the behavior of families of maps whose possible chaotic critical points depend on more than one parameter .",
    "such studies , as well as the application of these concepts to self - organized criticality @xcite , would be very welcome .",
    "+ finally , let us stress that the present study provides a direct and important insight onto a problem which has been quite ellusive up to now , namely the microscopic interpretation of the entropic index @xmath8 characterizing nonextensive statistics .",
    "the present results clearly exhibit that what determines @xmath8 is not the entire phase space within which the system is allowed to evolve ( the euclidean interval @xmath95 in the present examples ) , but the ( possibly fractal ) subset of it onto which the system is driven by its own dynamics .",
    "consistently , whenever the relevant fractal dimension approaches its associated euclidean value ( @xmath88 in the present case ) , extensivity ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) and standard bg thermostatistics naturally become , as is well known , the appropriate standpoints .",
