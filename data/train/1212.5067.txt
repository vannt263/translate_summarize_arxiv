    "the smallness of the higgs mass and the gauge coupling unification are the two salient features noted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "since the higgs quartic coupling in the tree - level potential is given by the small gauge couplings in the mssm , the relatively light higgs is favored . by supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "the small higgs mass can be protected up to the fundamental scale . as a result , the standard model ( sm )",
    "can be naturally embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) at a very high energy scale .",
    "indeed , the gauge coupling unification inferred from the renormalization group ( rg ) runnings of the three sm gauge couplings in the mssm might imply the presence of such a unified theory at the gut scale ( @xmath9 gev ) .",
    "recently , cms and atlas reported the observations of the sm higgs - like signals at 126 gev invariant mass @xcite .",
    "in fact , however , 126 gev is too heavy as the higgs mass in the mssm : the higgs mass at the tree level in the mssm is predicted to be lighter even than the @xmath10 boson mass , and so excessively large radiative correction to it for explaining the 126 gev higgs mass is indispensable .",
    "however , it could result in a fine - tuning among the soft parameters @xcite . in order to avoid such a fine - tuning ,",
    "an extension of the mssm would be necessary such that the tree level hiss mass @xcite or the radiative correction to it is enhanced @xcite .    in the next - to - mssm",
    "( nmssm ) , the `` @xmath11 term '' in the mssm superpotential is promoted to the trilinear term @xcite , @xmath12 by introducing a singlet @xmath1 and a dimensionless parameter @xmath0 . a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath1",
    "can reproduce the mssm @xmath11 term .",
    "such a trilinear term in the superpotential yields the quartic term in the higgs potential .",
    "it adds a sizable correction to the mssm higgs mass at the tree level : @xmath13 here , the first and the last terms indicate the tree level higgs mass in the mssm and radiative corrections , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 gev ) denotes the higgs vev . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ higgsmass ] ) originates from eq .",
    "( [ shh ] ) of the nmssm , which is very helpful for raising the higgs mass up to 126 gev without a serious fine - tuning among the susy breaking soft mass parameters and the @xmath10-boson mass , if @xmath0 is of order unity .",
    "the rg analysis shows that the size of @xmath0 monotonically increases with energy , and so it eventually meets a landau pole ( lp ) at a higher energy scale , if @xmath0 is too large at low energy .",
    "it is known that @xmath0 in the nmssm should be smaller than @xmath16 at the electroweak scale for @xmath0 not to blow up below the gut scale ( `` lp constraint '' ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is required to be larger than @xmath17 to achieve 126 gev higgs mass with the s - top mass ( @xmath18 ) much lighter than 1 tev , which is a necessary condition for the naturalness of the small higgs mass .",
    "the relatively small value of @xmath0 pushes @xmath19 toward unity so that @xmath20 [ @xmath21 in the tree level correction of eq .",
    "( [ higgsmass ] ) becomes almost _",
    "maximized_. thus , the perturbativity of @xmath0 and the naturalness of the higgs mass restrict the parameter space quite seriously @xcite : @xmath22 unless the `` maximal mixing scenario , '' which would also require a fine - tuning , is assumed .",
    "however , if the upper bound of @xmath0 could somehow be relaxed even slightly to @xmath23-@xmath24 with its perturbativity maintained up to the gut scale , @xmath19 can be remarkably relieved to 4 - 8 for @xmath25-@xmath26 gev , yielding the 126 gev higgs mass @xcite . in energy scales ( @xmath27 )",
    "potentially ruins the gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , it could be reversely utilized to ameliorate the precision of the unification , only if @xmath28 are not too large for the strongly coupled region @xcite . for other studies on non - perturbative @xmath0",

    "thus , one can expect that the lp constraint is relaxed by enhancing the gauge sector in which @xmath1 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are involved .",
    "for a simple analysis , we will confine our discussion only on the case of a perturbative gauge interaction . in this paper",
    ", we will attempt to relax the lp constraint by introducing new abelian gauge symmetries , under which the mssm higgs , @xmath33 ( and also the singlet @xmath1 ) are charged .",
    "then the new gauge interactions would resist the blowup of @xmath0 at higher energies",
    ". should be much heavier than the new gauge boson s mass squared @xcite .",
    "too large mass splittings of them could introduce a fine - tuning associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , which is a non - trivial constraint in this scenario . ]    in this paper , _ we intend to maintain the gauge coupling unification at the gut scale _ , which is one of the great achievements in the mssm .",
    "in fact , su(5 ) and so(10 ) guts can provide the frameworks to extend the sm gauge group @xmath34 to a simple group , keeping the gauge coupling unification .",
    "due to the gauge coupling unification and also doublet / triplet splitting in the higgs sector , however , su(5 ) and so(10 ) should be broken around the gut scale . accordingly , one need to consider product gauge groups , @xmath35 .",
    "if the new gauge group @xmath36 is a non - abelian group , the chiral matter sector of the mssm as well as the higgs sector are required to be extended by introducing more _ chiral _ fields such that they could be accommodated in non - trivial multiplets of @xmath36 . of course ,",
    "the extra chiral matter should somehow be made heavy at low energy .",
    "with such other extra matter fields , however , the gauge coupling unification might be hard to be maintained , since extra matter fields would not be guaranteed to compose su(5 ) or so(10 ) multiplets at all.su(2)@xmath37su(2)@xmath38u(1)@xmath39 is proposed to relax the lp constraint on @xmath0 .",

    "su(2)@xmath42 can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "the third family of the chiral matter and the higgs are assumed to be charged only under su(2)@xmath43 , while the first two families only under su(2)@xmath40 . on the other hand , the singlet @xmath1 remains neutral .",
    "] even in the case of a new abelian gauge symmetry , however , anomaly cancellation conditions often require also the presence of extra matter fields , which have not been yet observed in the laboratories .",
    "thus , the extra matter fields should be vector - like under the sm gauge symmetries such that they can obtain heavy masses below the breaking scale of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , they should compose su(5 ) or so(10 ) multiplets for the gauge coupling unification .",
    "as mentioned above , in this paper we are interested in gauge extensions with abelian groups in the nmssm .",
    "in fact , the extra matter is helpful for relaxing the lp constraint of @xmath0 , only if they are embedded in su(5 ) or so(10 ) multiplets and made heavy at low energies : they would result in quite larger sm gauge couplings at higher energies compared to those in the original mssm , and so enhance their negative contributions to the rg equation of @xmath0 . with five pairs of extra @xmath44 , indeed , the allowed low energy value of @xmath0 can be lifted to @xmath23 , avoiding the lp below the gut scale @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we will survey promising u(1 ) gauge symmetries in section [ sec : u(1)s ] . in section [ sec :",

    "in the search for anomaly - free combinations of extra matter under extra u(1 ) gauge symmetries , it is worthwhile to consider the u(1)s outside the sm gauge group @xmath34 , but embedded in the well - known guts such as so(10 ) and @xmath45 : it can provide a guide for constructing a consistent model with gauge anomaly - free u(1)s .",
    "but we will not discuss the guts themselves in this paper : _ we just pragmatically employ such u(1)s embedded in the guts , particularly for easily obtaining anomaly - free matter contents . _",
    "the minimal gut containing the sm gauge group is su(5 ) .",

    "are split as @xmath48 where the subscripts indicate the u(1)@xmath46 charges .",
    "the above tensor and ( anti-)fundamental representations of su(5 ) can accommodate the following mssm matter : @xmath49 where the notation for the mssm matter is self - evident . throughout this paper",

    "( [ so10matt ] ) .",
    "they spoil the gauge coupling unification , and possibly lead to too fast proton decay .",
    "thus , they should be dropped from the field content of the low energy effective theory .",
    "even without @xmath50 , the anomaly - free conditions associated with u(1)@xmath46 are still fulfilled , since they are exactly vector - like under @xmath52 . not only @xmath50 but also the mssm higgs @xmath33 carry the opposite charges @xmath53 . on the other hand , the singlet @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ shh ] ) still remains neutral . since the higgs in eq .",
    "( [ shh ] ) are charged under u(1)@xmath46 , the u(1)@xmath46 gauge symmetry could be helpful for relaxing the lp constraint on @xmath0 .    like the u(1)@xmath46",

    "the u(1 ) symmetry embedded in the su(2)@xmath55 of the pati - salam gauge group , su(4)@xmath56su(2)@xmath57su(2)@xmath55 is also an interesting gauge group .",

    "accordingly , u(1)@xmath3 can also be helpful for avoiding the lp for @xmath0 below the gut scale . according to our analysis",
    ", u(1)@xmath3 turns out to be much more efficient than u(1)@xmath46 in relaxing the lp constraint .",

    "alternatively , we can take the u(1)@xmath66 [ u(1)@xmath5 charge normalization smaller than the @xmath45 [ so(10 ) ] normalization `` @xmath67 '' [ `` @xmath68 '' ] , assuming that the u(1)@xmath3 [ u(1)@xmath5 gauge coupling is unified with the sm gauge couplings at the gut scale .",
    "we just naively anticipate that such a charge normalization of u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath46 can be supported by a proper uv theory embedding our model .",
    "of course , both yield the same result in lifting @xmath0 . throughout this paper , we take the latter choice .    for fulfilling the condition *",
    "( 2 ) * , we will assign the u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath46 charges to only one family of the mssm chiral matter and one pair of the higgs doublets together with @xmath50 and @xmath1 , which compose an anomaly - free combination of the matter .",
    "hence , the other two families of the chiral matter can not couple to the higgs , because they remain neutral under u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath46 , while the higgs doublets carry the charges .",
    "thus , we should introduce additional vector - like matter such that the desired yukawa couplings for them can be generated after u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath46 breakings .",
    "since the extra matter @xmath50 can mediate unwanted too fast proton decay , we need to introduce a ( global ) symmetry in order to forbid such a possibility",
    ".    if the u(1)@xmath3 breaking scale is too low , the condition * ( 3 ) * can be in conflict with the constraints on fcnc processes , since our u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath46 charge assignments are family - dependent .",
    "moreover , too low breaking scale of u(1)@xmath3 could affect also the precision tests of the sm gauge interactions associated with the `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath69 '' parameters .",

    ", the neutral flavor - changing couplings can be written as [ fcnc ] w_fcnc = _ i , j=1,2,3(^d_ij_i_j^c + ^e_ij_i_j^c ) h_d^0 , where @xmath408 parametrize ( yukawa couplings)@xmath409(mixing angles ) , and so they are of order the yukawa couplings or smaller . here",
    "@xmath410 denotes the neutral component of @xmath81 . after integrating out the heavy higgs @xmath97 , eq .",
    "( [ fcnc ] ) provides flavor violating four fermion interactions suppressed by @xmath411 from the k@xmath412hler potential . unlike @xmath410",
    ", @xmath413 does not give rise to flavor violations .",
    "note that @xmath413 has only the @xmath414 block - diagonal couplings of the first and second generations of the sm chiral matter , while @xmath415 couples only to the third generation .",
    "due to the hierarchical structure of the masses for the quarks and charged leptons , we employ the parametrization of cheng and sher @xcite as ^d_ij=^d_ij , ^e_ij=^e_ij , where @xmath416 ( @xmath417 ) denotes the mass of d - type quark ( charged lepton ) of the generation @xmath418 . for @xmath419 ,",
    "thus , @xmath420 become the same order of magnitude with the average of the relevant yukawa couplings .",
    "if @xmath421 turn out to be of order unity , hence , the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ fcnc ] ) can be regarded as being natural . on the other hand , if the experimental bounds requires too small @xmath421 , the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ fcnc ] ) should be finely tuned .",
    "for the quark sector , the most serious bound comes from the neutral meson ( @xmath422 ) mixing .",
    "the mass splitting is calculated as @xcite , where @xmath423 is the meson decay constant , and @xmath424 is the vacuum insertion parameters defined in @xcite . the experimental bounds on @xmath425 , @xmath426 and @xmath427 in table [ tab : bound ] constrain the parameters as ( ^d_12 ,   ^d_31 ,  ^d_32 ) ( ) ( 4.2 ,   2.5 ,   2.5 ) . the less severe constraint is from @xmath428 @xcite , which yields ( ) 37 . for the lepton sector ,",
    "the most important constraint is from the @xmath429 bound .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite ( e ) ^2 .",
    "so the resulting bound is estimated as ( ) 3.3 .",
    "therefore , all the flavor violations associated with the heavy higgs , @xmath97 can be sufficiently suppressed , only if @xmath430 .",
    "we considered the perturbative u(1 ) gauge extensions of the nmssm to relieve the lp constraint on the `` @xmath0 '' coupling , maintaining the gauge coupling unification .",
    "they are closely associated with raising the tree - level mass of the higgs . to minimize the beta function coefficient(s ) of u(1)@xmath3 or u(1)@xmath4u(1)@xmath46 , which is necessary for u(1 ) gauge interaction(s ) relevant down to low energies",
    ", we assign u(1 ) charges only to the higgs doublets and the third family of the chiral matter among the mssm field contents . in the u(1)@xmath3 [ u(1)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 case ,",
    "the low energy value of @xmath0 can be lifted up to @xmath6 [ @xmath7 , depending on the normalization of the charges , when the gauge coupling @xmath431 [ and also @xmath432 and @xmath0 are constrained not to blow up below the gut scale .",
    "we also discussed how to induce the yukawa couplings for the first and second families of the quarks and leptons , and the resulting phenomenological constraints associated with flavor violations .",
