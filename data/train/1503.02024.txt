    "<S> to conclude , we demonstrated that multicomponent superconductors with broken time - reversal symmetry , and in particular the @xmath0 state , feature in the vicinity of btrs transition , a giant thermoelectric effect of principally different nature than that in single - component superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it originates in thermally induced intercomponent counter - flows , in contrast to the counter - flows of normal and superconducting currents in the mechanism originally discussed by ginzburg . </S>",
    "<S> although related effects should be present in various multicomponent superconductors , along with multicomponent superfluids , we focused on the @xmath0 states where the effect is generic ( irrespective of the model ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the work was supported by the swedish research council grants 642 - 2013 - 7837 , 325 - 2009 - 7664 . </S>",
    "<S> the computations were performed on resources provided by the swedish national infrastructure for computing ( snic ) at national supercomputer center at linkping , sweden . </S>"
