    "is well understood via the equivalence with the classical ising model in dimension @xmath16 , i.e. the time plays the role of an extra space - dimension @xcite , and the dynamical exponent is @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , the quantum model in @xmath18 corresponds to the exactly solved 2d classical ising model , the quantum model in @xmath4 corresponds to the 3d classical ising model , and the quantum model in dimension @xmath19 is characterized by the standard mean - field exponents .",
    "from the point of view of block - renormalization for quantum models , there exists a special self - dual procedure introduced by fernandez - pacheco @xcite , which is able to reproduce the exact critical point @xmath20 and the exact correlation length exponent @xmath21 .",
    "various generalizations of this procedure to higher dimensions @xmath1 have been studied @xcite , as well as extensions to other quantum models like the potts and the ashkin - teller models @xcite .    in the disordered case , where the transverse fields @xmath22 and the couplings @xmath23 are random variables , many exact results have been obtained in @xmath18 by daniel fisher @xcite via the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization procedure ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in particular , the transition is governed by an infinite disorder fixed point and presents unconventional scaling laws with respect to the pure case . in dimension @xmath1 , the strong disorder renormalization procedure has been studied numerically with the conclusion that the transition is also governed by an infinite - disorder fixed point in dimensions @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these numerical renormalization results are in agreement with the results of independent quantum monte - carlo in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the strong disorder renormalization is thus a very powerful method , but it leads to a complicated renormalized topology for the surviving clusters as soon as @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , a large number of very weak bonds are a priori generated during the rg , that will eventually not be important for the forthcoming rg steps .",
    "this is why recent numerical implementations of strong disorder rg rules are based on algorithms avoiding this proliferation of weak generated bonds @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether infinite disorder fixed points can be also reproduced by more standard block - renormalization .",
    "recently , miyazaki and nishimori @xcite have proposed to generalize the block - renormalization of fernandez - pacheco @xcite concerning the pure model in @xmath18 , and their extension for the pure model in @xmath25 @xcite to the random case : their results are in agreement with the infinite disorder fixed point scalings . however in dimension @xmath1 , their procedure has the drawback that the various directions are treated inequivalently , so that they need to re - symmetrize afterward @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the random case , they have used some pool method that does not keep all the generated correlations between renormalized parameters , and the only critical exponent that they measure is the finite - size correlation length exponent @xmath26 , whereas it is interesting to measure also the activated exponent @xmath27 and the typical correlation length exponent @xmath28    in the present paper , we thus propose another generalization in dimensions @xmath4 and @xmath29 of the self - dual one - dimensional block - renormalization of fernandez - pacheco , that we study analytically in the pure case and numerically in the disordered case .",
