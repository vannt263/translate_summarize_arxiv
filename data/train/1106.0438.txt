    ", it managed to reconstruct some key features of the dynamics of scientific paradigms spreading , including an asymmetry between the rate of adopting a new idea by the community and the speed of its decline when new competing ideas appear .",
    "the model was based on numerical simulations and no analytical treatment was presented . in this paper ,",
    "the master equation and markov processes theory @xcite were applied to analyze the dynamics of the system in the case of small level of agents creativity for various topologies of agent interactions , such as chain , complete graph , er graphs , star and square lattice . for chain topology",
