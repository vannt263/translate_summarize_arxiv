    "although simply defined , this model has rich transport properties : for example , density heterogeneities can evolve into rarefaction or shock waves  @xcite , while an open system , with input at one end and output at the other , exhibits a variety of phases as a function of the input / output rates  @xcite .",

    "we investigate a _ cooperative exclusion _ ( ce ) model in which the velocity can _ increase _ with density .",
    "this cooperativity leads to unexpected features in the evolution of initial density heterogeneities .",
    "such cooperativity occurs , for example , when ants emit pheromones that help guide fellow ants along a trail  @xcite .",
    "another example are multiple buses that follow a fixed route .",

    "molecular motors can work together to pull a load that is too large for a single motor  @xcite .",
    "cooperativity has even been proposed as a basis for organic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the notion of cooperative interactions that counterbalance the fundamental excluded - volume interaction is implicit in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as in  @xcite .",
    "these latter publications investigated an exclusion model with a somewhat less stringent excluded - volume constraint than in asep .",
    "this weaker exclusion gives rise to an effective cooperativity and thereby to complex density profiles similar to what we find .",
    "as we shall argue , the existence of these complex profiles does not depend on detailed microscopic rules , but is rather a consequence of the underlying cooperative interactions between particles .",
    "when sufficiently strong , these interactions leads to an inflection point in the current - density curve ; this feature is the minimum requirement for the complex density - profile dynamics .",
    "in the ce model , a particle can hop to its vacant right neighbor at a rate @xmath4 that depends on the occupancy of the previous site ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) : @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath7 , the standard asep is recovered , while @xmath8 corresponds to _ facilitated _ asymmetric exclusion  @xcite , in which the left neighbor of a particle must be occupied for the particle to hop to a vacancy on the right .",
    "we pictorially view this restriction as a particle requires a `` push '' from its left neighbor to hop .",
    "this facilitation causes an unexpected discontinuity in a rarefaction wave in the asep  @xcite .",
    "more strikingly , we will show that cooperativity leads to shock and rarefaction waves that can be continuous , discontinuous , or a mixture of the two .",
    "these unusual features arise in ce when @xmath9 , where an inflection point in @xmath10 occurs at @xmath11 ( fig .",

    "a crucial feature of ce is that the probability for any steady - state configuration is a _ decreasing _ function of the number @xmath23 of adjacent vacancies : @xmath24 , with @xmath25 . to understand how the configurational probabilities depend on @xmath23 , we observe that the hopping of a pushed particle ( whose left neighbor is occupied ) either preserves or decreases the number of adjacent vacancies @xmath23 ( left side of fig .",

    "_ continuous rarefaction / compression : _ a density step gradually smooths out when the when the group velocity to the left is less than that on the right , @xmath49 . here",
    "the faster particles on the right leave open space for the slower particles , similar to a cluster of stopped cars that slowly spreads out after a stoplight turns green . in asep",
    ", a downstep always evolves to a _ continuous rarefaction _ ( r ) wave .",
    "this continuous rarefaction also occurs in ce when both initial densities are above the inflection point , @xmath50 . at these high densities",
    ", exclusion dominates , as in the asep , which causes the group velocity to decrease with density .    in striking contrast to the asep ,",
    "an upstep can continuously smooth out in ce when the initial densities are below the inflection point , @xmath51 . in this regime",
    ", cooperativity is sufficiently strong that particles in the high density region on the right move faster than those on the left .",
    "thus instead of a shock wave , a _ continuous compression _ ( c ) wave develops ( fig .",
    "[ steps ] ) .",
    "we determine the density profile by assuming that it a function of the scaled variable @xmath52 .",
    "substituting @xmath53 into the continuity equation gives @xmath54 .",
    "thus the profile consists either of constant - density segments ( @xmath55 ) or else @xmath56 .",
    "matching these solutions gives  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inverse function of @xmath56 .",
    "for a continuous profile , the cutoffs @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined by matching the interior solution @xmath58 with the asymptotic solutions : @xmath61 or equivalently , @xmath62 .",
    "_ composite rarefaction / compression and shock : _ in ce , a continuous rarefaction or compression wave can coexist with a shock wave .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the group velocity on the left is initially less than that on the right but also with the constraint that the initial densities lie on either side of the inflection point .",
    "consequently one side of the step is in the exclusion - dominated regime and the other is in the cooperativity - dominated regime , or vice - versa . in particular ,",
    "a _ composite rarefaction / inverted shock _",
    "( r / is ) wave emerges from a downstep when @xmath63 , so that @xmath49",
    ". as in the case of the continuous rarefaction wave , the downstep begins to smooth out from the rear .",
    "consequently , cooperative interactions become more important as the density at the leading edge of this rarefaction decreases .",
    "eventually this leading density reaches the point where the particle speed matches that at the bottom of the downstep and the rarefaction front terminates in an inverted shock .",
    "correspondingly , an upstep can evolve to a compression wave with a leading shock when the densities satisfy @xmath64 and @xmath49 . in this case , the leading particles initially race ahead , leaving behind a profile where the density increases with @xmath65 .",
    "however , this increase can not be continuous because eventually a point is reached where the speed at the front of this continuous wave matches that of the top of the upstep .",
    "after this point , a pile - up occurs and a shock wave forms .",
    "we call this profile a _ composite compression / shock _ ( c / s ) wave ( fig .",
    "[ steps ] ) .",
    "the functional forms of the composite rarefaction / inverted shock and composite compression / shock profiles are still given by eq .",
    "( [ rarefaction ] ) , but the criteria to determine the cutoffs @xmath66 are now slightly more involved than for continuous profiles .",
    "the location of the left cutoff , @xmath59 , is again determined by continuity , namely , @xmath67 or , alternatively , @xmath68 . to determine the right cutoff @xmath60 ,",
    "note that in a small spatial region that includes the leading - edge discontinuity , the density profile is just that of a shock or inverted shock wave .",
    "thus the equation for the shock speed is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the density just to the left of the discontinuity .",
    "( note also that @xmath71 by definition . ) to justify ( [ interface ] ) , we use the conservation equation that the particle number in @xmath72 $ ] equals the initial number plus the net flux into this region : @xmath73 we recast this expression into ( [ interface ] ) , by making the variable change @xmath74 and using @xmath75 to write the integral as @xmath76 , which can be performed by parts .",
    "the resulting expression readily simplifies to ( [ interface ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "a diversity of wave singularities arise in asymmetric exclusion with sufficiently strong cooperativity .",
    "the minimum requirement for these phenomena is an inflection point in the current - density relation @xmath10 .",
    "this inflection point leads to a group velocity that is an _ increasing _ function of density for @xmath12 , a dependence opposite to that in the conventional asep .",
    "the resulting non - monotonic density dependence of the velocity causes an initial density upstep or downstep to evolve to : shock / inverted shocks , continuous rarefaction / compression waves , or a composite profile with both continuous and discontinuous elements .",
