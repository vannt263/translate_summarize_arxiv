    "chay , georgi and grinstein  @xcite have shown that the weak decay of @xmath3 mesons can be described by a systematic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath5 , in which the leading contribution reproduces the parton - model result ( see also ref .",

    "have shown that next - order corrections are of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the qcd scale , hence expected to be small .",

    "there are also radiative qcd corrections to the decay rate  @xcite . in the leading log approximation ,",
    "double logarithms are summed to provide the sudakov factor . in @xmath0 decay , this changes significantly the shape of the electron spectrum near the endpoint .",
    "falk , jenkins , manohar and wise  @xcite have considered the validity of this resummation near the endpoint of electron energy . by studying the pattern of the summation of subleading logarithms",
    ", they have reached a conclusion that a smearing is necessary for the validity of the leading log approximation .",

    "@xcite have reached essentially the same conclusion but with a careful study of running @xmath8 .",
    "the idea of using the ope in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is that it factorizes the short - distance and the long - distance physics in terms of the product of the wilson coefficient functions and the matrix elements of local operators .",
    "so far the main focus of recent discussions has been on the systematic analysis of nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements",
    ". however the coefficient functions may be affected by nonperturbative effects as well .",
    "one of the examples is an instanton contribution .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of instantons on the coefficient functions in @xmath3 decay .",
    "due to asymptotic freedom @xmath9 as @xmath10 , we expect that the strength of a single instanton is of order @xmath11 . at large momenta",
    "this is negligible compared to perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "however the characteristic scale for @xmath12 is not @xmath5 but the momentum transfer to final hadrons .",
    "therefore near the endpoint of electron energy spectrum where @xmath12 becomes large , it is likely that instanton effects on the decay rate may grow sizably . for large momentum transfer @xmath13 to final hadrons",
    ", we expect that small instantons of size @xmath14 are most relevant .",
    "we study their effect by calculating one instanton ( + anti - instanton ) corrections to the inclusive semileptonic @xmath15 decay rate .",
    "we find that the effect is negligible in most of the the phase space except near the boundaries of the dalitz plot . at the boundaries we find that the instanton contribution becomes singular . therefore the decay rate has to be smeared in such a way that the instanton contribution remains small compared to the parton - model result .    in this estimate",
    "we use the dilute gas approximation since the main contribution comes from small instantons .",
    "instantons contribute not only to the hadronic matrix elements but also to the coefficient functions .",
    "we emphasize that we have neither attempted to calculate qcd radiative corrections in the realistic instanton background nor other nonperturbative effects such as multi - instantons or renormalons .",
    "it is possible that any of these give bigger contributions than a single instanton contribution . even in this case",
    "our estimate may still characterize a typical size of nonperturbative effects in the coefficient functions .",
    "after all the dilute instantons are the only known calculable nonperturbative effect in qcd .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the kinematics relevant to the inclusive semileptonic @xmath3 decay . in section 3",
