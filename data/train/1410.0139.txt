    "the last decades have witnessed a surge in research activities in the physical properties of biopolymers , such as double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) , filamental actin ( f - actin ) and microtubules .",
    "semiflexibility is a common feature they share ; as they preserve mechanical rigidity over a range , characterized by the persistence length @xmath3 , along their contour .",
    "( e.g. , for a dsdna , f - actin and microtubules , @xmath4 nm @xcite , @xmath5 m @xcite and @xmath6 mm @xcite respectively . ) mechanical properties of semiflexible polymers are well - captured by the kratky - porod wormlike chain ( wlc ) model @xcite , wherein the chain conformation is described by an inextensible and differentiable curve . in general , the stretching modulus for semiflexible polymers is far greater than their bending modulus , i.e. , the chains are effectively inextensible at the length for which the persistence length is relevant .    the wlc model @xcite , its subsequent modifications @xcite , and recent analyses @xcite have been very successful in describing static / mechanical properties of dsdna , such as its force - extension curve and the radial distribution function of its end - to - end distance . for the study of dynamics ,",
    "the wlc model needs to be extended .",
    "this is done by a langevin - like description of sideways excursions of the wlc .",
    "the contour length of the polymer is constrained in the original wlc model , and lagrangian multipliers of a varying degree of sophistication need to be implemented in order to enforce a contour length that is either strictly fixed @xcite , or fixed on average @xcite .",
    "this enforcement allows for the calculation of many dynamical quantities theoretically .",
    "it also makes it difficult to deal with motion along the wlc s contour @xcite , which become relevant , e.g. , in crowded conditions . in this context",
    ", we note that the standard interpretation of the `` stored lengths '' for semiflexible polymers are their ( transverse ) thermal undulations @xcite ( which are penalized ) .",
    "although this interpretation is consistent with the dynamics of stored lengths @xcite , and allows one to intuitively conceptualize chain tension along the contour , the interplay between local extensibility and dynamics remains somewhat problematic , unlike in bead - spring models .    in order to circumvent some of the difficulties , in a recent paper ( hereafter referred to as paper i )",
    "@xcite two of us recently introduced a bead - spring model for extensible semiflexible polymers in hamiltonian formulation , in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . in this paper",
    "we use this bead - spring model to study the dynamics of polymer chains which are shorter than or of the order of the persistence length . in particular",
    ", we have in mind the simulation of the dynamics of crosslinked networks of semiflexible polymers such as actin@xcite ; first making the network configurations continuous , and then discretizing them again , seems a bit indirect ; we prefer to work with a discrete model right from the start .",
    "paper i focused on dsdna and matched the model to its force extension curve in terms of two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in comparison to its groundstate value",
    ", the bead - spring hamiltonian is approximated in the first order by the hessian that is quadratic in the bead positions .",
    "the eigenmodes of the hessian provide the longitudinal ( stretching ) and transverse ( bending ) eigenmodes of the polymer , and the corresponding eigenvalues for the stretching ( longitudinal ) and the bending ( transverse ) modes , indexed by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , were shown to scale as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively for small @xmath7 .",
    "these are the characteristic signatures of semiflexible polymers @xcite . in this paper , also focused on dsdna , we exploit the knowledge on these modes to theoretically obtain some interesting dynamical quantities , such as ( i ) the end - to - end vector autocorrelation function , ( ii ) the correlation function of a bond vector in the middle of the chain , and ( iii ) the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) of a tagged bead . in the linear regime , where the modes can be taken as independent ,",
    "our ( analytical ) mode sum results for the above quantities ( i - iii ) are the following .",
    "the end - to - end vector autocorrelation function for the chain decays in time as a stretched exponential with an exponent @xmath11 , crossing over to pure exponential decay at the terminal time @xmath12 ; this exponent is partially shared with that of the wlc @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation of the orientation of the middlemost bond vector decays in time in a similar manner , but with an exponent @xmath13 ; this property , too , is partially shared with the wlc @xcite .",
    "the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of the middle bead shows anomalous diffusion with an exponent @xmath11 until time @xmath14 , beyond which its motion becomes diffusive ; this property has been reported for the wlc @xcite , as well from experiments @xcite .",
    "the full dynamics of semiflexible polymers in our model is obviously nonlinear , and we also perform simulations of the full dynamics for chains . we find that for dsdna the mode sums agree remarkably well with the numerical values obtained from simulations .",
    "this does not however mean that the nonlinearities are not present .",
    "indeed , we find that the msd of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector showcases strong nonlinear effects in the polymer dynamics , and we identify an effective @xmath2 power - law regime in its time - dependence . we show that the nonlinear effects in the msd of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector increase with increasing length for dsdna ; nevertheless , in comparison to the full mean - square displacement of the end - to - end vector the nonlinear effects remain small at all times .",
    "it is in this sense we state that the linearized dynamics suffices for dsdna fragments that are shorter than or comparable to the persistence length .    from the results above , which are expanded further in the paper in great detail , we hope that confidence can build up on our model .",
    "the results are trivially extended to other semiflexible polymers as long as the model parameter values are matched to the experimental ones , as demonstrated in paper i.    the structure of this paper is as follows . given that the model was described in a fair amount of detail in paper i , we first briefly introduce the model and describe its key characteristics ( specially those that are needed for the calculations presented in this paper ) in sec .",

    "the energy around the minimum ( i.e. , around the groundstate of the hamiltonian ) varies quadratically with the @xmath42s at the first order of approximation , and is dictated by the hessian matrix @xmath43 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix have three branches : a longitudinal one , for which the eigenvectors are aligned along the groundstate configuration ( straight rod ) of the chain , and two identical sets of transverse ones .",

    "the modes @xmath47 , having a zero eigenvalue , correspond to the center - of - mass motion .",
    "the transverse modes have also a zero eigenvalue for @xmath48 , corresponding to the invariance of the hamiltonian to an overall transverse rotation of the chain .",

    "the motion of the center - of - mass is independent of the other modes of the system and it plays no role for the properties that we consider , except for the msd of the tagged bead , which is partly due to internal motion and partly driven by the center - of - mass motion . for the other properties it is convenient to view the chain in the coordinate system where the center - of - mass is at the origin of the coordinate system .    _",
    "the modes form a complete basis _ , so any quantity that is a linear expression in the coordinates , can be expressed in terms of this basis .",
    "this is the key to analytically evaluate the quantities in the next section .",
    "the transverse modes corresponding to @xmath48 are special in the sense that they induce a rotation of the reference groundstate .",
    "the eigenvector has therefore the form @xmath53 @xmath54 is the moment of inertia of the groundstate in dimensionless units @xcite .",
    "actually the representation of the configuration in terms of modes with respect to a groundstate is redundant .",
    "one could take any fixed groundstate as reference .",
    "as the two transverse modes @xmath48 do not decay , they would grow in size due to the random forces as random walkers , indicating that the reference groundstate is not anymore in line with the actual shape of the chain .",
    "however by rotating the direction of the reference groundstate one can set the two transverse modes for @xmath48 equal to zero .",
    "the representation with vanishing transverse modes @xmath48 is unique .",
    "although the concept of the modes originate from the hessian approximation , they can be used to describe the _ full _ polymer dynamics , since they provide a _",
    "complete _ set of orthogonal basis functions . in this section",
    "we show how this can be achieved .",
    "if we denote the modes by @xmath55 , then they can be expressed in terms of the bead co - ordinates @xmath56 as @xmath57 \\ , \\phi_{n , p } , \\label{e8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the position of the @xmath23-th bead in the reference groundstate .",
    "it is important to note here that the instantaneous position of the center - of - mass of the reference groundstate , which is also its midpoint , coincides with the instantaneous position of the center - of - mass of the chain itself .",

    "as the transformation from @xmath60 to @xmath55 is orthogonal , the inverse relation reads @xmath61 note that the modes give _ deviations _ from the reference groundstate .",
