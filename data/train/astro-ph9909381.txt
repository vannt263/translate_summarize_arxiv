    "the slight steepening in the power law spectrum of the cosmic ray flux near energies of @xmath2 ev has provoked a wide range of interpretations since its discovery in air shower size spectra nearly 40 years ago@xcite .",
    "this spectral ` knee ' remains an enigma , which together with the more recently discovered flattening ( or ` ankle ' ) near @xmath3 ev provide the only known features in the arriving cosmic ray spectrum at high energy .",
    "the coincidence of the ` knee ' with the maximum energies expected from diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants , has served to cement its value as a key region for further investigation in cosmic - ray research .",
    "the features which might better connect the change in overall spectral slope with expectations from shock acceleration lie in the details of the individual elemental spectra hidden within the overall cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the accurate determination of the elemental composition across the knee region , from @xmath4 to @xmath5ev , is a crucial measurement yet to be made .",
    "recent observations of supernovae using tev @xmath6 rays have not managed to detect @xcite the signal expected from high - energy cosmic - ray collisions with local material if supernova remnants ( snr ) are the sources of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite . although egret has reported gev @xmath6 rays from some snrs @xcite , it is still unclear if the signal is produced by locally intense cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "non - thermal x - ray emissions have been detected from two snrs @xcite which have been interpreted as synchrotron emission from local electrons at energies up to @xmath7100 tev @xcite , but the source spectral slope inferred by these results seems inconsistent with the electron source spectrum derived from direct measurements .",
    "it remains the case that the most convincing argument for supernovae explosions producing the bulk of the cosmic rays arises from the staggering power required to maintain the population given the measured lifetime of particles within our galaxy . a typical value for the power needed is @xmath8erg / s ( see e.g. schlickeiser@xcite ) , based on a cosmic - ray residence time of @xmath9 years , a time - scale directly inferred from measurements of the surviving amount of the radioactive isotopes of be@xmath10@xcite and al@xmath11@xcite which are created by spallation reactions of cosmic rays on interstellar material .",
    "while direct detection above the atmosphere is clearly the most desirable method for composition determination , the fluxes of particles in this energy range are so small that a detector large enough to collect a good statistical sample up to 10pev ( 1pev=@xmath12ev ) has not yet been built .",
    "indirect detection of cosmic rays , through measurements of air showers produced in the atmosphere , can easily supply sufficient collecting power but these methods generally have poor resolution for the properties of the originating cosmic ray nucleus whose identity becomes clouded by the huge number of interactions in the air shower .",
    "further , the reconstruction of the mass of the incoming nucleus from measurements of the shower distributions at ground level is subject to systematic errors introduced by reliance on shower modeling by numerical simulations .    to address these issues",
    "we have constructed and operated a new type of experiment designed specifically for cosmic - ray measurements near the knee . this dual imaging cherenkov experiment ( dice )",
    "is a ground based air shower detector which is designed to have as little reliance as possible on the details of the air shower simulations and to have the capability of comparison with existing direct measurements at 0.1pev to provide an assessment of the overall systematic error .",
    "dice operates at the site of the chicago air shower array ( casa ) and the michigan array ( mia ) which are designed as an observatory for pev @xmath6 rays .",
    "they can also be used to examine hadronic showers since they give measurements of electron size and muon size at ground level .",
    "since the method of imaging hadronic showers in cherenkov light is a relatively recent development , we provide some more detailed description of the dice detectors and operation .",
    "the two dice telescopes are located at the casa - mia site in dugway , utah ( described in borione et al .",
    "( 1994)@xcite ) .",
    "they each consist of a 2 m diameter f/1.16 spherical mirror with a focal plane detector of 256 close packed 40 mm hexagonal photomultipliers ( pmts ) which provide @xmath13 pixels in an overall field of view @xmath14 centered about the vertical .",
    "the telescopes are on fixed mounts separated by 100 m , ( see boothby et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997)@xcite ) .",
    "cosmic - ray events within the field of view produce a focal plane image at the pmt cluster which corresponds to the direction and intensity of cherenkov light coming from the air shower . when the direction of the air shower core and the distance of the shower axis from the telescopes are known , simple geometry can be used to reconstruct the amount of light received from each altitude of the shower .",
    "the amount of cherenkov light produced is strongly correlated with the number of electrons in the shower and is used to estimate the electron size as a function of depth in the atmosphere from which the location of shower maximum can be determined .",
    "this procedure is essentially geometrical and is independent of numerical simulations except for calculations which determine the angular distribution of cherenkov light around the shower axis .",
    "the casa / mia installation and operation is described in detail in borione et al .",
    "1994@xcite . in this present work ,",
    "information from casa - mia is used to establish the event geometry and to directly measure the electron size and muon size at ground level . since the event acceptance is constrained by the dice aperture , only events within @xmath710@xmath15 of the zenith are analyzed , making the atmospheric depth of the size measurements to be essentially the same for all events at @xmath7860g/@xmath16 .",
    "for each air shower collected a simple time coincidence is used to identify the same event in both dice clusters and casa - mia .",
    "further requirements on the correlation of the dice images with each other and with the casa - mia event geometry are used to reduce the overall probability of event mismatches between the detectors to @xmath710@xmath17 .",
    "the basic independent parameters measured for each shower are shown in table [ parms ]    .*parameters measured for each event.[parms ] * [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as has been mentioned in the main text the mass derived from the muon size , equation [ eq : muemass ] , is susceptible to variations introduced by fluctuations from the location of shower maximum .",
    "although these are not as large as associated with the electron size shown in figure [ gfig ] , they produce poor resolution in the muon mass function unless corrected .",
    "a quantitative measure of this effect is shown in figure [ muxmx ]      the normalized muon mass size ( @xmath18 ) is derived from the mia muon size and the dice cherenkov energy , e(pev ) .",
    "this size is clearly correlated with @xmath19 depth at energies near 1 pev as shown .",
    "this is a weaker version of the effect shown for electrons in figure [ gfig ] .",
    "it presumably arises from more muons either decaying or reaching the end of the range for the showers with maxima higher from the ground .",
    "although at a fixed @xmath19 the muon mass function will perform as desired , the presence of fluctuations smears the possible mass resolution because of this effect .",
    "indeed as the relationship between the simulation curves ( dashed lines ) on figure [ muxmx ] and the measured data show , in general as the shower penetrates more deeply the muon content appears more ` proton - like ' as expected . to produce a more accurate mass function a variable",
    "must be introduced to offset the effect of shower depth shown in the figure . since electron size",
    "is closely correlated with @xmath19 , as shown in figure [ gfig ] , this can be used to make a correction and provide a mass function from the ground sizes which is completely independent from the @xmath19 measurement of dice and therefore provide a separate mass estimate for each shower .",
    "figure [ muxmx ] shows the basis for this correction . for showers near 1 pev the average muon size , normalized by the cherenkov energy ,",
    "is plotted against the normalized electron size .",
    "the variations in these sizes come predominantly from the fluctuations in @xmath19 between showers .",
    "figure [ muxmx ] represents on average how the muon size changes with electron size due to these fluctuations .",
    "the dashed line is a linear fit to these data with a slope of 0.5 .",
    "the electron size correction to the muon size mass measure is therefore of the form :      where @xmath21 as before , and where the second term corrects for the average electron size increase with energy .",
    "this effectively provides a correction for the muon size growth with @xmath19 shown in figure [ muxmx ] ."
