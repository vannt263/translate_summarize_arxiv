    "<S> we propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field . </S>",
    "<S> the first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field . </S>"
