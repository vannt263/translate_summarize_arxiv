    "many standard model ( sm ) extensions predict the existence of right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos , which are often used to explain neutrino masses via the type i seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the effective mass matrix of the light majorana neutrinos is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mass matrices for the dirac and rh majorana neutrinos , respectively .",
    "in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , the light neutrino mass matrix is described by 9 real parameters and can be written as  @xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are real and nonnegative , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 after decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , five parameters ( three mixing angles and two mass - squared differences ) in the neutrino sector have been determined to rather good precision .",
    "however , the hierarchy of the three light neutrino masses is still unknown , and there are two possibilities : _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath7 for the normal hierarchy ( nh ) and _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath8 for the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "the remaining four unknown parameters may be taken as the lightest mass ( @xmath9 for the nh , or @xmath10 for the ih ) , the dirac cp phase @xmath11 and two majorana phases ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . the dirac phase and the mass hierarchy",
    "will be measured in future neutrino oscillation experiments , and the lightest mass can in principle be determined from beta decay experiments and cosmological observations .",
    "of the many neutrino mixing models proposed in the literature , texture zero models  @xcite are attractive because of the simple relations on the matrix elements that are found in these models .",
    "texture zero constraints can be imposed on the light neutrino mass matrix directly . however , in the context of the type i seesaw mechanism , since the light mass matrix is a product of the dirac mass matrix and the rh neutrino mass matrix , it is natural to consider texture zeros in the dirac and rh neutrino mass matrices  @xcite .",
    "zeros in the dirac and rh neutrino mass matrix can be realized from discrete @xmath14 symmetries with suitable scalar singlets  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a systematic study of the constraints that result from various zero textures in both the dirac and rh majorana mass matrices in the context of the type i seesaw mechanism .",
    "we find that most cases lead to the standard constraints which can be expressed in the form of just one or two element / cofactor zeros , which have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite . however , there are also 9 classes of _ nonstandard _ constraints , i.e. , constraints which are not described by simple texture or cofactor zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we first show that both the standard and nonstandard constraints are stable under one - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) running from the lightest rh neutrino mass scale @xmath15 to the electroweak scale @xmath16",
    ". then we study the phenomenological implications of the nonstandard constraints using recent data measured by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we find that some cases are excluded , and for the rest we obtain preferred values for the lightest mass and dirac cp phase , which will be probed in the next generation of neutrino experiments .",
    "we also study neutrinoless double beta decay for the nonstandard constraints .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we explore the constraints of zero textures in the seesaw mechanism . in section  3",
    ", we discuss rge effects on the constraints . in section  4 , we study the phenomenological implications of the nonstandard constraints and summarize our results in section  5 .",
    "we consider three generations of rh majorana neutrinos and we assume @xmath2 is not singular . since the majorana mass matrix is symmetric , there are 6 independent matrix elements in @xmath2 , and 9 independent elements in @xmath1 . for a case with @xmath17 zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath18 zeros in @xmath1 , there are should be at least @xmath19 complex constraints on the elements of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total number of zeros element .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "we start with @xmath22 nonzero complex parameters in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "there are a total of @xmath23 zeros in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , so that leaves @xmath24 independent complex parameters .",
    "we can always insert a diagonal matrix between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( and the same matrix between @xmath2 and @xmath25 ) , which effectively absorbs 3 complex parameters ( or , putting it another way , there are 3 relative normalizations that are redundant in the prediction of the light neutrino mass matrix from the seesaw mechanism ) .",
    "this leaves us with 12 - n independent complex parameters . in @xmath20",
    "there are 6 independent elements , so the net number of constraints on the elements of @xmath20 is @xmath26 . in terms of real parameters",
    ", we have @xmath27 , from which we can subtract 3 unphysical phases , leaving us with @xmath28 physical real parameters in @xmath20 .",
    "since there are 9 real parameters in the neutrino sector and 5 of them are well determined , in general , if @xmath29 , the model will be over constrained and if @xmath30 , the model will be unconstrained .",
    "this counting rule only gives the minimum number of constraints .",
    "there are accidental constraints that result from some special combinations of texture zeros in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , e.g. , if @xmath1 has a column or a submatrix composed of all zeros , then the constraint @xmath31 always exists regardless of the counting rule .",
    "so in order to obtain all the constraints for a given zero structure of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we have to make sure all of the independent constraints are obtained .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "we scan all possible texture zero structures for @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath20 is invariant under a permutation of the columns and rows of @xmath2 with a simultaneous permutation of the corresponding columns of @xmath1 , we only consider one representative structure for each set of @xmath2 that are equivalent under permutation .",
    "for each combination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we check all the elements and cofactors , and the determinant of @xmath20 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mseesaw ] ) and look for independent constraints .",
    "we write the constraints in terms of the elements , cofactors or determinant of @xmath20 in the simplest form .",
    "the experimental data does not allow more than two zeros in the elements or cofactors of the light mass matrix , hence we only consider cases that give less than three such zeros .",
    "the cases that give a block diagonal mass matrix are also ignored because they lead to a zero mixing angle , which is excluded by current experimental data . for the other cases ,",
    "we analyze the elements of @xmath20 , and make sure we obtain all of the independent constraints .",
    "we find that most constraints can be expressed in the standard form that can be written in terms of just one or two element / cofactor zeros , but there are also nine nonstandard constraints , which are listed in table  [ tb : constraints ] .",
    "the structures that lead to the nonstandard constraints are provided in appendix  [ ap : structure ] .",

    "<S> in the context of the type i seesaw mechanism , we carry out a systematic study of the constraints that result from zeros in both the dirac and right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices . we find that most constraints can be expressed in the standard form with one or two element / cofactor zeros alone , while there are 9 classes of _ nonstandard _ constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all the constraints are stable under one - loop renormalization group running from the lightest right - handed neutrino mass scale to the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> we study the predictions of the nonstandard constraints for the lightest neutrino mass , dirac cp phase and neutrinoless double beta decay . </S>"
