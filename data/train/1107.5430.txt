    "liquid crystal elastomers ( lces ) are soft solids composed of flexible polymers , with attached liquid crystalline mesogens , crosslinked into a network @xcite .",
    "a variety of liquid crystalline phases of lces have been synthesized , including the nematic and smectic phases .",
    "the nematic phase undergoes deformation at no energy cost , known as soft elasticity @xcite in both monodomain samples stretched perpendicular to the director @xcite , and in some types of polydomain samples @xcite .",
    "soft elasticity in nematic elastomers requires several sympathetic shears to develop during the deformation as the director rotates .",
    "the deformation of the sample must also obey the boundary conditions imposed by the clamps .",
    "thus , the sample forms a striped microstructure on the micrometre length scale consisting of domains in which the director rotates in opposite directions in adjacent domains @xcite . without this microstructure",
    "soft deformations would not be possible . in nematics",
    "this microstructure has been observed in some detail experimentally @xcite , and its mathematical properties described @xcite .",
    "theoretically an ideal nematic lce should be perfectly soft , however in practise a small force must be applied to deform the lce .",
    "this semi - soft behaviour is due to various imperfections in the elastomer , and can be incorporated into theoretical models by the addition of a semi - soft energy term that penalises rotation of the director with respect to the rubber matrix @xcite .",
    "smectic lces have been fabricated in both the smectic-@xmath1 ( sm-@xmath1 ) and smectic-@xmath0 ( sm-@xmath0 ) phases , and with both main chain @xcite and side chain @xcite architectures .",
    "their mechanical behaviour can be modelled by adding in the embedded smectic layers to the nematic elasticity free energy @xcite .",
    "sm-@xmath1 elastomers with a high degree of smectic order exhibit a sharp change in their elastic deformation when deformed parallel to the layer normal , and are extremely anisotropic materials , behaving as 2-d elastic materials @xcite . however , the response of smectic elastomers depends on the chemistry , the crosslinking procedure , and domain sizes in the sample @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nematic phase the sm-@xmath1 phase does not show any soft elastic behaviour because the director is locked parallel to the layer normal . however , the elastic behaviour of sm-@xmath0 elastomers is predicted to be more complex .",
    "the director is free to rotate on a cone around the layer normal , with fixed tilt angle as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudomd ] a ) . as a consequence",
    "it is predicted to have a soft elastic mode just as in nematic elastomers @xcite .",

    "are predicted to deform softly with clamped boundary conditions @xcite .    to test these theoretical results experimentally ,",
    "a monodomain must be produced which requires alignment of both the layer normal and the director . using a two - stage crosslinking method , the director field",
    "can be uniformly aligned @xcite . however",
    ", the layer normals are tilted at a fixed angle on a cone around the director .",
    "we will refer to this as a _ pseudo - monodomain _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudomd ] b ) ) @xcite in order to distinguish it from a monodomain , which has both the layer normal and the director uniformly aligned , and polydomain , which has random director and layer normal alignment .",
    "the layer normals in the pseudo - monodomain can be aligned by a second uniaxial deformation perpendicular to one of the layer normals @xcite , or alternatively by a shear deformation perpendicular to the director @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "no mechanical experiments on monodomain sm-@xmath0 elastomers have been reported , perhaps because of the difficulty in aligning these samples . however , the spontaneous deformations associated with changing the phase of the elastomer from sm-@xmath1 to sm-@xmath0 have been observed @xcite .",
    "many more experiments have been carried out on the more accessible polydomain system @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "as with many polydomain systems , this is more difficult to model theoretically",
    ".    the director reorientation in soft modes may be particularly important for the electromechanical properties of chiral sm-@xmath2 phase elastomers @xcite .",
    "the liquid crystal rods have a permanent dipole moment that is aligned perpendicular to both the director , and the layer normal .",
    "the coupling between the macroscopic mechanical deformations , and the microscopic orientation of these dipoles results in their piezoelectric properties .",

    "[ sec : elongations ] we will illustrate the effect of the semi - soft elastic term in four different geometries .",
    "we will then summarise the effect of this term , and discuss the model predictions in relation to the mechanical experiments in polydomains in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the model of a sm-@xmath0 elastomer that will be used here is described in refs .",
    "the free energy has contributions from the nematic elasticity @xmath3 , smectic layer spacing @xmath4 , and the energy penalty for changing the tilt of the director with respect to the layer normal @xmath5 .",

    "a sm-@xmath0 elastomer should have a biaxial shape tensor for the polymer backbone because its shape may be affected by both the director alignment and the layer normal direction .",
    "for simplicity we will approximate it as uniaxial here , depending only on the director .",
    "we will also assume that the nematic and smectic order parameters remain fixed throughout the deformation .",
    "it is assumed that the smectic layers are embedded in the rubber matrix , so that the corresponding layer normals @xmath16 will deform like embedded planes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the initial layer normal .",
    "the layer spacing is penalised by the smectic liquid crystal modulus @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the final layer spacing , and @xmath22 is the initial layer spacing , and @xmath23 .",

    ".    it will be assumed here that the bulk modulus of the rubber is much larger that the shear , tilt and smectic moduli , so that the deformation gradient obeys , hence it conserves volume .",
    "typically the smectic layer modulus is very large compared to the rubber shear modulus , i.e. @xmath30 ( at least in smectic elastomers of a similar type to that of nishikawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the layer spacing remains almost fixed .",
    "the tilt modulus is also large compared to the shear modulus @xmath31 , so that the tilt angle remains close to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the free energy outlined above permits the subset of the nematic soft modes that maintain the layer spacing .",
    "there is only one soft mode that satisfies this ( up to a global rotation ) , and it corresponds to a rotation of the director about the layer normal @xcite .",
    "we summarise some of the properties of this soft mode here , as they are crucial in understanding the semi - soft response of the elastomer .",
    "we assume that the layer normal points along the @xmath32 direction , and the director is tilted into the @xmath33 direction , i.e. @xmath34 and in the starting state .",
    "the soft modes can be parameterised by the angle @xmath35 which gives the rotation of the director @xmath10 around the layer normal towards the @xmath36 direction .",

    "alternative mechanisms of producing auxetic behaviour based on modifying the attachment of mesogens to the polymer backbone in smectic lces have been proposed and investigated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the incremental poisson s ratio ( ipr ) is defined by @xmath50 where an elongation @xmath48 is imposed and @xmath47 is the transverse deformation . for isotropic materials , the poisson s ratio must be in the range @xmath51 .",
    "lces are anisotropic materials , so have poisson s ratios outside this range .",
    "as the materials considered here are volume conserving , the poisson s ratio in the @xmath52 direction is @xmath53 .",
    "when stretching parallel to the layer normal , the poisson s ratio at @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 substituting in typical values of @xmath56 radians , and @xmath57 for a side chain system produces @xmath58 .",

    "( [ eqn : ss ] ) is well founded in nematic lces , so serves as a starting point for smectic lces .",

    "this constrained minimisation can only be performed analytically in a few circumstances .",
    "numerical minimisation of this free energy using conventional methods often results in the location of only local minima .",
    "we have used a simulated annealing algorithm to minimise the total free energy , which finds the global free energy minimum more reliably .",

    "understanding the elastic deformations of a semi - soft monodomain is a useful step towards modelling the experimentally more accessible polydomain sample .",

    "the @xmath132 component in the soft mode is initially of the form @xmath133 ( where here @xmath134 . when this is put into the neo - hookean free energy , it results in free energy terms to leading order in @xmath128 of the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the corresponding shear modulus for this mode . in the case of the semi - soft sm-@xmath0 elastomer",
    ", this term arises because of the rapid rotation of the director during the start of the soft mode .",
    "the total free energy is then @xmath137 where first spring in this system is hookean , and the second is non - linear , being infinitely stiff at zero strain for @xmath138 , but softening rapidly as strain increases .",
    "this should be minimised over @xmath128 to determine the distribution of strain between the two springs .",

    "the behaviour of this model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : toydiscont ] . for small @xmath140",
    "this system has a discontinuity in the stress - strain curve , but as @xmath140 is increased the stress - strain response becomes continuous .    the free energy as a function of @xmath128 is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : toydiscont ] . for small values of @xmath141",
    "there is only one minimum at @xmath142 , corresponding to no strain of the second spring .",
    "however , as the total strain increases , the second mode of deformation becomes activated and there is a minimum for larger values of @xmath128 . since there is a barrier between the two minima ,",
    "the transition is first order , so there is a jump in the equilibrium value of @xmath128 . for larger values of @xmath140",
    "the phase transition becomes continuous , and the stress - strain curve no longer exhibits a jump .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to that of the semi - soft sm-@xmath0 elastomer as the free energy exhibits a discontinuity when stretched perpendicular to the director ( where the soft mode has a singular edge ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath140 correspond to stretching at a larger angle to the director , where the soft mode does not have such a rapid rotation of the director , and a corresponding sharp drop in the lateral dimension .",
    "if the angle between the director and the elongation direction is large enough , then the stress - strain response becomes continuous as we will see in the next section .",

    "the numerical solution of stress - strain curve associated with this geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sskqc ] .",
    "the stress - strain curve is continuous in this geometry , but again has a pronounced negative slope .",
    "there is a negative ipr of @xmath144 that is roughly independent of the semi - soft parameter .",
    "the expansion of the sample that accompanies the rotation of the director can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kqcdef ] .",
    "the first three deformations considered above in fig .  [ fig : geom ] ( a - c ) , when made with clamped boundary conditions , would not be soft even without the semi - soft elastic term .",
    "this is because no microstructure can be constructed from the soft deformations that is compatible with the boundary conditions , due to the shear components in the sm-@xmath0 soft mode @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of a long sheet of sm-@xmath0 lce may approximate this behaviour as the centre of the sample could deform without rigid boundary conditions . the final deformation in fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] d ) can be performed with clamped boundary conditions in the soft case . in the semi -",
    "soft case the sample starts to shear before the onset of rotation , which is not compatible with clamped boundaries , so in experiment it may be even stiffer initially due to this additional constraint on its deformation .",
    "the maximum lateral expansion can be deduced from the soft mode presented in  [ sec : softmodes ] .",
    "the shear components are transformed , through a rotation , into an elongation . at @xmath145",
    "the maximum lateral expansion occurs ( in the @xmath52 direction for the example given in the text ) , and has a value of @xmath146 .",
    "the region of negative slope in the constitutive models reported here is typically explained by a maxwell construction .",
    "similar behaviour occurs in the van der waals gas model which has a region of negative slope in the pressure - volume curve .",
    "here there is a two phase region consisting of a mixture of the liquid and gas phases . in solids the two deformations on either side of the instability",
    "must be compatible to form a mixture @xcite .",
    "the system should then disproportionate , adopting a mixture of the two deformations to achieve the externally imposed strain .",
    "the first order type phase transition seen in the example stretching perpendicular to the layer normal can result in hysteretic behaviour as the system jumps from one energy well to another .",
    "the rate of the deformation in comparison to the sample relaxation times may also result in hysteresis @xcite .",
    "there is interest in negative stiffness materials @xcite for applications such as sealants , stiffening composites , and creating meta - materials having a negative refractive index to sound waves .",
    "experimental work reporting mechanical testing on sm-@xmath0 monodomains has not been reported . whilst it is anticipated that these monodomains should exhibit soft elasticity",
    ", the addition of the semi - soft elasticity term to the model suggests that these effects may be difficult to observe for large semi - soft parameter @xmath63 .",
    "when stretching perpendicular to both the layer normal and the director , the semi - soft term may prevent any stress plateau being observed , instead only a shoulder is visible in the stress - strain response .",
    "although we have only considered the deformations of monodomains here , the results inform model predictions for polydomains .",
    "polydomains are difficult to model because of the requirement of ensuring that adjacent domains deform in a compatible way . a simplifying approximation used to model",
    "a polydomain is to assume that it consists of an array of monodomains that deform at the imposed external strain , but are independent from each other .",
    "if we deform the pseudo - monodomain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudomd ] by stretching in the @xmath36 direction , then deformation component @xmath118 averaged over all the domains is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyyy ] for @xmath147 domains .",
    "this figure shows that there is a negative ipr as the director in each of the domains jumps causing them to expand .",
    "the curve illustrated here is jagged because the alignment of each domain jumps at a slightly different threshold .",
    "the expansion of the film thickness , and the energy loss as a result of the jump in the director orientation in this geometry may be observable in experiments on pseudo - monodomains @xcite .",
    "the larger values of deformation reported in experiment before the knee in the stress - strain curve point to a much larger value of @xmath63 than in the illustrative plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyyy ] .",
    "the features of the smectic-@xmath0 model described here would be present in a wide range of models that have soft modes of nematic elastomers but incorporate the constraint on the director to remain at a fixed angle to the layer normal .",
    "however , validation of these models await either experimental work on mechanical testing of sm-@xmath0 monodomains , or theoretical work on pseudo - monodomains to link up with existing mechanical experiments on pseudo - mododomains .",
    "we have studied a model of monodomain sm-@xmath0 lces with the inclusion of a semi - soft elastic term to describe imperfections in the elastomer . as result of the negative incremental poisson s ratio inherent in the soft modes of a sm-@xmath0 monodomain , the mechanical properties of a semi - soft monodomain are unusual . when stretching perpendicular to the layer normal and the director , the response is reminiscent of a nematic elastomer .",
    "a finite force is required to deform the lce and initial the rotation of the director .",
    "however , the stress plateau is less well defined for larger values of semi - soft parameter @xmath63 ; it is reduced to a shoulder in the stress - strain response . when stretching parallel to the layer normal the elastomer again exhibits a threshold to director rotation . once director rotation has started the elastomer",
    "has a negative incremental poisson s ratio , and a negative stiffness",
    ". a negative incremental poisson s ratio of up to @xmath148 has been found for typical model parameters .",
    "this arises because the director rotates in a direction perpendicular to the stretch axis due to the constraint of the layer normal .",
    "this more detailed understanding of monodomain deformations of sm-@xmath0 elastomers might prove useful in understanding recent mechanical and piezoelectric experiments on polydomain sm-@xmath0 elastomers .",

    "note that in general an additional rotation around the @xmath32 axis may be required to ensure the director is in this orientation .",
