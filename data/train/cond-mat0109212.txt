    "the aim of this review is to summarise recent works devoted to the dynamics of ferromagnetic spin systems after a quench from infinite temperature to their critical temperature .",
    "the initial impetus for such an investigation was the desire to put to the test , on simple models , some recent ideas on the slow dynamics of nonequilibrium systems ( aging of two - time quantities and violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) . by simple models",
    "we mean models with no quenched disorder , with , for some of them at least , the virtue of being solvable . here",
    "we address the case of ferromagnetic spin systems , such as the ising model in one and two dimensions , and the spherical model in arbitrary dimension .",
    "urn models are also simple enough to serve the same purpose .",
    "they are the subject of another review in this volume @xcite .    during the course of this investigation we realised the interest of posing the same questions for nonequilibrium critical dynamics @xcite .",
    "consider a generic spin system evolving at constant temperature from a disordered initial configuration .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , be two successive instants of time , and @xmath3 , their difference .",
    "denoting by @xmath4 the spin at time @xmath1 , we consider the correlation @xmath5 and the local response to a time - dependent external magnetic field @xmath6@xmath7    at equilibrium , that is when the waiting time @xmath0 is large compared to the equilibration time @xmath8 , these functions are stationary .",
    "they only depend on the time difference @xmath9 : @xmath10 and are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( for a simple presentation see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath11 this situation is typical of the high - temperature regime ( e.g. @xmath12 for a ferromagnet ) , where @xmath8 is small .    in experiments or simulations , instead of measuring @xmath13 ,",
    "one considers the integrated response , i.e. , either the thermoremanent magnetisation of the system at time @xmath1 , @xmath14 , obtained after applying a small magnetic field @xmath15 , constant between @xmath16 and @xmath0 ; or the zero - field - cooled magnetisation @xmath17 , where now @xmath15 is constant between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "defining the reduced integrated response @xmath18 by @xmath19 we thus have @xmath20    at equilibrium , using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we have @xmath21 thus a plot of @xmath22 against @xmath23 is given by a straight line of slope @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) or @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , as soon as @xmath0 is large enough .    at low temperature ( below @xmath28 for a ferromagnet ) , @xmath8 is either very large or infinite . in the scaling regime",
    "where @xmath29 , aging takes place , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath30 are no longer stationary , and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem does not hold . the question is therefore to determine the relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath30 , if any .",
    "this can be done by defining the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath31 by @xcite @xmath32    assume that , in the scaling regime , all the time dependence of @xmath30 can be parameterised by @xmath23 . or , in other words , that @xmath23 acts as a clock for @xmath30 .",
    "that is , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 as a consequence , we have @xmath35 hence , in a plot of @xmath22 against @xmath23 , the slope at a given point is given by @xmath36 .",
    "this behaviour has been observed in a number of instances . in particular , a census of the different cases of spin systems hitherto studied shows the existence of three main types of behaviour at low temperature ( for a summary , see @xcite , and references therein ) . for domain - growth models ,",
    "@xmath37 is discontinuous in @xmath23 , taking a first value equal to  @xmath38 , and a second one equal to zero @xcite ( see discussion in section 2 ) . for spin - glass models with @xmath39-spin interactions ,",
    "@xmath37 is still discontinuous but the second value is non - zero . finally , for continuous spin - glass models , @xmath37 is a non - trivial curve @xcite .    in the present review",
    "we show that , at @xmath40 , non - trivial statements can be formulated on the same issue .",
    "hereafter we specialise to ferromagnetic spin systems .",
    "we take as representatives the ising model in one and two dimensions , and the spherical model in arbitrary dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian describing these models reads @xmath41 where the first sum runs over pairs of neighbouring sites .    for the ising model , @xmath42 , and the (",
    "non - conserved glauber ) dynamics is governed by the heat - bath rule : @xmath43 where the local field reads @xmath44 , the sum running over the neighbours of site @xmath45 .    for the spherical model , @xmath46 is a real number with the constraint @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of spins @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath49 in the right side , @xmath50 is a lagrange multiplier ensuring the constraint , and @xmath51 is a gaussian white noise with correlation @xmath52 .    in both cases , at time @xmath16 , the system is in a disordered initial configuration ( e.g. corresponding to equilibrium at infinite temperature ) .",
    "we first describe in more detail the behaviour of correlation and response at low temperature , for a generic ferromagnetic model such as the spherical model or the 2d ising model , evolving at constant temperature after a quench from @xmath53 down to @xmath54 .",
    "we defer the discussion of the 1d ising model to section 4 .",
    "in such a situation , domains of opposite sign grow , with a characteristic size @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the growth exponent @xcite .    in a first regime ( @xmath57 ) , dynamics is stationary .",
    "correlations decay from @xmath58 , to the plateau value @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the equilibrium magnetisation .",
    "though the system becomes stationary , it is still coarsening , and therefore does not reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "however the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds , and @xmath61 .    in the scaling regime where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are simultaneously large ( @xmath33 ) , with arbitrary ratio @xmath62 , aging takes place , and correlations behave as @xcite @xmath63 for small temporal separations ( @xmath64 , or @xmath65 ) , we have @xmath66 , implying @xmath67 . in other words ,",
    "equation ( [ cts_coars ] ) describes the departure from the plateau value @xmath68 . for well - separated times",
    "( @xmath69 , or @xmath70 ) @xmath71 decays algebraically as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the autocorrelation exponent @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we have @xmath74 with @xmath75 , at large @xmath76 .    in the same regime",
    "it is reasonable to make the scaling assumption ( see discussion below ) @xmath77 with an unknown exponent @xmath78 , and with again the decay at large @xmath76 @xmath79 we have therefore @xmath80 the fluctuation - dissipation ratio thus vanishes in the scaling regime , irrespective of the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "for instance , for the spherical model , the equilibrium magnetisation reads @xmath82 and the correlation @xmath83 is given by ( [ cts_coars ] ) with @xmath84 hence the autocorrelation exponent @xmath85 .",
    "the response is given , in the scaling regime , by @xcite @xmath86 which is in agreement with the form ( [ rts_coars ] ) , with scaling function @xmath87 and the exponent @xmath88 .",
    "for the 2d ising model , the exponent @xmath89 @xcite is only known numerically .",
    "this is also the case of the scaling functions @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "the latter work is compatible with @xmath92 , as predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that the integrated response scales as @xmath93 for soft spin models with non - conserved dynamics .",
    "in summary , for a ferromagnetic spin system @xcite ,    @xmath94 : :    for short times ( @xmath64 ) , such that    @xmath95 , the fluctuation - dissipation    theorem holds , and @xmath61 ; @xmath94 : :    for long times ( @xmath96 ) , such that    @xmath97 , the fluctuation - dissipation    theorem does not hold , and @xmath98    independently of the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "note that we have @xmath99 in agreement with the static interpretation of @xmath37 in terms of the distribution of overlaps @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the system is now quenched from @xmath53 down to @xmath28 .    in such circumstances ,",
    "spatial correlations develop in the system , just as in the critical state , but only over a length scale which grows like @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the dynamic critical exponent . on scales smaller than @xmath101 the system looks critical , while on larger scales the system is still disordered .",
    "for instance , the equal - time correlation function @xmath103 scales as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the usual static exponents .",
    "( a summary of the values of exponents is given in the table . )",
    "the scaling function @xmath107 goes to a constant as @xmath108 , while it falls off very rapidly when @xmath109 .",
    "the same temporal regimes , as defined in the previous section , are to be considered .",
    "however , their physical interpretation is slightly different , since the order parameter @xmath68 vanishes and symmetry between the phases is restored .    in the first regime ( @xmath110 ) , the system again becomes stationary , so that the fluctuation - dissipation holds .    in the scaling regime ( @xmath111 ) , temporal correlations behave as , @xmath112 , etc . for the scaling functions appearing in this section , though they are different from those appearing in the previous section .",
    "we use the same convention for the amplitudes @xmath113 , @xmath114 , etc . ]",
    "@xmath115 it is instructive to relate this behaviour to that observed for @xmath54 , namely , @xmath116 .",
    "the passage from one formula to the other one is done by noticing that in the critical region one has @xmath117 . replacing @xmath118 by @xmath119",
    "implies the replacement of @xmath120 by @xmath121 .    at large time separations ( @xmath70 ) we have ( see @xcite for a derivation in the case of the so - called model a @xcite ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the critical autocorrelation exponent @xcite , related to the initial - slip critical exponent @xmath124 @xcite by @xmath125 .     of the two - dimensional ising model , against time ratio @xmath62 , for several values of the waiting time  @xmath0 .",
    "data are multiplied by @xmath126 , in order to demonstrate collapse into the scaling function @xmath127 of eq .",
    "( [ cts_crit ] ) .",

    ", the response function behaves as @xmath131 and , for large temporal separations , @xmath132 ( see @xcite for a derivation of ( [ rts_crit ] ) and ( [ fr_crit ] ) in the case of model a. ) note the similarity of ( [ rts_crit ] ) and ( [ fr_crit ] ) with ( [ rts_coars ] ) and ( [ fr_coars ] ) , respectively .",
    "the scaling form ( [ rts_crit ] ) of the response implies @xmath133 with , as @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "we finally obtain the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath136 and , at large temporal separations , @xmath137 the last equality is equivalent to saying that , for @xmath69 , @xmath138 the limit fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath139 can thus be measured as the slope near the origin of the @xmath140 plot .",
    "the scaling function @xmath141 , and in particular the amplitude ratio @xmath142 , are universal , in the sense that they neither depend on initial conditions nor on the details of the dynamics @xcite .    in the scaling regime , neither @xmath143 nor @xmath31 are functions of @xmath83 . instead , @xmath31 and @xmath144 are functions of @xmath62 , which is in contrast with the situations where equation ( [ xc ] ) holds , and further described in section 1 .",
    "we now illustrate the results presented above . for the spherical model ( see the table for the value of exponents ) , the two - time correlation function reads @xmath145 where @xmath146 thus @xmath147 similarly , the response function behaves as @xmath148 where the scaling function @xmath149 reads @xmath150 finally @xmath151     of the two - dimensional ising model , against time ratio @xmath62 , for several values of the waiting time  @xmath0 .",

    "( after ref . @xcite . ) ]    for the 2d ising model @xmath153 @xcite is only known numerically .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show numerical determinations of the scaling functions @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xcite . in two dimensions , we have @xmath156 , and a preliminary study leads to @xmath157 in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the above discussion can be summarised as follows :    @xmath158 for short times ( @xmath64 ) , such that @xmath159 , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds , and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath158 for long times ( @xmath96 ) , such that @xmath160 , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem does not hold .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath31 is given by the scaling function @xmath161 , such that @xmath162 as @xmath163 .",
    "this is the critical counterpart of the behaviour of @xmath164 for @xmath54 , summarised at the end of section 2 .",
    "a last comment is in order . at thermal equilibrium , for a ferromagnetic system at criticality",
    ", the relationship between magnetic field and magnetisation , @xmath165 , is nonlinear .",
    "therefore linear - response theory , used above to extract the response of the system , only holds for a magnetic field small compared to the scale @xmath166 .",
    "the one - dimensional ising model is special in the sense that its critical temperature @xmath28 is zero .",
    "hence the low - temperature phase does not exist .",
    "another peculiarity of the model stems from the fact that the magnetisation exponent @xmath168 is equal to zero . as a consequence , at criticality ( i.e. , at @xmath167 )",
    ", there is no temporal prefactor in the expression of @xmath83 ( or equivalently , no spatial prefactor in that of @xmath169 ) .",
    "indeed , let us recall that , at criticality , for a generic ferromagnetic model , we had @xmath170 for the 1d ising model at zero temperature we have @xmath171 the latter formulas are compatible with the former ones , taking into account that @xmath172 for the 1d ising model",
    ". otherwise stated , the absence of an anomalous dimension implies that @xmath83 is not small in the critical region , in contrast to the generic cases considered in the previous section .    from ( [ cts_is1d ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath173    the critical temperature @xmath28 being equal to zero , we define the dimensionless response function @xmath174 in the scaling region ( @xmath33 ) , this function is found to behave as @xmath175 where @xmath176 this again is compatible with the generic case , with @xmath172 .",
    "the reduced magnetisation @xmath177 and the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath31 can be computed explicitly .",
    "both quantities only depend on @xmath81 , or equivalently on @xmath23 , in the scaling regime .",
    "one finds , in this regime @xcite , @xmath178 while @xmath179 is more simply written in terms of the ratio @xmath62 as @xmath180 we note once again that the fact that @xmath172 implies no dependence in @xmath0 in these quantities .",
    "finally , the last equation implies for the limiting ratio @xmath181",
    "at criticality , for the generic cases of the spherical model and of the 2d ising model , @xmath31 is not a function of @xmath83 .",
    "it is instead a function of the ratio @xmath62 , or equivalently of @xmath182 . in this last representation , the value of @xmath179 at the origin is equal to @xmath142",
    ". then the fluctuation - dissipation ratio increases and reaches the limit value 1 when the abscissa @xmath127 goes to infinity , that is , for @xmath183 , where the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds .",
    "is the amplitude ratio @xmath142 related to equilibrium quantities ? this remains an interesting open question .",
    "more generally , do the above results on the fluctuation - dissipation ratio admit a static interpretation , e.g. in terms of the distribution of overlaps @xmath100 @xcite ? strictly speaking , the existence of a non - trivial @xmath142 should imply the presence of an unexpected discrete component in @xmath100 .",
    "we mention a recent work on related matters @xcite , where the finite - size behaviour of @xmath100 for the 2d x - y model is related to the finite - time behaviour of @xmath184 .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite , based on conformal invariance , predicts the following form of the response function @xmath185 without predicting the values of exponents appearing in the right side .",
    "this prediction should hold for a large class of systems .",
    "we note in particular that , for the spherical model , equations ( [ rts_coars ] ) and ( [ rts_crit ] ) , together with the explicit forms of the scaling functions @xmath149 , given in sections 2 and 3 , confirm this prediction , which is also verified by numerical computations on the ising model in two and three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the analytical results for the 1d ising model given in section 4 do not , however , satisfy the prediction ( [ malte ] ) .",
    "finally it is worth adding a few words on the comparison between the results reviewed here and those reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite for urn models . for the zeta urn model ,",
    "the situation at criticality is in all aspects similar to that of a generic ferromagnetic model , as described in section 3 .",
    "however the prediction ( [ malte ] ) is not fulfilled by this model . in the low - temperature phase , the results obtained for the zeta urn model do not fall in the framework reviewed in section 2 , valid for a coarsening system . finally , the results obtained for the backgammon model at @xmath167 are rather different from the generic behaviour of a ferromagnetic model . a natural explanation of the discrepancy between urn models and ferromagnetic models is that in the former case the system is rather subject to condensation than to coarsening .    .",
