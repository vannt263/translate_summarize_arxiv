    "an important diagnostic of the physical state of the interstellar medium is its large - scale velocity dispersion .",
    "this parameter is however very difficult to derive , since it is in general dominated by the contribution of the systematic velocity gradients in the beam , which are not well - known .",
    "exactly face - on galaxies are ideal objects for this study , since the line - width can be attributed almost entirely to the z - velocity dispersion @xmath0 . indeed",
    ", the systematic gradients perpendicular to the plane are expected negligible ; for instance no systematic pattern associated to spiral arms have been observed in face - on galaxies ( e.g. shostak & van der kruit 1984 , dickey et al 1990 ) , implying that the z - streaming motions at the arm crossing are not predominant . in an inclined galaxy on the contrary",
    ", it is very difficult to obtain the true velocity dispersion , since the systematic motions in the plane @xmath1 ( rotation , arm streaming motions ) widen the spectra due to the finite spatial resolution of the observations ( e.g. garcia - burillo et al 1993 , vogel et al 1994 ) .",
    "nearly face - on galaxies have already been extensively studied in the atomic gas component , in order to derive the true hi  velocity dispersion ( van der kruit & shostak 1982 , 1984 , shostak & van der kruit 1984 , dickey et al 1990 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 as a function of radius was derived : the velocity dispersion is remarkably constant all over the galaxy @xmath0 = 6 = @xmath2 , and only in the inner parts it increases up to 12 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath0 in the plane , and in particular in the outer parts of the galaxy disk , is not yet well understood ; it might be related to the large - scale gas stability and to the linear flaring of the plane , as is observed in the milky - way ( merrifield 1992 ) and m31 ( brinks & burton 1984 ) . in the isothermal sheet model of a thin plane , where the z - velocity dispersion @xmath3 is independent of z , the height @xmath4(r ) of the gaseous plane , if assumed self - gravitating , is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gas velocity dispersion , and @xmath7 the gas surface density .",
    "the density profile is then a sech@xmath8 law . but to have the gas self - gravitating , we have to assume that either there is no dark matter component , or the gas is the dark matter itself ( e.g. pfenniger et al 1994 ) .",
    "since in general the hi  surface density decreases as 1/r in the outer parts of galaxies ( e.g. bosma 1981 ) , a linear flaring ( @xmath9 ) corresponds to a constant velocity dispersion with radius .    on the contrary hypothesis of the gas plane embedded in an external potential of larger scale height , where the gravitational acceleration close to the plane can be approximated by @xmath10 ,",
    "the z - density profile is then a gaussian : @xmath11 and the characteristic height , or gaussian scale height of the gas is : @xmath12 and @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the density in the plane of the total matter , stellar component plus dark matter component , in which the gas is embedded .",
    "if the dark component is assumed spherical , the density in the plane is dominated by the stellar component , which is distributed in an exponential disk .",
    "this hypothesis would predict an exponential flare in the gas , while the gas flares appear more linear than exponential ( e.g. merrifield 1992 , brinks & burton 1983 ) .",
    "the knowledge of their true shape is however hampered by the presence of warps . also , the flattening of the dark matter component , and its participation to the density @xmath16 in the plane , is unknown .    as for the stability arguments ,",
    "let us assume here the z - velocity dispersion comparable to the radial velocity dispersion , or at least their ratio constant with radius .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas component is self - regulated by dynamical instabilities .",
    "if the toomre q parameter for the gas @xmath17 is lower than 1 , instabilities set in , heat the medium and increase @xmath18 until @xmath19 is 1 .",
    "the critical velocity dispersion @xmath20 depends on the epicyclic frequency @xmath21 and on the gas surface density @xmath7 ; assuming again an hi  surface density decreasing as 1/r in the outer parts and a flat rotation curve , where @xmath21 also varies as 1/r , then @xmath20 is constant . to maintain @xmath22 all over the outer parts ,",
    "@xmath6 should also remain constant .",
    "however , the gas density gradient appears often steeper than @xmath23 and the @xmath19 parameter is increasing towards the outer parts .",
    "this has been noticed by kennicutt ( 1989 ) , who concluded that there exists some radius in every galaxy where the gas density reaches the threshold of global instability ( @xmath24 ) ; he identifies this radius to the onset of star formation in the disk .",
    "in fact , this threshold does not occur exactly at @xmath19 = 1 , but at a slightly higher value , around 1.4 , which could be due to the fact that the @xmath25 criterion is a single - fluid one , which does not take into account the coupling between gas and stars .",
    "the determination of the z - velocity dispersion in the molecular component has not yet been done .",
    "it could bring complementary insight to the hi  results , since in general the center of galaxies is much better sampled through co emission ( a central hi  depletion is frequent ) , and also the thickness of the h@xmath26 plane can be lower by a factor 3 or 4 than the hi  layer ( case of mw , m31 , boulanger et al 1981 ) . in the case of m51 ,",
    "an almost face - on galaxy ( i=20@xmath27 ) , the estimated @xmath0 determined from the co lines is surprisingly large ( up to @xmath0 = 25 in the southern arm ) once the rotation field , and even streaming - motions are taken into account , at the beam scale .",
    "an interpretation could be that the co lines are broadened by macroscopic opacity , i.e. cloud overlapping ( garcia - burillo et al 1993 ) , since such large line - widths are not observed in galaxies with less co emission .",
    "however , one could also suspect turbulent motions , generated at large - scale by gravitational instabilities or viscous shear .",
    "the level of star formation could be another factor : as for turbulence , it generally affects the molecular component more than the hi , except for very violent events like sne .",
    "but the finite inclination ( 20@xmath27 ) of m51 makes the discrimination between in - plane and z - dispersion very delicate .",
    "it is therefore necessary to investigate in more details this problem in exactly face - on galaxies , and determine whether there exist spatial variations of @xmath0 over the galaxy plane .    in this paper",
    "we report molecular gas observations of two face - on galaxies ngc 628 ( m74 ) and ngc 3938 , in the co(1 - 0 ) , co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath28co lines , using the iram 30m telescope . after a brief description of the galaxy parameters in section 2 , and the observational parameters in section 3",
    ", we derive the amplitude and the spatial variations of @xmath0 perpendicular to the plane in ngc 628 and ngc 3938 .",
    "section 5 summarises and discusses the physical interpretations .        from these mass models , we have derived the epicyclic frequency as a function of radius ( this does not depend on the precise model used , as long as the rotation curve is fitted ) , and the critical velocity dispersion required for axisymmetric stability , for the stellar and gaseous components ( figures [ vrot628 ] and [ vrot3938 ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the observed vertical velocity dispersions for hi  and co is clear : the observed values are most of the time larger , in particular for ngc 3938 .",
    "this means that , if the gas velocity dispersion can be considered isotropic , the toomre stability parameter in the galaxy plane is always @xmath31 , and most of the time @xmath32 2 - 3 , for ngc 3938 . for ngc 628 , @xmath19 is near 1 between 3 and 20kpc , and the threshold for star formation , @xmath33 according to kennicutt ( 1989 ) is reached at 23 kpc .",
    "this is far in the outer parts of the galaxy , since r@xmath30 = 15.5 kpc .    if the vertical dispersion is lower than in the plane , as could be the case ( e.g. olling 1995 ) , than @xmath19 is even larger .",
    "the gas appears then to be quite stable , unless the coupling gas - stars has a very large effect .",
    "figures [ vrot628 ] and [ vrot3938 ] also plot the critical velocity dispersion for the stellar component , together with a fit to the observed stellar velocity dispersions , from van der kruit & freeman ( 1984 ) for ngc 628 and from bottema ( 1988 , 1993 ) for ngc 3938 . from a sample of 12 galaxies where such data are available , bottema ( 1993 )",
    "concludes that the stellar velocity dispersion is declining exponentially as @xmath34 , as expected for an exponential disk of scale - length @xmath35 and constant thickness , as found by van der kruit & searle ( 1981 ) .",
    "since mostly the vertical stellar dispersion @xmath36 is measured , it is assumed that there is a constant ratio between the radial dispersion @xmath37 , comparable to that observed in the solar neighbourhood @xmath38 = 0.6 .",
    "this is already well above the minimum ratio required for vertical stability , i.e. @xmath38 = 0.3 ( araki 1985 , merritt & sellwood 1994 ) . within these assumptions",
    ", it can be derived that the toomre parameter for the stars @xmath39 is about constant with radius , within the optical disk ; it depends of course on the mass - to - light ratio adopted for the luminous component , and is in the range @xmath40 1 for m(stars)/l@xmath41 = 3 .",
    "figures [ vrot628 ] and [ vrot3938 ] confirm the result of almost constant @xmath39 , but with low values , especially for ngc 3938 .",
    "this could be explained , if the vertical dispersion is indeed much lower than the radial one .",
    "the minimum value for the ratio @xmath38 is 0.3 ( for stability reasons ) , so that the derived @xmath39 values displayed in figures [ vrot628 ] and [ vrot3938 ] could be multiplied by @xmath42 2 .",
    "the idea of stellar velocity dispersion regulated by gravitational instabilities appears therefore supported by the data , within the uncertainties .",
    "the most intriguing result is the large gas vertical dispersion observed for ngc 3938 , and its distribution with radius .",
    "the large corresponding @xmath19 values , that will mean comfortable stability , are difficult to reconcile with the observed large and small - scales gas instabilities : clear spiral arms are usually observed in the outer hi  disks , with small - scale structure as well ( see e.g. van der hulst & sancisi 1988 , richter & sancisi 1994 ) .",
    "this is also the case here for ngc 628 showing all signs of gravitational instabilities in its outer hi  disk ( kamphuis & briggs 1992 ) , and for ngc 3938 ( van der kruit & shostak 1982 ) .",
    "a possibility to reduce @xmath19 is that also the gas dispersion is anisotropic , this time the vertical one being larger than in the plane .",
    "however we will see , through comparison with gas dispersion in the plane of the galaxy ( cf next section ) that the anisotropy of gas dispersion does not appear so large .",
    "another explanation could be that the present rough calculations of the @xmath25-parameter concern only a simplified one - component stability analysis , and could be significantly modified by multi - components analysis .",
    "it has been shown ( jog & solomon 1984 , romeo 1992 , jog 1992 & 1996 ) that the coupling between several components de - stabilises every dynamical component .",
    "the apparent stability ( @xmath43 ) of the gas component might therefore not be incompatible with an instability - regulated velocity dispersion for the gas .",
    "but then , in the vertical direction , the dispersion is much higher than the minimum required for vertical stability .",
    "could this large velocity dispersion be powered by star formation ?",
    "this is not likely , at least for the majority of the hi  gas well outside the optical disk , where no stellar activity is observed .",
    "a possible explanation would be to suppose that the hi  is tracing a much larger amount of gas , in the form of molecular clouds , which will then be self - gravitating , with @xmath44 ( pfenniger et al 1994 ; pfenniger & combes 1994 ) . with a flat rotation curve , and a gas surface density decreasing as @xmath23 , the critical dispersion",
    "would then be constant with radius .",
    "another puzzle is the similarity of the co and hi  vertical velocity dispersions .",
    "if the gas layers are indeed isothermal in z , we can deduce that both atomic and molecular layers have also similar heights .",
    "this means that the atomic and molecular components can be considered as a unique dynamical component , which can be observed under two phases , according to the local physical conditions ( density , excitation temperature , etc .. ) .",
    "the amplitudes of z - oscillations of the molecular and atomic gas are the same , only we see the gas as molecular when it is at heights lower than @xmath42 50pc . at these heights ,",
    "the molecular fraction is @xmath45 ( imamura & sofue 1997 ) , which means that almost all clouds are molecular , taking into account their atomic envelope .",
    "in fact it is not clear whether we see the co or h@xmath26 formation and destruction , since we can rely only on the co tracer . also , it is possible that the density of clouds at high altitude is not enough to excite the co molecule , which means that the limit for observing co will not be coinciding with the limit for molecular presence itself .",
    "the latter is strongly suggested by the observed vertical density profiles of the h@xmath26 and hi  number density : there is a sharp boundary where the apparent @xmath46 falls to zero , while we expect a smoother profile for a unique dynamical gas component .",
    "that the gas can change phase from molecular to atomic and vice - versa several times in one z - oscillation is not unexpected , since the time - scale of molecular formation and destruction is smaller than the z - oscillation period , of @xmath42 10@xmath47 yrs at the optical radius : the chemical time - scale is of the order of 10@xmath48 yrs ( leung et al 1984 , langer & graedel 1989 ) .",
    "morever , as discussed in the previous section ( _ 5.1 _ ) , the key factor controlling the presence of molecules is photodestruction , which explains why there is a column density threshold above which the gas phase turns to molecular ( elmegreen 1993 )",
    ". this threshold could be reached at some particular height above the plane .",
    "should we expect the existence of several layers of gas at different tmperatures , and therefore different thicknesses , in galaxy planes ? in the very simple model of a diffuse and homogeneous gas , unperturbed by star - formation , we can compute the mixing time - scale of two layers at different temperatures , through atomic or molecule collisions : this is of the order of the collisional time - scale , @xmath42 10@xmath49 yrs for an average volumic density of 1 @xmath50 , and a thermal velocity of 0.3 .",
    "this is very short with respect to the z - oscillation time scale of @xmath42 10@xmath47 yrs , and therefore mixing should occur , if differential dissipation or gravitational heating is not taken into account .",
    "this simple model is of course very far from realistic .",
    "we know that the interstellar medium , atomic as well as molecular , is distributed in a hierachical ensemble of clouds , similar to a fractal .",
    "let us then consider another simple modelisation of an ideal gas where the particles are in fact the interstellar clouds , undergoing collisions ( cf oort 1954 , cowie 1980 ) . for typical clouds of 1pc size , and 10@xmath51 @xmath50 volumic density , the collisional time - scale is of the order of 10@xmath47 yrs , comparable with the vertical oscillations time - scale .",
    "this figure should not be taken too seriously , given the rough simplifications , but it corresponds to what has been known for a long time , i.e. the ensemble of clouds can not be considered as a fluid in equilibrium , since the collisional time - scale is comparable to the dynamical time , like the spiral - arm crossing time ( cf bash 1979 , kwan 1979 , casoli & combes 1982 , combes & gerin 1985 ) .",
    "if the collisions were able to redistribute the kinetic energy completely , there should be equipartition , i.e. the velocity dispersion would decrease with the mass @xmath52 of the clouds like @xmath53 .",
    "in fact the cloud - cloud relative velocities are roughly constant with mass ( between clouds of masses 100 m@xmath54 and gmcs of 10@xmath55 m@xmath54 , a ratio of 100 would be expected in velocity dispersions , which is not observed , stark 1979 ) . towards the galactic anticenter , where streaming motions should be minimised , the one - dimensional dispersion for the low - mass and giant clouds",
    "are found to be about 9.1 and 6.6 respectively , with near constancy over several orders of magnitude , and therefore no equipartition of energy ( stark 1984 ) .",
    "the almost constancy of velocity dispersions with mass requires to find other mechanisms responsible for the heating .",
    "if relatively small clouds can be heated by star - formation , supernovae , etc ... (e.g .",
    "chize & lazareff 1980 ) , the largest clouds could be heated by gravitational scattering ( jog & ostriker 1988 , gammie et al 1991 ) . in the latter mechanism ,",
    "encounters between clouds with impact parameters of the order of their tidal radius in a differentially rotating disk are equivalent to a gravitational viscosity that pumps the rotational energy into random cloud kinetic energy . a 1d velocity dispersion of 5 - 7is the predicted result , independent of mass .",
    "this value is still slightly lower than the observed 1d dispersion of clouds observed in the milky way .",
    "stark & brand ( 1989 ) find 7.8from a study within 3 kpc of the sun .",
    "but collective effects , gravitational instabilities forming structures like spiral arms , etc ... have not yet been taken into account .",
    "given the high degree of structure and apparent permanent instability of the gas , they must play a major role in the heating , the source of energy being also the global rotational energy .",
    "dissipation lowering the gas dispersion continuously maintains the gas at the limit of instability , closing the feedback loop of the self - regulation ( lin & pringle 1987 , bertin & romeo 1988 ) . in the external parts of galaxies , where there is no star formation , gravitational instabilities are certainly the essential heating mechanism",
    "this again will tend to an isothermal , or more exactly isovelocity , ensemble of clouds , since the gravitational mechanism does not depend on the particle mass .",
    "the molecular or atomic gas are equivalent in this process , and should reach the same equilibrium dispersion .      in the milky way , although the kinematics of gas is much complicated due to our embedded perspective , we have also the same puzzle . the velocity dispersion has been estimated through several methods , with intrinsic biases for each method , but essentially the dispersion has been estimated in the plane . only with high - latitude molecular clouds",
    ", can we have an idea of the local vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "magnani et al ( 1996 ) have recently made a compilation of more than 100 of these high - latitude clouds .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the ensemble is 5.8if seven intermediate velocity objects are excluded , and 9.9 otherwise .",
    "this is interestingly close to the values we find for ngc 628 ( 6 ) and ngc 3938 ( 8.5 ) .",
    "unfortunately there is always some doubt in the galaxy that all molecular clouds are taken into account , due to many selection effects , while the measurement is much more direct at large scale in external face - on galaxies .",
    "in fact , it has been noticed by magnani et al ( 1996 ) that there were an inconsistency between the local measured scale - height of molecular clouds ( about 60pc ) and the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "however , they conclude in terms of a different population for the local high - latitude clouds ( hlc ) .",
    "indeed , the total mass of observed hlc is still a small fraction of the molecular surface density at the solar radius .",
    "the local gaussian scale height of the molecular component has been derived to be 58pc ( at r@xmath54 = 8.5kpc ) through a detailed data modelling by malhotra ( 1994 ) ; this is also compatible with all previous values ( dame et al 1987 , clemens et al 1988 ) .",
    "the local hi  scale height is 220pc ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "we therefore would have expected a ratio of 3.8 between the dispersions of the h@xmath26 and hi  gas , but these are very similar , within the uncertainties , which come mainly from the clumpiness of the clouds for the h@xmath26 component .",
    "if we believe the more easily determined hi  dispersion of 9(malhotra 1995 ) , then the h@xmath26 dispersion is expected to be 2.4 , clearly outside of the error bars or intrinsic scatter : the value at the solar radius is estimated at 7.8by malhotra ( 1994 ) .",
    "of course , all this discussion is hampered by the fact that we discuss mainly horizontal dispersions in the case of the milky way , while the gas dispersions could well be anisotropic .",
    "this is why the present results on external face - on galaxies are more promising .",
    "the vertical gas velocity dispersion in spiral galaxies is an important parameter required to determine the flattening of the dark matter component , combined with the observation of the gas layer thickness ( cf olling 1995 , becquaert & combes 1997 ) .",
    "we have shown here that the gas dispersion does not appear very anisotropic , in the sense that the vertical dispersion is not much smaller that what has been derived in the plane of our galaxy ( for instance by the terminal velocity method , burton 1992 , malhotra 1994 ) .",
    "such vertical dispersion data should be obtained in much larger samples , to consolidate statistically this result .",

    "<S> the contribution of the beam - smeared in - plane velocity gradients to the observed velocity width is quite small in the outer parts of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to derive the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas perpendicular to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this dispersion is remarkably constant with radius , 6 for ngc 628 and 8.5 for ngc 3938 , and of the same order as the hi  dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the constancy of the value is interpreted in terms of a feedback mechanism involving gravitational instabilities and gas dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the co and hi  dispersions suggests that the two components are well mixed , and are only two different phases of the same kinematical gas component . </S>",
    "<S> the gas can be transformed from the atomic phase to the molecular phase and vice - versa several times during a z - oscillation .    </S>",
