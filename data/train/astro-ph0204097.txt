( 1999 ) compared observed modes for @xmath0 scuti stars in the praesepe cluster with unstable modes as obtained from a linear stability analysis including a nonlocal time - dependent treatment of convection . in the present paper , we extend this work to the pleiades cluster , updating several aspects of the procedure . following soufi et al .",

    "observational data for the @xmath0 scuti stars used in this work are summarized in table1 .",
    "all data and references can be found in fox et al .",
    "( 2001 and these proceedings ) .",
    "the evolution models for the pleiades cluster have been computed ( for a metallicity of z=0.014 ) using the evolution code cesam ( morel , 1997 ) .",
    "we used opal opacity tables ( iglesias & rogers , 1996 ) and the atmosphere is computed using the eddington s @xmath8 law .",
    "models with @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be called standard ( std ) , @xmath11- and @xmath12-models respectively . @xmath12 and @xmath11 are the overshooting and the mixing - length parameters respectively .",
    "an age of @xmath13myr is found to be representative of this cluster .",
    "since we work with fast rotators , a correction for the effect of rotation on the photomotric parameters is required ( michel et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "following prez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we apply such a correction for the selected objects ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the correction gives us access to an estimation of masses , radii and rotation rates , parameters which are used to compute uniformly rotating models .",
    "rotating evolution models are used to compute adiabatic oscillation eigenfrequencies . following soufi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we improve the method used in michel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to obtain these eigenfrequencies .",
    "the objective of such calculations is to determine a possible range of radial orders associated with the observed modes given in ( table1 ) .    on the other hand , in order to calculate linear growth rates , we use stability computations which are carried out in the manner described by houdek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . to do so ,",
    "we compute envelope models fitted to our evolution models by outer convection zone dephts , masses , radii and effective temperatures .",
    "the fundamental parameters obtained in sect.2.1 are not sensitive to realistic changes in age , @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters , as can be expected for such a young cluster .",
    "thus , envelope models are computed for a unique set of parameters .",
    "the instability computation results will be sensitive to changes in @xmath14 only through the fine description of the outer convective regions .",
    "they will not be affected by @xmath12 variations , making useless the study of this parameter here . in this context ,",
    "such clusters represent a good opportunity to test the convection in the outer convective zone , since they are free of uncertainties in the overshooting description .    cccc + star & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 +   + & [ 1 , 7 - 8 ] & [ 5 , 7 - 8 ] & @xmath18 + & [ 1 , 7 - 8 ] & [ 5 , 7 - 8 ] & @xmath18 + & [ 1 , 7 - 8 ] & [ 1 , 6 - 7 ] & @xmath19 + & [ 1 , 7 - 8 ] & [ 1 , 6 - 7 ] & @xmath19 +    the predicted ranges of radial orders and those derived from observations are given in table2 for _ std _ and _ @xmath11_-models .",
    "contrary to the praesepe results , a unique range of radial orders , including the fundamental , is obtained for the different masses . in the case of praesepe , a good agreement between the predicted ranges and those derived from observations was found for the high - mass and `` low - mass '' to @xmath20 . ]",
    "stars independently of the @xmath14 values . for low - mass stars , it was possible to reach an agreement for given @xmath14 values . here , for the low - mass stars ,",
    "a good agreement is found , also independently of @xmath14 , however , no matching is possible for high - mass stars and realistic @xmath14 values .    as in michel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the previous discussion is limited to the results obtained for instability computations using fundamental parameters of non - rotating models .",
    "for the four @xmath0 scuti stars of the pleiades we have also computed rotating models , which present outer convective zones significantly deeper than the non - rotating models .",
    "therefore , for these non - rotating models it is not possible to build consistent envelope models using the set of parameters described in section2.2 without introducing , somehow , the effect of the centrifugal force .",
    "for selected @xmath0 scuti stars in the pleiades , we report here the results of a comparison between frequency ranges of unstable modes , predicted from instability computations , with observed ones .",
    "significant differences are found with respect to results obtained for praesepe ( michel et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we find evidence suggesting that these results might be significantly changed when including some effects of rotation in the stability computations .",
    "taking advantage of the updated procedure presented in this paper , an homogeneous simultaneous study of the pleiades and praesepe is planned .",
    "this will give us the possibility of determine whether we can obtain consistent results and how they can constraint the description of the convective transport in the outer convective zones .",
