    "the gutzwiller state for a lattice of @xmath5 sites is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metallic fermi state constructed from the vacuum state by using electron creation operators @xmath8 with a momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 , and @xmath0 is a parameter taking values from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the non - interacting case , and @xmath14 being the limit of infinite interactions .",
    "the filling factor is determined by @xmath15,the fermi momentum .    while the gutzwiller state gives good agreement with hubbard model ground state for three dimensions , in 1d , it is different from the ground state of the hubbard model . at half - filling ,",

    "thus the rank of the reduced density matrix is vastly reduced . since on - site",
    "correlation factor @xmath0 reduces the probability of doubly - occupied sites , the rank is reduced as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "reduction of the rank of the reduced density matrix is one of the reasons for a decrease of the entanglement as @xmath34 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue is an important parameter governing the distribution of eigenvalues .",
    "the range of the distribution of eigenvalues @xmath35 is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath32 . for gutzwiller state at half - filling , @xmath32 decreases as correlation factor @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is because , as the rank of the reduced density matrix increases , the normalisation factor demands a decrease of @xmath32 .    for a given rank @xmath4 ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath32 is @xmath36 , which corresponds to the maximally entangled state where all eigenvalues are equal .",
    "thus minimum value of the product @xmath37 is @xmath12 .",

    "this means that the state is always far from the maximally entangled state .",
    "but the strongly interacting case is closer to the maximally entangled state of the corresponding rank , than the metallic state , even though the metallic state has greater entanglement entropy ( see introduction , eq [ ee ] ) due to its greater rank .",
    "the onset of the crossover to metallic region is seen by the product becoming almost constant .",
    "the crossover region shown by this curve matches with that from the scaling form for the entanglement entropy@xcite .",

    "a hamiltonian describing a chaotic system is one which can be modelled by a random matrix ensemble with the same degree of freedom as the hamiltonian , viz .",
    "both have the same spacing distribution given by the wigner surmise ( the goe , gue or gse spacing distribution ) @xcite .",
    "the wigner surmise gives a zero at zero spacing , which means there can be no degeneracy of eigenvalues .",
    "for an integrable system , however , the spacing distribution is given by a poisson distribution , which has a peak at zero spacing , which means a large number of eigenvalues are degenerate .",
    "if we have an integrable system and then introduce a symmetry breaking perturbation via a control parameter that makes it non - integrable , it has been recently shown @xcite that the spacing distribution changes from poisson to the wigner surmise . therefore , the fraction of distinct eigenvalues changes from less than one to one as the symmetry - breaking parameter is increased and then remains constant at one .",
    "thus , the fraction of distinct eigenvalues remaining constant as the symmetry - breaking parameter is changed can be taken as a signature of quantum chaos .    instead of the hamiltonian",
    ", here we are concerned with the reduced density matrix of bipartition of the gutzwiller state , but , we have a similar situation . for @xmath14 and @xmath13 , because of scale invariance , the system is amenable to analytical methods via cft , and thus is ` integrable ' , whereas for intermediate values of @xmath0 , scale invariance is broken and it becomes ` non - integrable ' .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 therefore acts like the symmetry - breaking parameter .",
    "fig [ fig : n / r ] shows the variation of the fraction of distinct eigenvalues with @xmath0 for the reduced density matrix of half - filled gutzwiller state .",
    "we see that for intermediate values of @xmath0 , the fraction of distinct eigenvalues remain almost constant .",
    "this then may be a signature of quantum chaos .",
    "however , this constant is much smaller than one .",
    "this is because , even though scale invariance is broken , the symmetries and the block diagonal nature of the reduced density matrix preserves a lot of degeneracy of the eigenvalues . that this is indeed a signature of quantum chaos",
    "will be made clear from the detailed analysis of the spacing distribution ( section [ spacing distribution ] . ) .",
    "the detailed description of the various symmetries of the reduced density matrix will also be given while studying the spacing distribution .",
    "near @xmath13 , the fraction of distinct eigenvalues decreases from the constant value because degeneracy increases , while the rank remains nearly the same . on the other hand , near @xmath14 , the fraction of distinct eigenvalues increases from the constant value because of a drastic decrease in rank .",
    "next we look at the density distribution of non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the block entanglement entropy can be written , using the density of eigenvalues , as    @xmath40    here , the integrated density of eigenvalues @xmath41 is given by @xmath42    calabrese and lefevre@xcite calculated this function for one - dimensional gapless systems using cft .",

    "various authors have shown @xcite : @xmath49 in the large @xmath45 limit .",
    "also , following cardy and calabrese @xcite , entanglement entropy is given by : @xmath50 which is also true in the large @xmath45 limit .",
    "above statement is just restatement of the result that entanglement entropy equals the single - copy entanglement in the large @xmath45 limit .    in fig.[fig :",
    "n(e)1](@xmath51 ) , the integrated eigenvalue density @xmath52 is plotted as a function of @xmath53 for @xmath30 sites for various values of on - site correlation factor @xmath0 , along with the corresponding plots of the cft result given above .",
    "the cft result is seen to be correct only when @xmath14 and @xmath13 and not for intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "this , of course , as described in introduction , is not surprising in light of previous work @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that cft results are valid only at the two end points .",
    "the reason is that it is only at the two end points that all underlying correlation lengths are infinite . for intermediate values of @xmath0",
    ", there is a finite correlation length that comes from correlation between opposite spins .",
    "hence the system does not remain scale invariant and finite - size corrections become important .",
    "deviations from cft result signifies the crossover . however , the entanglement entropy retains cft - like scaling only with a different effective central charge which includes finite - size corrections .",
    "so , we expect that upon replacing the central charge in above equations by the effective central charge will give the correct @xmath52 for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , we can just go back to the result @xmath54 .",
    "so , the formula for integrated eigenvalue spectrum becomes : @xmath55 where the modulus is inserted because the term inside is no longer guaranteed to be positive .",

    "@xmath57 is block diagonal , with each block specified by the number of up spins @xmath58 and the number of down spins @xmath59 in @xmath60 .",

    "also , all the eigenvalues from blocks with @xmath64 particles in @xmath60 are same as those from blocks with @xmath65 particles in @xmath60 .",

    "the sum is over all possible configurations of @xmath63 , i.e , all possible choices of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "writing out the slater determinants explicitly and simplifying , it can be shown that there are some terms in the sum that are independent of the configurations of @xmath63 . upon performing the sum over configurations of @xmath63 , these terms",
    "add up coherently whereas the other terms add incoherently .",
    "since the number of all possible configurations of @xmath63 is quite large , we can approximate @xmath68 by considering only the terms independent of configurations of @xmath63 .",

    "thus the @xmath87 is real . also due to the same reason ,",
    "@xmath87 depends only on the relative positions of up ( down ) spins in the @xmath51th and @xmath72th configurations .",

    "hence the correlation matrix has a real symmetric toeplitz structure .",
    "therefore , each block of @xmath57 , which is proportional to the matrix @xmath89 , must have the same number of degrees of freedom as a real symmetric toeplitz matrix .",
    "motivated by random matrix theory and the fact that the system behaves ` chaotic ' for intermediate values of @xmath0 , we claim that the adjacent level spacing distribution for intermediate values of @xmath0 will be the same as that of a random matrix ensemble of block diagonal matrices where each block is a real symmetric toeplitz matrix whose elements are drawn from some distribution with mean @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 .",
    "ensemble of random real symmetric toeplitz matrices have been previously investigated and the spacing distribution is found to be poisson distribution , and not the usual goe spacing distribution @xcite .",
    "this is because the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath105 real symmetric toeplitz matrix is @xmath106 and not @xmath107 . in our case , since sizes of blocks vary , we have many ensembles of random real symmetric toeplitz matrices of various sizes .",
    "so the spacing distribution will not exactly be the poisson distribution . since size of matrix is the only parameter in a random matrix ensemble , blocks of same size will have same distribution of eigenvalues",
    ". also eigenvalue distributions of blocks of different sizes will overlap .",
    "hence , probability of degeneracy of the eigenvalues will be very high .",
    "thus in the spacing distribution , there will be a pronounced peak at zero spacing .",
    "apart from the peak , the effect of having blocks of various sizes will be to slow down the poisson like decay .",
    "so the exponent in poisson distribution will pick up a constant factor .",
    "the amplitude of the poisson like decay function will be much smaller than the peak at zero spacing .",
    "thus the spacing distribution we expect from random matrix theory is highly peaked at zero and having an exponentially decaying tail , the peak being much higher than amplitude of the exponential function .",

    "we need to unfold the eigenvalue spectrum to get a non - trivial distribution , viz .",
    "the average spacing of the unfolded energy level should be independent of the system size .",

    "<S> the fraction of distinct eigenvalues exhibits a ` chaotic ' behaviour in the crossover region , and it shows a ` integrable ' behaviour at both insulating and metallic ends . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated entanglement spectrum obeys conformal field theory ( cft ) prediction at the metal and insulator ends , but shows a noticeable deviation from cft prediction in the crossover regime , thus it can also track a metal - insulator crossover . a modification of the cft result for the entanglement spectrum for finite size is proposed which holds in the crossover regime also . </S>",
    "<S> the adjacent level spacing distribution of unfolded non - zero eigenvalues for intermediate values of gutzwiller projection parameter @xmath0 is the same as that of an ensemble of random matrices obtained by replacing each block of reduced density matrix by a random real symmetric toeplitz matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is strongly peaked at zero , with an exponential tail proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the adjacent level spacing , @xmath3 is number of distinct eigenvalues and @xmath4 is the rank of the reduced density matrix . </S>",
