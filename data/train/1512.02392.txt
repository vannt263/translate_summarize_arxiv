    "about almost half a century ago , bogoliubov proposed an interesting model of baryons @xcite , which assumes that these particles are composed of independent quarks bound by a linearly raising potential , as suggested by gauge theories . with the help of a single phenomenological parameter , the string tension @xmath4 ,",
    "this model is able to qualitatively account for the dynamically generated mass of the nucleon , for the corresponding magnetic moment , and for the mass - radius .",
    "the quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) model due to guichon @xcite incorporates successfully the quark degrees of freedom into a many - body effective nuclear hamiltonian , this being achieved by describing nucleons in the context of the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present note is to obtain a phenomenological description of hadronic matter in the spirit of the qmc approach combined with the bogoliubov model for the description of the quark dynamics in the nucleon rest system .",
    "the independent quark model of the nucleon proposed by bogoliubov @xcite is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the components @xmath7 of @xmath8 are dirac matrices , @xmath9 denotes the external scalar field , @xmath10 denotes the quark-@xmath9 coupling and @xmath4 denotes the string tension .",
    "contrary to the mit bag model @xcite , in @xmath11 the confining potential for quarks is a dirac scalar .",
    "this fact motivates and justifies that the qmc approach is revisited in combination with the bogoliubov model .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are obtained by a scale transformation from the eigenvalues of @xmath12where @xmath13 is a parameter .",
    "the variational principle may be applied , to the square of @xmath11 , @xmath14 if in @xmath15 the term proportional to @xmath6 is neglected , a simplified model is obtained according to which , and by combining bogoliubov @xcite and guichon @xcite ideas , confined quarks in nuclear matter are described , in the nucleon rest frame , by an equation of the klein - gordon type , @xmath16 the mass squared of the confined quarks , @xmath17 , is the lowest eigenvalue of the simplified bogoliubov - guichon operator @xmath18 and can be easily expressed in terms the lowest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath19 the eigenvalues of ( [ 2cho ] ) coincide with the eigenvalues associated with antisymmetric eigenfunctions of the double oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath20 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) , the two lowest eigenvalues of this operator are tabulated .",
    "we are interested in the second one since it corresponds to the groundstate of @xmath21 .    of course",
    ", quarks are coupled not only with the scalar field , but also with the omega field .",
    "this coupling was not included in eq .",
    "( [ h_d ] ) because , as explained in @xcite , its only effect is the nucleon - omega coupling which will be considered in due course .    the simplified model based on eq .",
    "( [ bkg ] ) is interesting on its own right because the essential physics is already contained in it .",
    "moreover , it seems likely that bogoliubov s model originated from the consideration of the corresponding klein - gordon equation .",
    "the exact groundstate eigenvalue of @xmath21 ( eq . ( [ 2cho ] ) ) may be easily determined .",
    "for @xmath22 the relevant values in ( * ? ? ?",

    "( [ 2cho ] ) , we also consider the ansatz @xmath27where the parameter @xmath28 should be fixed variationally for each value of @xmath29 . with @xmath30 ,",
    "this ansatz had already been proposed in @xcite and is exact for @xmath31 and in the limit @xmath32      the ansatz @xmath33 provides a very good approximation to the groundstate eigenvalue of @xmath21 .",

    "( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) deserves to be stressed .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the curves displayed in figure [ fig3 ] , representing the binding energy vs. the baryon density , were obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha-00 ] ) , ( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) and ( [ m^2-alpha ] ) .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath37550 mev , @xmath38 mev and the quark mass for nucleons in vacuum , @xmath39 mev .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath40 were chosen so as to reproduce the binding energy and density at equilibrium , that is , @xmath41  mev at saturation @xmath42  @xmath43 ( pressure @xmath44 ) , being @xmath45 mev the free nucleon mass",
    ". the value of @xmath4 is determined by the quark mass in vacuum .",
    "we find that eqs .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha-00 ] ) and ( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) are associated with @xmath46 mev@xmath47 , while eq .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha ] ) is associated with @xmath48 mev@xmath47 .",
    "taking the dirac structure of the quark wave function into account , leads to an increase of the string tension . at saturation density ,",
    "the effective mass is given by @xmath49 for eq.([m^2-alpha-00 ] ) , @xmath50 for eq.([m^2-alpha - s ] ) and @xmath51 and for eq.([m^2-alpha ] ) , while the incompressibility is given by @xmath52 mev for eqs .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha-00 ] ) , by @xmath53 for ( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) and by @xmath0 mev for eq .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha ] ) .",
    "we point out that for the qmc model based on the mit bag model , the obtained incompressibility is 291 mev .",
    "the outputs are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we observe that the values we find for the incompressibility are quite close to what might be called the  empirical value \" obtained by satpathy and nayak @xcite , @xmath54 mev , however , too high for the value obtained in @xcite where the value @xmath55 mev constrained by the giant monopole resonance , is obtained .",
    "it appears that the more correct treatment of the dirac model gives too large an incompressibility .",
    "however , it is likely that , by using a more flexible variational ansatz , for instance , one with different @xmath56 s in the upper and in the lower components of the dirac wavefunction , the stiffness will be slightly reduced .",
    "@xcite is represented .",
    "different curves were obtained calculating the effective mass of the nucleon from eqs .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha-00 ] ) , ( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) and ( [ m^2-alpha ] ) . ]",
    "asymmetric nuclear matter is described by including @xmath57 meson , the @xmath57-quark coupling @xmath58 having been chosen so as to reproduce a symmetry energy of @xmath59 mev at saturation . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , the eos for asymmetric matter is represented for several proton fractions calculated with ( [ m^2-alpha ] ) .",
    "as expected , the binding energy increases with an increase of isospin asymmetry and neutron matter is not bound .",
    "next we have considered the eos of stellar matter including electrons and muons and imposing @xmath6-equilibrium and charge neutrality in order to calculate the structure of neutron stars within the present model .",
    "two solar mass pulsars have been recently confirmed , see @xcite , and acceptable models should describe stars with a mass at least as large as @xmath60 .",
    "we have integrated the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity @xcite and computed neutron star properties , namely , the maximum gravitational mass @xmath61 , the maximum baryonic mass @xmath62 and the respective radius @xmath63 , shown in table [ tab4 ] for the different approximations discussed in the previous sections . for the outer crust the baym - pethick - sutherland eos ( bps ) @xcite was used . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot the mass versus the radius of the family of stars described with the stellar matter equation of state obtained for the nucleon effective mass calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ m^2-alpha-00 ] ) , ( [ m^2-alpha - s ] ) and ( [ m^2-alpha ] ) . since the full model with the mass given by ( [ m^2-alpha ] ) gives rise to the hardest eos , it is not surprising that the full model predicts the largest masses . in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we also include the mass constraints imposed by the the pulsar psr j0348 + 0432 with a mass @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the following considerations are in order .",
    "the tendencies to chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement show up in the increasing nucleon bag size , and in the decreasing effective mass , for increasing density . indeed , eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) suggests that the nucleon bag looks like a hollow bubble , whose radius @xmath65 , ( @xmath66 ) , increases with density , becoming rather large at high densities .",
    "notice that @xmath67 . at extremely low and extremely high densities",
    ", @xmath56 becomes equal to @xmath68 . on the other hand , according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the mass decreases appreciably as the density increases .",
    "the obtained phenomenological string tension is somewhat low .",
    "this is because we have considered the oversimplification of an independent particle model , i.e. , a one - body force , to describe the three body force which represents the actual string interaction connecting each quark in the nucleon to the common center of mass .",
    "a reduction in the phenomenological string tension is the price payed for the extreme simplicity of the used model .",
    "notice that strings are one dimensional objects , and we use a three dimensional confining one - body potential to represent them .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a relativistic nuclear model that takes the quarks as fundamental constituents , and describes the nucleons as composite particles .",
    "the quarks interact in the vacuum through a linear interaction , and medium effects are taken into account through the coupling of the quarks to mesons fields .",
    "the mesonic fields are obtained through a minimization of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "the parameters of the model are chosen so that saturation nuclear matter properties are described , however , the incompressibility comes a bit too high .",
    "as soon the internuclear spacing is of the order of the radius of the nucleon a phase transition to quark matter is expected .",
    "an interesting and consistent eos embodying the hadron - quark phase transition may be obtained by describing the quark phase in the framework of bogoliubov s independent quark model .",
    "this will be considered in the near future .",
    "the effect of the temperature in the behavior of the radius will also be investigated .",
