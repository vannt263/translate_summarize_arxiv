    "the motion of a `` simple '' brownian particle is due to fluctuations of the surrounding medium , i.e. the result of random impacts of the molecules or atoms of the liquid or gas , the particle is immersed in .",
    "this type of motion would be rather considered as _ passive motion _ , simply because the brownian particle does not play an active part in this motion . on the other hand , already in physico - chemical systems a _ self - driven motion _ of particles",
    "can be found @xcite .",
    "for instance , small solid particles floating on a liquid surface may produce a chemical substance at a spatially inhomogeneous rate , which locally changes the surface tension . this way the substance induces a net capillary force acting on the particle , which results in the particle s motion .",
    "recent investigations on _ interacting _ self - driven particles show a broad variety of interesting phenomena , such as phase transitions and the emergence of self - ordered motion @xcite . here , the focus is on collective effects rather than on the origin of the particle s velocity ; i.e. it is usually postulated that the particles move with a certain non - zero velocity .    in this paper , we focus on the _ energetic _ aspects of self - driven motion in order to derive conditions for an _ active mode _ of motion . _",
    "active motion _ , as the name suggests , occurs under energy consumption , it is related to processes of energy storage and conversion into kinetic energy .",
    "for instance on the biological level , cells or simple microorganisms are capable of _ active _ , self - driven motion , which in many cases has been successfully described by stochastic equations @xcite .    in order to describe both the _ random _ aspects and the _ energetic _ aspects of active motion , we have introduced a model of _ active brownian particles _ @xcite .",
    "these are brownian particles with the ability to take up energy from the environment , to store it in an internal depot and to convert internal energy to perform different activities , such as metabolism , motion , change of the environment , or signal - response behavior .",
    "since the focus in this paper is on the energetic aspects of active brownian particles in a specific potential , possible changes of the environment are neglected here .",
    "a very simple mechanism to take - up the additional energy required for active motion , is the pumping of energy by _ space - dependent friction _ @xcite . in this case",
    ", the friction coefficient @xmath3 becomes a space - dependent function , @xmath4 , which in a certain spatial range can be also negative . inside this area the brownian particle , instead of loosing energy because of dissipative processes ,",
    "is pumped with energy , which in turn increases its velocity . provided a supercritical supply of energy ,",
    "the particle should be able to move with a velocity larger than the average thermal velocity .    while such an approach will be able to model the spatially inhomogeneous supply of energy , it has the drawback not to consider processes of storage and conversion of energy .",
    "in fact , with only a space - dependent friction , the brownian particle is instantaneously accelerated or slowed down , whereas e.g. biological systems have the capability to stretch their supply of energy over a certain time interval .    in order to develop a more realistic model of active motion ,",
    "we have considered an _ internal energy depot _ for the brownian particles @xcite , which allows to store the taken - up energy in the internal depot , from where it can be converted e.g. into kinetic energy , namely for the acceleration of motion . additionally , the internal dissipation of energy , due to storage and conversion ( or metabolism in a biological context ) can be considered .    with these extensions ,",
    "the brownian particle becomes in fact a _ brownian motor _",
    "@xcite , which is fueled somewhere and then uses the stored energy with a certain efficiency @xcite to move forward , also against external forces . provided a supercritical supply of energy , we have found that the motion of active brownian particles in the two - dimensional space can become rather complex @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the one - dimensional motion of an ensemble of brownian particles with internal energy depot in piecewise linear potentials .",
    "one particular example is the ratchet potential , i.e. a periodic potential which lacks the reflection symmetry .",
    "ratchet systems recently attracted much interest with respect to transport phenomena on the microscale , since they provide a mechanism to transfer the undirected motion of brownian particles into a directed motion .",
    "hence , the term _ brownian rectifiers _",
    "@xcite has been established . in order to reveal the microscopic mechanisms resulting in directed movement ,",
    "different physical ratchet models have been proposed @xcite , such as _ forced thermal ratchets _",

    "stochastic ratchets _",
    "@xcite , or _",
    "fluctuating ratchets _ @xcite .",
    "the model discussed in this paper , aims to add a new perspective to this problem which is based on the idea of internal energy storage . in sect . [ 2 ] , we discuss the basic features of our model without specifying an external potential , and derive the equations of motion both for the general case and the overdamped limit . in particular , we point to the possible existence of a `` high velocity '' or _ active mode _ of motion for the brownian particle , in addition to the usual passive mode of motion . in sect .",
    "[ 3 ] , the necessary conditions for such an active mode of motion are investigated for the case of a linear potential . for the overdamped limit",
    ", we derive critical parameters of energy conversion , which allows the particle to move also _ against _ the direction of the external force , i.e. to move `` uphill '' the potential gradient .",
    "the results are applied to the motion of brownian particles in a ratchet potential in sect . [ 4 ] . after investigating the deterministic motion of a single particle in sect . [ 4.1 ] , we discuss the energetic conditions for the establishment of a net current for the determinsitic motion of an ensemble of particles in sect .",
    "we show that , dependent on the conversion of internal into kinetic energy , a net current into different directions can be established .",
    "the critical parameters for the energy conversion and the resulting velocity of the net current , which are found by means of computer simulations , are compared with the analytical results obtained in sect . [ 2 ] .",
    "we also investigate the influence of the asymmetry of the ratchet potential on the establishment of the net current .",
    "the motion of simple brownian particles in a space - dependent potential , @xmath5 can be described by the langevin equation : @xmath6 where @xmath3 is the friction coefficient of the particle at position @xmath7 , moving with velocity @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is a stochastic force with strength @xmath10 and a @xmath11-correlated time dependence @xmath12 using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we assume that the loss of energy resulting from friction , and the gain of energy resulting from the stochastic force , are compensated in the average , and @xmath10 can be expressed as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "in addition to the dynamics described above , the brownian particles considered here are pumped with energy from the environment , which they can store in an internal depot .",
    "further , internal energy can be converted into kinetic energy .",
    "considering also internal dissipation , the resulting balance equation for the internal energy depot , @xmath16 , of a pumped brownian particle is given by : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the space - dependent pump rate of energy and @xmath19 describes the internal dissipation assumed to be proportional to the depot energy .",

    "a simple ansatz for @xmath20 reads : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conversion rate of internal into kinetic energy .",
    "the energy conversion results in an additional acceleration of the brownian particle in the direction of movement , expressed by the vector @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the equation of motion for the pumped brownian particles has to consider an additional driving force , @xmath24 . in @xcite , we have postulated a stochastic equation , which is consistent with the langevin eq .",

    "as long as the supply of the energy depot is small , we will also name the normal mode as the _ passive mode _ , because the particle is simply driven by the external force .",
    "more interesting is the case of three stationary velocities , @xmath47 , which significantly depends on the ( supercritical ) influence of the energy depot . in this case which will be discussed in detail in the following section , the particle will be able to move in a `` high velocity '' or _ active mode _ of motion .",

    "this is due to the subcritical supply of energy from the internal depot , which does not allow an uphill motion on any flank of the potential .",

    "for @xmath169 , the flank @xmath165 is too steep for the particles , therefore only a negative current can occur which corresponds to the unimodal velocity distribution discussed above . for @xmath170 , however , the particles are able to move uphill either flank",
    ". hence , also a positive current can establish and the velocity distribution becomes bimodal , which results in a positive net current .    the current reversal from a negative to a positive net current is shown in fig .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of brownian particles with an internal energy depot , which can be filled by the take - up of energy from the environment .",

    "we found that provided some supercritical energetic conditions , the brownian particles are able to move in a `` high velocity '' or active mode of motion characterized by a velocity much larger than the stokes velocity .",
    "the latter one can be denoted as the _ passive _ mode of motion .",
    "in addition to stochastic forces , it is basically determined by the response to the gradient of an external potential .",
    "one of the possible active modes of motion can be understood as a continuation of the passive or stokes mode , the particles motion in the direction of the force being accelerated .    _",
    "additionally _ , we also found an active mode which describes a motion of the particle _ against _ the gradient of an external potential .",
    "we have investigated the critical conditions for the deterministic motion of the particle in the overdamped limit for the case of a linear potential .",
    "we found that the `` uphill '' motion is described by two critical conversion rates .",
    "the bifurcation diagram shows that , at a critical value @xmath178 , the possibility of an `` uphill '' motion appears as a new solution for the stationary velocity , i.e. `` uphill '' motion requires the existence of multiple stationary solution for the velocity .",
    "however , this active mode remains unstable as long as the conversion rate is below a second critical value @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ d2-f ] ) , which depends on parameters describing the energy balance , such as the friction coefficient , @xmath3 , and the influx of energy into the depot , @xmath114 , and on the gradient of the potential , i.e. the resulting force @xmath45 .",
    "a _ stable _",
    "`` uphill ''",
    "motion occurs only for a supercritical conversion rate .",
    "these results allow us to interpret the deterministic motion of an ensemble of particles in a ratchet potential , i.e. a piecewise linear , periodic asymmetric potential with two different slopes .",
    "initially , the particles are equally distributed over the first period of the potential . in order to produce a current",
    ", the particles must be able to escape from the potential well , which depends on the supply of energy .",
    "we are able to find two different critical conversion rates , which describe the onset of a directed current into the different directions .",
    "as long as the particles are only able to move uphill the flank with the lower slope , we have an unimodal velocity distribution , corresponding to a negative net current .",
    "but if the particles are able to move uphill either flank , we find a bimodal velocity distribution , and a positive net current for the given conditions .",
    "hence , in the deterministic case the direction of the net current can be controlled via a single parameter , @xmath148 , which describes the conversion of internal into kinetic energy .",
    "we are able to calculate the critical parameter , as well as the resulting velocity of the net current from analytical considerations , which agree with the results found in the computer simulations .",
    "alternatively , the critical supply of energy can be also reformulated in terms of a critical asymmetry of the ratchet potential , which restricts the occurence of a ( positive or negative ) net current .    to conclude the results obtained , we have shown that an ensemble of pumped brownian particles moving in a ratchet potential can produce a _ directed net current_. in this respect",

    "the rocking ratchet @xcite or the diffusion ratchet @xcite which assume a spatially uniform time - periodic force , the force in our model switches between two constant values , dependent on the moving direction and the flank the particle is moving on . hence , it does not represent a spatially uniform force , and we may conclude that the mechanism of motion which eq .",
    "( [ x - overd ] ) is based on , should be different from the previous mechanisms which originate directed motion in a ratchet potential .    in this paper",
    ", we have restricted the discussion to the deterministic motion of brownian particles with an internal energy depot .",
    "we note that the stochastic motion of an ensemble of brownian particles in a ratchet potential will be investigated in detail in a forthcoming paper @xcite , which pays particular attention to the influence of stochastic effects on the establishment of the net current .",
    "additionally , we will also discuss the non - equilibrium distribution functions for brownian particles with internal energy depot @xcite .    as a final remark , we note in a more general sense that the introduction of an internal energy depot adds an interesting and new element to the known model of brownian particles , which can be useful in two different respects .",
    "with respect to the physical aspects , the dynamical system now has a _ new degree of freedom _ , which increases the phase space , @xmath180 .",
    "due to the additional energy supply , the system is driven into non - equilibrium .",
    "hence , a qualitative new behavior in the particle s motion can be obtained .    with respect to possible biological aspects ,",
    "the extension of the brownian particle model by mechanisms of energy take - up , storage and conversion , should contribute to the development of a _ microscopic theory _ of active biological motion .",
    "the final goal of such a project could be a microscopic image of well known phenomenological models of biological motion , taking into account energy balances that are related to the mechanisms of energy pumping and energy dissipation ."
