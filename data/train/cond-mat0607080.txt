    "@xcite even within these simple models , many peculiar features such as negative differential conductance ,  @xcite shuttling instability  @xcite and strong mechanical feedback  @xcitehave been predicted in the case of an underdamped oscillator .",
    "it is then a physically relevant question whether the vibrational energy is reduced by relaxation processes induced by coupling to an external environment  @xcite or rather because tunneling itself .",

    "@xcite a giant enhancement of fano factor ( @xmath2 ) has been predicted for strong coupling and negligible phonon relaxation .",
    "@xcite in the opposite limit of strong relaxation , i.e. when the phonons are thermally distributed , a nems behaves essentially as a single electron transistor ( set ) .",
    "@xcite shot noise in set has been extensively studied  @xcite and @xmath1 was always found to be larger or equal to @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite in this case , very low values of the fano factors stem from an highly ordered charge transfer mechanism given by strong correlations between charge and mechanical motion .    in this work",
    "we discuss how intermediate phonon relaxation influence the transport properties of a set coupled to a mechanical oscillator .",
