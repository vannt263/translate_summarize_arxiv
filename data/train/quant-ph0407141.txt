    "in the theory of light - matter interactions there is probably no more fundamental model than the two - level one @xcite . over the last decade , for example , the model has succedded in explaining the main features of propagation of strong a few - cycle pulses through atomic and semiconductor media @xcite , e.g. , carrier wave rabi flopping , third - harmonic generation in disguise of second harmonic and carrier - envelope phase effects , to name a few .",
    "it has also made a basis for the description of high - order harmonic generation from a single atom @xcite , a symmetric molecular ion @xcite and a double - well quantum structure @xcite with emphasis on the strongly non - perturbative picture of the phenomenon and the occurrence of peaks in the spectrum of coherently scattered light at the positions of even harmonics . when applied to double wells , the model turned out to be successful also in explaining the effect of laser control of tunneling @xcite .    despite its dissemination in atomic , molecular and solid state physics",
    "the two - level model of light - matter interaction still suffers from the lack of exact analytical solution covering the whole range of laser intensities as well as pulse shapes and durations .",
    "the analytical solutions known hitherto cover only some different limiting cases .",
    "for instance , the most celebrated rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) solution @xcite is restricted to laser intensities ensuring the resonance rabi frequency , @xmath0 , to be much smaller than the laser frequency , @xmath1 . beyond rwa ,",
    "the known analytical solutions include the non - rwa corrections along a perturbative procedure ( e.g. @xcite ) , either are valid in the so - called multiphoton excitation region @xcite ( @xmath2 along with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 stands for the frequency separation between the two levels ) or in the quite opposite strong coupling region @xcite ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "probably , the only analytical solution covering the whole intensity region is the recent one of tritschler , mcke and wegener @xcite for a box - shaped pulse , but obtained within the so - called square - wave approximation ( swa ) consisting in replacing the actual time behavior of the field within half the optical cycle by a square of a constant appropriately chosen magnitude .",
    "being approximate , this solution was able to reproduce only qualitatively some features of the exact numerical calculations , especially for the case of the resonant excitation ( @xmath7 ) , but was less convincing for distinctly off - resonant excitation .",
    "the aim of our paper is to present a quick iterative procedure for the problem of the two - level system in linearly polarized laser field , based on an analytical solution of the schrdinger equation in very short time intervals .",
    "the analytical solution turned out to be possible thanks to defining the problem of level populations in terms of a single nonlinear riccati - type differential equation in conjunction with dividing each halfcycle of the pulse into a number of narrow slices of equal width and considering constant the electric field within each slice with a value determined by the pulse function at the middle of the slice . the analytically obtained solutions for all slices in the pulse",
    "are then stick together by a simple recurrence formula derived relating the boundary conditions in the adjacent slices .",
    "this approach offers a simple analytical formula for the ratio of level population amplitudes within each slice , resulting in equally simple analytical formulae for population inversion , induced dipole moment and spectrum of the radiation emitted by this dipole . the photon - emission spectra obtained along the above line",
    "reproduce the numerically calculated ones available in literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , our iterative method indicates weak points of the square - wave solution of tritschler at el .",
    "@xcite and is proved to be particularly useful in the area of extreme nonlinear optics @xcite , i.e. , when a few - cycle , strong pulses stimulate significant population dynamics in a two  level system on a time scale of half the optical cycle .",
    "when presenting our analytical solution for short time intervals we start with the standard expansion @xmath8 for the wave function of the two - level system in a laser field , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 stands for the time - independent opposite - parity eigenstates of the bare system with eigenfrequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the time - dependent population amplitudes of the levels , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are then governed @xcite by the equation @xmath15 where both @xmath16 and @xmath17 run the values @xmath18 with the constrain @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the instantaneous rabi frequency with @xmath21 being the usual rabi frequency as determined by the dipole transition matrix element @xmath22 and the electric field amplitude @xmath23 , while @xmath24 describes the incident - field evolution with @xmath25 having the sense of pulse shape ( for pulses of at least few cycles in duration ) , @xmath1 the carrier frequency and @xmath26 the carrier - envelope offset phase .",
    "the latter is known @xcite to be a relevant quantity determining the response of the system in the regime of few - cycle pulses .",
    "traditionally , it has been solved in different coupling regimes either a set of two linear differential equations for @xmath27 with no rwa applied ( e.g @xcite ) or more often ( e.g. @xcite ) the resulting set of three linear differential equations for the bloch vector components : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "instead , we prefer to work with only one but nonlinear differential equation for the ratio @xmath31 of the population amplitudes . through the population conservation law , @xmath32 ,",
    "the above @xmath33 determines directly both the population inversion @xmath34 and the induced dipole moment @xmath35 and , consequently , the spectrum of coherently scattered light as well . after differentiating @xmath33 over time and then using eq .",
    "( [ jxxa ] ) one obtains @xcite @xmath33 to fulfil the following differential equation : @xmath36 where @xmath4 = @xmath37 is the frequency separation between the bare levels .",
    "this equation falls into the family of nonlinear riccati - type equations and a way for its iterative solution results from the transformation @xmath38 @xmath39 converting eq .",
    "( [ jyxa ] ) into @xmath40 to avoid the cumbersome second term on the right - hand side , including the derivative @xmath41 , we divide the time scale of the pulse into a number of sufficiently narrow intervals with @xmath42 being the running time within the @xmath43th interval . in each interval of its width",
    "much shorter than half an optical cycle we approximate the rabi frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 as constants of the values which they actually take in the middle @xmath46 of the interval . under such an approximation ,",
    "( [ r4oa ] ) when adapted to the @xmath43th interval looks like @xmath47 , where @xmath48 . the resulting equation has straightforward analytical solution @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial value of @xmath51 , i.e. , that at the beginning of the @xmath43th interval . for the extreme time in the interval , @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 , resulting in the recurrence formula for the initial conditions @xmath54 as a consequence of equations ( [ r5oa ] ) and ( [ r6oa ] ) we obtain from eq .",

    "the solutions in the form of eqs ( [ r7oa ] ) and ( [ r8oa ] ) allow us to obtain population inversion , induced dipole moment and electric field of coherently scattered light within the subsequent time intervals , @xmath62 , and to stick the solutions for the intervals to cover the whole time scale of the incident pulse .    before writing down the final formulae it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless strength parameter @xmath63 , the dimensionless level separation parameter @xmath64 and the dimensionless time parameter @xmath65 , where @xmath66 for a @xmath67-cycle pulse .",

    "<S> we formulate the problem of a two - level system in a linearly polarized laser field in terms of a nonlinear riccati - type differential equation and solve the equation analytically in time intervals much shorter than half the optical period . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solutions for subsequent intervals are then stuck together in an iterative procedure to cover the scale time of the laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applicable to pulses of arbitrary ( nonrelativistic ) strengths , shapes and durations , thus covering the whole region of light - matter couplings from weak through moderate to strong ones . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows quick insight into different problems from the field of light  matter interaction </S>",
    "<S> . very good quality of the method is shown by recovering with it a number of subtle effects met in earlier numerically calculated photon - emission spectra from model molecular ions , double quantum wells , atoms and semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented is an efficient mathematical tool to describe novel effects in the region of , e.g. , extreme nonlinear optics , i.e. , when two  level systems are exposed to pulses of only a few cycles in duration and strength ensuring the rabi frequency to approach and even exceed the laser light frequence . </S>"
