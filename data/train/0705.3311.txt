    "studies of the hyperon - nucleon interaction investigate weak processes that are not well understood in multiple baryon systems .",
    "in particular , the study of nonmesonic decays of light hypernuclei is the only tractable method of investigating the @xmath9 weak baryon - baryon interaction . by comprehensive measurements in s - shell hypernuclei",
    ", various @xmath10 initial states can be investigated .",
    "few - body nuclear structure calculations can then relate the decay rates to the underlying weak @xmath10 interactions .",
    "these studies are complementary to investigations of the parity - violating contributions to the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "however , the @xmath10 system can be prepared in a particle - stable state so that only weak processes contribute to the decay rate .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect of @xmath9 transitions is the empirical @xmath11 rule .",
    "we note that if strong interactions are neglected , the @xmath9 non - leptonic decays of hyperon systems would be expected to be dominated by a weak quark - level hamiltonian based on one w - exchange of the form : @xmath12 the isospin character of this fundamental hamiltonian does not favor @xmath11 weak transitions over the @xmath13 ones .",
    "however , it has long been recognized that the @xmath11 transitions dominate all observed non - leptonic decays of strange hadrons .",
    "although it is generally believed that the presence of the strong interaction accounts for this empirical @xmath11 selection rule , the various explanations for the dominance of the @xmath11 amplitudes  @xcite have indicated that the mechanism may be specific to the given system and not a universal feature of the @xmath9 weak hamiltonian .",
    "it remains an open question whether all @xmath14 non - leptonic decays obey the rule or it is specific to the pionic decay channels ( the only tested class of non - leptonic decays ) .",
    "the study of hypernuclear decays provides an opportunity to answer this question by providing the only experimentally accessible non - pionic test of the @xmath11 rule .    the total decay width of a hypernucleus includes contributions from mesonic and nonmesonic decay modes .",
    "the mesonic decay modes , defined experimentally by the observation of the appropriate pion in the final state , are dominated by single - body processes analogous to the decay of the free @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , along with additional multi - body contributions such as @xmath18 .",
    "the nonmesonic modes are expected to be dominated by the proton - stimulated reaction @xmath1 and neutron - stimulated reaction @xmath19 with rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "other multi - body interactions such as @xmath22 may also contribute with rate @xmath23 .",
    "determination of the nucleon - stimulated decay rates is more complicated than the mesonic case and is ultimately model dependent .",
    "the total decay width can be written in terms of the widths of these mesonic and nonmesonic decay modes as : @xmath24 where contributions from semileptonic and weak radiative @xmath15 decays have been neglected as they contribute only about 0.3% to the total free @xmath15 decay width  @xcite .",
    "the two - body nonmesonic decay modes , @xmath25 , are readily distinguishable from the mesonic decay modes , @xmath26 , because of the large energy ( @xmath27 ) available for the final - state nucleons .",
    "these modes are sensitive to weak interaction couplings ( such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) not available to the free hyperon decays .",
    "also , it has been suggested that several of the weak @xmath25 amplitudes are dominated by direct - quark processes  @xcite in which no intermediate meson is present in the interaction .",
    "such direct processes may not adhere to the @xmath30 rule .    in nuclei",
    "the @xmath15-particle is not pauli blocked , thus hypernuclei generally decay with the @xmath15-particle initially in the lowest @xmath31-state . in order to determine properties of the underlying @xmath25 interaction , it is convenient to consider systems that confine the nucleons to the lowest orbitals .",
    "figure  [ spinisospin ] shows the spin - isospin character of the initial ( @xmath10 ) and final ( @xmath32 ) states for @xmath33-shell hypernuclei in a single - particle shell model picture .",
    "the i=1 final states are accessible to both proton- and neutron - stimulated decays , while the i=0 final states are available only for proton - stimulated decay .",
    "further complications arise as one increases @xmath34 because the high probability of final - state interactions dilutes the correlation between nucleons observed and nucleons responsible for the decay .",
    "table  [ tbl - allowed ] shows that a complete set of measurements of the nonmesonic decay widths for the s - shell hypernuclei allows one to isolate specific @xmath10 initial states .",
    "thus , one can determine the spin - isospin structure of the fundamental @xmath35 weak interaction by combining measurements of these few - body hypernuclei with detailed finite nucleus calculations that take into account the differences in the initial and final state phase - space .",
    "however , at this time the experimental data are incomplete and often have large estimated errors .        using the simple model for nonmesonic decay introduced in sec .  [",
    "sec : nmes ] , the contributions of final - state interactions and three - body decays were studied utilizing the single - particle proton and neutron kinetic energy spectra , and upper limits for each case were determined as : @xmath37 for final - state interactions and decays , respectively ( 95% cl ) . within the model used here ,",
    "the effects of fsi and decays on pertinent quantities were seen to be small and , thus , have little effect on the final interpretation of the data .    in the analysis of the nonmesonic decay rates ,",
    "the various decay modes have been assumed to add incoherently , neglecting possible quantum interference effects .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that such interference effects may be the origin of the so - called puzzle , and garbarino _ et al _  @xcite point out that any interference effects would be less pronounced for multiple coincidence measurements , providing a cleaner extraction of the nonmesonic decay rates . for the case of",
    "presented here , the results of the two determinations ( listed in table  [ tab : svm ] ) are consistent , suggesting that interference effects are not significant at this level of statistics .",
    "a detailed study of the angular correlations in the multiple nucleon coincidence data might shed more light on the contributions of interference effects as well as fsi and decays , but the number of coincidence events in the present data set is too limited to provide anything conclusive .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "measurements of the nonmesonic decay rates for the @xmath33-shell hypernucleus are currently quite limited .",
    "the most recent results from outa _ et al _  @xcite give a value for the total nonmesonic rate of @xmath38 , but no measurements of the proton- and neutron - stimulated partial rates have been made . using the present results for @xmath39",
    ", these partial rates can be calculated in the context of the previously described phenomenological model of block and dalitz .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : hp ] , the upper limit of @xmath40 determined for the current measurement implies an upper limit of @xmath41 for the proton - stimulated rate under the assumption of pure @xmath42 transitions .",
    "a measurement of the proton - stimulated rate greater than this value would indicate a violation of the rule for the weak interaction .",
    "the neutron - stimulated decay rate was found from eq .",
    "[ eq : hn ] as @xmath43 .",
    "this calculation utilizes the result of outa _ et al _  for the ratio of the neutron- to proton - stimulated rates for @xmath44he , @xmath45  @xcite , but makes no assumptions regarding the rule . using this result ,",
    "an alternate determination of the proton - stimulated rate can be made from the result of outa _ et al _  for the total nonmesonic decay width of @xmath46 : @xmath47 which , again , is independent of any assumptions about the isospin nature of the interaction .",
    "because of the large error , this result is consistent with the upper limit found above .",
    "thus , at the present level of statistics for the measurement , nothing conclusive can be said about the rule for the weak interaction .",
    "the values of the nonmesonic decay rates derived from the above discussion represent the most current knowledge ( although indirect ) of the proton- and neutron - stimulated partial rates .",
    "the upper limit determined for the proton - stimulated decay rate suggests a direct measurement of this decay mode as an easy test of the rule for nucleon - stimulated decays ( _ i.e. _ , a measurement in excess of this upper limit would show a clear violation of the rule for the weak interaction ) .",
    "measurements of the nonmesonic decay rates along with more precise determinations of the and nonmesonic decay rates would help to further determine the isospin structure of the weak interaction .",
    "multiple nucleon coincidence studies can potentially provide the cleanest extraction of the nucleon - stimulated partial rates and would be a worthwhile avenue of future research .",
