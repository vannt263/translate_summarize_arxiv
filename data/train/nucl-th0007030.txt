    "such temperatures are believed to be created in nuclear collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "consequently , a phase where chiral symmetry is transiently restored may be formed in these collisions .",
    "the subsequent expansion cools the system and takes it to the final hadronic state , where chiral symmetry is again spontaneously broken .",
    "it is important to determine the order of the chiral transition , as this influences the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that a first order transition may lead to a deflagration wave and to a `` stall '' in the expansion of the system @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that a first order transition in rapidly expanding matter may manifest itself by strong non - statistical fluctuations due to droplet formation @xcite . in the case of strong supercooling",
    "it may lead to large fluctuations due to spinodal decomposition @xcite . in a second order phase transition one may expect the appearance of critical fluctuations due to a large correlation length @xcite .",
    "experimentally , large - acceptance detectors are now able to measure average as well as event - by - event observables , which in principle allow to distinguish between scenarios with a first order , a second order , or merely a crossover type of a phase transition .",

    "the effective theory for this order parameter is the same as the @xmath11 model which has a second order phase transition .",
    "therefore , by universality arguments @xcite , the chiral transition in @xmath12 qcd is likely to be of second order at @xmath13 .",
    "nonzero quark masses introduce a term in the qcd lagrangian which explicitly breaks chiral symmetry .",

    "one could define a crossover temperature as corresponding to a steepest descent region in the variation of @xmath50 .",

    "the sigma mass first decreases smoothly , then rebounds and grows again at high @xmath0 . the pion mass does not change much at temperatures below @xmath111 but then increases rapidly , approaching the sigma mass and signaling the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "as @xmath0 goes to infinity the masses grow linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath114 case is especially interesting in the sigma model .",
    "since the sigma field is the order parameter of the chiral phase transition , its mass must vanish at the critical point for a second order phase transition .",
    "this means that @xmath59 has zero curvature at this point .",
    "it is , however , not clear what the sigma mass should be at the critical point in the njl model where the quark condensate @xmath117 is the order parameter .",
    "[ mesmasst ] indeed shows that exactly at the critical point the sigma mass is zero in the sigma model .",
    "this is not the case in the njl model , at least within the rpa used here .    in fig .",

    "@xmath3 one clearly sees discontinuities in the behavior of the masses characteristic for the first order phase transition .",
    "an interesting point is that , in the linear sigma model , there is no stable phase with heavy quarks for @xmath3 , i.e. , the quark mass assumes its vacuum value all the way up to the chiral transition , and then drops to a small value in the phase where chiral symmetry is restored ( see fig .",
    "[ qmass ] ) .",
    "this behavior is related to the appearance of a bound state at zero pressure . within the linear sigma model this `` abnormal '' bound state",
    "was found by lee and wick a long time ago @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a similar bound state appears also in the njl model .",
    "this behavior , however , depends on the value of the coupling constant @xmath35 or @xmath75 . for our choice of @xmath35 and @xmath75 ,",
    "this state exists in the linear sigma model , but not in the njl model , where there is a stable phase of heavy quarks at @xmath3 , cf . figs .",
    "[ qmassfig ] and [ mesmassmu ] .",
    "in general , if the coupling constant is sufficiently large , then the attractive force between the constituent quarks becomes large enough to counterbalance the fermi pressure , thus giving rise to a bound state . to demonstrate this",
    "we have varied the coupling constant @xmath35 for the sigma model within reasonable limits .",
    "the results for the quark mass are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that , indeed , one can change the smooth crossover for @xmath70 into a first order transition by increasing the coupling constant ( fig",
    ". [ coup ] left panel ) and change the first order transition in the case  of @xmath3 into a smooth crossover . in this way",
    "a heavy quark phase comes into existence as the coupling constant is decreased and the bound state disappears ( fig.[coup ] right panel ) .",
    "an analogous investigation for the njl model leads to similar results .",
    "regarding hydrodynamical simulations the entropy per baryon is an interesting quantity .",
    "one can easily calculate it using standard thermodynamic relations , @xmath119 where @xmath120 are respectively the energy density , pressure and net density of the quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath58 ) . by studying this quantity",
    ", one can check if there is a tendency towards convergence of the adiabats towards the critical point as was claimed in ref .",
    "if this was the case it would be easy to actually hit or go close to this point in a hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "[ adiabats ] shows the contours of @xmath121 in the @xmath105 plane calculated in the sigma model ( left ) and in the njl model ( right ) .",
    "we actually observe a trend which is quite opposite to this expectation .",
    "it turns out that the adiabats turn away from the critical point when they hit the first order transition line and bend towards the critical point only when they come from the smooth crossover region .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "first , note that all adiabats terminate at zero temperature and @xmath122 , i.e. the @xmath105 combination corresponding to the vacuum .",
    "the reason is that as @xmath123 , also @xmath124 ( by the third law of thermodynamics ) , therefore , for fixed @xmath121 we have to require that @xmath125 , which is fulfilled when @xmath122 . for our choice of parameters , in the sigma model the point @xmath126",
    "is also the endpoint of the phase transition curve at @xmath3 , since the phase transition connects the vacuum directly with the phase of restored chiral symmetry , cf . figs .",
    "[ qmassfig ] and [ coup ] . for the njl model ,",
    "the endpoint of the phase transition curve is not identical with @xmath127 but is rather close to it .",
    "therefore , also the adiabats which hit the phase transition curve have to bend away from the critical point and approach the endpoint of the phase transition line at @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath0 decreases and @xmath71 increases .",
    "this behavior is quite opposite to the case underlying the claim in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hadronization of a large number of quark and gluon degrees of freedom into relatively few pion degrees of freedom leads to the release of latent heat and consequently to a reheating ( increase of @xmath0 ) through the phase transition .",
    "remember , however , that in our case there is actually no change in the number of degrees of freedom in the two phases , only in their respective masses .",
    "consequently , there is no `` focusing '' effect in the linear sigma and njl models .",
    "we investigated the thermodynamics of the chiral phase transition within the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the nambu - jona - lasinio model .",
    "these models have similar vacuum properties but treat the contribution of the dirac sea differently . in the sigma model this contribution is `` renormalized out '' while in the njl model it is included explicitly up to a momentum cutoff @xmath78 . by comparing thermodynamic properties of these two models",
    "one can check the importance of these vacuum terms . in both models",
    ", we found for small bare quark masses a smooth crossover for nonzero temperature and zero chemical potential and a first order transition for zero temperature and nonzero chemical potential .",
    "the first order phase transition line in the ( @xmath128 ) plane ended in the expected critical point .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath21 mass is zero at the critical point in the sigma model whereas in the njl model it always remains nonzero .",
    "the phase transition in the sigma model turned out to be of the liquid - gas type .",
    "this , however , depends on the coupling constant @xmath35 between the quarks and the chiral fields . from the comparison",
    "we conclude that the phase transition pattern is generally weaker in the njl model than the sigma model .",
    "certainly , it will be interesting to use both models in hydrodynamical simulations in order to confirm or disconfirm possible observable signatures of the phase transition discussed in the introduction .",
