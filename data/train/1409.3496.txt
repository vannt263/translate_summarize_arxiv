    "tuberculosis ( tb ) detection and treatment saved 22 million of lives , between 1995 and 2012 , following the 2013 report of the world health organization ( who ) @xcite .",
    "however , in 2012 , there were 8.6 million of new tb cases and 1.3 million of tb deaths @xcite .",
    "tb prevention , diagnosis and treatment , requires adequate funding , sustained over many years , which represents a worldwide scale challenge .",
    "mathematical dynamic models are an important tool in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases . many tb mathematical models",
    "have been developed  see , e.g. , @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the main differences of the models proposed in are the way they represent reinfection , since there is no consensus on wether a previous infection gives or not protection .",
    "the way recently infected individuals progress to active disease is not the same in all models : they can be `` fast progressors '' or `` slow progressors '' . in some models",
    ", it is assumed that only 5 to 10% of the infected individuals are fast progressors .",
    "the remaining models consider that individuals are able to contain the infection asymptomatic and non infectiously ( latent individuals ) , having a much lower probability of developing active disease by endogenous reactivation .",
    "more recent models also assume exogenous reinfection of latent and treated individuals , based on the fact that infection and/or disease do not confer full protection @xcite .",
    "this assumption has an important impact on the efficacy of interventions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a tb mathematical model from @xcite , where exogenous reinfection is considered .    without treatment , tb mortality rates are hight @xcite .",
    "different interventions are available for tb prevention and treatment : vaccination to prevent infection ; treatment to cure active tb ; treatment of latent tb to prevent endogenous reactivation . in this work",
    ", we study the implementation of two post - exposure interventions that are not widely used : treatment of early latent individuals with anti - tb drugs ( e.g. , treatment of recent contacts of index cases ) and prophylactic treatment / vaccination of the persistent latent individuals .",
    "we propose an optimal control problem that consists in analyzing how these two control measures should be implemented , for a certain time period , in order to reduce the number of active infected individuals , while controlling the interventions implementation costs .",
    "optimal control is a branch of mathematics developed to find optimal ways to control a dynamic system @xcite .",
    "other authors applied optimal control theory to tb models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach allows the study of the most cost - effective intervention design by generating an implementation design that minimizes an objective function .",
    "the intensity of interventions can be relaxed along time , which is not the case considered in most models , for which interventions are modeled by constant rates @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present the mathematical model for tb that will be study in this paper .",
    "two control functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are then added to the original model from @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : oc : problem ] is dedicated to the formulation of the optimal control problem .",
    "we prove the existence of an unique solution and derive the expression for the optimal controls according to the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : numericalresults ] has four subsections dedicated to a numerical and cost - effectiveness analysis of the optimal control problem .",
    "we start by illustrating the problem solutions for a particular case ( section  [ subsec : example ] ) .",
    "we then introduce some summary measures in section  [ subsec : smeasures ] to describe how the results change when varying transmission intensity ( section  [ subsec : beta ] ) and protection against reinfection ( section  [ subsec : sigma ] ) . in section  [ subsec :",
    "oc : strategies ] , we analyze the cost - effectiveness of three intervention strategies : applying @xmath0 or @xmath1 separately and applying the two control measures simultaneously .",
    "we end with section  [ sec : discussion ] of discussion .",
    "following the model proposed in @xcite , population is divided into five categories : susceptible ( @xmath2 ) ; early latent ( @xmath3 ) , , individuals recently infected ( less than two years ) but not infectious ; infected ( @xmath4 ) , , individuals who have active tb and are infectious ; persistent latent ( @xmath5 ) , , individuals who were infected and remain latent ; and recovered ( @xmath6 ) , , individuals who were previously infected and treated .",
    "we assume that at birth all individuals are equally susceptible and differentiate as they experience infection and respective therapy . the rate of birth and death , @xmath7 , are equal ( corresponding to a mean life time of 70 years @xcite ) and no disease - related deaths are considered , keeping the total population , @xmath8 , constant with @xmath9 .",
    "parameter @xmath10 denotes the rate at which individuals leave @xmath3 compartment ; @xmath11 is the proportion of infected individuals progressing directly to the active disease compartment @xmath4 ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the rates of endogenous reactivation for persistent latent infections ( untreated latent infections ) and for treated individuals ( for those who have undergone a therapeutic intervention ) , respectively .",
    "parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are factors that reduce the risk of infection , as a result of acquired immunity to a previous infection , for persistent latent individuals and for treated patients , respectively .",
    "these factors affect the rate of exogenous reinfection . as in @xcite , in our simulations",
    "we consider three different cases for the protection against reinfection conferred by treatment : same protection as natural infection ( @xmath16 ) ; lower protection than conferred by infection ( @xmath17 ) ; and higher protection than conferred by infection ( @xmath18 ) , see section  [ subsec : sigma ] .",
    "parameter @xmath19 is the rate of recovery under standard treatment of active tb , assuming an average duration of infectiousness of six months .",
    "the values of the rates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath19 are taken from @xcite and the references cited therein ( see table  [ parameters ] for the values of the parameters ) .",
    "additional to standard treatment of infectious individuals , we consider two post - exposure interventions targeting different sub - populations : early detection and treatment of recently infected individuals ( @xmath3 ) and chemotherapy or post - exposure vaccine of persistent latent individuals ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these interventions are applied at rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we consider , without loss of generality , that the rate of recovery of early latent individuals under post - exposure interventions is equal to the rate of recovery under treatment of active tb , @xmath22 , and greater than the rate of recovery of persistent latent individuals under post - exposure interventions , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in studying these interventions along time , we add to the original model two control functions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which represent the intensity at which these post - exposure interventions are applied at each time step .    the dynamical control system that we propose is given by @xmath26    the assumption that the total population @xmath8 is constant , allows to reduce the control system from five to four state variables .",
    "we decided to maintain the tb model in form , using relation @xmath27 as a test to confirm the numerical results .",
    ".parameter values for the control system .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     we align the remaining alternative strategies by increasing effectiveness and recompute the icer : icer(b)=acer(b)=5.7 and icer(a)=@xmath28 .",
    "hence , we conclude that strategy * b * has the least icer and therefore is more cost - effective than strategy * a*. for this illustration we have considered the same cost for both interventions ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "results should depend strongly on the choice of these parameters , however this discussion is out of the scope of our present work .",
    "in this work we study the potential of widespread of two post - exposure interventions that are not widely used : treatment of early latent individuals and prophylactic treatment / vaccination of persistent latent individuals .",
    "we propose an optimal control problem that consists in analysing how these two control measures should be implemented , for a certain time period , in order to reduce the number of active infected individuals , while controlling the interventions implementation costs .",
    "this approach differs from others @xcite since it allows intensity of intervention to be changed along time .",
    "as previous suggested @xcite , interventions impact can be sensitive to transmission intensity and reinfection .",
    "we choose a dimensionless measure of effectiveness to compare different scenarios : assuming different transmission intensity ( @xmath30 ) or assuming different assumptions on protection against reinfection conferred by treatment ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "effectiveness of optimal intervention decreases with transmission .",
    "there is a change in the intervention profile from low to high transmission . in high transmission settings ,",
    "the intensity of treatment of persistent latent individuals @xmath31 for the optimal solution is reduced . since treatment of persistent latent individuals reduces the reactivation rate ( from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) , when reinfection is very common and it overcomes reactivation impact , the advantage of treating this population group is less pronounced .",
    "the susceptibility to reinfection after treatment is still an open question . in one hand",
    ", treatment can reduce the risk of tb by reducing the amount of bacteria present in the lungs .",
    "on the other hand , we can argue that latent infection boosts immunity by constant stimulation of the immune system , so treatment could reduce protection .",
    "we vary parameter @xmath15 to explore these two possible scenarios : @xmath32 when treatment enhances protection and @xmath33 when treatment impairs protection .",
    "results show that treatment of persistent latent individuals should be less intense or even absent for the case where treatment impairs protection .",
    "similar results were obtained for the case of constant treatment rates in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the correspondent case with maximum intensity ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , we can have an increase of the equilibrium proportion of infectious individuals ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we can conclude that reinfection has an important role in the determination of the optimal control strategy , by diminishing the intervention intensity on persistent latent individuals : first when transmission is very high corresponding to a very high reinfection rate and secondly when this population group has a lower susceptibility to reinfection ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "interestingly , the reinfection threshold @xmath38 of the model with no controls still marks a change in the model behaviour . even though , we are comparing equilibrium results to transient short time interventions .",
    "cost - effectiveness analysis of alternative combinations of the two interventions is conducted . for @xmath39 , treatment of only early latent individuals",
    "is the more cost - effective strategy , despite of treatment of both early latent and persistent latent individuals having a higher effectiveness .",
    "the total cost associated with treatment of persistent latent individuals is very high , especially because this population group can be very big in comparison to the others .",
    "it is believed that about one third of world s population is latent infected with tb . here , for simplicity",
    ", we have considered the cost parameters both equal to one .",
    "however , this depends greatly on the type of intervention used and results can be changed . for example , if intervention on persistent latent individuals could be done by vaccination , then the per person unit cost could be significantly reduced . plus ,",
    "treatment of early latent individuals implies contact tracing of index cases and prophylactic treatment , which can also be very expensive .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath40 associated to the problem in is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the _ adjoint vector_. according to the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite , if @xmath43 is optimal for problem  with the initial conditions given in table  [ icbeta100 ] and fixed final time @xmath44 , then there exists a nontrivial absolutely continuous mapping @xmath45",
