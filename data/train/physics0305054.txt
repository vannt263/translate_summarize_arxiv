    "convergence is obtained in 20 iterations of this procedure , typically . using the field obtained above , we then updated the occupancies , reevaluating the @xmath35 by performing additional few - body simulations to evaluate the work associated with turning on the molecular field using thermodynamic integration @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a coupling parameter , and @xmath38 indicates averaging over configurations generated under the influence of the molecular field scaled as @xmath39 . using these recalculated @xmath24 , we generated a new set of @xmath32 , tested for convergence , and so on .",
