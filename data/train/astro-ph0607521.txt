    ", the light curve for any detectable source will be well sampled .",
    "also , the scanning motion will permit frequent evaluation of the stability of the performance of the lat with respect to `` standard candle '' sources .",
    "based on the expected sensitivity of the lat , a source with flux @xmath10@xmath77 @xmath5 s@xmath6 and the hardness of the solar ic emission will be detectable on a daily basis when the sun is not close to the galactic plane , where the diffuse emission is brightest .",
    "sensitive variability studies of the bright core of the ic emission surrounding the sun should be possible on weekly time scales . with exposure accumulated over several months , the sun should be resolved as an extended source and potentially its ic , @xmath9-decay , and bremsstrahlung components separated spatially .",
    "the extended ic emission is not isotropic , but accumulated over year timescales will be uniform in ecliptic longitude and brightest at low ecliptic latitudes . the ecliptic plane crosses the galactic plane near the galactic centre , and the solar ic component may be important for investigating the nature of the reported `` halo '' of @xmath0-raysabout the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "the solar ic contribution to the overall celestial diffuse emission can be modelled directly as we have done here .",
    "measurement of the spectrum of solar ic emission in the near sun direction fixes the emission at all angles .",
    "this is especially true at high energies where the solar modulation in the outer heliosphere is negligible .",

    "in this paper we have studied the ic scattering of solar photons by cr electrons .",
    "we have shown that the emission is significant and broadly distributed with maximum brightness in the direction of the sun .",
    "the whole sky is shining in @xmath0-rays  contributing to a foreground that would otherwise be ascribed to the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission .",
    "the ic emission from cr electrons depends on their spectrum in the heliosphere and varies with the modulation level .",
    "observations in different directions can be used to determine the electron spectrum at different heliocentric distances .",
    "a sensitive @xmath0-ray  telescope on orbit could monitor the heliosphere , providing information on its dynamics .",
    "such observations also could be used to study the electron spectrum in close proximity to the sun , unreachable for direct measurements by spacecraft .",
    "the assumed isotropy of the electron distribution everywhere in the heliosphere is an approximation .",
    "closer to the sun , the magnetic field and non - isotropic solar wind speed affect the cr electron spectrum and angular distribution , which in turn will produce asymmetries in the ic emission .",
    "observations of such asymmetries may provide us with information about the magnetic field and solar wind speed at different heliolatitudes including far away from the ecliptic .",
    "what are the immediate implications ?",
    "since solar modulation theory is well developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accurate measurement of the electron spectrum near the solar surface will open the way to derive the spectra of other galactic cr species , primarily protons , near the sun .",
    "the cr proton spectrum is the input to calculations of @xmath0-rays  from @xmath1-interactions in the solar atmosphere .",
    "these predictions can be further tested using glast observations of pionic @xmath0-rays  from the sun . in turn",
    ", this would provide information about the density profile of the solar atmosphere , magnetic field(s ) , and cr cascade development @xcite .",
    "the higher the energy of @xmath0-rays , the higher the energy of the ambient particles , and thus the depth of the layers tested is increased . in conjunction with other solar monitors",
    "this can bring understanding of the deep atmospheric layers , sun spots , magnetic storms , and other solar activity .",
    "furthermore , understanding the solar atmosphere is necessary to calculate the neutrino flux from @xmath1-interactions at higher energies ( @xmath21 tev ) , as the cr shower development depends on the density distribution and the underlying magnetic field structure ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "although small , the vhe neutrino flux from the sun is a `` guaranteed flux '' in contrast to other astrophysical sources of neutrinos . it may be detectable by km@xmath3 neutrino telescopes of the near future , such as icecube ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on a timescale of a year or several years",
    ". therefore , only long term periodicities associated with the solar activity could be detectable . since the solar core is opaque for vhe neutrinos @xcite , observations of the neutrino flux may provide us with information about the solar mass distribution .",
    "to summarise , we have shown that the observation of the ic emission from cr electrons in the heliosphere and its distribution on the sky will open a new chapter in astrophysics .",
    "this makes a sensitive @xmath0-raytelescope a useful tool to monitor the heliosphere and heliospheric propagation of cr , and to study cr interactions in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we noticed an error in the description of the distribution of solar photons at an arbitrary distance from the sun , equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",

    "@xmath79 is independent of @xmath80 within the solid angle covered by the sun . applying the correct angular distribution",
    "does not give results that are noticeably different from those obtained with the delta - function ( pure radial ) photon distribution .",
    "indeed , it should be the case since in the energy range under consideration @xmath81 and the ambient photon angular distribution can be approximated by the delta - function .",
