    "the existence of voids has been evident after the discovery by kirshner et al . of a large void with diameter of @xmath3 mpc in botes ( @xcite ) .",
    "systematic surveys have shown the existence of many regions with similar characteristics .",
    "computer analysis of galaxy distribution gives evidence that voids occupy about 50% of the volume of the universe ( e.g. see @xcite ) or , according to a more recent paper ( @xcite ) , about @xmath4% of the volume of the universe .",
    "today , there is a large agreement on the issue that voids are not just empty regions of space , but that they are regions with a very low density of luminous matter .",
    "as observed by peebles ( @xcite ) , the low dispersion of velocities of galaxies indicates that most of matter must be inside the voids , not only if the density parameter ( for the matter component ) is @xmath5 but also in the case @xmath6 . in any case , recent observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that the total value of density parameter is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this case",
    "@xmath10 is the contribution due to the whole content of unclustered matter which can be cosmological constant , some kind of scalar field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or , in general , `` dark energy '' .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the visual inspection of galaxy distribution suggests nothing else but the absence of large amount of luminous matter in wide regions .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether the voids are spherical regions approximately empty or under - dense regions with arbitrary shapes .",
    "several definitions of voids have been proposed , but a general agreement on their real nature has not been reached yet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the swiss - cheese cosmological model , initially proposed by einstein and straus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , appears suitable for the description of the cosmological voids . in a recent paper ( @xcite ) , it was proposed an approach for the formation of the cosmological voids in the framework of such model .",
    "it was shown that voids are the consequence of the collapse of extremely large wavelength perturbations into low - density black holes and of the comoving expansion of matter surrounding the collapsed perturbations .    as a result , it was claimed that in the center of each void there is a black hole whose mass @xmath11 compensates the mass which the void would have if it were completely filled with matter having a cosmological density .    in @xcite ,",
    "the voids are empty regions of the universe which grow comovingly with the cosmological expansion . in that case",
    ", the presence of cosmic background radiation was neglected .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the physical mechanism capable of explaining the structure of voids in presence of baryonic matter , cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) with central black holes acting as seeds .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : in sect.2 , we will present the cosmological black hole ( cbh ) model in the framework of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the discussion of the effects of interaction between the cbr and cbh .",
    "a mechanism for the formation of an under - density regime void is analyzed in sect.4 , while the matching with observations , which allows to determine the initial time of voids formation and the mass function of cbhs , is studied in sect.5 .",
    "the discussion of results and conclusions are given in sect.6 .",
    "the cosmological model proposed in @xcite is an einstein - straus universe which is embedded in a flrw metric .",
    "a central spherical black hole with mass @xmath12 is present in all the voids .    in eq .",
    "( [ massflat ] ) , the parameter @xmath13 represents the fraction of density due to all these black holes with respect to the total density of the universe ; @xmath14 is the today critical density of the universe .",
    "all the voids are assumed to be spherical .",
    "a black hole forms when a body of mass @xmath11 collapses entirely within a sphere of radius    @xmath15    this statement is equivalent to say that its density satisfies the relation , @xmath16 conversely , eq.([schwdens1 ] ) relates to any density a corresponding schwarzschild radius . in other words ,",
    "any space - like sphere of matter , with uniform density @xmath17 and radius equal to @xmath18 , is a black hole .    from eqs.([massflat ] ) and ( [ schw ] ) , we determine the mass @xmath11 and the corresponding schwarzschild radius and consequently , from eq.([schwdens1 ] ) the mass density of the central black hole .",
    "for example , a black hole in the center of a @xmath19 mpc diameter void would have a mass @xmath20 corresponding to a schwarzschild radius @xmath21 kpc and a density of @xmath22 .",
    "the above value of density is the one reached by the collapsing matter when it crossed the schwarzschild radius .",
    "it suggests that the process of formation of a cbh started with large wavelength perturbations at cosmological densities of the order of @xmath23 i.e for @xmath24 .",
    "according to the inflationary scenario , we only need to suppose that the inflation occurred during a time long enough to provide such perturbations .",
    "it is important to note that , since the einstein - straus model assumes spherical symmetry , the perturbation does not experience the cosmic expansion during its collapse .",
    "for this reason , we can assume that the total mass of perturbation @xmath25 remains constant during the whole process .",
    "the schwarzschild radius of the spherical perturbation is equal to    @xmath26    we can distinguish two cases .",
    "the case in which the relation @xmath27 is satisfied .",
    "the perturbation is in linear regime and , according to the evolution equations of a universe with perfect fluid equation of state , it is frozen when @xmath28 is larger than the hubble radius ( @xcite ) . after crossing the hubble horizon ,",
    "it collapses and becomes a black hole when @xmath29 in the case @xmath30 the perturbation evolves as shown in @xcite . during the contraction",
    ", it becomes unavoidably a black hole if the final density is very low and the internal pressure and temperature can not raise to values large enough to prevent the collapse .",
    "this is true also when the perturbation enters in a non - linear regime .",
    "in addition , any possible centrifugal barrier can be reduced to values smaller than the schwarzschild radius ( @xcite ) by the interaction of collapsing matter with the cosmic background radiation . according to the einstein - straus model , after the formation of black hole , the matter around it expands in a comoving way leading to the formation of an empty region between it and the rest of the universe .",
    "as the central black hole can not be seen , the whole region appears as a void to an external observer .",
    "a cbh can be detected through its lensing properties , since it behaves like a schwarzschild gravitational lens . according to our hypothesis",
    ", a cbh sits in the center of a void and the einstein angle is ( @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radius of the void , @xmath33 is the distance of the source from the observer , @xmath34 is the distance of the source from the cbh , and @xmath35 is the distance of the cbh from the observer , all these quantities are expressed in mpc . for a 50 mpc void of diameter , with the center placed at a distance of 80 mpc from the sun and with the source at the opposite edge of the void",
    ", we expect a deflection angle @xmath36 on the other hand , zeldovich and sazhin point out in ( @xcite ) , that generally static structures can raise the temperature of the cosmic background radiation by an amount proportional to the hubble parameter and the gravitational time delay . by considering the swiss - cheese model case",
    ", they find a fluctuation of temperature @xmath37 for a giant galaxy ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "since this result is proportional to the mass , it follows that it corresponds to a fluctuation of temperature @xmath39 for a large cbh with mass ( @xmath40 , which does not contradict the recent boomerang and wmap measurements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feauture of voids with central cbh is derived starting from a swiss - cheese model based on an einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "to this aim , let us consider the energy balance in newtonian terms for a galaxy with mass @xmath41 sitting on the edge of a void i.e at a distance @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a covariant radius .",
    "we have @xmath44    as the void is comovingly expanding , we can impose @xmath45 .",
    "the mass @xmath46 inside the void is @xmath47    by eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , one obtains @xmath48\\ ] ] and then @xmath49.\\ ] ] from this relation , we see that , @xmath50 if @xmath51 , i.e. the expansion velocity of a galaxy on the edge of a void coincides with the escape velocity and @xmath52 , we are taking into account all the contributions to the energy density as matter and radiation . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "a galaxy on the edge of a void is gravitationally bounded with a cbh , if @xmath53 . in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt as _ definition _ of edge of a void the spherical region where the galaxies have energy @xmath50 .",
    "these considerations can be immediately extended to the case in which the spatial curvature is different from zero ( i.e. to friedmann models different from the considered einstein - de sitter one ) .",
    "this simply implies that @xmath54 and eq.([3 ] ) becames @xmath55.\\ ] ] in this case , the value of @xmath56 depends also on @xmath57 .",
    "so far we have considered the einstein - straus swiss - cheese model in a universe filled only with matter . in this section , we shall show how the interaction with cbr will lead to an accretion of cbh .",
    "since the pressure of radiation is different from zero , the radiation itself may cross the edge of the voids regardless the einstein - straus junction conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as we consider this physical process during the matter epoch , we can neglect the contribution of radiation to the black hole formation .",
    "a cbh absorbs energy from cbr according to the law ( @xcite )    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the gravitational cross section of cbh and @xmath60 is the radiation flux of cbr .    in a matter dominated universe , ( dust ) ,",
    "the evolution of radiation density is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the equation of state is @xmath63 .",
    "immediately , we get @xmath64 where the constant @xmath65 has the dimensions @xmath66 $ ] . at present epoch , assuming @xmath67 ( this value is consistent with wmap observations ( @xcite ) for @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 , we obtain    @xmath70    dropping the physical dimensions .",
    "eq.([accretion ] ) becomes @xmath71    integrating from an initial epoch @xmath72 to the present epoch , we have that the ratio between the present mass @xmath73 and the initial mass @xmath74 is    @xmath75    if @xmath76 , we can approximate the formula for the mass accretion to    @xmath77    the growth of mass of a cbh is then @xmath78.\\ ] ]    for @xmath76 , we have @xmath79    therefore , it is evident that the bh accretion is proportional to its initial mass .",
    "from the point of view of density , voids are under - dense regions of space depleted of galaxies with respect to the external background",
    ". we can estimate the amount of such an under - density in the framework of our cbh - void model .",
    "taking into account the accretion process in the void , we can not neglect the fact that , as the void increases in volume , a certain amount of galaxies enter in the void contributing to the total mass inside the void .",
    "this implies that the accretion of mass inside the void , given by ( [ accretion ] ) , has to be corrected as    @xmath80    factor @xmath81 can be justified in the following way .",
    "if we consider any mass increment in eq.([energy ] ) , it is easy to observe that the mass of galaxies entering in the void is equal to the mass increment of the black hole , if one takes into account the conservation equation for @xmath52 . in first approximation",
    ", one can double the righthand side of eq.([accretion ] ) . to be rigorous",
    ", one should consider a delay effect , since gravity does not propagates instantaneously .",
    "due to this fact , it would be correct to deal with this problem under the standard of the general relativity .",
    "however , it is possible to show that the delay effect can be neglected , at least in first approximation .    to find the density of galaxies @xmath82 which enter to expanding voids",
    ", one has to subtract the accreted mass of cbh , obtained from eq.([approx ] ) , to the total final accretion mass , given by eq.([accretionv ] ) , ( in the approximation @xmath76 )    @xmath83    and divide the result by the volume of the void taken as @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we find that    @xmath85    the under - density is given by the contrast of density of galaxies in the void with the total density @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the volume of the void expressed in @xmath88 and @xmath72 is the initial time expressed in seconds . from this last equation",
    ", we obtain the formula for the initial time @xmath72 , which is @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath87 can be retrieved from the respective values found in the catalogs ( @xcite ) . on the other side",
    "we can also determine the initial masses of the cbhs just after their formation .",
    "this can be expressed by the formula @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the internal density of the void .",
    "using the data of the volume and the under - density of voids given in the catalog of el - ad and piran ( @xcite ) which deduced their data from ssrs2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and iras ( @xcite ) observations , we found the following initial times and corresponding initial and final masses according to formulas ( [ ti ] , [ mi ] , [ approxvoid ] ) .",
    "1truecm    1truecm * table 1 * : evolution of voids and black holes features derived from our model using the data in @xcite .",
    "dynamics deduced from our model is consistent with observations and seems to confirm the gravitational origin of voids . in this approach ,",
    "the role of dark matter has to be revised since most of the mass ( about one half ) of the structure is concentred in the central cbh . in this picture , it is only the density contrast between voids and background which drives dynamics .",
    "cbhs are just the remnant of primordial collapsed perturbations while voids , or precisely the edges of voids , are the result of perturbations which wavelength following the cosmic expansion .",
    "the whole system , also if expanding and interacting with cbr , remains in equilibrium .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a model where cosmological black holes are seeds for large scale structure voids .",
    "such systems come out from the evolution of primordial perturbations and result as stable structures from @xmath0 up to now .",
    "they enlarge till diameters of about @xmath1 and the under - density of voids is of the order @xmath2 with respect to the background .",
    "the whole structure is a sort of honeycombs where most of galaxies ( i.e. luminous matter ) are located on the edge of voids while most of dynamical mass is sited in the central black hole .",
    "the edge is defined by a natural equilibrium condition on the energy due to the balance of gravitational pull of the central black hole and the cosmic expansion .",
    "the cosmic background radiation contributes to the accretion of black hole flowing inside the void but its homogeneity and isotropy is not affected in agreement with data .",
    "the picture which emerge agrees with optical and iras observation ( @xcite ) giving a @xmath93 of the volume filled by voids with the above characteristics .",
    "the presence of central black holes seems to confirm the gravitational origin of the voids and stabilizes the system against cosmic expansion preventing its evaporation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the order of magnitude observed for the masses of cbh concides with the one of the great attractor ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is very tempting for us to identify the great attractor as a cbh and to use the model described in this paper for explaining the large scale motions observed for the galaxies surrounding it .",
    "however , the main problem with observations of cosmic velocity fields ( @xcite ) is that the voids are , in general , the contrary to great attractor , and large scale structure around the voids do not show velocity fields converging toward the voids , but toward the visible clusters and superclusters around the voids .",
    "this apparent shortcoming , in the framework of our model ( see also @xcite ) , can be overcome by the birkoff theorem which states that the stationary solutions are also static if the spherical symmetry is restored .",
    "so , a fraction of galaxies is attracted by clusters and superclusters `` outside '' the void while another fraction has no dynamics since it has been already attracted `` inside '' the void .",
    "this fact could be interpreted as an early selection due to a competitive mechanism between cbhs and external matter contained into clusters and superclusters .    however ,",
    "if the swiss - cheese model were always valid such a selection would have never been achieved ; instead , in a more realistic situation , the model holds only approximately so then we have to expect galaxies inside and outside the void due to the deviations from sphericity and to the perturbations of the cbh mass .",
    "furthermore , as observed in @xcite and @xcite , the small relative velocity dispersion shows that , if @xmath94 , then most of the mass has to be contained into the voids .",
    "the same authors conjecture that this must be true even when @xmath95 is smaller than 1 as predicted by several cdm simulations ."
