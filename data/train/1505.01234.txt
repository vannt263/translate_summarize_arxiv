    "stokes equations that we will be observing through nodal measurements of the velocity field .",
    "section 3 reports our computational results , and section 4 gives details of our computational methods .",
    "the last section concludes that data assimilation of nodal measurements , by means of equation  ( [ alg2 ] ) , as studied in this paper works computationally just as efficiently as equation  ( [ alg1 ] ) with fourier modes .",
    "to focus on how the smoothing and resolution of the observational measurements affect algorithm ( [ alg2 ] ) , as well as how to optimize the value of the relaxation ( nudging ) parameter @xmath60 , we fix the viscosity and the size of the periodic box so that @xmath102 for the remainder of this paper .",
    "we further perform all our simulations using the same reference solution @xmath103 to the two - dimensional incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations .",
    "as shown in @xcite the spatial structure of the function @xmath49 used to force the reference solution can have a significant effect on data assimilation .",

    ", if @xmath60 is too small , the feedback control ( nudging term ) will be too weak to ensure the approximating solution converges to the reference solution . if @xmath60 is too large , then spill over into the fine scales becomes significant and again prevents recovery of the reference solution .",
