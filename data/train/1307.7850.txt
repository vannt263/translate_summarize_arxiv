    "in the 21st century a phenomenon of the high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates continues to attract the attention of many researches @xcite .",
    "there are a tremendous number of suggested mechanisms of this phenomenon . in any case",
    "there is not a such theory which would describe all properties of this complicated state . in this work",
    "we have centered on the main pecuilarity which in our opinion might help to illuminate the origin of high -t@xmath0 in cuprates .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling is supposed to be not essential in the cooper electron pairings .",
    "but this interaction forms the polaron excitations which play an imortant role in the correlation narrowing of the electron band . in that case",
    "it is necessary to differentiate the collectivized electrons in metals and ones in doped cuprates .",
    "indeed , in metals there is wave electron states with a possibility of the site double occupancy .",
    "but their hole states is virtual . and that s why we have the partition function @xmath1 for electron excitations @xmath2 . in cuprates",
    "a coordinate representation is realized for electron wave functions and we have the partition function @xmath3 with electron levels @xmath4 and hole state .    the cuprates belong to class of the strongly correlated electron system . in work",
    "@xcite an effective hamiltonian of the t - j model was suggested based on the use of gutzwiller projection operator .",
    "it allowed to exclude the upper hubbard band with double site occupancy by electrons and essentially to simplify an investigation of the strongly correlated electron systems . in work",
    "@xcite a mean field approximation of the t - j model was developed to study the high - temperature superconductivity . in this work a fundamental idea about spin pairing via electron exchange interaction was formulated .",
    "unfortunately , authors were not taken into account the essential difference between metal and strongly correlated electrons .",
    "using bogolyubov s u - v transform of the hamiltonian they obtained the equation for gap function to be similar in bcs theory .    in this work",
    "we propose to divide the mean field bcs type hamiltonian into uniform and nonuniform parts .",
    "the perturbation theory was built with uniform unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the nonuniform part is neglected since it has a weak influence on the hopping integral .",
    "a hopping term of the total t - j hamiltonian is considered as perturbation in the limit of a weak doping with @xmath5 u - v transformed creation and destruction operators .",
    "the anormal mean values to be proportional the superconductive gap function were calculated .",
    "it has been obtained the condition on values of the chemical potential and exchange parameter . with account of the correlation band narrowing we make the conclusion about impossibility of htsc in the pure t - j model .    in",
    "what follow we include into consideration the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the evidences for a presence of one and its important role in the strongly correlated systems were emphasised in works @xcite . in view of",
    "the fact that hamiltonian of electron - phonon coupling is nonuniform many authors simplify the kinematic part by simple renormalization of the hopping integral @xcite or use the theory of eliashberg for collectivized metal electrons @xcite . in former case it gives rise to drastic supression of the electron band and is responsible for the absence of htsc in a system without interaction of polarons .",
    "the simplest form of the holstein hamiltonian for polarons needs to be considered with uniform electron - phonon interaction and einstein phonon mode .",
    "one can provide the exact unitary transform to separate fermion and boson degree of freedom .",
    "it allows to build the subsequent perturbation theory of the strongly correlated electron system with holstein s polarons .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "in sec.ii we consider the hamiltonian of pure t - j model in the superconducting state .",
    "it was separated the uniform mean field part with correponding coefficients of u - v transform .",
    "it enables us in sec.iii to build the perturbation theory for strongly correlated electrons in the superconducting state .",
    "in particular , it was obtained the transformed hubbard operators in coordinate representation using the bogolyubov s u - v transform . as a result , the equation for gap function and conditions for superconducting state were presented . in sec .",
    "iv the properties of normal state without electron - phonon coupling are considered . in the framework of the developed diagrammatic method",
    "it was shown the absence of superconductivity in a pure t - j model . in sec.v",
    ". a normal state of the cuprate d - electrons with polaron excitations is investigated to find the critical temperature of superconducting state . in this section",
    "it has been solved the problem of a frequency summation with infinity number of poles as implicit functions .",
    "the suggested method of an inverse function allowed to calculate the diagrammatic contributions for all polaron bands . in sec.v the obtained equations are solved numerically that allowed to find the concentration dependences of the critical temperature _",

    "the theoretical values of _ _ t__@xmath0 and @xmath6 are in good agreement with experiment that supports the model to put forward by us .",
    "the hamiltonian of the holstein model with strongly correlated electrons takes the form : @xmath7 where the fermi part , @xmath8 , is expressed as follows : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the indirect exchange of the collectivized d - electrons with spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the electron concentration on @xmath14-site , @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",

    "the hamiltonian  ( [ energy02 ] ) of @xmath23 t - j model reflects the strong electron correlations . in a weak doping level we will consider the part  ( [ energy03 ] ) as a perturbation .    the boson part of hamiltonian  ( [ energy01 ] ) has a form similar to that used in the holstein model of a small polaron : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electron - phonon coupling strength , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the phonon creation and destruction operators . we will use the einstein model where the phonon frequency @xmath28 is assumed to be dispersion - free .    the lang - firsov unitary transform@xcite @xmath29 of hamiltonian  ( [ energy04 ] ) allows to separate the boson and fermion operators in  ( [ energy04 ] ) , where @xmath30 . as a result",

    "the gap functions are expressed via exchange parameters : @xmath43    in a wave space the hamiltonian  ( [ energy08 ] ) takes the form @xmath44 where the gap functions @xmath45 can be presented as @xmath46 and @xmath47 is conjugate function @xmath45 .",
    "one can point out that in eqs .",

    ". then one can put @xmath57    so far it has been obtained that the bcs hamiltonian  ( [ energy14 ] ) coincides with similar hamiltonian of baskaran - zou - anderson @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of work @xcite do not separate perturbation @xmath16 from  ( [ energy01 ] ) . instead of this",

    "the scattering matrix formalism for a system with strongly correlated electrons differs from that in the band theory of metals . indeed , in our case we must exclude the upper hubbard s band by gutzwiller s projection operator . as a result one can not use the wave representation at disentanglement of correlators arising from series of the perturbation theory .",
    "unfortunately , the bcs hamiltonian is diagonalized if and only if we work in @xmath80-space .",
    "that s why , the coordinate representation  ( [ energy26 ] ) is introduced to connect the coordinate and @xmath80-spaces of transformed hamiltonian .",
    "there is a powerful method of hubbard operators to account for excluding of double electron site occupancy . in works",
    "@xcite the general diagram method for hubbard operator was presented .",

    "apparently , from condition @xmath87 one can neglect the influence of order parameter @xmath6 on @xmath15 . in the second case",
    "we will have the equation for a gap function .",
    "since the femion and boson subsystems are divided in accordance with hamiltonian  ( [ energy05 ] ) now we will consider creation and destruction operators with one tilda corresponding to u - v transform .",

    "unfortunately , the vick s theorem can not be used for transformed hubbard s operators in acoordance with  ( [ energy07 ] ) .",
    "that s why , for averaging we have to separate the boson subsystem from fermion . in case of isolated pairings a such separation is not needed . as it will be seen later a similar situation",
    "is realized for effective kinematic interaction and diagrams to be formed by one effective line of interactions and one unperturbed green s function .",
