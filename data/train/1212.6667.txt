    "assuming the kerr geometry , the keplerian and epicyclic orbital frequencies ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) for a given radius depend only on mass @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 of the black hole .",
    "it is therefore possible to infer the black hole spin or mass from the observed 3:2 frequencies and concrete orbital qpo models .",
    "the 3:2 qpo frequencies in grs  1915@xmath1105 are given by @xmath9 assuming relation ( [ equation:3:2 ] ) and the well known formulae for the orbital frequencies , we calculate the implied mass - spin functions for the models associating the 3:2 qpos with common radii by means of the definition relations given in table  [ table1 ] . following  @xcite and taking into account the estimated range of the mass of grs  1915@xmath1105 , @xmath10 we infer the expected ranges of the spin .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the above considered models assume that both of the observed 3:2 frequencies are produced by the same mechanism and excited at a certain ( common ) preferred radius . for the discoseismic modes the individual observed qpos correspond to different modes located at different radii .",
    "the frequencies of these modes depend on the black hole spin and the speed of sound in the accreted gas , and scale as @xmath11 .",
    "the mass ranges implied by combinations of the fundamental discoseismic modes overlap with those observationally determined only for the model relating the 3:2 qpos to the c - mode ( corrugation vertically incompressible waves near the inner edge of the disk ) and g - mode ( inertial - gravity waves that occur at the radius where @xmath12 reaches its maximum value ) provided that @xmath13 .",
    "details and references are given in @xcite .",
    "the internal ( epicyclic ) resonance and the discoseismic model ( dealing with c- and g- modes ) are favoured in the case of grs  1915@xmath1105 provided that @xmath2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the td , wd , rp , and rp2 models are disfavoured .",
    "this statement was inferred assuming that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 were the exact geodesic frequencies .",
    "analysis including the influence of non - geodesic effects would require a very detailed study .",
    "a rough estimate of their possible relevance can be done assuming the relative non - geodesic correction @xmath17 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trk et  al . , 2011 ) ) , which is needed to match the observations of grs  1915@xmath1105 with a given model for a certain spin . for @xmath18 and the rp model , it changes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the same is roughly true for the td and wd models , while for the rp2 model the required correction is even higher .",
    "thus , the above result is justified , except when very large non - geodesic corrections are taken into account .",
    "only the rp1 model can survive with corrections of @xmath21 up to @xmath22 , but the present physical interpretation of this model is unclear ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trk et  al . , 2011 ) for references ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that since the 3:2 qpo frequencies in microquasars scale roughly as @xmath23 , their spins implied by a given resonance model should not much vary among them",
    ". if very different spins in grs  1915@xmath1105 , gro  j1655@xmath2440 and xte  j1550@xmath24564 were confirmed , the difficulty of matching all the observed 3:2 frequencies would clearly be rather generic for most of the orbital qpo models .",
    "because of the generic @xmath11 scaling , the above difficulty also arises for a unified 3:2 qpo model assuming fundamental discoseismic modes . +   + * acknowledgements .",
