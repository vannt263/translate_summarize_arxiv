    "cosymplectic manifolds were introduced in the frame of quasi - sasakian manifolds by blair in @xcite as the closest odd - dimensional counterpart of khler manifolds . since",
    "then cosymplectic geometry has attracted the interest of many researchers also due to its role in mechanics and physics .",
    "recently , a great deal of work on the topological properties of cosymplectic manifolds was done ( see @xcite among others ) . in particular , in @xcite chinea , de len and marrero proved several important results for the betti numbers of a compact cosymplectic manifold .    the notion of @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold is the transposition of the notion of cosymplectic manifold to the setting of @xmath0-structures .",
    "namely , a @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold is a smooth manifold endowed with three distinct cosymplectic structures related to each other by means of some relations formally similar to the quaternionic identities ( see section  [ preliminaries ] for more details ) .",
    "this note contains a concise review of the main properties of @xmath0-cosymplectic manifolds , recently obtained by the authors in @xcite .",
    "especially , we emphasize our results concerning betti numbers of compact @xmath0-cosymplectic manifolds .",
    "finally , we present a method for constructing non - trivial examples of such compact manifolds .",
    "an _ almost contact manifold _ is an odd - dimensional smooth manifold @xmath1 endowed with a tensor field @xmath2 of endomorphisms on the tangent spaces , a vector field @xmath3 and a @xmath4-form @xmath5 satisfying  @xmath6 ,  where @xmath7 denotes the identity mapping of @xmath8 .",
    "it is known that there exists a riemannian metric @xmath9 which is compatible with the structure , in the sense that @xmath10 for any @xmath11 .",
    "when one fixes one compatible metric , the resulting geometric structure @xmath12 is called an _ almost contact metric structure _ on @xmath1 . from it",
    "follows that the bilinear form @xmath13 is in fact a @xmath14-form , called the _ fundamental @xmath14-form _ of the almost contact metric manifold .",
    "an _ almost cosymplectic manifold _ is an almost contact metric manifold @xmath15 such that both the @xmath4-form @xmath5 and the fundamental @xmath14-form @xmath16 are closed . if in addition the structure is _ normal _ , that is , if the nijenhuis tensor field of @xmath2 vanishes identically , @xmath15 is said to be a _",
    "cosymplectic manifold_. in terms of the covariant derivative of the structure tensor field @xmath2 , this condition is equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "now , we come to the main topic of the paper . a triple of almost contact structures @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 on a manifold @xmath1 , related by the identities @xmath21 for any even permutation @xmath22 of the set @xmath23 , is called an _ almost contact 3-structure _ on @xmath1",
    ". then , the dimension of the manifold is necessarily of the form @xmath24 .",
    "this notion was introduced independently by kuo ( @xcite ) and udriste ( @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", kuo proved that one can always find a riemannian metric @xmath9 which is compatible with each almost contact structure .",
    "if we fix a compatible metric , we speak of _ almost contact metric 3-structure_. any smooth manifold endowed with an almost contact metric @xmath0-structure carries two orthogonal distributions : the _ reeb distribution _ @xmath25 and the _ horizontal distribution _ @xmath26 .",
    "a remarkable case is when each structure is cosymplectic . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a _",
    "3-cosymplectic manifold_. in any @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold the forms @xmath27 and @xmath28 are harmonic .",
    "moreover , the tensors @xmath29 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , @xmath28 are all @xmath31-parallel . in particular",
    ", since the reeb vector fields commute with each other , it follows that the reeb distribution is integrable and defines a @xmath0-dimensional foliation @xmath32 of @xmath1 . as it was proven in @xcite",
    ", @xmath32 is a riemannian and transversely hyper - khler foliation with totally geodesic leaves .",
    "moreover , since @xmath33 , also the horizontal distribution @xmath34 is integrable and hence defines a riemannian , totally geodesic foliation complementary to @xmath35 .",
    "another important property of @xmath0-cosymplectic manifolds that should be mentioned is that they are ricci - flat ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold of dimension @xmath24 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath36 the usual de rham cohomology of @xmath1 . by the hodge - de rham theory each vector space @xmath37",
    "can be identified with the vector space @xmath38 of harmonic @xmath39-forms on @xmath1 .",
    "recall also that the space of basic @xmath39-forms ( with respect to @xmath35 ) is defined by @xmath40 since the differential @xmath41 preserves basic forms , it induces a cohomology @xmath42 which is called _",
    "basic cohomology_.    for each @xmath43 we define two linear operators @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath48 . by (",
    "* proposition 1 ) the operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and hence @xmath51 , preserve harmonic forms",
    ". then one can prove the following decomposition @xmath52 where we have put , for each triple @xmath53 , @xmath54 moreover , one can prove that the operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 induce isomorphisms between the vector spaces @xmath58 according to the following diagram @xmath59^{l_2 } \\ar[dd]^(.3){l_3}|!{[dl];[dr]}\\hole & & \\omega^{k+2}_{h,110 } \\left ( m \\right ) \\ar[dd]_{l_3}\\\\ \\omega^k_{h,000}\\left ( m \\right ) \\ar[rr]^(.7){l_2}\\ar[dd]_{l_3}\\ar[ru]^{l_1 } & & \\omega^{k+1}_{h,010}\\left ( m \\right)\\ar[dd]^(.7){l_3 } \\ar[ru]^{l_1}\\\\ & \\omega^{k+2}_{h,101}\\left ( m \\right ) { \\ar[rr]^(.4){l_2}|!{[dr];[ur]}\\hole }    & & \\omega^{k+3}_{h,111}\\left ( m \\right)\\\\ \\omega^{k+1}_{h,001}\\left ( m \\right ) \\ar[rr]^{l_2}\\ar[ru]^{l_1 } & & \\omega^{k+2}_{h,011}\\left ( m \\right ) \\ar[ru]_{l_1 } } \\ ] ] for each @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the whole information about cohomology groups of @xmath1 is contained in the vector spaces @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath61 can be identified with the space of basic harmonic @xmath39-forms on @xmath1 ( with respect to @xmath63 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath64 is the @xmath39-th basic betti number .",
    "now , taking the decomposition into account and using the above isomorphisms between the vector spaces @xmath65 , one gets the following formula for the @xmath39-th betti number of @xmath1 @xmath66 on the other hand , one can prove ( see @xcite for more details ) that , for each odd integer @xmath39 , @xmath67 is a @xmath68-module and thus @xmath69 is divisible by @xmath70 . then by it follows that",
    ", for any odd integer @xmath39 , @xmath71 is divisible by @xmath70 .",
    "another restriction on the betti numbers of a compact 3-cosymplectic manifold is the following inequality @xmath72 for @xmath73 , which is stronger than the analogous inequality for hyper - khler manifolds , due to wakakuwa ( @xcite ) , namely @xmath74 .",
    "we conclude the section by describing an action of the lie algebra @xmath75 on @xmath67 . for",
    "every even permutation @xmath22 of @xmath76 let us consider the @xmath14-form @xmath77 .",
    "then we define the operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath82 and @xmath83 preserve harmonicity , one can consider them as endomorphisms of @xmath84 .",
    "then , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.3 ) one has that , on @xmath85 , @xmath86=-h$ ] , where @xmath87 is the operator defined by @xmath88 . moreover",
    ", for each @xmath89 we define another operator @xmath90 on @xmath67 by @xmath91 $ ] , where @xmath22 is an even permutation of @xmath76",
    ". then we have the following result .",
    "the linear span @xmath92 of the operators @xmath93 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath90 , @xmath43 , is a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath75 .",
    "consequently @xmath84 is an @xmath75-module .",
    "the standard example of @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold is @xmath94 with the almost contact metric @xmath0-structure described in @xcite in terms of darboux coordinates .",
    "since this structure is invariant by translations , we get a @xmath0-cosymplectic structure on the flat torus @xmath95 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "both these examples are global products of a hyper - khler manifold with an abelian lie group .",
    "in fact , locally this is always true : every @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold is locally a riemannian product of a hyper - khler factor with a @xmath0-dimensional flat abelian lie group .",
    "thus it makes sense to ask whether there are examples of @xmath0-cosymplectic manifolds which are not global products of a hyper - khler manifold with a @xmath0-dimensional lie group . the answer to",
    "this question is affirmative and now we describe a procedure for constructing such examples .",
    "let @xmath96 be a compact hyper - khler manifold and @xmath97 a hyper - khler isometry on it .",
    "we define an action @xmath98 of @xmath99 on @xmath100 by @xmath101 we define a @xmath0-cosymplectic structure on the orbit space @xmath102 in the following way .",
    "let us consider the vector fields @xmath103 and the @xmath4-forms @xmath104 on @xmath105 .",
    "next we define , for each @xmath43 , a tensor field @xmath30 on @xmath100 by putting @xmath106 for any @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes the sign of the permutation @xmath22 of @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath111 , where @xmath9 denotes the product metric , is a @xmath0-cosymplectic structure on @xmath100 .",
    "being invariant under the action @xmath98 , the structure @xmath111 descends to a @xmath0-cosymplectic structure on @xmath112 . by using this general procedure",
    "we can construct non - trivial examples of compact @xmath0-cosymplectic manifolds .",
    "in fact , let us consider the hyper - khler manifold @xmath113 and the hyper - khler isometry @xmath97 given by the multiplication by the quaternionic unit @xmath114 on the right .",
    "then @xmath115 , endowed with the geometric structure described above , is a compact @xmath0-cosymplectic manifold which is not the global product of a compact @xmath70-dimensional hyper - khler manifold @xmath116 with the flat torus .",
    "indeed , we have only two possibilities for a compact @xmath70-dimensional hyper - khler manifold : either @xmath117 or it is a complex k3-surface . in the first case @xmath118 , in the second @xmath119 . however , in @xcite it was proven that @xmath120 .",
    "other examples can be obtained from the previous ones by applying a _",
    "@xmath121-homothetic deformation _ , that is a change of the structure tensors of the following type @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this notion was introduced by tanno ( @xcite ) in the contact metric case , but it can be easily extended to the more general context of almost contact metric structures . in particular",
    ", it can be proved that the class of cosymplectic structures is preserved by @xmath124-homothetic deformations .",
    "now , let @xmath125 , @xmath43 , be a 3-cosymplectic manifold .",
    "then by applying the same @xmath121-homothetic deformation to each cosymplectic structure @xmath126 , one obtains three new cosymplectic structures @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , which are still related to each other by means of the quaternionic - like relations .",
    "thus @xmath130 , @xmath43 , is a new 3-cosymplectic structure on @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", this procedure allows to define other @xmath0-cosymplectic structures on @xmath112 from the structure described before .",
    "we conclude with the following remark concerning the existence of @xmath0-cosymplectic structures on almost cosymplectic einstein manifolds . in the context of sasakian manifolds , apostolov , draghici and moroianu",
    "proved the following theorem :    [ goldberg ] let @xmath15 be a sasakian einstein manifold .",
    "then any contact metric structure @xmath131 on @xmath1 , with the same metric @xmath9 is sasakian . moreover , if @xmath132 , then either @xmath133 admits a 3-sasakian structure or @xmath133 is covered by a round sphere .    it could be interesting to investigate on the cosymplectic counterpart , if any , of theorem [ goldberg ] .",
    "in fact , this would permit to construct new examples of 3-cosymplectic manifolds . in this context",
    "we mention the following result on compact einstein cosymplectic manifolds .",
    "every compact einstein almost cosymplectic manifold @xmath15 , such that @xmath3 is killing , is cosymplectic and ricci - flat . furthermore , any other almost cosymplectic structure @xmath131 on @xmath1 is necessarily cosymplectic and ricci - flat ."
