    "<S> , doubly occupied sites can be interpreted as occupied by `` doublon '' quasi - particles . </S>",

    "<S> we have shown the lda to be quite accurate for a similar 2d system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is the only unknown parameter in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we plot the lda results for a set of initial temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data have been corrected by a systematic offset between @xmath53 and @xmath54 which is known to occur due to imperfections in the preparation of the initial spin mixture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable agreement is obtained for temperatures around @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the further experimental uncertainties in the particle number and the lattice depth to only add uncertainty to the doublon generation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> since the lattice modulation frequency equals the hubbard repulsion @xmath56 , particles are resonantly excited from the lower to upper hubbard band during the lattice modulation . </S>",

    "<S> _ amplitude effects . _    , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation amplitude is either 25% or 50% , as specified for each graph . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the effect of the amplitude @xmath60 in more detail for a half - filled system . in order to prevent inter - band transitions from becoming important , </S>",

    "<S> we have plotted the lattice depth @xmath45 , the normalized hopping @xmath62 , and the double occupancy @xmath63 as a function of time for a deeper lattice at two strong values of the lattice modulation amplitude in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nonlinear ] for a homogeneous system at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> as the amplitude is raised , the non - linear relationship between the hopping and the lattice depth results in a periodically kicked rather than a periodically driven system ( due to @xmath62 becoming very small for deep lattices ) . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the double occupancy is increased stepwise within each modulation cycle . </S>",
    "<S> again , we observe both , excitation and de - excitation processes in the double occupancy data . within the first modulation cycle , </S>",
    "<S> we observe the former and the latter to coincide with the decreasing and increasing regimes of @xmath62 , respectively . within modulation cycles </S>",
    "<S> further out in time , the stepwise increase in double occupancy starts already when @xmath62 is still rising . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that between the spikes in @xmath62 , the hopping is effectively zero , so that the system oscillates internally with frequency @xmath64 within the four - level hilbert space associated with a single lattice site . becomes slightly smaller than @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in @xmath66 is much smaller than that of @xmath67 , when the amplitude of the modulation is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when in units of @xmath69 , @xmath67 varies by more than a @xmath70 , since it is nearly completely suppressed when @xmath45 is large and increased by up to @xmath71 when @xmath45 is small , while @xmath66 varies by only @xmath72 of @xmath65 . ] as a consequence , there is a constructive interference of the immediate effect of lattice modulation and the internal oscillation , once the latter is fully engaged .    </S>",

    "<S> is observed in the resonant case @xmath38 . as the end time @xmath75 of the modulation is exceeded </S>",
    "<S> , the system continues oscillating with the internal frequency @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> a significant increase in double occupancy is also observed in the case @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this case also the system continues oscillating with @xmath65 after modulation , but with a smaller amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> for the off - resonant frequencies @xmath77 and @xmath78 , some intermediate excitations to the upper hubbard band show up but ( partially ) annihilate after a while . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of internal oscillations after the modulation is turned off appears to grow with the total increase in double occupancy reached when the modulation ends .    to provide a further overview of the frequency and amplitude dependence , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : freqdep ] shows the final value of the double occupancy , i.e. the value averaged over one oscillation cycle @xmath79 $ ] , vs. the frequency for different amplitudes as a doublon production `` spectroscopy '' .     and [ fig : timedepresonances ] . ]    evidently </S>",
    "<S> , a second - order resonance is observed at the frequency @xmath80 , which is suppressed as the amplitude is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> it can be interpreted as a coherent excitation involving the nonlinear combination of two smaller quanta of energy @xmath81 , i.e. an analogue to two - photon excitations in quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect has already been observed experimentally in a bosonic system.@xcite as a consequence of the combination of these two quanta , the width of the second - order peak is approximately half of the width of the first - order peak . </S>",
    "<S> also note that both peaks are shifted towards slightly smaller frequencies due to the finite width of the hubbard bands . </S>",
    "<S> lower - energy excitations are possible by exciting from the upper edge of the lower hubbard band to the lower edge of upper hubbard band .    whereas the @xmath81 peak is clearly visible for very large modulation amplitudes , the rather isolated time evolution of lattice sites between the kicks in @xmath62 presumably suppresses its amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is inherent to modulation spectroscopy due to the nonlinearity of the map @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> its presence could be possibly enhanced by designing @xmath45 in such a way that a harmonic shape is obtained for @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have studied finite - amplitude lattice depth modulation spectroscopy of ultracold fermionic atoms in the mott - insulating phase using a recently developed strong - coupling method @xcite in the lda . in order to validate the theory , </S>",
    "<S> we have compared to experimental data and found good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> only the temperature of the initial thermal state was unknown in the experiment and had to be determined _ a posteriori_. we furthermore analyzed higher amplitudes of the modulation strength for deeper lattices . </S>",
    "<S> a large value of the amplitude results in a pulsed , rather than a driven system , in terms of the time - dependence of the hopping . </S>",
    "<S> this causes step - shaped changes in the double occupancy , accompanied by oscillations with frequency @xmath83 of the local degrees of freedom on a single lattice site . at a certain threshold in amplitude , </S>",
    "<S> a second `` nonlinear '' peak in the doublon production rate appears at @xmath84 . </S>"
