    "current cosmological observations , such as the cmb measurements of temperature anisotropies and polarization at high redshift @xmath4 @xcite and the redshift - distance measurements of snia at @xmath5 @xcite , have demonstrated that the universe is now undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion .",
    "the simplest explanation is that this behavior is driven by the cosmological constant or the dynamical dark energy models , which suffers from the severe coincidence and fine - tuning problems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this observed late - time acceleration of the expansion on the large scales could also be caused by some modifications of general relativity , such as the scalar - tensor @xcite and @xmath6 theories @xcite , and gravitational slip @xcite .",
    "one of the well - known examples is the dgp braneworld model @xcite , in which the gravity leaks off the four dimensional brane into the five dimensional space - time . on small scales gravity",
    "is bound to the four dimensional brane and the general relativity is recovered to a good approximation . in the framework of flat dgp model , the friedmann equation will be modified as @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the crossover scale . at early times ,",
    "@xmath9 , the friedmann equation of general relativity is recovered , while in the future , @xmath10 , the expansion is asymptotically de sitter .",
    "recently there have been a lot of interests in the phenomenological studies relevant to the dgp model in the literature @xcite .    in this note",
    "we investigate an interesting phenomenological model , first introduced in ref.@xcite , which interpolates between the pure @xmath0cdm model and the dgp model with an additional parameter @xmath1 and presents the tight constraints from the current observations and future measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the general formalism of the modified gravity model . sec .",
    "iii contains the current observations we use , and sec .",
    "iv includes our main global fitting results . in sec .",
    "v we present the forecasts from the future measurements , while sec .",
    "vi is dedicated the conclusions .",
    "in this phenomenological model , assuming the flatness of our universe , the friedmann equation is modified as @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . thus , we can straightforwardly rewrite the above equation and obtain the expansion rate as following : @xmath13 where the last term denotes the modification of the friedmann equation of general relativity : @xmath14 furthermore , we can obtain the effective equation of state : @xmath15 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath16 .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we illustrate the evolutions of the effective energy density @xmath17 and @xmath18 for different values of parameter @xmath1 . during the matter dominated era , @xmath19 varies as @xmath20 , which corresponds to the effective equation of state : @xmath21 . in the future @xmath22 , with the matter density @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 .     and effective equation of state @xmath26 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the black solid lines are for @xmath27 ( @xmath0cdm ) , the red dashed lines for @xmath28 and the blue dotted lines for @xmath29 ( dgp ) .",
    "and the vertical line denotes today ( @xmath30).[fig1 ] ]    besides the modification of the friedmann equation , the flat dgp model also changes the growth function of density perturbation @xmath31 . under assumptions of a quasi - static regime and sub - horizon scales , the correct evolution of perturbation was found @xcite : @xmath32 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath33 , and the @xmath34 factor is given by : @xmath35 however , this phenomenological model eq.([mdgpeq ] ) is a parametrization , so the situation is more complicated .",
    "one of the possible methods was found by ref.@xcite . in order to obtain the growth function of density perturbation within a covariant theory ,",
    "the authors introduced a correction term and assumed the structure of modified theory of gravity to determine this term .",
    "based on those assumptions , it was consequently found that the @xmath34 factor was : @xmath36 in the following analysis , we will use eq.([groweq ] ) and eq.([beta ] ) to calculate the growth of density perturbation .    defined the normalized growth @xmath37 , the growth function eq.([groweq ] )",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath38\\frac{g}{a^2}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variable @xmath39 is the ratio of the matter density to the effective energy density @xmath40 . in fig.[fig2 ] we plot the linear growth factor @xmath41 as function of scale factor @xmath42 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "one can see that the linear growth factor has been suppressed obviously as long as @xmath1 is larger than zero .",
    "thus , in the literature the linear growth has been widely used to study the modified gravity models , especially the dgp model @xcite .     for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the black solid lines are for @xmath27 ( @xmath0cdm ) , the red dashed lines for @xmath28 and the blue dotted lines for @xmath29 ( dgp).[fig2 ] ]    furthermore , the growth factor can be parameterized as @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the growth index .",
    "and then the growth function becomes : @xmath45 for the pure @xmath0cdm model , the theoretical value of @xmath44 is @xmath46 , while @xmath47 in the flat dgp model @xcite .    in the framework of this phenomenological model",
    ", we can easily see that the pure @xmath0cdm model and flat dgp model can be recovered when @xmath27 and @xmath29 , respectively . in order to be consistent with the cosmological observations",
    ", the @xmath1 term should be very small in the early times , such as the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) era ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the upper bound : @xmath49 @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath50 , the effective equation of state will become smaller than @xmath51 , which leads to the instability of linear growth of density perturbation due to the appearance of @xmath34 term eq.([beta ] ) .",
    "term @xmath52 when fixing @xmath53.[fig3 ] ]    at early times , such as the matter dominated era , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 . thus , eq.([beta ] ) becomes @xmath56 since @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "by contrast , at late times the matter energy density @xmath23 and the expansion is asymptotically de sitter , @xmath59 .",
    "and then we have @xmath60 based on eq.([beta+ ] ) and eq.([beta- ] ) , we can straightforwardly see that as long as @xmath50 , during the evolution of universe the value of @xmath34 should change the sign at one pivot redshift @xmath61 , which leads to @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we have shown the evolution of @xmath52 when fixing @xmath53 .",
    "there is an obvious singularity at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , based on these discussions above , we use a tophat prior on @xmath1 as @xmath65 in our calculations .",
    "in our calculations we assume a flat space and use a uniform prior on the present matter density fraction of the universe : @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , we constrain the hubble parameter to be uniformly in @xmath67 hubble space telescope ( hst ) region : @xmath68 . the resulting plots are produced with cosmologui .    in this section",
    "we will list the cosmological observations used in our calculations : cmb , bao and snia measurements , as well as some high - redshift observations , such as the grb and lgf data .",
    "we have taken the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods ( @xmath69 ) of these cosmological probes .",
    "in other words , defining @xmath70 , we get : @xmath71 if the likelihood function is gaussian , @xmath72 coincides with the usual definition of @xmath73 up to an additive constant corresponding to the logarithm of the normalization factor of @xmath74 .",
    "cmb measurement is sensitive to the distance to the decoupling epoch via the locations of peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations .",
    "here we use the  wmap distance information \" obtained by the wmap group @xcite , which includes the  shift parameter \" @xmath75 , the  acoustic scale \" @xmath76 , and the photon decoupling epoch @xmath77 into the wmap distance information .",
    "but our calculations are not sensitive to @xmath78 and they also claim that this extension does not affect the constraints .",
    "thus , we fix @xmath79 to be the best fit value obtained by the wmap group . ] .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to the ratio of angular diameter distance to the decoupling era over the hubble horizon and the sound horizon at decoupling , respectively , given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the comoving distance to @xmath77 and the comoving sound horizon at @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the decoupling epoch @xmath77 is given by @xcite : @xmath83[1+g_1(\\omega_m h^2)^{g_2}]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 we calculate the likelihood of the wmap distance information as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the parameter vector and @xmath87 is the inverse covariance matrix for the wmap distance information shown in table i.    table i. inverse covariance matrix for the wmap distance information @xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum likelihood values are @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      from the different current data combinations : cmb+bao+sn ( blue dashed lines ) and all real data ( red solid lines ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    in this section we present our main results of constraints on this phenomenological model from the current observational data , as shown in table iii .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we illustrate the posterior distribution of @xmath1 from the current data .",
    "firstly , we neglect the high redshift probes .",
    "the result shows that the current observations yield a strong constraint on the parameter : @xmath92 one can see that the pure @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath27 ) still fits data very well at @xmath93 uncertainty , which is consistent with the current status of global fitting results @xcite .",
    "and the @xmath94 upper limit is @xmath95 , which implies that there is a significant tension between the flat dgp model ( @xmath29 ) and the current observations , which is consistent with other works ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike other works @xcite , in our analysis we use the ",
    "wmap distance information \" which includes the  shift parameter \" @xmath75 , the  acoustic scale \" @xmath76 , and the photon decoupling epoch @xmath77 , instead of @xmath75 only , to constrain this phenomenological model .",
    "recently , many results show that the  wmap distance information \" can give the similar constraints , when compared with the results from the full cmb power spectrum @xcite . by contrast",
    ", @xmath75 could not be an accurate substitute for the full cmb data and may in principle give some misleading results @xcite .",
    "and then , we include some high redshift probes , such as grb and lgf data sets . from table iii and fig.[fig4",
    "] , we can find that the constraint on @xmath1 becomes slightly tighter : @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath93 confidence level . as we have mentioned before ,",
    "the effective equation of state of this phenomenological model will depart from the cosmological constant boundary at high redshifts .",
    "therefore , these high redshift observations are helpful to improve the constraints on this phenomenological model .    these results ( eqs.([result1]-[result2 ] ) )",
    "are not surprising . from fig.[fig1 ] we find that the effective equation of state of the flat dgp model , @xmath98 , will depart from the cosmological constant @xmath99 at high - redshift universe significantly .",
    "but the current constraint on @xmath100 is closed to @xmath99 @xcite , so we require the small value of @xmath1 to match the current observations .",
    "there is a small difference that our result slightly favors a non - zero value of @xmath1 , but not significantly , which needs more accurate measurements to verify it further .    in fig.[fig5",
    "] we plot the two dimensional constraint in the ( @xmath101,@xmath1 ) panel . @xmath101 and @xmath1 are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the reason of this degeneracy is that the constraint mainly comes from the luminosity and angular diameter distance information . from eq.([ez ] ) and eq.([deltah ] ) we can see that when @xmath1 is increased , the contribution of last @xmath1 term to the expansion rate will become large , due to the positive @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , @xmath101 must be decreased correspondingly in order to produce the same expansion rate .",
    "when combining those current observational data , the matter energy density has been constrained very stringent : @xmath102 , which is also consistent with the current status of global fitting results @xcite .",
    "naturally , the constraint on @xmath1 will also be improved , because of the tight constraint on the matter energy density .     and @xmath94 constraints in the ( @xmath101,@xmath1 ) plane from the current observations.[fig5 ] ]",
    "furthermore , we also investigate the limit on the growth index @xmath44 and obtain @xmath103 at @xmath3 confidence level .",
    "obviously , the growth index of the pure @xmath0cdm @xmath104 is consistent with this result .",
    "however , the theoretical value of growth index in the flat dgp model , @xmath47 , is disfavored .",
    "since the present data clearly do not give very stringent constraint on the parameter @xmath1 , it is worthwhile to discuss whether future data could determine @xmath1 conclusively .",
    "for that purpose we have performed an analysis and chosen the fiducial model as the mean values of table iii obtained from the current constraints .",
    "the projected satellite snap ( supernova / acceleration probe ) would be a space based telescope with a one square degree field of view with @xmath105 pixels .",
    "it aims to increase the discovery rate for snia to about @xmath106 per year in the redshift range @xmath107 . in this paper",
    "we simulate about @xmath106 snia according to the forecast distribution of the snap @xcite . for the error",
    ", we follow the ref.@xcite which takes the magnitude dispersion @xmath108 and the systematic error @xmath109 . the whole error for each data",
    "is given by : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of supernovae of the @xmath112th redshift bin .",
    "furthermore , we add as an external data set a mock dataset of 400 grbs , in the redshift range @xmath113 with an intrinsic dispersion in the distance modulus of @xmath114 and with a redshift distribution very similar to that of figure 1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "and @xmath94 constraints in the ( @xmath101,@xmath1 ) plane from the future measurements.[fig6 ] ]    for the linear growth factors data , we simulate the mock data from the fiducial model with the error bars reduced by a factor of two .",
    "this is probably reasonable given the larger amounts of galaxy power spectrum and lyman-@xmath1 forest power spectrum data that will become available soon as long with a better control of systematic errors in the next generated large scale structure survey .",
    "in addition we also assume a gaussian prior on the matter energy density @xmath101 as @xmath115 , which is close to future planck constraints @xcite .    from table iii it is clear that the future measurements with higher precision could improve the constraints dramatically .",
    "the standard derivation of @xmath1 is reduced by a factor two . assuming the mean value remains unchanged in the future",
    ", the non - zero value of @xmath1 will be confirmed around @xmath116 confidence level by the future measurements .",
    "in addition we also illustrate the two dimensional contour of parameters @xmath101 and @xmath1 in fig.[fig6 ] . comparing with the contour in fig.[fig5 ] ,",
    "the allowed parameter region has been shrunk significantly .",
    "the future measurements could have enough ability to distinguish between the modified gravity model and the pure @xmath0cdm model .",
    "as an alternative approach to generate the late - time acceleration of the expansion of our universe , models of modifications of gravity have attracted a lot of interests in the phenomenological studies recently . in this note we investigate an interesting phenomenological model which interpolates between the pure @xmath0cdm model and the flat dgp braneworld model with an additional parameter @xmath1 .",
    "firstly , we find that when @xmath1 is less than zero , the growth function of density perturbation @xmath31 will appear an apparent singularity .",
    "this is because the variable @xmath34 will change the sign during the evolution of our universe .",
    "and then the @xmath34 term caused by the modified gravity model will be divergent at some redshift @xmath61 .    from the current cmb , bao and snia data , we obtain a tight constraint on the parameter @xmath117 , which implies that the flat dgp model ( @xmath29 ) is incompatible with the current observations , while the pure @xmath0cdm model still fits the data very well . when adding the high - redshift grb and lgf data , the constraint is more stringent @xmath118 , which means that these high redshift observations are helpful to improve the constraints on this phenomenological model .",
    "finally , we simulate the future measurements with higher precisions to limit this phenomenological model .",
    "and we find that these accurate probes will be helpful to improve the constraints on the parameters of the model and could distinguish between the modified gravity model and the pure @xmath0cdm model .",
