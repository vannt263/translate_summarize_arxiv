    "in the modern cosmology , a ` dark energy ' ( de ) with negative pressure is suggested to be responsible for the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "the simplest candidate of de is the cosmological constant , which does nicely well at the pragmatic observational level , but entails the serious theoretical difficultly : the cosmological constant problem and the coincidence problem .",
    "explanations of de have been sought within a wide range of physical phenomena , including some exotic fields , modified gravity theories , and so on -see @xcite and references therein . among the most recent generic proposals ,",
    "the model inspired by the holographic idea @xcite , that the quantum zero - point energy of a system can not exceed the mass of a black hole with same size , has been put forward to explain the de @xcite .",
    "this de density can be determined in terms of the horizon radius of the universe , corresponding to relate the uv cutoff of a system to its ir cutoff in the quantum field theory .",
    "there are usually three choices for the horizon radius supposed to provide the ir cutoff , with different degrees of success , namely the hubble horizon , the particle horizon , and the future event horizon .",
    "the event horizon may be better , since in this case the de can drive the present accelerated expansion and the coincidence problem can be resolved by assuming an appropriate number of e - folding of inflation @xcite .",
    "most discussions on de models rely on the fact that both dark matter ( dm ) and de only couple gravitationally .",
    "however , given their unknown nature and the symmetry that would impose a vanishing interaction is still to be discovered , an entirely independent behavior between dark sectors is very special .",
    "moreover , since de must be accreted by massive compact objects like black holes and neutron stars , in a cosmological context the energy transfer from de to dm may be small but must be non - vanishing .",
    "the interaction hypothesis was first introduced by wetterich @xcite to discuss the cosmological constant problem in the light of dilatation symmetry and its anomaly .",
    "then cosmological consequences of a scalar field coupled to the matter were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the coupling quintessence models may give the scaling attractors providing an accelerated expansion at the present time and alleviate the coincidence problem amendola2 .",
    "the interaction also appears in the context of modified gravity models @xcite .",
    "more possibility that de and dm can interact has been studied in @xcite . confronted to cosmological data , it was found that an appropriate interaction can influence the perturbation dynamics , and the lowest multipoles of the cmb spectrum @xcite , and could be inferred from the expansion history of the universe , as manifested in the supernova data together with cmb and large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was suggested that the dynamical equilibrium of collapsed structures would be affected by the coupling of de to dm @xcite .",
    "the interaction was first connected to holography by horvat @xcite who argued that scaling of the cosmological constant stemming from the zero - point energy in quantum field theory possibly implies a non - vanishing coupling of the cosmological constant with dm . in the holographic de model with the hubble horizon as the ir cutoff",
    ", the interaction can be available to derive the present accelerated expansion and alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite . in the interacting model with the event horizon as the ir cutoff , it was shown that the equation of state ( eos ) of de can accommodate the dynamically evolving behavior of crossing the phantom divide @xcite , which suggested by recent most observational probes wangy .",
    "although the interaction is important in studying the physics of de , it will not be possible to derive the precise form of the interaction from first principles unless the nature of both dark sectors was known .",
    "usually , the coupling is determined from phenomenological requirements amendola2,pavon2 . in view of the continuous equations of de density @xmath0 and dm density @xmath1",
    ", the coupling @xmath2 must be a function of densities multiplied by a quantity with units of inverse of time , which has an obvious choice as hubble time @xmath3 .",
    "thus , one may write the coupling as@xmath4which leads @xmath5 from the first order terms in the power law expansion .",
    "assuming that the ratio @xmath6 might be piecewise constant , the linear parameters are usually set to @xmath7 and even @xmath8 or @xmath9 for simplicity . considering the couplings",
    "are terms in the lagrangian which mix both de and dm , one may further suppose that they could be parameterized by some product of the densities of de and dm , such as the simplest @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "besides these phenomenological descriptions , various proposals at the fundamental level have been tried to account for the coupling , including the dependence of the matter field on the scalar field @xcite or expressing the cosmological constant as a function of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting thermodynamical description of interaction between holographic de and dm has been proposed in @xcite , where it was assumed that in the absence of the coupling the de and dm remain in separate thermal equilibrium , then a small interaction can be viewed as a stable thermal fluctuation that brings a logarithmic correction to the equilibrium entropy of de and dm . other specific coupling which was assumed from the outset can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this work is to reconstruct the coupling using the recent de probes ( the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement at @xmath11 from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and the re - compiled 192 type ia supernovae ( snia ) samples @xcite , consisting 60 points from essence ( equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion ) supernova survey @xcite , 57 points from supernovae legacy survey @xcite , 45 points nearby supernovae riess , and 30 points detected by the hubble space telescope @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus on the holographic de model and choose the future event horizon as the ir cutoff .",
    "the model with the hubble horizon has been studied recently in @xcite and it was found that the reconstructed interaction is always positive in 1@xmath12 region .",
    "this seems to corroborate the recent argument that the negative interaction violates the second law of thermodynamics which inquires the energy transfer from de to dm rather than otherwise pavon1 .",
    "however , it should be noticed that there are some problems in the thermodynamics of de , such as the negative entropy @xcite , and the generalized thermodynamical second law indeed breaks down in the universe with phantom - dominated de @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that one should consider the thermodynamical properties of de with wide possibilities .",
    "hence , it is interesting to see whether the positive interaction is a robust result for other models , such as the present model with the ir cutoff as the future event horizon .",
    "considering the time varying de gives a better fit than a cosmological constant and in particular most of the observational probes indeed mildly favor dynamical de crossing the phantom divide at @xmath13 @xcite , we will employ two commonly used parameterizations jassal , feng , chevallier , linder , namely@xmath14which has been used in @xcite , and@xmath15it should be noticed that the different parameterizations are beneficial to control some amount of parameterization dependence . after reconstructing the interaction , we will further compare it with the usual phenomenological models and the recent thermodynamical description .",
    "let us begin with the friedmann equations@xmath16@xmath17where we have normalized @xmath18 for conventions . the total energy density @xmath19 satisfies a conservation law .",
    "however , since we consider the interaction between de and dm , @xmath1 and @xmath0 do not satisfy independent conservation laws , they instead satisfy two continuous equations@xmath20@xmath21where @xmath22 is the eos of de , and @xmath2 denotes the interaction term . without loss of generality , we will write the interaction as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an unknown function .    using the the ratio of energy densities @xmath25 , we have@xmath26from eq . ( [ h2 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ rom ] ) , we have@xmath27which can be recast as @xmath28from eq . ( [ rod ] ) . eliminating the @xmath24 in above two equations , we obtain@xmath29 until now , we have not specified the concrete de density .",
    "we will focus on the holographic de model .",
    "followed @xcite by choosing the future event horizon@xmath30as the ir cutoff , the holographic de density is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant and the planck mass has been taken as unit .",
    "the most possible theoretical value of @xmath33 is one @xcite , indicating that the total energy from de must be determined by the schwarzschild relation . taking the derivative with respect to @xmath34 ,",
    "the evolution of the horizon can be determined by@xmath35defining @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ rrot ] )",
    "can be recast as@xmath39obviously , @xmath40 is not a constant in general .",
    "this is different with the case in @xcite where @xmath40 is a constant since the ir cutoff was chosen as being the hubble scale . replacing the time @xmath34 as the redshift @xmath41",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rt ] ) as@xmath42where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) reads@xmath44it is interesting to find that eqs .",
    "( [ rz ] ) and ( [ hz ] ) determine the evolvement of @xmath40 and @xmath45 , if we know the eos @xmath22 . in the normal interacting de model , one assumes the explicit interaction form to give out @xmath46 . for our aim , we will use the two commonly used parameterizations of @xmath46 to determine the dynamics of our model , and reconstruct the interaction rate @xmath47@xmath48from the recent observational datasets",
    "we will use the re - compiled 192 snia samples ( @xmath49 ) combined with the recent bao measurement from sdss to reconstruct the interaction rate .",
    "there are other de observational probes , including the three - year wmap cmb shift parameter , the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters , the linear growth rate of perturbations at @xmath50 as obtained from the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and the look back age data .",
    "however , since the parameterizations of @xmath46 eqs .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) are motivated to accommodate the dynamically evolving behavior of crossing the phantom divide at recent epoch , and our model has not included the radiation and the baryonic matter which may be important in the early , we will not use the wmap cmb shift parameter which focuses on the high redshift region .",
    "besides , for simplicity , we do not adopt other probes of de which have large relative errors compared with snia , cmb , and bao probes @xcite .    as usually",
    ", we will fix dm density parameter as @xmath51  or @xmath52  to include the best - fit value of @xmath53  from 5-year wmap data .",
    "in general , they are sufficiently representative . moreover , it is convenient to compare our reconstructed interaction to the interaction reconstructed in @xcite where these two dm density parameters are used",
    ". we will consider five indicative different values of the constant @xmath33 near one .",
    "the best - fit values with 1@xmath54 error bars for the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given in table [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] .",
    ".the best fit values with 1@xmath57 error bars for the parameters of @xmath22 with dm density parameter @xmath58 @xmath59 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can find that the phantom divide crossing in recent epoch is always permitted in 1@xmath54 region .",
    "the deceleration parameter with these best - fit equation of states is plotted in fig .",
    "[ q ] ,    where the acceleration ( super - acceleration , at most cases ) in recent epoch is achieved .",
    "it is interesting to see that current deceleration parameter in interacting model is almost not affected by the de parameter @xmath33 , according to the almost same parameters @xmath60 in table [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] .",
    "we also show the evolution of @xmath1 compared its non - interacting version @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ roi ] .    the ratios change strongly in recent epoch which implies the interaction plays important role in that time .",
    "the correspnding plots for the dark energy component are given in fig .",
    "since the de density is always positive , this suggests that the interaction can be negative but can not be too negative when @xmath62 , which is possible at least in the past .    with these best - fit values",
    ", we reconstruct the interaction rates , see fig .",
    "[ int1 ] and fig .",
    "[ int2 ]    this is one of the main result of this paper .",
    "it should be stressed that the negative interaction is permitted in the wide region of fig .",
    "[ int1 ] and fig .",
    "this is contrast to the result in @xcite where the reconstructed interaction is always positive , and the argument that the second law of thermodynamics which imposes energy transfer from de to dm @xcite .",
    "if the second law is true , the permitted region of the interaction rates must be reduced , as done in @xcite .",
    "however , for generality and considering the thermodynamical properties of de is not clear , we will not restrict the interaction to be positive .",
    "moreover , the effective eos @xmath63  can be obtained since we have known @xmath22  and reconstructed the @xmath47 . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] , and fig .",
    "[ int1 ] , [ int2 ] , one can know that the effective eos may be bigger or smaller than @xmath64  for different parameters @xmath58  and @xmath33 . if one requires an effective phantom - like de , the presence of a coupling makes the parameters have more possible values than the case of absence of a coupling , where the eos is determined by @xmath65  which imposes @xmath66  for @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to have effective eos @xmath68  smaller than @xmath64  but @xmath22  bigger than @xmath69  when the interaction is negative .",
    "this suggests that the negative interaction is interesting because de with @xmath62  is easily accepted ( the scalar field with @xmath67  will break the zero energy condition . ) and the effective eos of de @xmath70  can fit the cosmological data better .",
    "in the following , we will compare the reconstructed interaction rate with other descriptions .",
    "let us begin with the usual phenomenological descriptions .",
    "usually there are four different choices of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , which can be expressed as @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively . to compare them with the reconstructed interaction rate @xmath47",
    ", we define four interaction rates @xmath77 , which can be determined by @xmath40 and @xmath78 ( which have been solved from eqs .",
    "( [ rz ] ) and ( [ hz ] ) ) , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . observing fig .",
    "[ int1 ] , the indicative curves of the usual interaction rates @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) show that in many cases they are not favored in 1@xmath54 region .",
    "for example , see the case of @xmath85 , where the interaction rates @xmath86 ( green line ) and @xmath87 ( blue line ) are permitted in 1@xmath54 region , but the other interaction rates @xmath88 ( red line ) and @xmath89 ( yellow line ) are not permitted whether @xmath90 increases or decreases . for the case",
    "@xmath91 , the reconstructed interaction rate changes at recent epoch from positive to negative .",
    "this tendency is more general in fig .",
    "[ int2 ] with small dm parameter @xmath92 @xmath59 .",
    "thus , one may suspect that the four phenomenological descriptions of the interaction which have the definitive sign may be not suitable .",
    "we will also consider the recent thermodynamical description of the interaction .",
    "defining @xmath93 , the thermodynamical interaction rate @xmath94 can be determined by following equations ( see @xcite in detail):@xmath95 + \\frac{1}{12\\pi c^{2}}\\frac{h^{2}}{c/% \\sqrt{\\omega _",
    "{ d}}\\left ( c/\\sqrt{\\omega _ { d}}-1\\right ) } \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega _ { d}}}{\\sqrt{\\omega _ { d}^{0}}}\\left ( -\\omega _ { d}^{0}\\right ) ^{\\prime } ( 1+z),\\]]@xmath96@xmath97where the zero superscript of @xmath98 and @xmath99 indicates absence of interaction",
    ". we can relate @xmath94 to a new interaction rate@xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ int1 ] and fig .",
    "[ int2 ] ( blue dashing lines ) , one can find that @xmath101 is almost not favored in 1@xmath54 region ( note we have not shown the cases with @xmath102 where @xmath94 has not the real solution and the parameterization of @xmath22 is not needed to determine @xmath101 since the eos in this model is determined by the @xmath94 . ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the reconstructed interaction can be described well by a more general interaction form .",
    "a natural candidate is to expand the phenomenological description ( [ q ] ) up to the second order , namely@xmath103with the interaction rate@xmath104we find that it indeed works well , see the red dashing line in fig .",
    "int1 and fig .",
    "however , this parameterization only has theoretical interest since it contains too many parameters .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations prove that this parameterization can not be reduced to include only the two first order terms , which has been studied recently in @xcite , if we need it being permitted in 1@xmath54 region for all cases .",
    "we have reconstructed the interaction term between the holographic de and dm , using the re - compiled 192 snia samples combined with the recent bao measurement .",
    "the de parameter @xmath33 is assumed near one .",
    "the two common used parameterizations of @xmath22 are considered in 1@xmath54 region .",
    "it is found that the present accelerated expansion of universe is achieved and the phantom behavior of de is permitted .",
    "we illustrate that the negative interaction is permitted in the wide region .",
    "hence , contrast to the de model studied in @xcite , where the reconstructed interaction is always positive in 1@xmath54 region , we can not obtain the favor from the dm observation for the recent argued thermodynamical second law which imposes the energy transfer from de to dm .",
    "this suggest us to keep wide possibilities of the thermodynamical properties of de .",
    "we show that the four usual phenomenological descriptions can not describe the reconstructed interaction well for many cases .",
    "specially for the case with small dm parameter @xmath58 @xmath59 , the interaction rate has a trend to change sign at recent epoch .",
    "this is at variance with the usual phenomenological interacting terms which have the definitive sign .",
    "we further illustrate that the recent thermodynamical description of the interaction is not favored .",
    "our work stimulates one to seek a more suitable interaction",
    ".    it would be interesting to confront our model to more observations , such as cmb angular power and large scale structure , which will further constrain the interaction rate and make clear if the negative interaction and phantom de are still to be permitted .",
    "another interesting work is to consider the perturbation evolution in our model .",
    "recently , it has been found that some types of interaction will lead to instability under the curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "it may provide some restrictions on the form of interaction .",
