    "herbig - haro ( hh ) objects , which trace shock - excited plasma , are signposts of the intense outflow phenomena associated with star formation ( e.g. ,   reipurth & bally @xcite ) .",
    "several hh objects are found to have associated quiescent dense clumps ahead of them : hh  1/2 ( see references below ) , hh  7 - 11 ( rudolph & welch @xcite ; dent et al .",
    "@xcite ; rudolph et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hh  34 ( rudolph & welch  @xcite ) , ngc  2264 g ( girart et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hh  80n ( girart  et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; girart , estalella & ho @xcite ) .",
    "most of them have high excitation knots , i.e. ,  with strong high excitation lines , such as [ oiii ] and h@xmath5 , strong uv lines and significant uv continuum radiation ( e.g. ,   reipurth & bally @xcite ) .",
    "the quiescent clumps are characterized by the low temperature and narrow line widths of the molecular emission , and by the emission enhancement of hco@xmath2  and nh@xmath3 . in spite of the presence of the hh objects ,",
    "there is a lack of apparent dynamical perturbation in the clumps .",
    "however , recent observations show clear signposts of star formation within the hh  80n clumps ( girart et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "girart et al .  ( @xcite ) suggested that the regions of enhanced hco@xmath2 and nh@xmath3 emission were a consequence of the irradiation from the hh shock affecting the chemistry within a small dense clump nearby in the molecular cloud .",
    "it was supposed that the uv radiation would evaporate icy mantles and promote photochemistry in the enriched gas .",
    "taylor & williams ( @xcite ) modeled this situation with a simple chemistry and showed that hco@xmath2 would arise from the interaction of c@xmath2 ( derived from co ) with h@xmath4o liberated from the ice .",
    "the chemical enhancements would be transient , but predicted column densities were significant .",
    "viti & williams ( @xcite , hereafter vw99 ) noted that the impact of a high radiation field on a dense gas should lead to a rich chemistry , and they therefore extended the 1996 model .",
    "they predicted that , in addition to hco@xmath2 and nh@xmath3 , a wide variety of species should arise with enhanced abundances , including ch@xmath3oh , h@xmath4co , so , so@xmath4 , and cn and that the effects in a single clump should last for @xmath6 years .",
    "raga & williams ( @xcite ) showed that the photochemical effects created by the hh object should respond to its movement through the molecular cloud , and predicted that the enhanced regions should have a characteristic morphology .",
    "@xmath7    @xmath8 @xmath9 is the fwhm line width    @xmath10 overlapped with the ns 11/2,11/29/2,9/2 transition    implicit in the model is the idea that molecular clouds are clumpy on a small scale .",
    "this was suggested by taylor , morata & williams ( @xcite ) as a necessary assumption to interpret the relative spatial distributions of cs and nh@xmath3 in molecular clouds in terms of time - dependent chemistry .",
    "the clumps were required to be transient on a timescale of about one million years .",
    "subsequent interferometer observations ( e.g. peng et al .",
    "@xcite , for tmc-1 core d ; morata , girart & estalella @xcite for l673 ) have supported the taylor et al .  model .",
    "therefore , the hh objects may be regarded as probes of the transient substructure of molecular clouds . wherever the probe encounters a small clump ,",
    "a characteristic chemistry arises .",
    "this paper reports a search for that characteristic chemistry in the clump associated with hh  2 .    the prototypical hh  1 and hh  2 objects ( herbig @xcite ; haro @xcite ) , located in the l1641n molecular cloud in orion , provided the earliest spectral evidence that the hh objects trace strong shocks due to the presence of stellar winds ( schwartz @xcite ) .",
    "both hh  1 and hh  2belong to the class of high excitation hh objects , with strong uv ( bhm et al .",
    "@xcite ; raymond , hartmann & hartigan @xcite ; raymond , blair & long @xcite ) and centimeter continuum emission ( rodrguez et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hh  2  shows a very complex and apparently chaotic morphological , kinematical and excitation structure ( e.g. ,  schwartz et al .",
    "@xcite ; eislffel et al .",
    "detailed hst observations reveal that this complex structure is the consequence of the interaction of the hh  2  jet with a dense ambient cloud , resulting in a very bright , high ionization and complex structure ( hester , stapelfeldt , & scowen @xcite ) .",
    "recent chandra observations reveal that the strongest hh  2  knot , which is also the highest excitation knot , has associated x - ray emission ( pravdo et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the presence of quiescent dense ambient gas ahead of hh  2  has been well established from hco@xmath2  and nh@xmath3  observations ( davis , dent & bell burnell @xcite ; torrelles et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; choi & zhou @xcite ) .",
    "the ammonia emission shows a clumpy medium , with clump sizes of only 20@xmath11 ( torrelles et al .",
    "@xcite ) or @xmath12  au ( assuming a distance of 390  pc : anthony - twarog @xcite ) .",
    "jcmt observations by dent ( @xcite ) shows that the chemical composition of the dense ambient gas is strongly altered by the presence of the hh  2  radiation , with a strong emission enhancement of the hco@xmath2 .",
    "wolfire & knigl ( @xcite ) carried out a shock model where the x - ray , euv and fuv radiation field from hh  2  penetrates the cloud , initiates an ion chemistry , enhancing the abundances of the hco@xmath2  and the electrons , which produces an excitation enhancement of the hco@xmath2 .",
    "the combination of these two effects lead to a strong emission enhancement .    in this paper",
    "we present 0.81.4  mm cso observations towards the quiescent clump ahead of hh  2 .",
    "we also present 3  mm spectra obtained with the bima array .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the chemical effect produced by the strong hh  2  radiation over the dense quiescent ambient gas around hh  2 .",
    "a second paper will analyze and discuss the spatial distribution of the molecules observed with the bima array ( girart et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "@xmath13    @xmath8 @xmath9 is the fwhm line width    observations were carried out in october 1999 with the 10.4  m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "the 200 - 300 ghz and 300 - 400  ghz receivers were used in conjunction with 50 mhz and 500 mhz acousto - optical spectrometers , which provided velocity coverage of 60 and 600  km  s@xmath14  at 250  ghz and of 40 and 400  km  s@xmath14  at 350  ghz . pointing ,",
    "focus and calibration were checked every few hours using saturn .",
    "the main - beam efficiency , measured by observing saturn , were @xmath1567% at 250  ghz and @xmath1560% at 350  ghz and system temperatures ranged 240670  k. all the spectra were observed at the position : @xmath16 ; @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "this position is very close ( @xmath19 ) to the hh  2  knot l ( e.g. ,  hester et al.@xcite ) and to the peak emission of the hco@xmath2   integrated map from dent ( @xcite ) .",

    "the 10antenna bima array observations were carried out between 1999 october and 2001 may in the c configuration .",
    "a detailed description of the observations and reduction is given in paper ii . in order to compare with the cso spectra , we smoothed the bima maps by convolving them with a gaussian , with a resulting fwhm beam of @xmath21 , the angular resolution of the cso observations at 230  ghz .",
    "a spectrum of each transition observed with bima was synthesized at the position observed with the cso telescope ( see paragraph above ) .",

    "a total of 33 transitions ( including hyperfine transitions ) were detected for 14 species : @xmath22co  and c@xmath23o , hco@xmath2 , h@xmath22co@xmath2 , hc@xmath23o@xmath2 , hcn , h@xmath4co , cn , ch@xmath3oh , cs , so , so@xmath4 and the deuterated species dco@xmath2 and dcn .",
    "the spectral lines peak at a @xmath24within the range of @xmath25  km  s@xmath14  ( cs and hcn ) to @xmath26  km  s@xmath14  ( hco@xmath2 ) .",
    "this range of values is in agreement with previous observations of the quiescent gas ahead of hh  2  ( torrelles et al .",
    "@xcite ; choi & zhou @xcite ) .",
    "the line widths range from @xmath27  km  s@xmath14  for the dco@xmath2 to @xmath28  km  s@xmath14  for hco@xmath2  and hcn .",
    "the 1  mm cs and hcn transitions have large line widths , @xmath152.4  km  s@xmath14 . however , this value is not significant due to the low snr of these lines .",
    "the differences in line center velocity and line width are significant and are due to the combination of velocity gradients within the quiescent ambient gas and a spatial chemical differentiation , which will be discussed in paper ii . yet",
    ", for the hco@xmath2  the larger line width can also be due to a high optical depth and the presence of high velocity emission .",
    "the hco@xmath2  spectrum shows clearly redshifted and blueshifted wings , which implies the presence of high velocity molecular gas . this high velocity component is tracing the interaction between the hh object and the clump , which confirms the spatial association of the clump with hh  2  ( paper ii ) .",
    "figure  [ fmap ] shows the distribution of the quiescent molecular gas , traced by the @xmath22co  emission , ahead of the hh  2  region .",
    "there is clear column density enhancement , mainly downstream of hh2 , whereas at the position of hh  2  or just behind it there is little ambient gas .",
    "the so emission is also shown to better locate the chemically enhanced region just ahead of hh  2 , almost coincident with hh  2  knot l ( e.g. ,  hester et al .",
    "the high excitation hh  2emission , as well as the x - ray and the radio continuum emission , arise from the brightest and largest knot in the [ sii ] image ( see fig  [ fmap ] ) .",
    "hco@xmath2 , so and ch@xmath3oh  are the molecules with more than three transitions detected ( including the rarer isotopes for the hco@xmath2 ) . therefore , the observed emission from these molecules can be used to derive the physical condition of the quiescent gas .",
    "so and ch@xmath3oh  are molecules with moderate dipole moments , 1.55 and 0.90  debyes , respectively , which implies that if the densities are not too low their emission will be close to thermalization .",
    "thus , we carried out the population diagram analysis ( e.g. ,  goldsmith & langer @xcite ) to derive the temperature of the gas and the column densities of so and ch@xmath3oh .",
    "for the hco@xmath2 , since we have two rare isotopes observed , h@xmath22co@xmath2  and hc@xmath23o@xmath2 , we carried out the monte carlo radiative transfer model developed by hogerheijde & van der tak ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method used to carry out the population diagram analysis , which takes into account approximately the optical depth , is described in appendix   [ apendix ] . in order to obtain more accurate fits for the so and",
    "ch@xmath3oh , which were observed with two different telescopes , a 20% calibration uncertainty was included in the estimated errors .",
    "figure  [ frot ] shows the population diagram for the so and ch@xmath3oh   molecules .",
    "the so emission is best fitted for @xmath29  k , @xmath30(so)@xmath31  @xmath32  and a filling factor of @xmath33 .",
    "this solution gives moderate optical depths for the observed transitions , with a maximum value of 1.0 for the  transition .",
    "the high angular resolution ( @xmath34 ) bima so  maps show that the integrated emission arises from a region with a deconvolved size of @xmath35 ( paper ii ) , which implies a filling factor of approximately @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the best solution for the so obtained using the method described in appendix   [ apendix ] , gives a filling factor in agreement with the observed value from the bima maps .",
    "the population diagram technique for the ch@xmath3oh  emission gives the best fit for @xmath37  k , @xmath30(ch@xmath3oh)@xmath38  @xmath32 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the optical depths of the observed transitions are small : the maximum value is 0.56 , for the  a@xmath40  transition",
    ". the smaller filling factor of the ch@xmath3oh  solution with respect to the so is because of its slightly smaller emitting area : @xmath41 ( paper ii ) .",
    "we note that although the optical depths of the so and ch@xmath3oh  are small ( @xmath42 ) the population diagram technique used here and described in   [ apendix ] gives column densities of 20% ( ch@xmath3oh ) to 30% ( so ) higher than the standard population diagram technique where optically thin emission is assumed .",
    "we used the one dimensional version of the monte carlo code developed by hogerheijde & van der tak ( @xcite ) , which calculates the radiative transfer and excitation of molecular lines .",
    "the code is formulated from the viewpoint of cells rather than photons , which allows the separation of local and external contributions of the radiation field .",
    "this gives an accurate and fast performance even for high opacities ( for more details see hogerheijde & van der tak @xcite ) .",
    "the hco@xmath2  emission was assumed to arise from a sphere of radius @xmath43  cm or 6680  au ( 17@xmath11 at the distance of hh  2 ) , which is approximately the radius of the bima hco@xmath2  emission for the peak intensity component ( the hco@xmath2  emission extends over a larger region to the ne of the peak intensity , but this extended component is not picked up by the cso beam ) .",
    "the volume density and temperature were assumed constant and no velocity gradient was adopted ( we note that the results are insensitive for radial velocity gradients of @xmath44  km  s@xmath14  within the adopted radius , i.e.,@xmath159  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath45c@xmath46o to @xmath22c@xmath46o and @xmath45c@xmath46o to @xmath45c@xmath23o abundance ratios adopted were 63 and 560 , derived for the orion region by langer & penzias ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we explored a large range of values for the volume density , the temperature , the molecular fractional abundance and the intrinsic line width .",
    "the resulting synthetic maps of the different transitions were convolved with a gaussian to match the angular resolution of the spectra ( @xmath47 for the  and  transitions and @xmath48 for the  transition ) .",
    "the best fit is obtained for a volume density of @xmath49  @xmath1 , a temperature of @xmath50  k , an intrinsic line width of @xmath51  km  s@xmath14 , and a hco@xmath2  fractional abundance of @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fhcop ] shows the overlap of the observed and synthetic spectra for the hco@xmath2 , h@xmath22co@xmath2  and hc@xmath23o@xmath2transitions .",
    "the synthetic spectra fit well the observed spectra , except for the hco@xmath2  .",
    "the lack of observed emission at the central and redshifted sections of the line , as compared with the predicted spectra , is possibly due to a combination of two effects .",
    "first , it could be due to the missing flux , a consequence of the lack of short spacing visibilities at the interferometer .",
    "second , it is possible that the hco@xmath2   is affected by the absorption of a cold and low density component of the cloud , whose effects will only be observable in the lowest rotational transition of abundant species with high dipole moment ( see girart et al .",
    ".    the assumed radius , derived from the hco@xmath2  maps , could be highly uncertain due to high optical depth , absorption by the foreground cold gas or resolving out the large - scale hco@xmath2  emission .",
    "however , the models run with radii higher or lower than roughly a 30% of the value assumed do not fit the observed spectra . for small changes in the radii",
    "the best solutions are always in the 12 - 14k temperature range .",
    "the temperature derived here is only slightly higher than the temperature derived from the so and ch@xmath3oh  population diagrams .",
    "this implies that the observed so and ch@xmath3oh  transitions are close to thermalization for the derived volume density , @xmath53  @xmath1 .      from the previous analyses the derived temperature of the cloud is @xmath50  k. yet",
    ", the rotational transitions of the observed molecules may have excitation temperatures significantly lower than this value because of subthermalization , i.e. ,  the critical density of the transition is higher than the volume density of the cloud , @xmath53  @xmath1 . in particular",
    "this is the case for the high dipole moment molecules like hco@xmath2  ( 3.90 debyes ) , hcn ( 2.98 debyes ) , h@xmath4co ( 2.33 debyes ) or cs ( 1.98 debyes ) .",
    "thus , for example , the critical density of the h@xmath4co  and cs  are 6@xmath54 and 7@xmath54  @xmath1 , respectively ( choi & zhou @xcite ) .",
    "if at least two transitions are detected and the emission is optically thin , the excitation temperature can be obtained from the following two expressions : @xmath55 and @xmath56 where the subindices @xmath57 and @xmath58 refer to the rotational transitions , @xmath59 is the filling factor , @xmath60 is the planck function in temperature units , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the k - level and nuclear spin degeneracies , respectively , @xmath63 is the energy of the upper level of the transition , and @xmath64 the optical depth . in most of the cases here ,",
    "the spectra of the transitions used to derive @xmath65 were obtained at the same angular resolution , so @xmath66 .",
    "hco@xmath2 , and co are the only molecules with rarer isotopes observed .",
    "therefore , for the other molecules , their emission is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "the beam - averaged column densities of the observed species were derived assuming that the excitation temperature , @xmath65 , is the same for all the rotational transitions of the same species , with the exception of the so and ch@xmath3oh , whose column densities were derived from the population diagram (   [ pop ] ) .",
    "the hco@xmath2  column density can be derived from the model carried out using the monte carlo radiative transfer code (   [ mcarlo ] ) or directly from the line intensity ratios as described earlier ( eq .  [ eb ] and [ ea ] ) . from the model derived in ",
    "[ mcarlo ] , the hco@xmath2  beam - averaged column density for the best fitted model is 1.0@xmath67  @xmath32 . on the other hand , for the intensity ratio method , the filling factor ratio of the  and transitions , @xmath68 , should be derived in order to properly use eq .",
    "[ eb ] and [ ea ] . from the fwhm of the hco@xmath2  emission , 34@xmath11 ( see   [ mcarlo ] ) we can obtain a rough estimation of this ratio : @xmath69 .",
    "thus from the line ratio analysis we estimate that the h@xmath22co@xmath2  transition is optically thin ( @xmath70 ) and that the excitation temperature is within the 6.2 - 7.0  k range .",
    "therefore , from the h@xmath22co@xmath2  integrated line intensity , the hco@xmath2  beam - averaged column density is within the 3 - 5@xmath71  @xmath32  range .",
    "the line intensity ratio analysis derives an excitation temperature lower than the kinetic temperature obtained in   [ mcarlo ] and also a lower column density ( by a factor 2 - 3 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the @xmath68 derived from the hco@xmath2  maps ( see   [ mcarlo ] ) could account for this discrepancy .",
    "alternatively , non - lte effects , due to subthermalization , could also cause this discrepancy .",
    "since the dco@xmath2 has a similar dipole moment as the hco@xmath2 , we adopted the same excitation temperature derived from the line ratios of the hco@xmath2 : within the 6 - 7  k range , the column density of the dco@xmath2 column density is @xmath72  @xmath32 .",
    "this value is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the hco@xmath2 .      for the hcn we fitted the three hyperfine components of the transitions using class .",
    "the best solutions of the fit give moderate or low optical depths , @xmath73 , although the excitation temperature is not well constrained , @xmath74  k. however , the observed relative intensities of the f=11 , 21 and 01 transitions , 1.7@xmath750.2:3.9@xmath750.4:1.0 , do not agree with the 3:5:1 value expected under lte conditions , but it is within the range of values measured in other molecular clouds ( guilloteau & baudry @xcite ; wannier et al .",
    "@xcite ; walmsley et al.@xcite ) .",
    "velocity gradients and a non - uniform density could cause this `` anomaly '' ( guilloteau & baudry @xcite ; cao et al.@xcite ; gonzalez  alfonso & cernicharo @xcite ) .",
    "the  to  integrated intensity ratio yields an excitation temperature of @xmath76  k , significantly lower than that derived from the population diagram of the so and ch@xmath3oh .",
    "this implies that the line emission is subthermalized , which could also cause the `` anomaly '' in the hyperfine line ratios .",
    "the hcn beam - averaged column density was derived using @xmath77  k.    for the dcn , we adopted the same excitation temperature as the one for the hcn , 6  k.      the two transitions detected yield an excitation temperature of @xmath76  k , implying that the emission is subthermalized ( the upper limits of the undetected transitions are not tight enough to better constrain this value ) .",
    "as in the case of hcn and hco@xmath2 this is due to its high dipole moment . in order to calculate the h@xmath4co  beam - averaged column density we used this excitation temperature and adopted an ortho to para ratio of 1.5 , which should be reasonable for the h@xmath4co  formation and/or ortho - para conversion on grain surfaces ( dickens & irvine @xcite ) .",

    "if an excitation temperature of about 10  k is assumed , then the line ratio gives an  optical depth of 10 . from the radiative transfer equation for the optically thick case , @xmath81-j[{t_{\\rm bg}}])$ ] ,",
    "the filling factor can be derived and , therefore , a rough estimation of the source size , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( 30@xmath11 is the angular resolution of the spectra ) .",
    "the peak intensity of the  line , @xmath84  k , would imply a source size of only 5@xmath11 if the line is optically thick .",
    "however , the bima maps of this transition show that the emission arises from a significantly larger area , @xmath85 ( paper ii ) .",
    "thus , we suggest that the  line emission is `` anomalous '' , although we can not discern if this is an instrumental effect or if it is a real anomaly . in order to estimate the so@xmath4 column density we used the  transition , assuming an excitation temperature of 10  k.      the co and its isotopes have a low dipole moment , 0.11 debyes , so their emission is likely thermalized .",
    "therefore , the excitation temperature used to derived the co column density is 13  k. figure  [ fmu ] shows the values of the excitation temperature _ versus _ the dipole moment of the analyzed aforementioned molecules . with the exception of the hco@xmath2 , there is a trend of decreasing @xmath65 with increasing dipole moment , @xmath86 , which is expected since higher @xmath86 implies more severe subthermalization .",
    "[ fmu ] can be used to roughly extrapolate the excitation temperature for the other observed molecules .",
    "thus , we adopted a @xmath87  k for those molecules with @xmath88  debyes ( cn , ocs , h@xmath4s , hcs@xmath2 , h@xmath4cs , hnco , hcooh and ch@xmath3sh ) and @xmath77  k for the rest of the molecules ( @xmath89-c@xmath3h@xmath4 , hc@xmath3n , ch@xmath3cn and nh@xmath4cn ) , which indeed have a dipole moment higher than 3 debyes .",
    "table  [ tcdens ] shows the beam - averaged column densities derived from the observations .",
    "the fractional abundances of the observed molecules with respect to the co molecule are also listed in this table ( note that the estimated fractional abundance relative to the co is a beam - averaged value ) .",
    "in order to be able to establish the effects of the shock - induced radiation from hh  2  on the chemical composition of the quiescent clump ahead of the hh object , it is necessary to compare the relative abundances of the molecules detected with respect to other environments associated with dense molecular material .",
    "before the radiation reached the clump , this molecular cloud had likely the properties of the starless dark molecular cores .",
    "it is well known that there are important chemical differences between starless dark clouds and star forming regions , and that there are important gradients within the same molecular cloud , a consequence of the evolutionary effects or due to the presence of nearby star formation sites ( e.g. ,  van dishoeck & blake @xcite ) .",
    "since we want to compare the general chemical properties of the molecular clouds with those from the molecular emission ahead of hh  2 , we have estimated the logarithmic median and standard deviation of the relative abundance ( with respect to co ) of the molecules detected in hh  2  and compare this with a sample of three different types of molecular environments : high mass and low mass star forming molecular clouds , and starless dark molecular clouds .",
    "figure  [ fxmol ] shows shows this comparison .",
    "interestingly , from figure  [ fxmol ] , the observed molecules ahead of hh  2can be classified into four groups , depending on their abundance with respect to other molecular clouds .",
    "( 1 ) strongly enhanced molecules : hco@xmath2 , ch@xmath3oh  and h@xmath4co .",
    "their relative abundances are enhanced mostly within a factor of 5 to 10 with respect to the typical values found in the molecular clouds .",
    "in particular , the enhancement of hco@xmath2  and h@xmath4co  in hh  2  with respect to the high mass star forming regions is more than an order of magnitude , but only by a factor of 2 - 3 with respect to the dark molecular clouds .",
    "( 2 ) weakly enhanced molecules , so and so@xmath4 .",
    "their enhancement with respect to the molecular clouds is a factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "the only exception is that the so@xmath4 has similar relative abundances as the massive star forming regions .",
    "( 3 ) the cn shows no apparent enhancement with respect to the dark molecular clouds , whereas it is depleted with respect to the high mass star forming regions . the strong enhancement ( an order of magnitude ) with respect to the low mass star forming regions may not be significant since there is only one data point .",
    "( 4 ) depleted molecules : cs and hcn . in hh",
    "2  these molecules are clearly depleted with respect to the other molecular clouds , with depletion factors in the 3 to 7 range .",
    "here we briefly compare our observational results with the abundances derived in the vw99 models . a more detailed model of the hh2 clump ( in light of the present observations ) will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "columns 3 to 6 of table  [ tmodel ] lists the best matched theoretical column densities and the visual extinction at which this column density was obtained for two models out of the grid from vw99 for clump densities of 1@xmath90  @xmath1  ( model 4 ) and of 1@xmath0  @xmath1  ( model 5 ) , 3 years after irradiation of the clump has started .",
    "table  [ tmodel ] clearly confirms the qualitative results from vw99 where many species were predicted to be abundant in clumps ahead of hh objects .",
    "the vw99 models were not specific to any particular hh object but use an extensive gas and grain phase chemistry to follow the formation of a clump ahead of a shock with a fixed enhanced radiation field ( equivalent to 20 times the ambient interstellar radiation field ) acting upon it .",
    "the clump is treated as a one - dimensional slab extending up to 6 visual magnitudes to the center .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     in general , the vw99 models suggest that : ( i ) hh2 is a young object , probably on the order of 1000 years ; ( ii ) the best estimate for the volume density of the clump is @xmath91 10@xmath92 @xmath1 , somewhat less than the density derived from observations ; ( iii ) the visual extinction at the center of the so peak emission with respect to hh  2  is about 5 - 7 mags ; vw99 models only extend to 6 mag ; although quantitatively the models do not match the observed abundances for every species at the maximum @xmath93 , most of them are well represented at some visual extinction .",
    "in fact , model 4 of vw99 reproduces the observed abundance ( within half order of magnitude ) for every species for an optimal visual extinction , different from species to species : this may be an indication of the displacement found with the bima array ( paper ii ) .",
    "more specifically , it is interesting to note that hco@xmath2 , the best tracer of hh clumps , is underabundant for visual extinction larger than @xmath15 1 mag .",
    "this is because at high visual extinction the clump is more shielded from the radiation and this would limit the amount of ionized carbon , yielding a low production of hco@xmath2 ; a higher radiation field may well therefore increase its abundance .",
    "the presence of x - ray emission in hh  2  ( pravdo et al .",
    "@xcite ) may have some effects on the chemistry .",
    "a detailed model for hh  2  which takes such considerations into account is in preparation .",
    "we presented a 30.8  mm molecular line survey toward the quiescent molecular clump ahead of the bright hh  2  object .",
    "a total of 14 species were detected ( including different isotopes and deuterated species ) and the upper limits of 12 more species were obtained .",
    "multi - transitions observations of hco@xmath2 , so and ch@xmath3oh  show that the gas is not only quiescent , but also cold , @xmath50  k , in spite of being close to hh  2 .",
    "the density of the cloud is roughly 3@xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "comparisons of the relative abundances ( with respect to co ) were made with different dense molecular gas environments , including quiescent , starless dark clouds , and active low and high mass star forming cores .",
    "we confirm the peculiar chemical composition of the gas ahead of the hh objects , a consequence of the mantle removal and further photochemistry produced by the strong radiation generated in the shocks . in particular , we found that :    * hco@xmath2 , ch@xmath3oh  and h@xmath4co  are strongly enhanced with respect to other molecular cores . *",
    "so and so@xmath4 are weakly enhanced with respect to other molecular environments .",
    "the only exception is that the so@xmath4 has similar relative abundances as the massive star forming regions .",
    "* cn does not show a significant enhancement or depletion with respect to the starless dark clouds .",
    "however it is underabundant with respect to high mass star forming regions . *",
    "hcn and cs show clear depletion when the hh  2  relative abundances are compared with most of the molecular clouds .",
    "finally , the chemical composition of hh  2  confirms the qualitative results of the vw99 complex chemical model that follows the chemical behavior of a molecular clump irradiated by a hh object .",
    "we thank s. curiel for providing the [ sii ] images of hh  2 .",

    "the population diagram ( also called rotation diagram in the literature ) analysis has been extensively used in the literature to obtain the temperature and the column densities for molecules with several transitions observed ( e.g. ,   linke , frerking & thaddeus @xcite ; turner  @xcite ) . in the use of the population diagram",
    ", we assume lte conditions ( i.e. ,  all the transitions are populated with a single excitation temperature @xmath65 ) , optically thin emission and @xmath94 . under these assumptions",
    "the population diagram can be described with the following expression : @xmath95 with @xmath96 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the @xmath97-level and nuclear spin degeneracies respectively , @xmath86 the electric dipole moment of the molecule , s , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the line strength , frequency , main - beam brightness temperature and the energy of the upper state ( in temperature units ) of the transition , @xmath101 the total beam - averaged column density of the molecule , @xmath102 the rotational partition function of the molecule .",
    "this formula appears in the population diagram ( in which the left hand part of the formula is plotted _ versus _",
    "@xmath100 ) as a straight line . however , several factors can yield temperature and column densities that are significantly different from their true values : subthermalization ( or non - lte excitation ) , significant optical depths , excitation gradients within the beam and beam dilution ( when different angular resolutions are used ) .",
    "goldsmith & langer ( @xcite ) describe the effects that subthermalization and non - null optical depths have on the population diagram .",
    "in order to better use the population diagram technique we just assume that all the rotational levels are populated with the same excitation temperature ( which in most cases is likely lower than the kinetic temperature : see goldsmith & langer @xcite ) . in this case",

    "note that when @xmath109 and @xmath94 , equation  [ drotb ] becomes equation  [ drot ] .",
