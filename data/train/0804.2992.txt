    "usually the input - output response of a linear time - invariant circuit is described in the frequency domain by its transfer function , i.e.  a single rational function .",
    "this translates directly into a linear differential equation with constant coefficients in the time domain .",
    "the advantage of this approach is , that in any guise , only one ( differential ) equation is needed to completely describe the quantity a designer is interested in .",
    "this method fails miserably , when a transformation from the time to the frequency domain is not possible , e.g. , when nonlinear circuits have to be examined , which lead to systems of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "even though most of the times , these can be given in symbolic terms , any single quantity in the circuit usually is described by a `` waveform '' , which results from assigning a numerical value to each symbol , followed by a numerical calculation using computer simulation .",
    "the advantage of having only _ one _ describing equation seems to have been irrevocably lost , when nonlinear circuits are considered .",
    "thus , up until now , nonlinear circuits seemed nearly inaccessible to most symbolic approaches .",
    "this problem is not a new one , and it is not limited to the area of analog circuits alone .",
    "several years ago , researchers in nonlinear control theory have proposed to use constructive methods from differential algebra to tackle their problems . at the same time  and inspired in part by this proposal ",
    "mathematicians started to implement algorithms from differential algebra , which had already been formulated in the 1950s .",
    "these programmes became part of the maple computer algebra system .",
    "at the smacd - meeting in 1998 g.  carr ferro gave examples of how to transform systems of nonlinear differential equations containing certain transcendental functions , that arise from analog circuits , into systems of nonlinear ",
    "differential equations @xcite , and thus brought the area of constructive differential algebra in contact with the area of symbolic circuit analysis and design . in this paper",
    "we will take this approach several steps further and show , how single equations for any quantity in a circuit can be derived from these systems",
    ". we will be able to give a new and easy algorithm for linear circuits , which works in the time domain , and uses only differentiation and gaussian elimination .",
    "for nonlinear circuits we will resort to the algorithms already implemented in maple",
    ". we will comment on how to apply them and produce several examples .",
    "to get a first flavour of things , we start our discussion with linear circuits and their corresponding systems of linear differential equations .",
    "but , instead of working in the frequency domain , using the laplace - transform to deduce the transfer function for a sought - after quantity and thus its characterizing differential equation , we will remain in the time domain .      in this section",
    "we will present a new algorithm , that , starting from a set of state equations , only uses repeated differentiation and , finally , gaussian elimination , to compute the single differential equation for any given quantity .",
    "we will restrict our presentation to just three state variables @xmath0 but it is easy to extend the method , shown below , to any number of state variables .",
    "so , let us suppose , that a given linear circuit can be described by a set of linear state equations .",
    "we ask for one single differential equation describing , without loss of generality , the state variable @xmath1 again it is easy to handle other state variables or any output variable @xmath2 which is a linear combination of state variables and inputs , in an analogous manner .",
    "let the system be given by @xmath3    where @xmath4 denote the state variables and @xmath5 represent linear combinations of the inputs ( and eventually their derivatives ) .",
    "clearly , if @xmath4 satisfy ( [ stateeq ] ) , their derivatives will satisfy @xmath6    if @xmath7 state variables are given , we have to repeat the above procedure @xmath8 times .",
    "it is a well known observation ( which will be shown as a byproduct of our algorithm ) , that @xmath9 linear first order state equations lead to one @xmath9th order differential equation for any single quantity .",
    "thus , in our example , we need one further equation for the third derivative @xmath10 of @xmath11 , which we get by differentiating once again the first equation of ( [ stateeqder1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath12    next , we write down all of the above equations into one system , where the vector of variables is given by all the derivatives of all state variables , that have been produced by the above procedure .     -0.5 cm    @xmath13    we point out the fact , that the variables should be arranged according to the _ ordering _",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 for our algorithm to work , it is essential , that the last entries of the vector are the derivatives of the variable , for which we want to deduce the differential equation , in decreasing order .",
    "the final step is to use gaussian elimination to convert the system into one in upper triangular form @xmath24{gaussian } } \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a linear combination of the functions",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32    since we had @xmath33 ( obviously ) linearly independent equations for @xmath34 variables , the last row will give one equation for the last @xmath35 variables , which according to our special ordering are all derivatives of @xmath11 .",
    "thus we have deduced the differential equation for @xmath11 , which we were looking for .",
    "this is the same equation , which we would have found , if we had worked in the frequency domain and had calculated the transfer function for the laplace transform @xmath36 of @xmath1      it might happen , that a linear time - invariant circuit does not possess a description by state equations",
    ". nevertheless it may be describable by so - called semistate equations , i.e.  equations of the form @xmath37 in which @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant matrices , @xmath42 being singular , @xmath43 denotes the semistate vector , @xmath44 the vector of inputs and @xmath45 the vector of outputs .",
    "the algorithm given above can be adapted to this situation , but we have to keep in mind , that even if @xmath9 semistate equations are given , the differential equation for any quantity might be of degree strictly less than @xmath9 .",
    "we will see this effect in the example given below , which recently appeared in @xcite .    *",
    "( ota - circuit ) * [ ota ]        the ota circuit shown above can be described by the semistate system @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the node to ground voltages of the respective nodes and @xmath49 denotes the current into node @xmath50 as shown in @xcite , the transfer function @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 we will deduce the corresponding differential equation for @xmath49 in the time domain , using the above system of semistate equations and a slight modification of the algorithm for state equations.this algorithm is closer to the one , that will be used for nonlinear circuits .",
    "it is based on two main principles :    1 .",
    "the variables @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 and their derivatives , are supposed to be ordered by @xmath56 when a term is to be eliminated , we always choose the term of highest order .",
    "equations are only differentiated when  necessary  .",
    "so , let us get into details ; the system was given by @xmath57 the term of highest order appearing in ( [ otaa ] ) - ( [ otac ] ) is @xmath58 equation ( [ otac ] ) gives @xmath59 this can be used to eliminate @xmath60 from ( [ otaa ] ) and ( [ otab ] ) . furthermore , after differentiating ( [ x1elim ] ) , we get @xmath61 thus we are able to remove all instances of @xmath60 in the first two equations .",
    "consequently we are led to : @xmath62 clearly , these two equations imply the equality @xmath63 which gives @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 putting this into ( [ otae ] ) , we arrive at @xmath66 which finally results in @xmath67 this is the time domain equivalent of the transfer function ( [ transferota ] ) , which we wanted to deduce .",
    "this is not the time and the space to give even a cursory treatment of those parts of differential algebra , which are needed to understand the sometimes subtle generalization to the nonlinear case of the algorithms shown above . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to know , that , cum grano salis , all the mechanisms are already visible in the example of the ota circuit .",
    "fortunately there already exist several implementations of the necessary algorithms within the computer algebra system maple",
    ". we will show by way of the above example the workings of one of these , the diffalg - package , created by f.  boulier @xcite , @xcite and improved by e.  hubert @xcite et al .  a more detailed description ( suitable for beginners with a mathematical background )",
    "can be found in the world wide web @xcite , @xcite .    after starting a maple - session ,",

    "this has to be done in form of so - called _",
    "differential polynomials_. these are polynomials in the unknown functions @xmath70 their ( time ) derivatives @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 , the excitations @xmath74 and their derivatives , again .    in our example , we get three differential polynomials , which read in maple - notation :    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    next we have to tell the programme , which symbols it has to treat as constants .",
    "this is done with the command field_extension .",
    "diffalg assumes , that we work over the rational numbers as ground field , where any further constants are considered as lying in a transcendental field extension of @xmath78 ( i.e.  we are allowed to divide by constants different from @xmath79 , and constants do not satisfy any algebraic relations ) .",
    "if we work with symbols , e.g.  for capacitors , resistors etc .",
    ", this poses no problem . if we work with real coefficients ( e.g.  floating point numbers or algebraic numbers like @xmath80 ) major problems may arise . in our case",
    "we define    @xmath81 ) ; $ ]    @xmath82    finally we define a so - called _ differential ring _ , which is supposed to contain all the objects of interest ( i.e.  differential polynomials and constants ) , and in which we are allowed to do the following operations    1 .",
    "multiply a differential polynomials with a constant ; 2 .",
    "add and multiply differential polynomials ; 3 .",
    "differentiate differential polynomials ( if a constant is differentiated , the result is @xmath79 ) .    as we have seen above",
    ", it is very important , that we define an ordering on differential monomials .",
    "this is needed to control the elimination process . for this purpose",
    ", diffalg asks for a ranking of the time dependent variables , from which it produces the obvious  elimination ordering  .",
    "the variable , for which we want to know the differential equation , should be the last before the excitations .",

    "now , that we know , how the maple package diffalg can be used to deduce the time equivalent of the transfer function from any system of linear differential equations ( with constant coefficients ) , in this section we will apply diffalg in an analogous manner to several systems of nonlinear equations , which come from nonlinear circuits .",
    "( * damped resonant circuit with a nonlinear inductivity ) *    as our first nonlinear example we have chosen a well known circuit from the literature , which leads to the duffing equation ( cp .",
    "@xcite , example 11 - 1 , or @xcite , chapter 1.3.2 . ) .",
    "the resistor and the capacitor are assumed to be linear , i.e. , they are described by @xmath92 the inductor is assumed to be nonlinear , being described by @xmath93 where the current @xmath94 is approximated by the cubic @xmath95 finally , kirchhoff s equation lead to @xmath96 equations ( [ duffnw])-([duffkirchhoff ] ) are translated into their corresponding differential polynomials and are used as input for the diffalg - routine .",
    "this produces as part of the output of the subroutine rewrite_rules : @xmath97 which is formula 1.30 in @xcite and is an equivalent of the duffing equation : @xmath98    * ( chua s circuit ) * our next example is chua s circuit , the first example of a physically realizable circuit , showing chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "this circuit consists of two linear capacitors , one linear inductor , one linear resistor and one nonlinear resistor , as shown below .",
    "since it is easy to write down the equations for the linear elements and the kirchhoff equations , we concentrate on the mathematical description of the nonlinear resistor .",
    "the classic description of @xmath99 using piecewise linear functions , is unsuitable for our purposes , because it does not satisfy the right differentiability conditions .",
    "thus we use the one , presented e.g.  in @xcite , where the negative arctangent is used to produce the nonlinear @xmath100-@xmath101 characteristic of @xmath102 this leads to @xmath103 we are now confronted with a new problem : the arctangent is a transcendental function , thus ( [ arctan ] ) would not give a differential polynomial , as needed .",
    "one procedural solution to this problem was presented before in @xcite . in the present paper , we are satisfied with the fact , that ( [ arctan ] ) implies yet another algebraic differential equation @xmath104 which obviously is given by a differential polynomial and which we can use as input for diffalg instead of ( [ arctan ] ) . from this equation together with the kirchhoff equations and the characterizing equations of the linear elements , diffalg produces the differential equation @xmath105\\\\   + & \\ ,   2\\ , i_0 \\cdot   \\frac{v_0}{\\left(x^2+v_0 ^ 2\\right)^2 } \\cdot l\\,x\\,\\dot x \\cdot \\left [ 3\\ , c_2 r\\ , \\ddot x + \\dot x \\right]\\\\ - & \\left .",

    "185ff .",

    "* ( diode circuit with lc - load and nonideal voltage source ) *        the above circuit may not be of much practical interest .",
    "nevertheless it is a good test of the power of our approach ( and the capabilities of diffalg ) , since it slightly generalizes example [ simplerectifier ] and we increase the number of dynamic elements in our circuit .",
    "again , the diode is assumed to be nonideal , given by ( [ diodediffpol ] ) .    the output voltage @xmath119 is described by the equation @xmath120 \\right\\}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in the course of our investigations ,",
    "we have tried a number of larger circuits , which in principle are accessible to our approach .",
    "we met two main obstacles , which are natural in the  business  of symbolic methods :    1 .",
    "the combinatorial explosion , resulting in a larger and larger number of terms contained in the final differential equation , and 2 .",
    "the massive increase in time , needed by diffalg to produce this equation .    in the sequel",
    "we give a short report on these experiments :    * ( peak rectifier with power transformer ) *    -1.2 cm        this kind of circuit is described in the introduction to chapter 3.7 in @xcite . as shown above , we have used the model given by horneber in his phd - thesis @xcite , section 14.1 .",
    "there , it is the smaller of two examples , the other being the  ring modulator  , which has become a benchmark in the numerical analysis of initial value problems @xcite .    from our point of view , we can tell , that diffalg , although needing substantial more time than in the previous examples ( 1 - 2 minutes instead of only seconds ) , is able to produce a fifth order differential equation for the output voltage @xmath121 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to reproduce this result here , since the initial output even after some simplifications contains more than 600 summands . thus some more ",
    "post processing  is needed to get an intelligible result .",
    "even with the help of other facilities of maple this work has not been finished , yet .",
    "finally we have tried our approach on a *  simple  single - stage common - emitter amplifier * ( @xcite , chapter 4.11 ) as modelled in @xcite and on the above mentioned * ring modulator * of horneber . in both cases , up until now , even though we have used several days of computing time , we were not able to produce any results .",
    "although the latter  very ambitious  example ( which presumably will lead to an differential equation of order 18 ) may be beyond the scope of any computer algebra system for some time , the first should be within our grasp and should be attacked further .",
    "in this paper we have shown , how , using constructive methods from differential algebra and one of their the package diffalg of the computer algebra system linear and nonlinear circuits can be described by a single differential equation . in the future",
    "it will be necessary to further examine the power of this approach , i.e.  to find more and larger circuits , which can be treated this way .",
    "furthermore , if the number of these circuits is large enough , methods have to be found , that allow a fast and  easy  analysis of the resulting equations , analogous to the analysis of linear circuits by way of their transfer functions .",
