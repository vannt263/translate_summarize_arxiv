    "this paper is devoted to the application of the semidefinite programming method to estimates of the size of the largest possible two - distance set on the sphere @xmath3 .",
    "a spherical two - distance set is a finite collection @xmath4 of unit vectors in @xmath0 such that the set of distances between any two distinct vectors in @xmath4 has cardinality two . estimating the maximum size @xmath5 of such a set is a classical problem in distance geometry that has been studied for several decades .",
    "we begin with an overview of known results .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath5 is obtained as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be the standard basis in @xmath7 .",
    "the points @xmath8 form a spherical two - distance set in the plane @xmath9 ( after scaling ) , and therefore @xmath10    the first major result for upper bounds was obtained by delsarte , goethals , and seidel @xcite .",
    "they proved that , irrespective of the actual values of the distances , the following `` harmonic '' bound holds true : @xmath11 they also showed that this bound is tight for dimensions @xmath12 where it is attained by sets of equiangular lines .",
    "moreover , the results of @xcite , bannai et al .",
    "@xcite , and nebe and venkov @xcite imply that @xmath5 can attain the harmonic bound only if @xmath13 with the exception of an infinite sequence of values of @xmath14 that begins with @xmath15 . therefore , unless @xmath16 is of the above form , @xmath17 these results are proved using the link between 2-distance sets and tight spherical 4-designs established in @xcite .",
    "another advance in estimating the function @xmath5 was made by musin @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 and suppose that @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the values of the squared distances between the points .",
    "musin proved that @xmath21 he then used delsarte s linear programming method to prove that @xmath22 if @xmath23    here we make another step for spherical two - distance sets , extending the range of dimensions in which the bound is tight .",
    "the state of the art for @xmath5 can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 if @xmath27 then @xmath28 as detailed in the remarks after eq . above .",
    "the part of this theorem that is established in the present paper relates to dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath29 our results are computational in nature and are obtained using the semidefinite programming method .",
    "the other parts of this theorem follow from the results in @xcite .",
    "as far as actual constructions of spherical two - distance sets are concerned , rather little is known beyond the set of midpoints of the edges of a regular simplex mentioned above .",
    "another way of constructing such sets is to start with a set of equiangular lines in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if the angle between each pair of lines is @xmath30 then taking one point from each pair of points on @xmath31 defined by the line , we obtain a two - distance set with @xmath32 the largest possible number of equiangular lines in @xmath0 is @xmath33 ( this result is due to gerzon , see @xcite ) .",
    "this bound is attained for @xmath34 for instance , for @xmath35 the set of 6 lines is obtained from 6 diagonals of the icosahedron , which gives many ways of constructing inequivalent spherical two - distance sets of cardinality 6 .",
    "the only three instances in which the known spherical two - distance sets are of cardinality greater than @xmath33 occur in dimensions @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "a semidefinite program is an optimization problem of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an @xmath40 variable matrix , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given hermitian matrices , @xmath43 is a given vector and @xmath44 is the inner product of two matrices .",
    "semidefinite programming is an extension of linear programming that has found a range of applications in combinatorial optimization , control theory , distance geometry , and coding theory .",
    "general introduction to semidefinite programming is given , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the main problem addressed by the sdp method in distance geometry is related to deriving bounds on the cardinality of point sets in a metric space @xmath45 with a given set of properties such as a given minimum separation between distinct points in the set .",
    "the sdp method has its roots in harmonic analysis of the isometry group of the metric space in question .",
    "it is broadly applicable in both finite and compact infinite spaces .",
    "examples of the former include the hamming and johnson spaces , their @xmath46-analogs , other metric spaces on the set of @xmath16-strings over a finite alphabet , as well as the finite projective space .",
    "the main example in the infinite case is given by real and complex spheres , although the sdp method is also applicable in other compact homogeneous spaces .",
    "working out the details in each example is a nontrivial task that includes analysis of irreducible modules in the space of functions @xmath47 under the action of the isometry group @xmath48 of @xmath45 .",
    "the zonal matrices that arise in this analysis initially have large size that can be reduced relying on symmetries arising from the group action .",
    "this gives rise to an sdp optimization problem that is solved by computer for a given set of dimensions ( the numerical part is also not straightforward and rather time - consuming ) .",
    "foundations and analysis of particular cases have been the subject of a considerable number of research and overview publications in the last decade ; see in particular recent surveys @xcite and references therein .",
    "the origins of the sdp method and the discussed applications can be traced back to the work of delsarte @xcite which introduced the machinery of association schemes in the analysis of point configurations ( codes ) in finite spaces .",
    "delsarte derived linear programming ( lp ) bounds on the cardinality of a set of points in the space under the condition on the minimum separation of distinct points in the set .",
    "delsarte s results were linked to harmonic analysis and group representations in the works of delsarte , goethals and seidel @xcite ( for the case @xmath31 ) and kabatyansky and levenshtein @xcite ( for general compact symmetric spaces ) .    from now on we focus on the case @xmath49",
    "let @xmath50 denote the gegenbauer polynomials of degree @xmath51 .",
    "they are defined recursively as follows : @xmath52 and @xmath53 delsarte et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for any finite set of points @xmath54 @xmath55 the proof of this inequality in @xcite used the addition formula for spherical harmonics .",
    "an earlier , geometric proof of had been given by schoenberg @xcite , although his work was not known to researchers in the area discussed until at least the 1990s .",
    "positivity conditions give rise to the lp bound on the cardinality of spherical two - distance sets .",
    "[ thm : dgs ] ( delsarte et al .",
    "@xcite ) let @xmath54 be a finite set and suppose that @xmath56 for any @xmath57 then @xmath58    in this theorem @xmath59 are the optimization variables that refer to the number of ordered pairs of points in @xmath4 with inner product @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath62 this theorem is a specialization of a more general lp bound on spherical codes of @xcite .",
    "applications of semidefinite programming in coding theory and distance geometry gained momentum after the pioneering work of schrijver @xcite that derived sdp bounds on codes in the hamming and johnson spaces .",
    "schijver s approach was based on the so - called terwilliger algebra of the association scheme and formed a far - reaching generalization of the work of delsarte @xcite .",
    "elements of the groundwork for sdp bounds in the hamming space were laid by dunkl @xcite , although this connection was also made somewhat later @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed general survey of the approach via association schemes and further references .",
    "sdp bounds for the real sphere were derived by bachoc and vallentin @xcite in the context of the kissing number problem .",
    "the kissing number @xmath63 is the maximum number of unit spheres that can touch a unit sphere without overlapping , i.e. the maximum number of points on the sphere such that the angular separation between any pair of them is at least @xmath64 following @xcite , define a @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 by setting @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a positive integer , and a matrix @xmath69 by setting @xmath70 where the sum is over all permutations on 3 elements .",
    "note that @xmath71 for all @xmath72 and all @xmath73 one of the main results of @xcite is that for any finite set of points @xmath54 @xmath74 the matrices @xmath75 play the role of the constraints @xmath76 in the general sdp problem .",
    "positivity constraints give rise to a general sdp bound on the cardinality of point sets obtained in @xcite , where it was used to improve upper bounds on @xmath63 in small dimensions . in the next section we state a specialization of this bound for the case of 2-distance sets .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that constraints arise from the unrestricted action of @xmath48 on @xmath77 constraints are obtained by considering only actions that fix an arbitrary given point on the sphere .",
    "further sdp bounds can be obtained by considering zonal matrices that arise from actions that fix any given number of points ; however even for two points , actual evaluation of the bounds requires significant computational effort @xcite .",
    "the general sdp bound on spherical codes of @xcite specializes to our case as follows .",
    "[ thm : sdp ] let @xmath4 be a spherical two - distance set with inner products @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a positive integer .",
    "the cardinality @xmath78 is bounded above by the solution of the following semidefinite programming problem : @xmath79            in this theorem the variables @xmath86 refer to the number of ordered pairs of vectors in @xmath4 with inner product @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ; namely we have @xmath87 we note that the sdp problem seeks to optimize the same linear form as the lp problem , but adds more constraints on the configuration . because of this , theorem [ thm : sdp ] usually gives tighter bounds than theorem [ thm : dgs ] .",
    "this fact is evident from the table below and is also known from the calculation of kissing numbers in @xcite .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , implementation of sdp for two - distance sets differs from earlier computations in @xcite in that in our case there are no limits on the minimum separation of the points .",
    "next , we restrict our calculations to the case @xmath88 as no improvement is observed for larger values .",
    "finally , by a result larman et al .",
    "@xcite , if @xmath89 then the inner products @xmath90 are related by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an integer .",
    "thus we obtain a family of sdp bounds parametrized by @xmath93 since @xmath94 we get that @xmath95 moreover , if @xmath96 then @xmath78 can not be large by the rankin bounds @xcite , and if @xmath97 then @xmath78 is bounded by .",
    "we conclude as follows .",
    "for instance , for @xmath101 we obtain that @xmath102 . partitioning @xmath103 into a number of small segments , we plot the value @xmath104 as a function of @xmath60 evaluated at the nodes of the partition .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig1 ] .",
    "a part of the segment around the maximum appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig2 ] .",
    "this computation gives an indication of the answer , but in principle the value @xmath104 could oscillate between the nodes of the partition .",
    "ruling this out requires perturbation analysis of the sdp problem which is not immediate .",
    "@xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 we need to estimate from above the maximum value of this problem over @xmath110.$ ] accounting for a continuous value set of the parameter in sdp problems is a challenging task .",
    "we approach it by employing the sum - of - squares method .",
    "constraints - impose positivity conditions on some univariate polynomials of @xmath60 for @xmath111 the following sequence of steps transforms the constraints to semidefinite conditions .",
    "observe that a polynomial @xmath112 of degree at most @xmath14 satisfies @xmath113 for @xmath114 if and only if the polynomial of degree at most @xmath115 @xmath116 for all @xmath117 next , a polynomial nonnegative on the entire real axis can be written as a sum of squares , @xmath118 where the @xmath119 are polynomials .",
    "further , by a result of nesterov @xcite , a polynomial @xmath120 of degree @xmath115 is a sum of squares if and only if there exists a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath121 such that @xmath122 where @xmath123 thus , constraints - can be transformed to semidefinite conditions .    as a result , we obtain an sdp problem that can be solved by computer . we solved the resulting problem for @xmath124 using the matlab toolbox sostools @xcite in the yalmip environment @xcite .",
    "an advantage in using sostools is that it accepts @xmath60 as an sdp variable , thereby accounting for all the values of @xmath60 in the segment .",
    "thus , we obtain the value @xmath125 however , this may impose excessive constraints on the value of the sdp problem because all the conditions for different values of @xmath60 are involved at the same time . to work around this accumulation ,",
    "we use a sub - partitioning of the segment @xmath103 into smaller segments . for each of them , sostools outputs the largest value of the minimum of the sdp problem over all @xmath60 in the segment .",
    "it turns out that , in many cases , the maximum of these solutions is smaller than @xmath126 computed directly by the package .",
    "the estimates of the answer computed from the primal problem serve as a guidance of the needed step length of the partition .",
    "the solution of the sum - of - squares sdp optimization problem provides a rigorous proof for the estimates obtained by discretizing the primal problem - . for instance , for @xmath1 we partition @xmath127 into 20 subsegments , finding 276.5 as the maximum value of the dual sdp problem for @xmath128 etc .",
    "the results of the calculation are summarized in the table below .",
    "the part of the table for @xmath129 except for the values of the sdp bound , is from @xcite .",
    "the improvement provided by theorem [ thm : sdp ] over the lp bound is quite substantial even for relatively small dimensions .",
    "the lp bound is above @xmath33 for @xmath130 and is not included starting with @xmath131 the cases @xmath132 and @xmath133 are not resolved by sdp , although for @xmath134 we still obtain an improvement over the harmonic bound .",
    "the value of @xmath51 shown in the table accounts for the largest value of the sdp problem among the possible choices of @xmath51 .",
    "this guarantees that the value sdp@xmath98 is equal to or smaller than the number in the table for all the possible values of the inner products @xmath90 in the point set .",
    "notice that for @xmath132 the sdp bound coincides with the bound .",
    "for @xmath1 the results of @xcite leave two possibilities , @xmath135 and 277 .",
    "the sdp bound resolves this for the former , establishing the corresponding part of the claim in . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig2 ] , the largest value of sdp@xmath98 is attained for @xmath136 and is equal to 276 .",
    "this case corresponds to 276 equiangular lines in @xmath137 with angle @xmath138 , which can be constructed either using strongly regular graphs or the leech lattice ( see @xcite for details ) .          c.  bachoc , d.c .",
