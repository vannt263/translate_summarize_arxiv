    "the detection of ultra high energy ( @xmath0 ev ) cosmic rays using nitrogen fluorescence light emission from extensive air showers ( eas ) is a well established technique , used by the fly s eye @xcite , hires @xcite , and pierre auger observatory @xcite experiments , and planned for the telescope array @xcite , which is presently under construction .",
    "it has also been proposed for the satellite - based euso @xcite and owl @xcite projects .",
    "excitation of atmospheric nitrogen by eas charged particles induces fluorescence emission , mostly in the wavelength range between 300 to 430 nm .",
    "information on the longitudinal eas development can be obtained by fluorescence telescopes by recording the light intensity as a function of time and incoming direction ; this information is related to the primary cosmic ray energy and type .",
    "however , the fluorescence light yield from eas charged particles must be well known at each point within the shower , and corrections applied for atmospheric effects between the shower and the telescope for an accurate primary energy determination .",
    "thus , the intensities of the fluorescence bands should be measured over a range of air pressure and temperature corresponding to altitudes up to several tens of km , the typical elevation of eas development in the atmosphere .",
    "a number of other experiments have made measurements of the fluorescence light yield pertinent to eas .",

    "the uncertainty on the fluorescence light yield is currently one of the main systematic uncertainties on the cosmic ray energy determination by eas experiments which employ the fluorescence technique .",
    "the absolute fluorescence yield is known only at the level of 15% and for a few electron energies .",
    "recent spectral measurements are limited by the use of optical filters , while the early data of bunner are based on measurements with coarse spectral resolution and large systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data reported here are part of a program by the airfly ( air fluorescence yield ) collaboration to measure the fluorescence light yield with significantly improved precision over the electron kinetic energy range from kev to gev using several accelerators .",
    "this paper describes the measurement of the pressure dependence of the relative yields of the fluorescence bands in the wavelength range 284 - 429 nm .",
    "the absolute yield , as well as the temperature and humidity dependence of the fluorescence spectrum , are currently being analysed , and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the relative intensities of 34 fluorescence bands over the wavelength range 284 - 429 nm were measured in dry air at 800 hpa with a high resolution spectrograph .",
    "the pressure dependence of the fluorescence spectrum was also studied from a few hpa up to atmospheric pressure .",
    "the high beam current needed for a measurement of the fluorescence spectrum was provided by a dc beam of 3 mev electrons .",
    "the pressure dependence of the 337 nm band in dry air was measured in a different set - up using a narrow band optical filter and a photomultiplier tube .",
    "we used a 14 mev electron beam for this measurement , which had the advantage of much better stability of the beam position , a small spot size and reduced multiple scattering effects compared to the 3 mev beam .",
    "these beam characteristics were important to reduce the systematic uncertainties .",
    "we measured the collisional quenching reference pressure of the 337 nm band , @xmath2(337 ) , by studying the ratio of fluorescence emission in nitrogen and air . with this method",
    ", we eliminated the bias from undetected light due to secondary electrons escaping the detector s field of view at low pressures .",
    "the collisional quenching reference pressures of the other fluorescence bands were obtained from the pressure dependence of their relative intensities , using @xmath2(337 ) as normalization .",

    "electrons passing through air excite the nitrogen molecules , directly as well as through secondary electrons produced along the path in the gas . nitrogen de - excitation results in a fluorescence spectrum which , in the range 300 to 430  nm , consists mainly of transitions from the so - called second positive system ( 2p ) of molecular nitrogen @xmath3 and the first negative system ( 1n ) of ionised nitrogen molecules @xmath4 . throughout the paper , the notations 2p(@xmath5 ) and 1n(@xmath5 ) , corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite , will be used to indentify the relevant electronic - vibrational transitions .",
    "not all the excited nitrogen molecules emit fluorescence photons , since they may transfer their energy to other molecules through collision .",
    "this quenching process introduces a dependence of the fluorescence emission on the gas pressure and temperature , because the collisional rate depends on the average separation distance and velocity of the molecules .",
    "the process of fluorescence emission induced by electrons in nitrogen gas can be described in terms of fluorescence efficiency @xcite @xcite , namely the ratio of the energy emitted by the excited gas in fluorescence photons to the energy deposited in the gas by the electron .",
    "the fluorescence efficiency of photons of wavelength @xmath8 at a given nitrogen pressure @xmath9 is usually parameterized as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the collisional quenching reference pressure , and @xmath12 is the fluorescence efficiency in absence of collisional quenching ( in the limit @xmath13 the distance between nitrogen molecules becomes very large and they can not de - excite by collisions ) . here ,",
    "the _ fluorescence yield _ is defined as the ratio of the fluorescence efficiency to the photon energy @xmath14 , that is the number of photons emitted by the excited gas per energy deposited by the electron : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",

    "( [ eq : fluoreffair])-([eq : pprimeair ] ) does indeed provide a good description of our data .",
    "the typical arrangement in fluorescence experiments involves a photon detector , e.g. a photomultiplier , viewing a portion of gas volume ( @xmath3 or air ) along the electron path .",
    "the detected signal is thus proportional to the number of fluorescence photons @xmath30 emitted in the detector field of view : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy deposited by the electron in the gas volume viewed by the photon detector .",
    "the energy @xmath32 depends on the specific geometry of the experiment , and can be estimated by a detailed monte carlo simulation , including effects like multiple scattering and secondary electrons .",
    "nevertheless , for a given experimental arrangement , we can write : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the collisional energy loss , @xmath35 is the gas density and @xmath36 is an effective length which takes into account the specific experimental arrangement .",
    "notice that a pressure dependence has been included in @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , as the gas pressure goes down , an increasing fraction of secondary electrons escapes the detector field of view , and correspondingly part of the fluorescence emission is not detected .",
    "the net effect is a reduction of the effective length @xmath37 , which is thus expected to be a decreasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "the number of detected fluorescence photons can then be written : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the specific gas constant , @xmath22 is the gas temperature and the gas equation of state has been used .",

    "the linear dispersion of spectrograph , with the grating used , is 3.2 nm / mm , that gives a wavelength window of about 85 nm .",
    "this means that the air fluorescence spectrum , which extends over more than 100  nm , did not fit in a single wavelength window of the spectrograph .",

    "notice that the observed lineshapes show an asymmetric tail towards smaller wavelengths , due to the convolution of the rotational levels with the finite resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "thus , in general , the integral counts associated with a given band can have contributions also from nearby bands . rather than attempting to disentangle individual band integrals , which would result in additional systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the band intensities were estimated by integrating the ccd counts in a wavelength interval around each band .",
    "an example of the procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectzoom ] .",
    "wavelength intervals up to several nm were used , depending on the distance of nearby bands and the amount of rotational contribution . in any case , most of the signal of each band is contained in only 2 nm . in the following , the wavelength of the main band is used to identify the corresponding wavelength interval .",
    "the measurement of the light intensity in wavelength intervals of nm size is well suited for the purpose of calibration of the cosmic ray fluorescence detection technique , and assigning the full intensity to the main band of the wavelength interval will result in a negligible systematic uncertainty .",
    "the measured fluorescence spectrum contained a small level of background , which was estimated in selected wavelength regions where fluorescence bands were not present .",
    "for each of these background regions , the average number of background counts per wavelength bin was determined . in order to estimate the background level under the fluorescence bands",
    ", a linear interpolation was performed between the measurements of consecutive background wavelength regions .",
    "the procedure gave an estimate of the average number of background counts in each wavelength bin over the full wavelength region .",
    "the background level was found to be approximately constant .",
    "the amount of background under each fluorescence band was determined by summing the estimated average number of background counts for each bin of the wavelength interval associated to the band .",
    "the band intensity was then determined by subtracting the corresponding background .    several fluorescence bands ( 346.3 , 350.0 , 353.7 , 357.7 , 366.1 , and 367.2 nm ) were common to the 284 - 369 nm and the 344 - 429 nm spectrograph s ranges .",
    "the measured intensity of these bands was used to normalize the two spectrograph s ranges .",
    "in fact , any change in the beam intensity or position during the short time ( 30 s ) needed by the spectrograph to move from the first to the second wavelength range would result in a difference in the measured intensity of the common bands .",
