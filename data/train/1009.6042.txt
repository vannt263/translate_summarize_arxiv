    "the existence of dark matter also provides an unambiguous evidence of new physics beyond the standard model .",

    "the stop masses are typically required to be large in order to push the higgs mass above the lep limits , which could lead to significant fine - tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking . to resolve the tension between the lep higgs search limits and the fine - tuning in ewsb , studies have been done in the direction of extending the minimal model or questioning the definition for naturalness @xcite .",
    "we could , however , also take this tension as an indication that the data is pointing us to a particular region of the mssm parameter space that the lep null results can be accommodated while the fine - tuning in the higgs potential could be minimized .",
    "this so - called  golden \" region was explored in ref .",
    "it is shown that such golden region is characterized by a small value of the @xmath11 parameter , as well as relatively small soft masses for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and a relatively large stop trilinear @xmath14-term @xmath15 .",

    "the stop mass eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 in golden region are relatively light ( sub - tev ) with a large mass splitting .",
    "one direct consequence of this large mass splitting is that the decay of @xmath18 is kinematically allowed .",

    "the higgs searches at the lep gave a lower limit on the sm higgs mass as @xcite @xmath46 which can also be applied to the light cp - even higgs boson in the decoupling region of the mssm parameter space .",
