    "in this paper we would like to review one of outstanding open problems of quantum physics ",
    "rigorous understanding of the energy  momentum spectrum of homogeneous bose gas at zero temperature .",
    "we describe various rigorous and heuristic arguments about its shape .",
    "in particular , we discuss a number of versions of the so - called bogoliubov approach .",
    "we use the main idea of this approach to give rigorous upper bounds on the energy - momentum spectrum of the bose gas .",
    "there exists little rigorous work on this subject .",
    "we think that mathematicians avoid this topic not only because of its difficulty .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to formulate questions in this domain that are , on one hand , physically relevant , and on the other hand , mathematically clean and precise .",
    "we try to ask a number of such questions , some of them rather ambitious , but some , perhaps , within the reach of present methods .",
    "we think that rigorous methods of spectral analysis and operator theory could be very helpful in clarifying this subject .",
    "one can distinguish two possible approaches to the bose gas at positive density : `` canonical ''  fixing the density @xmath2  and `` grand - canonical ''  fixing the chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "in most of our paper we will concentrate on the latter setting .",
    "nevertheless , in the introduction , as well as in section [ fixed number of particles ] we will stick to the canonical approach .",
    "we suppose that the 2-body potential of an interacting bose gas is described by a real function @xmath4 defined on @xmath5 , satisfying @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 decays at infinity sufficiently fast .",
    "a typical assumption on the potentials that we have in mind in our paper is @xmath8 where the fourier transform of @xmath4 is given by @xmath9 potentials satisfying ( [ posi ] ) will be called repulsive .",
    "note , however , that a large part of our paper does not use directly any specific assumption on the potentials .",
    "@xmath10-body schrdinger hamiltonian of the homogeneous bose gas acts on the hilbert space @xmath11 ( symmetric square integrable functions on @xmath12 and is described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 and the momentum operator @xmath14 @xmath15 is a collection of @xmath16 commuting self - adjoint operators , hence we can ask about the properties of their joint spectrum , called the energy  momentum spectrum .",
    "( [ sch4 ] ) describes however only a finite number of particles in an infinite space .",
    "we would like to investigate homogeneous bose gas at positive density .",
    "it is a little problematic how to model such a system .",
    "a natural solution would be restricting ( [ sch4 ] ) to e.g. @xmath17^d$ ] , the @xmath18-dimensional cubic box of side length @xmath19 , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this will , however , destroy its translational invariance .",
    "therefore , following the accepted although somewhat unphysical tradition , we consider the bose gas on a torus .",
    "this means in particular that the potential @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the discrete momentum variable and @xmath22 is the volume of the box .",
    "note that @xmath23 is periodic with respect to the domain @xmath24 , and @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the system on a torus is described by the hamiltonian @xmath27 acting on the space @xmath28 ( symmetric square integrable functions on @xmath29 ) .",
    "the laplacian is assumed to have periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath30 the _ ground state energy in the box _ : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the spectrum of an operator @xmath33 .",
    "the total momentum is given by the vector of operators @xmath34 its joint spectrum equals @xmath35 .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 and @xmath37 commute with each other .",
    "therefore we can define their joint spectrum @xmath38 which will be called the _ energy - momentum spectrum in the box_. by the _ excitation spectrum in the box _ we will mean @xmath39 .    for @xmath40 , we can define the hamiltonian @xmath41 to be the restriction of @xmath36 to the supspace of @xmath42 and _ infimum of the excitation spectrum ( ies ) in the box _ as @xmath43 by the _ infimum of the energy - momentum spectrum in the box _ we will mean @xmath44 .",
    "it is believed that the properties of the bose gas simplify in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it means that one should fix @xmath45 , take the number of particles equal to @xmath46 , and then pass to the limit @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we know , the hamiltonians @xmath47 do not have a limit as self - adjoint operators .",
    "one can hope , however , that the ies has some kind of a limit .",
    "mathematically it is not obvious how to define this limit , since for finite @xmath19 the ies is defined on the lattice @xmath48 and in thermodynamic limit it should be defined on @xmath5 . below we",
    "propose one of possible definitions of the ies in thermodynamic limit .    for @xmath49 and @xmath45",
    ", we take @xmath50 and set @xmath51 this gives a lower bound on the ies for the momenta @xmath52 in the window in the momentum space around @xmath0 of diameter @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 increases as @xmath55 becomes smaller .",
    "the _ ies in the thermodynamic limit _ is defined as its supremum ( or , equivalently , its limit ) as @xmath56 : @xmath57    under assumption ( [ posi ] ) it is easy to prove that @xmath30 is finite and @xmath58 ( see theorem [ thm ] and proposition [ prop1 ] ) .    [ conj1a ] we expect that for a large class of repulsive potentials the following statements hold true :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath59 is continuous .",
    "2 .   let @xmath60 . if @xmath26 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , we have that @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",
    "4 .   there exists the limit @xmath68 .",
    "the function @xmath69 is subadditive , that is , @xmath70 .",
    "statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be interpreted as some kind of a `` spectral thermodynamic limit in the canonical approach '' .",
    "note that if ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are true around @xmath71 , then we can say that there is `` no gap in the excitation spectrum '' .",
    "the properties ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the bose gas were predicted by landau in the 40 s .",
    "shortly thereafter , they were derived by a somewhat heuristic argument by bogoliubov @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) is commonly believed to be responsible for the superfluidity of the bose gas .",
    "more precisely , it is argued that because of ( 3 ) a drop of bose gas travelling at speed less than @xmath72 will experience no friction .",
    "this argument is described e.g. in the course by landau - lifshitz @xcite and in @xcite , see also section [ superfluidity ] .",
    "note that in dimension @xmath73 the statement ( 3 ) should be replaced by    ( 3) if @xmath73 , then @xmath74    the statement ( 3) has a simple rigorous proof , which we will describe in our paper .",
    "it implies that in dimension @xmath73 the excitation spectrum is periodic with the period @xmath75 .",
    "it follows by the well known argument that involves boosting all particles simultaneously by the velocity @xmath76 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    excitation spectrum with the property described by ( 4 )",
    "is often described as _",
    "phononic _ and the excitations with such a spectrum are called _",
    "phonons_. one also expects that the parameter @xmath77 coincides with the speed of sound  a parameter in principle macroscopically measurable .",
    "let us describe a heuristic argument for ( 5 ) .",
    "suppose that excitations can be described by certain elementary quasiparticles with a dispersion relation @xmath78 .",
    "we assume that the state consisting of quasiparticles with momenta @xmath79 has the excitation energy @xmath80 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the ies is the subadditive hull of @xmath81 , that is @xmath82 which is the largest subadditive function less than @xmath83 . in appendix [ a00 ]",
    "we describe a somewhat more elaborate , but still heuristic , argument that seems to indicate that , in thermodynamic limit , the bose gas has a subadditive excitation spectrum .",
    "note that free bose gas does not satisfy conjecture [ conj1a ] . in this case @xmath84 and @xmath85 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1.1 ]        there are not so many subadditive functions",
    ". there exist , however , subadditive functions , which satisfy the properties described in our conjecture in ( 3 ) or ( 3) , and in ( 4 ) .",
    "we discuss basic properties of subadditive functions in appendix [ a0 ] .",
    "we could not find these facts in the literature , although they probably belong to the folk knowledge .      to our experience , most physicists interested in this subject ( but not all )",
    "would agree that one should expect conjecture [ conj1a ] ( as well as the analogous conjecture [ conj1 ] formulated in the grand - canonical setting ) to be true .",
    "let us start with a brief account of experimental evidence for these conjectures .            theoretically , the cross - section for neutron scattering against a droplet of helium iv at zero temperature is approximately proportional to the so - called van hove formfactor @xmath86 ( @xcite , see also ( [ formfactor ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath86 is a measure of the density of excitations of the bose gas at energy @xmath87 and momentum @xmath0 at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 is zero below the curve @xmath88 .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that more is true : @xmath86 should be nonzero everywhere above the curve @xmath88 .",
    "if in addition conjecture [ conj1a ] is true , then the lower boundary of the support of @xmath86 should satisfy ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of this conjecture .    to our understanding , within experimental accuracy ,",
    "experiments on helium iv at low temperatures seem to confirm the above theoretical expectations .",
    "actually , experiments seem to say more than this . at least for low momenta , one observes a sharp peak of @xmath86 along a curve similar to @xmath78 at fig .",
    "[ fig1.2 ] , see @xcite and fig 1 of @xcite .",
    "this curve is interpreted as the dispersion relation of a quasiparticle ( elementary excitation spectrum ) .",
    "these quasiparticles are called phonons for small momenta and rotons around the local minimum of the dispersion relation . to our understanding , experiments indicate that below the subadditive hull of the elementary excitation spectrum the value of @xmath86 drops down substantially .",
    "( in the case of fig . [ fig1.2 ] , this subadditive hull equals @xmath89 ) .    experiments involving excited phonon states are usually successfully interpreted in terms of multi - quasiparticle states whose momenta and energies are additive @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the energy of multi - quasiparticle states lies above @xmath89 .",
    "a similar picture arises in the case of bose - einstein ( be ) condensates of alcalic metals .",
    "for example , the reader can consult fig . 2 of @xcite , which shows the quasiparticle spectrum of the be condensate of @xmath90rb around zero temperature .",
    "compared to helium iv , the main difference is the absence of the rotonic part of the elementary excitation spectrum , see fig . [ fig1.3 ] .    of course , it is difficult to interpret real experiments in terms of rigorous statements .",
    "the setup that we describe in this paper does not apply in all its details to realistic be condensates .",
    "first of all , both in helium iv and alcalic metals , the potential has typically an attractive part and a hard core .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking it does not belong to the class that we would like to consider in this paper .    in the case of helium iv",
    ", the situation is further complicated by the fact that the schrdinger operator of the form ( [ sch4 ] ) is not believed to describe it adequately ",
    "@xmath91-body interactions are probably relevant .",
    "this problem does not appear in be condensates of alcalic metals , where apparently one can assume that only 2-body interactions play the role .",
    "be condensates of alcalic metals have a different conceptual problem absent in the case of helium iv : they do not represent the true ground state but only a metastable state .",
    "there are many theoretical physics papers devoted to the bose gas . to our surprise",
    ", their authors usually avoid making precise statements or conjectures about the excitation spectrum of the bose gas .",
    "( a notable exception is @xcite , where a definition of the ies similar to ( [ ies ] ) can be found ) .    in @xcite bogoliubov",
    "proposed an approximation , which implies that the bose gas should be described by elementary excitations with the spectrum @xmath92 within this approximation , the ies equals @xmath93 , the subadditive hull of @xmath94 ( see ( [ epsilon ] ) ) , which has the properties described in conjecture [ conj1a ] .",
    "note that if we replace the potential @xmath4 with @xmath95 and the density @xmath2 with @xmath96 ( with a positive @xmath97 ) , then neither @xmath94 nor @xmath93 depend on @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , it is natural to conjecture that @xmath93 describes the true ies in the weak coupling / large density limit .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath98 be the ies for the potential @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "then for a large class of repulsive potentials we have @xmath99 [ conj-1 ]    note that conjecture [ conj-1 ] is certainly wrong in dimension @xmath73 , because of ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we do not know complete proofs of a statement similar to conjectures [ conj1a ] , [ conj-1 ] , as well as their grand - canonical analogs described later on in our paper .",
    "we believe that to prove or disprove them would be an interesting subject for research in mathematical physics .",
    "many theoretical works on the energy - momentum spectrum of the bose gas instead of the correct hamiltonian @xmath36 ( or its second - quantized version @xmath100 and the grand - canonical version @xmath101 ) consider its modifications .",
    "they either replace the zero mode by a @xmath1-number or drop some of the terms , or do both modifications @xcite .",
    "these hamiltonians have no independent justification apart from being approximations to the correct hamiltonian in some uncontrolled way .",
    "let us stress that in our paper we are mostly interested in the correct hamiltonian and not its modifications : all our statements will be related either to @xmath36 or to the grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath102 ( the second quantization of @xmath103 ) .",
    "the paper is divided into several sections and appendices .",
    "the individual sections use sometimes slightly different notation and are devoted to different apsects of the bose gas .",
    "section [ fixed number of particles ] is devoted to some facts about bose gas that are naturally formulated in the canonical approach , where we start with a definite number of particles and go to thermodynamic limit keeping the density fixed .",
    "the later part of the paper , where we use the grand - canonical approach , is independent of this section .",
    "we start with a discussion of the galileian covariance in a finite box with periodic boundary consitions .",
    "we believe that this is relevant if one wants to understand the physics of the bose gas .",
    "even though what we present is elementary , we did not find most of it in the literature .    in subsection [ s2a ]",
    "we discuss the case of dimension @xmath73 .",
    "we prove that the excitation spectrum is periodic in momentum .",
    "this fact is known to some experts and we do not claim its discovery ",
    "nevertheless , we have never seen it explicitly stated in the literature .    in subsection [ superfluidity ]",
    "we describe an argument that links the properties of the excitation spectrum to superfluid behavior .",
    "the argument that we describe is slightly different from the one usually stated in the literature @xcite  in particular it applies to systems confined to a finite volume .",
    "one of the most imporant quantities in in superfluidity is the so - called critical velocity .",
    "there are several non - equivalent definitions of this concept in thermodynamic limit .",
    "we argue , that to obtain the definition that is relevant for superfluidity one should first take thermodynamic limit for the excitation spectrum , and only then compute the critical velocity .",
    "in subsection [ feynmann s ansatz ] we present the variational ansatz due to bijls @xcite and feynmann @xcite for the excitation spectrum .    in subsection [ dependence of the energy on external potential ]",
    "we describe the ( non - rigorous but interesting ) argument due to onsager @xcite that indicates the phononic character of the excitation spectrum obtained by this ansatz .",
    "our presentation follows that of a recent paper @xcite .",
    "section [ variational approach based on squeezed states ] is the central part of our paper .",
    "starting with this section , we switch to the grand - canonical setting .",
    "this means that we allow the number of particles to vary and we fix the chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "we also use the formalism of second quantization .    in subsection [ s2b ]",
    "we describe the formalism and formulate conjecture [ conj1 ] , the grand - canonical analog of conjecture [ conj1a ] .    in subsection [ number substitution ]",
    ", we discuss the hamiltonian obtained by a @xmath1-number substitution of the zero mode .",
    "we describe the theorem of lieb , seiringer and yngvason @xcite saying that this approximate hamiltonian gives the correct energy density in thermodynamic limit .",
    "note that the result of @xcite is more general , it concerns an arbitrary temperature .",
    "our presentation sticks to the zero temperature , which allows for some minor simplifications .    in subsection [ s3 ]",
    "we describe the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "its original form was formulated in the canonical setting of fixed density in the second - quantized formalism .",
    "we follow its grand - canonical version , which can be traced back to beliaev @xcite and hugenholz - pines @xcite , see also a recent review paper by zagrebnov and bru @xcite .",
    "even though this is a classic reasoning , our presentation seems to be somewhat different from and more satisfactory than what we have seen in the literature .",
    "its first step is a variational problem involving coherent states .",
    "the second step is the bogoliubov translation and rotation adapted to the resulting approximate ground state .",
    "our reasoning does not involve the @xmath1-number substitution : we treat the zero mode quantum mechanically .",
    "one can try to improve on bogoliubov s approximation by looking for the minimum of the energy among translation invariant squeezed states . to our knowledge , in the context of the bose gas this idea first appeared in the paper of robinson @xcite .",
    "robinson considered a slightly more general class of states ",
    "quasi - free states .",
    "he noticed , however , that in the case he looked at it is sufficient to restrict to pure quasi - free states , which coincide with squeezed states .",
    "one should mention also @xcite , where a variational bound on the pressure of bose gas in a positive temperature is derived by using quasi - free states . in the literature this approach often goes under the name of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method .",
    "only an upper bound to the ground state energy is considered in @xcite .",
    "we go one step further : we show how this method can be extended to obtain upper bounds on the infimum of the energy - momentum spectrum by using one - particle excitations over squeezed states .    after finding the minimizing squeezed vector @xmath104 ,",
    "it is natural to express the hamiltonian in the new creation / annihilation operators @xmath105 , for which the new approximate ground state is a fock vacuum .",
    "we show that the resulting quadratic hamiltonian has no terms involving @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath110    this new form of the hamiltonian yields immediately an interesting estimate on the energy - momentum spectrum .",
    "in fact , the vectors @xmath111 have precisely the momentum @xmath0 and the energy equal to @xmath112 .",
    "one could ask how good is this estimate .",
    "it turns out that it has a serious drawback .",
    "as we show in subsection [ thermodynamic limit of the fixed point equation ] , under quite general circumstances we have @xmath113 .    perhaps , this is the most important ( even if negative ) finding of our paper .",
    "it implies that at the bottom of its spectrum 1-particle excitations over a squeezed state are poor test functions for the excitation spectrum .    in the literature , the existence of a gap in various approximation schemes that try to improve on the original bogoliubov",
    "s one has been noticed by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge those authors did not consider the correct hamiltonian , but always used one of its distorted versions .",
    "the hilbert space of the homogeneous bose gas can be naturally factorized into the tensor product of an infinite family of hilbert spaces for various values of the momenta .",
    "variational ansatzes involving translation invariant squeezed states , as well as particle excitations over the squeezed states have a common feature  they are factorized with respect to this tensor product .",
    "we call such states _ uncorrelated_. one can pose a question : how good are uncorrelated states as variational test functions in many body problems ?",
    "it seems to us that they have serious drawbacks  in particular , we conjecture that they typically give spectrum with an energy gap .    in section [ perturbative approach ]",
    "we discuss approaches to the bose gas based on perturbation theory .",
    "we would like to treat the coupling constant @xmath97 as a small parameter , keeping the chemical potential @xmath3 fixed .    in subsection [ perturbative approach based on the bogoliubov method ]",
    "we describe a naive splitting of the hamiltonian into a main part and a perturbation based on the usual bogoliubov approach .",
    "unfortunately , this approach seems to fail because of a serious infrared problem .",
    "we also formulate conjecture [ conj-1a ] , which is the grand - canonical analog of conjecture [ conj-1 ] and is suggested by bogoliubov s approximation .    in subsection [ perturbative approach based on improved bogoliubov method ]",
    "we propose a certain systematic procedure for perturbation expansion , which avoids the infrared problem .",
    "this procedure uses ( [ equ1 ] ) as the starting point for the expansion .",
    "the 3rd and 4th order term are treated as perturbations .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it does not drop any terms from the hamiltonian .",
    "all the works on the bose gas based on perturbation theory @xcite that we know involve the @xmath1-number substitution .",
    "this substitution , even if justified for the energy density @xcite , is unfounded for finer quantities such as the infimum of the excitation spectrum .",
    "our perturbative procedure does not involve distorting the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , it is superior from the physical point of view .",
    "in section [ a priori estimates ] we describe various inequalities on the bose gas that can be proved rigorously .",
    "these results are consistent with the absence of the energy gap and the phononic form of the excitation spectrum .",
    "they are obtained by relatively simple methods , involving especially the so - called @xmath114-sum rule .",
    "our presentation is based on the work of bogoliubov @xcite and on results presented by stringari @xcite .    in appendices we present some background material , to make our paper accessible to a larger audience .",
    "in appendix [ a2 ] we describe technical computations .",
    "let us make some additional remarks about the literature of the subject .",
    "the case of dimension @xmath73 and repulsive delta interactions has been studied in detail .",
    "girardeau @xcite studied the case of `` infinite '' coupling ( which amounts to the dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "the case of an arbitrary positive coupling constant was studied in @xcite , where arguments for the absence of a gap and the phononic shape of the excitation spectrum in the thermodynamic limit are given .",
    "@xcite gives a full rigorous proof for the linearity of the excitation spectrum in thermodynamic limit for girardeau s model .",
    "note , however , that the 1-dimensional case is believed to be quite different from the case @xmath66 .",
    "there exists a large literature on the energy density of the bose gas .",
    "the energy density can be defined as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is kept fixed . there",
    "exist derivations of the asymptotics of @xmath117 in dimension @xmath118 for small @xmath2 going back to @xcite .",
    "this asymptotics is not restricted to small potentials  it covers also the case of hard - core potentials .",
    "one can show rigorously ( see @xcite and references therein ) that the leading term of this asymptotics correctly describes the energy density .",
    "similar results can be shown in dimension @xmath119 .",
    "note that the energy density is easier to study than the infimum of the excitation spectrum .",
    "besides , it does not capture some interesting physical phenomena the excitation spectrum is responsible for .",
    "note also that the above mentioned results involve the following limit : the scattering length is kept fixed ( this can be achieved e.g. by fixing the potential ) and the density goes to zero . in our paper we usually consider a different limit : the chemical potential is kept fixed and the coupling constant in front of the potential goes to zero .",
    "one can have various opinions comparing the physical relevance of the two limits . in any case",
    ", the latter limit seems more appropriate if one wants to capture the phononic character of the excitation spectrum .",
    "another direction of rigorous research involves studying the so - called gross - pitaevski limit .",
    "again it concerns mostly the dimension @xmath118 .",
    "the quantity that is kept fixed is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the scattering length and @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "the gross - pitaevski limit is usually presented with a fixed @xmath19 and the scattering length @xmath121 going to zero , which is achieved by an appropriate scaling of the potential .",
    "equivalently , one can fix the potential , consider @xmath26 . and scale the density as @xmath122 as @xmath26 . in this limit , lieb , seiringer and yngvason have obtained a number of interesting and precise results @xcite . in particular , they are able to approximate the behavior of the @xmath10-body system by a non - linear effective equation  the gross - pitaevski equation .",
    "note , however , that in this limit it is difficult to say something interesting about the excitation spectrum , because the density , and hence the speed of sound and the critical velocity , go to zero .",
    "the result of @xcite ( see also theorem 5.3 of @xcite ) can be interpreted as the positivity of the critical velocity in finite volume .",
    "the critical velocity , as understood in this result , goes to zero in thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is presumably far too low to fully account for the physical phenomenon of superfluidity , see subsection [ sub - alpha ] for a discussion .    finally , let us note that there exists a number of interesting rigorous results about bose gas in positive temperatures @xcite",
