    "numerous post - mortem studies have shown that neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques characteristic of alzheimer s disease ( ad ) are prominent within the hippocampus of individuals with mild dementia of the alzheimer s type ( dat ) and that the distribution of these neuropathological markers becomes more widespread to include several regions of the neocortex as the disease process progresses [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques characteristic of ad are associated with neuronal damage and death [ 8 ] .",
    "furthermore , macroscopic gray matter losses from the accumulation of microscopic scale neuronal destruction are detectable in living subjects using currently available magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging .",
    "specifically , volume losses within the hippocampus [ 9 - 14 ] have recently been reported in subjects with mild - to - moderate ad . in an unusual study where the antemortem mr scans and post - mortem material was available for the same subjects , hippocampal volume losses were shown to be powerful antemortem predictors of ad neuropathology [ 15 ] .",
    "progressive atrophy of the entire brain has been observed in ad cases [ 16 ] .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the human brain and the non - uniform distribution of ad neuropathology early in the course of disease , detailed examination of specific brain regions known to be affected early in the ad disease process ( e.g. , hippocampus ) may be preferred for distinguishing preclinical and very mild forms of ad from normal aging [ 17 - 19 ] .",
    "methods developed in the field of computational anatomy ( ca ) that enable quantification of brain structure volumes and shapes between and within groups of individuals with and without various neurological diseases  have emerged from several groups in recent years [ 20 - 25 ] . based on the mathematical principles of general pattern theory",
    "[ 18 , 19 , 23 , 26 , 27 ] , these methods combine image - based diffeomorphic maps between mr scans with representations of brain structures as smooth manifolds .",
    "because of their high repeatability and sensitivity to changes in neuroanatomical shapes , they can be especially sensitive to abnormalities of brain structures associated with early forms of ad . using such methods",
    ", we previously demonstrated that the combined assessment of hippocampal volume loss and shape deformity optimally distinguished subjects with very mild dat from both elder nondemented subjects and younger healthy subjects [ 10 ] .",
    "these methods also allowed us to demonstrate that hippocampal shape deformities associated with very mild dat and nondemented aging were distinct [ 28 ] .",
    "these methods were also extended to quantify changes in neuroanatomical volumes and shapes within the same individuals over time [ 29 ] .",
    "other longitudinal neuroimaging analysis of hippocampal structures in individuals with ad have also emerged [ 30 - 41 ] .",
    "an important task in ca  is the study of neuroanatomical variability .",
    "the anatomic model is a quadruple @xmath8 ) consisting of @xmath9 the template coordinate space ( in @xmath10 ) , defined as the union of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3-dimensional manifolds , @xmath11 a set of diffeomorphic transformations on @xmath9 , @xmath12 the space of anatomies is the orbit of a template anatomy @xmath13 under @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the family of probability measures on @xmath14 . in this framework ,",
    "a geodesic @xmath16 \\to { \\cal g}$ ] is computed where each point @xmath17 $ ] is a diffeomorphism of the domain @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of the template image @xmath13 along path is given by @xmath18 such that the end point of the geodesic connects the template @xmath13 to the target @xmath19 via @xmath20 .",
    "thus , anatomical variability in the target is encoded by these geodesic transformations when a template is fixed .",
    "furthermore , geodesic curves induce metric distances between the template and the target shapes in the orbit as follows .",
    "the diffeomorphisms are constructed as a flow of ordinary differential equations @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath23 the identity map , and associated vector fields , @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the optimal velocity vector field parameterizing the geodesic path is found by solving @xmath25 where @xmath26 , the hilbert space of smooth vector fields with norm @xmath27 defined through a differential operator enforcing smoothness .",
    "the length of the minimal length path through the space of transformations connecting the given anatomical configurations in @xmath13 and @xmath19 defines a metric distance between anatomical shapes in @xmath13 and @xmath19 via @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the optimizer calculated from the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping ( lddmm ) algorithm [ 42 ] . here",
    ", the metric distance does not have any units .",
    "the construction of such a metric space allows one to quantify similarities and differences between anatomical shapes in the orbit .",
    "this is the vision laid out by darcy w. thompson almost one hundred years ago .",
    "figure [ fig : change - in - d - diffeo - flow ] exemplifies the change in the metric distance during the evolution of the diffeomorphic map from the template shape to the target shape .",
    "the notion of mathematical biomarker in the form of metric distance can be used in different ways .",
    "one is to generate metric distances of shapes relative to a template [ 42 , 43 ] .",
    "another is to generate metric distances between each shape within a collection [ 44 ] .",
    "the latter approach allows for sophisticated pattern classification analysis ; it is however computationally expensive .",
    "we present an analysis based on the former approach which could provide a powerful tool in analyzing subtle shape changes over time with considerably less computational load .",
    "this approach may allow detecting the subtle morphometric changes observed in the hippocampus in dat subjects in particular for those previously analyzed [ 29 , 45 ] .",
    "these studies compared rates of change in hippocampal volume and shape in subjects with very mild dat and matched ( for age and gender ) nondemented subjects .",
    "the change in hippocampal shape over time was defined as a residual vector field resulting from rigid - body motion registration , and changes in patterns along hippocampal surfaces were visualized and analyzed via a statistical measure of individual and group change in hippocampal shape over time and used to distinguish between the subject groups .",
    "hence the motivation to analyze lddmm generated metric distances between binary hippocampus images at baseline and at follow - up with respect to the same template hippocampus image .",
    "that is , the template was compared again , and not propagated between time points .",
    "one might wonder why we do not track changes within a subject directly , rather than via a reference template , as it could give a more sensitive measure of shape change since the small difference in shape would make finding correspondence more accurate .",
    "although we have considered doing this , the difficulty is that since the template ( or origin ) is different for each longitudinal computation , how to correctly perform statistical comparison of group change is not completely settled .",
    "this is actively being developed by using the concept of `` parallel transport '' [ 46 , 47 ] . in this study , we compute and analyze metric distances based on the data used in [ 29 ] .",
    "we briefly describe the data set in section 2.1 , computation of metric distances via lddmm in section 2.2 , statistical methods we employ in section 2.3 , and results and findings in section 3 , which include descriptive summary statistics of the metric distances , comparison of metric distances of hippocampi of non - demented subjects and subjects with very mild dementia , correlation between metric distances , comparison of distributions of metric distances , and discriminative power of metric distances .",
    "we perform similar analysis on hippocampal volumes in section 4 , compare volumes and lddmm distances in section 5 , and analyze annual percentage rate of change in volumes and distances in section 6 . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the use of metric distances for baseline - followup studies , group comparisons , and discrimination analysis .",
    "detailed description of subjects can be found in [ 29 ] where 18 very mild dat subjects ( clinical dementia rating scale , cdr0.5 ) and 26 age - matched nondemented controls ( cdr0 ) were each scanned approximately two years apart .",
    "clinical dementia rating ( cdr ) scale assessments which detect the severity of dementia symptoms were performed annually in all subjects by experienced clinicians without reference to neuropsychological tests or in - vivo neuroimaging data . the experienced clinician conducted semi - structured interviews with an informant and the subject to assess the subject s cognitive and functional performance ;",
    "a neurological examination was also obtained .",
    "the clinician determined the presence or absence of dementia and , when present , its severity with the cdr .",
    "overall cdr scores of 0 indicate no dementia , while cdr scores of 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 3 indicate very mild , mild , moderate and severe dementia , respectively [ 48 ] .",
    "cdr assessments have been shown to have an inter - rater reliability of @xmath30 ( weighted kappa coefficient [ 49 ] @xmath31 of 0.87 ) [ 50 ] , and this high degree of inter - rater reliability has been confirmed in multi - center dementia studies [ 51 ] .",
    "elderly subjects with no clinical evidence of dementia ( i.e. , cdr0 subject ) have been confirmed with normal brains at autopsy with 80% accuracy ; i.e. , approximately 20% of such individuals show evidence of ad  [ 52 ] .",
    "cdr0.5 subjects have subtle cognitive impairment , and 93% of them progress to more severe stages of illness ( i.e. , cdr @xmath32 0.5 ) and show neuropathological signs of ad at autopsy ( [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] , and [ 52 ] ) .",
    "although elsewhere the cdr0.5 individuals in our sample may be considered to have mci [ 55 ] , they fulfill our diagnostic criteria for very mild dat and at autopsy overwhelmingly have neuropathologic ad [ 56 ] .",
    "a summary of subject information is listed in table [ tab : summary - stat - dist ] .",
    "the scans were obtained using a magnetom sp-4000 1.5 tesla imaging system , a standard head coil , and a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo ( mprage ) sequence . the mprage sequence ( tr / te - 10/4 , acq - 1 , matrix - @xmath33 , scanning time - 11.0 min ) produced 3d data with a @xmath34 in - plane resolution and 1 _ mm _ slice thickness across the entire cranium .",
    "a neuroanatomical template was produced using an mr image from an additional elder control ( i.e. , cdr0 or non - demented ) subject ( male , age = 69 ) . the choice and a detailed description of the template is provided in [ 57 ] .",
    "the subject selected to produce this template was obtained from the same source as the other subjects in the study , but was not otherwise included in the data analysis .",
    "data used are the left and right hippocampal surfaces in the template scan created from expert - produced manual outlines using methods previously described [ 28,58 ] , and the left and right hippocampal surfaces of each subject generated at baseline and follow - up .",
    "these surfaces were converted to binary hippocampus volumetric images by flood filling the inside of the surface and giving it label 1 , and the outside of the surface was labeled as 0 , or background .",
    "each individual hippocampal surface was first scaled by a factor of 2 and aligned with the template surface , which was also scaled by a factor of 2 , via a rigid - body rotation and translation before converting to volumetric binary images . in",
    "[ 58 ] we showed that mapping accuracy could be enhanced at higher resolution because of smaller voxels  voxels at the periphery of the structure ( i.e. , surface ) account for much more of the structural volume at @xmath35 voxel resolution versus @xmath36 .",
    "since then we have adapted this as part of the standard mapping procedure .",
    "these surfaces were then converted into binarized image of dimension @xmath37 with voxel resolutions of @xmath38 followed by smoothing by a gaussian filter of @xmath39-voxel window and one voxel standard deviation to smooth out the edges for lddmm , which was then applied to each template - subject pair to compute metric distances , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , in each hemisphere at baseline ( @xmath42 ) and at follow - up ( @xmath43 ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : generation - d - baseline - followup ] .",
    "controlling for brain size is important because people with bigger brains tend to have bigger hippocampus and we want our results to not reflect that very uninteresting fact ; we inherently correct for brain size by first rigid - aligning the subject brain to the prototype brain prior to lddmm .",
    "segmentation of hippocampal mri shapes across subjects , especially in diseased states , is a challenging problem .",
    "however the accuracy of the segmentation is not the point of this paper and has been demonstrated before [ 10 , 57 , 58 ] .",
    "in addition to the metric distances , our data set also consists of the following variables : gender , age , education in years ( these variables are used for controlling the confounding affects of these factors on hippocampus morphometry , so the subjects are taken to be similar or evenly distributed in these variables ) .",
    "furthermore , we have brain and intracranial volumes at baseline and followup , and hippocampus volumes for left and right hippocampi at baseline and follow - up .",
    "metric distances between the binary images and the template image are obtained by computing diffeomorphisms between the images .",
    "computation and analysis of these diffeomorphic mappings have been previously described [ 57 ] .",
    "diffeomorphisms are estimated via the variational problem that , in the space of smooth velocity vector fields @xmath44 on domain @xmath9 , takes the form [ 42 ] : @xmath45 the optimizer of this cost generates the optimal change of coordinates @xmath46 upon integration @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where the subscript @xmath49 in @xmath50 is used to explicitly denote the dependence of @xmath51 on the associated velocity field @xmath49 . enforcing a sufficient amount of smoothness on the elements of the space @xmath44 of allowable velocity vector fields ensures that the solution to the differential equation @xmath52,\\;v_t \\in v$ ] is in the space of diffeomorphisms  [ 59 , 60 ] .",
    "the required smoothness is enforced by defining the norm on the space @xmath44 of smooth velocity vector fields through a differential operator @xmath53 of the type @xmath54 where @xmath55 in 3-dimensional space such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the standard @xmath58 norm for square integrable functions defined on @xmath9 .",
    "the gradient of this cost is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the determinant of the jacobian matrix for @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a compact self - adjoint operator @xmath65 uniquely defined by @xmath66 such that for any smooth vector field @xmath67 , @xmath68 holds .",
    "the metric distance is then calculated via equation ( 2 ) .",
    "first , we investigate what lddmm metric distance measures and how it is related to hippocampus , brain , and intracranial volumes .",
    "that is , as a compound measure of morphometry , how much of the metric distance is related to shape and size and how it is associated with the volume , which is mostly a measure of size .",
    "along this line , we provide the correlation between volume and metric distance measures by the pairs plots at baseline and follow - up of left and right hippocampi .",
    "furthermore , we perform a principal component analysis ( pca ) on metric distance and volumes to characterize the major traits these quantities measure . then we provide a statistical methodology for the analysis of lddmm distances .",
    "we compute and interpret simple summary statistics , such as , mean , standard deviation ( sd ) , minimum , first quartile ( @xmath69 ) , median , third quartile ( @xmath70 ) , and maximum for @xmath71 .",
    "then we apply repeated measures analysis of metric distances with diagnosis group as main effect and timepoint as the repeated factor , side ( i.e. , hemisphere ) as main effect and timepoint as the repeated factor , and diagnosis group as main effect and side - by - timepoint as the repeated factor , since there are within - subject dependence of metric distances for left and right hemispheres and at baseline and follow - up .",
    "we apply four possible competing models each assuming a different variance - covariance structure to obtain the model that best fit to our data set .",
    "the first model assumes compound symmetry , in which the diagonals ( i.e. , the variances ) are equal , and so are the off diagonals ( i.e. , the covariances ) .",
    "the other three models assume unstructured , autoregressive ( ar ) , and autoregressive heterogeneous variances , respectively . in the unstructured model ,",
    "each variance and covariance term is different , in the ar model , the variances are assumed to be equal but the covariances change by time , and in the arh model , the variances are also different and the covariances change by time .",
    "the corresponding variance - covariance ( var - cov ) structures [ 61 - 63 ] for the models are shown in table [ tab : var - cov - for - repeatedmeasuresanova ] , where @xmath72 is the common variance term , @xmath73 is the variance for repeated factor @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the covariance between repeated factors @xmath74 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the correlation coefficient of first order in an autoregressive model .",
    "we use various model selection criteria ( akaike information criterion ( aic ) , bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , log - likelihood ) to compare competing models to see which model best fits our data [ 64 ] .    for post - hoc comparison of cdr0.5 vs cdr0 ,",
    "our null hypothesis for the comparison of diagnosis groups , cdr0 and cdr0.5 , is @xmath78 for each baseline left , baseline right , and follow - up left , follow - up right hippocampi . for the @xmath79-test , among the underlying assumptions",
    "are the normality of the distributions and homogeneity of the variances of the independent samples .",
    "we employ lilliefor s test of normality [ 65 ] ; and brown and forsythe s ( b - f ) test ( i.e. , levene s test with absolute deviations from the median ) for homogeneity of the variances [ 66 ] .",
    "if there is lack of significant deviation from normality of distribution of a metric distances for a group , we will state it as `` the metric distances for the group can be assumed to come from a normally distributed population '' , henceforth .",
    "we compare metric distances at baseline and follow - up .",
    "the lb - cdr0.5 metric distances and lf - cdr0.5 metric distances are dependent as they come from the same person at baseline and follow - up .",
    "likewise for lb - cdr0 and lf - cdr0 pairs .",
    "hence our null hypothesis for the comparison of baseline and follow - up groups is @xmath80 where @xmath81 ) is the mean difference of metric distances between hippocampi at baseline and follow - up for each of cdr0 left , cdr0 right , cdr0.5 left , cdr0.5 right hippocampi .",
    "we also compare the metric distances for the left and right hippocampi are dependent ( for each left - right hippocampi pair comes from the same subject ) .",

    "we also estimate the empirical cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) of the metric distances and compare them by kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , cramr s test , and cramr - von mises test .",
    "the null hypothesis for the comparison of cdfs of the metric distances per diagnosis groups , cdr0 and cdr0.5 , is @xmath86 for each baseline left , baseline right , follow - up left , follow - up right hippocampi . for calculation of the critical value of cramr s",
    "test the kernel @xmath87 ( which is recommended for location alternatives ) is used .",
    "the estimated @xmath88-values are based on @xmath89 and 10000 ordinary bootstrap replicates .",
    "we apply logistic discrimination with metric distances and other variables , since the diagnosis have only two levels , namely cdr0 and cdr0.5 .",
    "we use logistic regression to estimate or predict the risk or probability of having dat using metric distances , together with side ( i.e. , hemisphere ) and timepoint ( baseline vs follow - up ) factors . in other words",
    ", we model the probability that the subject is cdr0.5 given the metric distance of the subject for left or right hippocampus at baseline or follow - up . in standard logistic regression",
    "the model - parameters are obtained via maximum likelihood estimators . for more on logistic regression and logistic discrimination , see [ 69 ] and [ 70 ] , respectively .",
    "we consider the logistic model with the response where ( i.e. , the probability that the subject is diagnosed with cdr0.5 ) .",
    "first we model with one predictor variable at a time from side , timepoint , and metric distance , etc .",

    "we choose a reduced model by aic in a stepwise algorithm , and then use stepwise backward elimination procedure on the resulting model [ 64 ] .",
    "we stop the elimination procedure when all the remaining variables are significant at @xmath89 level .",
    "based on the final model with significant predictors , we apply logistic discrimination . in logistic discrimination",
    "the log - odds - ratio of the conditional classification and therefore indirectly the conditional probabilities of being cdr0.5 and cdr0 are modeled . in general ,",
    "if this estimated probability is larger than a prespecified probability @xmath92 , the subject is classified as cdr0.5 , otherwise the subject is classified as cdr0 ( i.e. , normal ) .",
    "this means our decision function reduces to @xmath93 where @xmath92 is usually taken to be 0.5 .",
    "this threshold probability @xmath92 can also be optimized with respect to a cost function which incorporates correct classification rates , sensitivity , and/or specificity [ 71 ] .",
    "we apply the same analysis procedure on hippocampal volumes to compare the results with lddmm metric distances .",
    "furthermore , we find the differential volume loss and metric distance change by using the annual percentage rate of change ( apc ) in volume and metric distance ( see [ 71 ] for apc in volume for entorhinal cortex ) .",
    "we also consider the logistic discrimination models that incorporate volume and metric distance together and apc in volumes and metric distances together .",
    "the summary measures for the variables are provided in table [ tab : summary - stat - dist ] .",
    "observe that the subjects are evenly distributed in terms of gender , years of education , scan intervals , and age for the diagnostic groups .",
    "the brain and intracranial volumes are much larger in scale , then come the hippocampal volumes , and then the metric distances .",
    "notice that brain and hippocampal volumes all decrease by time and are smaller in cdr0.5 subjects compared to cdr0 subjects . on the other hand , the metric distances tend to increase by time and are larger for the cdr0.5 subjects .",
    "also presented in table [ tab : summary - stat - dist ] are the @xmath88-values for lilliefor s test of normality and wilcoxon rank sum test for differences between the diagnostic groups .",
    "notice that most variables can be assumed to follow a gaussian distribution , but since a few fails to do so , we apply the wilcoxon rank sum test instead of welch s @xmath79-test .",
    "the diagnostic groups do not significantly differ in age , education , brain and intracranial volumes .",
    "furthermore , among the metric distances , we see that only right follow - up metric distances are significantly different between the diagnostic groups .",
    "we present the pairs plot ( scatter plot of each pair ) of continuous variables in figure [ fig : pairs - plot ] and also calculate the correlation coefficients between each pair of the variables ( not presented ) .",
    "we observe that age and education are not significantly correlated with any of the other variables .",
    "hence we discard them in our prospective analysis ( except for logistic discrimination ) .",
    "we observe significant correlation between each pair of hippocampal volumes , and between each pair of brain and intracranial volumes .",
    "the metric distances are only moderately correlated with each other .",
    "hippocampal volumes are mildly correlated with brain and intracranial volumes .",
    "the same holds for the metric distances but to a lesser extent .",
    "summary statistics of population mean , standard deviation ( sd ) , minimum , first quartile ( @xmath69 ) , median , third quartile ( @xmath70 ) , and maximum for @xmath71 are presented in table [ tab : summary - stat - dist ] .",
    "baseline metric distances seem to be different in distribution ( location and spread ) from follow - up metric distances follow - up distances being larger than baseline distances for both left and right hippocampi ; likewise left metric distances seem to be different from right metric distances with right distances being larger than left for both baseline and follow - up .",
    "let ldb be the metric distances for left hippocampi at baseline , ldf be the metric distances for left hippocampi at follow - up .",
    "let rdb and rdf be similarly defined for right hippocampi .",
    "one - tailed @xmath79-tests revealed that the order of these measures is ldb @xmath94 ldf @xmath94 rdb @xmath94 rdf with all inequalities being significant at .05 level .",
    "this implies that the morphometric differences of left hippocampi with respect to the left hippocampus of the template subject at baseline are significantly smaller than those at follow - up , i.e. , at baseline , left hippocampi are more similar to the left template hippocampus , and by follow - up left hippocampi tend to become more different in morphometry ( shape and size ) from the template hippocampus .",
    "this is not surprising , as the template hippocampus is one from the baseline hippocampi .",
    "that is the template was based on a baseline scan .",
    "although this should seem to be irrelevant in view of the wide age variation , it is not the age that is the main point here , when baseline and follow - up are compared , we use matched pair ( i.e. , dependent ) tests , which would reveal differences that would otherwise be concealed by the independent two - sample tests .",
    "for example , when all the subjects age about two years , their morphometric alterations accumulate to render their relative difference from the template more significant .    the right hippocampi reveal similar morphometric differences and change over time .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the morphometric difference of right hippocampi from the right template hippocampus is significantly larger compared to the morphometric difference of left hippocampi from the left template at both baseline and follow - up . the summary statistics ( means and standard deviations ( sd ) ) for left and right metric distances by group are provided in table [ tab : summary - stat - dist ] .    observe that cdr0 distances are smaller than cdr0.5 distances at baseline and at follow - up for both left and right hippocampi .",
    "this suggests that the morphometric differences of cdr0 hippocampi with respect to the template hippocampus are smaller than those of cdr0.5 hippocampi .",
    "this is not surprising , considering the template hippocampus being one of the cdr0 hippocampi .",
    "furthermore , the standard deviations of the distances for cdr0 subjects tend to be smaller than those of cdr0.5 subjects .",
    "that is , the morphometric variability of cdr0 hippocampi with respect to the template hippocampus is smaller than that of cdr0.5 hippocampi .",
    "the statistical significance of these results will be provided in the following sections .",
    "see also figure [ fig : scatter - plot - metric - dist ] for the ( jittered ) scatter plots of the metric distances by group , where the crosses are centered at the mean distances and the points are jittered ( scattered ) along the horizontal axis in order to avoid frequent point concurrence and tight clustering of points , thereby making the plot better for visualization .",
    "the volumes and metric distances measure different but related aspects of morphometry , so some of the variables are highly correlated with each other ( see figure [ fig : pairs - plot ] ) .",
    "we perform principal component analysis ( pca ) to obtain a set of uncorrelated variables that hopefully represent some identifiable aspect of the morphometry .",
    "see [ 70,76 ] for more on pca .",
    "when we perform pca of metric distances and volumes of left hippocampi at baseline with eigenvalues based on the covariance matrix , we observe that the first principal component ( pc ) accounts for almost all the variation ( see table [ tab : pca - left - covariance ] ) .",
    "considering the variable loadings in table [ tab : pca - left - covariance ] , we see that pc1 is the head size component , pc2 is the contrast between brain and intracranial volumes , pc3 is the hippocampus size , and pc4 is the metric distance component . however , the volumes are in @xmath95 and metric distances are unitless , hence the data are not to scale .",
    "in particular , the brain and intracranial volumes have the largest variation in the data set , hence dominate the pcs . to remove the influence of the scale ( or unit ) ,",
    "we apply pca with eigenvalues based on the correlation matrix ( i.e. , pca on the standardized variables ) .",
    "the importance scores of principal components and variable loadings from the pca of metric distances and volumes of left hippocampi at baseline and followup with eigenvalues based on the correlation matrix are presented in table 3 .",
    "notice that with the correlation matrix , the first three pcs account for almost all the variation in the variables . comparing the variable loadings",
    ", pc1 seems to be the head size component , pc2 is the hippocampus shape , pc3 is the hippocampus size and the contrast between hippocampus and head size , and pc4 is the contrast between brain and intracranial volume .",
    "the pca on variables for right hippocampi yields similar results ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the variable loadings in the pca of variables at baseline and follow - up suggest that brain and intracranial volumes are mostly measures of head size , metric distance is mostly a measure of hippocampus shape and partly is a measure of head and hippocampus size , and hippocampus volume is mostly a measure of hippocampus size and partly related to hippocampus shape and head size .",
    "that is , volumes and the metric distance convey information that is related but not identical .",
    "volumes mostly emphasize the size differences , while metric distances emphasize the shape differences . hence",
    ", one should use both of them in morphometric analysis of brain tissues .      due to within - subject dependence of metric distances for left and right hemispheres and for baseline and follow - up measures , we apply repeated - measures analysis with group and side as main effects and timepoint as the repeated factor , and group as main effect and side - by - timepoint as the repeated factor ( see below ) .",
    "for the left data , metric distances at baseline for cdr0.5 subjects are labeled as lb - cdr0.5 , at follow - up are labeled as lf - cdr0.5 .",
    "cdr0 individuals are labeled as lb - cdr0 and lf - cdr0 accordingly .",
    "similar labeling is done for the right metric distances .",

    "the subjects in this paper have been previously analyzed using related but different tools . as a single scalar measure",
    ", volumes were used for diagnosis group comparisons at baseline and follow - up [ 29 ] and displacement momentum vector fields based on lddmm were used for discrimination [ 57 ] .",
    "but the metric distances computed from lddmm has not hitherto been used in diagnosis group analysis .",
    "the metric distance gives a single number reflecting the global morphometry ( i.e. , the size and shape ) while volume measurements only provide information on size .",
    "so metric distances provide morphometric information not conveyed by volume whereas momentum vector fields also provide local information on shape changes .",
    "further , the morphometric information conveyed by the metric distance depends on the choice of the template , while the morphometric information conveyed by momentum vector fields is independent of the template chosen .",
    "that is , although the vector fields change when the template changes , the morphometric information they convey is the same .",
    "previously , it has been shown that hippocampal volume loss and shape deformities observed in subjects with dat distinguished them from both elderly and younger control subjects [ 10 ] .",
    "the pattern of hippocampal deformities in subjects with dat was largely symmetric and suggested damage to the ca1 hippocampal subfield [ 74 ] .",
    "hippocampal shape changes were also observed in healthy elderly subjects , which distinguished them from healthy younger subjects .",
    "these shape changes occurred in a pattern distinct from the pattern seen in dat and were not associated with substantial volume loss [ 75 ]",
    ".    furthermore , wang et al . [ 45 ] analyzed the baseline hippocampi of the same data set and showed that the very mild dat subjects showed significant inward variation in the left and right lateral zones ( lz ) the left and right intermediate zone ( imz ) , but not in the left and right superior zones ( sz ) as compared to cdr0 subjects . in their logistic regression analysis ,",
    "inward variation of the left and right lz or imz by 0.1 mm relative to the average of the nondemented subjects increased the odds of the subject being a very mild dat subject rather than being a nondemented subject .",
    "the odds ratios for the left and right sz were not significant .",
    "these results represented a replication of their previous findings [ 10 ] and suggest that inward deformities of the hippocampal surface in proximity to the ca1 subfield and subiculum can be used to distinguish subjects with very mild dat from cdr0 subjects [ 45 ] .",
    "however , although momentum vector fields obtained by the lddmm algorithm can be used to detect such local ( i.e. , location specific ) morphometric changes ( as in the ca1 subfield ) , metric distance does not provide such local information , hence fails to indicate any type of laterality differences .",
    "the main results in this paper are that although metric distances did not detect any significant difference in morphometry at baseline ( see table [ tab : comparison - lddmm - distance ] ) , follow - up metric distances for the right hippocampus in cdr0.5 ( i.e. , mildly demented ) subjects are found to be significantly larger than those in cdr0 ( i.e. , non - demented ) subjects ( see table [ tab : comparison - lddmm - distance ] ) .",
    "wang et al . also analyzed the velocity vector fields for the baseline hippocampi of the same data set and found that the left hippocampus in the dat group shows significant shape abnormality and the right hippocampus shows similar pattern of abnormality [ 57 ] .",
    "again , the reason for the metric failing to detect such abnormality in the baseline hippocampi is that metric distance is a compound and oversummarizing measure of global morphometry . from baseline to follow - up",
    ", metric distances for cdr0.5 subjects significantly increase while those in cdr0 subjects do not ( see table [ tab : comparison - lddmm - distance ] ) .",
    "that is , the morphometry ( shape and size ) of hippocampus in cdr0.5 subjects changes significantly over time , but not in cdr0 subjects .",
    "atrophy  over two years  might occur with aging , and this is captured by metric distances ( see table [ tab : comparison - lddmm - distance ] ) .",
    "however the increase in the metric distances in cdr0 subjects is not found to be statistically significant .",
    "such differences in morphometry between diagnosis groups or morphometric changes over time can be detected by metric distances computed via lddmm and could potentially serve as a biomarker for the disease .",
    "previously , the volumes and velocity vector fields associated with the same data set ( i.e. , baseline and follow - up of both groups ) were also analyzed and it was found that hippocampal volume loss over time was significantly greater in the cdr0.5 subjects ( left = 8.3% , right = 10.2% ) than in the cdr0 subjects ( left = 4.0% , right = 5.5% ) ( anova , @xmath330 = 7.81 , @xmath88 = 0.0078 ) . using singular - value decomposition and",
    "logistic regression models , [ 45 ] quantified hippocampal shape change across time within individuals , and this shape change in the cdr0.5 and cdr0 subjects was found to be significantly different ( wilks @xmath331 , p = 0.014 ) .",
    "further , at baseline , cdr0.5 subjects , in comparison to cdr0 subjects , showed inward deformation over 38% of the hippocampal surface ; after 2 years this difference grew to 47% .",
    "also , within the cdr0 subjects , shape change between baseline and follow - up was largely confined to the head of the hippocampus and subiculum , while in the cdr0.5 subjects , shape change involved the lateral body of the hippocampus as well as the head region and subiculum .",
    "these results suggest that different patterns of hippocampal shape change in time as well as different rates of hippocampal volume loss distinguish very mild dat from healthy aging [ 29 ] .    in regard to statistical analysis , as a compound but brief measure of morphometry , metric distances can thus serve as a first step to identify the morphometric differences , and can be used as a pointer to which direction a clinician or data analyst could go .",
    "the importance of the cdr0 versus cdr0.5 contrast analyzed here is that it tests a necessary but not sufficient condition for the eventual goal of discriminating cdr0s who subsequently convert to cdr0.5 , from cdr0s who subsequently stay cdr0 .",
    "as subjects are followed longitudinally and some convert , we have shown that cross - sectional measures of the hippocampal structure can be used to predict those who convert .",
    "metric distances may also be used in this way .",
    "when baseline and followup of converted and nonconverted nondemented subjects were analyzed , it was found that the inward variation of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted conversion to cdr0.5 in separate cox proportional hazards models . when hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a single model , inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal surface",
    "was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion .",
    "the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented subjects who later converted to cdr0.5 was similar to the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate subjects with very mild dat and nondemented subjects .",
    "these results suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in a zone corresponding to the ca1 subfield is an early predictor of the onset of dat in nondemented elderly subjects [ 74 ] .",
    "this appears to contradict our finding that the morphometric changes in cdr0.5 right hippocampi from baseline to follow - up is significantly larger than those of cdr0.5 left hippocampi ( @xmath332 ) .",
    "the morphometric changes in cdr0 right hippocampi from baseline to follow - up are not significantly different from those of cdr0 left hippocampi ( @xmath333 ) .",
    "the morphometric changes in cdr0.5 left hippocampi from baseline to follow - up are not significantly different from those in cdr0 left hippocampi ( @xmath334 ) , while the morphometric changes in cdr0.5 right hippocampi from baseline to follow - up are significantly larger than those of cdr0 right hippocampi ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "therefore , over time , dat may alter the ( global ) morphometry of the right hippocampus . however , note that the finding in [ 74 ] are concerned with changes in ( local ) subregions of hippocampi , while metric distance is concerned with overall morphometric changes",
    ". that is , dat might implicate ca1 of the left hippocampi , yet the overall change in morphometry of right hippocampi might be more substantial .",
    "moreover , in [ 74 ] the converted ( from cdr0 to cdr0.5 ) subjects were analyzed separately , which we do not consider such conversion in our analysis . also , metric distance results agree with the volume comparisons of [ 29 ] , hence volume ( i.e. , scale ) might be highly dominating the morphometric changes in the hippocampi . in other words ,",
    "the significant volume reduction in left and right hippocampi might dominate the change in shape , when morphometry is measured by metric distances . to remove the size influence",
    "so as to measure the shapes only , one can perform scaling on the hippocampi and then apply lddmm to normalize the size differences .",
    "differences and changes ( over time ) in morphometry can also be used for diagnostic discrimination of subjects in non - demented or demented groups .",
    "many discrimination techniques such as fisher s linear discriminant functions , support vector machines , and logistic discrimination can be applied to the metric distances , together with other qualitative variables . in this study we applied logistic discrimination based on metric distances , as logistic regression not only provides a means for classification , but also yields a probability estimate for having dat .",
    "furthermore , one can optimize the threshold probability for a particular cost function for the entire training data set , or by a cross - validation technique .",
    "the correct classification rate of the hippocampi was about 70% in our logistic regression analysis .",
    "in [ 57 ] pca of the initial momentum of the same data set led to correct classification of 12 out of 18 ( i.e. , 67% of the ) demented subjects and 22 out of 26 ( i.e. , 85% of the ) control subjects .",
    "metric distances can be used to distinguish ad from normal aging quantitatively ; however , to be able to use it for diagnostic purposes , the method should be improved to a greater extent .",
    "we perform a principal component analysis on metric distances and hippocampus , brain , and intracranial volumes . considering the variable loadings ,",
    "we conclude that volumes are mostly measures of size and partly related to shape , while the metric distance is mostly a measure of shape and partly related to size .",
    "we also compare the cross - sectional , longitudinal , and discrimination results of lddmm distances with those of volumes .",
    "we observe that cross - sectional and longitudinal analysis give similar results , although metric distances increase and volumes decrease by time .",
    "the metric distance , being an extremely condensed summary measure give very similar results as the hippocampal volume .",
    "that is , neither volume nor metric distance discriminated left baseline ( lb ) , right baseline ( rb ) , or left followup ( lf ) between cdr0 and cdr0.5 ; volume reduction and metric distances differences are both significant for cdr0.5 subjects , but neither of them are significant for cdr0 subjects ; and anova suggested a significant diagnosis group - by - timepoint interaction for both measures . on the other hand ,",
    "we obtain better classification results with using volumes compared to metric distances .",
    "when volume and lddmm distances are used together , the classification results improve compared to results based on volume or distance only .",
    "furthermore , the differential volume and distance changes are measured by annual percentage rate of change ( apc ) for the two year period in the study .",
    "similar to the results of [ 71 ] , we found that apc in volumes may be a good indicator for early stage of dat .",
    "however , apc in lddmm distances do not provide a good performance in classification of cdr0 versus ccdr0.5 hippocampi . comparing the discrimination results",
    ", we found that the classifier based on volume , distance , and apc in volume has the best performance .",
    "hence these measures may constitute a reliable biomarker when used together .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented detailed statistical analysis of metric distances computed with lddmm and show that this is potentially a powerful tool in detecting morphometric changes between diagnosis groups or changes in morphometry over time .",
    "furthermore , we avoid the single subject analysis , which might be of greater interest clinically .",
    "metric distances depend on the choice of template anatomy used .",
    "however , in this article we do not address the issue of template selection for optimal differentiation between hippocampus morphometry .",

    "<S> in this article , we analyze the morphometry ( shape and size ) of hippocampus in subjects with very mild dementia of alzheimer s type ( dat ) and nondemented controls and how the morphometry changes over a two - year period . </S>",
    "<S> morphometric differences with respect to a template hippocampus were measured by the metric distance obtained from the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping ( lddmm ) algorithm which was previously used to calculate dense one - to - one correspondence vector fields between the shapes . </S>",
    "<S> lddmm assigns metric distances on the space of anatomical images thereby allowing for the direct comparison and quantization of morphometric changes . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize what additional information the metric distances provide in terms of size and shape given the volume measurements of the hippocampi . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate how metric distances can be used in cross - sectional , longitudinal , and left - right asymmetry comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a principal component analysis on metric distances and hippocampus , brain , and intracranial volumes . </S>",
    "<S> we use repeated measures anova models to test the main effects of and interaction between the diagnosis , duration , and hemisphere factors to see which factors significantly explain the differences in metric distances . </S>",
    "<S> when a factor is found to be significant , we use classical parametric and non - parametric tests to compare the metric distances for that factor . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of metric distances is then used to compare the effects of aging in the hippocampus . at baseline , </S>",
    "<S> the metric distances for demented subjects are found not to be significantly different from those for nondemented subjects . at follow - up , </S>",
    "<S> the metric distances for demented subjects were significantly larger compared to nondemented subjects . </S>",
    "<S> the metric distances for demented subjects increased significantly from baseline to follow - up but not for nondemented subjects . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that metric distances can be used in a logistic regression model for diagnostic discrimination of subjects . </S>",
    "<S> we compare metric distances with the volumes and obtain similar results in cross - sectional and longitudinal comparisons . in classification , the model that uses volume , metric distance , and volume loss over time together performs better in detecting dat . </S>",
    "<S> thus , metric distances with respect to a template computed via lddmm can be a powerful tool in detecting differences in shape in cross - sectional as well as longitudinal studies .    </S>",
