    "the success of galaxy formation models is usually measured by their ability to match key observational properties of the galaxy distribution . however , only a small fraction ( @xmath1 , cole et al .",
    "2001 ; lin et al .  2003 ; balogh et al .  2001 ; 2008 ) of the baryons in the universe end up as luminous stars .",
    "the vast majority of baryons remain in diffuse form , either because they are unable to condense out of the intergalactic medium ( for example , because their host dark matter halos are too small to resist heating from the diffuse inter - galactic background radiation ; see , e.g. , gnedin 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ) or because they are ejected from the star forming regions of galaxies by strong feedback ( white & frenk 1991 ; benson et al .",
    "2003 [ be03 ] ) . in general , it is difficult to observe the intergalactic medium directly : because of its low temperature , its properties must be inferred from metal line studies ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "2005 ) ; however , within groups and clusters of galaxies the intergalactic medium becomes sufficiently hot ( and dense ) that it can be observed at x - ray wavelengths ( cavaliere et al .",
    "this x - ray emitting plasma is usually referred to as the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "there is a long history of work attempting to explain the observed properties of the icm ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; voit et al .",
    "2003 ; bode et al .  2007",
    "; mccarthy et al .",
    "generally , it has been concluded that the observed properties can not be explained by the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes alone : the energetics of observed clusters and the scaling of the x - ray emission with system temperature suggest that an additional heat source is required .",
    "for example , gravitational collapse predicts that the x - ray luminosity of clusters should scale with temperature as roughly @xmath2 ( for @xmath3 more than a few kev ) , while the observed relation is much steeper , scaling as @xmath4 ( e.g. , edge & stewart 1991 ; markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "the steepening of the relation can be explained by heating the icm so that its central density is lower in lower temperature systems .",
    "this is most efficiently achieved by heating the icm prior to its collapse so that a high minimum adiabat is set , resisting the gravitational compression of the system .",
    "such preheating models have been explored extensively in the literature ( e.g. kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; borgani et al .  2002",
    "; mccarthy et al .  2002 ; muanwong et al .  2002 ) .",
    "indeed the authors of the present paper have been strong proponents of the energetic efficiency of the preheating model . however , the source of the preheating energy is rarely explicitly modelled .",
    "it is often hypothesised to be associated with galaxy formation , or the growth of supermassive black holes , but there is an inherent tension in these models .",
    "the scaling of system entropy with mass ( @xmath5 ) of the gas rather than the thermodynamically correct logarithmic quantity . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the characteristic temperature and gas density of the system . ] ) makes it difficult to simultaneously preheat the igm to a sufficiently high adiabat that it is able explain the properties of galaxy clusters and yet retain sufficient low entropy gas in lower mass halo to obtain a realistic galaxy population .",
    "this is a generic problem  few models attempt to explain the properties of the icm while simultaneously accounting for the observed properties of galaxies ( for two exceptions see wu et al .",
    "2000 and scannapieco et al .",
    "for example , while bower et al .",
    "( 2001 ) explored the effect of heating during galaxy formation on the properties of the icm , these models did not take into account the back reaction of this heating on the formation of galaxies .",
    "we briefly explored the a self - consistent model in be03 , but found that it was not capable of reproducing the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "it is , nevertheless , possible that a successful pre - heating model may eventually emerge .",
    "two possible strategies include ( 1 ) cooling a large fraction of the baryons prior to the pre - heating epoch and then slowing the consumption of this material to prolong star formation to the present epoch , or ( 2 ) linking the preheating level ( at @xmath8 ) to the mass of the present - day halo .",
    "the first scheme is at odds with the strong feedback required in many current galaxy formation models since gas is rapidly re - cycled between the cold disk and the halo",
    ". the second scheme might be effective if entropy excesses are strongly amplified during halo mergers ( e.g. , borgani et al .  2005 ) .",
    "however , such a scheme is currently too ill - defined to be implemented in to the semi - analytic models . while we are currently undertaking a series of numerical experiments to better define the effect of halo mergers on the entropy distribution of the gas they contain ( mccarthy et al .  2007 ; mccarthy et al .  in prep",
    ") , the results are currently difficult to interpret , in part because of the lack of consistency between sph and mesh - code simulations of galaxy clusters ( voit , kay & bryan 2005 ; mitchel et al .",
    "it is also important to stress that the energetic efficiency of the pre - heating model is only realised if the heating occurs before the gas is incorporated into virialised haloes .",
    "this makes the process intrinsically hard to model in the current semi - analytic framework .    in view of the above difficulties , it is useful to take a step back from the problem .",
    "if the properties of galaxies and the low observed stellar mass fraction are set aside , cooling provides an appealing explanation for the observed scalings of the icm ( voit & bryan 2001 ; muanwong et al .",
    "2001 ) . because the cooling time is closely related to the adiabat ( or entropy ) of the gas , lower mass systems ( with lower characteristic entropy ) tend to cool out a larger fraction of their icm .",
    "this is sufficient to reproduce many of the observed trends in x - ray properties , but the implied stellar fractions are much larger than those observed ( for a recent discussion see balogh et al .",
    "this suggests that a simpler alternative to the pre - heating model is worth further investigation : we need to arrange for feedback to eject much of the cooling gas from the system before , rather than after , allowing it to form stars . in this paper , we explore such a model , introducing a self - consistent ` radio - mode ' gas ejection scheme into the bower et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter b06 ) galaxy formation model .",
    "we propagate the ejected gas fractions through the merger hierarchy so that the scheme has elements in common with the preheating scenario discussed above .",
    "however , since gas is ejected in virialised haloes by ` in - situ ' heating , it has none of the energetic efficiency of the pre - heating scenario and the required energy injection will inevitably be large .",
    "the over - cooling problem is closely related to the problems of shaping the galaxy luminosity function and explaining galaxy `` down - sizing '' and the absence of bright blue galaxies at the centres of clusters . in b06",
    "we showed that these problems could be resolved by including a strong `` radio mode '' of agn feedback in the models ( see also croton et al .",
    "2006 : we use the term `` radio - mode '' to distinguish recurrent , largely mechanical agn feedback resulting from accretion in hydrostatic haloes , from the more radiatively efficient `` quasar - mode '' of agn activity which we associate with galaxy mergers and disk instabilities ) . at late times",
    "( low redshifts ) , massive haloes host galaxies with large black holes so that even a small amount of gas cooling out of the icm and being accreted onto the black hole results in sufficient energy feedback to offset the cooling . in b06",
    "we assumed that this set up a self - regulating feedback loop that prevented any significant amount of gas cooling . adding the additional requirement that the feedback loop is only effective in hydrostatic haloes ( where the sound crossing time is shorter than the cooling time at the cooling radius ) creates a natural scale at which the efficiency of galaxy formation falls .",
    "this results in a good match to the luminosity function and other observational constraints on the formation and evolution of galaxies ( see birnboim & dekel 2003 and keres et al .",
    "2005 for further discussion of importance of distinguishing  hydrostatic and `` rapid cooling '' haloes ) .    in this paper",
    "we take the process a step further .",
    "we consider the possibility that sufficiently massive black holes not only prevent cooling in their host haloes , but may also inject sufficient energy to expel gas from the halo .",
    "as gas is expelled , the central density drops , the cooling time becomes longer and the cooling rate , and hence energy feedback , become smaller .",
    "the system will move to a new lower density configuration where the energy feedback just balances the cooling rate .",
    "the concept is appealing since the final configuration is set by the cooling time in the halo , while the ejection of gas avoids the excess production of stars .",
    "it combines the simplicity of the scheme suggested by voit & bryan ( 2001 ) while offering the potential to give a good match to observed galaxy properties .",
    "the model allows us to propagate the effects of heating at early epochs to later times , but it does not implement `` preheating '' in the way envisaged by many previous papers . as a result ,",
    "the energy requirements of the model we present are larger than in preheating schemes . since observational estimates of the pv work required to inflate x - ray cavities suggest that jet powers are only comparable to cluster cooling luminosities ( above 3  kev ) this is a significant draw - back ( e.g. , birzan et al .",
    "2004 ; 2008 ; dunn & fabian 2006 ; best et al . 2007 ) unless these estimates severely underestimate that total jet heating power .",
    "the model will also struggle to match the details of the internal properties of clusters  see the discussion of the entropy profiles of clusters at intermediate radius in mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , for example .",
    "nevertheless , an order of magnitude calculation shows that the model is worth further consideration .",
    "examining the properties of clusters in the b06 model , we find that the _ total _ mass of all the black holes in a cluster of mass @xmath9 is typically @xmath10 . in order to estimate the maximum energy contribution from black hole growth",
    ", we assume the radio - mode dominates the growth of these large black holes , and the kinetic power of the jet is @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the mass growth rate of the black hole ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "the total heating energy is @xmath13 , while the potential energy of the baryons is @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the baryon mass fraction and @xmath16 is the virial radius of the system ) .",
    "since these numbers are comparable , it suggests that black hole heating could eject a substantial fraction of the hot gas from the system . at lower halo masses ,",
    "the black hole heating would completely dominate the thermal energy of the baryons ; while , at higher halo masses , the black hole heating becomes a minor perturbation .",
    "thus , under these assumptions , the effect of this heating is to establish a new scale of @xmath17 on which haloes are able to retain their hot x - ray emitting plasma . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we explore this idea in detail , adding flesh to the order of magnitude calculation outlined above .",
    "in particular , we take full account of the different channels for black hole mass growth ( we assume that black hole growth occurs through the qso mode does not provide heat the icm efficiently ) and for the effect of heating in subhaloes that are subsequently accreted by the growing cluster .",
    "the methods we adopt here are semi - analytic and based on the techniques described in detail in cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see the recent review by baugh 2006 ) .",
    "we are able to implement feedback on a macroscopic scale without attempting to resolve the detailed physical processes that heat and eject the icm .",
    "much simulation work is being devoted to studying the formation of jets and their interaction with the surrounding icm ( quilis et al .",
    "2001 ; churazov et al .",
    "2001 ; dalla vecchia et al .  2004 ; heinz et al .  2006 ; sijacki & springel 2006 ) . ultimately , these mechanisms need to be incorporated into cosmological scale simulations of galaxy formation and the icm ( sijacki et al .  2007 ; okamoto et al .",
    "unfortunately , the myriad of important physical processes make this direct approach extremely difficult and computationally expensive . semi - analytic methods , such as those adopted in the present study , allow a wide range of possible physical processes to be explored with a greatly reduced computational effort .",
    "ultimately , however , the details of the processes we model will need to be justified by high resolution numerical simulations and observations .",
    "the approach we present here is intended to capture the broad - brush energetics and integrated properties of clusters .",
    "we assume that the heating effect of the agn can be captured by a single number that measures the non - gravitational heat input into the system and we adopt a particular form the modification of the system s density profile . in reality",
    "the situation is likely considerably more complex : for example , the radial dependence of the heat input may vary between systems ( e.g. , heinz et al .",
    "2006 have argued that halo mergers play a vital role in mixing the heat input from jets into icm ) , or the energy in an infalling subsystem might be distributed in different ways depending on the shocks generated as it falls into the main halo ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) . as a result of these processes",
    ", systems may have different density profiles even though the total energy input is the same and we can not expect to recover the detailed radial structure of clusters .",
    "however , despite this simplification , we will see that the model already captures the global features of observational data well , including the scatter in the x - ray luminosity  temperature ( hereafter l ",
    "t ) correlation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2 , we describe how we implement the `` radio mode '' heating of the icm .",
    "this section includes a discussion of the parameter values that are modified from those in b06 .",
    "we present results from the model in  3 , initially focusing on the x - ray luminosity  temperature ( l  t ) correlation , and then moving to gas mass fractions and galaxy properties .",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss how the model can be developed in  4 . through out",
    "we use units of @xmath18 for masses . for comparison with x - ray observations ,",
    "however , the choice of h@xmath19 does not scale out of the relations , and we adopt @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the model assumes @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper we introduce a relatively simple modification to the b06 model in order to take into account the heating effect of the agn .",
    "the basis of the method is to compute the feedback energy from the agn as a function of the cooling rate . in hydrostatic haloes ,",
    "the feedback energy is used to redistribute or eject the gas from the halo , thus reducing the system s central density .",
    "we make this modification by reducing the density normalisation while keeping the shape of the profile unchanged .",
    "the results are not strongly dependent on the details of where the `` ejected '' gas is placed so long as it is removed from the x - ray luminous central regions of the cluster . because there is only one parameter determining the modification ( specifically , the ratio of cumulative energy injected by the agn to the thermal energy of the halo  see below ) we can track the change in the profile by accumulating the additional energy that is input into the profile ( wu et al .",
    "2000 ; bower et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in subsequent time steps",
    ", a new cooling rate and feedback energy is calculated .",
    "if the feedback energy still exceeds the radiated energy , the gas distribution is further adjusted .",
    "this process continues until the system reaches a stable configuration where the cooling rate is balanced by the heating rate .",
    "we compute the heating power ( @xmath25 ) available from the agn as the smaller of @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the eddington luminosity of the black hole and @xmath29 is the cooling rate of the halo ( in the absence of radio - mode feedback ) . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parameters controlling the disk structure and the efficiency with which cooling material can be accreted by the black hole .",
    "the first condition corresponds to the eddington luminosity criterion used in b06 . at first sight",
    ", it might seem that the eddington luminosity is not a relevant criterion for radio - mode feedback .",
    "however , we emphasise that the limit we impose relates to the accretion disk structure , rather than the maximum feedback energy itself .",
    "efficient jet production is thought to be associated with a geometrically thick , advection dominated disks ( e.g. , rees et al .  1982 ; meier 2001 ; churazov et al .",
    "2005 ) . if the accretion rate is too high , current models suggest that the vertical height of the disk will collapse with a corresponding drop in jet efficiency .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that this structural change occurs at @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the accretion rate on to the black hole , @xmath34 is the eddington accretion rate and @xmath35 is the disk viscosity parameter ) .",
    "we adopt an disk structure parameter of @xmath36 .. thus , while the paper quotes the efficiency parameter @xmath30 as 0.5 , this should have been @xmath37 . with this correction",
    "the rest of the parameters and results are unchanged .",
    "] this is in broad agreement with plausible accretion disk viscosities ( e.g. , mckinney & gammie 2004 ; hirose et al .",
    "2004 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ) .",
    "if the accretion rate becomes higher , the efficiency actually drops , as the accretion disk becomes thinner and its magnetic field threads the plunging region around the black hole less effectively . in this case , much more of the accretion disk energy is radiated and is not available for `` radio mode '' feedback .",
    "the second criterion corresponds to the accretion power released when the cooling gas reaches the black hole .",
    "we assume that a maximum fraction , @xmath31 , of the cooling gas is available to power feedback from the black hole .",
    "this approach differs from b06 in that it is not only the eddington luminosity of the black hole that limits the available feedback but also the amount of material cooling out of the halo .",
    "before significant material has been ejected from the halo , the first criterion usually limits the energy output .",
    "we adopt an efficiency of @xmath38 ( i.e. , only 1% of @xmath29 reaches the black hole ) and assume that this mass accretion results in a jet power output of @xmath39 ( i.e. , 10% of the mass accretion rate ) .",
    "the latter is easily compatible with the efficiency of jets expected from advection dominated accretion disks around spinning black holes ( e.g. , meier 1999 ; 2001 ; nemmen et al .",
    "allen et al .  (",
    "2006 ) compare the jet power ( measured from the cavity pdv work ) with the bondi accretion power of several nearby x - ray luminous ellitpical galaxies .",
    "they find that the jet power is 2% of the rest mass energy accretion rate at the bondi radius .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath40 if we equate the bondi accretion rate with 5% of @xmath29 . in practise , however , it is more relevant to compare the heating power with the system s cooling luminosity .",
    "we find that our systems have a bimodal distribution of energy injection rates , with many of the systems in a passive phase . amongst the active systems , however , we find that the injected power typically exceeds the total cooling rate by a factor 10100 .",
    "thus the model significantly exceeds the energy rates estimated on the basis of cavity pdv work ( e.g. , fabian et al 2003 ; birzan et al 2004 ; dunn et al 2005 ) .",
    "as nusser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and best et al .",
    "( 2007 ) emphasise it is likely that this underestimates the true heating rate , but probably not by as large a factor as required by the model .",
    "we return to this point in  4 .",
    "finally , we note that the energy feedback that this model requires from the radio mode implies additional black hole mas growth .",
    "we compute the radio - mode contribution to the mass growth rate of the black hole as @xmath41 .",
    "combining this with the limit on the heating rate implies that @xmath42 .    the heating energy given by the above criteria",
    "is then compared to the cooling luminosity of the system . if the heating energy is greater than the cooling luminosity , the excess energy ejects mass from the x - ray emitting region of the halo .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 is the circular velocity of the halo at the virial radius .",
    "the divisor provides an estimate of the energy required to eject the gas from the x - ray emitting region .",
    "we limit the amount ejected in any one time step to @xmath4550% of the current hot gas mass content in order to ensure the numerical stability of the code .",
    "it is important to note that the gas ejected in a time step greatly exceeds the amount of gas that tries to cool out of the halo . in this",
    "respect our model differs significantly from `` circulation flow '' models ( e.g. , mathews et al .",
    "2003 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) in which gas is heated by the agn as it cools out of the hot phase .    as the agn ejects material , the halo profile is rescaled in density to match the new hot gas mass .",
    "we do not alter the core or slope of the gas density profile .",
    "this is in broad agreement with current observations of groups and clusters and results in important simplifications of the cooling calculations that allow us to maintain a high computational speed for each halo . at the next time step ,",
    "@xmath46 will be reduced .",
    "of course this choice of how to modify the halo profile is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "ideally , we might consider the change in entropy of the heated material and propagate this forward through the hierarchy , re - deriving the modified halo profile from its hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential at each step .",
    "this is not possible with our current code because we can not yet propagate entropy modification through the merger hierarchy ( see mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 for recent progress ) . however , the main impact of the scheme we consider is to alter the core density of the gas , and thus to modify the central cooling time and the x - ray luminosity of the system . an important point to note here is that the global properties of the x - ray emitting plasma are dominated by the gas within the central regions of the halo .",
    "thus , global properties ( such as x - ray luminosity and x - ray emission weighted temperature ) are insensitive to how the gas that is removed from the core is distributed outside the core , and we would expect to obtain similar results whether the heated gas is ejected completely from the system or whether the outer radial profile is modified so that the gas is held at relatively low density in the outer parts of the system .",
    "nevertheless , there is a clear need to address this issue in future models : the radial distribution of system entropy and temperature provide sensitive probes of the gas distribution that will allow us to observationally constrain the manner in which gas is re - distributed or ejected within the cluster ( e.g. , mccarthy et al .",
    "the present model is too simplistic to rise to this challenge .",
    "another point is that because we specify the effect in terms of a change in the density profile , we are not requiring that it is the lowest entropy material that is ejected from the system .",
    "indeed , the ejected material is drawn from a wide range of entropies and the entropy of material at the virial radius rises as the density normalisation is reduced .",
    "one can imagine that there may be more energetically efficient ways in which the x - ray luminosity of the system can be reduced by adding thermal energy to the gas .",
    "however , this uncertainty combines directly with the uncertainty in the efficiency of the black hole accretion .",
    "the strategy we adopt here differs significantly from preheating approaches . in preheating scenarios",
    ", gas is heated to high temperatures ( or , more correctly , entropies ) in low mass haloes preventing it from following the collapse of the dark matter hierarchy . in the present model , the ejected hot gas is gradually recaptured as groups merge to form more massive systems and gravitational potential deepens .",
    "we treat this by allowing a fraction of the `` ejected '' gas to be re - integrated into the hot gas component after the merger .",
    "the ejected gas mass in the new halo is given by @xmath47 which is consistent with energy conservation .",
    "this component of the model is important because it allows massive systems to retain a much larger fraction of baryons in their hot component than in the smaller systems .",
    "this is crucial in matching the observed scalings of x - ray properties .    in our current model , we assume that the gas distribution is a @xmath48-profile ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) with @xmath49 , and that the gas is isothermal .",
    "this maintains compatibility with b06 and results in some key simplifications of the energy calculations that allow us to use look - up tables to evaluate the energy integrals and hence maintain a high computational speed .",
    "the code speed is essential since we will later need to evaluate many possible parameter sets in order to identify the best fitting models .",
    "the details of the treatment of gas cooling are described in cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and be03 , but it is helpful to summarise them here .",
    "a fundamental building block of the code is the idea that a new halo is created when its mass of its main progenitor doubles . at this point",
    ", the density normalisation of the halo is set from the hot gas mass , and this time step is used the reference point for the age of the halo . as the halo ages , we compute the cooling radius as a function of the age of the halo .",
    "the amount of gas considered for cooling in any given time step is computed as the difference between the mass cooled in the previous time step and the mass within the current cooling radius . whether this material successfully cools or not is dependent on the agn feedback that we have described above .",
    "the present code develops the approach in be03 , so that the density normalisation increases in response to hot gas accreted by the system ( both from mergers and from diffuse accretion , see be03 ) and decreases in response to the ejection of material by the agn .",
    "we compute the luminosity of the hot halo using the density normalisation defined above and metallicity - dependent sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) cooling tables using the metal abundances self - consistently calculated by galform .",
    "note that this calculation implicitly assumes that as material cools out of the centre of the halo it is replaced by material from larger radius : in line with galform s lagrangian approach to the cooling calculation , we do not adjust the overall density normalisation as material cools out until the halo has doubled in mass . in practise",
    "these subtleties have only a weak impact on the predicted x - ray luminosity since , by construction , little material cools out in hydrostatic haloes with effective agn .",
    "the @xmath48-model has one adjustable parameter  the gas core radius .",
    "we set the core radius of the gas distribution in order match the luminosity of the highest mass clusters .",
    "in practise , the luminosity of these systems depends little on the energy used to eject gas from the system because the hot gas fraction is always high . the effect of increasing the energy that is injected by the agn is to increase the fraction of hot gas that is `` ejected '' from lower mass groups .",
    "we find that a core radius of 0.025 of the virial radius gives reasonable x - ray luminosities for massive systems ( where we expect the effect of agn heating to be small ) .",
    "this approach is preferable to directly adopting an observed core radius since it reduces our dependence on the exact shape of the radial density profile .",
    "we note that the core radius we adopt is larger than that typically found in radiative cosmological simulations , but is comparable to those found in simulations that do not include cooling ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "1999 ; voit , kay & bryan 2005 ) .",
    "the physical origin of this baseline profile is beyond the scope of the model we present here : although further work is clearly justified to remove this limitation of the current model .",
    "as well as setting the normalisation of the bright end of the l ",
    "t relation , the choice of core radius also plays an important role in determining the amount of gas that must be ejected from the system before the cooling rate drops below the critical threshold for feedback .      by introducing this form of heating into the model ,",
    "we make significant changes to the way in which galaxies form , and we must adapt the model parameters to have any chance of obtaining a model that agrees with the observational data ( both the x - ray and galaxy properties ) .",
    "we start by re - running the millennium simulation models described in b06 using the revised code .",
    "this use halo trees extracted from the millennium simulation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 , lemson et al .",
    "2006 ) to provide the merger history of dark haloes within which we compute the galaxy and icm properties .",
    "the new physics that we have introduced has a significant impact on galaxy propeties . as a result of the agn heat input ,",
    "haloes are more likely to be hydrostatic in the new model , and ( if we make no adjustment to the parameters ) we find that the break in the luminosity is too faint to be compatible with observations .",
    "we therefore search for a revised set of parameters that provides a better description of galaxy formation in the new model .",
    "the final parameter values result in a reasonable match to the observed galaxy luminosity function ( see  3.3 ) . in terms of the x - ray relations , however , the results are insensitive to the choice of most of the parameters described below .",
    ".comparison of parameter values in the b06 and the new model presented in this paper .",
    "the effect of the parameter changes is described in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the revised parameter values are listed in table  [ tab : param_table ] .",
    "the values used in b06 are given for comparison .",
    "it is worth briefly outlining the rationale for the changes that we have made .",
    "* we doubled the stellar yield in order to obtain a better match to the stellar colours ( see discussion in font et al , 2008 ) and to increase the icm metal abundances . with this higher yield ,",

    "such a steepening of the relation is consistent with more recent analysis ( wyithe 2006 ) and is also supported by analysis of the central structure of brightest cluster and group galaxies ( lauer et al .",
    "at the start of this paper , our challenge was to build a model that was simultaneously able to account for the observed properties of galaxies such as the luminosity function and the x - ray properties of groups and clusters . in this way we are seeking a model that accounts for both the number and distribution of stars in the universe and the thermodynamic properties of the material that is left over from the galaxy formation process .",
    "the importance of this second aspect is emphasised by looking at the mass fraction that it contains : in galaxy clusters more than 90% of the baryons are left over as a by - product . in currently popular galaxy formation models , including the b06 , roughly one eighth of this material has been processed through stars , but a much larger fraction has been accreted by galaxies and then ejected in the form of galactic winds .    to rise to the challenge of modelling the icm , we have made a relatively simple modification to the highly successful galaxy formation model presented in b06 . in b06 , we included a `` radio mode '' of agn feedback , allowing the energy injected from such sources to offset radiative cooling in hydrostatic haloes . on its own",
    "this model fails spectacularly to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosities of groups and clusters . in this paper , we have taken the radio - mode feedback process a step further , allowing the radio mode feedback to eject gas from the x - ray emitting regions of hydrostatic haloes .",
    "this modification of the model is largely successfully in reproducing the observed correlations between x - ray luminosity and system temperature . in particular , as well as reproducing the median slope of the relation , the model reproduces the large scatter in the observed luminosities of lower temperature systems . when we take into account the distinction between the model virial temperatures and the observed spectroscopic temperatures the normalisation of the relations is also in good agreement .",

    "the redshift dependence of the model thus differs from that expected in a simple preheating scenario ( where we expect weaker than gravitational evolution ) .",
    "although the large scatter in the l  t relation below @xmath86 makes the evolution hard to measure , this issue clearly deserves further observational effort .",
    "the major problem for the model is the high level of heating required from the agn .",
    "this is an inevitable consequence of assuming that the heating occurs after the system s collapse ( mccarthy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "thus , while the model requires only low values for the efficiency with which matter is accreted onto the central black hole , the predicted heating rates exceed the cooling rates by factors of 10 ( at 5 kev ) to 100 ( below 1 kev ) in active systems . this conflicts with observational estimates of cluster heating rates that suggest that radio - mode heating is just sufficient to balance cooling in the more massive systems ( birzan et al",

    "clearly a much more detailed comparison of the energetics of the model with observational data is needed , paying careful attention to the observational selection effects and the difficulty in observing bubbles in distant or low surface brightness systems .",
    "it may also be possible that a more complex form for the modification of the cluster density profile might result in lower x - ray luminosities for a given energy input .",

    "t relation with lower values of the efficiency parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "the modification of the model alters the properties of the galaxies formed , but we find that small adjustments to the parameters in the b06 model are able to restore reasonably good agreement with observational constraints . in order to achieve a good fit",
    "we need to slightly raise the threshold at which haloes become hydrostatic and to decrease the dynamical friction orbital decay rate . without the latter modification ,",
    "excessive merging tends to produce a tail of excessively bright galaxies and a power - law ( rather than exponential ) break in the luminosity function .",
    "we have demonstrated the success of the model in reproducing the broad - brush observational x - ray properties of groups and clusters .",
    "however , a number of issues require closer examination and an improved model that goes beyond a simple ad - hoc modification of the cluster density profile .",
    "in particular , we have not attempted to address the detailed entropy profiles of these systems . in its current form ,",
    "the model is unsuitable for this .",
    "to tackle such issues requires two developments .",
    "firstly , we need to consider the distribution of excess gas entropies and to be able to propagate this through the merger hierarchy .",
    "for example , mccarthy et al . ( 2007 ) show that a low mass substructure that has experienced little non - gravitational heating tends to drop to the centre of a higher mass halo into which it is accreted with little increase in entropy . in this way",
    "it is quite simple to produce a small mass of low entropy ( rapidly cooling ) material embedded in a halo of high entropy ( long cooling time ) gas .",
    "this complexity is not handled by the currently model since we only track the average non - gravitational energy in a halo .",
    "the second aspect of the model that needs consideration is to allow for the possibility that agn activity and supernovae might eject some gas from haloes even if they are not in the hydrostatic regime .",
    "this is a tricky issue that is difficult to assess without resort to direct numerical simulations ( eg .",
    ", dav et al . 2008 ) . both of these effects will tend to amplify the energy input at earlier epochs making the energetic demands of the model much less daunting",
    ". the effect may be particularly relevant at intermediate temperatures where the required heating rates appear most incompatible with the observational estimates .    in summary",
    ", the current model demonstrates that we are well on the way to understanding physical process that set the combined properties of the galaxy population and the thermodynamic history of the intra - cluster medium . while the model might not yet present a complete solution it provides us with great insight into the physical processes at work .",

    "<S> only @xmath010% of baryons in the universe are in the form of stars , yet most models of luminous structure formation have concentrated on the properties of the luminous stellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> such models are now largely successful at reproducing the observed properties of galaxies , including the galaxy luminosity function and the star formation history of the universe . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the `` flip side '' of galaxy formation and investigate the properties of the material that is not presently locked up in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this `` by - product '' of galaxy formation can be observed as an x - ray emitting plasma ( the intracluster medium , hereafter icm ) in groups and clusters . since </S>",
    "<S> much of this material has been processed through galaxies , observations of the icm represent an orthogonal set of constraints on galaxy formation models . in this paper , we attempt to self - consistently model the formation of galaxies and the heating of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> we set out the challenges for such a combined model and demonstrate a possible means of bringing the model into line with both sets of constraints .    in this paper , we present a version of the durham semi - analytic galaxy formation model galform that allows us to investigate the properties of the icm . as we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments , the previous model ( presented in bower et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2006 ) fails to reproduce even the most basic observed properties of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple modification to the model to allow for heat input into the icm from the agn `` radio mode '' feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this heating acts to expel gas from the x - ray luminous central regions of the host halo . with this modification </S>",
    "<S> , the model reproduces the observed gas mass fractions and luminosity - temperature ( l  t ) relation of groups and clusters . </S>",

    "<S> t relation , particularly at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the model is energetically plausible , but seems to exceed the observed heating rates of intermediate temperature clusters . introducing the heating process into the model requires changes to a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observed galaxy properties . with the revised parameters , </S>",

    "<S> the new model makes a fundamental step forward , providing a unified model of galaxy and cluster icm formation . </S>",
