    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) is capable of detecting two different forms of emission from photoionized gas in the star forming regions within other galaxies .",
    "first , alma can measure continuum emission at 85 - 100  ghz where the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies are dominated by free - free emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , alma is sensitive enough to detect recombination line emission that appears at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "both free - free and millimetre recombination line emission as star formation tracers have advantages over ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared tracers in that they are unaffected by dust attenuation . unlike infrared or radio continuum emission , the millimetre continuum and recombination line emission directly traces of photoionized gas and therefore should be more reliable for measuring accurate star formation rates ( sfrs ) . for additional discussion about this , see @xcite .",
    "millimetre continuum observations of nearby galaxies have been relatively straightforward , but the recombination line emission has been more difficult to detect . before alma ,",
    "the millimetre recombination lines have been detected in multiple star forming regions within the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but extragalactic millimeter recombination line emission has only been detected in m82 @xcite , ngc 253 @xcite , and arp 220 @xcite .",
    "alma is capable of reaching sensitivity levels at least an order of magnitude better than other telescopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a technical overview ) and can therefore lead to detections in many more nearby infrared - luminous sources than was previously possible @xcite . at this time , however , alma detections of specifically recombination line emission have been limited .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the detection of millimetre recombination line emission from the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  253 , and @xcite used the 99.02  ghz continuum and h40@xmath0 ( 99.02 ghz ) line emission to measure electron temperatures , sfrs , and ( along with near - infrared data ) dust attenuation in the centre of the galaxy . @xcite reported the marginal detection of h26@xmath0 emission from arp 220 , but the presence of the nearby hcn(4 - 3 ) line made it difficult to perform any analysis with this line detection .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the detection of 85.69  ghz and h42@xmath0 recombination line emission from the centre of ngc  4945 , a nearby ( 3.8@xmath20.3  mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spiral galaxy with an optical disc of 20.0@xmath63.8  arcmin @xcite .",
    "while the galaxy contains a composite active galactic nucleus and starburst nucleus and while the agn is one of the brightest hard x - ray source as seen from earth @xcite , analyses based on near- and mid - infrared emission lines imply that the starburst is the primary energy source for exciting the photoionized gas and that the agn is heavily obscured @xcite .",
    "the central region is very dusty , so even near - infrared star formation tracers such as pa@xmath0 lines are strongly attenuated @xcite .",
    "in such a source , millimetre star formation tracers would provide a much more accurate measurement of sfr .",
    "previously , the only detection of millimetre or radio recombination line emission from ngc  4945 were the h91@xmath0 and h92@xmath0 lines observed by @xcite .",
    "however , these low - frequency lines are significantly more affected by masing and collisional broadening effects than millimetre lines @xcite , and the photoionized gas is typically optically thick at radio wavelengths but optically thin at millimetre wavelengths . given this , the millimetre continuum and line data should provide a better measure of sfr than the radio line data .",
    "after a description of the data in section  [ s_data ] , we present the analysis and the discussion of the results in five sections . section  [ s_image ] presents the images and also shows simple models fit to the data .",
    "section  [ s_spec ] shows the spectra as well as maps of the parameters describing the recombination line profiles .",
    "section  [ s_sed ] presents the sed of the emission from the central source between 3 and 350  ghz , which we used to determine the fraction of continuum emission originating from free - free emission .",
    "section  [ s_te ] presents the derivation of electron temperatures ( @xmath8 ) from the ratio of the millimetre recombination line to the free - free continuum emission and discusses the results in the context of other measurements within ngc 4945 , the milky way galaxy , and other galaxies .",
    "section  [ s_sfr ] describes the measurement of sfrs from the millimetre data , the measurement of sfrs from infrared data , and sfr measurements based on published radio continuum photometry as well as previously - published sfr measurements based on other radio data .",
    "we then perform a comparison of these various sfr measurements to identify consistencies between the measurements and to understand the reasons why some measurements may appear inconsistent with others .",
    "a summary of all of the results is presented in section  [ s_conclu ] .",
    "the alma observations , which were part of project 2012.1.00912.s ( pi : c. henkel ) , were performed in a single execution block on 24 january 2013 with 31 operational antennas ( after flagging ) .",
    "the array was in a compact configuration with baselines extending from 15 to 445  m. the observations consist of a single pointing aimed at the centre of the galaxy , and the total on - source integration time was 33.94 min .",
    "the spectral window containing the h42@xmath0 line was centered on 85.895 ghz , contained 1920 channels with a width of 976.6 khz ( 3.4 km s@xmath4 ) , and included both polarizations .",
    "the bandpass calibrator was j1427 - 4207 , the flux calibrator was j1107 - 448 , and the phase calibrator was j1248 - 4559 .",
    "the data were reprocessed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) version 4.5.0 .",
    "first , we applied a series of a priori calibration steps , including phase corrections based on water vapour radiometer measurements and amplitude corrections based on system temperatures , to the visibility data .",
    "next , we flagged noisy or anomalous visibility data .",
    "after this , we derived and applied corrections to the phase and amplitude as a function of frequency and time .",
    "the visibility data for the spectral window containing the h42@xmath0 line were then converted into image cubes using clean in casa with the cotton - schwab imager algorithm and with natural weighting .",
    "two versions of the image cube were created .",
    "one version of the image cube included the continuum emission .",
    "the other version was continuum - subtracted based on a linear fit to line - free regions in visibility channels 400 - 560 ( sky frequencies 86.288 - 86.444  ghz ) , 1000 - 1200 ( sky frequencies 85.663 - 85.859  ghz ) , and 1440 - 1500 ( sky frequencies 85.370 - 85.429  ghz ) ; no other regions in the spectrum were clear of spectral lines .",
    "the final image cubes cover the full frequency range of the spectral window ( sky frequencies 84.960 - 86.831  ghz ) , and the image cube channels are set to be 4 times the size of the visibility channels , which results in a channel width of 3.906  mhz ( 13.7  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the final image cubes have pixel scales of 0.5  arcsec and dimensions of 256@xmath6256 pixels ( 128@xmath6128  arcsec ) , which covers the primary beam .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the reconstructed beams are 2.6@xmath62.3  arcsec .",
    "primary beam corrections are applied to the images after they are created .",
    "the total h42@xmath0 flux in each map pixel was calculated by summing the signal between channels 310 and 365 ( sky frequencies 85.401 - 85.616  ghz ) in the continuum - subtracted image .",
    "the continuum in each map pixel was calculated by subtracting the cube without the continuum emission from the cube with the continuum and then finding the median of all continuum values between channels 310 and 365 .",
    "the accuracy of the measured sfrs will depend upon the accuracy of the flux calibration based on j1107 - 448 .",
    "we used all archival flux monitoring data from between 120 days before to 120 days after the observations to estimate the flux densities for j1107 - 448 . in the spectral window with the h42@xmath0 line ,",
    "the flux density at the central frequency of 85.895  ghz is estimated as @xmath9  jy . however , the measurements in band 3 vary by 6% over this time period , so we will use that as the calibration uncertainty for both the line and continuum measurements . as an additional check of the flux calibration , we compared the flux densities from a continuum image of j1427 - 4207 to archival flux monitoring data .",
    "the flux density at this frequency estimated from the archival data is 7.5@xmath20.2  jy , but the archival data for band 3 vary by 17% ( or 1.2  jy ) within the 240 day period we used . the flux density we measure at 85.895",
    "ghz is 7.99  jy , which is consistent with this measurement to within @xmath16% .",
    "global flux densities for ngc  4945 in the 80 - 90  ghz range have been measured by the _ wilkinson _",
    "microwave anisotropy probe and by the _ planck _ mission . however , the angular resolution of the data from these telescopes is so broad that it is difficult to extract flux densities for the central starburst for comparison to the alma data .",
    "the only published continuum data from the 80 - 90  ghz range are the 89  ghz continuum data from the australia compact telescope array ( atca ) published by @xcite .",
    "they did not publish an integrated continuum flux density for the central region but instead only report the results of a gaussian fit to the central source ; the best fitting parameters give a flux density of 0.28  jy . the total continuum emission we measure with alma at 85.69",
    "ghz is 0.36@xmath20.02  jy ( see section  [ s_sed ] ) .",
    "the numbers differ by @xmath125% .",
    "@xcite did not publish any uncertainties related to their measurement , but the typical flux calibration uncertainties for atca at the time of the observations was @xmath130% ( stevens , private communication ) .",
    "given this , the difference does not seem significant .",
    "additionally , the @xcite data should be treated as a lower limit for the actual flux density since their continuum image shows some non - gaussian asymmetries and extended structure that may not be included in the part of the data described by the gaussian fit .",
    "given this , we will assume that the alma flux calibration is reliable to within 6% for our analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath10 the alma sfrs used in this comparison are integrated over the entire central disc ( the t region in figure  [ f_map_measreg ] .",
    "+ @xmath11 the uncertainties in the mid - infrared sfr are 0.20  dex , which is equivalent to a factor of 1.6 .",
    "the resulting sfr from the mid - infrared data is @xmath12 lower than the sfr from the alma data , from the total infrared flux , or from any radio data published in the literature .",
    "if anything , it was expected that the mid - infrared fluxes should yield high sfr measurements because they should also include emission from dust heated by the agn .",
    "given the agreement ( within a factor of @xmath12 ) of the other sfr measurements , the most likely explanation is that the sfr from the mid - infrared flux density is abnormally low compared to the actual sfr .",
    "it is unlikely that the mid - infrared flux densities are measured incorrectly . while the _ spitzer _ data could have been affected by detector saturation effects",
    ", the fact that we were able to measure the same sfr in the wise data would indicate that such effects are unlikely to be a cause for the flux density mismatch .",
    "if we corrected the central flux density of the _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath5 m or wise 22  @xmath5 m data so that it corresponded to a sfr of @xmath14  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , the global flux densities at these wavelengths would need to be increased by @xmath180  jy or a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ and wise data show no signs of any instrumental effects that could cause such discrepancies , and if the _",
    "spitzer _ or wise flux densities were corrected by this amount , the results would be discrepant with the iras 25  @xmath5 m flux densities .",
    "the centre of ngc  4945 may be a source where the mid - infrared flux yields an underestimate of the sfr because the relation between the 24  @xmath5 m and total infrared flux is atypical .",
    "the conversion between _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath5 m emission and sfr derived by @xcite is based upon the assumption that the ratio of 24  @xmath5 m flux ( expressed as @xmath13 ) to total infrared flux should be 0.158 . in the case of the centre of ngc  4945 , the ratio is @xmath10.02 . two phenomena could suppress the mid - infrared emission relative to the total infrared flux in the centre of ngc  4945 .",
    "first , based on empirical analyses , the relation between 24  @xmath5 m and total infrared flux is expected to become nonlinear at high infrared surface brightnesses .",
    "@xcite state that such a nonlinearity should be seen at @xmath14 l@xmath3 , but this is based on globally - integrated flux densities , whereas the point at which the relation becomes nonlinear should depend primarily on the intensity of the illuminating radiation field .",
    "when the dust emission comes from a very compact source like the centre of ngc 4945 , it is possible that the relation becomes nonlinear at luminosities lower than @xmath15 l@xmath3 .",
    "however , in the sample of galaxies studied by @xcite , the nonlinearity effects are expected to be relatively small and not on the order of a factor of 10 .",
    "it is more likely that the mid - infrared emission is suppressed because the central starburst is optically thick in mid - infrared bands .",
    "this has been seen in other compact luminous sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the conversion from 24  @xmath5 m emission to sfr clearly relies upon the assumption that the dust emission is optically thin .",
    "if the dust is not optically thin in the mid - infrared , the emission in this waveband will be suppressed relative to longer wavelengths , and the resulting sfr will be lower .",
    "the ratio of the mid - infrared sfr ( 0.4  m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) to the average of the alma sfrs ( 4.35  m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) is 0.092 .",
    "assuming the 24  @xmath5 m flux density is suppressed by this factor , the dust attenuation can be expressed as @xmath16 in magnitude units as 2.6 . applying the @xcite renormalized versions of the @xcite extinction curve for @xmath17=5.5 , which appears to replicate mid - infrared dust extinction measurements within very dusty milky way regions ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , this @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath18=150 and @xmath19=17 .",
    "this high extinction would be consistent with the @xmath2050 @xmath18 values estimated by @xcite is similar to the result from @xcite , they measure a 100  @xmath5 m flux density of 705 jy for the nucleus , which is lower than our measurement of @xmath21  jy . ] , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "since @xmath130% of the global mid - infrared emission from ngc  4945 originates from the central starburst , it is readily apparent that the globally integrated mid - infrared flux density will yield an underestimate of the global star formation rate for this galaxy .",
    "if we apply equation  [ e_sfr_mir ] to the globally - integrated _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath5 m flux density of 31.9  jy , we obtain a sfr of 1.4  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "if we correct the nuclear sfr from 0.4 to 4  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , the global sfr becomes 5  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is a change of a factor of @xmath13.5 .",
    "these results have major implications for measuring the star formation rate within galaxies with compact , dusty starbursts similar to the one in ngc  4945 .",
    "while the central starburst in ngc  4945 is unusual compared to the nuclei of most other galaxies within 10 mpc of the milky way galaxy , it is similar in intensity circumnuclear starbursts in galaxies like m82 , m83 , and ngc 253 , and it should be representative of the central starbursts seen in many luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath22 ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath23 ) . in ngc  4945 , 25 - 75% of the emission in any infrared waveband originates from the central region , which is similar to what is seen in many of these other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if mid - infrared emission is used by itself to measure global sfrs in these classes of objects , as is very commonly done with _",
    "spitzer _ or wise data and as could be done with the _ james webb _ space telescope , the resulting measurements could be significantly biased downwards .",
    "in addition to the obvious issues with measuring sfr , the results here also have implications for modelling dust emission from galaxies with compact central starbursts .",
    "when applying dust emission models or radiative transfer models to the infrared seds of galaxies , it is important to use models that account for not only the high opacities in the mid - infrared but also the shift in dust emission to longer wavelengths .",
    "we have presented here alma observations of 85.69  ghz continuum emission and h42@xmath0 line emission from the centre of ngc  4945 .",
    "these data are one of only a small number of currently - existing alma data that include the detection of recombination line emission from an extragalactic source , and our analysis is one of the earliest comparisons of sfr measurements from alma data with sfr measurements from infrared data . in summary , we have obtained the following results :    @xmath24 the 85.69  ghz continuum and h42@xmath0 line emission originates from a structure that can be modelled as an exponential disc with a scale length of @xmath12.1  arcsec ( @xmath140  pc ) . the spatial extent of the emission as well as the absence of any enhancement in the centre as well as the absence of any broad line emission suggest that the emission originates primarily from photoionized gas associated with the circumnuclear starburst and not from the agn .",
    "@xmath24 the sed for the central source implies that 84%@xmath2510% of the 85.69  ghz continuum emission from the central disc originates from free - free emission .",
    "@xmath24 the @xmath8 for the central star forming disc based on the ratio of the h42@xmath0 line emission to 85.69  ghz free - free emission is @xmath26  k. this is similar to what is measured near the centre of the milky way .",
    "these results also imply that the agn contributes @xmath2710% of the total continuum emission from the central disc .",
    "@xmath24 the sfr for the central source derived from both the 85.69  ghz continuum and h42@xmath0 line emission is @xmath28  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is comparable to what we obtain using the total infrared flux , and it is consistent with the range of sfr values estimated from previous radio recombination line measurements .",
    "@xmath24 the sfr measurements from either previously - published radio continuum data or from radio observations of supernovae are a factor of @xmath12 higher than what is obtained from the alma data .",
    "this is potentially related to a combination of calibration issues with the estimates of the sfr based on the radio data or changes in the sfr between 3 - 40  myr ago and the present .",
    "@xmath24 the sfr measurements from _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath5 m and wise 22  @xmath5 m data are @xmath110@xmath6 lower than the measurements based on the alma data as well as the measurement based on the total infrared flux or the measurements based on radio data .",
    "this probably occurs because the central starburst is optically thick at mid - infrared wavelengths , which is a condition where the conversion between mid - infrared flux and sfr should no longer yield reliable results .",
    "this analysis not only demonstrates how effective alma can be in terms of studying star formation in the centres of starburst galaxies but also how such alma observations can be used to cross - check sfr measurements from both infrared and radio data .",
    "mid - infrared flux has been favoured for use as a star formation tracer because of how well the emission has been correlated with other ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared star formation tracers and because it had been assumed that mid - infrared emission is not affected by the same dust extinction effects as star formation tracers at shorter wavelength .",
    "the results here demonstrate that mid - infrared fluxes may not be reliable star formation tracers in compact starbursts .",
    "additional alma observations of star forming regions in other nearby galaxies should be used to explore the reliability of infrared emission as a star formation metric for such dusty systems .",

    "<S> we present observations of the 85.69  ghz continuum emission and h42@xmath0 line emission from the central 30  arcsec within ngc  4945 . </S>",
    "<S> both sources of emission originate from nearly identical structures that can be modelled as exponential discs with a scale length of @xmath12.1  arcsec ( or @xmath140 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the spectral energy distribution based on combining these data with archival data imply that 84%@xmath210% of the 85.69  ghz continuum emission originates from free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> the electron temperature is 5400@xmath2600  k , which is comparable to what has been measured near the centre of the milky way galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rate ( sfr ) based on the h42@xmath0 and 85.69  ghz free - free emission ( and using a distance of 3.8  mpc ) is 4.35@xmath20.25 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the sfr from the total infrared flux and with previous measurements based on recombination line emission , and it is within a factor of @xmath12 of sfrs derived from radio data . the _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> space telescope 24  @xmath5 m data and wide - field infrared survey explorer 22  @xmath5 m data yield sfrs @xmath110@xmath6 lower than the alma measurements , most likely because the mid - infrared data are strongly affected by dust attenuation equivalent to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that sfrs based on mid - infrared emission may be highly inaccurate for dusty , compact circumnuclear starbursts .    </S>",
