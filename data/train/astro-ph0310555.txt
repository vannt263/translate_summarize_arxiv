    "40004000  = 1000              observations of large areas of the sky in the x - ray ( 1 - 20 kev ) and gamma - ray ( 20 - 1000 kev ) passbands have found bursts of x - rays  x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "the properties of xrfs are reviewed in ( for example ) and are observationally distinct from ( but may be related to ) the ubiquitous and relatively well - studied gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the phenomenological definition of these events , proposed by ( h02  hereafter ) , includes strong 2 - 10 kev emission , in which the 2 - 10 kev fluence is greater than the 50 - 300 kev fluence ; a duration of   few  s ( to distinguish from flare - stars ) ; and the absence of a strong optical or ir counterpart ( to distinguish from x - ray binaries and coronally active stars ) .",
    "these phenomena have recently been surveyed h02  using _",
    "bepposax_/wfc observations ( 2 - 25 kev sensitivity ) over 6 years and a 40@xmath440 sq deg field of view .",
    "this resulted in a detection of 34 of these events , with typical x - ray fluxes of  ( 2 - 20 kev ) . and describe xrfs in detail .",
    "xrfs can be observationally distinguished from the well - studied type - i x - ray bursts , which are due to thermonuclear flashes on the surfaces of neturon stars ( nss ) in accreting low - mass x - ray binaires ( see for a review ) ; the type - i x - ray bursts have @xmath5 rise - times and exponential decays with characteristic timescales of 10-@xmath6 , during which the thermal spectrum softens as the ns atmosphere cools .",
    "xrfs , by contrast , have non - thermal spectra , and their lightcurves typically do not follow a fast - rise / exponential decay time profile .    at present",
    ", the origin of the xrfs is unclear .",
    "some grb models permit similar bursts at lower photon energies , by altering just one parameter of the model .",
    "an example of such a model is the so - called hypernova model , in which the details of the characteristics of the progenitor star ( e.g. mass , spin ) may play a critical role in determining the energy band of the prompt emission . in such a case , the xrfs would originate from a similar parent population to the grbs ( at cosmological distances , in star - forming galaxies ) , and thus share some observational properties with grbs  such as an homogenous distribution on the sky , and a break in the logn  logs cumulative distribution due to cosmological ( and , perhaps , source population ) evolution .",
    "another example of a grb - origin model which can produce the xrfs is to place the grbs at high redshift , so that the spectral energy distribution peaks at a lower energy .",
    "however , the optical detection of the host galaxies associated with xrf  011030 @xcite and xrf 020427 @xcite make this explanation less likely",
    ". other grb models  such as inspiralling binary nss , which may not vary in the energy band where most of their energy is emitted  may not be able to accommodate the xrf phenomena , in which case the xrfs could originate from a distinct population .",
    "data accumulated from x - ray satellites may contain previously unrecognized x - ray flashes ( unresolved transients lasting o[10 - 100 s ] ) . events with characteristics similar to x - ray flashes have been claimed detected in _",
    "observatory data @xcite , down to  in 1.5@xmath7 of data ( 0.2 - 3.5 kev ) for a @xmath8 fov , for a total integration of 1.5@xmath9 , in which 42 events were detected ; the implied burst rate is 3.7 events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  at a fluence of 2 . a search with _ rosat_/pspc @xcite with a comparable exposure and flux limit ( 1.6@xmath7 , 2.7@xmath10 fov , 0.12.4 kev ) found no bursts , producing a 90% confidence upper - limit ( @xmath112 bursts ) of 6.1 events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  above a fluence of 2.6 , which contradicts the _ einstein _ result .    the new generation of sensitive x - ray observatories ( _ chandra _ , _",
    "xmm_-newton ) offer a new opportunity to search for these events with detectors having new characteristics , most notably in spectral response .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic absorption of x - ray flashes is unknown ; if the absorption in x - ray flashes were , on average , high ( @xmath12 ) then a low detected rate with rosat ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) could still translate in to a detected xrf rate in excess of that expected from a an @xmath13 law .",
    "we performed such a search in a number of observations from _ xmm_-newton - epic / pn ; although we find two non - poissonian events , their astrophysical origin is not confirmed with fully simultaneous observation with _ xmm_-newton - epic / mos ; we conclude that the events are anomolous to the epic / pn detector .",
    "we subsequently set upper - limits for the full - sky xrf rate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : feasibility ] , we estimate detectable burst rates for sensitive x - ray observatories , finding that the most sensitive instrument to the phenomenon is the xmm - newton epic / pn detector . in   3 , we describe the _",
    "xmm_-newton  dataset we used , and the detection algorithm , together with source characterization procedures and xrf detection sensitivity calculations . in ",
    "4 we give the results of our search , and describe the xrf detection sensitivity .",
    "we discuss these results in   5 and",
    "conclude in ",
    "6 .      the feasibility of detection of xrfs with a particular instrument may be extrapolated from the number of flashes detected with sax / wfc ( h02 ) . assuming the objects producing the flashes are isotropically and homogenously distributed the number of detectable flashes scales as        in this feasibility study we assume a significant detection requires a minimum flux corresponding to one count per second at the detector chip at the peak of the xrf .",
    "this flux was found from webpimms and is dependent on the spectral shape of the flash , which we took to be a photon spectral slope between @xmath2=1.22.0 , as observed with sax / wfc @xcite .",
    "data from the chandra acis and the xmm - newton epic / pn and mos cameras are available to us in public archives . using eqn .",
    "[ eq : flashrateextrapolation ] the total xrfs per sky per year at a given flux rate ( and so a given detector sensitivity ) were extrapolated from those observed with sax / wfc . using",
    "the power - law photon index range observed with sax / wfc , the solid angle field - of - view of the detectors , and the total integrated time using each detector , we calculated the expected detectable number of events ( table [ tab : feasibility ] ) in the presently available data .",
    "the xmm - newton epic / pn detector offers the greatest chance of flash detection in available data .",
    "we focus on the epic / pn detector , but it should be noted that our algorithms are applicable to other datasets and can be used , for example , without modification with epic mos data . depending on the spectrum ,",
    "the epic / mos1 + 2 detectors ( together ) have @xmath050% of the effective area of the epic / pn detector . as the mos and pn detectors observe the same region of sky simultaneously ,",
    "coincidence of events on both detectors may be used for confirmation of the astrophysical origin of transients .          1 .",
    "we use observations publicly or otherwise available to us on 2002 june 1 ; 2 .",
    "observations with @xmath19 50 ks total observation time ( including periods in which the detector was switched off ) .",
    "extension to smaller observation times increases the chance of flash detection proportional to the total integration time , but at an increased overhead of file handling and data collation ; 50 ks was chosen as a compromise value .",
    "observations within 15@xmath20 latitude to the galactic equator were excluded to reduce the incidence of transients from galactic sources ( x - ray binaries , for example ) .    applying these criteria we analysed",
    "225.1ks of observations , split into 6 separate observations with total detector - on times ranging from 19939s to 47721s .",
    "the algorithms described below can be applied to new data as it becomes available .",
    "simulations using webpimms and the observed background spectrum suggested that detection sensitivity would be increased by removing counts with energies below 0.4  kev .",
    "we therefore only consider counts between 0.4 and 15 kev .",
    "an outline of our xrf detection algorithm is as follows .",
    "we split observation event lists into short sections of time , with duration of 500@xmath7 , with 100@xmath7 of overlap between adjacent sections . within each time section ,",
    "we bin counts into a @xmath21 bin data cube .",
    "each bin volume is 9.95@xmath49.95  spatially and has a duration of @xmath22 .",
    "we thus oversample both the point - spread - function ( psf ; @xmath050 ) and the desired optimal burst duration .",
    "we took this duration to be 10s , which importantly affects the duration of transients to which this search is sensitive .",
    "10s is a characteristic timescale for xrf events , although some events of much longer duration have also been observed .",
    "a 3-dimensional sliding _ celldetect _",
    "algorithm is used to search for volumes ( corresponding to 1 psf spatially and one transient duration temporally ) which have a significantly elevated count rate compared to their local background .",
    "the local background is estimated from the count in the adjacent 3 psf @xmath4 3 transient duration volume surrounding the test volume ( that is , a spatio - temporal integration which is 26@xmath4 as large as the test volume ) .",
    "poisson statistics are used to determine the significance of the local counts given the background .",
    "bins in which the fractional value of the detector exposure map is @xmath110.35 ( where 1.0 is an exposure time equal to the total detector exposure time ) are ignored .",
    "the algorithm calculates the local count significances throughout the binned cube , with detection positions overlapping by 4/11 of the psf diameter and by 4/5 of the transient duration . as the _",
    "xmm_-newton  psf radius changes only modestly with off - axis angle , a changing psf size will not affect our results .",
    "the list of candidate xrf events for each observation ( typically containing @xmath0300 events ) is then reduced .",
    "each observation contains periods of high background , in which the count rate may be more than an order of magnitude higher than the average value during the observation .",
    "these periods often have a rise time comparable to the transient search length ( see figure  [ fig : event times ] ) , and give rise to spurious detections .",
    "we therefore remove sources that occur within high background periods . a high background period is found ( and defined ) as follows :    1 .",
    "split the detector into a 10@xmath410 grid of rectangular spatial regions .",
    "2 .   find the time - averaged countrate for the entire observation in each region .",
    "3 .   for each region , rebin the event list into time periods of one nominal transient duration ( 10 ) . any bin with a count rate @xmath23 the time - averaged count rate for that region",
    "is flagged as a possible high background bin for that region .",
    "4 .   to avoid counting a very bright transient as a background flare , only time bins in which @xmath19 4 regions are flagged as possible high background are flagged as whole - chip background flares .",
    "steps 24 are repeated three times , taking the time average only over periods not flagged as high background .    if necessary , the remaining sources are flagged as redundant - any particular transient is likely to be detected more than once due to the spatial and temporal overlaps in the detection algorithm .",
    "candidate events close to the edge of chips ( defined as sources with psfs containing regions with fractional exposure @xmath110.35 ) are removed .",
    "poisson variations in count rate within a few psf distance of a bright x - ray source can also produce false detections because of the relatively large spatial variation in the countrate inside our background box .",
    "these bright sources are found manually by the presence of a great ( 1000 + ) excesses of false detections around a bright source .",
    "all candidate events in a circular area with a radius of 7 psfs centered on the bright source are removed ; in practice , this step is most efficiently performed by setting that portion of the detector exposure map to zero in the initial _ celldetect _ algorithm .",
    "a final manual inspection of the remaining sources removes sources near obvious detector anomalies , such as flickering pixels .",
    "five - thousand test transients were initially added to each dataset separate from the detection runs . in each test",
    "transient photon - counts were distributed following gaussian spatial and time profiles ( 90% diameter of 1 psf and 90% duration of 10 ) .",
    "the transients were randomly distributed in a 30 diameter circle centered on the telescope axis , carefully avoiding overlapping in the space - time volume .",
    "the numbers of test transients detected by the _ celldetect _",
    "algorithm at an incoming flux per transient of 7.1  ( 10 total counts , on - axis ) and separately at 1.4  ( 200 total counts , on - axis ) were recorded .",
    "an xrf photon spectral index of 2 was assumed and fluxes are measured over one detection time bin , 2.34 .      the numbers of test transients detected at each flux level for each observation are given in table [ tab : detection efficiency ] .",
    "observations with low detection sensitivities ( @xmath24 test transients detected ) had sensitivity uncertainties reduced by repeating the monte carlo trials several times .",
    "two observations ( 0114120101 and 0097820101 ) had very low ( @xmath25% ) detection sensitivities at the 10-count level ; we do not include these observations in our calculations at that flux level .",
    "we found two candidate events  non - poissonian excesses of counts over their local background  in the _ xmm_-newton - epic - pn observations .",
    "the characteristics of the detections are given in table  [ tab : events ] and a detailed description is given in figures [ fig : 0055_1 ] & [ fig : 01253_1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : event times ] illustrates that neither of our events were due to background flares .    to calculate the total number of counts detected over both events , we correct for the differing exposures of the source and background regions .",
    "this small ( o[5% of counts ] ) effect is due to exposure variations across the telescope . correcting for this effect",
    ", we find a total of @xmath26 counts , including a background of @xmath27 counts on the pn detector .",
    "it should be noted that the candidate events occur within 2 psfs of chip edges , and as such may be chip edge effects .",
    "additionally , all counts comprising the event in observation 0125300101 are within one detector time bin ( 73 ms ) , which could also suggest a detector effect .    [ [ non - confirmation - of - the - astrophysical - nature - of - the - confirmed - events - with - the - mos - detectors ] ] non - confirmation of the astrophysical nature of the confirmed events , with the mos detectors ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the _ xmm_-newton - epic / mos detectors observe the same area of sky fully simultaneously with the pn detector .",
    "therefore , flux from a transient observed with the pn detector should also be detected by the mos chips , albeit at a lower count rate .    integrating over both of the confirmed events in the pn detector ,",
    "a total of 0 counts were detected by the sum of both mos detectors at the same sky locations ( 1 psf spatial bin ) and times ( 10s time bin ) , in a total estimated local background of 0.55@xmath280.16 counts .",
    "correcting for the fractional exposure difference between the mos and pn detectors ( but not their different detector efficiencies ) gives a background of 0.520.15 counts .",
    "we compare the detected mos counts with those expected from the pn counts .",
    "the relative efficiency of the two mos detectors , for a source of photon spectral slope of @xmath2=1.2 is 50% .",
    "thus , we would expect 7.51.9 counts in the mos detectors above background , instead of the @xmath29 counts ( 90% confidence ) observed .",
    "we therefore place an upper - limit of @xmath30% of the detected confirmed pn events being astrophysical in origin ",
    "i.e. neither of our events can be confirmed at the 3-@xmath31 level .      to obtain the upper - limits on the full sky xrf rate , we take our observed upper - limit to be @xmath111 event at the two transient fluxes described above . to calculate our total exposure",
    ", we use the detector area ( a circle of radius 15 ) , the total ontime and the detection fraction from table  [ tab : event rates ] .",
    "since our detection fractions assumed the spatial distribution to be homogenous across the detector , these fractions take into account the presence of bright sources , low - exposure pixels , edge effects and lost detector columns .",
    "the fractions also include sensitivity losses due to ontime during which background flares occured .",
    "the total exposure is therefore 0.19 sq deg @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is for each of six observations , @xmath34 is the time per observation , and @xmath35 is the event detection fraction , which is a function of the number of counts per event .    at the flux",
    "limit corresponding to 10 counts the total exposure is 0.19 sq deg @xmath4 1700 ; at 200 counts , the total exposure is 0.19 sq deg @xmath4 101000 .",
    "the correction factors to events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  are 5.5 and 8.0 respectively .",
    "the corresponding xrf event rate limits are therefore @xmath114.0 events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  at 10 counts per transient and @xmath116.78 events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  at 200 counts per transient .",
    "this number of counts per time - bin corresponds to average fluxes of 7.1  and 1.4 respectively , assuming a spectral power - law photon index @xmath2=2 .",
    "figure [ fig : logn logs ] shows the relation of our upper limits to a previous result @xcite , as well as to an extrapolation from the _",
    "bepposax_/wfc xrf rate assuming a homogenous source population .",
    "our limit is less stringent than the previous result by a factor of @xmath36 , due in large part to the factor @xmath013 greater size fov of the rosat / pspc detector over the pn detector and the longer integration time of the previous result .",
    "the limits are also consistent with the extrapolation of the _ bepposax_/wfc xrf rate assuming a homogenous source population and a power - law photon index of @xmath2=1.2 - although it should be noted that we expected to detect @xmath0 8 events if the xrfs have a power - law photon index of @xmath2=2 .",
    "we conduct searches for flashes in the xmm - newton public archival data , specifically those observations with total observation time @xmath37 and with galactic latitude @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "we use a _ celldetect _ algorithm extended to include three dimensions ( two spatial , one temporal ) .",
    "detected sources are categorized , and non - astronomical sources flagged .",
    "two candidate events were found in epic / pn data , with a total of 153.8 counts in a total estimated background of 0.370.16 counts .",
    "the astrophysical nature of these candidate events is not confirmed by fully simultaneous observations with the epic / mos detectors , and we conclude that we have detected no astrophysical xrfs .",
    "we suggest that the events as observed may be due to detector effects .",
    "from this we place full - sky , 90% confidence upper - limits on the xrf event rate of @xmath114.0 events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  ( at 7.1 ) and @xmath116.8  events@xmath1sky@xmath1yr  ( at 1.4 ) .",
    "the high - flux limit is above a previous limit obtained with _",
    "rosat _ , by a factor of @xmath01500 , due to the larger fov and integration time of the pspc data .",
    "the limit at the lower flux remains above that extrapolated from the _ bepposax_/wfc events assuming homgeneity .",
    "the _ rosat _  limit remains the most stringent limit on an extrapolation of the xrf burst rate to lower - fluxes , and implies that the assumption of homogeneity is violated at a flux @xmath192 . to obtain a limit similar in magnitude to the _ rosat _  limit , using xmm / pn , a total integration time of @xmath02 seconds",
