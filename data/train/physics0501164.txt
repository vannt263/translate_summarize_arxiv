    "particle physicists employ high energy particle accelerators and complex detectors to probe ever smaller distance scales in an attempt to understand the nature and origin of the universe .",
    "the tevatron proton - anti proton collider located in the department of energy s fermi national accelerator laboratory,@xcite batavia , illinois , currently operates at the `` energy frontier '' and has an opportunity of providing new discoveries through the @xcite and cdf@xcite high energy physics ( hep ) experiments .",
    "future experiments , such as atlas@xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite in the european organization for nuclear research ( cern)@xcite and a proposed electron - positron linear collider ( lc)@xcite have the prospects of either building on discoveries made at fermilab , or making the discoveries themselves if nature has placed these new processes beyond the energy reach of the tevatron .",
    "as part of the  experiment s effort to utilize grid technology for the expeditious analysis of data , twelve universities have formed a regional virtual organization ( vo ) , the  southern analysis region ( sar).@xcite the centerpiece of sar is a data and resource hub called a regional analysis center ( rac),@xcite constructed at the university of texas at arlington with the support of nsf mri funds .",
    "each sar member institution constructs an institutional analysis center ( iac ) , which acts as a gateway to other racs and to the grid for the users within that institution .",
    "these iacs combine dedicated rack - mounted servers and personal desktop computers into a local physics analysis cluster .",
    "the data access system for  offline analyses is managed by a database and cataloging system called sequential data access via metadata , or sam.@xcite the mc_runjob package@xcite provides a low - level mc manager that coordinates data files used by and produced with the executables of the mc chain , via scripts produced for the job .",
    "this package is combined with mc task management software called mcfarm@xcite , developed at uta , for automated , highly efficient mc production .",
    "in order to pursue full utilization of grid concepts , we are establishing an operational regional grid called sar - grid using all available resources , including personal desktop computers and large dedicated computer clusters .",
    "we have constructed and are operating sar - grid utilizing a framework called sam - grid@xcite being developed at fermilab .",
    "sar - grid will subsequently be made interoperable under other grid frameworks such as lcg,@xcite teragrid,@xcite grid3,@xcite and open science grid.@xcite wherever possible , we will exploit existing software and technological advances made by these other grid projects .",
    "we plan to develop and implement tools to support easy and efficient user access to the grid and to ensure its robustness .",
    "tools to transfer binary executables and libraries efficiently across the grid for environment - independent execution will be developed .",
    "sar will implement the grid for critical physics data analyses , while at the same time subjecting grid computing concepts to a stress test to its true conceptual level , down to personal desktop computers .",
    "many of the proponents of this project are members of the lhc atlas@xcite experiment and a future experiment under study by the american linear collider physics group,@xcite and will apply the experience gained from sar to these projects .",
    "experimental particle physics has always pushed information technology in directions that have had profound broader impact , with the most spectacular example being cern s development of the world wide web , originally intended to facilitate communication among collaborating physicists spread around the globe .",
    "sar s goal of efficiently using computing resources scattered across the south - central united states for tasks such as complex data reduction and simulation will produce grid computing solutions with broad applicability .",
    "this project will also likely affect how we disseminate and analyze data from future experiments at facilities such as the lhc .",
    "sar will help improve the cyber - infrastructure within the region ; five participating institutions are located in states that are traditionally under - funded for r&d activities .",
    "in addition to technology development , there will also be significant development of human resources in the region , delivering interdisciplinary training in physics and computer science .",
    "information for the broader public will be disseminated on the web .",
    "finally , sar will realize the conceptual grid to the level of personal desktop computers , demonstrating the performance of a grid at its fullest level .",
    "the sar grid will be exploited in critical physics analyses of real and simulated data from the  experiment , and later from lhc and other future experiments .",
    "these data will serve to advance our understanding of nature at the smallest distance scales .",

    "<S> moreover , the widely scattered geographical distribution of  collaborators poses further serious difficulties for optimal use of human and computing resources . </S>",
    "<S> these difficulties will exacerbate in future high energy physics experiments , like the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the computing grid has long been recognized as a solution to these problems . </S>",
    "<S> this technology is being made a more immediate reality to end users in  by developing a grid in the  southern analysis region ( sar ) , sar - grid , using all available resources within it and a home - grown local task manager , mcfarm . </S>",
