    "since the observation of large transverse polarization of produced @xmath0 hyperons in the inclusive reactions @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite in the middle of the 1970 s , there have been many experimental and theoretical investigations aimed at understanding this striking polarization phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the polarization measurements of @xmath0 hyperons produced in these inclusive reactions have been performed in fixed target experiments , and the data showed that the @xmath0 polarizations are large only for large @xmath4 .",
    "this poses a problem if one wants to investigate this observable further using high energy colliders such as rhic , tevatron or lhc , where the capabilities to measure @xmath0 polarization are restricted to the midrapidity region , where @xmath4 is very small .",
    "however , in this paper we point out a way to by - pass this problem by making a less inclusive measurement : to select two - jet events and to measure the jet momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 in addition to the momentum @xmath7 and polarization @xmath8 of the @xmath0 that is part of either of the two jets .",
    "an asymmetry proportional to @xmath9 can then arise , which is neither power suppressed , nor needs to be zero the @xmath0 polarization needs to vanish at @xmath10 due to symmetry reasons . in @xmath11 nuclear effects could allow for a nonvanishing asymmetry at midrapidity .",
    "no such effects have been observed thus far .",
    "] at vanishing @xmath4 of the @xmath0 .",
    "the observable is proportional to @xmath12 in the center of mass frame of the two jets . within a factorized description of the process under consideration ,",
    "such an asymmetry can arise from spin and transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions , which in turn can arise from two types of interactions .",
    "we will point out how the measurement of the suggested asymmetry in principle can allow for a differentiation between these two types of mechanisms . in this way",
    "also hadron collider experiments can contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to @xmath0 polarization , in addition to experiments with electron - positron and lepton - hadron collisions .",
    "it is well - known that transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation functions , nowadays commonly referred to as tmds , can have a nontrivial spin dependence and that the so - called `` @xmath13-odd '' tmds can lead to single spin asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "they are also often referred to as `` naively @xmath13-odd '' , because the appearance of these functions does not imply a violation of time - reversal invariance .",
    "the sivers distribution function @xmath14 , schematically depicted in fig.[siversdistribution ] , is the oldest example of such functions .",

    "furthermore , it generates single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive dis @xcite , which have also been measured to be nonzero @xcite , and it results e.g.   in asymmetric di - jet correlations in @xmath23 @xcite , which however are not yet visible in the data analyzed @xcite .    the fragmentation analogue of the sivers distribution function is called @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it describes the distribution of transversely polarized spin-1/2 hadrons , such as @xmath0 s , inside the jet of a fragmenting _",

    "despite the similarity between the definitions of @xmath24 and @xmath14 , there are some important differences .",
    "nonvanishing @xmath13-odd distribution functions require soft gluonic interactions between the target remnants and the active partons  @xcite .",
    "these interactions can be resummed into wilson lines ( gauge links ) , ensuring the gauge invariance of the operator definitions of the distribution functions  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are two mechanisms to generate @xmath13-odd effects in the fragmentation process : through final - state interactions within the jet , e.g.  between the observed outgoing hadron and the rest of the jet  @xcite , or through soft gluonic interactions between the jet and the hard scattering part ( sometimes also referred to as final - state interactions ) , see figs  [ toddfragmentation]a and [ toddfragmentation]b respectively .",
    "final - state interactions : +   ( -39,0)(0,-1)18 + @xmath24 + ( a )    soft gluon interactions ( gauge links ) : +   ( -39,0)(0,-1)18 + @xmath27 + ( b )    as for the distribution functions , the latter interactions give rise to wilson lines . both effects can be expressed in terms of a tmd fragmentation function . the @xmath0 polarization observable that is the subject of this paper in principle allows for a differentiation between these two effects .",
    "there is considerable interest in this issue , as it could shed light on the color flow dependence of single spin asymmetries and the ( non)universality of transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions .    in recent years",
    "it has become apparent that @xmath13-odd tmds enter in different ways in different processes , depending on the color flow in the partonic subprocesses - even tmds are not excluded , they will not be considered here . ] .",
    "the sign relation between the sivers function appearing in semi - inclusive dis and in drell - yan scattering was the first example of such process dependence @xcite .",
    "more complicated relations were discussed soon afterwards for hadron production processes in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "process dependence may seem at odds with factorization @xcite , but since the color flow dependence can be explicitly taken into account through the determination of the wilson line structure , the process dependence is explicitly calculable and hence , predictive power may be retained albeit in a less straightforward manner . for the specific example of the single spin asymmetry in @xmath23 the effects of color flow dependence",
    "have been taken into account @xcite , leading to a suppression w.r.t .  the standard parton model expectation .",
    "for fragmentation functions the situation is complicated further by the fact that only one of the two mechanisms leading to nonzero @xmath13-odd fragmentation functions depends on the color flow structure @xcite .",
    "however , a claim based on a model calculation @xcite and on more general arguments @xcite has been put forward that for @xmath13-odd fragmentation functions no color flow dependence arises at all .",
    "this makes an experimental test of this dependence , or of its absence , all the more interesting .",
    "we propose to measure it in the process @xmath1 , where the brackets indicate that the @xmath0 is part of one of the two observed jets which are almost back - to - back in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis and its polarization is measured .",
    "this measurement can be done for instance at lhc and rhic , although as we will point out the situation at lhc is more straightforward thanks to the dominance of gluon - gluon scattering in the region of interest .    the @xmath0 polarization observable we put forward here is similar to the sivers effect observable in @xmath28  @xcite , but the @xmath0 polarization observable does not depend on a non - collinearity of jets in the transverse plane .",
    "in other words , even if one were to assume the initial partons to be collinear to the parent hadrons , in which case the jets are exactly back - to - back in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis , an asymmetry can still arise .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the @xmath0 polarization observable is less sensitive to effects that would smear out the partonic @xmath29 kinematics .",
    "this prompts us to ignore contributions that depend on nontrivial spin and transverse momentum dependent effects in the initial states ( which would be proportional to @xmath30 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observable turns out to be very sensitive to the unpolarized @xmath0 fragmentation functions .",
    "the relative importance of contributing partonic subprocesses differs strongly depending on whether one uses for instance the fragmentation functions by de florian et al .",
    "@xcite ( fsv ) or by albino et al .",
    "@xcite ( akk ) . therefore ,",
    "even if no polarization effect is seen , the unpolarized data obtained by the proposed measurement can in any case lead to a considerable improvement in the determination of the unpolarized @xmath0 fragmentation functions .",
    "we will explain why it is necessary to measure both jet momenta and also how it differs from the process @xmath31 .",
    "we will start with a discussion of that process .",
    "anselmino et al .",
    "@xcite have attempted to describe the latter in terms of @xmath24 , but although a satisfactory description of the @xmath0 polarization at larger values of the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 could be obtained , considerable doubts about the applicability of the assumed factorization have arisen afterwards .",
    "a similar problem is unlikely to arise for the @xmath0 polarization study in the process @xmath1 at lhc and rhic .",
    "the @xmath0 s measured in the process @xmath31  @xcite by the fixed target experiments have transverse momenta @xmath32 w.r.t .",
    "the beam direction ranging up to 4 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization transverse to the production plane first grows linearly with @xmath32 , but around @xmath34 gev@xmath33 it levels off and remains approximately constant . for large @xmath32",
    "one expects the polarization to fall off as @xmath35 , based on theoretical ( collinear expansion ) arguments @xcite . the high energy collider experiments would be ideally suited to demonstrate this power - law fall - off behavior , if it were not for the small @xmath4 values probed in those experiments .",
    "the linearly rising behavior at very low @xmath36 is well - described by recombination models employing spin - orbit couplings @xcite .",
    "however , the plateau region for @xmath37 gev@xmath33 is less straightforward to incorporate in such soft physics models .",
    "anselmino et al .",
    "@xcite assumed that the @xmath32 in this region may be considered a hard scale which then would allow for factorization of the cross section expression .",
    "however , since the scale is not too large either , instead of restricting to collinear factorization , transverse momentum dependence at the parton level was included . in this way the @xmath0 polarization could be described in terms of the fragmentation function @xmath24 .",
    "although a satisfactory description of the higher-@xmath32 data was obtained in this way , a preliminary study of the unpolarized cross section within the same factorized approach resulted in considerable disagreement with the data , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . apparently , at large @xmath4 a @xmath32 value of 3 or 4 gev@xmath33 is not yet large enough to allow for a factorized description in the case of @xmath0 production , as opposed to for instance pion production .",
    "inclusion of intrinsic transverse momentum in the initial state parton distributions may lead to less discrepancy with the data , as studied for pion production @xcite , but remains to be done for @xmath0 production .    despite the doubts about whether @xmath24 can be extracted from the existing fixed - target @xmath0 polarization data , the collider experiments at rhic and lhc are in a kinematic region that should allow for a factorized description of the cross section and",
    "thus can be considered safe .",
    "as mentioned , they do have the drawback that @xmath0 measurements are generally restricted to small values of @xmath4 , where the @xmath0 polarization in @xmath31 will be close to zero .",
    "therefore , we next discuss a different process , where this drawback does not appear .    the main difference between the traditional process @xmath31 and the one considered in this paper , @xmath38 comes from the way @xmath24 enters in the asymmetry expressions . in the latter process it enters in an unintegrated way ,",
    "i.e.  the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are observed . in the traditional process on the other hand",
    ", there is an integration over @xmath41 , which implies that one essentially probes the first derivative of the partonic cross section ( in case of collinear initial partons ) , which results in the aforementioned @xmath42 dependence . in @xmath38",
    "this @xmath42 factor does not arise .",
    "we consider the process @xmath43 .",
    "as indicated by the brackets , the @xmath0 is part of the jet with observed momentum @xmath44 , where the two jets are almost back - to - back in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the projections of the outgoing momenta in this plane will be denoted by @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we will also use the scaled variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 . at leading order the hadronic process",
    "is mediated by two - to - two partonic scattering @xmath50 . since in the process under consideration both jet momenta",
    "are observed , the momenta of the outgoing partons are known , i.e.  @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the parton momenta",
    "it is advantageous to make the sudakov decompositions @xmath53 for incoming partons and @xmath54 for the outgoing parton that will fragment into the hyperon .",
    "the @xmath55-vectors are lightlike four - vectors that have nonzero overlaps with the associated hadron momentum ( i.e.  @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there is a certain degree of arbitrariness in the choice of these @xmath55-vectors , but it is required that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are suppressed by inverse powers of one of the hard scales in the process ( such as @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) .",
    "this requirement ensures in the first place that the cross section can be expressed in terms of tmds , i.e.  functions of only the momentum fractions and intrinsic transverse momenta .    by taking @xmath55 to be a measurable four - vector in the process , e.g.  @xmath62 or one of the incoming hadron momenta @xmath63 ( or any linear fixed combination of them provided @xmath64 is large ) ,",
    "one ensures that the observed momentum fraction @xmath40 and intrinsic transverse momentum squared @xmath65 are lorentz invariant .",
    "moreover , for any of these choices the same @xmath40 and @xmath65 result , up to power corrections , which are neglected in our treatment . below we will choose @xmath66 , for which @xmath67 is always small , of order hadronic scale squared divided by the partonic center of mass energy squared .",
    "the momentum fraction and intrinsic transverse momentum of the outgoing parton are then @xmath68 note that @xmath41 refers to the transverse component of the parton s momentum w.r.t .  the @xmath0 direction . the transverse component @xmath69 of the @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "the jet direction is @xmath70 ( note that the subscripts @xmath13 of @xmath69 and @xmath41 refer to different frames @xcite ) .",
    "the tmd fragmentation functions are commonly written with this vector as a variable .",
    "for the cross section we take as a starting point the assumption that for each observed hadron separately the soft physics factorizes from the hard physics : @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "the convolutions @xmath73 indicate the appropriate dirac and color traces for the partonic hard squared amplitude @xmath74 .",
    "the momentum conservation delta function can furthermore be written as @xmath75 where the @xmath76 are the pseudorapidities of the outgoing jets and @xmath77 denote polar angles in the c.o.m .",

    "can be @xmath41-smearing , leading to a dilution of the asymmetry in the final state .",
    "we will , therefore , assume that the boer - mulders effect is less important than the sivers fragmentation effect .",
    "the latter is a @xmath41-effect that is directly in the final state , such that there is no dilution from @xmath41-smearing in the partonic scattering .",
