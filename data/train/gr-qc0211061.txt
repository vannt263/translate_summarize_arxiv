    "gravitational collapse is one of the most important issues in general relativity and in the theoretical research for this phenomenon , the lematre - tolman - bondi(ltb ) solution which describes the motion of spherically symmetric dust fluid has played an important role .",
    "this is a very simple analytic solution of einstein equations but has substantial physical contents .",
    "the simplest but physically significant member of this solution is the case of a homogeneous dust sphere , which is called the oppenheimer - snyder solution .",
    "this solution is the first example to give an elegant picture of a black - hole formation and led to the so - called cosmic censorship conjecture ; roughly speaking , this conjecture states that spacetime singularities except for the big bang are not visible for any observer if it is resulted from physically reasonable initial conditions@xcite . however , this conjecture has not yet been proven although it plays very crucial roles in the proof of the singularity theorems@xcite and the area theorem of black hole@xcite .",
    "rather ltb solution seems to be a candidate of the counterexample of this conjecture .",
    "eardley and smarr pointed out that a shell focusing singularity formed at the symmetric center in an _ inhomogeneous _ dust sphere can be naked , i.e. , visible in principle@xcite .",
    "after this discovery , several theoretical efforts revealed the genericity of the shell focusing naked singularity formation in the ltb solution@xcite ; there are radial null geodesics emanating from the central shell focusing singularity .",
    "the central naked singularity of the dust sphere seems to be a `` point '' since it forms from an infinitesimal portion at the symmetric center of the dust sphere .",
    "however , it is not true . recently ,",
    "mena and nolan showed that there are non - radial null geodesics emanating from this central naked singularity@xcite , where non - radial means that it has a non - vanishing angular momentum .",
    "deshingkar , joshi and dwivedi ( djd ) studied numerically the trajectories of those geodesics within the dust fluid in detail@xcite .",
    "more recently , nolan and mena studied various invariant quantities associated with this central naked singularity and further discussed the topology of this naked singularity@xcite .",
    "it is the main purpose of this article to reveal how the central naked singularity is observed for distant observers outside the dust sphere . for this purpose , we investigate both the radial and non - radial null geodesics emanating from the central naked singularity in the self - similar dust sphere . assuming that the dust sphere has a finite mass , we investigate the angular diameter of the naked singularity , or equivalently , the largest impact parameter of the null geodesics from the naked singularity ; we show its time evolution .",
    "we also clarify the non - uniformity of topology of the central naked singularity for the self - similar case analyzed by nolan and mena@xcite .",
    "we also study angular frequencies of physical fields which propagate along the null geodesics emanating from the central naked singularity .",
    "djd showed that the redshift between the central naked singularity and any off - center observer is infinite@xcite .",
    "hence even if physical fields with finite frequencies are excited at the naked singularity , `` physical '' information of the naked singularity can not reach distant observers .",
    "however , it would not be natural that physical fields with _",
    "finite _ frequencies are generated at the naked singularity where the energy density of the dust fluid and spacetime curvature diverge . in reality ,",
    "linear perturbation analyses of ltb solution show that the spacetime curvature associated to gravitational - wave perturbations indefinitely grows in the limit to the cauchy horizon@xcite .",
    "this means that the frequencies of the linear gravitational waves generated at the naked singularity will be infinite even in purely classical dynamics .",
    "physical fields excited by quantum effects also have infinite frequencies at the naked singularity@xcite .",
    "hence , in this article , we study the angular frequencies of the physical fields emanating from the central naked singularity with appropriately _ infinite _ frequencies .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the model of background spacetime , which describes the gravitational collapse of a self - similar dust sphere with a finite mass . in sec.iii , we derive asymptotic behaviors of the null geodesics near the naked singularity and the basic equations for numerical calculations to see the intermediate behaviors of the null geodesics inside the dust sphere . in this section , we comment on the previous study about the topology of the naked singularity by nolan and mena . in sec.iv , we explain the null geodesics in the exterior vacuum region . in sec.v , we present the numerical results for the apparent size of the naked singularity , i.e. , the angular diameter of the central naked singularity , or equivalently , the largest impact parameter of the singular null geodesic . in sec.vi , the frequencies of physical fields propagating along null geodesics emanating from the central naked singularity are investigated .",
    "finally , sec.vii is devoted for summary and discussion .    in this article",
    ", we adopt the unit @xmath0 and follow the sign conventions of the metric and riemann tensors in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section , we show the model of background spacetime ; the gravitational collapse of a self - similar dust sphere with a finite mass .",
    "we assume that the dust fluid exists only within a finite comoving region @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a positive constant .",
    "dust fluid elements move along timelike geodesics .",
    "we can adopt the tangent vector of these geodesics as a temporal coordinate basis .",
    "then the line element is written in the form @xmath3 where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the comoving radial coordinate @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is an arbitrary function . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the components of the 4-velocity of the dust fluid elements are @xmath6 .",
    "einstein equations and the equation of motion for the dust fluid lead to @xmath7 where a dot means the temporal derivative , @xmath8 is the rest mass density of the dust fluid , and @xmath9 is an arbitrary function . from eq.([eq : rho - sol ] ) , the arbitrary function @xmath9 is regarded as the twice of a mass within the comoving radius @xmath4 .",
    "then eq.([eq : energy - eq ] ) is regarded as an energy equation for a dust fluid element labeled by @xmath4 and hence @xmath5 corresponds to the specific energy of it .    for simplicity ,",
    "hereafter we assume the self - similarity for this spacetime ; all the dimensionless variables are the functions of the self - similar variable @xmath10 only",
    ". then the arbitrary function @xmath9 is written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a positive dimensionless constant .",
    "the specific energy @xmath5 should vanish by this self - similar hypothesis .",
    "then the solution of eq.([eq : energy - eq ] ) is given in the form @xmath13 where using a freedom to re - scale the radial coordinate @xmath4 , we have chosen an arbitrary function associated to the temporal integration so that @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "the dust fluid element at @xmath4 forms the shell focusing singularity at @xmath16 .",
    "the exterior region is assumed to be vacuum and hence is described by the schwarzschild geometry by birkhoff s theorem . using the schwarzschild static chart ,",
    "the line element of the exterior region is written as @xmath17 where the function @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 the angular coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 are common to both the interior and exterior regions .",
    "the trajectory of the surface @xmath22 is a marginally bound timelike geodesic in the schwarzschild spacetime by continuity .",
    "thus the integration of the temporal component of geodesic equations and the normalization condition of the 4-velocity vector lead to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the proper time which agrees with the interior temporal coordinate , and to derive the second equation , we have used the fact that the dust sphere is collapsing .    from eqs.([eq : u0-sol ] ) and ( [ eq : u1-sol ] ) , the trajectory of the surface is determined by @xmath25 the above equation is easily integrated and we obtain @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant .",
    "by virtue of the spherical symmetry , it does not loose any generality to assume that the null geodesic is confined within the @xmath28 plane and hence we do so .",
    "then the tangent vector @xmath29 of the future directed outgoing null geodesic in the ltb spacetime is expressed in the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the affine parameter and @xmath32 is an integration constant which corresponds to the conserved angular momentum . without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath33 .",
    "we call a null geodesic of @xmath34 the _ radial _ one while a null geodesic of @xmath35 is called the _ non - radial _ one .",
    "@xmath36 should be larger than or equal to @xmath32 so that @xmath37 is positive and @xmath38 is real . in this article",
    ", we are interested in the null geodesics emanating from the central naked singularity ; we call those the _ singular null geodesics_.    instead of the affine parameter @xmath31 , we adopt the comoving radius @xmath4 to parameterize the null geodesic .",
    "then the geodesic equations become @xmath39 where we have introduced a new variable defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is some positive constant which will be fixed in the following discussion .",
    "as discussed by joshi and dwivedi@xcite , singular null geodesics should behave near the singularity as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is some positive constant . assuming this behavior , we search for asymptotic solutions of both the radial and non - radial singular null geodesics in the neighborhood of the central naked singularity .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the radial singular null geodesic have already been studied well by several researchers@xcite .",
    "however , we would like to again see it in detail since the knowledge about the radial singular null geodesics is useful for the analysis of non - radial singular null geodesics .    for radial null geodesics , eqs.([eq : r - equation ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : r - asymptotic ] ) lead to @xmath44 the above equation determines @xmath43 and @xmath41 . in order",
    "that the above equation has a positive root for @xmath43 , @xmath41 should be @xmath45 or unity .",
    "the solutions of @xmath46 correspond to null geodesics from the origin before the formation of central singularity while the solutions of @xmath47 are of our interest , i.e. , the singular null geodesics .",
    "to see this fact , we rewrite eq.([eq : r - solution ] ) in the form @xmath48 using the above equation and eq.([eq : r - asymptotic ] ) , we find that @xmath49 for @xmath50 along the null geodesic of @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the null geodesics of @xmath46 start from the regular center @xmath51 at @xmath52 and hence these are not singular null geodesics . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath47",
    ", @xmath24 approaches to zero for @xmath50 along the null geodesic .",
    "hence the null geodesics of @xmath47 emanate from the central singularity @xmath51 at @xmath15 .",
    "choosing @xmath47 , eq.([eq : w0-eq-1 ] ) leads to @xmath53 the radial singular null geodesics have to satisfy the above equation .",
    "since @xmath54 is positive , @xmath55 should hold .",
    "we can easily find that there is a maximum of @xmath56 at @xmath57 hence in order that a singular null geodesic exists , @xmath12 should be less than or equal to a critical value @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 we depict @xmath60 in fig.[fg : h - i ] . in this article , we will focus on the case in which @xmath12 is smaller than the critical value @xmath58 .",
    "then form fig.[fg : h - i ] , we can easily see that for a given value of @xmath12 , there are two positive real roots of eq.([eq : w0-eq-2 ] ) .",

    "this means that @xmath78 should be positive as long as @xmath77 does not vanish .",
    "the positivity of @xmath78 leads to the following inequality @xmath79 hence for non - vanishing @xmath77 , the smaller root @xmath80 of eq.([eq : w0-eq-2 ] ) has to be chosen ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the other root @xmath62 of eq.([eq : w0-eq-2 ] ) is larger than @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 is negative . for such singular null geodesics",
    ", @xmath77 has to vanish so that @xmath68 approaches to @xmath62 for @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 should be always equal to @xmath62 by eq.([eq : r - equation ] ) .",
    "this null geodesic is a generator of the cauchy horizon . substituting @xmath47 , @xmath34 and @xmath83 into eq.([eq : p - equation ] )",
    ", we can easily perform the integration and obtain the solution for @xmath69 on the cauchy horizon as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an integration constant and @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 , @xmath69 vanishes in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "let us consider non - radial singular null geodesics of @xmath89 for @xmath50 .",
    "the argument from eqs.([eq : w0-eq-1 ] ) to ( [ eq : w0-inequality ] ) is almost completely applicable to this case .",
    "however , because @xmath69 has to diverge for @xmath50 , @xmath78 should be positive .",
    "hence the smaller root @xmath80 of eq.([eq : w0-eq-2 ] ) must be chosen .",
    "the trajectory in the @xmath90-plane is determined by the equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the above equation becomes for @xmath50 as @xmath93 integrating the above equation , we find @xmath94 hence @xmath21 has a finite limit for @xmath50 .",
    "as discussed by nolan and mena@xcite , this result means that the singularity from which the non - radial null geodesics of @xmath80 emanate is foliated by 2-sphere in accordance with christodoulou s argument@xcite .      here , we investigate non - radial singular null geodesics with a finite limit of @xmath69 for @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath41 should be @xmath45 or unity . by the same reason as in the previous cases , we find that @xmath47 corresponds to the singular null geodesics , and hence we focus on it",

    "the angular frequency @xmath160 is the smallest , while it is the largest at the boundary @xmath291 .",

    "the singular null geodesic at @xmath290 in the limit of @xmath293 is the generator of the event horizon and hence suffers the infinite gravitational redshift . by virtue of this gravitational redshift of the central naked singularity",
