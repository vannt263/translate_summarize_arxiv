    "aperiodic x - ray variability is a general characteristic of xrbs and agn ( e.g. , van der klis 1994 ; vaughan et al .",
    "2003a ; mchardy et al .",
    "2004 ; uttley et al .",
    "the recent studies show that the linear rms - flux relation occurs in the x - ray light curves of xrbs and agn over a broad range of time - scales , then this linear rms - flux relation is offset on the flux axis , which suggests the light curves to include at least two components : one component with a linear rms - flux relation and another with a constant rms to flux ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ; gleissner et al .",
    "the fact of the same rms - flux relationship found in the light curves of xrbs and agn suggests that this behavior is intrinsic to the accreting systems , and in addition the similar variability properties occur , as well , in neutron star ( ns ) and black hole ( bh ) xrbs ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ; belloni et al .",
    "2002 ) with the different x - ray spectra ( e.g. , done & gierlinski 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , investigating the x - ray variability would provide a probe in tracing the clues of the x - ray emission mechanisms of compact accreting systems .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain the shape of power - spectral density function ( psd ) of xrbs , for example , the additive shot - noise models or flare models where the light curve is produced by a sum of shots or flares that trigger the avalanches of the smaller flares ( similar to the model of stern & svensson ( 1996 ) ) , which is caused by the magnetic reconnection in the corona ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "this variability model is often mentioned as a `` coronal flare '' model ( hereafter cf model , e.g. , uttley 2004 ) .",
    "the psd is a powerful tool to analyze the variability , however it confronts some limitations in distinguishing the models for aperiodic variability . while , these models seek to explain the observed psd shapes by the distribution of shot time - scales and shot profiles which can fit any noise process psd in theory ( see , e.g. , miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ; belloni & hasinger 1990 ; lochner et al . 1991",
    "; negoro et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "as indicated by uttley & mchardy ( 2001 ) , the linear rms - flux relation found in bh binary cyg x-1 and ns binary sax j1808.4 - 3658 could provide the strong constraints on models of variability , for example , the simple additive shot - noise or flare models can not provide the linear rms - flux relation on short time - scale .",
    "uttley ( 2004 ) demonstrates that the aperiodic variability showing the linear rms - flux relation in sax j1808.4 - 3658 is coupled to the 401 hz pulsation , implies this variability originates from the ns surface and not from the corona , which is most likely associated with the accretion flow .",
    "the `` propagating perturbation '' model ( pp model for short ) of lyubarskii ( 1997 ) is a promised one , which ascribes the variability to the variations in accretion rate occurring at different radii ( slow variations occurring at larger radii ) while the perturbation propagates inwards and modulates the energy release in the x - ray - emitting region and results in the x - ray light curve .",
    "besides successfully explaining the rms - flux relation , the pp model can also explain the spectral - timing properties of the variability ( kotov et al .",
    "2001 ; vaughan et al . 2003a ; mchardy et al .",
    "similar to the pp model , the exponential model of uttley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) can infer the linear rms - flux relation and a lognormal flux distribution , which is consistently associated with the observations .",
    "x - ray dips often occur in the x - ray light curves of xrbs , and are suggested to be due to the absorption by matter passing through the line of sight to the x - ray emitting region ( white et al .",
    "thus , the research on the dips will provide us some information in the x - ray emitting region ( e.g. , shirey et al .",
    "1999 ; asai et al .",
    "2000 ; church 2001 ) . in this paper , using _",
    "rxte _ data of cyg x-1 ,",
    "we study statistically the rms - flux relation over the frequency range 0.1 - 10 hz of the dips and nondip , respectively . in sect .",
    "2 , we introduce the observational data and the method of calculating rms . the obtained results on the rms - flux relation are described in sect .",
    "the discussions about the rms - flux relation , including its slope and intercept , and models of x - ray variability are given in sect .",
    "we acquire the public archival data from _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) observations of cyg x-1 , and choose the observations from april 15 of 1996 to march 22 of 1999 ( pca epoch 3 ) , which have the same channel - energy relationship .",
    "the observations of pca epoch 3 with the data modes sb_125us_0_13_2s , sb_250us_0_13_2s or sb_500us_0_13_2s are used .",
    "we extract the light curves of every obsid with the standard 2 mode over the energy bands of 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 24 kev , where the hardness ratio is defined as the count rate ratios between 13 - 24 kev and 2 - 5 kev .",
    "we find the obvious long term dips ( the duration of all the dips @xmath0 1000 s ) in the observations p10241 , p30158 and p30161 , while in the low state ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the p30161 contains many dips , so , which can be divided into two parts for analyzing .",
    "figures 1 - 4 show the light curves and hardness ratio of the observations containing long term dip , and in the bottom panels of these four figures ( hardness ratio ) the dips are indicated by the arrows .    [",

    "( 1997 ) study the rms - flux relations in the energy bands 0.7 - 4 kev and 4 - 10 kev of cyg x-1 with _ asca _ , and find that there are ( no ) dips over the 0.7 - 4 kev ( 4 - 10 kev ) energy band ( see fig.1 of bauci ' nska - church et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) .",
    "our results show that , for some observations , the dips exist in both 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 24 kev bands and the photons of the high energy band are also absorbed by the obscuring matter ( fig.1 - 4 ) , which are not consistent with the results of bauci ' nska - church et al .",
    "( 1997)who suggest that the x - ray emission region is not abscured in the high energy band .    the results from _ asca _",
    "show that the rms variability is linearly related with the flux in the 0.7 - 4 kev band , then the rms variability is constant with the flux in the 4 - 10 kev band . our results from _ rxte _ show that the rms variability is linearly related with the flux in both 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 24 kev bands although both _ asca _ and _ rxte _ observations are involved in the hard state of cyg x-1 .",
    "the count rates of nondip data with _",
    "asca _ are about 200 count s@xmath1 in the 0.7 - 4 kev band , which are lower than the count rates from _ rxte _ in the 2 - 5 kev band ( also see , fig . 1 - 4 ) .",
    "moreover , it is noticed that the count rates are as low as 60 count s@xmath1 in the 4 - 10 kev band with _",
    ", therefore the results by bauci ' nska - church et al .",
    "( 1997 ) may be not conclusive .",
    "the linear rms - flux relations are observed in both xrbs and agn , implying that the similar physical mechanisms work in these accreting systems .",
    "no doubt , the linear rms - flux relation provides the strong constraints on the models of the x - ray variability .",
    "uttley & mchardy ( 2001 ) argue that a linear rms - flux relation in xrbs and agn gets rid of the additive shot - noise models , since these models treat the shots on all time - scales to be independent each other and can not predict a linear rms - flux relation in a short time - scale . after analyzing the rms - flux relation of sax j1808.4 - 3658 , uttley ( 2004 )",
    "confirms that the variability could come from the accretion flow , not the accretion disk corona .",
    "in addition , the energy dependence characteristic of the variability disagrees with the conclusions of existing the extend corona ( maccarone et al . 2000 ; focke et al . 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , soc ( self - organized criticality in accretion flow ) is also ruled out because it can not produce the observed lognormal flux distribution ( uttley et al .",
    "uttley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) deduce that pp model seems to be a promising model at the present stage . in this model ,",
    "the perturbations are treated to be produced at different radii in the accretion flow , and these perturbations can propagate inwards without being suppressed and then the perturbations at different radii can couple together . as pointed out , what could fulfill the possibility is a geometrically thick accretion flow where the accretion time - scales are relatively short so that the variations can propagate to the inner regions of the accretion flow without being significantly damped ( manmoto et al .",
    "1996 ; churazov et al . 2001 ; arvalo & uttley 2006 ) .",
    "however , the origin of perturbation is not yet clear , although a variety of accretion instabilities could contribute to it ( frank et al .",
    "king et al . (",
    "2004 ) have shown that the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence can cause the accretion perturbations on the sufficiently long time - scales . in the pp model , the x - ray variability of low ( high ) energy band",
    "is produced mostly in the outside ( inside ) of the accretion flow ( lyubarskii 1997 ) .",
    "the phenomenological exponential model proposed by uttley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which is mainly consistent with the conclusions of pp model , could reproduce the variability properties of the observed data .",
    "our results show that the slope of the rms - flux relation decreases with the increase of the energy in the hard state of cyg x-1 ( also see , gleissner et al .",
    ". the pp model can provide an appropriate explanation : the photons of high energy band are produced in the inner accretion regime .",
    "the perturbations in the different outer radii of accretion flow propagate to the inner accretion flow and modulate the emission region , as a result , the amplitude of x - ray variability of high energy will increase .",
    "in fact , the perturbations from the different outer radii to the inner accretion flow could become stochastic in some extend .",
    "the increase of the stochastic component could weaken the variability of the inner x - ray emission region , which may result in the decrease of the rms variability in the high energy band .",
    "our results show that the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 decrease from the nondip to dip in energy band 2 - 5 kev ( see table 2 ) , suggesting the optical thick obscuring matter locate outside of the emission region .",
    "in general , it is believed that the dips of cyg x-1 are caused by the density enhancement in an inhomogeneous wind of the companion star or due to the partial obscuration of an extended x - ray emitting region by the optically thick `` clumps '' in the accretion flow ( feng & cui 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the reason for @xmath3 decreasing could be due to the absorption of the obscuring matter to the constant component .",
    "on the other hand , the obscuring matter seems to add a little stochastic modulation to the intrinsic light curves , which could make the light curves a bit stochastic and then induce the decrease of @xmath2 .",
    "the intercept @xmath3 of the linear rms - flux relation sometimes is negative ( also see , gleissner et al .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 can not simply represent a constant component to the light curve , but can represent a component with the constant rms .",
    "the slope @xmath2 corresponds to an increase in the fractional rms of the linear rms - flux component of the light curve . for convenience ,",
    "equivalently , the equation @xmath4 can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is positive whenever @xmath7 , predicting @xmath8 for @xmath9 , which is unphysical .",
    "we adopt the assumption that @xmath10 for @xmath11 , which suggests that , when @xmath12 , other variability process that does not obey the linear rms - flux relationship would be important and make @xmath10 when @xmath13 ( also see , gleissner et al .",
    "2004 ) . when @xmath14 is from @xmath15 to a certain flux , suggesting that the value of @xmath2 increase with the flux .",
    "when @xmath14 is larger than a certain flux , the value of @xmath2 is up to a constant , or the rms - flux becomes linear .",
    "the pp model confirms that the x - ray variations produce at the different radii in the accretion flow , with the slower variations produced at larger radii .",
    "the accretion variations can then propagate to the small radii , then the variations at different radii , i.e. , different time - scales , can couple together . in the emission region of high energy , the variations originate from the perturbations propagated from the different outer radii of accretion flow , and they couple with each other , which induces the increase of the stochastic component and the decrease of rms variability .",
    "however , the emission region of low energy is only modulated by the outermost variations , resulting in that the amplitude of variability is increasing with flux .",
    "therefore , the slope of the high energy band is smaller that that of the low energy band .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
