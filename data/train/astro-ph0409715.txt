    "after the discovery of the association of sn 2003dh with grb 030329 ( stanek , 2003 ; hjorth , 2003 ) , and of sn 1998bw with 980425 , it has been widely accepted that classical , cosmological grbs arise from the simultaneous collapse of a sn to form a collapsar ( woosley 1994 ) .",
    "further evidence comes from the third nearby burst , grb 031203 , which also has been seen to be closely associated with a type ic sn ( tagliaferri , 2004 ; malesani , 2004 ) .",
    "this model appears plausible for all long grbs , even the distant ones , in the light of the similarity between these two objects and grb 011121/sn2001ke ( bloom et al .",
    ", 2002 ; garnavich et al .",
    "2003 ) , an object located at @xmath4 . still , the fact that only some bursts afterglows display the re  bumps now associated with the emergence of the optical contribution due to the underlying sn beckons the question of exactly which fraction of all grbs ( within the detectability range of sn rebumps , say @xmath5 ) are in fact associated with simultaneous sne .",
    "in order to tackle this problem , we study whether the detection of grb 980425 , 030329 and 031203 , the only ones unequivocally associated with a type ic sn of extreme properties within a very small distance ( z=0.17 ) from us , is a statistical anomaly , for the luminosity functions that are consistent with the grb logn - logs distribution .",
    "if the three low  redshift grbs ( 980425 , 030329 and 031203 ) are really typical of the global grb population , then their discovery within the current time and sky coverage , must be consistent with the local grb explosion rate as deduced from the very large grb samples made available by batse .",
    "a simple computation of the expected number of events within @xmath0 ( the redshift of grb 030329 ) shows that this is not the case .",
    "the volume out to @xmath0 , in a @xmath6 cosmology with @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , is @xmath9 gpc@xmath10 .",
    "association of a grb with a sn requires an accurate position , and thus only bursts revealed by the bepposax wfc cameras , or hete2 wxm telescopes , can be used .",
    "inclusion of integral would only make matters slightly worse .",
    "these two x  ray telescopes monitor @xmath11 and @xmath12 steradians respectively ( band , 2002 ) .",
    "the total effective operation times for bepposax and hete2 are generously estimated as @xmath13 yr and @xmath14 yr ( l. piro , private communication ) .",
    "if we call @xmath15 the observed local rate of grbs , we find that the total expected number of grbs located inside @xmath0 is @xmath16 the probability of observing three bursts , assuming poisson statistics , is then @xmath17 .",
    "the major uncertainty in the above equation concerns @xmath15 , which takes on different values depending upon exactly which data property is fitted ( @xmath18 , or the @xmath19 relationship for batse data ) . for the local observed rate , porciani and madau ( 2001 ) consider three different star formation rates , and correspondingly find three values for @xmath15 , between @xmath20 and @xmath21 bursts gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 ( having converted their results to h@xmath23 = 71 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "schmidt ( 2001 ) considers the same star formation rates , but fits different quantities , to obtain @xmath24 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 .",
    "perna , frail and sari ( 2003 ) find @xmath25 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 , while guetta , piran and waxman ( 2003 ) find @xmath26 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 . in the next section ,",
    "we will repeat the analysis of guetta ( 2003 ) with a more updated sample , to obtain @xmath27 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 . with this value ,",
    "the probability of a triple event would be @xmath28 .",
    "the hypothesis that the three nearby bursts , 980425 , 030329 and 031203 , belong to the same group as the classical batse bursts , would thus be rejected with fairly high confidence .    however , this is not correct .",
    "the local rate discussed above has been derived by all authors under the hypothesis that classical bursts exceed by far the luminosity of grb 980425 and they also exceed that of grb 031203 ( i.e. they considered a minimum luminosity for the lf @xmath29 erg / sec , which from now on we will assume to define the minimum luminosity for the classical population ) . therefore , the derived probabilities are not self - consistent .",
    "an unified picture can only be obtained with a lf that includes all luminosities down to that of grb 980425 , and at the same time yields high probability of observing the three low-@xmath2 events .",
    "this is what we will achieve in  4 , after setting up the formalism and recomputing ( for the more updated sample ) the local rate for the classical population in  3 .",
    "we consider all 2204 grbs of the gusbad catalog which contains all the long grbs ( @xmath30sec ) ( kouveliotou et al",
    ". , 1993 ) , detected while the batse onboard trigger ( paciesas et al . 1999 ) was set for 5.5 @xmath31 over background ( resolution of 1024 ms ) in at least two detectors , in the energy range 50 - 300 kev .",
    "we estimate @xmath32 for each burst ( where @xmath33 is the count rate in the second brightest illuminated detector and @xmath34 is the minimum detectable rate ) and find @xmath35 .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of the `` classical '' population of long - duration grbs may be represented as a power law with lower and upper limits , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the local lf of grb peak luminosities @xmath38 , defined as the co - moving space density of grbs in the interval @xmath39 to @xmath40 is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a normalization constant .",
    "we stress that this lf is the  isotropic - equivalent \" lf , it does not include the effects of beaming .",
    "we assume that grbs trace the star - formation history , and adopt the recent sfr derived by rowan - robinson ( 1999 ; rr - sfr ) ; this can be fitted with the expression @xmath43 the modeling procedure involves the derivation of the peak flux p(l , z ) of a grb of peak luminosity l observed at redshift z : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bolometric luminosity distance and @xmath46 is the spectral energy distribution integrated between @xmath47 kev and @xmath48 kev .",
    "schmidt ( 2001 ) finds that the median value of the spectral photon index in the 50 - 300kev band for long bursts grbs is -1.6 .",
    "we use this value for our analysis to include the k - correction",
    ".    objects with luminosity @xmath38 observed by batse with a flux limit @xmath49 are detectable to a maximum redshift @xmath50 that can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ peak ] ) .",
    "we consider an average limiting flux @xmath51 ph @xmath52s@xmath8 taken from the batse catalog .",
    "the number of bursts with a peak flux @xmath53 is given by : @xmath54 where the factor @xmath55 accounts for cosmological time dilation and @xmath56 is the comoving volume element .    to be consistent with previous calculations ,",
    "we take the low luminosity cut - off @xmath57 erg s@xmath8 , while the high luminosity , @xmath58 erg s@xmath8 , is taken on the order of the maximum luminosity detected until the time of writing ( bloom et al . 2003 ) . the slope @xmath59 of the lf is constrained by fitting the model with the observed peak flux distribution with a non - linear levemberg - marquart minimum @xmath60 method . to avoid problems with error correlation in a cumulative distribution like @xmath61",
    "propagate in an unknown way , we use the differential distributions @xmath62 for this analysis .",
    "we find that the best fit is given for @xmath63 ; the p - value of the fit is @xmath64 ( see fig.1 upper panel ) . both @xmath59 and the normalization value",
    "are somewhat insensitive to the choice of @xmath65 below a value @xmath66 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "this is mainly because grbs with very low luminosity appear above the sensitivity limit of @xmath67 photons @xmath52 s@xmath8 in a very small volume around the observer .    to obtain the observed local rate of grbs per unit volume , @xmath15",
    ", we need to estimate the effective full - sky coverage of our grb sample .",
    "the gusbad catalog represents 3.185 years of batse full sky coverage implying a rate of 692 grb per year . using our lf we find @xmath68gpc@xmath22yr@xmath8 .",
    "we are thus left with the question of how to include grb 980425 and grb 031203 within our analysis .",
    "it is quite possible that these bursts belong to a different , local population of bursts , as occasionally claimed by some authors for grb 980425 ( bloom et al .",
    "still , there are at least two arguments suggesting that 980425 is just a normal burst seen sideways ( nakamura 1998 ; eichler & levinson 1999 ; woosley , eastman & schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "one is the exceptional similarity of the two underlying sne in 980425 and 030329 , within a class ( that of extreme type ic sne ) known instead for its lack of common patterns .",
    "the other is that grb 021211 ( della valle , 2003 ) , and all bursts with the so  called optical rebumps are likely associated also to sn .",
    "for this reason , we consider a lf model which includes grbs seen sideways .",
    "we follow the analogy with beamed agns , according to which ( urry and shafer 1984 ) the total lf is simply a broken power  law , agreeing , at the bright end , with the lf of the objects seen face  on .",
    "we thus take : @xmath69 we impose here @xmath70 , @xmath71 erg s@xmath8 and @xmath36 to be the border value between grbs seen sideways ( weak bursts ) and the ones seen face  on ( classical bursts ) .",
    "we choose somewhat arbitrarily @xmath57 erg s@xmath8 , and fit the same data as in the previous section with @xmath59 and @xmath72 as free parameters .",
    "note that it has been proposed that x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are simply grbs viewed off - axis .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then xrfs could be included in our analysis in the lower part of the lf broken power law ( recalling that xrfs are generally underluminous compared to grbs ) .",
    "the best  fit ( @xmath73 and p - value @xmath74 ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( lower panel ) . with this lf ,",
    "the total local rate of events , down to the lowest luminosity ( that of 980425 ) is now much higher , @xmath75 gpc@xmath22yr@xmath8 , while the rate for @xmath76 remains unaffected . using eq(1 ) , we find that the expected number of events within @xmath0 , and of luminosity even as low as grb 980425 , is @xmath77 , which is clearly highly compatible with the current observation of 3 events .",
    "a strong radio emission is expected from bursts seen sideways at @xmath78 1 yr delay ( waxman 2004ab , livio & waxman 2000 , see also waxman 2004a , b and reference within ) as the jet decelerates to sub - relativistic speed and its emission approaches isotropy .",
    "however no late - time rebrightening was detected for either grb 980425 or grb 031203 ( sodeberg , frail & wieringa 2004 ; sodeberg et al . 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "these results suggest that neither grb 980425 nor grb 031203 were off - axis events , and instead were intrinsically sub - energetic grbs .",
    "therefore we also consider the possibility that both grb 980425 and grb 031203 might have intrinsically low luminosity and all grbs are seen on axis .",
    "the lf can still have an _ intrinsic _ break for some ( unknown ) reason , and therefore it can still be represented by eq.([broken ] ) ( as in schmidt 2001 ) . in this case we can leave @xmath65 as a free parameter in our fit and look for the best fit parameters @xmath79 . the results ( @xmath80 erg s@xmath8 and p - value @xmath81 ) are shown in fig",
    ". 1 lower panel . with this",
    "lf the total local rate of events is @xmath82 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 .",
    "however , if all grbs are seen on axis , then there is no natural explanation for the break in the lf . indeed a single power law lf with @xmath70 , @xmath71 erg s@xmath8 could be rapresentative of these bursts . however in this case we get a very high local rate , @xmath83 gpc@xmath22 yr@xmath8 , which would predict about 24 events within the @xmath0 volume ( again using eq.1 ) . the probability of having only 3 occurrences is @xmath84 , which makes this scenario very unlikely .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a broken powerlaw for the luminosity function is highly preferred to a single powerlaw , if the three low-@xmath2 events do belong to the same class as the classical ones .",
    "also note that the rate for the single powerlaw would yield about 400 gem ( galactic events per million years ) , implying an implausibly large number of grb remnants ( loeb & perna 1998 ; efremov et al . 1998 ) at any given time .",
    "our model also allows us to compute the probability of finding one object ( grb 980425 ) as close as @xmath85 , which would be of course prohibitively small if we were to apply to this burst the statistics for classical grbs discussed in  3 . for our best - fit powerlaw model",
    ", we find that the probablity of bursts as luminous as grb 980425 within the volume accessible to bepposax and heteii , is @xmath86 , small but still not completely ruled out .",
    "for the detection threshold of swift ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , this rate would be 0.05 , while that of all bursts with @xmath87 is @xmath88 for a 2-yr observation period .",
    "we have shown in this _ letter _ that the presence of three nearby grbs does not pose a problem for the current view ( according to which both distant and nearby bursts belong to the same class ) , if we modify the lf to include an extension to luminosities as low as that of grb 980425 .",
    "we did this by means of a _ minimum impact _ extension , , by assuming , in complete analogy with beamed agns , that the lf of the bursts is a broken power ",
    "law , with the bright  end distribution equal to what we derived when we neglected the presence of faint , sideways bursts . as a by  product",
    ", we showed that this yields a non  negligible probability for the detection of grb 980425like event , which is also a new result .",
    "how could this picture change ?",
    "some authors have insisted that it is not possible to throw grb 980425 in the same cage as classical grbs , because of its unique properties in the radio band . within our model ,",
    "the local rate of nearby bright bursts ( @xmath89 erg s@xmath8 ) observable by heteii within @xmath0 is @xmath90 yr@xmath8 .",
    "this implies that we ought to observe the next such event @xmath91 yr from now .",
    "should we see one significantly earlier than that then the argument suggesting a similarity between the distant , classical bursts and the nearby ones would have to be reassessed .      band , l. 2002 , apj 572 , l45 .",
