    "the study of antibaryon  nucleus interactions has attracted increasing interest in recent years at the prospect of future experiments at the fair facility @xcite . in particular ,",
    "much attention has been devoted to the antiproton ",
    "nucleus interaction and the possibility of formation of @xmath1nucleus bound states @xcite . exploring the @xmath1nucleus interaction could provide valuable information about the behavior of the antiproton in the nuclear medium as well as nuclear dynamics .",
    "one of the motivations for our study of @xmath1nucleus bound states is the conjecture that the considerable suppression of the phase space for the @xmath1 annihilation products in the nuclear medium could lead to relatively long living @xmath1 inside the nucleus @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we report on our recent fully self - consistent calculations of antibaryon  nucleus bound states within the relativistic mean - field model @xcite .",
    "the behavior of an antibaryon in the nuclear medium and the dynamical effects caused by the presence of the antibaryon in the nucleus were studied for several selected nuclei . special attention was devoted to the @xmath1nucleus interaction including @xmath1 absorption in the nucleus .    in section 2",
    ", a brief description of the underlying model is given .",
    "few representative results of our calculations are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "in the present work , antibaryon  nucleus bound states are studied within the framework of the rmf approach applied to a system of nucleons and one antibaryon ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the interaction among ( anti)baryons is mediated by the exchange of the scalar ( @xmath5 ) and vector ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) meson fields , and the massless photon field @xmath8 .",
    "the standard lagrangian density @xmath9 for nucleonic sector is extended by the lagrangian density @xmath10 describing the antibaryon interaction with the nuclear medium ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the variational principle yields the equations of motion for the hadron fields involved .",
    "the dirac equations for nucleons and antibaryon read : @xmath11\\psi_j^{\\alpha}=\\epsilon_j^{\\alpha } \\psi_j^{\\alpha } ,   \\quad j = n,\\bar{b}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the scalar and vector potentials . here",
    ", @xmath13 denotes single particle states , @xmath14 stands for ( anti)baryon masses and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are ( anti)baryon coupling constants to corresponding fields .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 induces additional source terms in the klein ",
    "gordon equations for the meson fields : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scalar , vector , isovector and charge densities , respectively , and @xmath20 are the masses of considered mesons .",
    "the system of coupled dirac and klein  gordon equations represents a self - consistent problem which is to be solved by iterative procedure .",
    "the values of the nucleon  meson coupling constants and meson masses were adopted from the nonlinear rmf model tm1(2 ) @xcite for heavy ( light ) nuclei .",
    "we used also the density  dependent model tw99 @xcite in which the couplings are a function of the baryon density .",
    "the hyperon  meson coupling constants for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 fields are obtained using su(6 ) symmetry relations .",
    "the coupling constants for the @xmath5 field are constrained by available experimental data  @xmath23 hypernuclei @xcite , @xmath24 atoms @xcite , and @xmath25 production in @xmath26 reaction @xcite .    in the rmf approach",
    ", the nuclear ground state is well described by the attractive scalar potential @xmath27  mev and by the repulsive vector potential @xmath28  mev .",
    "the resulting central potential acting on a nucleon in a nucleus is then approximately @xmath29  mev deep .",
    "the @xmath0nucleus interaction is constructed from the @xmath30nucleus interaction with the help of the g - parity transformation : the vector potential generated by the @xmath21 meson exchange thus changes its sign and becomes attractive . as a consequence",
    ", the total potential acting on a @xmath0 will be strongly attractive .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1nuclear potential would be @xmath31  mev deep .",
    "however , the g - parity transformation should be regarded as a mere starting point to determine the @xmath0meson coupling constants .",
    "various many - body effects , as well as the presence of strong annihilation channels could cause significant deviations from the g - parity values in the nuclear medium . indeed , the available experimental data from @xmath1 atoms @xcite and @xmath1 scattering off nuclei @xcite suggest that the depth of the real part of the @xmath1nucleus potential is in the range @xmath32  mev in the nuclear interior .",
    "therefore , we introduce a scaling factor @xmath33 for the antibaryon  meson coupling constants which are in the following relation to the baryon ",
    "meson couplings : @xmath34    the annihilation of an antibaryon inside the nuclear medium is an inseparable part of any realistic description of the @xmath0nucleus interaction . in our calculations , only the @xmath1 absorption in the nucleus has been considered so far . since the rmf model does not address directly the absorption of the @xmath1 in the nucleus we adopted the imaginary part of the optical potential in a ` @xmath35 ' form from optical model phenomenology @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath1nucleus reduced mass . while the density @xmath22 was treated as a dynamical quantity determined within the rmf model , the parameter @xmath38 was constrained by fits to @xmath1-atomic data @xcite .",
    "the global fits to the @xmath1-atomic data give a single value for the imaginary part of @xmath38 , im@xmath39 fm for all nuclei considered .",
    "the energy available for the @xmath1 annihilation in the nuclear medium is usually expressed as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the @xmath1 and nucleon binding energy , respectively .",
    "therefore , the phase space available for the annihilation products is considerably suppressed for the deeply bound antiproton .",

    "@xmath43 were evaluated with the help of monte carlo simulation tool pluto @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig . : sf ] , we present the phase space suppression factors as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath44 for considered annihilation channels . as the energy @xmath44 decreases many channels become significantly suppressed or even closed which could lead to much longer lifetime of @xmath1 in a nucleus .",
    "we applied the formalism introduced in the previous section to self - consistent calculations of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 bound states in selected nuclei across the periodic table .",
    "first , we did not consider absorption of an antibaryon in a nucleus .",
    "our calculations within the tm model confirmed substantial polarization of the nuclear core caused by the antibaryon embedded in the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon single particle energies are significantly affected by the presence of @xmath0 and the total binding energies increase considerably , as well .",
    "the nucleon densities in @xmath1 nuclei reach @xmath49 times the nuclear matter density .",
    "the rmf models with constant couplings do not have to describe correctly the properties of nuclear matter when extrapolated to such high densities .",
    "therefore , we performed calculations of @xmath1 nuclei within the density  dependent model tw99 , as well .",
    "we obtained very similar results as for the tm model and thus confirmed only small model dependence of our calculations .",
    "figure [ fig . : potencialy ] shows the total potential acting on an extra baryon ( a ) and on an extra antibaryon ( b ) in @xmath50 state in @xmath51o , calculated dynamically in the tm2 model .",
    "the scaling parameter is chosen to be @xmath52 as this value gives the @xmath1 potential comparable with the available experimental data .",
    "we assume the same scaling parameter also for antihyperons , since there is no reliable experimental information on the in - medium antihyperon potentials .",
    "the potentials acting on antibaryons are fairly deep in the central region of the nucleus in contrast to the baryon potentials ( notice that the potential for @xmath53 is even repulsive while the potential for @xmath54 is strongly attractive ) .",
    "such strongly attractive potentials yield deeply bound states of antibaryons in atomic nuclei .",

    "the @xmath56 coupling constants are scaled by factor @xmath57 .",
    "the binding energy of @xmath55 is increasing with the number of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath56 binding energy follows the opposite trend and in pb it is even less bound than @xmath55 .",
    "this can be explained by enhanced coulomb repulsion felt by @xmath56 in heavier nuclei .",
    "we performed calculations of @xmath1 nuclei using a complex potential describing the @xmath1 annihilation in the nuclear medium .",
    "the results of static as well as dynamical calculations with the real potential , complex potential , and complex potential with the suppression factors @xmath43 for @xmath1 bound in @xmath51o are presented in table [ tab .",
    ": hodnoty ] .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath1meson coupling constants is chosen to be @xmath57 .",
    "the static calculations , which do not account for the core polarization effects , give approximately the same values of the @xmath1 single particle energy for all three cases .",
    "the single particle energies calculated dynamically are larger , which indicates that the polarization of the core nucleus is significant ( even if the @xmath1 absorption is taken into account ) . when the effect of the phase space suppression is considered the @xmath1 annihilation width is substantially suppressed ( compare @xmath58  mev vs. @xmath59  mev in the last row of table [ tab . :",
    "hodnoty ] ) . however , the @xmath1 width is still considerable for relevant @xmath1 potentials consistent with the @xmath1 data .",

    "therefore , the momentum dependent term in mandelstam variable @xmath62 is non - negligible in contrast to two body frame @xcite .",
    "our self - consistent evaluation of @xmath44 by considering the momenta of annihilating partners leads to an additional downward energy shift . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath1 width in @xmath51o@xmath63 is reduced by additional @xmath64  mev .",
    "we conclude that even after taking into account the phase space suppression corresponding to self - consistent treatment of @xmath44 including the @xmath1 and @xmath65 momenta , the @xmath1 annihilation widths in nuclei remain sizeable .",
