    "nonclassical properties of radiation fields have been of great interest both from a theoretical and experimental point of view@xcite .",
    "nonclassical states play an important role in quantum - optical settings since they are a useful resource for implementing quantum information and communication protocols , examples include entanglement generation@xcite , and superactivation of quantum capacity of quantum channels@xcite .",
    "much effort has also been devoted to various experimental aspects of nonclassical states @xcite .",
    "practically relevant examples of nonclassical states include squeezed coherent states , fock states , anti - bunched states , noon states , cat states , to mention a few .",
    "a significant effort has been directed to the detection of nonclassicality of states @xcite .",
    "apart from the qualitative assessment of nonclassicality of states , various measures of nonclassicality have also been proposed and studied in literature@xcite .",
    "analogous to the characterization of nonclassicality of states it is useful to assess the qualitative and quantitative nonclassical properties of quantum processes .",
    "one such approach was presented by rahimi - keshari et al .",
    "@xcite where the authors define a classical channel as one that maps input coherent states to classical states and nonclassical if at least one input coherent state is mapped to a nonclassical state .    in this article",
    "we take a different viewpoint where the emphasis is on the output states of a channel .",
    "the physical motivation behind this approach is the usefulness of a quantum channel in a quantum information protocol .",
    "if the protocol depends on resources of the nonclassical type , then a channel which outputs only classical states could be rendered redundant .",
    "the same is also true if one is interested in nonclassicality benchmarks for quantum sources .",
    "hence , a systematic approach to demarcate those channels that output only classical states and those that do not serves to be useful .",
    "another motivation for the emphasis on the output states of a channel stems from the mathematical notion of distance between quantum channels which is computed using induced norms on the space of quantum channels .",
    "a natural way to construct a distance measure between two quantum processes is to compute a distance ( defined on the set of density operators ) between output states of the two channels with an optimization over the input state space [ or for example between the output states of the two channels tensored with the identity channel as in the case of the diamond norm ] @xcite .",
    "an important class of channels with the property that they output only classical states irrespective of the input are known as nonclassicality breaking channels .",
    "we wish to highlight that these channels are single - party notions since nonclassicality of states is also a single - party notion ( and not like standard correlations that require at least one other system for their definitions ) . for the useful class of bosonic gaussian channels , the structure and properties of those that are nonclassicality breaking",
    "have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we deem that a channel is classical if its outputs are always classical , i.e. , the channel is nonclassicality breaking , and nonclassical otherwise . in other words",
    ", we base the notion of nonclassicality of a channel on what we call process output nonclassicality .",
    "it is within this framework that we define a measure of nonclassicality for quantum - optical channels .",
    "noise effects are inevitable in any realistic implementation of quantum information tasks and in general degrades nonclassicality@xcite .",
    "numerous manifestations of noise in quantum information protocols have previously been studied@xcite .",
    "it is the effect of noise on the nonclassical characteristics of a quantum system ( both on states and output states of channels ) that we exploit to define a measure of nonclassicality .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our notion of classical and nonclassical channels and compare it with the approach of rahimi - keshari et al . in section iii",
    "we introduce a measure of nonclassicality for multimode states which we call as the nonclassicality depth . in section",
    "iv we extend the framework of sec .",
    "iii to define a meaningful notion of nonclassicality depth for multimode channels .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "in this section we introduce a demarcation of processes into classical and nonclassical ones based on the output characteristics of the process which we call as process output nonclassicality .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the notion of nonclassicality of states of continuous - variable systems .",
    "the division between classical and nonclassical states of continuous - variable systems manifests itself most transparently in quantum optics . the pioneering work of glauber@xcite and sudarshan@xcite laid the foundation for the phase - space description of classical and nonclassical states of light .",
    "any state @xmath0 can be described in terms of its glauber - sudarshan diagonal ` weight ' function @xmath1@xcite : @xmath2 then @xmath0 is said to be classical if its associated @xmath1 function is everywhere non - negative over the phase - space @xmath3 , else it is said to be nonclassical . in other words ,",
    "a classical state is a convex mixture of coherent states , and coherent states are the most elementary of quantum states exhibiting classical behaviour@xcite .",
    "analogously , there is a divide at the level of quantum processes between those that output only classical states and those that output at least one nonclassical state , in other words , between channels that are nonclassicality breaking and those that are not . recall that a channel @xmath4 is said to be nonclassicality breaking if @xcite @xmath5 \\text { is classical } \\forall ~ { \\hat{\\rho } _ { } } \\in \\text { state space}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure and properties of single - mode and multimode nonclassicality breaking bosonic gaussian channels were studied in refs.@xcite and ref.@xcite respectively .",
    "we wish to emphasize that nonclassicality breaking channels form a convex subset of the set of all channels just as classical states form a convex subset of the set of all states .",
    "_ process output nonclassicality_. as motivated in the introduction , our approach to defining classical and nonclassical channels will lay emphasis on the output states of a channel .",
    "we deem a channel to be classical if it outputs only classical states irrespective of the input , i.e. if the channel is nonclassicality breaking and this is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . based on this approach",
    ", a nonclassical channel will be one for which there is at least one input state for which the corresponding output state is nonclassical .",
    "further , for the case of bosonic gaussian channels , we have a complete characterization of classical ( nonclassicality breaking ) channels @xcite that we will use later .",
    "we now compare our approach to classical channels with that presented in the work by rahimi - keshari et al.@xcite .",
    "there the authors introduced a notion of nonclassicality for a quantum process as the following :    _ definition _ @xcite .",
    "a quantum process is nonclassical if it transforms an input coherent state to a nonclassical state .",
    "further , in this framework , a classical process is one that maps input coherent states ( and also classical states ) to classical states .",
    "we note that their definition and subsequent discussion on the demarcation of processes into classical and nonclassical ones relies on the action of the channel on the set of coherent states .",
    "examples of classical processes include all passive canonical transformations ( that includes in particular the identity channel ) , photon subtraction , and the set of all nonclassicality breaking channels as to be explained below .    as mentioned in the previous subsection , we take an approach in which the division of channels into classical and nonclassical ones depends on restrictions only on the output space for all inputs .",
    "we call the method of rahimi - keshari et al . as quantum process nonclassicality ( qpn ) and",
    "we call our approach as process output nonclassicality .",
    "we compare the two approaches in table .",
    "[ table2 ] .",
    "we see that in both the cases the set of channels which are classical forms a convex subset of the set of all channels .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the main take - away from this computation of nonclassicality depth , as mentioned in table[table1 ] , is its reflection on the nonclassicality of states at the output of these channels . for the amplifier channel there",
    "exists at least one output which is maximally nonclassical irrespective of the channel parameter @xmath6 , for the attenuator channel the output with the maximum nonclassicality depth has nonclassicality depth which is monotonically increasing with the channel parameter @xmath6 reaching the maximum value 2 for @xmath7 , and finally , both the phase - conjugation and the singular channel always only produce classical states , in other words , they are nonclassicality breaking .",
    "so we see how the nonclassicality depth of channels reflects in the nonclassical character of its output states .",
    "we wish to highlight that for the case of single - mode bosonic gaussian channels we skipped the explicit optimization procedure and instead used the criterion for nonclassicality breaking@xcite for these channels which is known through other phase - space techniques .",
    "also the nonclassicality depths for the noisy versions of these single - mode bgcs can also be evaluated in a similar way .",
    "we explain this directly for the multimode case that we consider next .",
    "let us consider an @xmath8-mode bosonic gaussian channel @xmath9 described by the matrix pair @xmath10 , which satisfies the complete positivity condition@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the characteristic matrix associated with the matrix pair @xmath10@xcite , and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the antisymmetric pauli matrix , is the symplectic metric for an @xmath8-mode system .    to obtain the nonclassicality depth , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ opde ] , we need to find the minimum @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is nonclassicality breaking .",
    "we recollect that for bosonic gaussian channels the noise model of eq .",
    "simply reflects as an additive noise at the level of the @xmath17 matrix that represents the channel .",
    "so for computing the nonclassicality depth we resort to a criterion derived recently in ref.@xcite that tells us when a given bosonic gaussian channel @xmath9 is nonclassicality breaking : @xmath18 so we need to find the minimal @xmath15 such that @xmath19 by inspection we see that @xmath20 & = { \\rm max } \\left(0 , 1-x \\right),\\nonumber \\\\ x & = \\text { smallest eigenvalue of } \\mathcal{v}(x , y ) , \\label{e14 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] denotes the nonclassicality depth of the bosonic gaussian channel corresponding to the matrix pair @xmath10 .",
    "we wish to note that unlike the case of gaussian states , the nonclassicality depth of general multimode bosonic gaussian channels can have any value in the range of @xmath22 ( eq . ) , as demonstrated for the single - mode case in table i.    we can follow a similar procedure for bosonic gaussian channels that are quantum - limited . let @xmath23 denote a minimal noise matrix satisfying eq . for a given @xmath24 .",
    "the bosonic gaussian channel corresponding to the matrix pair @xmath25 is known as a quantum - limited channel .",
    "then we can simply replace @xmath17 by @xmath23 in eq . and then compute the corresponding nonclassicality depth .",
    "we make a simple observation that for a given @xmath24 @xmath20 \\leq \\zeta[\\phi(x , y_{\\rm ql})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the channel analogue of eq ..    however , if one is interested in the minimal noise channels whose action on a given channel renders it nonclassicality breaking , then one should evaluate the minimal elements of the set of noise matrices @xmath26 which satisfy @xmath27    in passing we note that a byproduct of the nonclassicality depth in eq .",
    "is that it provides upper bounds for nonclassicality depths of multimode nongaussian states which are possible outputs of the bosonic gaussian channel corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "we have presented a framework for studying the qualitative and quantitative nonclassical characteristics of a quantum channel .",
    "our approach relies on the notion of process output nonclassicality .",
    "we deemed channels that output only classical states ( i.e. , the set of nonclassicality breaking channels ) as classical channels .",
    "then any channel that outputs even a single nonclassical state is a nonclassical channel in our framework .",
    "we compared our approach with the one introduced by rahimi - keshari et al .",
    "( qpn framework ) where the authors proposed a notion of nonclassicality of channels based on their action on input coherent states .",
    "we then listed the various similarities and differences between the qpn framework and our framework in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the condition imposed on the notion of classical channels in our framework is stronger than the one in the qpn framework .",
    "a main difference was noted for the case of quantum capacity of bosonic gaussian channels that are classical in the two approaches , namely , that while it can be arbitrary in the qpn framework ( as can be seen for the identity channel ) , in our case it is strictly zero .",
    "once we established the qualitative part of assessing the nonclassical characteristics of a quantum channel , we introduced a nonclassicality measure for channels .",
    "we achieved this by first constructing a unified approach to quantify the nonclassicality depth of states ( channels ) based on the robustness of nonclassicality of states ( output states of the channel ) against gaussian noise for which it is rendered classical ( nonclassicality breaking ) .",
    "the measure is faithful , bounded , and has the right symmetry properties .",
    "the method was inspired by lee s prescription @xcite which we generalized for both the single - mode and multimode case , and by suitable extension to multimode channels .",
    "we then computed the nonclassicality depth of all multimode gaussian states and channels .",
    "our nonclassicality depth @xmath28 $ ] provides a quantitative characterization of the tolerance of a general quantum channel to the additive gaussian noise before it is rendered nonclassicality breaking .",
    "this is relevant from an experimental point of view since nonclassicality is a useful resource for implementation of many quantum information protocols and noise is inevitable in any realistic setting .",
    "we believe that the tools and techniques presented here could have connections to various aspects of continuous - variable systems like quantum process tomography @xcite and also for constructing nonclassicality benchmarks for quantum sources .",
    "finally , we wish to add that other measures of nonclassicality that have been mentioned in the introduction can be used to define suitable measures of process nonclassicality following the methods outlined here .",
