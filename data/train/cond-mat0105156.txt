    "are two - dimensional ( 2d ) conductors of mesoscopic size .",
    "nowadays there exists widely established opinion ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) that dynamic properties of pure - in - bulk quantum wires , in particular two - dimensional , are largely determined by scattering the electrons from randomly rough side boundaries of the conductor .",
    "this scattering mechanism is proven to be responsible for both relaxation processes in multi - mode conductors @xcite and for non - dissipative ( anderson ) localization of conduction electrons in narrow single - mode wires @xcite .    in studying the electron transport in 2d",
    "surface - corrugated systems two main problems are especially highlighted .",
    "one of them is relevant to adequate description of the electron scattering from statistically rough surfaces .",
    "the other , dynamic , problem is pertinent to proper consideration of the interference of multiply scattered quantum waves , which is essential for describing within the framework of a perturbation theory the effects resulting from non - dissipative localization of the electron states .    to resolve the first problem and make an adequate comparison with experimental data one needs a theory which relates transport properties of the conduction electrons to the shape of bounding surfaces of the conductor . since in random - inhomogeneous 2d",
    "wires fluctuations of both of the side boundaries can be considered as either mutually independent or correlative , subject to the preparation technology , it is important to trace the relation between the kinetic quantities and the statistics of boundary irregularities , as well as mutual correlation of the opposite boundaries .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    "we have studied the case of a single - mode 2d conductor with statistically identical rough side boundaries . the particular model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite of the wire with completely correlated boundaries ( ccb ) is equivalent to the deterministic waveguide system of constant width whose inhomogeneities consist in solely waveguide bends . it was shown that the electron dynamics in such conducting strips is governed by quite a different hamiltonian than that pertinent to the seemingly more general model of 2d conductor with one boundary which is rough and the other being ideally flat @xcite .",

    "@xcite and fluctuation of their slopes in ref .",
    "@xcite . provided the supposition is true , when studying particle or classical wave transport in surface - corrugated waveguide systems one has to distinguish between two different non - interfering scattering mechanisms which we call by - height ( bh ) and by - slope ( bs ) scattering .",
    "however , it should be noted that quantum wave scattering was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for different waveguide geometries and with the use of substantially different methods .",
    "therefore , the conjecture stated in ref .",
    "@xcite about the relative significance of these scattering mechanisms needs to be additionally substantiated .    to avoid possible misunderstanding and support our idea of different scattering mechanisms pertaining to the imperfect boundaries of guiding systems , we examine the waveguide ( conductor ) geometry admitting of both bh and bs scattering simultaneously .",
    "we consider a 2d conducting strip with statistically symmetrical rough boundaries ( the abbreviation ssb will be used for such a strip , in contrast to the ccb strip considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is physically equivalent to the waveguide with a straight central line ( guiding axis ) and a randomly fluctuating width .",
    "it will be shown below that the suggested model of the waveguide corresponds qualitatively to a 2d wire with opposite side boundaries whose inter - correlation can be thought of as arbitrary . for the ssb model , as well as for the arbitrary 2d waveguide ,",
    "the presence is typical of both bh and bs scattering mechanisms .",
    "it is noteworthy that these mechanisms compete with one another , depending on the roughness statistical parameters , even in the simplest case of boundary asperities being small in height and rather smooth .",
    "technically , specifying the scattering mechanisms is most straightforward by reducing the problem of the electron scattering from complicated boundaries of the conductor to the appropriate `` bulk '' problem specified by a complex hamiltonian but simple boundary conditions .",
    "analysis of the problem thus formulated can often be found much easier than of the problem with complicated boundary conditions .",
    "in some cases it can even be performed non - perturbatively . in this work , using such an approach , we managed to reasonably discriminate between bh and bs scattering mechanisms and analyze their competition in the electron - surface scattering . besides , solving the `` surface '' problem in `` bulk '' formulation enabled us to carefully trace such a fine _ spectral _ effect as the anderson localization of current carriers .",
    "note that the method for solving the problems of the by - surface scattering through reduction to the hamiltonian form is not quite original .",

    "@xcite and @xcite where the coordinate transformation was used , which smooths out the rough surface to the flat one . in this paper ,",
    "analogous reduction of a `` surface '' problem to the hamiltonian formulation is made by merely going over to the _ local mode representation_. this approach ensures the optimal choice of trial quantum states which serve as a basis for the perturbation theory . in our view , it is essential that the mode states _ a priori _ contain the information on lateral confinement of the system under consideration and , therefore , are more adjusted to perturbative treatment of transport problems in waveguide - like systems than the widely used isotropic plane - wave basis .",
