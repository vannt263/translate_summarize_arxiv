    "the upper central series is the increasing sequence of ideals defined as follows : @xmath2 \\subset c_i(\\mathfrak{g})\\}.\\ ] ] in other words @xmath3 is the inverse image under the canonical mapping of @xmath4 onto @xmath5 of the center of @xmath5 .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath4 is called _ nilpotent _ if there is an integer @xmath6 such that @xmath7 the minimal such @xmath6 is called the _ index of nilpotency _ ,  @xcite .",
    "a connected lie group is nilpotent if and only if its lie algebra is nilpotent .",
    "a _ nilmanifold _ @xmath8 is a compact homogeneous space of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a simply connected nilpotent lie group and @xmath11 is a discrete cocompact subgroup in @xmath10 ,  @xcite .",
    "for example , an @xmath12-dimensional torus @xmath13 is obviously a nilmanifold . if we consider the group @xmath14 of upper triangular matrices having 1s along the diagonal then the quotient @xmath15 is a nilmanifold , called the heisenberg nilmanifold , where @xmath16 is the set of matrices having integral entries .",
    "+ let @xmath17 be a nilmanifold and let @xmath18 be the lie algebra of the lie group @xmath10 .",
    "it is well - known that the exponential map @xmath19 is a global diffeomorphism and the quotient map @xmath20 is the universal covering map .",
    "hence every nilmanifold is the eilenberg - maclane space @xmath21 . by malcev",
    "s theorem a discrete group @xmath11 can be realized as the fundamental group of a nilmanifold if and only if it is a finitely presented nilpotent torsion free group  @xcite .",

    "it is clear that every nilmanifold @xmath9 is a nilpotent space since @xmath26 is nilpotent and all higher homotopy groups @xmath27 are trivial .",
    "hence , it follows from the fundamental theorem of the rational homotopy theory  @xcite that two nilmanifolds have the same rational homotopy type if and only if the corresponding chevalley - eilenberg complexes are isomorphic .    [",

    "then the non - integrability condition can be expressed by the inequality @xmath52 , i.e. the form @xmath53 is nowhere zero . such differential form @xmath50 is called a _ contact differential form_. a contact structure can be viewed as an equivalence class of contact differential forms , where two forms @xmath50 and @xmath54 are equivalent if and only if @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a nowhere zero smooth function on @xmath8 .",
    "a _ contact manifold _ is a pair @xmath57 where @xmath8 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath47 and @xmath58 is a contact structure on @xmath8 ,  @xcite .",

    "many attempts have been done on this topic .",

    ", we first apply  remark  r : invar .",
    "so , we must check whether the nilpotent lie algebras from the gong s list admit a contact structure . to achieve this goal",
    ", we use the sullivan minimal model theory and  corollary  c : ce ( see sections  [ s : min ] and [ s : main ] ) .",
    "next , for a given 7-dimensional nilpotent lie algebra having a contact structure , we must check whether the corresponding simply connected lie group contains a discrete cocompact subgroup . for this",

    "the natural inclusion of the complex of right invariant differential forms on @xmath10 into the complex of the differential forms on @xmath62 @xmath98 induces an isomorphism on the cohomology level .",

    "then the derivative @xmath119 will contain no terms with @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",

    "it follows that the nilmanifold @xmath62 can not admit an invariant differential form @xmath58 such that @xmath125 .",
    "now we discuss the existence of contact structures on indecomposable lie algebras .",
    "we have proved that there are no contact structures on decomposable nilpotent lie algebras , see theorem  t : indecom above .",
    "all 7-dimensiomal indecomposable nilpotent lie algebras over the real field have been classified ,  @xcite . over reals",
    "there are 138 non - isomorphic 7-dimensiomal indecomposable nilpotent lie algebras and , in addition , 9 one - parameter families .",
    "for the one - parameter families , a parameter @xmath126 is used to denote a structure constant that may take on arbitrary values ( with some exceptions ) in @xmath127 an invariant @xmath128 is given for each family in which multiple values of @xmath126 yield isomorphic lie algebras , i.e. , if @xmath129 , then the two corresponding lie algebras are isomorphic , and conversely .",
    "all one - parameter families admit a contact structure ( with some restrictions on a parameter @xmath126 ) and only @xmath130 lie algebras admit a contact structure .",
    "we conduct a detailed computation for the algebra ( 1357c ) and the one - parameter family ( 147e ) . here",
    "we use the same notation for the lie algebras as in  @xcite , where the lie algebras are listed in accordance with their upper central series dimensions . for instance , the lie algebras that have the upper central series dimensions 1,4,7 are listed as follows : ( 147a ) , ( 147b ) , ( 147c ) , etc . for the sake of brevity",
    "we will drop the sign of the wedge product ( for instance , @xmath131 means @xmath132 ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be a 7-dimensional nilpotent lie algebra with the basis @xmath133 and the corresponding dual basis @xmath134 . consider the chevalley - eilenberg complex @xmath135 of the lie algebra @xmath29 . if one can not find nonzero structural constants @xmath136 such that @xmath137 then @xmath18 does not admit a contact structure because for every @xmath59-form @xmath138 on @xmath18 the @xmath139-form @xmath140 contains at most five distinct elements from the basis @xmath141 and therefore @xmath142 .",
    "for this reason @xmath143 @xmath0-dimensional indecomposable nilpotent lie algebras that are listed in  @xcite , pp.@xmath144 do not admit a contact structure and therefore we do not list them in our paper .",
    "thus , if a 7-dimensional simply connected nilpotent lie group @xmath10 admits a discrete cocompact subgroup @xmath145 and the lie algebra @xmath18 of @xmath100 falls into this list of @xmath143 @xmath0-dimensional indecomposable nilpotent lie algebras then the nilmanifold @xmath17 does not admit an invariant contact structure .",

    "note that @xmath146 stands for the upper central series dimensions .",
