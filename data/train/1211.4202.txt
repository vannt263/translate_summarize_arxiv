    "so a level crossing means the change of the parity in the ground state .",
    "in contrast , there are only avoided - crossings of levels in rabi model , which yield unchanged parity .",
    "so the rwa effect can be reflected from the parity change . in our present work , however , due to the introduction of the additional term regarding @xmath147 , no level crossing exists anymore in the jc model , but only avoided - crossings , as shown in fig .",
    "so we may consider other characteristic properties , such as scaling behavior , for understanding the effect of the rwa .",
