    "the very small cross sections of synthesis of superheavy elements require to find favorable reactions ( projectile and target pair ) and the optimal beam energy range which is very narrow ( no more 10 mev ) .",
    "it is necessary to establish conditions to increase the events of the er formation .",
    "the experimental way to estimate possibility of the synthesis of the wanted superheavy element is to study yield of fissionlike products and their mass - angle distributions .",
    "the presence of the mass - symmetric or around mass - symmetric binary reaction products and their isotropic angular distribution is a necessary condition .",
    "the cn formation must survive against fission to be registered as the evaporation residue .",
    "the fission probability can be very large due to decrease or disappearance of the fission barrier at large values of the excitation and rotational energies of the just formed cn .",
    "so , survival probability of the heated and rotating cn against fission is also an important factor which is subject for the further theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism in collision of massive nuclei and of the range of the favorable beam energy are essential .",
    "the er formation process is the last stage of the reaction mechanism in heavy ion collisions near the coulomb barrier energies .",
    "the sketch of the preceded stages to formation of the evaporation residues is presented in fig .",
    "[ stages ] . naturally , the threshold interaction of projectile and target nuclei ending with the er formation begins with the multinucleon transfer reactions .",
    "we should distinguish two kinds of reactions which are in competition during heavy ion collisions at low ( near the coulomb barrier ) energies of the projectile .",
    "the first one is deep - inelastic collisions and the second one is capture reactions shown on the top of fig . [ stages ] .",
    "the difference between capture and deep - inelastic collision is whether a path of the relative motion has been trapped into the well of the nucleus - nucleus interaction or not ( see fig .",
    "[ trapwell ] ) . in the case of capture",
    "the full momentum transfer takes place , while it does not in the deep - inelastic collisions ( i - channel of binary reaction in heavy ion collisions , see fig .",
    "[ stages ] ) . in both cases",
    "the dinuclear system ( dns ) will be formed .",
    "the lifetime of the dns formed in the capture process will be sufficiently long .",
    "two conditions must be satisfied for capture : 1 ) the initial energy @xmath15 of projectile in the center - of - mass system should be sufficiently large to overcome the interaction barrier ( coulomb barrier + rotational energy of the entrance channel ) , 2 ) some part of the relative kinetic energy has to be dissipated in order that dns would be trapped in the well of the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential @xcite . if there is not a potential well the deep - inelastic collision takes place only . here",
    "we state that mass distributions of the deep - inelastic collision and capture reaction ( quasifission ) products may overlap in reactions with nuclei having magic proton or / and neutron numbers @xcite . in this case , usually , the contribution of quasifission is arrogated to the deep - inelastic collision .",
    "the capture is the first step in the way to er formation , and it leads to formation of a molecule - like dns which can evolve by changing its charge and mass asymmetry due to multinucleon transfer and by changing its shape .",
    "the angular velocity of the rotating dns depends on the initial value of orbital angular momentum which is determined by the impact parameter @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 of the collision : @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the study of dynamics of the heavy ion collisions near the coulomb barrier energies showed that complete fusion does not occur immediately in the case of massive nucleus collisions @xcite . in ref .",

    "one of interesting conclusions of authors is that taking into account dynamical deformation of dns fragments leads to the decrease of the fusion probability and , consequently , to the decrease of the er formation cross section . but",

    "@xcite restricted by analysis of the collision with the tip - tip orientation of the two deformed nuclei .",
    "evolution of dns may end with the cn formation in the equilibrium state or may arrive at two fragments without reaching the cn state .",
    "quasifission takes place when dns prefers to break down into two fragments instead of being transformed into fully equilibrated cn .",
    "for example , the total kinetic energy of the quasifission fragments is close to that of fission fragments .",
    "the mass and angular distributions of the fragments depend on the entrance channel properties and may overlap , causing difficulties in identification of a mechanism which produces the corresponding reaction products @xcite .",
    "we should stress the dominant role of the quasifission channel in reactions with massive nuclei that causes strong hindrance to the formation of cn during the evolution of dns .",
    "this important topic will be discussed in the present paper .",

    "this fusion - fission channel can be enriched by the fast fission products",
    ". fast fission , which requires no fission barrier , is splitting of mononucleus before reaching equilibrated cn .",
    "the properties of fission barrier can be described by liquid drop model for the intermediate mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "the stability of very heavy atomic nuclei with charge number @xmath22 106 against fission appears only due to shell effects in their binding energy @xcite , which is sensitive to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 values .",
    "fission barrier of nucleus related with both nature ( liquid drop and shell effect ) disappears at large values of angular momentum @xmath25 @xcite and when shell effects have been completely damped @xcite as a function of the excitation energy and angular momentum .",
    "the increase of the angular momentum leads to damping of the shell effects and a mononucleus which has survived against quasifission can not reach cn equilibrium shape and suffers fast fission . at last , the cn , which survived against fission by emission of particles during its cooling , forms the er which is a product of channel ( iv ) in fig .",

    "the potential well disappears by the increase of ( small values of @xmath23 ) at the large values of orientation angles @xmath50 .",
    "this reason ( the shallowness of the potential well ) leads to the decreasing the contribution from collision of nuclei into capture with the small values of @xmath50 at large energies since the dissipation of the relative motion is not enough to cause trapping of the collision path into potential well .",
    "this case is demonstrated in fig .",

    "the advantage of the charge asymmetric system in complete fusion appears at the second stage ( fusion ) of the reaction mechanism leading to the er formation .",
    "it is well known that the hindrance to complete fusion decreases with the increasing dns charge asymmetry . at the same time the dns quasifission barrier , @xmath160 , increases since the coulomb repulsion forces decrease with the decrease of the product @xmath163 .",

    "@xcite ) the superheavy element @xmath165118 was observed after emission of three neutrons from the @xmath164118 cn , at two projectile energies corresponding to @xmath166=29.2 and 34.4 mev . as seen in fig .",
    "[ erca249cf ] the maximum values of cross sections connected with the 2n , 3n , and 4n emission channels are in the range between 0.3 pb and 1.2 pb .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ ernith ] that the results obtained for all @xmath75n - channels of er formation in the @xmath8ni+@xmath3th reaction are very small .",

    "this is due to the effect of the different @xmath24 threshold values for the 3n channel when the masses of table @xcite and warsaw group @xcite are considered .",
    "in the first case the threshold energy for the 3n channel is at the @xmath16735 mev , while for the second case it is at @xmath16830.5 mev . due to the above - mentioned conditions for the @xmath8ni+@xmath3th reaction",
    ", the excitation function of the 3n channel is strongly different in comparison with the ones shown in fig .",

    "the experimental results about synthesis of @xmath11=118 , which were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , are in this range .",
    "the results of the er excitation functions for the @xmath2fe+ @xmath3th reaction indicate that this reaction is less favorable to be used in the synthesis of superheavy element @xmath6 .",
    "the largest cross section for the 3n - channel is about 1 pb ( see fig . [ er58feth ] ) , if we use the mass tables of mller and nix @xcite ( thin dashed line ) , while the use of the mass table and fission barriers of warsaw group leads to much lower cross sections ( thick dashed line ) , no more than 40 fb .",
    "the modern state of the experimental setup does not allow to observe these events .",
    "the results obtained for all @xmath75n - channels of er formation in the @xmath8ni+@xmath3th reaction are very small ( see fig .",
    "[ ernith ] ) .",
    "the largest point of the 4n - channel curve is about 10 fb ( thin solid line ) when masses from the mller and nix table @xcite were used in our calculations .",
    "the use of the warsaw group mass tables @xcite leads to values of the er cross sections , which are one order of magnitude lower than former case .",

    ".    the reactions with the @xmath3th target and @xmath2fe and @xmath8ni projectiles can be useful to study the role of the entrance channel and nuclear structure in formation of the fusion - fission and quasifission products . from the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fuscacm ] and [ fusfeth ] we can state that the fusion excitation function for the @xmath2fe+@xmath3th reaction is from 10@xmath169 to @xmath170 orders lower than the one calculated for the @xmath0ca+ @xmath1 cm reaction depending on the beam energy .",
    "the fusion cross sections of these compared reactions come closer at large collision energies but excitation energy @xmath24 of cn is so large and the er cross sections of @xmath75n channels become negligibly small ( see figs .",
    "[ ercacm ] and [ er58feth ] )    the strong hindrance at low energies is caused by the large intrinsic fusion barrier @xmath53 for the small orientation angles of the symmetry axis of the deformed projectile @xmath2fe ( @xmath171 ) and target @xmath3th ( @xmath172 ) nuclei .",
