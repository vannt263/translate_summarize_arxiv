    "knowing the spectrum of quantum mechanical states of an electron in magnetic field there are two ways of calculating the thermal gyroradius at given temperature @xmath24 .",
    "either the gyroradius is calculated by averaging it over the distribution  which is its expectation value @xmath13 , would be the exact way to do it  , or one calculates the energy expectation value @xmath32 which provides the expectation value of the squared gyroradius @xmath33 whose root can also be taken to represent the thermal gyroradius .",
    "this latter value will be calculated first .",
    "the energy levels of an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field ( the case of interest here as a magnetic inhomogeneity provides only higher order corrections ) has been calculated long ago @xcite .",
    "since the parallel dynamics of an electron is not of interest here , it can be taken classically .",
    "then the energy of an electron in the magnetic field becomes @xmath34 with @xmath35 , quantum number @xmath36 , and @xmath37 the two spin directions .",
    "the average distribution of electrons over these @xmath36 perpendicular energy states is given by the fermi distribution @xmath38 written here for the anisotropic case , with @xmath39 the fugacity which depends on the chemical potentials @xmath40 in parallel and perpendicular direction , and @xmath41 are the inverse temperatures ( in energy units ) .",
    "at sufficiently large temperatures the unity in the denominator is neglected , a very well justified approximation which still takes into account the non - continuous energy distribution over discrete landau levels thus maintaining the quantum character of electrons .",
    "the fugacities enter into the normalization constant now .",
    "this is the case far away from eq .",
    "( [ denslim ] ) which for plasmas interests us here . under these conditions",
    "the expectation value of the ( average ) perpendicular energy of the electrons ( i.e.the perpendicular electron pressure ) is calculated from the integral @xmath42 the spin contribution in the perpendicular energy either compensates for the half landau energy level or completes it to the first order level .",
    "thus the sum splits into two terms which both are geometric progressions which can immediately be done .",
    "the final result , using the normalization of the integral to the average density of particles and dividing through @xmath43 thus yields for the average energy @xmath44 at the assumed large temperatures the exponentials must be expanded to first order yielding the very well known and expected classical result that the average energy is the temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "hence , taking its root and inserting into the gyroradius we find what is expected in this case : @xmath46 this is the root - mean - square gyroradius , a well known quantity . at lower temperatures @xmath47 , still by far exceeding fermi energy .",
    "the former expression for @xmath32 has to be used in this expression .      however , the correct gyroradius is not its root mean square but the expectation value @xmath48 .",
    "this is substantially more difficult to calculate .",
    "there are two ways of finding the expectation value .",
    "either one makes use of the landau solution of the electron wave function and refers to the wigner distribution of quantum mechanical states .",
    "this , for our purposes would be overdoing the problem substantially .",
    "we do not need the quantum mechanical probability distribution for the simple estimate we envisage here .",
    "afterwards we would anyway have to combine the wigner function with a suitable momentum distribution .",
    "the second and simpler way is to refer to the above fermi distribution and directly using the energy distribution as above . under the same conditions as in the calculation of the rms value",
    ", this procedure circumvents the use of the wave function being interested only in the energy levels .",
    "it , however , requires the solution of the integral - sum @xmath49 the sum , the integral contains , can not anymore be done in closed form as there is no known way to tackle the summation over the root quantum index @xmath36 in a non - geometric progression .",
    "( we may note in passing that for a non - moving plasma calculating the average velocity moment would lead to a null result .",
    "however , in calculating the expectation value of the gyroradius , the perpendicular velocity , being a radius vector in perpendicular velocity space , is always positive .",
    "this is reflected by the summation over positive quantum numbers @xmath36 only .",
    "it and the gyroradius are positive definite quantities which both do not average out . )",
    "one thus needs to deviate from summing and to approximate the sum by an integral , which slightly overestimates the final result . transforming the energy into a continuous variable , which implies that the summation index becomes continuous , then simply leaves us with a gaussian integral of which we know that the mean value and the rms values are related by the classical formula @xmath50 the classical result for the mean , where by the @xmath51 sign we indicated that the integral yields an upper limit for the expectation value of the gyroradius .",
    "the above estimates permit determining the thermal fluctuation ( thermal spread ) of the gyroradius .",
    "this fluctuation is the difference between the mean square and squared expectation values . with the above results we find that the thermal fluctuation of the gyroradius amounts to @xmath52 this number falls into the @xmath0 range of `` freedom '' in choosing the thermal speed that is commonly used in the definition of the rms gyroradius as either @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "the expected result of the quantum mechanical calculation of the electron gyroradius of a hot plasma is that the root - mean - square value of the gyroradius is reproduced by quantum mechanics in the high temperature limit which clearly completely justifies its use not adding anything new except for the confirmation of well - known facts which can be generated in much simpler way by using the boltzmann calculation . for lower temperatures we obtained a slightly more precise expression for the average energy which should be used in the definition of the thermal gyroradius .",
    "the expectation value of the gyroradius is different from the root mean square value , which is also known .",
    "its value is lower given by the gaussian mean .",
    "usually this value is not used in any classical calculation .",
    "the difference between both values is within the commonly used @xmath0 freedom for choosing the rms thermal speed .",
    "the above calculation is based on keeping the discrete distribution of all plasma electrons over landau levels .",
    "since these are equally spaced up to infinity , the energy remains discontinuous even at large temperatures .",
    "the correction is , however , unimportant .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that the discrete distribution of electron energies is reflected in the dielectric function of a plasma which leads to collective cyclotron harmonics , i.e. bernstein modes .",
    "however , landau levels have nothing in common with cyclotron harmonics .",
    "they are single particle energy levels occupied at most by two electrons of oppositely directed spins , while cyclotron harmonics are eigenmodes of the magnetized plasma , channels which allow for propagation of electro(magnetic ) signals .",
    "the discrete energy distribution of the electrons naturally disappears in the cacluation of the expectation values and is not reflected in any cyclotron harmonic waves .",
    "the average gyroradius appearing in the arguments of the modified bessel functions in the dielectric expression of the harmonics in the combination @xmath55 is a",
    "_ mere scaling factor _ of wavelengths related to the perpendicular thermal speed .",
    "it can not be taken as definition of a gyroradius , which is a particle property .",
    "in fact , calculation of the dielectric function from quantum mechanics accounting for the landau energy distribution is very difficult . in classical theory one integrates the vlasov equation with respect to time along classical particle orbits @xmath56 which , in quantum mechanics , is forbidden as _ no orbits exist_. orbits are replaced by probability distributions in space varying with time .",
    "the calculation therefore needs to be performed via a feynman path integral approach which has not yet been done .",
    "it is , however , reasonably expected that it will , in the classical limit reproduce the classical dielectric function and the harmonic structure of bernstein and cyclotron modes .",
