    "before we describe the ideas and content of this work , we wish to give a brief discussion of certain ideas concerning lensing that are really quite obvious but are often overlooked and or confused .",
    "it is absolutely clear that any source of light emits many rays that travel in many directions and get distorted by all the different available lenses .",
    "but for an observer , of all those different rays , the only ones of relevance are the rays that enter the observers `` eyes ; '' all the others are `` lost '' to that observer and play no role at all in his or her treatment of lensing .",
    "the conclusion from this is that at any one time , it is the past lightcone of the observer that is the object to be studied and understood .",
    "it is the bending and distortions of the rays and pencils of rays lying on this past cone that constitute the basic elements that make up lensing theory .",
    "when this past cone intersects a source , that source is then seen by the observer ; if it is a point source then ideally only one ray reaches the observer , if it is a small but finite source then a pencil of rays , lying on the past cone , reaches the observer . in this later case",
    "the pencil can be described by the geodesic deviation vectors ( or jacobi field ) associated with just one ray .",
    "the shape of the pencil can and will , in general , undergo changes due to the presence of gravitational field along the path of the one ray .",
    "it is this change in the shape of the pencil , between the source and the observer , that constitutes image distortion .",
    "this is the point of view that we adopt throughout this paper  though the details are very different , the point of view concerning the essential role of the past cone applies equally well to the thin lens approximation ( the standard approach ) and to the non - perturbative approach to lensing .",
    "it is often the case in gravitational lensing that the distortion of extended images provides as much information to the practicing astrophysicist as the location of the images themselves  @xcite . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the theory of gravitational lensing has been developed and studied from a first principles point of view , where lensing is considered non - perturbatively with no restrictions on the strength of the gravitational field . this work is non - perturbative in the sense that the key equations of lensing theory , the lens and time of arrival equations , are derived by integrating ( as far as possible ) the null geodesic equations of an ( in principle ) exact metric .",
    "this point of view is in contrast to the more standard work in lensing based on the thin lens approximation where lenses `` live '' in some fixed background spacetime . in the present paper and its companion  @xcite",
    ", we turn our attention to the non - perturbative study of distortion of images due to lensing .",
    "images are distorted by a lens in multiple ways .",
    "first , an image may be magnified or demagnified , relative to what the image would look like `` in the absence of the lens . ''",
    "magnification is due to the focusing of the lightcone by the spacetime curvature , and the study of magnification is closely related to catastrophe optics and singularity theory  @xcite .",
    "the magnification of images has proved to be an extremely useful property of lensing systems because it often allows for the observation of very distant sources which may not have been observed without the magnification .",
    "perhaps more importantly , an extended image may be stretched along some axis , rotated , or made generally larger or smaller relative to an `` unlensed image . ''",
    "colloquially , we say that the stretching along an axis and rotation of an image is related to the `` shearing '' of the pencil of light and that an overall change in size is due to the `` convergence '' ( or alternatively , `` expansion '' or `` divergence '' ) of the pencil .",
    "these effects are very important in lens modeling , as the distortion of an extended image into an arc or of identifiable parts of an image ( such as the radio jets of a qso ) provides very useful observational constraints on the lens model .",
    "in general relativity , the shear and the convergence are precisely defined quantities  @xcite which have values at each point along a geodesic .",
    "these quantities , often refered to as the optical scalars , have been widely studied in the relativity community .",
    "hence , the general use of these terms in lensing , where an image  observed here  of a source  over there  is said to be `` sheared '' can be a little misleading .",
    "one goal of this paper and its companion is to propose a unified framework for the non - perturbative discussion of the distortion of images which can be applied in strong - field regimes . in this paper , we introduce three quantities , the _ shape parameters _ , describing the generic appearance of an elliptical image or source and show how the shape parameters are computed from connecting vectors .",
    "we also introduce three _ distortion parameters _ which correspond to changes in the shape parameters between the source and observer . in the following paper",
    ", we relate the shape and distortion parameters to the optical scalars .",
    "this paper begins by reviewing the standard ( thin - lens ) approach to the distortion of images as presented in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the key idea of using the inverse jacobian of the lens equations to map source curves ( the outline or boundary of sources ) into image curves .",
    "we define the shape parameters at the end of this section and briefly mention the quantities which are referred to as the `` shear '' and `` convergence '' in the thin lens approximation .",
    "( the full discussion of these quantities is left to the second paper , which is devoted to the relationship between the shape parameters and optical scalars . ) in the third section of this paper , we present the non - perturbative version of the shape parameters and define the distortion of images .",
    "this section relies heavily on the use of connecting vectors or jacobi fields ( we follow the lead of other authors in the use of jacobi fields in lensing , in particular  @xcite ) .",
    "the distortion of images in schwarzschild spacetime is discussed at the conclusion of this section .",
    "finally , we provide a different perspective on the subject in sec .  [",
    "sec : gauge ] which we feel clarifies several issues regarding the role of the choice of coordinates .",
    "an important caveat must be stated . in a generic lensing",
    "situation , if the past lightcone is continued arbitrarily far into the past , caustics will always be found .",
    "we , in this work , are making the assumption that our source that is being imaged _ does not _",
    "intersect a caustic curve .",
    "the morphology of image construction for sources which lie across a caustic is well understood but relatively complicated .",
    "the issue of distortion of images in this case is something for further study .",
    "in this section we summarize the approach to image distortion in standard gravitational lensing according to  @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of the thin lens approximation are that the source , lens , and observer are at rest in the background spacetime , that the gravitational fields are weak , that all angles are small , and that the mass distribution of the entire lens can be collapsed into a single two - dimensional `` lens plane '' and is described by a surface mass - density , @xmath0 . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortioni1 ] , light rays are assumed to travel along the null geodesics of the background spacetime from a point in the source plane at @xmath1 to a point in the lens plane ( the plane containing the lens and perpendicular to the optical axis ) at @xmath2 . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the ray is instantaneously bent by a bending angle , @xmath3 , and travels to the observer @xmath4 along another background geodesic .",
    "a goal of the thin lens approximation is to find a set of equations , called lens equations , which represent the path of the light ray as a mapping between the lens plane and the source plane .",
    "the lens plane is described by the two dimensional vector @xmath5 , and the source plane is described by the two dimensional vector @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce two scaled vectors    @xmath7    which describe the lens @xmath8 and source @xmath9 planes . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the angular - diameter distances between the observer and source and observer and lens .",
    "the dynamics of the thin lens approximation is introduced through a deflection potential    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the surface mass - density , satisfying the two - dimensional laplace equation    @xmath14    the lens mapping from the lens plane to the source plane , or from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , is a gradient mapping :    @xmath17    or ,    @xmath18    equation  ( [ tllenseq ] ) is the lens equation of the thin - lens approximation under the scaling defined by eqs .",
    "( [ scaled ] ) .",
    "an alternative perspective is to derive the lens equation , eq .",
    "( [ tllenseq ] ) , by applying a stationarity condition to a fermat potential .",
    "if we define    @xmath19    as a fermat potential , the gradient mapping is equivalent to the condition    @xmath20    i.e. , the lens equation , eq .",
    "( [ tllenseq2 ] ) , follows from fermat s principle .",
    "( we generalize the idea of a fermat potential in sec .",

    "note that the second derivativeof @xmath21 with respect to @xmath15 is equal tothe derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath15 as defined ineq .",
    "( [ tllenseq ] ) .",
    "the distortion of images can be studied via the jacobian of the lens mapping    @xmath22    we see that the jacobian matrix is symmetric .",
    "this symmetry exists , essentially , only in the special coordinates used .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "iv how this result arises non - perturbatively .    using the lens equation , eq .",
    "( [ tllenseq ] ) , we see that the jacobian matrix has the form    @xmath23    where subscripts denote derivatives with respect to the components of @xmath24 . by defining    @xmath25    and using eq .",
    "( [ 2dimlaplace ] ) , we can rewrite the jacobian matrix as    @xmath26    where we have dropped the explicit @xmath15 dependence in @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it has become customary in the lensing community  @xcite to refer to @xmath29 as the _ convergence _ , and @xmath30 as the _ shear _ . in this and the subsequent paper  @xcite , however , we will reserve the names of convergence and shear for the optical scalars of a null geodesic congruence .",
    "we show in our subsequent paper that ( modulo terms involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) @xmath29 and @xmath31 are _ essentially _ the values of the convergence and shear of the observer s past lightcone _ at the lens plane _ on the source s side .    in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the invariants of @xmath32 are    @xmath33    where @xmath34 are the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix . when @xmath35 , the lens mapping is singular and the source lies at a caustic of the past cone .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 , referred to as the _ magnification _ , is the factor by which the image s brightness is magnified with respect to the unlensed source .",
    "another important use of the jacobian is to help understand the changes in the shape of the image of a small source . to see this",
    ", we note that a ( suitably scaled ) connecting vector , @xmath37 , at @xmath15 in the lens plane , is mapped into a ( suitably scaled ) connecting vector , @xmath38 , at @xmath16 in the source plane , by @xmath32 , while @xmath39 maps source plane vectors back to the lens plane :    @xmath40    for instance , if a small circle of radius @xmath41 at @xmath16 in the source plane is described by    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , an image of this circle is an ellipse , in the lens or image plane , described by    @xmath44    hence , the jacobian matrix , @xmath32 , and its inverse , @xmath39 , which is referred to as the _ magnification matrix _",
    ", play a large role in the description of the images of small sources .",
    "the semiaxes of the ellipse described by eq .",
    "( [ tlellipse ] ) must be parallel to the principal axes of the magnification matrix @xmath39 , which are the same as the principal axes of @xmath32 .",
    "this is because there are two vectors @xmath45 , which are parallel to the two eigenvectors of @xmath32 and are mapped into themselves by @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "these two directions undergo the maximum stretching and squeezing because the eigendirections of a symmetric linear map are those which have the greatest and least stretching .",
    "hence , the lengths of the major and minor semiaxes are    @xmath46    the locations of these axes are given by the angles , @xmath47 , which satisfy    @xmath48    i.e. , in the directions    @xmath49    this result is obtained [ via extremizing @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 by finding the angles , @xmath52 , for vectors of the form of @xmath43 which are the eigenvectors .",
    "we are now in the position to define our shape parameters .",
    "the first shape parameter is the ratio of the lengths of the semimajor and semiminor axes , @xmath53 .",
    "this ratio is given by    @xmath54    in the thin - lens approximation .",
    "the second shape parameter is the area of the ellipse factored by @xmath55 , or the product of the two semiaxes , which we refer to as the area of the ellipse ( since the area is proportional to the product of the semiaxes with a factor of @xmath55 ) . for the thin lens approximation , the ( factored ) area",
    "is given by    @xmath56    the final shape parameter is the orientation of the major semiaxis , @xmath57 . by convention",
    ", we define @xmath57 to be @xmath58 .    thus ,",
    "there are three quantities of interest in describing the image of a circular source : the ( suitably scaled ) area of the image @xmath59 , which encodes the overall scaling of the image compared to the source ; the ratio of the semiaxes @xmath60 which is a measure of the distortion up to scale ; and the orientation of the semimajor axis @xmath61",
    ". this definition of the orientation does not have a definite meaning without a reference axis or when referred to a circular source but it can be assigned a meaning for an elliptical source when the discussion is generalized slightly as will be done later in this article .",
    "we refer to these three quantities as the _ shape parameters_. they will be defined non - perturbatively in the next section .",
    "we are interested in understanding image distortion within general relativity with no approximations .",
    "we refer to this approach to image distortion as a non - perturbative approach , to distinguish it from the standard approach which is based on linearized perturbations around flat space or an isotropic cosmological model .    to this effect",
    ", we need two things . first , we need a non - perturbative counterpart of the lens mapping .",
    "once the lens mapping is given , the jacobian matrix , or its inverse , the magnification matrix , can be obtained .",
    "second , we need non - perturbative definitions for image and source shapes , and _ distortion parameters _ , which encode the changes between the shapes of the source and the image , in terms of the magnification matrix .      at any fixed time",
    "the observer `` sees '' each source ( on his or her past lightcone ) projected onto the observer s celestial sphere . by introducing spherical coordinates , @xmath62 , for each ray , via this projection ,",
    "the observer encodes a mapping between an image location , @xmath62 , and a source location .",
    "a formal lens mapping can be obtained by the following considerations , summarized from @xcite .",
    "similar considerations have been studied recently by other authors  @xcite . in particular , see  @xcite for exact lensing in kerr spacetime .    in a four dimensional lorentzian space - time ,",
    "@xmath63 , with local coordinates @xmath64 , we assume that an expression for the past lightcone of the observer , obtained by integrating the null geodesic equations , is available .",

    "our non - perturbative version of a lens mapping differs from the standard lens mapping , in addition to being non - perturbative , in the sense that we do not use explicitly the einstein equations ",
    "we simply consider any lorentzian metric @xmath84 and its null geodesics to construct the observer s past cones and the resulting lens equation . in most thin - lens treatments of lensing the linearized einstein equations ( in the form @xmath85 )",

    "consider the situation where there is an extended source at some distance from an observer .",
    "the source s worldtube intersects the observer s past lightcone , and we assume that the intersection occurs in a region of the past lightcone where there are no caustics .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : distiib ] .",
    "the intersection determines the source s visible shape . the pencil of rays that joins the shape of the source to the observer `` carries '' the shape of the source into the shape of the image , on the observer s celestial sphere . for the lensing purposes , thus ,",
    "an extended source consists of a collection of individual point sources , all of which are connected to the observer by individual null geodesics . in general",
    ", the image of an extended source must be obtained by imaging each individual point via the non - perturbative lens equation . however ,",
    "if the sources are `` small , '' we can , in the spirit of the previous section , describe sources by _ connecting vectors _ along one of the null geodesics ( a `` central '' one ) , with image directions @xmath62 , that joins the source to the observer .",
    "jacobi fields ( or connecting vectors ) are solutions to the geodesic deviation equation along that _ fixed _ geodesic . in the case of null geodesics ,",
    "the space of jacobi fields is two - dimensional and can be obtained in our approach directly from our non - perturbative lens mapping eq .",
    "( [ pastlc ] ) in the following manner .",
    "we note that there are three natural vectors that can be associated with either the past lightcone or equivalently with the lens equation , eq .",
    "( [ pastlc ] ) .",
    "the first one is the tangent to the geodesics in the lightcone :    @xmath86    the remaining two are the jacobi fields    @xmath87    these two vectors are , in general , linearly independent and connect neighboring geodesics at a fixed value of @xmath68 , so they are two linearly independent jacobi fields ( except at a caustic ) . they are orthogonal to the tangent vector @xmath88 because they lie on the lightcone : @xmath89 , and they are spacelike . though any other jacobi field is a linear combination of @xmath90 with constant parameters @xmath91 ,    @xmath92    we refer to @xmath90 as the `` natural '' jacobi fields .",
    "two other important vector fields ( not jacobi fields ) associated with any null geodesic are the pair of spacelike , orthonormal , parallel propagated vectors that are normal to @xmath88 .",
    "they provide a means to refer to directions that are `` the same '' at the orthogonal tangent spaces at the source and at the observer .",
    "analytically they are given by    @xmath93    where @xmath94 denotes the scalar product between two vectors , @xmath95 .",
    "the natural connecting vectors , @xmath90 , in general , will have transverse components along the space spanned by @xmath96 , and a longitudinal component along the geodesic congruence @xmath88 .",
    "the component along @xmath88 has no significance since it corresponds to reparametrizations of the null geodesic .",
    "jacobi fields thus have two essential transverse components .",
    "two linearly independent jacobi fields can thus be thought as two two - component vectors that are obtained by derivation from the lens mapping .",
    "explicitly , this can be done by the projection of @xmath90 into @xmath96 , thereby defining the matrix @xmath97    @xmath98      \\equiv \\widetilde{\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}}_i^j(s )      = \\widetilde{m}_i^ae_a^j.\\ ] ]    at the observer ( i.e. , at the apex of the cone ) , the connecting vectors @xmath90 vanish , so that @xmath99 , and , furthermore , in the limit as @xmath100 we have that    @xmath101    where @xmath2 is the identity matrix .",
    "this last result is quite important and comes from the fact that although the connecting vectors vanish at @xmath102 their angular size has been chosen to be unity .",
    "( at each value of @xmath68 close to the observer , each connecting vector subtends an arc from the observer s viewpoint .",
    "the connecting vector s arc is proportional to @xmath68 , therefore the angular size of the connecting vector at the observer is well defined , and equal to the derivative of the connecting vector with respect to @xmath68 . )",
