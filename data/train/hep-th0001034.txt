    "the renormalized vacuum stress - tensor for quantized fields at perfectly reflecting boundaries has been extensively studied , sufficiently so that they have made their way into various texts .",
    "fulling @xcite and birrell and davies are two examples .",
    "the perfect reflector enforces a dirichlet boundary condition that must be satisfied by the quantized field . for the case of the scalar or electromagnetic field with an infinite planar boundary ,",
    "the renormalized vacuum energy density for stationary observers has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a unitless constant of order unity , @xmath2 is the transverse distance from the planar boundary and @xmath3 is the dimension of the spacetime . the most notable property of the energy density is the divergence in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the divergence is not at all unexpected .",
    "the application of the dirichlet boundary condition fixes the value of the field at a specific point with no uncertainty in the position .",
    "thus the uncertainty of the conjugate momenta must be infinite , giving rise to the stress - tensor divergence .",
    "the precise mathematical origin of the divergence comes from the renormalization of the vacuum energy via the green s function .",
    "the argument is simply that the unrenormalized green s function is constructed such that it vanishes on the boundary . to renormalize the green s function ,",
    "the corresponding minkowski space green s function must be subtracted away .",
    "since this is divergent in the limit @xmath4 , the subtraction carried out for renormalization will leave behind a divergent part .",
    "when the vacuum energy is calculated from the renormalized green s function , it will diverge at @xmath5 also .",
    "the divergence of the vacuum energy density causes considerable consternation since the vacuum would contain an infinite amount of energy . in a self",
    "consistent theory of gravity , the back reaction of the vacuum energy on the spacetime would be considerable .",
    "yet we know from experience that metallic foils do not cause significant gravitational distortions around themselves .",
    "there are three resolutions to the problems : ( 1 ) replace the dirichlet boundary condition with something more realistic , which is the topic of this paper .",
    "( 2 ) add position uncertainty to the mirror ; this has been discussed by ford and svaiter .",
    "( 3 ) treat the entire problem quantum mechanically , which has been partially touched upon by barton and eberlein and more recently by helfer @xcite .    replacing the dirichlet boundary condition has to some degree been discussed by other authors .",
    "for example candelas @xcite has derived the asymptotic form of the vacuum energy density for the problem of two nondispersive dielectric half - spaces which are in contact with one another along a planar interface . more recently",
    "helfer and lang carried out similar calculations for a nondispersive dielectric to vacuum interface , with considerable interest placed upon the energy conditions in the vacuum region .",
    "this paper addresses the behavior of the stress - tensor for a quantized massless scalar field at a planar dielectric to vacuum interface where the index of refraction of the material varies as a function of frequency .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition is replaced with appropriate frequency dependent reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "the stress - tensor in the vacuum region is well behaved , even on the interface , and is largely independent of the functional dependence of the index of refraction .",
    "therefore the vacuum energy divergence is a result of the dirichlet boundary condition and not a generic feature of the field theory .",
    "it should be noted , however , that it is possible to get divergences for dielectric materials at the interface .",
    "the simplest example is a material with a constant index of refraction . in this case",
    ", the divergence comes about because part of the amplitude of the wave at every frequency still satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the existence of the divergence is intimately tied to the failure of specific integrals to exist . for example , in two dimensions , a divergence will occur if @xmath6 fails to exist . here",
    "@xmath7/\\left[n(\\omega ) + 1\\right]$ ] is the reflection coefficient for the modes at the interface , while @xmath8 is the index of refraction .",
    "there are similar integrals in four dimensions involving both the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "there are two remarkable results regarding frequency dependent dielectric models .",
    "first , all of the integrals that must be evaluated to find the components of the stress - tensor are self regularized , meaning that they all have a built in cutoff function that prevents ultraviolet divergences .",
    "for example , in two dimensions the energy density for a static observer is @xmath9 the only constraint placed on the index of refraction is for it to tend to unity as the frequency grows .",
    "thus the reflection coefficient plays the role of the regulator in the integral .",
    "similar results are found for the four - dimensional case as well , where there exists another integral for the evanescent modes which is regularized by the transmission coefficient .",
    "the other unique property , which we shall prove in general , is that the vacuum stress - tensor satisfies the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) for any moving geodesic observer , provided that the component of the observer s four velocity normal to the dielectric to vacuum interface is non - zero .",
    "this occurs even though the pointwise weak energy condition ( wec ) over some regions of the spacetime fails .",
    "the awec results from the riemann - lebesgue lemma applied to integrals of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d_result ] ) evaluated in the limit @xmath10 . in order to apply the lemma , it is required that conditions like ( [ eq : div_cond ] ) exist .",
    "a related result is that the energy density , integrated along the normal direction in a constant time hypersurface in the vacuum region , is a positive constant . in two dimensions",
    "the constant is zero and independent of the choice of model for the index of refraction .",
    "thus the spacetime always contains two regions , one where the vacuum energy is positive and another with equal negative energy . in four dimensions ,",
    "the constant is found by evaluating the integral @xmath11 d\\omega\\ ] ] for a specific choice of @xmath8 .",
    "we consider only the class of models for which @xmath12 for all frequencies .",
    "the function space for which the integral holds is obviously much larger , however this is beyond the focus of this paper .",
    "specific models are examined in this paper .",
    "the vacuum stress - tensor is found to asymptotically approach the form of the perfectly reflecting vacuum stress - tensor in the large distance limit .",
    "the price of removing the divergence of the stress - tensor by using a frequency dependent dielectric is the introduction of a vacuum energy near the surface with opposite sign .",
    "this simultaneously is the reason why the awec holds while the wec fails .",
    "we begin with the source free scalar wave equation in m+1 dimensional minkowski spacetime for a nondispersive material , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant",
    ". units of @xmath15 are being used throughout . a positive frequency plane wave solution to this equation in an infinite medium takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the modes can be normalized by defining the probability density for the wave equation and setting its integral over all space to unity .",
    "this leads to the normalization condition @xmath18 - \\left[\\partial_t f_{\\bf k}({\\bf x},t ) \\right ] f_{\\bf k'}^*({\\bf x},t ) \\right\\ } = \\delta^m ( { \\bf k}-{\\bf k'}).\\ ] ] thus the normalized plane wave mode takes the form @xmath19 ^{-1/2}e^{i(n{\\bf",
    "k}\\cdot{\\bf x}- \\omega t)}\\ ] ] the most general solution to the wave equation  ( [ eq : we_ordinary ] ) is then given as a mode function expansion , @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{eq : mode_expansion}\\ ] ] if @xmath21 is a classical solution to the wave equation , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fourier coefficients for the mode function expansion .",
    "the classical solution has the property that it can in general be written as @xmath24 this represents two traveling waves , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , that propagate in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions , respectively .",
    "each traveling wave maintains a constant spatial profile that is just translated along the direction of motion . when second quantization is applied the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 become the annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "next , consider wave propagation in a dispersive material .",
    "a scalar wave equation is needed which mimics the behavior of the electromagnetic field inside a dispersive material . in electromagnetism ,",
    "the wave equation is found by first fourier expanding the maxwell equations for harmonic time dependence . upon combining them , we find that each component of @xmath29 and @xmath30 must individually satisfy the helmholtz wave equation @xmath31\\phi({\\bf x},\\omega ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : we_helmholtz}\\ ] ] we will take this to be our dispersive wave equation .",
    "the mode functions which satisfy this equation are the same as given above with the replacement @xmath32 .",
    "the general solution @xmath21 is given as a mode function expansion in terms of the plane waves in the same form as ( [ eq : mode_expansion ] ) . to obtain this form",
    "we must impose the condition @xmath33 .",
    "however , even a simple resonance model ( anomalous dispersion ) for the dielectric as given in jackson @xcite leads to an index of refraction that does not satisfy this condition and would necessitate a more complicated quantum field theory .",
    "thus , we restrict @xmath8 to be real for simplicity .",
    "the physical interpretation of this condition is that the dielectric does not attenuate the wave propagating through it .",
    "it also excludes materials that may have any degree of conductivity . strictly speaking , causality and",
    "the kramers - kronig relations require any index of refraction to have a nonzero imaginary part .",
    "however , it is also possible to have broad frequency bands within which the real part is very large compared to the imaginary part .",
    "thus , for the models studied here , we are assuming that the dominant contribution to the energy density come from regions of the spectrum where @xmath34 .",
    "the general solution to the wave equation in the time domain no longer has the physical property of traveling waves as in the nondispersive material .",
    "for this case , each frequency component propagates with a different velocity , so the overall profile of the wave changes as it moves .",
    "now consider the example of two different dielectrics which have a planar interface at @xmath35 .",
    "to the left of the planar boundary the index of refraction will be denoted by @xmath36 . to the right of the boundary the index will be @xmath37 . in addition we will define the normal to the interface , @xmath38 .",
    "we allow a monochromatic plane wave to be incident on the interface from the left with a momentum @xmath39 . at the interface",
    "this incident wave is partly reflected back into the first medium and partly transmitted into the second medium . the reflected and transmitted waves have momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , and the three components of the wave are @xmath42 for electromagnetism , the plane wave modes at the boundary would have to satisfy the continuity of the transverse and perpendicular components of the fields across the interface .",
    "for the scalar field , the boundary conditions that will be applied are the continuity of @xmath21 and @xmath43 across the boundary .",
    "this leads to several relations :    1 .",
    "the continuity relations must hold at all times , therefore we must impose @xmath44 2 .",
    "all of the terms must have the same functional dependence on the surface of the interface , therefore @xmath45 taking the first two of these relations yields the law of reflection , @xmath46 .",
    "taking the first and third of these relations yields snell s law , @xmath47 .",
    "this allows us to solve for the components of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of the components of @xmath39 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 for @xmath52 , it is evident that @xmath53 will be imaginary for some set of incident momenta .",
    "these are the evanescent modes for which the incident wave undergoes total internal reflection . at the interface , all of the incident energy",
    "will be reflected while there exists an exponentially decaying tail in the medium that has a lower index of refraction .",
    "this theory of scalar dielectrics simulates all of the properties for wave reflection and transmission of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the result from the continuity relations are the reflection coefficient , @xmath54 and the transmission coefficient @xmath55 these relations are identical to the reflection and transmission coefficients for the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the mode functions can now be easily written down .",
    "there are two types , `` right - going '' which have @xmath56 and `` left - going '' which have @xmath57 .",
    "the right - going modes have the form @xmath58^{1/2 } } \\left\\ { \\theta(-x ) \\left [ e^{in_ik_1x_1 } + r_{rg } e^{-in_ik_1x_1}\\right]+ \\theta(x ) t_{rg } e^{i\\beta x_1 } \\right\\ } e^{in_i(k_2x_2+\\cdots + k_mx_m ) } e^{-i\\omega t } , \\label{eq : gen_right_mode}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the step function @xmath60 in addition the right - going reflection and transmission coefficients are @xmath61 and @xmath62 as defined above .",
    "the left going mode functions have a similar form , @xmath63^{1/2 } } \\left\\ { \\theta(-x ) t_{lg } e^{-i\\beta '",
    "x_1 } + \\theta(x ) \\left [ e^{in_tk_1x_1 } + r_{lg } e^{-in_tk_1x_1}\\right ] \\right\\ } e^{in_t(k_2x_2+\\cdots + k_mx_m)}e^{-i\\omega t } , \\label{eq : gen_left_mode}\\ ] ] with left - going reflection and transmission coefficients given by the interchange of @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in addition",
    ", the change in sign of the x - component of the momentum must be accounted for .",
    "thus the left - going reflection coefficient is @xmath64 and the transmission coefficient @xmath65 in addition , the new propagation constant is @xmath66    the normalization of the mode functions has been chosen such that the incident plane wave portion of each mode satisfies the orthogonality relation in an infinite medium .",
    "we are now prepared to begin our calculation of the vacuum stress - tensor outside of a frequency dependent dielectric material .",
    "we begin with a two - dimensional space with a frequency dependent index of refraction , @xmath67 , occupying half the spacetime and vacuum in the other half : @xmath68    there are two simplifications to the mode structure in two dimensions .",

    "( [ eq : refl_trans ] ) . this can be further reduced by making the change of variable in the first integral of @xmath80 , resulting in @xmath81    the stress - tensor in the vacuum region for arbitrary coupling is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coupling constant .",
    "the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the stress - tensor is found directly from the renormalized wightman function , @xmath84\\ ,   d^+_{\\mbox{\\tiny ren.}}(x , x ' ) .",
    "\\label{eq : tmunu_definition}\\ ] ] special care is taken in ( [ eq : tmunu_definition ] ) to ensure that the derivative operators are symmetric under interchange of the primed and unprimed variables .",
    "while this does not affect the calculation of the energy density , it has serious effects for the remaining components of the stress - tensor .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_ren ] ) yields @xmath85 similar calculations show the remaining components of the stress - tensor vanish , @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{eq:2d_stresstensor}\\ ] ] it is interesting that for @xmath87 , which is both the minimal and conformal case in two dimension , we have a vanishing stress - tensor . the form of the stress - tensor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d_stresstensor ] ) requires this because of the fact that the trace must vanish for conformal coupling .",
    "that is , the only way the stress - tensor can have this form and have a vanishing trace is for it to be identically zero for @xmath88 .",
    "before we look at specific examples , we examine the general behavior of the energy conditions .",
    "first we look at the integrated energy density ( total energy ) in a constant time hypersurface .",
    "we define the energy contained within a volume bounded on the left by the dielectric surface and on the right by an imaginary boundary at @xmath89 as @xmath90 this yields the interesting result that in the limit @xmath91 the total integrated energy is zero .",
    "this follows directly from the riemann - lebesgue lemma for the ordinary fourier integral .",
    "the requirement is that @xmath92 exist , which in general is true for models where we require @xmath93 .",
    "thus for the dielectric mirror , if the integral condition exists then there must be equal amounts of positive energy and negative energy .",
    "one can then infer that there is no vacuum energy divergence on the surface of the dielectric .",
    "it is interesting to note that the failure of the integral condition on the reflection coefficient corresponds to divergent vacuum energies , as demonstrated in the constant index of refraction example below .",
    "not much can be said about the wec other than it is necessarily violated at some time along a geodesic observer s worldline . only by specifying the reflection coefficient",
    "can any specific comments be made .",
    "however , it is remarkable that the awec can be proven in general .",
    "we begin with a geodesic observer whose world line is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 . the vacuum energy density integrated along",
    "this worldline is @xmath96,\\ ] ] which , as we have seen above , is zero for any observer that has @xmath97 .",
    "thus the awec is exactly satisfied .",
    "this is because such observers sweep through all of the energy distribution , encountering equal amounts of positive and negative energy along the way . for stationary observers , the awec may or may not be satisfied depending on the position at which the observers sit .",
    "let us consider the trivial case where @xmath98 for all frequencies .",
    "this makes the reflection coefficient , @xmath99 independent of frequency as well .",
    "thus the energy density is @xmath100 however this integral is not well defined , and requires a regularization scheme to be evaluated .",
    "one method is to introduce a cutoff function , carry out the now well defined integral , and then take the limit as the cutoff goes to one for all frequencies .",

    "the divergence is expected from the riemann - lebesgue lemma , as the integral of the reflection coefficient over all frequencies is divergent .",
    "this is identical , up to the factor of @xmath104 , to the known result for the perfectly reflecting mirror .",
    "actually the index of refraction in this case is only modifying the numerical coefficient of the functional form associated with the perfectly reflecting mirror .",
    "therefore , the replacement of the perfectly reflecting mirror with a dielectric results in the strength of the vacuum energy density being governed by the index of refraction .",
    "low indices yield very weak vacuum energy densities relative to the perfect reflector , while high indices yield appreciable fractions of the perfect reflector vacuum energy .    at one end of the spectrum for eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplest ] ) is that of the dielectric having an index of refraction of unity .",
    "this is the case of the vacuum spacetime everywhere . in this case",
    "the reflection coefficient vanishes and there is no vacuum energy density .",
    "this result is consistent with that expected from vacuum renormalization in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime .    at the other end of the spectrum",
    "is the perfect reflector , which is defined as the reflection coefficient being unity for all frequencies , @xmath105 .",
    "associated with this is an infinite index of refraction which is rather unphysical or at least ill defined .",
    "thus , it may be better the think of the perfect reflector to be the limit of the reflection coefficient going to one , @xmath106 this is the standard result for the vacuum energy in a two - dimensional spacetime with perfectly reflecting boundary conditions      the next example to consider is a dielectric which has a constant index of refraction up to a cutoff frequency @xmath107 and unity thereafter , @xmath108 if we insert this into eq .",

    "we see that the reflection coefficient is acting as the regulator to obtain finite results from what would otherwise be an ill defined energy density integral .",

    "there is a rich line of future topics to research with respect to the vacuum stress - tensor with more realistic boundary conditions .",
    "the most immediately interesting would be to carry out a similar analysis for the quantized electromagnetic field at a planar dispersive dielectric boundary .",
    "part of the foundation for this has already been carried out by helfer and lang .",
    "in addition , a more realistic model for the index of refraction should be considered that includes conductivity and attenuation .",
    "the study of curved surfaces should also yield interesting results .",
