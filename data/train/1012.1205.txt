    "the discovery of coexistence of ferromagnetism and bulk superconductivity in uranium - based intermetallic compounds , uge@xmath4  @xcite , urhge  @xcite , ucoge  @xcite has led to renewed interest in the interrelationship between ferromagnetism and superconductivity . in these itinerant ferromagnets ,",
    "the phase transition to superconductivity state occurs in the domain of stability of ferromagnetic phase , including sub - domains , where a considerable spontaneous ferromagnetic moment @xmath5 is present .",
    "this seems to be a general feature of ferromagnetic superconductors with spin - triplet ( @xmath6-wave ) electron pairing  @xcite ( see also reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "in such situation the thermodynamic properties near the phase transition line may differ from those known for the superconducting - to - normal metal transition .",
    "the basic thermodynamic properties of these systems are contained in their @xmath7 phase diagrams . according to the experiments  @xcite carried on the above mentioned compounds and zrzn@xmath4  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath7 diagrams exhibit several basic features , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , owing to a special treatment of sample surfaces , only a surface superconductivity has been proven in zrzn@xmath4 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the phase transition line @xmath8 , corresponding to the phase transition from normal ( paramagnetic ) state ( n ) to ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) is substantially above the lines referring to phase transition from fm phase to the phase of coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity ( in short , fs phase , or , fs ) .",
    "the exception is only very near to the critical pressure @xmath9 , where both ferromagnetism and superconductivity vanish and phase transition lines are close to each other .",
    "this picture reflects the real situation in the above mentioned compounds , for example , uge@xmath10 , where the @xmath11 at ambient pressure @xmath12 is of order @xmath13 k , whereas the maximal @xmath14 does not exceed @xmath15 k ; for uge@xmath4 , @xmath16 gpa .    moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the line @xmath17 of fm - fs phase transition may have two or more distinct shapes .",
    "beginning from the maximal ( critical ) pressure @xmath18 , this line may extend to all pressures @xmath19 , including the ambient pressure @xmath12 ; see the almost straight line containing the point 3 in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] by the curve which begins at @xmath20 , passes through the point 2 , and terminates at some pressure @xmath21 , where the superconductivity vanishes .",
    "these are two qualitatively different physical pictures : ( a ) when the superconductivity survives up to ambient pressure , and ( b ) when the superconducting states are possible only at relatively high pressure ( for uge@xmath4 , @xmath22 gpa ) .    within the general phenomenological theory of spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors  @xcite ,",
    "these different pictures are distinguished by simple mathematical conditions on the theory parameters  @xcite . therefore , there are both experimental and theoretical arguments to classify these superconductors in `` type i '' and `` type ii '' @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors , as proposed for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] above the respective @xmath17 lines .",
    "the tricritical points 1 , 2 and 3 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , at which the order of the phase transitions changes from second order ( solid lines ) to first order ( dashed lines ) are a quite reliable experimental fact and have already been theoretically explained  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the interaction between the superconducting and magnetic subsystems naturally generates a first order phase transition along the high - pressure part @xmath23 of the fm - fs phase transition . secondly , under certain circumstances , an additional @xmath24 term in the free energy may describe the experimentally observed first order phase transition along the high - pressure part of the n - fm line  @xcite .",

    ". it could be assumed , as in the most part of the experimental papers , that @xmath31 is the zero temperature point at which both lines @xmath11 and @xmath17 terminate .",
    "a second possibility is that these lines may join in a single ( n - fs ) phase transition line at some point @xmath32 above the absolute zero . in this second variant ,",
    "a direct n - fs phase transition occurs , although this option exists along a very small piece of n - fs phase transition line : from point @xmath33 to point @xmath32 .",
    "a third variant is related with the possible splitting of point @xmath33 , so that the n - fm line terminates at @xmath33 , whereas the fm - fs line terminates at another zero temperature point @xmath34 ; @xmath35 . in this case , the @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductor has three points of quantum ( zero temperature ) phase transitions  @xcite .    these and other possible shapes of @xmath7 phase diagrams are described within the framework of the general theory of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type  @xcite in an entire conformity with the experimental data  @xcite ; for reviews , see refs .",
    "the same theory has been confirmed by a microscopic derivation based on a microscopic hamiltonian including a spin - generalized bcs term and an additional heisenberg exchange term  @xcite .",
    "although the theory predicts correctly the shape of fm - fs phase transition line , the possible types of phase transitions , finite temperature and quantum multi - critical points  @xcite , some important features of @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors , in particular , the properties of the fm - fs phase transition , need a further investigation .",
    "the fm - fs phase transition in @xmath6-wave superconductors is remarkable for the circumstance that there the superconductivity appears in an environment of a strong ferromagnetic moment ( magnetization density ) @xmath5 .",
    "this certainly leads to a modification of the usual phase transition to superconducting state in conventional non - magnetic superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of the spontaneous ferromagnetic moment @xmath5 deeply below the ferromagnetic transition on the fluctuation properties in a close vicinity of the fm - fs phase transition above the fm - fs line .",
    "remember , that near the usual critical point of standard ( conventional ) superconductors , the fluctuating superconduction field @xmath36 creates an overall diamagnetic moment @xmath37 which , except for particular circumstances , depends on the external magnetic field @xmath38 .",
    "the numerous studies of the fluctuation diamagnetism in conventional superconductors , including various sample geometries [ three - dimensional ( 3d ) ( bulk ) , quasi-2d ( in short , q2d ; thin films ) , 1d ( wire ) , 0d ( small drop ) ] and layered structures , are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath39 denotes the effective dimension of the superconductor places in a three dimensional space ( @xmath40 ) ; note , that the effective dimension of the superconductor @xmath39 is often different from the space dimensionality @xmath41 .",
    "here we consider for the first time the diamagnetic properties of 3d and q2d @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors  diamagnetic moment @xmath42 and diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath43 .",
    "some of our preliminary results for 3d ( bulk ) superconductors have been recently published  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath43 and diamagnetic moment @xmath42 of @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors are dumped along the prevailing part of fm - fs phase transition line , in particular , at the second order phase transition line .",
    "so , our theoretical results predict that the singularities at critical points , typical for usual superconductors , do not exist at the second order phase transition line @xmath17 of @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the gl fluctuation hamiltonian of @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors in gaussian approximation for the fluctuation field @xmath36 of the superconducting order parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we consider temperature @xmath45 , where the statistical average @xmath46 of @xmath47 is equal to zero , namely , the field @xmath36 is a net fluctuation : @xmath48 .",
    "the gaussian approximation is the usual tool for study of basic properties of fluctuation diamagnetism  @xcite , and here we follow this approach as well as the notations in refs .",

    "we predict a dumping of the singularities of the diamagnetic moment and the diamagnetic susceptibility along the fm - fs phase transition line .",

    "here we work in a three dimensional space ( d=3 ) , where the geometry of superconductor body is chosen of two types : q2d ( thin film ) or 3d ( bulk ) ; hence , we may use the relation @xmath73 .",

    "note , that throughout this paper @xmath5 denotes the density of the magnetization , whereas the total magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase is given by @xmath82 .    in the present investigation",
    "we ignore the fluctuations of the field @xmath83 .",
    "this is justified by the fact , that @xmath84 for almost all variations of the pressure @xmath85 , except for a very narrow domain near the critical pressure @xmath18 , where the mean - field value @xmath86 of the magnetization tends to zero ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "remind , in this domain both n - fm and fm - fs phase transitions are of first order , and therefore strong fluctuations of @xmath5 could not be expected .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) have a key role in the description of thermodynamics and phase diagram of this type of ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "these terms describe the interaction between the normal ( non - superconducting ) electron fraction and the electron cooper pairs .",
    "while the @xmath68-term has the supporting role of ensuring a stability of phases at relatively large negative values of the parameter @xmath88 , the @xmath89-term has a key role in the phenomenon of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "the presence of this term ensures the theoretical description of real situation in @xmath6-wave ferromagnetic superconductors , in particular , a reliable description of the mentioned coexistence of phases .",
    "this is the term which triggers the superconductivity  @xcite ; for a more detailed discussion , see refs .",
    "this point is not trivial .",
    "although such  trigger  terms , where one of ordering fields is present by its first power and the second order parameter interacts by its second power , are well known , for example , in the theory of certain improper ferroelectrics  @xcite , here the symmetry of the @xmath89-term is very particular and leads to critical phenomena of essentially new universality class@xcite .",
    "note , that according to the symmetry analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , a @xmath89-term follows from the gradient anisotropy , which is typical for unconventional superconductors  @xcite .",
    "however , if the gradient anisotropy is the only source of creating such important term , the thermodynamics of these systems could not be described in compliance with the experimental data .",
    "this is so , because the exchange energy that creates the ferromagnetic order is of much bigger magnitude than the potential corresponding to the occurrence of fs .",
    "this argument is readily justified by the inequalities @xmath90 , which follow from the experimental data .",
    "therefore , the major contribution to the @xmath89-term and to the effective interaction parameter @xmath89 , comes from the interaction between the cooper pair fraction and the normal ( non - superconducting ) electrons of conduction electron bands of compounds rather than from the exchange interaction between cooper pairs in the superconducting sub - band only .",
    "so , contrary to the consideration in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the superconducting sub - band takes part in the description and @xmath89-term is a net product of the gradient anisotropy of @xmath6-wave cooper pairs , within the present general quasi - phenomenological approach , the interaction parameter @xmath89 includes both the inter - sub - band exchange interaction between the magnetic moments of cooper pairs and normal electrons , and the exchange interactions within the sub - band of cooper pairs , namely , between the cooper pairs themselves .",
    "obviously , the second type of interaction is much weaker , and can be safely ignored in many calculations .",
    "this point of view is supported by recent microscopic theories  @xcite .    as known , for the uranium - based compounds , all these remarkable phenomena are created by the @xmath91-electrons , whereas for zrzn@xmath4 the same phenomena might be ascribed to the behavior of the @xmath92-electrons .",
    "furthermore , within our approach one may extend the consideration beyond the itinerant ferromagnetism and take into account exchange effects on the conduction band electrons produced by localized spins , attached to atoms at the vertices of crystal lattice .",

    "<S> the scaling properties of the free energy , the diamagnetic moment , and the diamagnetic susceptibility above the phase transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the phase of coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with spin - triplet ( p - wave ) electron paring are considered . the crossover from weak to strong magnetic induction </S>",
    "<S> is described for both quasi-2d ( thin films ) and 3d ( bulk ) superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities of diamagnetic moment and diamagnetic susceptibility are dumped for large variations of the pressure and , hence , such singularities could hardly be observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained within gaussian approximation on the basis of general theory of ferromagnetic superconductors with p - wave electron pairing .    </S>",
