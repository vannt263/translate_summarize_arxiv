    "although there are many reports on the silicides and germanides of the 1 - 2 - 2 type structure , rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 compounds have not been investigated thoroughly .",
    "recently , we reported the anisotropic magnetic behaviour of ceag@xmath0ge@xmath0 single crystals  @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath4 of this compound as 4.6  k , thus removing the uncertainty about @xmath4 that existed in the literature . despite the fact that the ce - ions in ceag@xmath0ge@xmath0 possess a tetragonal site symmetry ,",
    "the ground state is a quartet , which was satisfactorily explained by the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility data . in continuation of our studies on ceag@xmath0ge@xmath0",
    ", we report in this paper on the crystal growth and anisotropic magnetic properties of rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 ( r = pr , nd and sm ) series of compounds .",
    "earlier studies on polycrystalline samples revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering in ndag@xmath0ge@xmath0 and in the case of prag@xmath0ge@xmath0 an unconfirmed magnetic ordering was reported at 12  k  @xcite .",
    "to further investigate these compounds for their anisotropic properties and to confirm the polycrystalline results , we have succeeded in growing the single crystals of rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "the incongruent melting nature of rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 ( r = pr , nd and sm ) precludes the single crystal growth from a direct melt .",
    "hence the rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 single crystals was grown by high temperature solution growth or the so called flux growth using a suitable solvent . since all the three constituent elements of rag@xmath0ge@xmath0",
    "have high melting points none of them can be used as a flux .",
    "the use of the fourth element as a flux may create the problem of forming a new phase . from the binary phase diagram of ag : ge and found that for a particular compostion of ag : ge in the ratio 75.5 : 24.5 there is an eutectic point at 651  @xmath5c .",
    "we have taken advantage of this eutectic composition and used it as a flux for the growth of rag@xmath0ge@xmath0 single crystals . the starting materials with 3n - ce ,",
    "5n - ag and 5n - ge were taken in the ratio 1 : 16.25 : 6.75 and placed in a high quality recrystallized alumina crucible .",
    "the alumina crucible was then subsequently sealed inside an evacuated quartz ampoule with a partial pressure of argon gas .",
    "the temperature of the furnace was raised to 1050  @xmath5c and held at this temperature for 48 hours in order to achieve proper homogenization .",
    "then , the temperature of the furnace was cooled down to the eutectic temperature of the binary flux ag : ge over a period of 3 weeks time and then rapidly cooled down to room temperature .",
    "the crystals which are now embedded in the solidified flux matrix were then removed by means of centrifuging which was done at 750  @xmath5c .",
    "the crystals were mostly platelet like and the typical size of the crystals obtained was 5  @xmath6  3  @xmath6  0.4  mm@xmath7 .",
    "the flat plane of the platelets corresponded to the ( 001 ) face of the crystal .",
    "the crystals were then oriented along the principal crystallographic directions by means of laue diffraction .",
    "well defined laue diffraction spots , corresponding to tetragonal symmetry pattern , indicated the good quality of single crystals .",
    "the crystals were then cut along the crystallographic directions using spark erosion cutting machine for the anisotropic magnetic measurements .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization measurements were performed in the temperature range 1.8 - 300  k and in magnetic fields up to 7  t along the two principal directions using a quantum design squid magnetometer ; high field magnetization measurements up to a field of 12  t were performed using a vibrating samle magnetomter ( vsm , oxford instruments ) .",
    "we have performed the powder x - ray diffraction , by crushing a few pieces of the single crystals to confirm the phase purity , as the crystals were grown from a very off - stoichiometric melt .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the representative powder x - ray diffraction for smag@xmath0ge@xmath0 together with the rietveld refinement .",
    "as can be seen from the figure the powder x - ray diffraction clearly reveals that the grown single crystals are single phase with no detectable traces of impurity phase . from the rietveld refinement the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type crystal structure of smag@xmath0ge@xmath0",
    "is confirmed with the rare earth occupying the @xmath8 site , the silver atom at the @xmath9 site , while the ge atom occupies the @xmath10 site with the @xmath11 parameter 0.61240 .",
    "the lattice constants thus estimated for smag@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xmath12  =  4.226(2 )    and @xmath13  =  11.045(8 )    with the reliability parameters @xmath14  =  10% and @xmath15  =  6.03  % .",
    "the lattice constants of prag@xmath0ge@xmath0 and ndag@xmath0ge@xmath0 match well with the previous reported values .",
    "furthermore , the energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edax ) on all the grown single crystals confirmed the 1 - 2 - 2 stoichiometry .",
