    "many applications of conformal field theory to statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics are related to the case of central charge @xmath1 .",
    "these applications include the statistical properties of critical geometrical models such as self - avoiding walks ( polymers ) or percolation , and the critical properties of non interacting @xmath14 dimensional disordered electronic systems  for instance , at the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "unfortunately , apart from some supergroup wzw models , the only well understood @xmath1 conformal field theory is the trivial , minimal and unitary , one , which contains no field but the identity .",
    "this corresponds to the existence of the trivial modular invariant partition function @xmath15 at @xmath1 , which is the result obtained by calculating the @xmath16 limit of the partition function of @xmath17 models or replicated disordered systems , or the @xmath18 limit of the q - state potts model ( see the recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "of course , these geometrical or disordered models have non trivial observables and critical exponents . but to observe them , one needs to understand what is happening `` outside '' the minimal trivial theory .",
    "while this issue was identified rather early  @xcite , it has proven surprisingly hard to control entirely .",
    "for instance , despite the huge progress realized in determining exponents for polymers and percolation , including rigorous work and connections with the sle formalism , there is to this day no agreement  let alone a consistent proposal  on what `` the '' proper conformal field theoretic description of say percolation clusters could be .",
    "this means in particular that very little is known about four point functions of geometrical observables in the bulk , despite the well established existence of measurable , universal quantities  @xcite .",
    "an aspect that got rather quickly understood is that the introduction of non trivial observables in say percolation forces one to consider a non unitary conformal field theory . while this is , on general grounds , a rather small price to pay for the description of observables which are most of the time non local in geometrical terms , the non - unitarity of the @xmath1 theory one is after is bound to be rather violent ( in contrast say to what happens in the lee ",
    "yang singularity ) , and leads in particular to the emergence of _ logarithmic features",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the adjective logarithmic refers to logarithmic dependence of the four point functions on the harmonic ratio , and to logarithmic terms in the opes .",
    "it does not imply that the field theory is in any way non local , but rather that the representations of the virasoro algebra which are involved in the description of the hilbert space of the theory are not fully reducible .",
    "in other words , the action of the dilatation operator @xmath19 is not always diagonalizable  @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be pretty hard to deal with logarithmic conformal field theories in general , and for many years the field has seen but little progress .",
    "the difficulty can be traced back to the complexity of virasoro algebra representation theory once the criterium of unitarity  or semi - simplicity  has been relaxed . in fact",
    ", the study of lcfts appears at first sight at least as difficult as the study of non semi - simple lie algebras , which is proverbially intricate indeed - and plagued most of the time by wilderness issues  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the study of wzw models on super groups  @xcite , the construction of restricted classes of indecomposable modules  @xcite , and the discovery of deep relations with the theory of associative algebras  @xcite have suggested that the problem , however hard , might not be impossible . in the last few years ,",
    "based in part on the analysis of lattice regularizations and of the deeper role played by quantum groups at roots of unity  @xcite , a lot has been understood about _ boundary _ lcfts .",
    "there are now reasonable conjectures about the general structure of virasoro indecomposable modules  @xcite and the fusion rules  @xcite , methods to determine the logarithmic couplings ( indecomposability parameters )  @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ , see the recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "an important role in these recent developments has been played by algebra , and concepts such as projective and tilting modules , which we review below .",
    "the case of _ bulk _ lcft remains however less understood .",
    "indecomposable features now occur not only within the chiral and antichiral sectors , but also in the way they are mixed , and there is evidence that the relationship between bulk and boundary lcfts is considerably more intricate than for unitary cfts @xcite .",
    "this paper is the fourth in a series  @xcite aimed at extending in the bulk case a lattice approach that was quite successful in the boundary case . rather than try to build a @xmath1 lcft abstractly",
    ", we focus on a well defined , local , lattice model , the @xmath0 heisenberg spin chain with alternating fundamental and conjugate fundamental representations .",
    "this chain is closely related  this is discussed in details below  with the properties of the _ hulls _ of percolation clusters .",
    "it is gapless , and can be argued to have a conformal invariant continuum limit indeed , which must have @xmath1 and be logarithmic . in a nutshell ,",
    "our strategy is to infer as many properties of this lcft as possible from our analysis of the lattice model .",
    "despite the fact that we focus on what is , after all , a very simple model , the endeavor remains highly difficult , and our results will be presented in a series of papers .",
    "one of the key ideas at the root of our strategy is that most indecomposable aspects of the lcft are already present on the lattice , in finite size , the algebra of local energy densities playing the role of a lattice version of the virasoro ( or product of left and right virasoro ) algebra . for the model",
    "we consider here ( as well as in our previous papers ) , this algebra is the temperley lieb algebra in the boundary case , and the jones temperley lieb algebra in the bulk case .",
    "a representation theoretic analysis of these algebras acting on our models is thus a perquisite to our understanding of the logarithmic properties of their continuum limit , and will occupy us in a great deal of the present paper .",
    "we start in section 2 by discussing the percolation problem and how it is related with conformal field theory .",
    "we then focus on properties of cluster boundaries - so called hulls .",
    "we recall how they are formulated in terms of an alternating @xmath0 super spin chain , which is expected to flow , in the continuum limit , to a super projective sigma model  @xcite .",
    "we also remind the reader of basic considerations about modular invariance , observables , and logarithmic features .",
    "section 3 provides reminders on the algebraic description of the @xmath0 spin chain , and some basic representation theoretic properties of the corresponding algebras @xmath20 and @xmath21 , both in the generic case , and in the special case @xmath22 of interest here .    in section 4 - which is the most important of this paper -",
    "we discuss the decomposition of the @xmath0 spin chain over indecomposable representations of @xmath23 .",
    "this involves several technical aspects .",
    "first , we make the crucial observation  discussed in more detail in appendix [ sec : tl - faith ]  that the @xmath0 spin chain provides a _ faithful _ representation of the algebra @xmath23 , in sharp contrast with the @xmath24 spin chain studied in  @xcite , where the corresponding representation was not faithful .",
    "the continuum limit of this @xmath24 spin chain is the ubiquitous @xmath25 symplectic fermions theory , a rather simple example of lcft , which is quite well understood now : accordingly , the indecomposable modules appearing in this spin chain are of very manageable form .",
    "we believe this is due to the non faithfulness , and the fact that the @xmath24 spin chain sees only a small part of the complexity of the full @xmath26 algebra : this complexity would be revealed in the @xmath27 spin chain , whose continuum limit , although also having @xmath25 , is considerable more involved than symplectic fermions .",
    "note that , in contrast with the periodic version , open @xmath24 and @xmath0 spin chains both provide faithful representations of the the ordinary temperley - lieb algebra , and the modules appearing in their continuum limit are of similar complexity .",
    "faithfulness gives us access to powerful tools in the analysis of the spin chain , especially when combined with the fact that @xmath28 is a cellular algebra .",
    "this requires manipulating several key concepts of the theory of associative algebras , which are explained in section [ sec : indecgen ] . in section [ sec : proj ] , we discuss the structure of projective modules over @xmath29 . in section [ sec :",
    "self dual ] , we discuss why , the spin chain admitting a non degenerate bilinear form , the representation of @xmath29 should be self - dual .",
    "this allows us to argue that the building blocks of our spin chains are a special kind of modules  called _ tilting _  which we introduce in section [ sec : tilt ] . in section [ secsl21resuts ]",
    ", we put all these ingredients together to obtain the decomposition of the spin chain .",
    "details on the structure of the tilting modules are provided in section [ sec : jcells ] , together with a discussion of the rank of jordan cells .",
    "a remarkable result is that arbitrarily large ranks for the hamiltonian are encountered as the length of the chain increases .",
    "we then turn to conformal field theory .",
    "this is considerably more involved than in the @xmath24 case since the @xmath0 spin chain is not free .",
    "to start , we focus in section [ sec : takecontlim ] on the generating functions of energy levels , which contain information about the left - right virasoro @xmath30 content in the scaling limit . while the chain is not solvable in the usual sense , these generating functions can be obtained by using known results for twisted xxz spin chains where the same standard modules appear : results for the @xmath0 chain itself are then obtained by using the algebraic analysis . in section [ sec : opconsimmod ] we then turn to the discussion of the operator content of simple jtl modules at @xmath1 . while in the case of the @xmath24 spin chain , simples of jtl led , in the scaling limit , to direct sums of simples of @xmath30",
    ", we find that it is not the case here .",
    "we provide the essential features of the left - right virasoro structure of simple jtl modules in the scaling limit , and reach in particular the conclusion that the size of jordan cells in the continuum theory can be even larger than those observed on the lattice .",
    "this is a new feature , compared with the boundary and @xmath24 cases .",
    "we also discuss the field content of our theory up to level @xmath31 . in section  [ sec : indextiltmod ] , we finally come to the discussion of the indecomposable content of the scaling limit of the tilting modules . we discuss in particular the identity or vacuum module , and the appearance of jordan cells for @xmath32 of arbitrarily large rank",
    ". the last section contains conclusions and directions for future work .",

    "first , for the lattice :    * the hilbert space of the spin chain decomposes onto tilting modules @xmath35 that are glueings of standard modules as in figs .",

    "[ secsl21resuts ] and an example in sec .",
    "[ sec : n6-ex ] , but are complicated and not particularly illuminating at this stage .",
    "they correspond to combinations of many representations of @xmath0 . for a given tilting",
    ", these multiplicities quickly stabilize as @xmath36 increases , and are the same in the scaling limit . *",
    "the structure of the tilting modules in terms of jtl simples can be obtained .",
    "it is also complicated , and depends on @xmath36 . but patterns as @xmath36 increases can easily be understood .",
    "the most detailed analysis is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt - n18 ] for the vacuum `` tilting '' module . *",
    "a consequence of the structure of the modules is the likely appearance of jordan cells of arbitrarily large size for the hamiltonian as @xmath36 increases .",
    "the analysis is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : jcells ] .",
    "second , in the scaling limit :    * in contrast with the @xmath24 case of the open case , simple representations of jtl do not become direct sum of simple representations of @xmath30 in the scaling limit .",
    "in particular , the scaling limit should exhibit jordan cells which are not present on the lattice .",

    "the complete description of the operator content ( including the multi hulls operators ) of our theory is in sec .",
    "[ sec : fields ] .",
    "several important conclusions follow , among which : * the identity field occurs with multiplicity one , and satisfies all the properties expected from a well - defined vacuum of a bulk field theory  in particular , it is invariant under translations .",
    "* there is a jordan cell of rank two for the fields in @xmath37 and @xmath38  the stress energy tensor has a single logarithmic partner , with indecomposability parameter @xmath39 .",
    "* there is a jordan cell of rank three for the field @xmath31 .",

    "finally , we stress that we adopt the convention that when a module is called ` indecomposable module ' , it is not irreducible .",
    "it is important to start by some generalities about geometrical models and conformal field theory . in the case of a critical statistical mechanic model which is defined locally in terms of spins and their interaction ,",
    "the definition of the conformal field theoretic limit is a priori obvious : what one needs to do is simply consider the scaling limit of local observables in order to obtain scaling fields @xcite . considering for instance the ising model ,",
    "the most natural such observables are the spin and the energy , which , together with the identity , constitute in fact the full primary operator content of what is usually considered as ` the ' cft for the ising model , which is simply the minimal , unitary @xmath55 cft .",
    "if one tries to apply the same approach to the problem of percolation , one is forced to recognize that the only local observable is the presence or absence of a bond on a given edge . in percolation",
    "however , edges are occupied independently of each other .",
    "there is thus no trivial scaling limit to this local observable , and the cft description of the problem is bound to be the trivial one , with only the identity field , and @xmath1 .",
    "the obvious point is that , in order to obtain interesting quantities in percolation , one needs to consider observables which are in fact non local in terms of the basic edges occupancy .",
    "part of the history of the field has been to recognize that these observables could also be described by a local field theory , via maneuvers which trade non - locality for non - unitarity - this will be discussed more below .",
    "the important point here is that , once non local observables are introduced , it is not at all clear where to stop , nor is it clear which set of such observables one can hope to describe within a consistent cft .    in percolation , one can first consider the connectivity of clusters , that is , define correlation functions via the probability that a given set of points belongs to the same cluster .",
    "the associated conformal weight is known to be @xmath56 , and can be formally reproduced using the kac formula with half integer labels : @xmath57 .",
    "three point functions have been studied recently , and found in numerical agreement with a continuation of the formula for liouville theory to the imaginary ( time like ) domain @xcite .",
    "nothing is known so far for the four point functions , and there is no evidence that the continuation of the liouville theory itself makes sense as a cft .",
    "meanwhile , one can consider refined connectivities , for instance via the probability that a set of points not only belongs to the same cluster , but are connected via two non intersecting paths on this cluster .",
    "the corresponding exponent ( related to the so called backbone fractal dimension ) is not known in closed form .",
    "it has been determined numerically to be @xmath58 by transfer matrix calculation .",
    "it can also be obtained , in principle , within the sle formalism and the numerical solution of a differential equation @xcite .    to add to the confusion , there are many more geometrical observables one can consider .",
    "of particular interest to us are the properties of percolation hulls .",
    "one can indeed consider the probability that two points belong to the _ boundary _ of the same cluster : the associated conformal weight is known to be @xmath59 .",
    "it is then easy to generalize this to observables @xmath60 where @xmath61 cluster boundaries come together , with the exponent @xmath62 @xcite .    when discussing the possible lcft description of a problem such as percolation , it is crucial to consider which set of observables one would like to describe , with the understanding that there is probably no single lcft encompassing them all , since different observables may well not be mutually local .",
    "attempts to define abstractly _ the _ fusion algebra of percolation without specifying which observables one is interested in appear as pure nonsense to us .",
    "although the cluster connectivity is the most natural observable to consider , we have unfortunately not been able to make much progress in its bulk conformal description , for technical reasons that we will discuss later . instead , this paper will focus mostly on attempts at constructing a lcft describing the properties of hulls , and in particular the observables @xmath60 . before getting into details",
    ", we would like to stress one more confusing fact : while in the bulk , the properties of the insides and hulls of clusters are profoundly different , they coincide near a boundary .",
    "this is simply because , near a boundary , a point which belongs to a cluster necessarily also belongs to its hull .",
    "hence , the set of possible geometrical observables in percolation is smaller in the boundary case than in the bulk case , a deep indication of the fact that , for lcfts , bulk and boundary are not as tightly related as for unitary , rational cfts @xcite .      as anticipated in the foregoing discussion",
    ", we will discuss in this paper the lcft description of the hulls of percolation cluster .",
    "the main reason for this is that the hulls , whose definition is initially non local , can be described by a fully local lattice model involving spins with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the drawback of this model is that it is non unitary  the boltzmann weights are not positive definite .",
    "the spins take values in representations of the superalgebra @xmath63 , and the model enjoys the corresponding ( target space ) supersymmetry .",
    "the first step to obtain our model is to trade the description of percolation in terms of clusters for a description in terms of loops .",
    "geometrically , these loops are obtained via the so called polygon decomposition of the medial lattice in fig .  [ medial - lat ] . for bond percolation on the square lattice - to which we restrict here -",
    "the loops live on another square lattice , which they cover entirely .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between loops and clusters , see fig .",
    "[ loop - cl ] .        at criticality ,",
    "occupied and empty edges occur with probability @xmath64 .",
    "this translates into the fact that all loop configurations are equiprobable , and that the loops must all be counted with a fugacity equal to one .",
    "the partition function of the model with doubly periodic boundary conditions is trivial , and can be taken to be @xmath15 with the proper normalizations .",
    "observe in particular that the operators @xmath60 have a natural interpretation in terms of @xmath61 loops joining two points , see fig .",
    ".        the next step is to consider the loops as feynman diagrams expressing contraction of what will turn out to be supergroup variables .",
    "the idea is that vertices of the medial lattice represent interactions , while the fugacity of the loops is obtained by a simple counting argument , the resulting weight being the number of bosonic minus the number of fermionic colors ( or degrees of freedom ) .    to give details ,",
    "it is more convenient to imagine calculating the partition function or some correlation function using a transfer matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "we consider for instance vertical propagation on our figures , and imagine that every edge carries a color @xmath65 which can be bosonic or fermionic .",
    "when two edges meet , either there is no interaction , or a contraction takes place .",
    "this is described by the two possible diagrams in fig .",
    "[ f - diag ]        and in the second case , the ` boltzmann weight ' is a sign factor @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is zero if the color is bosonic , and unity if the color is fermionic .",
    "it is easy to see that this reproduces the required statistics of the loops on the medial graph .",
    "the elementary interaction encoded by the second diagram in fig .",
    "[ f - diag ] corresponds to the action of a temperley ",
    "lieb algebra generator denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "first , we need to reformulate the problem slightly in order to make the underlying supersymmetry manifest .",
    "to do so , we associate with each edge of the medial lattice a @xmath69 graded vector space of dimension @xmath70 , that is , a bosonic ( _ resp . _ fermionic ) space of dimension @xmath71 ( _ resp . _ @xmath72 ) .",
    "we choose these vector spaces to _ alternate _ : we choose the fundamental @xmath73 of the lie superalgebra @xmath63 for even edges , and the dual @xmath74 on odd ones , see app .",
    "[ appsl21 ] for definitions .",
    "the transfer matrix then acts on the graded tensor product @xmath75 .",
    "the distinction between odd and even edges can be interpreted as a choice of _ orientation _ for the loops , see fig .",
    "[ fig_configperco ] .",
    "example of dense loop configuration obtained as an expansion of the partition function of supersymmetric vertex models .",
    "we also show the equivalent percolating clusters .",
    "the lattice consists of alternating arrows going up for @xmath76 odd and down for @xmath76 even , where @xmath77 corresponds to the horizontal ( space ) coordinate .",
    "the alternating @xmath78 representations correspond to a lattice orientation , conserved along each loop .",
    "the system has periodic boundary conditions in both spacial and imaginary time directions .",

    "notice the minus sign in the last anticommutator ; our convention is that the @xmath98 stands for the adjoint , this minus sign implies that the norm - square of any two states that are mapped onto each other by the action of a single @xmath94 or @xmath95 have opposite signs , and the `` hilbert '' space has an indefinite inner product ( with the respect to the adjoint operation ) .",
    "the space @xmath73 is now defined as the subspace of states that obey the `` one - particle per cite '' constraints @xmath99 the sums here and below are over @xmath100 , @xmath71 , and @xmath88 .",

    "this corresponds to the more general choice of elementary transfer matrices @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "it is in particular possible to chose a very anisotropic limit @xmath117 where the transfer matrix description is replaced by a hamiltonian description according to @xmath118 with @xmath119      the interpretation of the elementary vertices in terms of contractions suggests the simple algebraic nature of the interaction in our model . indeed , the elementary generators @xmath68 satisfy special relations , and provide in fact a representation of a well known algebra , the jones temperley lieb algebra .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basics : more details will be given in the next section .",
    "an important point is that , while we have restricted so far to @xmath63 , a more general @xmath120 model can be introduced , simply by allowing everywhere the labels @xmath121 now to run from @xmath72 to @xmath122 and @xmath123 from @xmath72 to @xmath124 . because each loop comes weighted with the super trace of the fundamental ( or dual fundamental )",

    "while this theory should have @xmath126 symmetry , it is not expected to be a wzw theory , as confirmed by the early analysis of the spectrum in  @xcite .",

    "the model as we define it on the lattice is perfectly local with periodic boundary conditions , and should lead , as it is , to a local field theory in the scaling limit .",
    "having introduced the supersymmetric formulation of the loop model , it is fair to ask what kind of observables we can now describe .",

    "similar reasonings show that the only diagrams that survive the sum are those where the lines in @xmath157 are never contracted as in  [ twoptfct](a ) but simply go through the system .",
    "this means in turn that the two points belong to the hull of the infinite percolation cluster .",
    "it is convenient to think of this after a conformal map onto the cylinder .",
    "two point functions are then evaluated in the transfer matrix language . by translation invariance",
    ", we see that the eigenvalue in the sector with @xmath158 through lines should then give the exponent @xmath159 , i.e. , zero spin and @xmath160 .",
    "it is also clear that lines connecting @xmath157 can obviously wind around the axis . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known , within the coulomb gas formalism , that primary fields can be obtained , for a given number of through lines , by inserting at either extremity of the cylinder additional charges , whose effect is to give an additional phase factor @xmath161 for every line going clockwise / counterclockwise like in fig .  [ winding ] .",

    "another important fact , which occurs only for the percolation model , is that it is impossible to define higher @xmath60 operators without some amount of ` mixing ' with lower ones .",
    "this is because of the fact that the object preventing contractions among three lines : @xmath166 while it obeys indeed @xmath167 can not be normalized to become a projector . in other words",

    "then , we have the equalities ( we recall the definition  ) @xmath893 while @xmath894 where the last sum in   is taken over all possible affine diagrams having a through - line connecting the @xmath109th site with the @xmath61th site . the last equality in   and inequality",

    "we note that some of the @xmath895 in the last sum in   are non - zero by our construction and the set of diagrams @xmath896 is in a bijection with planar diagrams from @xmath897 ; the bijection is obtained by cutting the annulus along the through line connecting the @xmath109th site with the @xmath61th one .",
    "we thus obtain that @xmath898 ( after multiplying it with translation operators by @xmath109 and @xmath61 sites on the right and left , respectively ) represents a planar diagram from @xmath899 on the ( @xmath124 copies of ) @xmath900-invariant spin - chain of length @xmath901 .",
