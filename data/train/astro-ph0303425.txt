    "we have also shown that in many cases the shapes of the troughs are almost entirely due to changes in the line of sight covering as a function of velocity , rather than to differences in optical depth ( arav et  al .",

    "the column densities inferred from the depths of the troughs are only lower limits .",
    "these results have led us to suspect that the current determination of column densities in seyfert outflows is highly uncertain .",
    "recently , arav , korista & de  kool ( 2002 ) have re - analyzed the _",
    "high resolution spectroscopic data of the intrinsic absorber in ngc  5548 and found that the  absorption column density in the main trough is at least four times larger than previously determined .",
    "furthermore , in the same paper it was shown that similar to the case in quasars , the shape of the main trough is almost entirely due to changes in covering fraction as a function of velocity , and is not due to varying column density as a function of velocity .",
    "an important new saturation diagnostic is available in the form of uv and x - ray absorption troughs that arise from the same ion .",
    "the relationship between the ionic column density ( @xmath5 ) and the optical depth ( @xmath6 ) of an absorption trough is given by ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in arav et al .",
    "1999a ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the wavelength and oscillator strength of the transition , respectively , and @xmath10 is the velocity in .",
    "using the apparent optical depth ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the residual intensity ) in equation ( 1 ) , a trough with the same @xmath13 yields fifty times higher @xmath5 for an x - ray line as compared to a uv line with the same @xmath9 , simply because its wavelength is fifty times smaller . in cases where",
    "the uv trough is saturated and its shape is determined by changes in covering fraction as a function of velocity , it is virtually impossible to distinguish between @xmath6 values above @xmath14 ( see arav , korista & de  kool 2002 ) . for equal oscillator strength , the x - ray trough of the same ion will have @xmath15 when the uv trough reaches @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray trough is sensitive to a much higher column density than the uv one and can provide a crucial saturation diagnostic for the uv troughs .    in this paper",
    "we compare the  column density inferred independently from uv and x - ray absorption features in the spectrum of ngc  5548 , and demonstrate the large discrepancy between the two values . the x - ray",
    "derived  column density is seven times larger than the uv one .",
    "since the x - ray determination is a robust lower limit , we conclude that the uv lines are much more saturated than originally inferred , and identify the uv analysis as the probable cause for this discrepancy .",
    "specifically , gaussian modeling can not account for a velocity dependent covering fraction , and more generally gaussian modeling is a poor representation for absorption associated with a dynamical outflow .",

    "the  absorption line at 22.0    is in fact a satellite to these he - like lines , and its importance for agn spectra was first recognized by pradhan ( 2001 ) .",
    "the line ( in fact an unresolved blend of the so - called @xmath19 and @xmath20 lines ) is caused by inner - shell photo - excitation of an  ion in the ground state to the 1s2p(@xmath21p)2s@xmath22p@xmath23 and 1s2p(@xmath21p)2s@xmath24p@xmath25 levels , respectively .",
    "we used atomic data for this transition as calculated by behar ( 2002 , in preparation ) .",

    "the equivalent width of this  trough is 40 @xmath28  ma , and therefore a _ lower limit _ for the associated column density is @xmath29 @xmath1 , where the error is directly associated with the signal - to - noise of the data . a detailed description of the fitting method used to extract this  column density value is given in steenbrugge et  al .

    "brotherton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) analyzed the _ fuse _ spectra of ngc  5548 in order to determine the  absorption column density from the  @xmath31031.93,1037.62 ( oscillator strength of 0.13 and 0.066 , respectively ; verner , verner & ferland 1996 ) .",
    "they used the program specfit ( kriss 1994 ) to fit the  spectral region using the following assumptions : approximating the intrinsic absorption as several components with gaussian distributions in optical depth that are permitted to partially cover the background source , where the optical depth ratio of the doublets is constrained to be 2:1 at all velocities .",
    "they have looked at two types of models .",
    "one where the outflow covers all the emission components ( continuum , broad emission lines , and narrow emission lines [ nels ] ) , and one where the flow does not cover the nels .",
    "since the model with un - covered nels gives higher @xmath34 estimates , we will concentrate on it , noting that our discussion is similarly applicable to the other model .",
    "the overall quality of the brotherton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) fit is very good ( see their fig .  3 ) and the statistical error quoted for the @xmath34 associated with each of the absorption components is mostly between 1020% ( their table 2 ) .",
    "we note though , that their model includes 43 free parameters : eight absorption gaussian with four free parameters each ( position , depth , width and covering fraction ) , three emission gaussians with three free parameters each ( position , hight and width ) , and two free parameters for the continuum ( flux and slope ) .",
    "although the goodness of the fit is impressive , it is not surprising given the number of free parameters involved .",
    "summing up the @xmath34 determinations in each component we obtain a total @xmath35 @xmath1 , where for a conservative error estimate we simply added the quoted individual errors .",
    "the total width of the  uv absorption complex is @xmath36 , which is consistent with the width of the  x - ray trough ( see above ) .",
    "we therefore possess two very different estimates for the absorption column density associated with the outflow in ngc  5548 . on the one hand",
    "the _ xmm_/rgs observation gives a lower limit @xmath37 @xmath1 , on the other hand a gaussian fitting of the _ fuse _ data yields @xmath35 @xmath1 .      at 22   the resolution element of the rgs instrument",
    "is roughly 700 . in order to obtain the deep  absorption trough seen in the data ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the absorbing material must therefore be spread over a similar velocity interval . an absorption component with a much narrower velocity width",
    "can not account for the x - ray trough even if its optical depth is very high .",
    "this narrow yet deep intrinsic trough will be transformed into a shallow trough of roughly 700  width by the line spread function of the instrument .",
    "brotherton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured fwhm@xmath38  for uv components 2 - 6 of the outflow .",
    "therefore , the high x - ray - inferred @xmath34 can not be hidden in only one , two , or three of these components even if they are highly saturated .",
    "uv components 0.5 and 1 are wider ( 350 and 280 , respectively ) . however , even combined , these components can not by themselves account for the x - ray - inferred @xmath34 .",
    "their combined width and shape are not enough to produce the observed x - ray trough even if we assume both components are highly saturated . we conclude that since the x - ray - inferred @xmath34 must be associated with the uv  kinematic components , at least half of these components have to be highly saturated to allow for the observed x - ray  absorption trough .",
    "a difference of 13 months exist between the _ fuse _ ( 2000 june 7 ) and _ xmm _ ( 2001 july 12 ) observations of ngc  5548 .",
    "it is therefore important to address the possibility that the order of magnitude difference in inferred @xmath34 is caused by temporal changes . in table 1",
    "we list the relevant uv and x - ray observations , including the continuum flux associated with each . based on the four available epochs of high - resolution uv spectroscopy of the object ,",
    "we conclude that strong variations in the shape and strength of the uv troughs over a year time - scale are unlikely .",
    "components 2 , 4 and 5 of the  trough ( following crenshaw & kraemer 1999 ) show only marginal changes in the three available epochs of high - resolution spectroscopy : _ hst_/ghrs spectrum taken in 1996 august 24 ( mathur , elvis & wilkes 1999 ) , _ hst_/stis observation from 1998 march 11 ( crenshaw & kraemer 1999 ) and _ hst_/stis observation from 2002 january 22 ( crenshaw et  al.in preparation ) .",
    "only components 1 and 3 ( which are blended to some extent ) show significant variation ( at the @xmath3950% level ) .",
    "the main  trough ( component 4 ) showed less than 10% changes in residual intensity between all three epochs .",
    "furthermore , component 4 in the  trough is almost identical in shape and depth to the main component in the  trough covered by the _ fuse _ observations ( see fig .  4 in arav et  al .",
    "such similarity argues for both small temporal variation in the troughs , as well as for a moderate to high degree of saturation in both the  and  troughs ( see discussion in arav et  al .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the shape of the main uv troughs in ngc  5548 change rather moderately on a time scale of 2  6 years .",
    "we note that if the uv troughs show non - black saturation , large column density changes are possible even when the absorption troughs do not change appreciably . however , uv analysis techniques ( gaussian modeling or otherwise ) have a limited dynamical range for inferring real optical depth ( see   3.3 ) . therefore",
    ", if the troughs shape did not change appreciably it is very difficult to deduce a real change in the  absorbing column density even if the level of saturation increased considerably .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray data suggest that dramatic @xmath34 changes are unlikely over a one year time scale .",
    "recently ( january 2002 ) a very long _ chandra _ letgs observation ( 340 ksec ) of ngc  5548 was obtained ( kaastra et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates that the detected trough is very similar to the one seen in the _",
    "xmm_/rgs observation .",
    "such occurrence suggests that an order of magnitude changes in the ew of the  x - ray trough between the _ fuse _ ( 2000 june 7 ) and _ xmm _ ( 2001 july 12 ) observations of ngc  5548 is unlikely .",
    "there is also an earlier epoch _ chandra _ letgs observation taken on december 1999 ( 86 ksec ; kaastra et  al .",
    "2000 ) and have now been reanalyzed using improved wavelength and effective area calibration by kaastra et  al .  (",
    "the s / n of this observation is significantly lower than the s / n of either the _ xmm _ data ( shown here ) , or the new _ chandra _ letgs observation . the  line is marginally detected ( fig .  3 in kaastra et  al .",
    "2000 ) , with a 1@xmath40 upper limit of @xmath41  @xmath1 , which is consistent with the _ xmm _ measurement .",
    "additional support for relatively small changes in the  x - ray trough on a year timescale comes from comparing total fluxes in the 2 - 10 kev bands .",
    "the x - ray flux dropped by roughly 50% between the two higher quality observations ( _ xmm _ and january 2002 _ chandra _ ) , yet the derived @xmath34 values are similar in both observations .",

    "the `` goodness '' of their fit is impressive .",
    "it is clear that a gaussian fitting algorithm can obtain a low @xmath53 fit between the data and a model spectrum .",
    "however , after obtaining a good fit the important question is how physically valid is the gaussian fitting process ?",
    "in other words , how well would the absorption column densities determined from gaussian components represent the actual column densities of the agn outflow ?",
    "gaussian fitting is a common analysis tool for spectral absorption features . in particularly it",
    "is used in ism and igm studies . in these environments a gaussian distribution of optical depth as a function of velocity seems physically plausible .",
    "this is because there is little dynamics involved , and therefore a thermal velocity distribution function yields a gaussian optical depth function ( even if `` turbulent '' broadening is invoked to explain the larger - than - thermal width ) .",
    "furthermore , for ism and igm the geometrical size of the absorption clouds are much larger than the emission sources they cover . therefore , the assumption that along our line of sight the absorber covers the emission source completely and uniformly is very reasonable .",
    "when these models are adapted to represent agn outflows two ingredients are added : a constant covering fraction to allow for partial line - of - sight - covering of the emission source , and a gaussian velocity width much larger than is found for ism and igm clouds ( in order to account for the width of the outflow s absorption features ) .",
    "the physical applicability of both ingredients is highly questionable : first , careful analysis of high - resolution , high s / n spectra of agn outflows reveals that the covering fraction is a strong function of velocity ( arav et  al .",
    "1999b ; de  kool et  al .",
    "2001 , gabel et al .",
    "in particular , this is also the situation we find for the  trough of ngc  5548 ( arav et  al .",
    "the strong dependence of the covering fraction upon velocity naturally undermines the constant covering fraction assumption .",
    "similarly , the large gaussian velocity width invoked to fit the outflows features is also problematic .",
    "for acceptable photoionization equilibria , clouds thermal widths are @xmath54 . for igm clouds a `` turbulent '' broadening",
    "is invoked to explain the larger - than - thermal width .",
    "however , the fwhm of this broadening is rather small ( typical values for the doppler parameter are @xmath55 16  46 ; sembach et al .",
    "2001 ) and is associated with motions on scales of hundreds of kpc . in contrast",
    "the fwhm of gaussian absorption components in the brotherton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) modeling reaches 350 and is associated with length scales of several parsecs at most .",
    "the larger fwhm and the much smaller length scales associated with the agn outflow weakens the physical plausibility of gaussian optical depth distribution as compared with the igm case .",
    "we conclude that there is little physical basis for modeling outflow troughs as gaussians clouds with a constant covering fraction .",
    "both the strong dependence of the covering fraction upon velocity and the large width of the outflow absorption features can be simply accounted for by appealing to the dynamical nature of the outflow . whereas it is reasonable to expect that a cloud will have a single covering factor (",
    "although , see de  kool et  al .",
    "2002 ) , this is not the situation for an outflow , where the covering factor can be a strong function of velocity .",
    "toy models which illustrate these kinematic / geometric effects are found in arav ( 1996 ) and arav et  al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "a similar picture arises in global models for the structure of agn ( elvis 2000 ; elvis 2001 ) .",
    "another important issue is the estimate of errors associated with the extraction of column densities from the absorption troughs .",
    "a formal statistical error from minimizing the @xmath53 between the data and a model spectrum based on a prescribed @xmath56 can greatly underestimate the real column density errors .",
    "for example , let us assume that at a given point the covering fraction is exactly 0.5 .",
    "in this case @xmath57 , where @xmath12 is the residual intensity and @xmath6 is the optical depth .",
    "assuming @xmath58 , we obtain from the above relationship @xmath59 .",
    "however , even a very small @xmath60 error will cause the following error in optical depth , @xmath61 , and of course if @xmath62 the formal error will be @xmath63 .",
    "an error of @xmath64 corresponds to a s / n=30 , which is rarely ( if ever ) achieved for high resolution uv spectroscopy of agn outflows .",
    "we therefore conclude that when the derived optical depth value is above 3 it is virtually impossible to set a meaningful positive error estimate . in such cases",
    "we should simply acknowledge that the derived optical depth value is _ a lower limit_.    one can argue that a proper error analysis based on minimizing @xmath53 should also yield the @xmath63 result . however , this is only correct for one resolution element .",
    "once we use a prescribed @xmath56 to fit a full trough , we lose our ability to distinguish between highly saturated regions in the trough and less saturated ones .",
    "the formal @xmath53 @xmath6 error will be obtained from averaging over the entire trough , whereas in some parts of the trough the actual error can be very large and dominate the derived column density error .",
    "this situation is accentuated when the shape of the trough is dominated by velocity dependent covering fraction and not by @xmath56 variations .",
    "for example , absorption component 4 in the brotherton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) modeling has a maximum optical depth of 7 in the blue doublet component ( extracted from the parameters in their table 2 and using their equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) , and therefore a maximum optical depth of 3.5 in the red doublet component . based on the analysis presented above , it is possible that the real optical depth in this absorption component is far larger .      for",
    "the relevant uv continuum is near 1030  , whereas that of the x - ray one is near 20  .",
    "it is plausible that the size and/or location of the emitting region at these wavelengths is quite different .",
    "it is possible that the outflow may cover different fractions of the continuum source , depending upon the wavelength .",
    "such differences will complicate the comparison between uv and x - ray determined absorption column density of the same ion .",
    "unfortunately , little is yet understood about the continuum emitting mechanism(s ) in agn .",
    "thus , we can not quantify the effects expected from the difference in the respective emitting regions .",
    "however , in the context of the current investigation the important question is whether size / location differences in the emitting regions can explain the discrepancy between the uv and x - ray inferred column densities .",
    "two combined characteristics of the ngc 5548  absorber leads us to conclude that such an outcome is not plausible .",
    "first , the velocity width and the overall depth of the  uv and x - ray absorption troughs are quite similar .",
    "second , we are comparing an apparent  x - ray column density ( derived from eq .",
    "( 1 ) using the apparent optical depth , i.e. , assuming no saturation ) with the inferred real uv  column density ( which should account for saturation effects ) .",
    "it is easy to hide a large column density in a saturated trough ( saturation in partially covering components or in unresolved components ) , but it is difficult to decrease the lower column density limit for a given trough s shape .",
    "for example , if the covering fraction of the x - ray trough is much larger than the uv one , then the apparent x - ray column is larger than the apparent uv column .",
    "however , in that case we should observe a much deeper x - ray trough compared with the uv one , which is not seen in the ngc 5548 data .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that different uv and x - ray emitting region geometry will allow the apparent x - ray column density to be an order of magnitude larger than the real uv column density .",
    "moreover , the striking kinematic similarity of the  uv trough and the x - ray troughs in ngc  3783 ( see fig .  2 in gabel et al .",
    "2003 ) strongly suggests that a large overlap exists between the x - ray and uv continuum emitting regions along our outflow - intersecting line of sight .",
    "we note though , that the argument can be turned around .",
    "a detailed comparison of x - ray and uv absorption troughs rising from the same ion may give us an important handle on the geometries of these different emitting regions .",
    "however , such a comparison necessitates higher quality x - ray data than those described here .",
    "the  data in the ngc  5548 _ fuse _ observation have a s / n@xmath6510 ( brotherton et  al .",
    "such limited s / n data do not allow a direct determination of the covering fraction and optical depth as a function of velocity .",
    "this forces the modeler to use some combination of physically weak assumptions , in descending order of `` weakness '' these are :    1 .",
    "the apparent optical depths are equal to the real ones .",
    "the optical depth is assigned a prescribed function ( normally a gaussian ) .",
    "each component of the flow is given a single covering fraction value , ignoring the possibility of velocity dependent covering .",
    "higher s / n observations are therefore needed in order avoid the practical necessity of using these assumptions .",
    "we point out that a careful solution of the optical depth and covering fraction as a function of velocity ( using doublet lines , e.g. , arav et al .",
