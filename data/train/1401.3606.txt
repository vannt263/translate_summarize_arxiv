    "for many applications it is of key relevance to tune and control the motion of artificial and biological microswimmers @xcite by external influences like confinement @xcite , solvent flow @xcite , or a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this can be exploited to construct motors and machines on the microscale @xcite and artificial muscles @xcite , to mention just a few examples . in particular , the motion of self - propelled particles in externally prescribed flow fields gives rise to significant changes in their swimming paths as shown by recent studies in planar couette @xcite and poiseuille flow geometry @xcite .",
    "astonishingly the motion of a microswimmer in a swirl has never been considered so far , although swirl flows occur quite naturally in many situations , including turbulence . here",
    "we address this problem and augment it by possible deformations of the particle that couple to the solvent flow . using a theoretical description from our earlier work @xcite , we derive equations of motion for a swimmer in a swirl . the setup of a swirl is similar to that of a scattering geometry and possesses therefore an analogy to the classical kepler and rutherford problem . in particular , one can discriminate between the two basic dynamic events of capturing and scattering : in the former , the swimmer is attracted by the swirl and can not escape from it afterwards , while in the latter it escapes from the eddy by its own self - propulsion .",
    "for human swimmers at high reynolds numbers , it is important to propose a strategy to escape a swirl .",
    "we address this problem at low reynolds numbers in an analogous way .",
    "in fact , the two events of capturing , which possibly leads to death , and scattering , corresponding to a successful escape and survival , depend on the impact parameter and the relative orientation of the swimmer with respect to the flow direction .",
    "in order to discriminate between these two results , we perform a theoretical stability analysis as well as a numerical solution of the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "our predictions can be tested for deformable swimmers in prescribed vortex flows .",
    "experimental realizations are given by deformable droplets on fluid interfaces propelling due to chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the vortex flow profile is of high practical relevance and experimentally easily accessible . in practice ,",
    "a magnetic stir bar at the bottom of an artificial water tank is enough to steadily maintain it .",
    "furthermore , it does not require periodic boundary conditions , which are in principle necessary for the typically studied examples of planar couette or linear shear flow . nevertheless , we are not aware of any previous investigation of this setup in the presence of active particles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the time - evolution equations of a deformable microswimmer in a swirl flow are described .",

    "in the following , we introduce the model equations for an active deformable microswimmer in a swirl flow .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional environment and denote the fluid flow field as @xmath0 .",
    "our simple vortex flow ( swirl ) is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 sets the strength of the vortex .",
    "it describes a rotational flow around a swirl center .",
    "naturally , the swirl center defines the origin of our coordinate frame .",
    "a flow potential exists for this type of fluid flow such that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 , which implies that the fluid flow does not contain a local rotational contribution .",
    "this swirl flow can easily be realized in an experimental setup .",
    "surface swimmers on a fluid provide a reasonable realization of our two - dimensional considerations .",
    "for a simple swimmer , two basic kinds of activity can generally be distinguished : a spontaneous translational motion ( self - propulsion ) and a spontaneous rotation ( spinning motion ) .",
    "the impact of spontaneous active rotations has been investigated in detail @xcite . here , for simplicity , we take into consideration only a spontaneous translational motion , i.e. , self - propulsion .",

    ", the coefficient @xmath16 would generally be negative for passive particles and describe the friction with the fluid environment . for active swimmers , however ,",

    "( [ eq : v ] ) , a nonvanishing relative velocity @xmath18 of active swimming becomes possible .",
    "the direction of @xmath14 is not fixed and results from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this is a key ingredient to active self - propelled motion in the absence of external fields .",
    "an analogous approach had already been established by the early continuum descriptions of flocks of active particles @xcite .",
    "next , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) with the coefficient @xmath19 includes the leading - order coupling of the velocity to deformations @xmath20 of the swimmer .",
    "the influence of this term on the swimmer behavior will be addressed below together with its counterpart in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) , the term with the coefficient @xmath21 .    here",
    "we take into account only elliptic deformations of the swimmer in a lowest - order approach . as a consequence ,",
    "the tensor @xmath20 is of second rank , symmetric , and traceless .",
    "it can be directly related to the second fourier mode of the shape changes of a deformable particle @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is of the same form as the order parameter used to characterize the state of nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "its components are parameterized as @xmath22 here @xmath23 characterizes the degree of elliptic deformation , while @xmath24 measures the orientation of the symmetry axis of elliptic deformation when viewed from the laboratory frame .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] for the assignment of the angles @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we consider the time evolution of the deformations @xmath20 as described by eq .",

    "first , we set @xmath27 in the leading term on the right - hand side .",
    "this implies that we do not include active deformations of the swimmer .",
    "its shape rather tends to relax back to the undeformed state when the other contributions are ignored .",
    "thus in the limit of @xmath28 we obtain @xmath29 and our equations apply to the case of a rigid spherical swimmer .",
    "next , by the contribution with the coefficient @xmath21 , we include the leading - order coupling to the relative velocity .",
    "to maintain the requirements on the structure of @xmath20 , i.e. , that this tensor be symmetric and traceless , the coupling term is constructed in a symmetric and traceless form as well .",
    "we come back to the influence of this term below .",

    "( [ eq : s ] ) to keep the traceless nature of @xmath20 .",
    "a corresponding term is already present in the characterization of passive deformable objects @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath32 determines how strongly the elongational part of the fluid flow stretches the deformable swimmer .",
    "our set of equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x])([eq : s ] ) was derived from symmetry arguments and not on the basis of a specific microscopic model .",
    "this serves to keep the description as general as possible",
    ". only the leading - order coupling terms between velocity and deformation as well as to the external flow field are included .",
    "the description reduces to known models in several limiting cases such as for a passive deformable particle in shear flow @xcite , an active rigid particle in shear flow @xcite , and an active deformable particle in a quiescent environment @xcite .",
    "not including any external flow field , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x])([eq : s ] ) were derived theoretically for an isolated deformable domain in a reaction - diffusion system @xcite .",

    "their impact has been studied in detail in the absence of external flow fields @xcite .",
    "they in general imply that propulsion can lead to shape changes , and in turn deformations can influence the propulsion direction and the swimming speed",
    ". one important consequence of these terms is that increased deformations lead to curved trajectories . without the fluid flow , a bifurcation from straight to circular motion",

    "the two directions tend to be parallel to each other ( `` parallel case '' ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally a corresponding example system is given by a deformable droplet self - propelling on a fluid interface due to a chemical reaction @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical investigation @xcite suggests that such a system is a pusher in the perpendicular case and a puller in the parallel case . @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath21 are thus determined by the relation between propulsion and deformation that in turn results from the microscopic propulsion mechanism . for an explicit calculation of these coefficients in a microscopic model of self - propelled droplets",
    "see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the swirl flow in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) features a rotational symmetry .",

    "we refer to this situation as _ passive circular motion_.    if the radius @xmath44 of the circle is below a certain value , @xmath45 , all passive circular motions @xmath39 are marginally stable . above this value , @xmath46 ,",

    ", we use stokes relation and einstein s relation , and we further assume that the thermal noise for active swimmers is of the same magnitude as in the passive case . we then can attribute the thermal noise of strength @xmath120 to a spherical self - propelled droplet of a few millimeters in size in an aqueous solution . at noise intensities @xmath121 ,",
    "corresponding to a swimmer size around one millimeter , the capturing event is still well defined as a function of the impact parameter @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast to that , at a noise strength @xmath122 , the stochastic fluctuations smear out the statistics and a capturing event is not well - defined any more .",
    "this intensity of thermal noise identifies a spherical object of a few hundred micrometers in size , which comes into the range of large microorganisms .",
    "the reason for the fading of the capturing event in the latter case is not related to the captured states becoming unstable , however .",
    "this can be seen by considering captured particles on their active circular motion around the vortex center and exposing them to the stochastic force .",
    "we measured the probability @xmath118 of finding the particles still captured after a certain number @xmath119 of circulations around the swirl . in practice",
    ", we checked whether they are still within a certain threshold distance from the vortex center .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_perpendicular](b ) .",
    "it is obvious that the swimmers can escape from the captured states only at much higher noise intensities than the ones referred to in fig .",

    "the fading probabilities of getting captured at higher noise strengths @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_perpendicular](a ) therefore do not imply that the captured states become unstable .",
    "rather , due to the noise , the swimmers increasingly depart from their deterministic trajectories towards the swirl center and do not hit the vortex any more .",
    "this can easily be cured by placing the swimmers closer to the vortex center in a modified initial condition . therefore , despite thermal noise , the microswimmers should show the predicted dynamics .",
    "in summary , we studied the dynamic behavior of a deformable microswimmer in a swirl flow . to our knowledge",
    "this geometry has not been investigated before for active microswimmers , although it is a setup of high practical relevance and straightforward to be realized in an experiment . within our framework , we distinguished between two types of swimmers : those that tend to elongate perpendicularly to their propulsion direction and those that prefer a parallel configuration . considering droplets propelling due to chemical reactions , a recent theoretical study suggests that the first ones can be classified as pushers while the second ones are pullers @xcite .    for the different types of swimmers",
    ", we found different bound states in the swirl .",
    "passive deformable swimmers show _ passive circular motion _ , where not all radii are stable depending on the friction with the fluid environment .",
    "active deformable swimmers at lower strength of self - propulsion and in the perpendicular configuration either escape from the swirl , or they feature an _ active circular motion _ of one stable radius determined by their activity . in the parallel configuration they always escape from the swirl . beyond a threshold for the strength of self - propulsion , the swimmers could not escape any more but showed an _ active circular motion _ , a _ lunar - type motion _ , or a _ multi - circular motion _ , depending on the swimmer configuration and on the initial conditions .",
    "second , in analogy to classical scattering experiments , we investigated how active swimmers interact with the swirl when they are heading towards the vortex from far away in a straight motion . for active swimmers of perpendicular configuration we observed that they were _ captured _ by the swirl on a trajectory of active circular motion at intermediate impact parameters .",
    "this capturing event is _ reentrant _ as a function of the strength of self - propulsion . for other impact parameters",
    "the swimmer is _ scattered _ and manages to escape .",
    "the scattering event is _ reentrant _ as a function of the impact parameter and _ twofold reentrant _ as a function of the strength of self - propulsion .",
    "in contrast to that , we observed that active swimmers in the parallel configuration are _",
    "always scattered_. thus , to design an active deformable swimmer that is not captured by swirls , the parallel configuration should be preferred and the strength of self - propulsion should be weak enough to avoid circular motions .",
    "nevertheless , scattered swimmers may perform interim loops around the vortex center at very close distances , possibly changing the side that they expose to the vortex center .",
    "additional thermal noise was not found to qualitatively alter the capturing dynamics in an appropriately chosen setup .",
    "the swirl flow geometry is of high practical relevance and straightforward to be realized in an experiment . in principle , a magnetic stir bar on the bottom of a water tank is enough to create the vortex flow .",
    "self - driven droplets on the water surface constitute appropriate deformable active swimmers @xcite that propel in a quasi - two - dimensional environment",
    ". therefore they should immediately allow us to test and verify our predictions in an actual experimental setup .",
    "this system should be easier to realize than the typically investigated flow profiles of linear shear .",
    "apart from that , also on the theoretical side several questions directly follow from our study .",
    "most notably , it will be worthwhile also to analyze the swimmer behavior in flow fields of non - vanishing local vorticity or even in turbulent flows .",
    "on the one hand , hydrodynamically enforced trapping and particle segregation can occur for passive particles in a vorticity flow @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", microswimmers were observed to create turbulence - like flows even by themselves in dense suspensions @xcite .",
    "apart from that , it has been reported that active swimmers not only self - propel but also actively rotate @xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting to see how the active rotations interact with the rotational component of the flow fields and what their impact is on the dynamics .",
