    "the study of the oxygen isotopic chain deserves special attention since the neutron drip line was shown to be located at a = 24  @xcite . thus rapid structural changes are expected as we move from @xmath1o towards its neutron - rich exotic isotopes .",
    "several theoretical and experimental endeavors also indicate n = 14 and n = 16 shell closures  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is opportunity to track neutron and proton contributions of the 2@xmath2 state as the neutron drip line is approached  @xcite .",
    "proton scattering is widely used as a means to study both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of nuclear structure  @xcite .",
    "a suitable realistic effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is also needed in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "a folding model approach is followed in this study of proton scattering from @xmath0o at 43 , 43 , 46.6a mev respectively , measured at ganil  @xcite . the earlier p-@xmath3o differential cross section and analyzing powers for the ground state and 2@xmath4 level at 24.5a mev incident energy  @xcite are also included in the analysis .",
    "the folding model , which relates the density profile of the nucleus with the scattering cross sections is powerful tool for analyzing nucleus - nucleus scattering data at a few tens of mev / nucleon  @xcite . thus it is very appropriate for studying nuclei with extended density distributions . it should be noted that the same formalism is being followed to provide description of radioactivity , @xmath5 and heavy ion scattering in a double folding model as well as nuclear matter and p - elastic / inelastic scattering in a single folding model  @xcite",
    "in a single folding calculation the nucleon - nucleus potential is obtained by using the density distribution of the nucleus and the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction  @xcite as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is density of the nucleus at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the effective interaction between two nucleons at the sites @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "the finite range m3y effective interaction @xmath9  @xcite , is based upon a realistic g - matrix and was constructed in an oscillator basis .",
    "effectively it is an average over a range of nuclear densities as well as energies and thereby has no explicit dependence on density or energy .",
    "the only rather weak energy dependent effect is contained in an approximate treatment of single - nucleon knock - on exchange . at lower energies ,",
    "the density and energy averages are adequate for the real part of the heavy ion optical potentials . for scattering at higher energies ,",
    "explicit density dependence was introduced  @xcite .",
    "the present calculations use this density dependent m3y ( ddm3y ) effective nn interaction with an added zero - range pseudo potential given by ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is incident energy and    @xmath13    the zero - range pseudo - potential  @xcite represents the single - nucleon exchange term and is given by    @xmath14    while the density dependent part is taken to be @xcite    @xmath15    taking care of the higher order exchange and pauli blocking effects . here",
    "@xmath16 is the spherical ground state density of the nucleus .",
    "the constants of this interaction @xmath17 and @xmath18 when used in single folding model description , are determined by nuclear matter calculations  @xcite as 2.07 and 1.62 @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the neutron and proton matter densities were calculated in the continuum skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach and the microscopic transition densities were obtained within the framework of the continuum qrpa ( quasi - particle random phase approximation ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "1 shows the hfb ground state densities and qrpa transition densities for the 2@xmath4 states of @xmath0o . in both hfb and qrpa calculations ,",
    "all quasiparticle states below 60 mev are considered , allowing to take into account seven oscillator shells .    in the present analysis both the real ( @xmath20 ) and volume imaginary ( @xmath21 ) parts of the folded nuclear potentials are assumed to have the same shape  @xcite , i.e. @xmath22 = ( @xmath23 + @xmath24)@xmath25(@xmath26 ) where , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the renormalization factors for real and imaginary parts respectively , obtained by fitting the elastic scattering data .",
    "in addition to real and volume imaginary folded potentials , best fit phenomenological surface imaginary and spin - orbit potentials ( 4@xmath29= 23.08 , @xmath30= 1.17 , @xmath31= 0.69 , 4@xmath32= 23.60 , @xmath33= 0.88 , @xmath34= 0.63 ) are also used as in  @xcite .",
    "the parameters are same for all targets , with volume integral per nucleon of the surface imaginary potential for @xmath0o as 176.5 , 168.8 and 162.2 mev @xmath35 respectively . in  @xcite",
    ", the first diffraction minimum of the elastic scattering on @xmath36o around @xmath37 = 35@xmath38 shows a discrepancy of about 50@xmath39 with both phenomenological and microscopic calculations .",
    "it was thought that improvement of the imaginary part of the optical potential is required for these unstable nuclei .",
    "the more recent work  @xcite as well as the present formalism using a ddm3y interaction satisfactorily explains the data .",
    "the nucleon - nucleus optical potentials from elastic scattering best fits are subsequently used to generate the distorted waves for inelastic scattering amplitude calculations in dwba formalism ( fig .",
    "the calculations are performed using the code dwuck4  @xcite .",
    "initially , the conventional approach of collective vibrational model ( @xmath40 ) is used to obtain the transition form factors .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath41 are determined by fitting the inelastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "table 1 gives the renormalization factors , @xmath41 values , @xmath42/n for the folding model analysis .",
    "compared to earlier results  @xcite , the present @xmath41 value of 0.33 for @xmath3o 2@xmath4 agrees well while giving a slightly lower value of 0.46 for @xmath36o 2@xmath4 state . the high @xmath41 value of 0.50 for @xmath36o 2@xmath4 state was explained  @xcite as neutrons playing a disproportionately large role in the excitation .",
    "the present calculations give the lowest @xmath41 value of 0.26 for @xmath43o .",
    "a more microscopic approach is useful to investigate low - lying excitations in exotic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "calculations have also been performed ( fig .",
    "2 ) with form factors using qrpa transition densities .",
    "it may be noted that two probes namely ( p , p ) and @xmath44 are required to derive proton and neutron contributions .",
    "the adopted values  @xcite for the reduced quadrupole transition rate @xmath44 from the ground state to 2@xmath4 state for @xmath0o are used in this work and given in table 2 .",
    "though the energy of the 2@xmath4 state in @xmath36o is lower than @xmath3o , the @xmath44 value is considerably lower indicating a lesser degree of collectivity for @xmath36o  @xcite .    in this context , the neutron / proton matrix element is defined as , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the neutron ( proton ) transition density between ground state and excited state @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as in  @xcite ,",
    "the proton transition density is first normalized ( if required ) to match with the experimental @xmath44 value .",
    "then the magnitude of the neutron transition density is adjusted to give best fits to the inelastic scattering data . in an earlier folding model approach  @xcite",
    "substantially high values of @xmath49 of 1.80 and 4.25 for @xmath3o and @xmath36o respectively were reported .",
    "the results of the present work are shown in table 2 along with experimental @xmath49 value  @xcite .",
    "though the @xmath44 value is lower , the present results on @xmath49 of @xmath36o confirms its strong neutron contribution .",
    "thus , for both @xmath3o and @xmath43o the @xmath49 ( 0@xmath2 @xmath50 2@xmath2 ) values of 1.12 and 2.00 are close to the @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the neutron and proton numbers ) values of 1.25 and 1.75 while for @xmath36o the @xmath49 ( 0@xmath2 @xmath50 2@xmath2 ) value of 3.34 is high as compared to the @xmath51 value of 1.50 .    in fig .",
    "3 , the elastic cross sections for p + @xmath0o scattering have been plotted as ratios to the rutherford cross sections ( scaled by a factor of 10 for clarity ) . using the code chuck3  @xcite , the coupled channel ( cc ) calculations of the inelastic scattering cross sections",
    "are also shown in fig 3 . only ground state and the first excited state have been considered and coupling is both ways .",
    "the dwba and cc calculations using same form factors are nearly identical as can also be ascertained by the moderately high values of @xmath27 from elastic scattering . using different collective form factors give slightly different results .",
    "the dotted lines in fig . 3 correspond to cc calculations using present collective form factors .",
    "the dashed lines in fig . 3 correspond to form factors obtained from legendre expansion of volume and surface wood - saxon potential , where monopole part of the potential is extracted .",
    "it may be noted that the spin - orbit coupling in the present study is treated phenomenologically from the best fit optical potential parameters , since a phenomenological thomas form for the spin - orbit potential gives a good description of the elastic data while the target excitation is simply represented by a nuclear transition density .",
    "the central transition potential explains the inelastic cross section reasonably well , giving a dominant contribution while the transition spin - orbit potential has only a minor effect  @xcite .",
    "the vector analyzing powers for @xmath3o(p , p ) scattering at e= 24.5a mev  @xcite are also compared with the calculations and the results are shown in fig .",
    "5 gives the predictions of analyzing powers for proton scattering from @xmath0o nuclei at 43 , 43 and 46.6a mev respectively , both for the ground state as well as the 2@xmath4 excited states .",
    "the calculations are done on the same footing as the cross sections with hfb and qrpa approaches . for the ground state , while the 43a mev p + @xmath54o angular distributions are nearly same , the p + @xmath43o analyzing power at slightly different energy of 46.6a mev is marginally different . for the excited state",
    "all of them are nearly identical .",
    "it would indeed be interesting to observe how well the calculations agree with any future experimental data on p + @xmath0o analyzing powers .",
    "in this work , a single folding model approach is followed to study the cross sections as well as analyzing powers of proton scattering from neutron rich oxygen isotopes . in the dwba formalism ,",
    "both collective - model ( deforming the optical potential ) as well as microscopic calculations using hfb and qrpa densities with the ddm3y effective interaction are carried out .",
    "the present calculations satisfactorily reproduce the experimental data showing a high neutron contribution to the excited state and a large @xmath41 value for @xmath36o as compared to @xmath55o . coupled",
    "channel calculations of the inelastic scattering cross sections reflect insignificant coupling .",
    "predictions of the analyzing powers for ground state and excited state for proton scattering on the oxygen isotopes at the same energies are given .",
    "with the availability of a larger data set on unstable nuclei , similar microscopic studies would be immensely helpful for nuclear structure and reaction studies .",
