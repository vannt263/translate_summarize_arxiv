    "when the temperature @xmath5 is high compared with the typical momentum scale but well below the planck scale , all the n - graviton thermal green functions can be computed in the one - loop approximation using the hard thermal loop expansion .",
    "there have been many investigations where this approach has been employed @xcite . an important property which is now well established is the gauge invariance of the leading high temperature contributions of all n - graviton thermal green functions .",
    "the explicit from of these contributions can be obtained using the equivalence which exists between the formalism of boltzmann transport equation and the high temperature limit of the thermal green functions in field theory@xcite . using this approach ( which is explicitly gauge invariant )",
    "one can easily show that the leading part of all n - point one - loop thermal green functions is proportional to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these results have also been obtained by standard feynman diagrammatic calculation in the feynman - dedonder gauge for the one- and two - graviton functions @xcite as well as for the three - graviton function @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting physical applications of the one- and two - graviton functions is the study of the dispersion relations@xcite which follow from linear response theory@xcite . since the relevant physical quantities are obtained from the _ poles _ of the propagator , it is important to verify the gauge independence of this procedure .",
    "while this is automatically fulfilled by the leading high temperature contributions , the inherently gauge dependent _ sub - leading contributions _ to the thermal green functions require a more detailed investigation .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the case the yang - mills theory where it is known that a gauge independent set of dispersion relations can be obtained from the gauge dependent thermal two - gluon function @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , in contrast with the case of the yang - mills theory , a gauge independence proof of the dispersion relations in quantum gravity beyond the leading order is still missing .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate this problem in the case of gravity using the standard feynman diagrammatic approach .",
    "we will compute the 1- and 2-graviton functions up to sub - leading contributions , in a class of general gauges .",
    "( some intrinsically gauge independent sub - leading contributions have been considered before using the theory of a scalar field in interaction with gravity@xcite . )",
    "we employ the _ imaginary time formalism_@xcite and express the one - loop thermal green functions in terms of on - shell forward scattering amplitudes ( the `` barton amplitude'')@xcite , properly generalized in order to account for the quadratic denominators which arises in the free graviton propagator when a general gauge fixing term is employed @xcite ( see also appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "this approach enable us to explore some of the general properties of the _ exact _ graviton self - energy without having to carry out explicitly the non - trivial spatial momentum integrations .",
    "it is also much more straightforward to perform the hard thermal loop expansion when we start from the forward scattering amplitudes . using this approach",
    "we were able to obtain explicit results for the @xmath1 and logarithmic contributions to the graviton self - energy .    unlike the leading high temperature terms , for which the gauge independence is confirmed by our calculation , the sub - leading contributions are gauge dependent . these contributions will be employed in the study of the dispersion relations for the transverse and traceless gravitational modes@xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we present the lagrangian and the basic definition of the graviton field from which the feynman rules are derived .",
    "we also discuss the identities which follows from the gauge invariance of the theory . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] the main results of the calculation of the one- and two - graviton functions up to the logarithmic contributions is presented .",
    "a very compact expression for the @xmath1 contribution is obtained and we verify that the logarithmic contribution is proportional to the ultraviolet pole part of the @xmath3 two - graviton function .",
    "we also derive the general transformation of the two - graviton function under a change of graviton representation . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] we verify explicitly that the gauge dependence of the sub - leading @xmath1 contributions to the two - graviton function is effectively canceled in the dispersion relations .",
    "we then present the solutions of these equations , which include corrections of order @xmath1 to the leading @xmath0 contributions , describing the physical modes for the propagation of waves in a graviton plasma .",
    "the feynman rules for the graviton propagator and self - interactions vertices are obtained from the following underlying lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , g is the newton constant and the parameter @xmath8 defines a family of gauges .",
    "( @xmath9 is the feynman gauge and @xmath10 is the landau gauge ) .",

    "the 0th order terms are quadratic in the graviton field and yield the following expression for the graviton propagator @xmath20 in the appendix  [ appb ] we give all the other relevant feynman rules employed in this work .",
    "the choice of the graviton field parametrization given by ( [ field ] ) restricts the gauge parameter dependence only to the propagator ( [ propag ] ) , since in this case the second term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is exactly quadratic in the graviton field @xmath21 .",
    "this is similar to the general _ linear gauges _ in yang - mills theories .",

    "it will be sufficient to consider the identity involving the two - point function .",
    "a simple example is provided by the following tree ward identity , arising from the invariance of the pure einstein action @xmath22 under the transformation given by equation ( [ transf ] ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the tensor generated from the transformation of the graviton field under ( [ transf ] ) and @xmath25 comes from the quadratic term in the action without the gauge fixing term ( it is the inverse of the propagator in the limit @xmath26 ) .    the tree - like identity which holds for",

    "this contrasts with the analogous situation in the case of yang - mills theories where the anti - symmetry of the group structure constants trivially makes the tadpole to vanish . as a consequence of the non - vanishing tadpole",
