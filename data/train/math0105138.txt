    "for the past decade , there has been a great deal of interest in defining new knot invariants by minimizing various functionals on the space of curves of a given knot type .",
    "for example , imagine a loop of string bearing a uniformly distributed electric charge , floating in space .",
    "the loop will repel itself , and settle into some least energy configuration .",
    "if the loop is knotted , the potential energy of this configuration will provide a measure of the complexity of the knot .    in 1991",
    "jun ohara began to formalize this picture  @xcite by proposing a family of energy functionals @xmath0 ( for @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) which are based on the physicists concept of renormalization , and which are defined by @xmath3 : = ( 1/j ) ( e_j^p[c])^{1/p}$ ] , where @xmath4 : = \\iint \\left ( \\frac{1}{|c(s ) - c(t)|^j }       - \\frac{1}{d(s , t)^j } \\right)^p \\ , ds \\ , dt,\\ ] ] @xmath5 is a unit - speed curve , @xmath6 is the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in space , and  @xmath9 is the shortest distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 along the curve .",
    "ohara showed @xcite that these integrals converge if the curve @xmath10 is smooth and embedded , @xmath11 , and that a minimizing curve exists in each isotopy class when  @xmath12 .",
    "it was then natural to try to find examples of these energy - minimizing curves in various knot types .",
    "ohara conjectured @xcite in 1992 that the energy - minimizing unknot would be the round circle for all @xmath0 energies with @xmath13 , and wondered whether this minimum would be unique .",
    "later that year , he provided some evidence to support this conjecture by proving @xcite that the limit of @xmath0 as @xmath14 and @xmath15 was the logarithm of gromov s _ distortion _ , which was known to be minimized by the round circle ( see for a simple proof ) .",
    "two years later , freedman , he , and wang investigated a family of energies almost identical to the @xmath0 energies , proving that the @xmath16 energy was mbius - invariant , and as a corollary that the overall minimizer for @xmath16 was the round circle . for the remaining @xmath17 energies",
    ", they were able to show only that the minimizing curves must be convex and planar for @xmath18 ( theorem 8.4 ) .",
    "they conjectured that these minimizers were actually circles .",
    "we generalize the energies of ohara and freedman - he - wang as follows :    given a curve @xmath10 parametrized by arclength , let @xmath6 be the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in space , and @xmath9 denote the shortest distance between @xmath19 and @xmath20 along the curve . given a function @xmath21 , the energy functional in the form @xmath22 : = \\iint f{\\left(}|c(s)-c(t)| , d(s , t ) { \\right)}\\ , ds \\ , dt,\\ ] ] is called the _ renormalization energy _ based on @xmath23 if it converges for all embedded @xmath24 curves .",
    "the main result of this paper is that a broad class of these energies are uniquely minimized by the round circle .",
    "[ main ] suppose @xmath25 is a function from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 is convex and decreasing in @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 then the renormalization energy based on @xmath23 is uniquely minimized among closed unit - speed curves of length @xmath32 by the round unit circle .",
    "it is easy to check that the hypotheses of theorem  [ main ] are slightly weaker than requiring that @xmath23 be convex and decreasing in  @xmath29 .",
    "the theorem encompasses both ohara s and freedman , he , and wang s conjectures :    [ e ] suppose @xmath33 , while @xmath34 .",

    "we must include the condition @xmath11 in our theorem , for otherwise the integral defining  @xmath37 does not converge .",
    "we do not know whether the condition @xmath34 is sharp , since the energies are well - defined for @xmath38 , but it is required for our proof .",
    "we use several ideas from a prophetic paper of l \" uk  gbor @xcite , written almost thirty years before the conjectures of ohara and freedman , he , and wang were made .",
    "l \" uk showed that among closed , unit - speed planar curves of length @xmath32 , circles are the only maximizers of any functional in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is increasing and concave .    our arguments are modeled in part on hurwitz s proof of the planar isoperimetric inequality  @xcite  @xcite . in section  [ sec : wint ] , we derive a wirtinger - type inequality ( theorem  [ kostya ] ) , which we use in section  [ sec : dist ] to generalize l \" uk s theorem ( theorem  [ fchord ] ) .",

    "since the double - covered segment has greater average @xmath240-th power chord length than the circle for @xmath45 , there must be some critical value @xmath268 of @xmath240 between @xmath266 and @xmath269 where `` the symmetry breaks '' , and circles are no longer maximizers for @xmath232 .    to find an approximate value for @xmath268 , we computed the ratio @xmath270 of the widest and narrowest projections of each of our computed maximizers for @xmath240 between @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "since all these curves are convex , a value close to unity indicates a curve close to a circle .    as figure  [ fig : widthfig ] shows , by this measure the computed minimizers are numerically very close to circles for @xmath271 . to check this conclusion",
