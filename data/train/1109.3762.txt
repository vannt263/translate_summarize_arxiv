    "radio galaxies host an extended emission from relativistic jets and lobes .",
    "jet emission is extremely enhanced by relativistic effects for blazars , whose jet direction is close to the line of sight , and observed in the multi - wavelength band from radio to tev gamma - rays .",
    "recently , fermi gamma - ray space telescope has opened a new era for studying jet emissions , by detecting more than 500 gamma - ray blazars ( abdo et al .",
    "furthermore , fermi detected 10 radio galaxies and revealed that radio galaxies are also gamma - ray emitters ( abdo et al .",
    "radio galaxies are important to study the jet structure from the mis - aligned jet direction ; jet emissions of blazars are dominated by the central region of jets due to the beaming effect while those of radio galaxies are weighted by the jet outer boundary .",
    "centaurus a ( cen a ) is the nearest radio galaxy , and its gamma - ray emission has been established by fermi ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , 2010c ) and hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "2009 ) , and is the second brightest gev gamma - ray radio galaxy , following ngc 1275 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , 2010b ) .",
    "the gev gamma - ray emission does not come from the kiloparsec - scale jet but likely from the beamed sub - arcsec jet resolved by vlbi ( abdo et al .",
    "2009c ; mueller et al .",
    "in addition , fermi found that sub - mpc giant radio lobes of the cen a are also gev gamma - ray emitters ( abdo et al .",
    "2010d ) . on the other hand , chandra resolved the x - ray emission from kiloparsec - scale jets ( kraft et al .",
    "cen a is the brightest in the hard x - ray band ( tueller et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the x - ray spectrum is very similar to that of seyfert galaxies ( wang et al .",
    "1986 , kinzer et al .",
    "1995 , rothschild et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to smoothly connect to the mev / gev emission detected with cgro comptel / egret , like blazars ( steinle et al .",
    "1998 , sreekumar et al . 1999 ) .",
    "suzaku observed the cen a in 2005 , and it was reported that seyfert - like x - ray emission was dominated ( markowitz et al .",
    "based on the integral time - averaged spectra with a long exposure , beckmann et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also indicated that the origin of the hard x - rays is preferred to be a seyfert - like emission but the nonthermal emission scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "another question on the cen a x - ray spectrum is that the reflection continuum was often not required in the spectral fitting ( rothschild et al .",
    "1999 ; markowitz et al . 2007 ;",
    "rothschild et al .",
    "2011 ; beckmann et al .",
    "2011 ) , regardless of the existence of a neutral fe - k fluorescence line . therefore , interpretation of the cen a x - ray spectrum still has several open issues .",
    "however , detailed studies of spectral variation have not been reported yet .",
    "time variability of x - ray spectra gives us important opportunities to decompose the spectral components .",
    "the cen a spectrum is strongly absorbed in the soft x - ray band like seyfert 2 galaxies , and therefore hard x - ray study of time variation is important . in order to measure the spectral variability in detail",
    ", we again observed the cen a with suzaku , which enables us to measure the short - term time variation in the hard x - ray band with the best accuracy . in this paper , we report the studies of x - ray spectral variability of the cen a with suzaku ( mitsuda et al . 2007 ) . throughout this paper , we assumed the distance to the cen a as 3.8 mpc ( rejkuba 2004 ) , and the errors are shown as a 90% confidence level .",
    "we refer to the solar photospheric values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) for the solar abundance ratio of the photoelectric absorption , reflection , and plasma model .",
    "the cross - section for absorption models is set to that of baluci@xmath2ska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "we observed the cen a three times with suzaku on july 2021 , august 56 , and august 1416 in 2009 , as summarized in table [ obs ] . in this paper , we also analyzed the suzaku data obtained in 2005 in the same way for a comparison .",
    "fugure [ batlc ] shows the periods of suzaku observations on the swift / bat light curve .",
    "the cen a entered an active phase since 2007 summer .",
    "the 2005 data correspond to the low state , while the 2009 data do to the high state .",
    "all the observations were performed with xis 5x5 or 3x3 modes ( koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) and normal hxd mode ( takahashi et al . 2007 , kokubun et al .",
    "2007 ) , except for the xis observation in 2005 , which was operated in 5x5 , 3x3 , or 2x2 modes with 1/4 window option in order to avoid the pile - up .",
    "the cen a was observed at the xis nominal position in 2005 , while it was observed at the hxd nominal position in 2009 .",
    "the xis count rate was 710 counts sec@xmath3 in 2009 , and thus the pile - up did not occur .",
    "we also confirmed no pile - up affections by checking that the results of spectral fittings did not change when we excluded the central 2-arcmin region .",
    "we utilized the data processed with the suzaku version 2.4 pipeline software , and performed the standard data reduction with criteria such as a pointing difference of @xmath4 , a elevation angle of @xmath5 from the earth rim , a geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) of @xmath66 gv , and the saa - elapsed time of @xmath7 s. further selection was applied with criteria such as an earth elevation angle of @xmath8 for the xis , cor@xmath68 gv and the saa - elapsed time ( t_saa_hxd ) of @xmath6500 s for the hxd .",
    "xis photon events were accumulated within 4 arcmin of the cen a nucleus , with the xis- 0 , 2 , and 3 data coadded .",
    "the xis rmf and arf files were created with xisrmfgen and xisarfgen ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ) , respectively , and the xis detector background was estimated with xisnxbgen ( tawa et al .",
    "for the hxd , the `` tuned '' pin and gso background was used ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2009 ) and the good time interval ( gti ) was determined by taking the logical - and of gtis among the data and background model . since the xis light - leakage estimation was not valid at the beginning of the 2005 observation , we eliminated the data in the first 12 hours .",
    "note that markowitz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) included this period in the analysis and therefore our results are somewhat different from theirs for absorption model parameters and so on .",
    "for the xis and hxd - pin , cxb was added to the background spectrum thus obtained , although it is negligible for the hxd - gso .",
    "the latest gso response file ( version 20100524 ) and the gso response correction file ( version 20100526 ) were utilized .",
    "the former is updated in terms of energy - channel linearity and gso gain history ( yamada et al . 2011 ) , and the latter compensated for any disagreement of 1020% between the crab spectral model and the data .    as a result , a net exposure time for",
    "the xis is around 33 ks , 62 ks , 51 ks , and 56 ks for the 2005 , 2009 - 1st , 2nd , and 3rd observation , respectively .",
    "the exposure time for the hxd is about 70% of the xis ones , due to additional cuts of high background periods .",
    "the hxd - pin signal rate is higher than the background rate below 50 kev , while the hxd - gso signal rate is @xmath9% of the background rate .",
    "therefore , we checked the reproducibility of the gso background as described in appendix . as a result",
    ", the reproducibility of the gso background is found to be as good as around 1% .",
    "note that the data of the 2009 1st observation was already used in abdo et al .",
    "( 2010c ) .",
    "figure [ lc ] shows the count - rate light curves of the xis ( 38 kev ) , pin ( 1540 kev ) , and gso ( 50100 kev ) , with a time bin of 10 ks .",
    "the background was subtracted for the pin and gso , while the xis background rate is @xmath10% of the signal , and thus is negligible .",
    "note that the background rate of the pin and gso is around 0.3 and 810 count s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "all the observations clearly exhibit time variability in the xis and pin light curves with an amplitude of up to 50% and a time scale of 1020 ks .",
    "this time scale is reasonable for the black hole mass of @xmath11 ( silge et al .",
    "2005 ; krajnovuie et al . 2007 ; neumayer et al .",
    "the largest variability occurred during the 2009 - 1st observation .",
    "looking at the light curves , there is a different variability pattern between the xis and pin .",
    "for example , at 050000 sec ( 15th bin ) in the 2009 - 1st observation , the rising trend of the count rate is linear for the pin and concave for the xis . at 070000 ( 2935th bin ) sec in the 2009 - 3rd observation , the variability pattern is also different between the xis and pin . for the gso light curve ,",
    "the error is somewhat large , but a similar trend of variability is clearly seen .",
    "figure [ correlation ] shows a correlation of the count rate among different energy bands . we do not treat the 2005 data , since the xis to pin effective area ratio is different between 2005 and 2009 and the data duration of the 2005 observation was short . the xis count rate in 38 kev generally correlates with the pin count rate in 1540 kev , but the slope is different among observations .",
    "furthermore , the correlation is not completely linear , especially for the 2009 - 1st and 3rd observation ; the deviation is up to 20% or so .",
    "these trends indicate that the spectral shape varied significantly , suggesting multiple spectral components or a change of the spectral shape .",
    "on the other hand , considering that the gso background reproducibility is around 0.10.2 count s@xmath3 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2009 ) , it can be said that the gso count rate in 50100 kev correlates with the pin count rate within 1020% .",
    "this situation is also the same as that in 100200 kev .",
    "therefore , the emission in 15200 kev could be mainly explained by a combination of a variable component and a constant one within errors .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the cen a is known to consist of roughly two components ; a spatially extended component in the soft band and a strongly absorbed hard nuclear component ( markowitz et al .",
    "since the spectral component in the soft band somewhat affects the modeling of the nuclear component , we first modeled the soft component by using the xis data of the 2009 2nd observation . before this analysis",
    ", we fitted the xis spectra in 210 kev , to model the hard x - ray continuum with the absorbed powerlaw model .",
    "then , we included the model of the hard component whose parameters are fixed to the values obtained above , except for the powerlaw normalization , and fitted the xis spectra in 0.73 kev with one apec thermal plasma model , together with the absorbed powerlaw model . the metal abundance is left free , and the photoelectric absorption model phabs is multiplied .",
    "the relative normalization between the xis - f and xis - b is let to be free , we ignored the 1.821.84 kev band due to the xis calibration problems .",
    "however , this modeling could not reproduce the spectra with a reduced @xmath12 values of 4.14 , since the apec model can not simultaneously explain the emission lines and the continuum around 1.52 kev where the spectral slope is around 2 . next , we added the bremss model with the absorption to model the in the cen a ( matsushita et al . 1994 )",
    ". could contribute to the x - ray emission , but the obtained x - ray luminosity of the bremss component is @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 ( 210 kev ) , which can be explained by the sum of x - ray point sources in the cen a .",
    "this is not the matter of this paper , and we do not further discuss about it in this paper .",
    "this model made the fit improve , and a reduced @xmath12 value became 1.44 , but the emission lines could not be well reproduced .",
    "markowitz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported that two - temperature plasma components were required .",
    "we thus added one more apec model whose temperature and abundance are left free .",
    "then , the spectrum is well fitted with the best - fit absorption column density and metal abundance of @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 solar , respectively , but their errors became larger .",
    "the former best - fit value is somewhat larger than that of the galactic value @xmath17 @xmath15 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , implying an additional intrinsic absorber such as .",
    "we hereafter fixed the absorption column density and metal abundance to the above values .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and markowitz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported the detection of si and s fluorescence lines . in this analysis ,",
    "the si - k line is not significant with an upper limit of @xmath18 c s@xmath3 @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we include the s - k line at 2.306 kev in the model and then the fit improved with @xmath19 , and its intensity is @xmath20 c s@xmath3 @xmath15 . as a result , the soft x - ray spectra could be fitted well with a reduced @xmath12 values of 1.25 , as shown in figure [ xisapec2 ] and the best - fit parameters are summarized in table [ xisapec ] .",
    "we also analyzed the xis spectra of other observations in the same way as above , and the results are summarized in table [ xisapec ] . since the thermal components are believed to be extended , their parameters should be constant and the best - fit values are consistent among all the observations within errors . in the following broad - band fitting for all the observations , we fixed the temperatures and column densities of the above model to the values in table [ xisapec ] .",
    "although the spectral variability during each observation is indicated in the previous subsection , we here analyze the time - averaged spectrum of each observation in order to understand the spectral shape . at first",
    ", we describe the spectral fitting of the 2009 - 2nd observation , whose time variability was relatively moderate . after determining the best - fit modeling ,",
    "we apply it to other observations .",
    "we then fit the xis - f , xis - b , pin , and gso spectra of the 2009 - 2nd observation in 0.7300 kev simultaneously to model the nuclear hard component . for each detector ,",
    "the energy range of 0.710 kev , 1570 kev , and 55300 kev for the xis , pin , and gso , respectively , are used in the fitting . a relative normalization between the xis - f and xis - b is left to be free , while that between the xis and pin , or between the pin and gso , is fixed to 1.18 ( maeda et al . 2008 ) or 1.0 , respectively .",
    "the spectral models for the soft x - ray emission were included , but the model parameters of two apec models and bremss model are fixed , and normalizations of the higher - temperature apec model and the bremss model are left free .    for the hard nuclear component ,",
    "we at first tried the basic model ; an absorbed power - law with a fe - k line ( model a ) . for the strong photoelectric absorption for the nuclear emission",
    ", we use the zvphabs model , where the fe abundance is left free and other elemental abundances are fixed to 1 solar .",
    "we tentatively included the high energy cut - off fixed at 1000 kev for the powerlaw model .",
    "the broad - band x - ray spectra in 0.7300 kev are overall fitted with this basic model .",
    "the residual of fitting with this model is shown in the 1st panel of figure [ specabc ] , where a reduced @xmath12 value is 1.21 . however , significant residual structures are seen around 1530 kev and 50300 kev . the residual around 1530 kev could be due to the reflection component , and then we include the pexrav model ( zdziarsk et al .",
    "1995 ) for the reflection ( model b ) , where the input powerlaw parameters of the pexrav model are tied to those of the direct nuclear powerlaw model and the inclination angle is assumed to be @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) ; only the free parameter is the reflection fraction @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we multiplied the reflection component by the absorption .",
    "as shown in the 2nd panel of figure [ specabc ] , the residual around 1540 kev still remains a little , but the fit improved with @xmath24 for addition of two parameters .",
    "the reflection fraction became @xmath25 , while the absorption for the reflection component is not required .",
    "alternatively , the residual structure in the 1st panel of figure [ specabc ] could be reproduced by a partial covering absorption with a column density of @xmath26 @xmath15 .",
    "then , instead of the reflection , we included the pcfabs model for representing the partial covering absorption ( model c ) .",
    "the fit gave a similar @xmath12 value ( the difference of @xmath12 is 13 ) to that for the model b ( the 3rd and 4th panels in figure [ specabc ] ) .",
    "the best - fit model gave an column density of @xmath27 @xmath15 and a covering fraction of 9@xmath283% for the partial covering absorber .",
    "we applied the above models to other observations . since the observational detector position of the cen a is different between 2005 and 2009 , a relative normalization between the xis and pin is different . unlike 2009 ,",
    "the position of the 2005 observation is not nominal and thus a nominal relative ratio of normalizations is not available .",
    "therefore , we at first set a relative normalization between the xis and pin to be free , and obtained it to be 1.06 .",
    "this is consistent with the value in markowitz et al .",
    "accordingly , we hereafter fixed the relative normalization to 1.06 for the 2005 observation .",
    "the fitting results of four observations for the model a , b , and c are summarized in table [ fita][fitc ] .",
    "the model b and c gave a better fit than the model a for all the observations , and they gave a similar @xmath12 value for 2009 three observations , while the model c gave a significant improvement of the fitting for the 2005 observation .",
    "markowitz et al . ( 2007 ) reported a similar trend for the 2005 observation .",
    "figure [ speccmpall ] compares the @xmath29 spectra of all observations , and figure [ specmcsed ] shows the best - fit @xmath29 spectra of the 2009 2nd observation .",
    "it can be seen that the soft x - ray emission in 0.72 kev is at almost the same flux level because the emission comes from the extended region , while the hard x - ray emission brightened in 2009 ; 0.2 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 and 0.2 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 at 20 kev and 100 kev , respectively , in 2005 , 0.30.4 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 and 0.40.5 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 at 20 kev and 100 kev , respectively , in 2009 . in the following ,",
    "let us look at the fitting results for the model c. the column density of uniform absorber is almost constant at @xmath30 @xmath15 for all the observations .",
    "the covering fraction of the partial covering absorber is around 30% in 2005 , while it is around 810% in 2009 .",
    "the column density of the partial covering absorber is not constant , but two observations in 2009 gave a compton - thick value of @xmath31 @xmath15 .",
    "the large difference appears for the powerlaw photon index ; 1.94 in 2005 and 1.681.71 in 2009 . in other words ,",
    "the cen a spectrum became significantly harder in 2009 as can be seen in figure [ specmcsed ] .",
    "the intensity of the neutral fe - k fluorescence line is @xmath32 c s@xmath3 @xmath15 in 2005 and @xmath33 c s@xmath3 @xmath15 in 2009 .",
    "this is the first evidence of variability of the fe - k line intensity for the cen a , and the fe - k line intensity is considered to be high in 2009 as a result of brightening of the cen a continuum emission since 2007 .",
    "although the time - averaged spectra can be fitted with the model b or c , both of the models have a problem . for the model",
    "b , the reflection component is generally considered to be constant and thus only the powerlaw component can not explain the complex time variability as described in  3.1 .",
    "the fluorescence fe - k line is significantly detected with an equivalent width ( ew ) of 78 , 56 , 69 , 56 ev for the 2005 , 2009 1st , 2009 2nd , 2009 3rd observation , respectively , indicating that there is an underlying reflection continuum and thus the model c does not match this evidence .",
    "the reflection fraction in the model b is around 0.190.34 in 2009 and 0.41 in 2005 .",
    "the ew of the fe - k line against the reflection component is 1.02.0 kev , and this is reasonable for the compton - thick reflector with one solar abundance .",
    "therefore , both of the reflection component and the partial covering absorption are likely to be required .",
    "the above results are obtained by assuming that the exponential cut - off energy of the powerlaw model is 1000 kev .",

    "plot of the xis / pin / gso spectra of the 2009 2nd observation with the model e.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the cen a has been found to be a gamma - ray emitter up to the tev band , while black hole binaries and ngc 4151 are not .",
    "therefore , the nonthermal jet component , which connects to the high energy gamma - ray band , is expected to exist in the x - ray band .",
    "we included one more powerlaw model in addition to the model d , and multiplied it by the absorption with a column density of @xmath39 @xmath15 ; in this case , we can not constrain the parameters of both powerlaw components well . in addition , the intensity of the hard powerlaw component becomes coupled with that of the reflection component .",
    "then , we replaced the pexrav model by the pexmon model ( nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) for the reflection component .",
    "the pexmon model considered the fe - k and ni - k fluorescence lines and thus we can constrain the reflection component by the prominent fe - k line . in this case , the gaussian model for the fe - k line is not included for fitting ( model e ) .",
    "figure [ contpo2 ] shows a confidence contour between the soft and hard powerlaw photon index , where we plot the 95% confidence contours of three 2009 observations .",
    "the photon index of the soft and hard component is constrained to be around 1.9 and 1.6 , respectively , for all 2009 observations .",
    "the photon index of the hard component depends on the assumed absorption ; when the absorption is weaker , the photon index becomes smaller and the fraction of the hard component in the softer x - ray band becomes smaller .",
    "thus the photon index of 1.6 is considered to give an upper limit of the hard component .",
    "then , we fixed the photon indices of the two powerlaw components to 1.6 and 1.9 .",
    "table [ fite ] summarized the fitting results , and figure [ specmde ] shows the best - fit model and spectra .",
    "the @xmath12 value is smaller than those of the model d for the 2009 1st observation , but almost the same as those of the model d for others .",
    "the fraction of the reflection component is around 0.40.5 and the fe abundance is around 0.70.9 solar , these are typical values for seyfert galaxies , and therefore reasonable values ; it can be said that we correctly model the reflection component .",
    "the flux of the additional powerlaw component was @xmath4310% and 30% of the original powerlaw at 100 kev in 2005 and 2009 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the flux increase of the additional hard powerlaw component , possibly associated with the jet , can explain the harder spectra in 2009 , but the seyfert - like component is still dominant in the suzaku x - ray band even if the jet component exists .      in order to check the view of the model e , we performed time - resolved spectral fittings for the 2009 observations .",
    "we divided the xis , pin , and gso data of each observation into 1114 periods as a step of 10 ks .",
    "each period corresponds to each bin of the light curve in figure [ lc ] . since the signal - to - noise ratio is low , we fixed the following parameters to the best - fit values obtained for the time - averaged spectra of each observation in table [ fite ] ; reflection fraction , normalization of reflected powerlaw emission , fe abundance of absorber and reflector , normalization of the s - k line , parameters of the soft thermal components .",
    "then , free parameters are a column density of the uniform absorber , a column density and covering fraction of the thicker absorber , and normalizations of two powerlaw component . in addition , we ignored the data below 3 kev , where the thermal component is dominant .",
    "figure [ specparhist ] shows a time history of spectral parameters .",
    "the column density of the uniform absorber is less variable ; with at most 10% variability .",
    "the most variable parameters are the normalization of the lower energy powerlaw component , the column density and covering fraction of the thicker absorber .",
    "this could create a complex correlation behavior in subsection 3.1 .",
    "the normalization of the higher energy powerlaw component is almost constant , but a small variability is seen for the 3rd observation .",
    "it shows an anticorrelation with the normalization of the lower energy powerlaw component , and therefore this could be artificial .",
    "no clear correlation between the lower and higher energy powerlaw components suggests a different origin between two components .    .",
    "from top to bottom , an uniform absorption column density in unit of @xmath44 @xmath15 , a partial covering absorption column density in unit of @xmath44 @xmath15 , a partial covering fraction of absorption , and normalizations of the soft and hard powerlaw component in unit of ph @xmath15 s@xmath45 kev@xmath3 at 1 kev , are shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in summary , we measured the broad - band x - ray spectral variability of the cen a more accurately than ever with suzaku , and found that the variable component is a powerlaw with a partially covering compton - thick absorption of @xmath26 @xmath15 .",
    "we also found a variability of the fe - k line intensity from 2005 to 2009 by a factor of 1.3 or so . the reflection component associated with the fe - k line",
    "is also suggested in the spectral modeling , and furthermore an additional hard powerlaw component with a photon index of @xmath1 is inferred .",
    "x - ray time variability of the cen a has been reported with the cgro / batse , cgro / osse , rxte , xmm - newton , integral , and swift / bat , for various time scales from sub - days to years ( kinzer et al .",
    "1995 , wheaton et al .",
    "1996 , rothschild et al . 1999 ,",
    "rothschild et al .",
    "2006 , evans et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "rxte and integral observations reported that the time variability is caused by the change of absorption column density , the powerlaw photon index , and the powerlaw normalization , based on the spectral fitting by a powerlaw model with an uniform absorption ( rothschild et al .",
    "the absorption column density is in the range of @xmath46 @xmath15 , the powerlaw photon index is in the range of 1.651.85 , and the flux is @xmath47 erg @xmath15 in 20100 kev . for the suzaku observations ( table [ fita ] ) ,",
    "the column density is @xmath48 @xmath15 , the powerlaw photon index is in the range of 1.651.82 , and the powerlaw flux in 20100 kev is @xmath49 erg @xmath15 s@xmath3 and @xmath50 erg @xmath15 s@xmath3 in 2005 and 2009 , respectively , based on the same model .",
    "therefore , the spectral parameters match the past observations . however , the accurate spectroscopy with suzaku revealed that a powerlaw model with an uniform absorption was not valid , and the x - ray variation is partly caused by the change of the partial covering compton - thick absorber , together with the change of the powerlaw continuum level with a time scale of sub - days .",
    "the absorption column density of the uniform one is almost constant around @xmath51 @xmath15 .",
    "the variability of the fe - k line has never been reported in the past observations ; it is steady around @xmath52 ph @xmath15 s@xmath3 .",
    "suzaku for the first time confirmed that the fe - k line intensity significantly increased by a factor of several tens percents from 2005 to 2009 , following the brightening of the continuum flux since 2007 .",
    "this suggests that the fe - k line emitter lies at a distance of @xmath10 pc from the nucleus .",
    "the fe - k line intensity observed with suzaku is @xmath53 ph @xmath15 s@xmath3 , and therefore it is relatively weaker than ever .",
    "rxte results reported that the fe - k line intensity is around @xmath52 ph @xmath15 s@xmath3 in 2004 , just before the suzaku 2005 observation .",
    "however , we must take care that the rxte energy resolution of @xmath421000 ev can not accurately resolve a fe - k line with an ew of @xmath42100 ev .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton results were close to the suzaku ones .",
    "the behavior in the soft gamma - ray band was well studied with the osse ( kinzer et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the spectral cut - off shape varied in such a way that the cut - off was clearer in the bright phase ( 0.6 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 at 100 kev ) than in the faint phase ( 0.2 kev @xmath15 s@xmath3 at 100 kev ) .",
    "suzaku 2005 data correspond to the faint phase , and the 2009 data do to the bright phase .",
    "however , the spectral cut - off is not clearly detected with suzaku both in 2005 and 2009 .",
    "this would be related with the additional powerlaw component , and we discuss this issue in the following subsection .      the location of the stable uniform absorber can be constrained by the fe - k edge which is almost attributed to the uniform absorber for the time - averaged spectra .",
    "the edge energy is @xmath54 kev in 2009 , leading to the ionization parameter of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the luminosity of the central engine , @xmath57 the matter density , and @xmath23 the distance to the matter ( kallman et al .",
    "2004 ) . considering the column density @xmath58 , the uniform absorber lies at @xmath59 pc away from the nucleus , where we take @xmath60 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath61 @xmath15",
    "therefore , the uniform absorber is likely to be associated with the famous dust lane lying on the elliptical galaxy .    on the other hand ,",
    "the location of the thicker partial covering absorber can be constrained by the fe - k edge in the difference spectra between high and low flux states ; the edge energy is @xmath62 kev , corresponding to @xmath63 . in the same way as above , using @xmath64 @xmath15 , the location is constrained to be @xmath65 pc .",
    "the variation of absorber parameters with a time scale of @xmath66 day indicates the blob - like structure . taking the black hole mass of @xmath67 @xmath68 ,",
    "the kepler velocity is @xmath69 cm s@xmath3 at a radius of 0.16 pc .",
    "then , the size of blobs perpendicular to the line of sight becomes @xmath70 cm .",
    "since the size toward the line of sight is likely to be the same order as above , the density becomes @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "the fe - k line ew is typical for seyfert galaxies with a similar absorption column density ( fukazawa et al .",
    "this indicates that there is a compton - thick material covering a large solid angle of @xmath73 or so .",
    "considering the variation time scale of @xmath74 year , the material is a molecular torus which is believed to exist commonly in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic emission irradiating the material is unlikely to be the beamed jet emission , since the jet emission concentrates within a small solid angle along the jet direction by the relativistic effect .",
    "therefore , the seyfert - like emission originating from the inner disk region is thought to dominate in the x - ray band .",
    "our analysis of the suzaku data suggests the additional hard powerlaw component with a photon index of @xmath1 , whose flux is around 30% of the total flux at 100 kev .",
    "this hard component might be brighter in 2009 active phase than in 2005 faint phase . the crossover energy against another powerlaw emission , which is likely to be a seyfert - like nuclear emission dominated below 100 kev , is around 400 kev .",
    "this hard component seems to smoothly connect to the cgro / comptel mev gamma - ray emission as shown in figure [ cenased ] .",
    "cgro / egret and fermi / lat detected the gev gamma - ray emission from the cen a , whose spectrum well connects to the mev emission . as reported by abdo et al .",
    "( 2010c ) , the multi - wavelength spectrum of the cen a can be modeled by the synchrotron self - compton model .",
    "the predicted jet flux in the x - ray band strongly depends on the model parameters , such as magnetic field , emission size , low energy electron spectrum , and so on ( abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) . both of decelerating jet ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ) and structure jet ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2000 ) can explain the x - ray emission inferred in this paper , and the possible hard component obtained by the suzaku data could be a lower energy part of the compton component .    .",
    "jet emission has been detected in the x - ray band for a radio galaxy 3c120 with suzaku ( kataoka et al .",
    "2007 ) ; where the variable soft x - ray component was detected with a shorter time scale than the seyfert - like nuclear emission . for the cen",
    "a , the possible jet x - ray component has a longer time scale of variability than the seyfert - like emission . considering that gev gamma - ray emission shows no significant variability over one year",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) , the jet emission is less beamed and thus the relativistic effect on the variability is smaller .",
    "the jet emission in the x - ray band is often not well understood for other radio galaxies .",
    "astro - h / sgd will give us the first opportunity to detect the hard excess component clearly from the cen a and other radio galaxies .",
    "also , the astro - h can search for the jet emission from the x - ray spectral variability with the sensitive wide - band x - ray spectroscopy , as well as the cen a and 3c120 .",
    "plot of the cen a from the x - ray to gev gamma - ray band .",
    "data points are obtained with the suzaku ( 2009 ) , cgro / comptel ( 19911994 ) , and fermi / lat ( 20082009 ) .",

    "j. kataoka and the anonymous referee for careful reading and helpful comments .",
    "the authors also wish to thank all members of the suzaku science working group , for their contributions to the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in - orbit calibration .",
    "this work is partly supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan ( 20340044 ) .",
    "since the gso signal rate from the cen a is less than 10% of the gso background , the systematic uncertainty of the gso background reproducibility is not ignored .",
    "then , we checked the reproducibility by using the earth occultation data during the 2009 cen a observation . since the cxb is negligible , we expect no extra signal than the background .",
    "figure [ earthsp ] shows the comparison of gso spectra between the earth occultation data and background model , indicating that the background model well reproduce the earth occultation spectra with an accuracy of 2% or so .",
    "figure [ earthlc ] shows the comparison of gso light curve between the earth occultation data and background model , indicating that the background model well reproduce the history of the earth occultation rate with an accuracy of 2% or so .",
    "therefore , the background reproducibility is as good as 1% .    for the 2005 observation , no earth occultation occurred during the observation .",
    "however , the background rate is lower by a factor of @xmath75 than the 2009 observation .",
