    "sgr  a * , the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy , has been observed for several decades .",
    "monitoring stars orbiting around sgr  a * has led to measurements of its mass and distance ( ghez et al . 2008 ; gillessen et al . 2009 ) . however , these measurements of mass and distance are strongly correlated . for purely astrometric measurements , mass and distance",
    "are related as @xmath3 , while for measurements of radial velocities mass and distance are related as @xmath4 . for combined data sets , the correlation between mass and distance behaves roughly as @xmath2 ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "this correlation between mass and distance constitutes a major source of uncertainty in our understanding of the properties of sgr  a*. likewise , dynamical measurements of the masses of a number of nearby supermassive black holes have been obtained with often much greater uncertainties ( see , e.g. , gltekin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "another technique , vlbi , aims to image sgr  a * directly .",
    "recent vlbi observations with an array consisting of the submillimeter telescope observatory ( smto ) in arizona , the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , and several of the dishes of the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) in california resolved sgr  a * on scales comparable to its event horizon and identified sub - horizon size structures ( doeleman et al .",
    "2008 ; fish et al .",
    "images of accretion flows around black holes have the shadow of the compact object imprinted on them , which depends uniquely on its mass , spin , and inclination ( e.g. , falcke et al . 2000 ) as well as on possible deviations from the kerr metric ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) . based on such images and assuming the mass and distance obtained from the monitoring of stellar orbits , these vlbi observations inferred constraints on the inclination and spin of sgr  a * ( broderick et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) and placed limits on potential non - kerr signatures ( broderick et al . 2012 ) .",
    "in addition to the shadow , images of optically thin accretion flows around black holes carry a characteristic signature in the form of a bright ring ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) , which we refer to as the photon ring .",
    "light rays that approach the event horizon closely orbit around the black hole many times before they are detected by a distant observer , resulting in a bright ring due to their long optical path length through the accretion flow .",
    "the flux of such photons can account for a significant fraction of the total disk flux and produce higher order images ( cunningham 1976 ; laor , netzer , & piran 1990 ; viergutz 1993 ; bao , hadrava , & stgaard 1994 ; @xmath5 , fanton , & calvani 1998 ; agol & krolik 2000 ; beckwith & done 2005 ) .",
    "these photon rings are clearly visible in all time - dependent general - relativistic simulations of accretion flows that have been reported to date ( mo@xmath6cibrodzka et al . 2009 ; dexter , agol , & fragile 2009 ; shcherbakov & penna 2010 ) .",
    "johannsen & psaltis ( 2010 ) showed that a measurement of the ring diameter measures the ratio @xmath7 for the black hole , independent of its spin or deviation from the kerr metric .",
    "therefore , combining such a measurement with the observations of stars around sgr  a * can reduce the correlation between mass and distance .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the ability of this approach to refine the mass and distance measurements of sgr  a*. we estimate the precision with which a thermal noise - limited vlbi array can infer the diameter of the ring of sgr  a * and use a bayesian technique to simulate measurements of the mass and diameter of sgr  a * in conjunction with parameters inferred from the existing data of the orbits of stars at comparable wavelengths .",
    "we show that , in this best - case scenario , the correlation between mass and distance is reduced significantly .",
    "in addition , we argue that the accretion flows of other nearby supermassive black holes are optically thin , allowing for vlbi observations of their respective photon rings .",
    "we assess the prospects of using this technique to infer the masses of these sources .",
    "the properties of photon rings are practically independent of the specific flow geometry and remain constant even if the accretion flow itself is highly variable ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) . the relative brightness as well as the constancy of these rings make them ideal targets for vlbi - imaging observations .    for a kerr black hole with mass @xmath0 , the shape of a given photon ring has a diameter of @xmath8 which remains practically constant for all values of the spin and disk inclination ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) . in this expression , @xmath9 is the gravitational radius , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the angular diameter @xmath12 of the diameter of the photon ring of a black hole is given by the ratio of its diameter and distance , @xmath13 assuming the current mass and distance measurements of sgr  a * , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( gillessen et al . 2009 ) , the photon ring has an angular diameter of @xmath16    radio interferometers are limited by their intrinsic resolution as well as by interstellar scattering . in order to identify the range of wavelengths within which vlbi measurements of the photon ring of sgr  a * are resolution - limited , we compare the blurring effects of interstellar scattering with the resolution of an interferometer . in figure  [ f : openingangle ] we plot the minimum size of resolvable structures on the image of sgr  a * using the interstellar scattering law of bower et al .",
    "we also estimate ( dashed line ) the resolution of a radio interferometer at a given wavelength @xmath17 by the expression @xmath18 with @xmath19 and a diameter @xmath20 , which is comparable to the baseline length between the jcmt on hawaii and the south pole telescope .",
    "this yields @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the resolution in @xmath23arcsec and @xmath24 is the observed wavelength in mm .",
    "dotted lines mark the angular diameters corresponding to length scales of @xmath25 and @xmath26 at the assumed distance of sgr  a*. as can be seen from this figure , at sub - mm wavelengths interstellar scattering becomes negligible and measurements are limited by the resolution .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the diameter of the photon ring of sgr  a * will require vlbi observations at wavelengths @xmath27 .    in the following , we estimate the observed flux of the photon ring of sgr a * assuming a schwarzschild black hole and employing a model of a geometrically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; narayan , yi , & mahadevan 1995 ) .",
    "adafs model the accreting gas around a supermassive black hole as a quasi - spherically symmetric plasma consisting of thermal electrons and ions at different temperatures ( narayan & yi 1995a ,  b ) as well as of non - thermal electrons ( mahadevan 1999 ; zel , psaltis , & narayan 2000 ; yuan , quataert , & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "such an accretion flow is allowed to cool through comptonization and the emission of bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation , with the latter generating the predominant contribution to the observed spectrum of sgr a * at radio and wavelengths ( narayan et al .",
    "1995 ) .    for our estimate ,",
    "we follow broderick et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and assume an adaf model with a density of thermal electrons @xmath28 electron temperature @xmath29 and magnetic field @xmath30 where @xmath31 . for the coefficients we use ( broderick et al .",
    "2011 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 these coefficients lead to predictions of the spectrum , polarization , and image size for sgr  a * that are in agreement with all current observations .",
    "we assume that all the emission at mm - wavelengths is due to thermal synchrotron radiation ( see narayan et al .",
    "while there may be small contributions of synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons ( e.g. , mahadevan 1998 ; zel et al .",
    "2000 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) or of other types of radiation at these wavelengths ( such as jets ; e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "1993 ) , this assumption affects our analysis only marginally . in practice",
    ", the measured total flux incorporates all such contributions .",
    "following dolence et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we write the synchrotron emissivity as @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of the second order . here , @xmath39 is the angle between the wave vector of the emitted photon and the magnetic field . for our estimate",
    ", we use the average @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that optical paths follow at least one loop along the circular photon orbit of a schwarzschild black hole located at radius @xmath41 .",
    "the emitted intensity of radiation is then given by the expression @xmath42 the observed intensity is related to the emitted intensity by the third power of the redshift factor , which we take to be the gravitational redshift of a photon observed at infinity emitted from @xmath41 ( i.e. , we neglect for this simple estimate the high velocity of the flow , which will serve to increase the intensity at infinity ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath43 where @xmath44    the photon ring has an approximate width of @xmath45 in the image plane ( johannsen & psaltis 2010 ) .",
    "then , the subtended solid angle is given by the expression @xmath46    this yields our estimate for the observed flux density of the photon ring : @xmath47    in figure  [ ringflux ] , we plot the modeled ring flux density as a function of wavelength .",
    "we also plot a blackbody function evaluated at the same emission radius and temperature given by expression ( [ temperature ] ) as an upper flux density limit .",
    "the above estimate exceeds the blackbody flux density at wavelengths @xmath48 , and , thus , at these longer wavelengths , the emission becomes self - absorbed .",
    "therefore , we use the minimum of these two flux densities as an estimate of the ring flux density . at wavelengths",
    "@xmath49 , the modeled flux density of the photon ring of sgr  a * is @xmath50 , about 1/15 of the total source flux density . since @xmath49 is also in the regime where vlbi observations are resolution - limited ( see figure  [ f : openingangle ] ) , this range of wavelengths is optimal for such measurements .",
    "the ring diameter is determined solely by the mass via equation ( [ ringdiameter ] ) , and we can relate the black - hole mass and the angular diameter of the ring according to the expression @xmath51 therefore , for vlbi imaging , the mass is proportional to the distance , and we can reduce the correlation between mass and distance in combination with dynamical measurements .",
    "we now explore the prospect of combining dynamical measurements of sgr  a * with vlbi imaging observations of the photon ring .",
    "we analyze the best - case scenario of a thermal noise - limited vlbi array in order to assess whether such a measurement is worthwhile .",
    "systematic limitations will degrade the vlbi measurement somewhat , as discussed below .",
    "we employ a bayesian analysis to estimate the probability distribution over the mass and distance of sgr  a * from a measurement of the angular diameter of the photon ring in combination with the constraints obtained from stellar dynamics .",
    "we take the latter as our prior , @xmath52 , by converting into a likelihood the @xmath53 distribution with @xmath54 degrees of freedom obtained from the existing data set of the ephemerides of several s - stars ( gillessen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we assume a gaussian posterior likelihood of obtaining a particular measurement of the angular diameter as @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is given by equation ( [ openingangle ] ) and @xmath56 .",
    "we then use bayes theorem to write the likelihood of a particular mass and distance of the black hole given the data as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the appropriate constant that normalizes the likelihood .    the measurement uncertainty @xmath59 is the key parameter of the likelihood @xmath60 .",
    "in the following , we estimate the scaling of the measurement uncertainty with resolution .",
    "the spatial frequencies of interest are those beyond the first null of the bessel function describing the fourier transform of the ring structure in visibility space . for a given resolution and ring",
    "size , there are @xmath61 accessible half periods of the oscillation , where @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 the typical amplitude of a bessel function oscillation of the first few maxima is of order 0.3 of the peak .",
    "therefore , the signal we seek to measure has an amplitude of @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the observed flux density of sgr  a * near 1  mm ( see , e.g. , broderick et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we estimate the expected signal to noise ratio on this measurement by scaling it from the current vlbi measurements .",
    "fish et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measure the size of sgr  a * with a signal to noise ratio of @xmath65 .",
    "near - future vlbi arrays will incorporate 5 or 6 stations .",
    "one of them , alma , will have the sensitivity of 50 of the current stations resulting in an overall increase in array sensitivity of a factor of up to roughly 9.3 .",
    "in addition , the scheduled increase of recording bandwidth will increase the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath66 . to account for the variation in system temperature for typical observing conditions and receiver performance",
    "we introduce a degradation in snr proportional to the observing wavelength squared , normalized to the 1.3  mm performance in fish et al .",
    "the total signal to noise ratio of this measurement will then be @xmath67 with the width of the distribution given by the expression @xmath68    in figure  [ contours ] , we plot confidence contours of the joint probability distribution for the combination of future thermal noise - limited vlbi and current astrometric observations at three different wavelengths .",
    "the solid line marks the 95% confidence contour determined by the stellar ephemerides ( gillessen et al .",
    "a vlbi measurement at a wavelength of @xmath69 significantly improves the result from stellar orbits alone . at smaller wavelengths , the constraints on the mass and distance of sgr  a *",
    "are similar . in the rightmost panel of figure  3",
    ", we have extrapolated the distribution width @xmath59 given by expression ( [ distwidth ] ) to a nominal wavelength of @xmath70 .",
    "measurements at such short wavelengths will be limited by weather conditions and may have to rely on a smaller array with fewer telescopes .",
    "real observations will face more stringent limitations than those imposed by the interferometer thermal noise due to the complications of astrophysics and measurement systematics .",
    "the chief astrophysical limitation is the separation of the ring emission from the source structure in the uv - plane . in our estimate , we have used the location of the nulls as a benchmark for the uncertainties we expect from the vlbi measurement . in practice , however , the full visibility function has to be analyzed with a pattern matching technique that identifies the structure of the ring .",
    "such a technique has to extract the ring from a uv - plane that is only partially sampled by a given set of baselines .",
    "the physics of the accretion flow will also complicate things , as the structure of sgr a * may vary over the course of an observation .",
    "however , because the ring structure is persistent and only weakly altered by rapid changes in the accretion flow we expect that temporal averaging of the visibilities across multiple observing epochs will diminish the importance of such changes .",
    "the vlbi measurement itself must surmount systematic limitations to make the moderate dynamic range measurements proposed here .",
    "chief among these is the difficulty of calibrating the noise level at individual stations , which imposed a 5% uncertainty in fish et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with the three - station array . in observations with the larger array considered here",
    ", there will be many more internal cross - checks available to improve the relative calibration of stations ( the absolute calibration is not important ) .",
    "in particular , the use of three phased interferometers ( mauna kea , carma , alma ) that simultaneously record conventional interferometric data will permit scan - by - scan cross calibration of the amplitude scale of the array .    furthermore , the larger arrays will be able to make use of closure phases and closure amplitudes that are immune to calibration errors as part of the ring detection , although we have ignored such procedures here because of the difficulty of simply parameterizing the improvement they can permit .",
    "other effects , such as the coherence of the reference systems between stations ( reported as @xmath71% in fish et al .",
    "2011 ) can be more carefully measured and corrected to prevent them from imposing fundamental limitations to the ring detection .",
    "besides sgr  a * , there exist other nearby supermassive black holes , for which a combination of dynamical measurements and vlbi observations could be feasible . since these supermassive black holes are located in host galaxies other than the milky way , observations are much less affected by interstellar scattering . as an example",
    ", broderick & loeb ( 2009 ) and takahashi & mineshige ( 2011 ) analyzed the prospects of imaging the shadow of m87 with vlbi observations at several different wavelengths .    in figure",
    "[ smbhs ] , we plot the angular diameter of the photon rings against the distances of a collection of nearby supermassive black holes .",
    "sgr  a * is closest to us and has the largest angular diameter , closely followed by m87 and m31 due to their large black hole masses .",
    "the top dashed line indicates the resolution of a telescope array with a baseline equal to the diameter of the earth ( from equation ( [ resolution ] ) ) at a wavelength of 1  mm . for comparison",
    ", we also show the resolution of a future space telescope located at 30% the distance to the moon ( comparable to the orbit of _ chandra _ ) at a wavelength of 0.5  mm corresponding to an angular diameter of about @xmath72 as well as of the proposed _ millimetron _ mission ( wild et al . 2009 ) at a distance of @xmath73 and a wavelength of @xmath74 .",

    "<S> dynamical mass measurements to date have allowed determinations of the mass @xmath0 and the distance @xmath1 of a number of nearby supermassive black holes . in the case of sgr  </S>",
    "<S> a * , these measurements are limited by a strong correlation between the mass and distance scaling roughly as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> future very - long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observations will image a bright and narrow ring surrounding the shadow of a supermassive black hole , if its accretion flow is optically thin . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the prospects of reducing the correlation between mass and distance with the combination of dynamical measurements and vlbi imaging of the ring of sgr  a*. we estimate the signal to noise ratio of near - future vlbi arrays that consist of five to six stations , and we simulate measurements of the mass and distance of sgr  a * using the expected size of the ring image and existing stellar ephemerides . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , in this best - case scenario , vlbi observations at 1  mm can improve the error on the mass by a factor of about two compared to the results from the monitoring of stellar orbits alone . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the additional sources of uncertainty that such imaging observations have to take into account . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we calculate the angular diameters of the bright rings of other nearby supermassive black holes and identify the optimal targets besides sgr  a * that could be imaged by a ground - based vlbi array or future space - vlbi missions allowing for refined mass measurements . </S>"
