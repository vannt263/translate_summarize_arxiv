    "inspiralling compact binary systems are among the most promising sources for the emission of gravitational waves detectable with present day s gravitational wave interferometers .",

    "this corresponds roughly to the last 10 minutes of the inspiral before final plounge . in that regime newtonian mechanics",
    "is not valid and post - newtonian approximation must be applied .",
    "an earlier stage of the inspiral process will be covered by the yet to be built lisa interferometer .",
    "it is expected that lisa will be sensible to gravitational waves with frequencies from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 hz . however , in order to actually detect gravitational waves highly accurate templates are essentially .",
    "post - newtonian corrections must be included into the eom .",
    "moreover , computing the gravitational waveforms beyond the leading order approximation higher mass and current multipole moments must be taken into account .",
    "+ in the past the study of close compact binaries was often based on the assumption that the stars can be treated as pointlike , non - spinning objects . upon this assumption",
    "it is possible to derive an analytic , so called quasi - keplerian solution for the conservative part of the eom up to the third post - newtonian approximation @xcite .",

    "+ in the presence of at least one spinning component a post - newtonian spin - orbit coupling which first appears at 1.5 post - newtonian order leads to complifications , which hamper the investigation of spinning compact binary systems enormeously . in general , neither orbital angular momentum nor the stellar spin are conserved . up to now an analytic solution to the conservative part of the eom including",
    "spin - orbit coupling has been found in a few special cases only ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ thus far not much progress has been made in the investigation of close binary systems of finite size objects . within the framework of post - newtonian analysis",
    "it is often argued that finite size effects are neglegible during most of the inspiral process and will become important not until the last few orbits before the final plunge @xcite .",
    "growing interest in the role of finite size effects comes mainly from the side of numerical relativity .",
    "in fact , though finite size effects due to stellar rotation and oscillation in compact binary systems are very small they can well be in the order of the first post - newtonian corrections to the orbital dynamics .",
    "these secular effects , being of newtonian origin , accumulate over a large number of orbits and thus , seen at longer terms , lead to significant phase shifts in the gravitational waves .",
    "the influence of stellar oscillations on the dynamical evolution and leading order gravitational wave emission has been investigated by kokkotas and schfer @xcite and lai and ho @xcite for nonrotating , polytropic neutron stars and by lai _",
    "et al _ @xcite and hansen @xcite for riemann - s binaries .",
    "in all these approaches the analysis was based on newtonian theory , the 2.5pn radiation reaction terms being the only post - newtonian terms included .",
    "+ this paper is devoted to the investigation of the influence of finite size effects on the dynamics and gravitational wave emission beyond the leading order approximation .",
    "basically , perturbations of the point particle dynamics arise due to stellar oscillations ( mainly tidally driven ) and rotational deformation . here",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to systems were the apsidal motion due to rotational deformation is much larger than the one caused by stellar oscillations . + to begin with , let us note that there is , strictly speaking , no spinning point particle .",
    "a spinning object automatically gains a finite size ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it hat been long known that the coupling of the nonvanishing stellar quadrupole moment to the orbital motion , which is a purely newtonian effect , leads to an apsidal motion .",
    "for a couple of close main sequence star binaries this apsidal motion has been observed to great accuracy ( see e.g. claret and willems @xcite ) . in these systems apsidal motion due to finite size effects is considerably larger than the relativistic periastron advance .",
    "another group of binary systems , where finite size effects play an important role , are binary pulsars such as psr b 1259 - 63 , which has been found by johnston _",
    "et al . _ in 1992 @xcite .",
    "while the compact component of psr 1259 - 63 is a 47 ms pulsar , it s companion is a be star , whose spin - induced quadrupole deformation leads to an apsidal motion .",
    "+ however , it is close compact binary systems which are most relevant for gravitational wave detectors .",
    "this includes not only black hole - black hole , black hole - neutron star or neutron star - neutron star binaries but , if lisa is ready to work , also close white dwarf binaries .",
    "of course the rotational deformation of compact stars is much smaller than it would be possible in non - compact stars .",
    "however , at least for neutron star ( ns ) and white dwarf ( wd ) binaries one should not a priori neglect finite size effects due to quadrupole deformation . in particular",
    "it is well possible that the perturbations introduced by the coupling of the stellar quadrupole moment to the orbital motion is of the same order of magnitude as the first post - newtonian corrections .",
    "this is assumed throughout the paper .",
    "the analysis applies to compact binary systems , whose spinning component is a wd or a fast rotating ns . in order to simplify calculations",
    "it is assumed that the spin is perpendicular to the orbital plane . in section [ sec:2 ] the orbital evolution of a spinning compact binary",
    "is studied up to first post newtonian order in the point particle dynamics .",
    "the eom as well as a parametric , quasi - keplerian solution are derived . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "the next to leading order gravitational waveforms are calculated explicitly . the long time evolution and the influence of the quadrupole coupling to the inspiral process",
    "is discussed in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in 1985 damour and deruelle @xcite succeeded in deriving an analytic solution to the 1pn eom of a point - particle binary , which exhibits a remarkable similarity to the well known kepler parametrization in newtonian theory and is hence called quasi - keplerian solution . using the same strategy",
    "wex considered a binary consisting of a pulsar and a spinning main sequence component at newtonian order @xcite . treating the newtonian coupling between the rotationally deformed star and the orbital dynamics as a small perturbation he derived a quasi - keplerian solution up to first order in the deformation parameter @xmath3 , which will be introduced in the following . in this letter",
    "we shall extend his investigations , taking into account the orbital dynamics up to first post - newtonian approximation . in order to derive an analytic solution",
    "we shall further assume that the modifications induced by finite size effects are of the same order as the 1pn orbital corrections .",
    "that is , we restrict our analysis to compact binary systems consisting of a fast spinning neutron star or white dwarf and a non - spinning compact object .",
    "of course , all results can be applied to a mean sequence star - compact star binary in the newtonian limit .",
    "+ the rotational deformation of a spinning star of mass @xmath4 can be described by some parameter @xmath3 , which is defined as @xcite @xmath5       = \\delta i,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the stellar mass and @xmath7 is the difference of the moments of inertia parallel and perpendicular to the spin axis @xmath8 , respectively . in particular , for rotating fluids , @xmath3 is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the polar radius and @xmath11 the angular velocity of the rotating star .",
    "the constant of apsidal motion @xmath12 strongly depends on the density distribution .",
    "it vanishes if all mass is concentrated in the center and takes it s maximal value @xmath13 for a homogeneous sphere .",
    "neutron stars and low mass white dwarfs can be approximately modelled by an polytropic eos with index n=@xmath14 and @xmath15 for neutron stars and white dwarfs , respectively .",
    "in fact , for polytropes the value of @xmath12 is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath16 where the function @xmath17 has been introduced by chandrasekhar @xcite .",

    "this contribution will lead to a periastron advance already at newtonian order .",
    "+ in general , the direction of the star s spin wo nt be conserved , which complicates the analysis enormeously .",
    "however , one might assume scenarios where the spin is parallel to the angular momentum of the system , i.e. perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "in these cases eq .",
    "( [ hqgen ] ) takes a rather simple form , @xmath22 and we shall restrict to this special situation further on .",
    "+ before we proceed it is important to compare the perturbation introduced by quadrupole coupling with the first post - newtonian correction terms to the eom .",
    "let us assume a spinning binary system in a circular orbit .",
    "not taking into account the @xmath3-coupling the orbital energy reads . ]",
    "@xmath23 comparing @xmath24 with the coupling energy we find that the @xmath3-term offers a contribution comparable to the 1pn orbital perturbation if @xmath25 if @xmath26 is much larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath27 the newtonian quadrupole contribution will clearly dominate , while for @xmath28 the leading perturbation to the keplerian orbit comes from the post - newtonian correction terms .",
    "the value of @xmath3 crucially depends on the density distribution ( via @xmath12 ) and on the angular velorcity of the rotating star .",
    "the later one is bounded by the mass - shedding limit . for a newtonian star with a polytropic eos",
    "one can show that the mass - shedding limit is given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath10 is the polar radius of the star .",
    "thus , for polytropic stars @xmath3 is bounded by @xmath30 for a typical neutron star with polytropic index @xmath31 and polar radius @xmath32 km the maximal value of @xmath3 is @xmath33 km@xmath34 , while for a white dwarf with @xmath35 and a radius of 1000 km this value is given by the constant of apsidal motion is @xmath36 , for @xmath35 one finds @xmath37 . ]",
    "@xmath38 km@xmath34 .",
    "now the post - newtonian approximation is valid only outside the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "for compact binaries a calculation of @xmath39 in full general relativity has not been successfull until now , but post - newtonian analysis suggests a value around @xmath40 . ] . for finite size binaries",
    "the orbital separation should be considerably larger than this value . to be more precisely ,",
    "since we do not consider mass overflow the spinning star should remain well inside it s roche volume throughout this calculation . taking this into account",
    "it becomes clear that for close ns - bh and ns - ns binaries the contribution of the quadrupole coupling is by a factor 100 or more smaller than the first post - newtonian correction .",
    "however , at least for sufficiently fast rotation the @xmath3-term gives rise to perturbations which are considerably larger than the 1.5 pn order .",
    "for spinning white dwarfs things can be different . in that case the finite size contribution due to rotational deformation can be equal or even larger than the pn contribution .",
    "+ these preliminary considerations showed that there might exist close compact binary systems for which the finite size effects introduced by rotational deformation are in the same range as the first post - newtonian correction . employing this assumption we shall now derive the quasi - keplerian parametrization at the first post - newtonian order including leading order quadrupole coupling ( further on denoted as @xmath3-coupling ) . introducing the reduced energy and angular momentum , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , the 1pn conserved energy including newtonian @xmath3-coupling reads @xmath43 + \\frac{1}{c^2}\\left [     \\frac{3}{8}(1 - 3\\nu){\\boldsymbol{v}}^4 + \\frac{g{\\mathcal{m}}}{2r}\\left\\ {",
