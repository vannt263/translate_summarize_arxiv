    "therefore , there is no significant long - term phase periodic modulation of period @xmath46 - 8 years and the @xmath46.5 year `` period '' is highly likely to be an artifact from the phase jitter and the observation gaps between 1976 sas-3 and 1985 exosat ( @xmath43500 d , 1.5 period ) , 1985 exosat and 1989 ginga ( @xmath41300 d , 0.5 period ) , and the 1989 ginga and 1991 rosat ( @xmath41400 d , 0.5 period ) observations .    in explaining the discrepancy between the positive period derivative predicted by the standard scenario vs. the negative observed @xmath23 , van der klis et al .",
    "( 1993b ) demonstrated that the negative phase shift could be due to a long - term variation of the disk size .",
    "the proposal can be tested by looking for a dependence of orbital phase on @xmath35 ( van der klis et al .",

    "we compared the 11 minute modulation phases from the 1996 - 1997 the rxte observations and the simultaneous count rates from the rxte all sky monitor ( except february 9 1997 observation which has no all sky monitor data ) .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient is only 0.17 , which implies that the uncorrelated probability is about 70% . therefore , no significant correlation between binary orbital phases and luminosities is observed .",
    "further considerations about the phase shift are given in section 4 .",
    "grindlay ( 1986 , 1988 ) suggested that the period of @xmath4176 d long - term modulation of 4u 1820@xmath030 ( pt84 ) may be due to a hierarchical triple companion star ( captured by the compact binary in the high density cluster core ) which modulates the eccentricity of the inner binary at a long - term period @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 refer to the binary period and the orbital period of the third companion and k is a constant of order unity which depends on mass ratios and relative inclinations ( mazah and shaham 1979 ) . under the triple model",
    ", with 176 d long - term modulation and 685 sec binary orbital period , the theoretical orbital period of the third star in the 4u 1820@xmath030 system would be @xmath41.1 d ( for k@xmath401 , however , factors of 2 smaller or larger periods for the triple companion could be accommodated for differing inclination ) .",
    "if 4u 1820@xmath030 is a triple system , the 685 sec modulations would be affected by such a period and the beat side bands should appear near the peak of the power spectrum .",
    "we considered the binary motion around the center of mass of triple system . for the third companion star of mass @xmath40.5m@xmath41 ( approximate maximum allowed by the optical counterpart ) and @xmath41.1 d orbital period ,",
    "the radius of the binary motion relative to the center of mass of triple system is only @xmath43.4 sin@xmath42 light - second , where @xmath42 is the inclination angle of the orbit of triple companion .",
    "in other words , the observed @xmath41.1 d period phase modulation amplitude is no more than 5@xmath3010@xmath43 .",
    "although the phase variation form the binary motion may be too small to be observed , the third companion star could still affect the light curve in other ways .",
    "if , for example , the third companion star makes the 11 minute modulation amplitude change , @xmath41.1 d beat side bands where n is positive integer and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the binary ( 11 minutes ) and third star period ( @xmath41.1 d ) , respectively .",
    "the first harmonic ( n=1 ) beat side band periods are thus 689.97 seconds ( f=1.45@xmath3010@xmath43 hz ) and 680.10 seconds ( f=1.47@xmath3010@xmath43 hz ) .",
    "the apparent sideband peak in the top plot of figure  [ clean ] are tantalizing but probably due to the @xmath41 d spacing between successive observations .",
    "a longer continuous observation would be required to remove theses alias peaks . ]",
    "amplitudes may be detectable in the fourier spectrum .",
    "to search possible side bands , we considered only the 1996 october 26 to 30 light curves because the observation gaps for the 1997 observations were too significant . to further minimize the observation windows ( from observation gaps and earth occultation ) ,",
    "a one - dimensional clean algorithm described by roberts , lehar & dreher ( 1987 ) was applied to convert for the unequally spaced observations .",
    "we searched an arbitrary wide frequency range between @xmath44 hz ( p=724.6 sec ) and @xmath45 hz ( p=645.2 sec ) with amplitudes greater than 2@xmath46 significance .",

    "the peak has an amplitude of 2.42 @xmath1 0.26 cts / sec and a period of 685.120 sec .",
    "there are no other significant side bands beside this primary peak .",
    "the 1-day average binned light curve for the rxte asm data ( see figure  [ asmlc1d ] ) shows a clear modulation with relatively rapid rise and slow fall in count rate with a @xmath4176 d period .",

    "pt84 reported the 4u 1820@xmath030 long - term modulation period to be 176.4@xmath11.3 d. however , the ephemeris from pt84 ( @xmath47 ) does not match the exosat 1985 august 19/20 4u 1820@xmath030 low state observation ( haberl et al . 1985 ) where the expected minimum ( by ephemeris from pt84 ) was offset by 48 days .",

    "the light curve of the rxte asm data also shows a @xmath40.45 ( 80d ) phase shift ( see top plot of figure  [ asmlc1d ] ) .",
    "the inconsistency may be caused by an incorrect ephemeris ( phase zero epoch , period or both ) or a period drift .    to obtain the best period to describe the 4u 1820@xmath030 rxte asm light curve",
    ", we first applied a fast fourier transformation ( fft ) .",
    "however , because the observation window is only a brief @xmath48.8 cycles ( 1576 days ) , the fft frequency resolution , @xmath48= 1/(1576d)= 0.233 cycle per year , yields the period resolution near 176 d of @xmath49=19.8 d , which is too coarse for @xmath4176 d period modulation .",
    "therefore , the interpolated fourier transformation ( middleditch , geich and kulkarni 1993 ) was applied to further determine the best period .",
    "the fft is only able to show amplitudes of the `` integer '' frequencies ( @xmath50 where n is an integer and t is the total time of the data ) whereas the interpolated fourier may show the amplitude of `` non - integer '' frequencies ( @xmath51 , where r is any real number ) .",

    "the high correlation between the burst activity and the luminosity suggests that the 171 d modulation is stable and indeed an intrinsic luminosity change rather than an extrinsic periodic obscuration .",
    "this luminosity modulation and ( primarily ) its long - term stability supports earlier suggestions for a hierarchical triple companion .",
    "the mass transfer rate is very sensitive to the roche lobe radius , which is proportional to the inner binary separation .",
    "a hierarchical companion third star will induce an eccentricity variation in inner ( 11 minutes ) binary with period @xmath76 ( mazeh and shaham , 1979 ) . when the minimum separation of the inner binary is small , the mass transfer rate and luminosity changes are enhanced . the triple model to 4u 1820@xmath030 system implies a @xmath41.1 d period third companion is responsible for the 171.033 d long - term intensity modulation .",
    "the triple companion star affects the orbital motion of the inner binary through beats of 685 sec binary period and @xmath41.1 d companion star orbital period .",
    "our rxte observations were not sensitive to this because of both data sampling ( @xmath41 d observation gaps ) and the small amplitude expected . an additional test of the triple model could be conducted by a continuous , or optimally sampled long ( 3 - 10 d ) observation of 4u 1820@xmath030 to measure the small ( @xmath43.4 sin@xmath42 light - second , see section 3.2 ) phase shifts , or the possible modulation side bands ( figure  [ clean ] ) without 1 d sampling alias effects .",
