    "these restrictions until recently prevented the detailed study of a statistically significant sample of collapsed haloes at high redshifts . as the observational frontier is pushed to higher and higher redshifts with reports of the detection of galaxies out to @xmath5 @xcite , a deeper understanding of the properties of the dark matter haloes that host these most distant galaxies is critical as well as extremely timely .",

    "we found that the spin distribution at these early epochs can be fit by a log - normal distribution as at lower redshifts .",

    "haloes acquire angular momentum by tidal torques from their neighbors @xcite .",
    "this picture for the acquisition and growth of angular momentum has been shown to be generally accurate in n - body simulations wherein angular momentum initially grows linearly with time @xcite and then slows down at later times @xcite .",
    "linear theory , however , overpredicts the angular momentum when compared to the fully non - linear n - body simulations @xcite .",

    "we find no strong correlation between environment and spin  it is possible to find low spin haloes in very dense environments , and high spin haloes in sparse environments .",

    "interestingly , they find that the trend they report also disappears as they go back to @xmath48",

    "we find that the fitting function in @xcite extrapolated down to these masses and up to these high redshifts , given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the typical collapsing mass at redshift @xmath58 , is not a good fit , and predicts values for the concentration that are too small compared to our estimates from the simulation .",
    "this disagreement is not surprising as bullock et al .",
    "studied higher mass haloes at lower redshifts ( @xmath59 that have had a significant amount of time to merge and virialize .          observed rotation curves",

    "the measured velocity of stars and gas reflects the combined gravitational potential of both the baryons and dark matter in the galaxy . to infer the total mass from an observationally determined rotation curve requires understanding how both types of matter are distributed spatially in galaxies .",
    "@xcite report that for sb - im spirals , rotation curves can be represented by a universal function which is the sum in quadrature of two velocity curves : one from the disc and one from the dark matter halo .",
    "this model is developed further in @xcite , where the dark matter velocity component is strictly a function of the virial mass of the halo .",
    "if , however , the velocity curve of the dark matter halo is dependent on a second parameter , such as @xmath60 , we would expect to find a systematic error in a mass estimate for the galaxy derived from the observed rotation curve .",
    "a relationship between @xmath60 and a characteristic circular velocity can be expected if we consider an alternative spin parameter given in @xcite : @xmath61 , where @xmath15 is the angular momentum inside some radius , @xmath62 , @xmath17 is the mass inside @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the circular velocity at @xmath62 . for the case of a truncated , singular isothermal sphere ,",

    "the bottom panel shows two histograms of @xmath65 , binned by spin .",
    "the peak of the high and low spin curves is offset by 20% in the @xmath8 mass bin , and 10% in the @xmath46 haloes ( not plotted ) .    from a given @xmath65",
    "one can infer a halo mass using the definition of circular velocity such that @xmath67 .",
    "alternatively , one can use published relationships between @xmath65 and @xmath68 such as the power law @xmath69 where @xmath70 from @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "either way , when two halos of the same ( unknown ) mass have different spins , there is a bias in the resulting @xmath65 , which will lead to a bias in the mass estimated from the circular velocity .",
    "* therefore two observed galaxies with differing values of @xmath71 could in fact inhabit dark matter haloes of the same mass but with different spin parameters .",
    "alternately , two galaxies with the same value of @xmath65 could have different masses due to their different spin values .",
    "* we can estimate the extra uncertainty in the halo mass due to the bias induced by @xmath60 . using the circular velocity definition",
    ", we can translate a difference in velocity to a difference in mass : @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the estimated total mass from an observationally measured value of @xmath65 can be off by 20 - 40% arising due to the unknown value of the spin parameter of the dark matter halo that hosts the galaxy .",
    "another well explored correlation at low redshift is between the shapes of dark matter haloes and the spin parameter . here , we investigate the corresponding correlations for these high redshift haloes .",
    "the existence of a correlation between halo shape and spin is likely to have important consequences for the formation of pre - galactic disks in these haloes .",
    "we calculate the sphericity , @xmath73 , and triaxiality , @xmath74 from the eigenvalues ( @xmath75 ) of the normalized moment of inertia tensor , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the distance to the halo center .",
    "the tensor is calculated using only the particles assigned to the halo , not from all particles within the @xmath38 as is often done .",
    "this allows for consistency with our measurements of @xmath60 .",
    "we used the normalized tensor so that we do not weight particles on the outskirts of a halo stronger .",
    "this helps to prevent the halo shape being dominated by residual tidal features from a recent merger or other irregularities found only in the outer regions which are not present in the halo interior .",

    "we show in figure [ normshape ] histograms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 when calculated using both a normalized and unnormalized moment of inertia tensor .",
    "we find that many more halos are significantly aspherical , and halos tend to be less prolate when the shape is found using the unnormalized tensor .",
    "this is contrary to the study in @xcite , which reported no systematic offset in @xmath78 between the two methods .",
    "we note , however , that they only used particles within @xmath80 , rather than all particles assigned to the halo as we do .",
    "therefore , our unnormalized method will have a stronger bias because we include distant particles in the calculation of the halo shape . in",
    "what follows , we use the normalized tensor to calculate the shape of the haloes .",

    "we find that nearly spherical haloes ( values of @xmath78 close to 1 ) are more clustered than the more aspherical haloes .",
    "this trend is stronger for haloes in the @xmath46 mass range than in the @xmath8 mass range .",
    "in the higher mass bin , we find an increase of @xmath2 in the correlation of nearly spherical haloes when compared to the extremely aspherical halo sample . in the lower mass range ,",
    "we report a smaller increase of only @xmath84 .",
    "thus we conclude that our results at high redshift follow trends found at lower redshift @xcite .    unlike the sphericity parameter ,",
    "when we separate haloes into high and low values of @xmath79 , we see little change in @xmath81 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as @xcite find at low redshift an offset in @xmath81 when binning haloes by @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we note that the clustering strength is weaker if an unnormalized moment of inertia tensor is used to calculate @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the haloes .    in figure [ bias ] , we show the bias parameter , @xmath85 as a function of the halo peak height @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the growth function @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compare results from two redshifts ( @xmath7 and @xmath11 ) and from 5 mass bins at each redshift .",
    "we split our haloes according to four properties : @xmath60 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath54 .",
    "we report that the spin parameter has the largest effect on the bias , while the triaxiality has the least .",
    "this implies that angular momentum has the strongest dependence on environment of all these considered variables and will be the source of the largest systematics due to differing environments between haloes .",
    "therefore , baryonic properties that depend on the angular momentum of the host halo should have systematic offsets due to their local environment .",
    "this may play a large role in the formation of the earliest galactic disks , as well as affect semi - analytic models which relate the baryonic spin to the dark matter halo spin ( * ? ? ?",

    "this fits in with the results of @xcite , who suggest that mass is likely not the only parameter that drives the interaction of haloes with their large - scale environment .",
    "in addition to mass measurements , assembly bias will play an important role in feedback at these high redshifts . at the highest redshifts ,",

    "one consequence of our findings is that if angular momentum affects the formation and evolution of these pop iii stars , their feedback effects will show an environmental bias .",
    "thus , the distribution of metals and reionization will be more clustered than otherwise expected .",
    "we also expect that because these stars are the first baryonic objects to collapse , their properties can be expected to have a stronger relationship to their host dark matter halo than galaxies today , which have undergone multiple mergers .",
    "we intend to pursue the consequences of our findings on baryonic results in future work .",
    "our results suggest that the angular momentum properties of dark matter haloes likely have consequences for the properties of the first stars and galaxies hosted by them .",
    "this work was supported in part by the facilities and staff of the yale university faculty of arts and sciences high performance computing center .",
    "we also wish to thank zheng zheng , laurie shaw , jason tumlinson , elena donghia , and lars hernquist for helpful discussions and comments ."

    "<S> we also present detailed convergence tests for individual haloes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that high spin haloes have stronger clustering strengths ( up to @xmath1 ) at all mass and redshift ranges at these early epochs . </S>",
    "<S> high redshift spherical haloes are also up to @xmath2 more clustered than extremely aspherical haloes . </S>",
    "<S> high spin haloes at these redshifts are also preferentially found in high density environments , and have more neighbors than their low spin counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we report a systematic offset in the peak of the circular velocity curves for high and low spin haloes of the same mass . therefore , estimating halo masses without knowledge of the spin , using only the circular velocity can yield errors of up to @xmath3 . </S>",
