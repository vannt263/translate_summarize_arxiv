    "as is well known , the main approximation underlying mean - field theories of phase transitions consists in neglecting any spatial dependence of the order parameter . in simple systems such as fluids or ferromagnets",
    "this leads to an equation of state ( e.g. the van der waals equation ) that exhibits a continuous loop below the critical temperature @xmath1 . in this framework",
    ", one can distinguish between stable ( equilibrium ) , metastable , and unstable states .",
    "the intermediate , unstable branch of the loop is associated with maxima of the free energy and has a negative slope ( whence a negative susceptibility ) , and the unstable and metastable regions of the phase diagram are separated by a spinodal line where the free - energy barrier vanishes . whereas the concept of metastability can be in some sense extended to systems with short - range interaction in finite dimensions where it becomes a matter of timescales , the unstable branch is a complete artifact of the mean - field approximation and the _ homogeneous _ states along this branch do not represent any real physical situation .",
    "things are different in the presence of disorder since inhomogeneities are induced even at a microscopic scale . as a result , configurations formed by a multitude of small domains of the two phases can become metastable in an extended range of the `` external '' field ( e.g. the fluid pressure or the magnetic field ) .",
    "interestingly , this can already occur at the mean - field level and the purpose of this paper is to emphazise that metastable states are present _ all along _ the so - called unstable branch in the mean - field random field ising model ( rfim ) at @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is in fact a precursor of what happens in the rfim in finite dimensions , and it has consequences for experiments in actual random - field systems at low temperature .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath2 ising spins ( @xmath3 ) interacting via the hamiltonian [ eq01 ] h=-_ijs_i s_j-_i ( h_i+h)s_i where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a uniform external field , and @xmath6 is a collection of random fields drawn identically and independently from some probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "( in the following , we consider a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath8 . )",
    "this mean - field model can be obtained from the usual short - range rfim by placing the spins on a fully - connected lattice ( the connectivity is then equal to @xmath9 and the exchange interaction is rescaled by @xmath2 to ensure a proper thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) can be also rewritten as [ eq02 ] h=-_i f_i s_i where @xmath10 is the effective field acting on each spin @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the magnetization per spin .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the equilibrium properties of this model by the replica method , without all the complications that plague the case of random exchange . in particular",
    ", the average magnetization in the thermodynamic limit @xmath13 is solution of the self - consistent equation@xcite    [ eq03 ] m(h)=(h ) dh where @xmath14 .",
    "( in ref.@xcite , only the case @xmath15 is considered , but the generalization to @xmath16 is straightforward . ) at @xmath0 , the equation becomes    [ eq04 ] m_0(h)&=(h )   ( jm_0(h)+h+h)dh + & = 2p(m_0(h))-1 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this yields @xmath19/\\delta \\sqrt{2})$ ] in the case of the gaussian distribution , where @xmath20 is the error function .",
    "since the magnetization per spin is a self - averaging quantity , @xmath21 is also the expected value of the magnetization in a very large sample .",
    "below the critical disorder @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for the gaussian distribution ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) has three solutions in a certain range of the field and the curve @xmath21 exhibits a characteristic `` van der waals '' loop with an intermediate branch along which @xmath24 ( see fig . 1 ; we take @xmath25 in all figures ) . as usual , this behavior is associated with the non - convexity of the ( free ) energy . at a given field @xmath5 , the ground - state corresponds to the solution with the lowest overall energy whereas the intermediate branch has to the largest energy . in the space of replica magnetizations@xcite ,",
    "such branch corresponds to an absolute maximum .",
    "the result from the replica method can be shown to be exact@xcite , and it seems natural to describe the intermediate branch as `` unstable '' , naively transposing the situation found in the pure system ( i.e. in the absence of random field ) .",
    "however , this is misleading . indeed , since eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) results from an average over disorder ( which restores translational invariance ) when @xmath26 , it says nothing about the orientation of the spins in a given ( finite @xmath2 ) sample .",
    "it turns out that some of the states along the intermediate branch are metastable ( i.e. _ local _ minima of the energy ) and not unstable . indeed , eq . ( [ eq04 ] )",
    "is trivially verified if [ eq05 ] s_i=(f_i ) _ ,   i=1 ... n , which is the definition of the so - called one - spin - flip stable states .",
    "there is nothing new here : it is known that eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) also describes the nonequilibrium ( hysteretic ) behavior of the mean - field rfim at @xmath0 with the single - spin - flip ( glauber ) dynamics@xcite . as @xmath5",
    "is slowly varied from @xmath27 , this dynamics imposes at any field that the spins with @xmath28 point down whereas the other ones point up , and the self - consistent equation for the average magnetization , @xmath29 , is just eq.([eq04 ] ) .",
    "( note incidentally that this corresponds to an `` annealed '' average , but it yields the correct result in this case . )",
    "the nonequilibrium rfim at @xmath0 has been the subject of extensive studies in recent years@xcite and the mean - field model , despite some peculiar features ( the equilibrium and nonequilibrium critical disorders coincide and there is no hysteresis for @xmath30 ) , has the advantage that many interesting properties can be computed exactly ( for instance the size and duration of avalanches)@xcite . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the nonequilibrium system explores the lower ( or upper ) branch of the loop until @xmath5 reaches one of the two coercive fields where @xmath32 diverges and the magnetization jumps discontinuously .",
    "this `` infinite avalanche '' @xcite occurs when each flipping spin triggers one other spin on average , which corresponds to the condition @xmath33 .",
    "hereafter , we shall use the shorthand @xmath34 for the quantity @xmath35 .",
    "the point that we want to emphasize here is that a configuration where each spin satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq05 ] ) is a metastable state by definition , _ whatever _ the value taken by @xmath21 ( of course , a state on the intermediate branch has a larger energy than the corresponding ground state and it can not be reached by controlling the field ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 that shows the magnetizations of the metastable states in a single sample of size @xmath36 with @xmath37 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "one can see that there are stable states in the intermediate region and that they gather along a curve that will become the so - called `` unstable '' branch in the thermodynamic limit . at a given field @xmath5 ,",
    "the number of these states is very small , obviously not exponentially growing with system size .",
    "however , the probability of finding metastable states remains finite when @xmath13 , as we now show .",
    "for a disorder realization of size @xmath2 , consider the ensemble of metastable configurations at the field @xmath5 with exactly @xmath38 spins up ( and thus an overall magnetization @xmath39 ) .",
    "the number of such configurations is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the heaviside step function and @xmath42 is the kronecker-@xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that there can not be more than one metastable state with magnetization @xmath44 in a single realization ( i.e. @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "averaging over disorder , we have [ eqa1 ] = ( _ p^n)p(m-1/n)^p^n - p  , where the two terms in the right - hand side represent the probabilities of having @xmath38 spins up and @xmath47 spins down at the field @xmath5 , respectively . using the stirling approximation for the factorial and expanding @xmath48 to first order in @xmath49 ,",
    "we find [ eqa2 ] ~e^-jp(-h - jm)[+ ] with [ eqa3 ] ( m)=+  .",
    "this number is exponentially small ( @xmath50 ) except when @xmath51 , i.e. when @xmath52 is solution of eq.([eq04 ] ) : @xmath53 is then maximum and equal to @xmath54 .",
    "expanding @xmath53 to second order close to @xmath55 , we find that the average number of metastable states at the field @xmath5 is finite when @xmath13 and is given by @xmath56    this result is valid both above and below @xmath22 , and for @xmath31 the three branches of @xmath21 must be considered separately ( with @xmath57 along the intermediate branch ) . the behavior of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath21 is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath58 diverges at the coercive fields ( i.e. at the spinodal endpoints ) where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ^ 2/(1-m_0 ^ 2)=0 $ ] ( from now on , the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath5 will not be indicated for brevity ) .",
    "in this case , the large - deviation function @xmath53 must be expanded to fourth order about @xmath63 and @xmath58 scales like @xmath64 . at the critical point ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , @xmath53",
    "must be expanded to the sixth order and @xmath58 scales like @xmath67 .",
    "the special form of @xmath53 is responsible for these unusual mean - field exponents .",
    "note that it is crucial to take into account the contributions of order @xmath49 in the local fields @xmath68 in order to obtain the correct result .",
    "this is due to the fact that the function @xmath53 is zero at the saddle - point , so that the associated complexity is zero .",
    "( this is different from the situation found in the mean - field spin glass model discussed in ref.@xcite . )",
    "on the other hand , the subdominant terms play no role in determining the probability of finding a metastable state with magnetization @xmath52 at the field @xmath5 , which is only given as usual by the fluctuations around the saddle point : [ eqa5 ] ~ e^(m_0)(m - m_0)^2  .",
    "this becomes a @xmath43-distribution when @xmath26 if @xmath69 .",
    "more generally , we can compute all the moments @xmath70 and use this information to obtain the full probability distribution @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) .",

    "the notation @xmath82 indicates that the sum over the magnetizations @xmath83 is restricted to a specific order , say @xmath84 .",

    ", the presence of metastable states ( and not simply unstable ones as in pure systems ) in the central part of the hysteresis loop means that this region could be experimentally accessible , for instance by controlling the magnetization instead of the magnetic field ( and more generally the extensive variable conjugated to the external field ) .",
