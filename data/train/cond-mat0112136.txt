    "there has been significant progress in exploring the concept of molecular electronics in recent years , due to the advancement of techniques for characterizing and manipulating individual molecules  @xcite .",
    "the fact that useful devices can be built on the basis of individual molecules , as demonstrated recently by several research groups  @xcite , has generated wide - spread interest in this new technology . in order to fulfil the true promise of molecular electronics ,",
    "it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the electronic and transport processes at the single molecule level .",
    "this paper represents an attempt to put our understanding of electronic transport through individual molecules on a firm theoretical basis starting from the first - principles .",
    "traditionally electron transport phenomena are studied in the context of bulk semiconductor devices , the theoretical description of which is largely built upon two premises : ( 1 ) the effective - mass equation and ( 2 ) the boltzmann transport equation ( bte )  @xcite .",
    "the effective - mass equation subsumes the effect of the background periodic lattice potential into an effective hamiltonian so that the electrons can be considered as particles of effective mass @xmath0 in some applied field .",
    "the semi - classical nature of the electronic motion in the bulk devices , on the other hand , allows us to describe the distribution of electrons in response to the applied fields and various scattering mechanisms through the solution of the bte equation , in much the same way as that of classical point - like particles . within this approach ,",
    "the quantum - mechanical effect only comes in through the calculation of band structures and the various carrier scattering rates , which provides the input to the solution of the bte or its approximate versions such as the drift - diffusion equation . as a result ,",
    "the study of transport phenomena is effectively decoupled from the study of the electronic structures .",
    "the investigation of quantum mechanical transport has begun to flourish during the past two decades , largely due to the advancement in lithographic techniques which has allowed routine fabrication of submicron features in artificially tailored semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "two quantum mechanical effects distinguish such mesoscopic devices from bulk devices , reflecting the wave - particle duality of electron .",
    "one is the quantization of electronic charge which evidences itself in coulomb blockade and single - electron transistors  @xcite .",
    "the other is the preservation of quantum phase coherence over a length with size comparable to one of the device dimensions and the resulting energy quantization of confined electrons , which leads to the observation of conductance quantization in transport through a narrow constriction ( quantum point contact ) and negative differential resistance in double - barrier tunneling structures ( resonant - tunneling diode ) .",
    "transport in these quantum semiconductor structures is now determined by the scattering property and occupation of the electronic eigenstates under an appropriate external potential .",
    "on the other hand , electrons in such quantum semiconductor structures are usually confined in one or two directions .",
    "the confinement potential , often the electrostatic potential due to a nearby gate or the band discontinuity across the heterostructure interface , varies slowly on the atomic scale . so the electrons can still be described satisfactorily as free carriers using the single - band effective mass approximation and most of the important phenomena in mesoscopic transport can be understood without worrying about the complex electronic structures  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when we consider molecular electronic devices formed by sandwiching a chemically synthesized molecule between two large ( on the molecular scale ) metallic electrodes . at the molecular scale ,",
    "the simplicity associated with the effective - mass approximation breaks down and the electronic structure of the system has to be taken explicitly into account .",
    "the quantum mechanical scattering problem involved is now the scattering of electrons under the potential of the atomic nuclei _ and _ the potential due to other electrons .",
    "understanding transport in such molecular devices therefore requires a knowledge of the microscopic electronic structure of the electrode - molecule - electrode system under both zero and finite bias voltages .",
    "the reduction to molecular scale also brings in another complication in transport study as compared to the mesoscopic systems : treatment of the interface to an external contact . in mesoscopic transport , the details of contact are often not important .",
    "the measuring electrodes , taken as infinite electron reservoirs , can either be simulated by reflectionless semi - infinite leads with simple confinement potential at the interface , or only come into the theoretical formulation as an appropriate boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "this is no longer true when the device is of molecular dimension .",
    "since the electrodes can have atomic structures on the surface whose dimensions can be comparable to the molecule , the usually well - defined boundary between the active device region and the contact region is blurred .",
    "the interface to the external contact becomes an integral part of the device and the measured electrical characteristics will depend on the details of the atomic arrangement of the contact .",
    "moreover , the electronic and structural properties of the molecule could be modified by the bonding to the measuring contact , bringing in additional complications  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "molecular electronic devices are different from their mesoscopic counterparts in two important aspects : ( 1 ) the effect of the electronic structure and ( 2 ) the effect of the interface to the external contact .",
    "since the molecule can freely exchange energy and electrons with the electrodes , a rigorous treatment of molecular electronic device can only be achieved including these effects in the context of an open system . as a result , a successful modeling of molecular electronic devices in",
    "general calls for combining the theory of quantum transport and the theory of electronic structure starting from first - principles .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical works on transport through individual molecules describing the electronic structure at different levels .",
    "early works have focused on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of transport in the molecular - scale and developing simple theory for the explanation of experimental results  @xcite .",
    "these works thus were centered on model hamiltonian or semi - empirical theories ( notably the extended - hckel - theory of organic molecules  @xcite and @xmath1-electron tight - binding theory of carbon nanotubes  @xcite ) . due to the interdisciplinary nature of molecular electronics , different methods",
    "have been used reflecting the authors own background which are essentially all equivalent to the landauer formula of mesoscopic transport  @xcite as used extensively in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "such works have provided useful insights into the factors governing transport through individual molecules . however , the usefulness of this approach is limited by its incapability of providing an accurate description of the electronic structure of the molecule and the metal surface involved . even if a good parameterization exists for the molecule and the bulk separately , the charge transfer and the resulting self - consistent charge and potential relaxation upon the formation of surface and adsorption of the molecule is difficult to treat unless drastic assumptions are made or additional parameters are introduced . in addition , it is difficult to take into account coupling between electrons and molecular vibrational modes which is expected to play an increasingly important role as the molecular size increases  @xcite .",
    "more recently , lang and coworkers  @xcite have presented self - consistent studies of both the conductance and current - voltage characteristics of atomic and molecular wires using the jellium model of a metal surface and the local - density - approximation ( lda ) of density functional theory ( dft ) with plane - wave basis set .",
    "the calculation proceeds by recasting the kohn - sham equation of the electrode - molecule - electrode system into a scattering form using the lippmann - schwinger equation and solving the wavefunctions of the scattering state self - consistently  @xcite .",
    "the current is obtained by summing over the contribution of the scattering states which are occupied according to the fermi distribution in each electrode , following the spirit of landauer theory .",
    "similar approaches have also been used by tsukada and coworkers  @xcite and guo and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the jellium model has an appealing and physically reasonable simplicity : all the complexities of the bulk band structure are simply ignored , the effect of the substrate persists only in providing a continuous energy spectrum and the only inhomogeneity left in the metal region is the essential one - dimensional inhomogeneity of the surface itself .",
    "however , the jellium model is known to be deficient in describing the electronic density of states and charge density in the region perturbed by the absorbed molecule even for sp - bonded simple metals for which it is more successful  @xcite , and it can not answer questions regarding the effect of adsorption geometry and surface relaxation . in addition , it is not applicable to semiconductors and gives serious quantitative error when applied to noble and transition metals where the bonding at the surface is more directional .",
    "the use of the plane - wave basis set and the wavefunction formulation also make it difficult to treat larger molecular systems , to improve the description of the electronic structure and to include other scattering mechanisms .",
    "the objective of this paper is to present a rigorous yet tractable self - consistent matrix green s function ( mgf ) approach for studying transport in molecular electronic devices , through which many limitations of the previous works can be overcome rather conveniently using existing computational techniques . in particular , this allows us to use existing quantum chemical methods for transport calculation with minimum change .",
    "the method is based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism of quantum transport  @xcite and the density - functional - theory of electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "we also use the technique of expansion in a finite set of local orbital functions .",
    "the non - equilibrium green s function formalism has proved to be a powerful and formally rigorous approach to studying quantum transport phenomena in nanodevices , where the devices can be characterized as a small active device region connected to electron reservoirs via non - interacting leads .",
    "arbitrary interactions in the device can be included  @xcite .",
    "for non - interacting electron systems in the coherent limit , it reduces to the familiar landauer theory of mesoscopic transport  @xcite .",
    "the formalism is fairly complete , and it has been applied successfully to studying quantum - mechanical transport phenomena in semiconductor mesoscopic systems such as resonant - tunneling diode and single - electron transistors  @xcite , usually in combination with a model hamiltonian and more recently using semi - empirical tight - binding formulations  @xcite . for molecular electronic devices , within the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the problem is to calculate the green s function of the interacting electron system under the potential of the given configuration of atomic nuclei and external fields .",
    "the study of molecular electronic devices is greatly facilitated by recognizing the fact that due to the metallic screening in the electrodes , the charge and potential perturbation induced by the adsorption of the molecule extends over only a finite region into the electrodes , practically the region enclosing the surface metal atoms closest to the molecule .",
    "the charge and potential distributions beyond this region are the same as that of the bimetallic interfaces without the molecules . by expanding the wavefunction in terms of the finite",
    "set of local atomic orbital functions , the matrix green s function approach allows us to take full advantage of this spatial locality by separating the device into the `` extended - molecule '' ( which includes the molecule itself and the surface atoms perturbed by the molecule ) and the electrode region , the description of each can be treated and systematically improved independent of each other .",
    "the effect of the external contact can be included rigorously as a self - energy operator , which depends only on the charge and potential distribution outside the `` extended molecule '' and needs to be computed only once , thereby the computation can be focused on the physical processes happening in the finite `` extended molecule '' region .",
    "this not only opens up the possibility of using the full repertoire of molecular electronic structure calculation for studying transport in molecular electronic devices , but also allows us to interpret the result of computation using the simple picture of bonding and orbital interactions in molecules , which is necessary for the computation to be useful in terms of understanding rather than pure numbers .",
    "although we will focus on the density - functional theory of the interacting electron system , the formalism does nt depend on the particular description of the electronic structure .    in matrix form ,",
    "the present formulation is equivalent to previous works using semi - empirical tight - binding formulations  @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding formulation provides a conceptually and computationally simple framework for studying transport in systems where a quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure is necessary but the characteristic length scale is much larger than inter - atomic spacing so atomic - scale details are not needed .",
    "example systems include layered semiconductor devices and long carbon nanotubes .",
    "the present formulation keeps the simplicity of the tight - binding approach while putting it on a firm theoretical basis .",
    "the explicit use of the local basis function in the real space also allows much more detailed understanding of the physical processes through quantities such as the spatial distribution of charge and current densities , which play the fundamental role in density - functional theory and its time - dependent extension  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ambiguities associated with the semi - empirical formulation , such as the orthogonality of the basis functions used in such formulation and the treatment of self - consistent charge - transfer effect  @xcite , can be avoided .",
    "when the potentials and the integrals are calculated approximately rather than from first principles , it can also serve as the basis of improved self - consistent tight - binding approaches capable of handling much larger systems  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we discuss briefly the use of non - equilibrium green s function and density - functional theory for modeling transport in molecular devices in sec .",
    "the matrix green s function method is described in sec .",
    "the self - consistent formulation for device at equilibrium is given in sec .",
    "iv , where we show that our method provides an alternative and generalizing approach to the familiar chemisorption problem in surface physics .",
    "the self - consistent formulation for a device out of equilibrium is given in sec .",
    "v. finally , we devote sec .",
    "vi to conclusions .",
    "we use atomic - units throughout this paper unless otherwise noted .",
    "as current flows , the device is driven out of equilibrium . for systems out of equilibrium",

    "the green s functions involved , besides the retarded and advanced green s function , @xmath3 include the correlation function ( or the `` lesser '' green s function ) which is the central quantity in this formalism @xmath4 any physical observable can be obtained from @xmath5 and its transformations .",
    "for example , the quantities of most interest to us , the charge density @xmath6 and the current density @xmath7 , are determined as following : @xmath8 and @xmath9    for steady state , which we consider here , the green s functions depend only on the time difference @xmath10 , which we can fourier transform to energy .",

    ", we will be able to calculate the current distribution within the device given the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "however , in general , they involve the evaluation of the full correlation function and the retarded green s function _ in the presence of tunneling into the leads_. the usefulness of the above expressions then depends on whether we can devise practical calculation schemes for the single - particle green s functions . for molecular - scale devices ,",
    "the problem is to determine the state of the interacting electron system under the potential of the given atomic nuclei . by separating the term describing the electron interactions into the classical coulomb part and the exchange - correlation part",

    "the system is characterized by the highly non - equilibrium distribution in the device region , which is driven by contact to two large reserviors with different electrochemical potential .",
    "a truly first - principles treatment of the electronic processes in such non - equilibrium system can only be based on the non - equilibrium version of the many - body perturbation theory such as the quasi - particle theory  @xcite or perhaps the time - dependent density - functional theory  @xcite .",
    "such a first - principles theory does nt exist yet .",
    "instead , we will work with density - functional theory  @xcite .",
    "the theory of dft is based on the study of systems in their ground state or in thermodynamic equilibrium corresponding to the grand canonical ensemble , where the variational formulation of quantum mechanics can be used . for transport through non - interacting systems",
    ", the problem can be solved by working in the scattering state representation , since electrons coming from different electrodes are in separate thermodynamic equilibrium at different electrochemical potentials .",
    "this is the essence of the landauer theory of quantum transport . in this case",
    ", it may be justified to use density - functional theory to calculate the scattering state wavefunctions which correspond to a two - component system , each characterized by a well - defined thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "however , we are not aware of any formal proof of this .",
    "in fact , this has been the basis for the use of dft to calculate current and conductance in the past  @xcite . for the interacting electron system which dft attempts to describe , the nonlinear current - voltage characteristic can be obtained only by doing perturbation theory in the part of the hamiltonian that drives the system out of equilibrium . for these reasons",
    ", the use of the dft formalism , with probably the exception of its time - dependent extension  @xcite , in transport calculations can only be taken as _ qualitative in principle _ , although this does nt preclude its _ quantitative success in practice_.    from here on , we will work with density functional theory in our modeling of molecular devices , with the understanding that we approximate the true self - energy operator for exchange - correlation interaction with the dft description of exchange - correlation potential  @xcite .",
    "we will treat the usage of dft in a more qualitative sense in that it has a well - defined physical basis , from which we know where it can be expected to succeed and where it may fail and why .",
    "therefore we will put more emphasis on using the results of such calculation for qualitative understanding whenever possible .",
    "these results may serve as the basis for further improvement as our understanding of molecular devices progresses .",
    "the reason for this choice is therefore _",
    "practical , rather than fundamental_.",
    "our starting point is the keldysh - kadanoff - baym equation ( eq .",

    "<S> transport in molecular electronic devices is different from that in semiconductor mesoscopic devices in two important aspects : ( 1 ) the effect of the electronic structure and ( 2 ) the effect of the interface to the external contact </S>",
    "<S> . a rigorous treatment of molecular electronic devices will require the inclusion of these effects in the context of an open system exchanging particle and energy with the external environment . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for combining the theory of quantum transport with the theory of electronic structure starting from the first - principles . </S>",
    "<S> we present a rigorous yet tractable matrix green s function approach for studying transport in molecular electronic devices , based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism of quantum transport and the density - functional theory of electronic structure using local orbital basis sets . by separating the device rigorously into the molecular region and the contact region , </S>",
    "<S> we can take full advantage of the natural spatial locality associated with the metallic screening in the electrodes and focus on the physical processes in the finite molecular region . </S>",
    "<S> this not only opens up the possibility of using the existing well - established technique of molecular electronic structure theory in transport calculations with little change , but also allows us to use the language of qualitative molecular orbital theory to interpret and rationalize the results of the computation . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the importance of the self - consistent charge transfer and voltage drop on the transport characteristics and describe the self - consistent formulation for both device at equilibrium and device out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> for the device at equilibrium , our method provides an alternative approach for solving the molecular chemisorption problem . for the device out of equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the calculation of elastic current transport through molecules , both conceptually and computationally , is no more difficult than solving the chemisorption problem . </S>"
