    "models of the interior structure of jovian planets in our solar system suggest that jupiter and saturn would contain much more amount of heavy elements in their envelopes than that assuming the solar metallicity @xcite .",

    "however , the orbital calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) showed that the coupled effect of excitation of planetesimals eccentricities due to gravitational scattering by the planet and their damping by aerodynamical and/or dynamical drag tends to open up a gap in the planetesimal disk , resulting in truncation of planetesimal infall onto the planet s gas envelope .",
    "@xcite _ a priori _ assumed the maximally efficient planetesimal accretion during gas accretion phase .",
    "as a result of increase in the planet s mass , the width of its feeding zone , which is proportional to cubic root of the mass , expands .",
    "they assumed that planetesimals in the expanded zones are accreted with the fastest rate for circular orbits of planetesimals .",
    "their assumption can be consistent with the anticipated metal - rich envelopes of jupiter and saturn , but is inconsistent with the eccentricity excitation and gap formation shown by the above orbital integrations .    furthermore , the assumption of the maximal planetesimal accretion results in long `` phase 2 '' that is very inefficient gas accretion phase before onset of runaway gas accretion . as explained in  2",
    ", envelope contraction starts when core s mass ( @xmath1 ) becomes larger than a critical core mass ( @xmath2 ) . for @xmath3 , pressure gradient no more supports envelope gas hydrodynamically against the increased core s gravity @xcite .",

    "[ [ eq : crit_core_mass ] ] ) , after the onset of envelope contraction .",
    "the quasi - hydrodynamical state is called `` phase 2 '' and it may last for more than myrs . however , the inefficient gas accretion would be inconsistent with the ubiquity of extrasolar giant planets @xcite .    recently , likelihood of phase 2 is re - addressed .",
    "@xcite showed that even if the gap formation is neglected , more realistic planetesimal accretion rate based on oligarchic growth @xcite significantly suppresses the duration of phase 2 .",
    "@xcite showed that planetesimals around a protoplanet with @xmath4 are gravitationally shepherded and can not be accreted .",
    "it suggests non - existence of phase 2 .",
    "they also showed that the anticipated metal - rich envelopes of jupiter and saturn is not inconsistent with it , because such shepherding occurs only in early stages .",
    "the planet starts accreting planetesimals when its mass becomes comparable to that of gas giants because the planetesimals trapped in mean - motion resonances are released by resonance overlapping due to the planet s mass increase .",
    "the planetesimal accretion no more halts gas accretion onto such a massive planet . through numerical simulations with two different simple gas accretion prescriptions",
    ", they estimated that total accreted mass can be as large as several earth masses .",
    "the idea by @xcite reconciled the efficient formation of gas giants with the anticipated metal - rich envelope .",
    "however , since they showed only numerical results with limited prescriptions for gas accretion , it is not clear that the accreted planetesimal mass for more realistic gas accretion rate is as much as that they obtained . furthermore , they discussed suppression of phase 2 only qualitatively .",
    "as shown below , the planetesimal accretion rate does depend on gas accretion speed as well as the planet s mass .",
    "hence , for evaluation of amount of planetesimal infall for more realistic gas accretion models and quantitative discussion on the suppression of `` phase 2 , '' general formulae for gas accretion rate as a function of the planet s mass ( @xmath5 ) and its increase rate ( @xmath6 ) is needed .    in the present paper , through orbital integrations , we clarify the physical mechanism to determine the planetesimal accretion rate and derive detailed semi - analytical formulae for the accretion rate as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the conclusion is in  5 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , when the core mass becomes larger than a critical core mass , pressure gradient no more supports envelope gas hydrodynamically against the core s gravity and hydrostatic atmosphere does not exist .",
    "after that , heat generation due to gas envelope contraction itself supports the envelope against dynamical collapse , thus the envelope undergoes quasi - static contraction .",
    "the contraction allows gas inflow from the disk into bondi radius of the planet , so that the contraction rate is almost equal to gas accretion rate of the planet .    here , we briefly summarize the prescriptions for this process for later use .",

[ [ eq : size - independent_accretion_rate ] ] ) . in the figure , we plot the accreted planetesimal mass @xmath194 for @xmath195 and @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the physical radius for mass @xmath5 and @xmath56g@xmath57 . for other @xmath125 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the accreted mass is @xmath198 .",
    "all the results show similar qualitative features of evolution of @xmath186 .",
    "planetesimal accretion is inhibited in early stages by gap formation , but rapid planetary growth due to gas accretion in later stages allows planetesimal accretion . with @xmath199 yrs , @xmath200 both for jupiter and saturn . for shorter @xmath40 , @xmath186 is smaller due to easier gap formation .",
    "we also did calculations starting from different core masses .",
    "the resultant @xmath186 hardly changed , because @xmath201 is negligibly small when @xmath5 is small and gap is opened .",
    "the amount of predicted @xmath186 can be as large as that inferred from the internal structure model @xcite , if the planets are inflated and/or relatively large @xmath60 is considered .",
    "for the same @xmath5 , @xmath54 and @xmath60 , @xmath186 is larger for larger @xmath64 .",
    "although saturnian mass is @xmath202 of jovian mass , our model predicts that the mass of planetesimals falling into saturnian envelope is comparable to that into jovian envelope .",
    "more detailed internal structure models will test our prediction .",
    "so far , we have assumed that gas accretion immediately starts when @xmath1 exceeds @xmath2 without undergoing `` phase 2 . '' in the previous subsection , we predicted the planetesimal accretion rate as a function of planetary mass based on the realistic gas accretion model . with this accretion rate , we show that `` phase 2 '' is not likely to occur .    in the nominal model ( j1 model ) in @xcite , @xmath203 , @xmath188au and @xmath204 .",
    "then , they found that @xmath205yr is maintained during `` phase 2 '' with their maximally efficient planetesimal accretion model .",
    "as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit_core_mass ] ) , this @xmath7 can marginally support gas envelope around a @xmath206 core .",
    "first , we derive the condition for gap opening with a realistic @xmath18 given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : ikoma_model ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) , @xmath207 with @xmath188au , @xmath208 and @xmath184 yrs , we obtain @xmath209 .",
    "then , the gap should be opened up .",
    "our formula for @xmath177 gives @xmath210 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ikoma_model ] ) into this equation , @xmath211 for @xmath184 yrs , @xmath203 , @xmath188au and @xmath212 , @xmath213yr , which is one order smaller than the planetesimal accretion rate that @xcite assumed .",
    "we examine the possibility of phase 2 for other @xmath214 and @xmath64 . for phase 2 to occur",
    ", @xmath7 must be maintained to be as large as @xmath6 for @xmath4 .",
    "core mass can be approximately identified by core isolation mass beyond the ice line @xcite , @xmath215 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit_core_mass ] ) with the exponent derived by assuming eq .",
    "( [ eq : ikoma_model ] ) , the accretion rate required by occurrence of phase 2 is @xmath216 substituting @xmath217 into @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta2 ] ) , @xmath218 so , @xmath177 is equivalent to @xmath219 for this range of @xmath60 and @xmath220au ( the ice line ) , eq .",

    "( [ eq : mdot_phase_2 ] ) ( see figure [ fig : phase2 ] ) . for @xmath171 , on the other hand , @xmath222 in the range of @xmath60 and @xmath64 that satisfy @xmath171 , eq .  ( [ mdot_nogap ] ) can reach @xmath221 only at @xmath223au and @xmath224 , in which gas giant formation is unlikely @xcite .",
    "thus , the predicted @xmath225 never reaches the values required for phase 2 .",
    "we conclude that phase 2 is not likely to occur for formation of giant planets .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the ubiquity of extrasolar gas giant planets .",
    "we have investigated the planetesimal accretion rate onto growing giant planets through numerical simulations and analytical arguments .",
    "the planet mass ( @xmath5 ) is increased with assumed gas accretion rate onto the planet , and orbits of planetesimals in the vicinity of the planet s orbit are integrated with the effect of gas drag , but without self - gravity of the planetesimals .",
    "we first performed simulations with several different artificial gas accretion rates to clarify intrinsic physics determining the planetesimal accretion rate .",
    "a gap in the planetesimal disk is opened by a coupling effect of gravitational scattering by the planet and gas drag damping . here",
    ", the gap formation means that most planetesimals are get out of the feeding zone of the planet .",
    "the scattering increases both @xmath47 and @xmath97 keeping jacobi energy constant , where @xmath47 is orbital eccentricity and @xmath97 is difference in semimajor axis between the planet and the planetesimals .",
    "changes in @xmath47 and @xmath226 are of the same order , where @xmath67 is reduced hill radius defined by @xmath227 . since the gas drag predominantly damps @xmath47 after the scattering , the gap is formed . on the other hand ,",
    "the width of the feeding zone is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the planet growth inhibits gap formation and competes with the scattering / damping process .",
    "we derived the condition for the gap formation by comparison between the eccentricity damping rate ( @xmath138 ) and the rate of expansion of the feeding zone due to the planet growth ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "when @xmath228 , the gap is not formed .",
    "then , the planetesimal accretion rate ( @xmath229 ) is scaled by the ratio of the scattering rate @xmath137 to @xmath139 .",
    "the numerical results are fitted as @xmath230 where @xmath125 is physical radius of the planet and @xmath60 is a scaling factor for surface density of the planetesimals ( eq .  [ [ eq : surface_mass_density ] ] ) . when the gap is formed ( @xmath231 ) , the accretion rate is significantly depleted .",
    "we found that the accretion rate is scaled by @xmath232 as @xmath233    applying these formulae to the more realistic gas accretion models described in  2 , we found the followings :    1 .   in early stages",
    "when @xmath234 , a gap is opened in the planetesimal disk . the planetesimal accretion rate is smaller than that required for phase 2 to occur .",
    "this ensures efficient formation of gas giants , which may be consistent with the ubiquity of extrasolar giant planets . 2 .   in later stages ( @xmath235 )",
    ", the expansion of the feeding zone overwhelms the gap opening process , so the gap is filled .",
    "then , the planetesimal accretion becomes efficient .",
    "the amount of infalling planetesimals into the envelopes of jupiter and saturn in the late stages can be as large as several @xmath0 , which may be consistent with interior models for these planets .    in this `` realistic '' model",
    ", we assumed that planetesimals are infinitely supplied .",
    "however , if the accreted mass is significant , planetesimals distributed in the regions inside isolated strong mean motion resonances can be consumed . in that case ,",
    "release of planetesimals from the resonance capture by resonance overlapping due to planet mass increase may also become a important factor @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out the correlation that the amount of solid components of extrasolar transiting gas giants increases with metallicity of their host stars that is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "this trend is consistent with our formulae , because @xmath236 .",
    "as this example shows , the analysis here will give deep insights into formation of extrasolar gas giants and their diversity .",
    "this work is supported by jsps .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath237 in  4.3 is determined by a balance between damping due to the gas drag and excitation due to the planet s perturbations . since in the non - gap case ,",
    "planetesimals are engulfed by the feeding zone mainly through the parameter range of @xmath148 , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattering_velocity ] ) for definition of the parameter @xmath166 .",
    "however , gap opening is caused by damping of relatively high orbital eccentricity , so we use the formula of excitation of planetesimal eccentricity due to the protoplanet s perturbations for @xmath238 , in evaluating @xmath135 .",
    "then the scattering timescale is given approximately by chandrasekahr s two - body scattering formula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 is spatial density of the protoplanet , which is given by inverse of volume of the planetesimal disk in the feeding zone , @xmath242 .",
