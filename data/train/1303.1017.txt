    "the current era is characterized by an enormous growth of stellar data of different nature . the advent of space missions , such as corot  ( co__nvection _ _ , ro__tation and planetary",
    "_ _ tr__ansits _ _ ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , designed to obtain precise photometry for an impressive number of stars , have led astronomers to undertake several ground - based spectroscopic campaigns in order to get as accurate as possible fundamental parameters such as effective temperature , surface gravity , projected rotational velocity , and metallicity .",
    "the analysis of this huge amount of data is possible , on reasonably short timescales , only through the use of automatic or semi - automatic procedures .    among the various targets observed by _",
    "kepler _ , am stars are assuming an ever growing importance .",
    "in fact , it was once thought that am stars did not pulsate , and that the explanation for this is that atomic diffusion is expected to drain helium from the heii driving zone .",
    "more intensive observations have revealed that this picture is not correct and several am stars are known to pulsate from ground - based observations ( based on superwasp photometry , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as from _ kepler _ satellite data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this last paper , the authors showed that an accurate measure of the location of the pulsating am stars in the hr diagram is crucial to pin down effectively the pulsation models and to put observational constraint on the instability strip for pulsation in am stars .",
    "however , for most of the investigated objects , a modern determination of the stellar parameters such as effective temperatures , gravities and chemical abundances , based on high resolution spectroscopy is still lacking . to fill this gap , we have already started a spectroscopic campaign devoted to obtain high resolution spectra of am stars , being the first data obtained with the spectrograph sarg installed at the italian telescope _",
    "tng_. our purpose in the near future is to analyze this growing amount of spectra to derive accurate stellar parameters for the investigated objects in the shortest possible time .",
    "there are several examples in the literature of papers regarding various methods for automatic ( or semi - automatic ) spectroscopic analysis , @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to ascertain the accuracy of the derived parameters obtained using different methods .",
    "a few recent papers have partially addressed this problem , reporting that significant differences can be found both in the derived stellar parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and/or in the estimated uncertainties in these quantities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the aim of understanding",
    "how accurately we can derive the stellar parameters and the hr location for our sample of am stars , we decided to concentrate our efforts on comparing the results that can be obtained by analyzing the high resolution spectrum for one star in our sample with the two methods available to us : i ) classical spectral synthesis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and ii ) versatile wavelength analysis ( _ vwa _ ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    to carry out this exercise , we choose to analyze in detail the am star hd71297",
    "this is the most suitable object in our sample because it is very bright ( v=5.58 mag ) and the sarg@tng spectrum has a very good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "moreover , hd71297 s brightness allowed us to find very useful observational data in the literature , including an accurate _ hipparcos _ parallax and interferometric measures which allow us to estimate independently from spectroscopy the stellar parameters .",
    "thus , the main goal of this paper is to ascertain if the two quoted methods of quantitative spectral analysis lead to different or , on the contrary , to comparable results when used to exploit exactly the same observational material .",
    "hd71297 has been classified as suspected marginal am star by @xcite , with a spectral type of a5 m : ( colon denoted its _ marginal _ nature ) .",
    "we remind readers the definition of marginal am star as an am star in which there is a difference of less than five subclasses between the k - line and the metal line spectral types , and in which the line strength anomalies are mild .",
    "@xcite concluded that the star exhibits only weak metallic lines , looking like the spectrum of @xmath1  ari .",
    "this classification has been confirmed one year later by @xcite .",
    "@xcite searched for binarity among a sample of 60 am stars and concluded that hd71297 may be variable in radial velocity with a period of a hundred days .",
    "they assigned the spectral type of ka8ha9mf0 to hd71297 .",
    "this star has also been studied by @xcite who derived atmospheric parameters , t@xmath2=7900  k , @xmath3=4.2 , and calcium abundance , @xmath4=6.33 , expressed in a scale in which @xmath5=12.0 , that is practically the solar value .",
    "later on , @xcite revisited the star , finding it a little bit cooler and less evolved , t@xmath2=7712  k and @xmath6=4.06 , but still with solar calcium abundance .",
    "no other studies have been found in the recent literature , especially no detailed analysis of the chemical pattern of its atmosphere .",
    "thus , we chose this object as a benchmark for the two methods of analysis we would like to compare in this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ abund ]",
    "in the previous section we have analyzed the high resolution spectrum of the am : star hd71297 using two different approaches : the classical spectral synthesis and _ vwa_. the results for effective temperature , gravity , @xmath7 , microturbulence , and chemical abundances , obtained with the two methods have been summarized in tab .",
    ". we can now compare between them the stellar parameters obtained with the two quoted methods , taking also into account the completely independent results obtained in sect .",
    "[ parallax ] for t@xmath2 and @xmath3 as summarized in tab .",

    "profiles computed with two convection models represented by red dashed line ( mlt ) and by blue dot - dashed line ( cm ) .",
    "_ bottom panel _ shows the differences between normalized fluxes in h@xmath1 profile obtained from two models differing only by the convection treatment.,width=340 ]    first of all , the atmospheric models we used in our calculations are both atlas9 based but with different convection zone treatments . in particular , in sect .",
    "[ spec_synt ] it was computed using the classical treatment mlt with fixed @xmath8=1.25 @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ vwa ] , the model was interpolated in the fine grid by @xcite , which uses a more advanced convection description based on @xcite ( cm ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of the different convection approaches into the balmer lines profiles and they concluded that the observed profiles should have an accuracy of at least 0.5@xmath9 to clearly appreciate the differences between convection models with different efficiency .    in order to quantify these effects on our target , we computed two synthetic h@xmath1 profiles using the same t@xmath2=7700  k and @xmath3=4.39 but with different convection models .",
    "we show this comparison in fig .",
    "[ comp_hb ] , where in the upper panel we compare the observed blue wing of the h@xmath1 with overimposed the profiles computed with mlt ( red dashed curve ) and with cm treatment ( blue dot - dashed line ) . in the bottom panel",
    "we report the difference in percentage between the two models .",
    "since the maximum difference is of the order of 1.5@xmath9 , indistinguishable at our level of signal - to - noise ratio , we conclude that for our target we can neglect the differences arising from the convection models adopted .    to verify the accuracy of this conclusion we have repeated the calculation for effective temperature , gravity , and abundances as described in sect .",
    "[ spec_synt ] .",
    "again , we estimated t@xmath2 by simultaneous fitting of h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 but using atlas9 models modified for the cm treatment convection .",
    "we obtained t@xmath2=7600@xmath12150  k , that is closer to the photometric / interferometric value , but also totally consistent with the value derived adopting the mlt treatment for convection . using this temperature , we estimated gravity fitting the mgi triplet and we obtain @xmath3=4.10@xmath120.10 , again compatible with previous value .    for what concerns the abundances , the model built with these values of effective",
    "temperature and gravity has been used to repeat the spectral synthesis analysis , adopting the same intervals as in sect .",
    "[ spec_synt ] . in fig .",
    "[ mltvscm ] we displayed the differences between the abundances reported in tab .",
    "[ abund ] computed with mlt based model and those computed with cm model .",
    "also in this case the results are consistent , being the weighted average of all differences equal to @xmath130.01@xmath120.09 .",
    "starting with t@xmath2 , the classical spectral synthesis method and _ vwa _ agree well within 1@xmath14 .",
    "there is also a 1.3@xmath14 agreement with the t@xmath2 value estimated from photometry and interferometry , albeit the _ vwa _ value is closer by 200 k to the reference value . on the contrary , concerning the value of @xmath3 , there is a significant discrepancy between the classical spectral synthesis method and _ vwa _ results : @xmath3=4.0@xmath120.1 dex from synthesis of the strong mgi triplet and @xmath3=4.39@xmath120.06 dex from ionization equilibrium of fei / feii ( _ vwa _ ) .",
    "the situation is even more complex if we take as a reference the gravity evaluated independently from spectroscopy in sect .",
    "[ phot ] : @xmath3=4.17@xmath120.05 dex .",
    "this value lies halfway between the two spectroscopy - based methods , being incompatible by more than 1 and 2@xmath14 with respect to the results of classical spectral synthesis and _ vwa _ methods , respectively .",
    "thus , if we trust in interferometry and parallax we have to conclude that even high resolution spectroscopy is unable , at least in the case hd71297 , of evaluating the @xmath3 value better than 0.2 dex , being also the internal errors on this value underestimated for both methods .",
    "to investigate further the accuracy of the results obtained with the two different spectroscopic analysis about t@xmath2 and @xmath6 , we built the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hd71297 ( see appendix for all the details on the construction of the sed ) as shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows the comparison of the various photometric or spectrophotometric sources with three models ( in different colors and line styles ) , as estimated in the previous sections=@xmath130.15 as derived for hd71297 ] . as well known , the balmer jump is sensitive to surface gravity ( as well as to effective temperature and line blanketing ) , hence looking at the uv part of the sed we can get some insight about the `` best '' couple ( t@xmath2 , @xmath3 ) . even a qualitative check on the figure show that the t@xmath2 , @xmath3 couple evaluated in sect .",
    "[ phot_sect ] ( from parallax and interferometry ) reproduces better the sed at all wavelength .",
    "in particular , in the far uv , the classical spectral synthesis method has the worse agreement due to the low t@xmath2 , whereas across the balmer jump , _ vwa _ seems to have a too high @xmath3 . this reflects the fact that both spectral synthesis and _ vwa _ methods go through a modeling that introduces errors , then it is important to discuss some of them .",
    "the error we found in @xmath3 by fitting the wings of the mgi triplet ( i.e. 0.1  dex ) is the formal error due to the fitting procedure .",
    "actually there is at least another source of error that we have to discuss and consider .",
    "the result of the modeling of a spectral line depends essentially on the atomic parameters of the transition and in particular , for what concern the width of the spectral lines , we have to pay attention to the radiative , stark and van der waals damping constants .",
    "the values of these three numbers set the broadening of the line and it is straightforward to understand the importance of their accuracy on the final value of @xmath3 .    to focus our attention on this problem , we performed the following simulation : we fitted the observed profile of the mgi @xmath155172.684  on synthetic profiles by varying the damping constants , one at a time , by an amount equal to their typical uncertainties . according to @xcite",
    ", we adopted 5@xmath9 as typical error in damping constants , obtaining that such a variation of @xmath16 and @xmath17 lead to an uncertainty in @xmath3 equal to @xmath180.3dex .",
    "similarly , a variation of @xmath19 of 5% , lead to a @xmath180.15dex uncertainty on @xmath3 . therefore , considering these errors as random and independent , we can conclude that the final uncertainties on gravity estimated by fitting the wings of one line is given from their quadratic sum and then equal to 0.45  dex .",
    "however , since we have applied this method to all the mgi triplet , the final uncertainty coming from atomic parameters is 0.26  dex .",
    "finally , considering also the formal error on the fitting procedure , we obtained the total error on @xmath3 equal to 0.28  dex .",
    "with such an error , @xmath3 derived with classical spectral synthesis is consistent with other values found in this study .",
    "as for _ vwa _ , the estimate of @xmath3 by means of the ionization balance can be affected by over - ionization effects and uncertainties in the temperature structure of the model atmosphere , as well as to uncertainties on the atomic parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , the formal error on @xmath3 we derived in our analysis has to be regarded as a lower limit for the true uncertainty on this parameter .",
    "since it is difficult to estimate quantitatively the effect of the various source of uncertainty on the final value of @xmath3 , we decided to assign a `` typical error '' of 0.2 dex .",
    "this suggestion is justified by the work of @xcite who used _ vwa _ to analyze high resolution spectra for 93 solar - type stars possessing accurate @xmath3 values measured by means of asteroseismological techniques on the basis of outstanding kepler satellite photometry .",
    "these authors find an average difference @xmath20=+0.08@xmath120.07 dex with a few objects showing larger discrepancies ( @xmath210.3 dex ) .",
    "thus , an uncertainty of the order of 0.2 dex in @xmath3 is absolutely normal .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite :  realistically , the typical errors on the atmospheric parameters of a star , will be t@xmath22100 k ( 1@xmath212% ) for @xmath120.2 dex ( @xmath2120% ) for @xmath3 \" .",
    "finally , as for the values of @xmath7 , @xmath23 , and chemical abundances , an inspection of tab .",
    "[ abund ] reveals that there is a good agreement between spectral synthesis and _ vwa _ , in spite of the discrepancies in t@xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the agreement in chemical abundance is not surprising . as argued by @xcite",
    ", the atmospheric parameters obtained from spectroscopic methods alone may not be consistent with the `` true '' values as obtained by model - independent methods , but this is not necessarily important for abundance analyses of stars .",
    "in this paper we have tested two different methods commonly used in the recent literature to characterize the stellar atmospheres and their chemical pattern : classical spectral synthesis and _ vwa _ package .",
    "this test was performed analyzing the spectrum of hd71297 carried out with sarg@tng .",
    "this object has been classified by @xcite as a suspected marginal metallic star , and later on @xcite assigned the spectral type of ka8ha9mf0 .    from direct measurements of distance and diameter , we obtained for our target the following astrophysical parameters : t@xmath2=7810@xmath1290k and @xmath3=4.17@xmath120.05 . as a by - product we were also able to derive estimation of r / r@xmath24=1.97@xmath120.14 , @xmath25=1.77@xmath26 , and age=790@xmath1290myrs .",
    "for what concern the main part of our paper , i.e. the comparison of the two different approaches , we can summarize as follows :    * classical spectral synthesis method gives us the following values : t@xmath2 = 7500 @xmath12 180 k and @xmath3 = 4.10 @xmath120.28 that are consistent with the previous values , at least within the errors . projected",
    "rotational velocity has been evaluated in 7.0@xmath120.5  km  s@xmath27 and @xmath23=2.4@xmath120.5  km  s@xmath27 . with these parameters ,",
    "abundance analysis gives us a general underabundance of iron peak elements with the exception of calcium that is solar in content .",
    "solar abundances are also shown by oxygen , yttrium , zirconium , barium and rare earths .",
    "we also tested the influence of the convection in the calculation of the synthetic spectrum .",
    "as in the case of vwa , we used @xcite models to repeat the analysis , obtaining results totally consistent with those obtained with mlt theory as treated in @xcite with no overshooting and @xmath8=1.25 . thus we conclude that , at least in the case of a star as hot as hd 71297 , and for the resolution and snr of our spectrum , the results are only slightly affected by the choice about the particular treatment of convection adopted for the analysis .",
    "the same conclusion is shared by @xcite , who conclude that the mlt and cm models all give similarly reasonable results . on the contrary , for cooler targets",
    "the role of convection will be more significant and we will take it into account properly .",
    "we obtained the following parameters : t@xmath2 = 7700 @xmath12 150 k and @xmath3 = 4.39 @xmath120.06 , a projected rotational velocity of 7.0@xmath121.0  km  s@xmath27 and @xmath23=2.4@xmath120.2  km  s@xmath27 . considering the experimental errors all these quantities are comparable with the ones derived with the others method .",
    "also the abundances show a pattern similar to the one computed with classical spectral synthesis .    as a general conclusion we can state that the methods considered in this study to derive fundamental parameters useful to characterize stellar atmosphere give consistent results , if we consider all the sources of experimental errors .",
    "an important result of this study concern the chemical pattern found for hd71297 .",
    "contrary to what is expected from the previous classification , our abundances ( reported in tab .",
    "[ abund ] ) do not look like those of normal am star ( see fig.5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "in fact , iron - peak elements show moderate underabundances , as well as carbon and sodium .",
    "heavy elements like yttrium , zirconium , barium and rare earths , that usually in a - type stars display abundances greater than the sun analogues @xcite , are quite normal in our target .",
    "the results shown in this paper , concernin the consistency of classical spectral synthesis and _ vwa _ approaches to the analysis of stellar spectra , will allow us to confidently apply these codes to the other am stars observed at sarg@tng .",
    "we thank the referee , m. s. bessell , for providing constructive comments that helped us in improving this paper .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the suspected marginal am star hd71297 . our goal is to test the accuracy of two different approaches to determine the atmospheric parameters effective temperature , gravity , projected rotational velocity , and chemical abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the methods used in this paper are : classical spectral synthesis and the _ versatile wavelength analysis _ ( _ vwa _ ) software .    </S>",
    "<S> since our star is bright and very close to the sun , we were able to determine its effective temperature and gravity directly through photometric , interferometric , and parallax measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the values found were taken as reference to which we compare the values derived by spectroscopic methods . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis leads us to conclude that the spectroscopic methods considered in this study to derive fundamental parameters give consistent results , if we consider all the sources of experimental errors , that have been discussed in the text . in addition , our study shows that the spectroscopic results are quite as accurate as those derived from direct measurements .    as for the specific object analyzed here , according to our analysis , hd71297 has chemical abundances not compatible with the previous spectral classification . </S>",
    "<S> we found moderate underabundances of carbon , sodium , magnesium , and iron - peak elements , while oxygen , aluminum , silicon , sulfur , and heavy elements ( z @xmath0 39 ) are solar in content . </S>",
    "<S> this chemical pattern has been confirmed by the calculations performed with both methods .    </S>",
