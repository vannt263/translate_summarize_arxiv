    "as detailed throughout these proceedings , gravitational lensing studies have yielded a wealth of information on galaxies . as technological advances in astronomy lead to the discovery of new populations of sources , the techniques of strong and weak gravitational lensing can be applied in order to study these source populations and their lenses .    the extraordinary resolution of the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) has allowed for the first time the detection of lenses where both the source and the deflector are `` normal '' optically - selected galaxies .",
    "ratnatunga et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discovered two such lenses .",
    "the southern hubble deep field ( hdf - s , williams et al .",
    "1999 ) is a more recent set of deep _ hst _ exposures .",
    "the best candidate lens , noted by the hdf - s team , consists of a blue arc about @xmath0 from an elliptical galaxy . in  2 we report on a detailed study of this arc .",
    "additional details can be found in barkana , blandford , & hogg ( 1999 ) .    despite the achievements of _ hst _ , detecting the earliest galaxies",
    "requires the superior infra - red sensitivity planned for the next generation space telescope ( _ ngst _ ; ferguson 1999 ) . in ",
    "3 we explore the ability of _ ngst _ to extend gravitational lensing studies well beyond their current limits ( see barkana & loeb 1999 for the complete details ) .",
    "lensing rates are expected to increase with source redshift .",
    "sources at @xmath3 will often be lensed by @xmath4 galaxies , whose masses can then be determined with lens modeling .",
    "in addition , the expected increase by 12 orders of magnitude in the number of extended sources on the sky , due to observations with _ ngst _",
    ", will dramatically improve upon the statistical significance of existing weak lensing measurements .",
    "figure 1 shows the candidate gravitational lens , hdfs  2232509603243 .",
    "the @xmath5  mag elliptical galaxy fits a de  vaucouleurs profile with an effective radius @xmath6 .",
    "comparison of the colors of the elliptical with hdf galaxies with known redshifts suggests that its redshift is roughly @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8  mag arc separates into four distinct components , labeled @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , going clockwise around the arc .",
    "we model components @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 as three images of a common source .",
    "we do not model component @xmath11 , which can be easily produced if the source is extended , or the dot , which we assume is a separate source .",
    "the image positions can be fit by simple lens models , i.e. , a singular isothermal halo with ellipticity or with shear .",
    "alternatively , a constant mass - to - light ratio model ( based on the resolved image of the lens galaxy ) also provides a fit when combined with a small external shear",
    ". however , with all the models a good fit is obtained only with a substantial shear produced by objects lying to the ne or sw .",
    "there are several galaxies @xmath13 to the sw and others @xmath14 to the ne , and these could contribute the required shear if spectroscopic redshifts confirm the presence of galaxy groups .    assuming the photometric lens redshift of @xmath15",
    "gives the lens a luminosity of @xmath16 .",
    "lens models imply a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath17 in solar units , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath18 .",
    "spectroscopy of this lens system should easily yield a lens redshift , and may yield a stellar velocity dispersion and an arc redshift .",
    "numerous galaxies and mini - quasars at redshifts @xmath19 will likely be imaged with _ ngst_. we apply semi - analytic hierarchical models of galaxy formation to estimate the rate of multiple imaging of these sources by intervening gravitational lenses .",
    "popular cdm models for galaxy formation yield a lensing optical depth of @xmath20 for sources at @xmath21 .",
    "the expected slope of the luminosity function of the early sources ( as estimated by haiman & loeb 1998 ) implies an additional magnification bias of @xmath22 , bringing the fraction of lensed sources at @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the estimated number of detected multiply - imaged sources per field of view of _ ngst _ is roughly 5 for @xmath3 quasars , 10 for @xmath25 quasars , 115 for @xmath3 galaxies , and 30200 for @xmath25 galaxies .",
    "these ranges in the numbers of galaxies arise from the uncertain efficiency with which cooled gas is converted to stars at high redshift .",
    "observations suggest that this efficiency @xmath26 lies between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "lensed sources may be difficult to detect if their images overlap the lensing galaxy , and if the lensing galaxy has a higher surface brightness . in order to compare the surface brightness of source galaxies to that of lens galaxies ,",
    "we calculate the redshift evolution of the mean surface brightness of galaxies detected by _ ngst _ , with results shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "although the surface brightness of a background source will typically be somewhat lower than that of the foreground lens , the lensed images should be detectable since they are offset from the lens center and their colors are expected to differ from those of the lens galaxy .",
    "these helpful features are evident in the case of the hdf - s lens of  2 .",
    "weak lensing requires that background sources be resolved .",
    "figure 2 ( right panel ) shows the distribution of galaxy sizes at various redshifts .",
    "although the typical size of sources decreases with increasing redshift , _ ngst _ should resolve at least @xmath29 of the @xmath3 galaxies that it will detect , and an even larger fraction of galaxies below redshift 10 .",
    "this implies that the shapes of these high redshift galaxies can be studied with _",
    "ngst _ , and thus the high resolution of _ ngst _ is crucial in making the majority of sources on the sky useful for weak lensing studies .",
    "the hdf - s was observed with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , which is operated by aura under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 . regarding the predictions for _ ngst _ , we are grateful to zoltan haiman for number count data , and to tal alexander and amiel sternberg for stellar population models .",
