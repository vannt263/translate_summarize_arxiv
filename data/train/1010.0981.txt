    "it is well known that galaxies are not randomly distributed in the universe , with high - density regions being observed as large - scale structures and low - density regions as voids . under the current @xmath3cdm cosmological paradigm , the evolution of these structures started in the early universe from primordial density fluctuations just after inflation , leading to the observed cosmic web . at very large scales , of tens of mpc , clusters , groups , and",
    "even pairs or isolated galaxies are disposed in very large associations , sometimes of filamentary or planar structure .",
    "these associations are the largest non - virialized structures in the universe : superclusters of galaxies .",
    "their dynamical future is still uncertain , but in a dark energy dominated universe most of them may evolve to _ island universes _ , single , isolated and highly concentrated mass clumps @xcite .",
    "the study of very large scale structures started with @xcite , who identified a high - density region in the galaxy distribution on the sky , nowadays known as the local supercluster .",
    "@xcite also helped to unveil large - scales through his catalogue of clusters of galaxies identified in the palomar observatory photographic plates ; he defined superclusters as clusters of clusters of galaxies .",
    "larger surveys were carried out and , as a consequence , the distribution of galaxies in the local universe could be studied in detail . the harvard center for astrophysics ( cfa ) survey measured the redshift of a sample of galaxies brighter than 14.5 @xcite , showing the filamentary distribution of galaxies , with galaxy clusters at the connection of the filaments .",
    "these redshifts allowed to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed , from the analysis of large - scale galaxy clustering in the iras survey , that a cosmological constant was required to explain the galaxy distribution in the framework of the cdm model .",
    "the data derived from redshift surveys later allowed to study the properties of individual superclusters , like pisces - cetus @xcite and shapley @xcite , as well as those of the whole population of superclusters , revealing that they tend to have an elongated morphology and extensions up to @xmath1100  h@xmath2  mpc @xcite .",
    "recent works reveal extensions up to 110 - 130h@xmath2mpc @xcite .",
    "the study of superclusters highly benefited from the _ 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey _ ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite and the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , more complete studies of large - scale structures were possible using these large redshift surveys .",
    "jaan einasto s group used the 2dfgrs data to generate a catalogue of superclusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter e07a ) .",
    "they also compared observed superclusters to simulated ones ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e07b ) and studied the spectral properties of galaxies within superclusters @xcite .",
    "their main results indicate that the overall properties of simulated and observed superclusters present good agreement with each other , but their luminosity and multiplicity ( number of galaxies ) distributions seem to be different .",
    "additionally , they found that galaxy morphology in superclusters depends on their richness , with rich superclusters presenting an early - type fraction slightly higher than poor superclusters . in another series of papers ( einasto et al .",
    "2007d , e ) , these authors have studied the richest superclusters identified in the observations . comparing the clumpiness of simulated and observed superclusters",
    ", they conclude that the clumpiness of galaxies in simulations is different from that observed @xcite , and that the global and local environments are quite important for galaxy morphology and star formation activity @xcite .    since superclusters are non - virialized structures , they present a variety of morphologies @xcite .",
    "several studies have used shape statistics @xcite and minkowski functionals @xcite to determine topological and geometrical properties useful for morphological analysis .",
    "the sdss and pscz ( saunders et al .",
    "2000 ) superclusters seem to have a prevalence of filamentary structures @xcite , as well as a concordance with the @xmath3cdm model of large - scale structure formation @xcite(hereafter b01 ) .",
    "a comparison of observed and simulated superclusters showed that simulated superclusters are very similar to those observed , but the number - density of very luminous superclusters seems to be higher in observations than in simulations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e06 ) .",
    "morphological studies suggest that galaxies are found in two distinct classes of structures at very large scales : filaments and pancakes . using the shapefinder technique @xcite",
    ", b01 applied this approach to distinguish between these two classes using the so called shape - spectrum .",
    "further works used filament features to constrain the galaxy clustering , since the bias parameter is also sensitive to filamentarity @xcite .",
    "using galaxy luminosities and colours , @xcite found a dependence between galaxy properties and filamentarity , proposing a scenario where elliptical galaxies are predominantly in dense regions , while spiral galaxies are distributed along filaments .",
    "a strong spatial alignment between clusters and host superclusters in large filaments was found in n - body simulations @xcite .    here",
    "we present a study of supercluster morphologies through the study of the galaxy distribution in volume - limited samples extracted from sdss data release  7 @xcite .",
    "we use a kernel - based density field method to identify the superclusters and minkowski functionals to quantify their shape .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ data ] presents the data used here as well as our method to deal with selection effects . in section  [ densityfield ]",
    "we describe the kernel - based density field method used to identify superclusters as well as the criteria to classify enhanced regions as superclusters taking into account the selection and boundary effects . in section  [ morphclass ] the morphological classification",
    "is described and in section  [ resultsanddiscussion ] we discuss the morphology of observed and simulated superclusters .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we summarize the main conclusions of this paper . in appendix [ apend_a ]",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of our supercluster identification and morphological analysis to the adopted kernel .    when necessary , distances were calculated assuming the following cosmology : @xmath4 , @xmath5 and hubble parameter @xmath6=100  h@xmath7  km  s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is based on a volume - limited galaxy sample extracted from the sloan digital sky survey data release seven ( sdss - dr7 ) @xcite .",
    "we have considered galaxies with measured radial velocities and with absolute magnitudes in the @xmath8 band brighter than @xmath9 in the redshift range @xmath10 .",
    "absolute magnitudes were calculated with k - corrections obtained with the code @xmath11 @xmath12 and with a specific sdss package provided by . since superclusters may extend over several degrees on the sky , we have considered only galaxies within stripes 10 to 37 to assure a large continuous area on the sky .",
    "the total number of galaxies selected is 120,013 .",
    "in section 5 we shall compare some of our results with numerical simulations .",
    "for this we have used simulated light - cones produced by @xcite , based on a semi - analytic galaxy evolution model applied to the output of the millenium simulation @xcite .",
    "we have selected the four light - cones with parameters suited for sdss : sdss_sacone_012_000 , sdss_sacone_012_100 , sdss_sacone_120_000 , and sdss_sacone_201_000 .",
    "each covers an area of 60 @xmath13 30 deg@xmath14 and the simulated galaxies were selected following the same criteria adopted in the selection of our volume - limited sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "the number of simulated galaxies selected in the four light - cones is 99,850 .",
    "superclusters are sometimes defined as large - scale overdensity regions in the galaxy distribution @xcite . adopting this definition ,",
    "the density field method represents a convenient way to identify these structures ( e.g. , e07a , b01 ) . in this section",
    "we describe how we define the density field of a sample of galaxies .",
    "firstly , using the equatorial coordinates @xmath15 and the redshift @xmath16 of each galaxy , we calculated its cartesian coordinates as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is comoving distance of the galaxy .",
    "the luminosity density of the galaxy distribution , @xmath19 , is calculated through the kernel approach . at a certain point",
    "@xmath20 in space it is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the kernel used to smooth the galaxy distribution , @xmath23 is the luminosity of the @xmath24-th galaxy ( at position @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 is a weight which takes into account selection effects ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "we adopt here epanechnikov s kernel , which minimizes the asymptotic mean integrated squared error ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is defined as @xmath27\\ \\ \\ \\",
    "r\\leq\\sigma\\\\   0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ r>\\sigma\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{kernel2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the smoothing parameter . we have adopted @xmath28=8  h@xmath2mpc .",
    "the reason is that the number density of galaxies in our sample ( see next section ) is @xmath29(h@xmath2mpc)@xmath30 , corresponding to a mean distance between galaxies of @xmath18  h@xmath2mpc .",
    "as shown later , this choice leads to a density field relatively insensitive to peculiar velocities .",
    "the density field is sampled in a 3d grid with cells of side @xmath31=4  h@xmath2mpc .    to identify structures in the density field ,",
    "it is necessary to define a density threshold to separate high - density regions ( e.g. , superclusters ) from low - density regions ( e.g. , voids ) . in this way",
    ", we have rejected all grid points below the threshold .",
    "afterwards , a friends - of - friends algorithm was used to connect nearby high - density grid points , assigning them to single objects .",
    "the linking - length used is equal to the diagonal of the cell grid , i.e. , @xmath327  h@xmath2mpc .",
    "only objects with more than 10 galaxies and volume larger than two grid cells , @xmath33=@xmath34=128(h@xmath2mpc)@xmath35 , will be considered in the analysis .",
    "note that about 0.3% of the dr7 imaging footprint area are marked as holes . in these regions",
    "we have used bilinear interpolation to obtain the density field , considering only grid points at a given redshift more distant that 8 h@xmath2mpc from the hole borders .",
    "since the area occupied by the holes is small , and most of the holes are in low - density regions , it can be verified that this procedure has a negligible impact on our results .",
    "there is no natural value for the threshold density . in figure  [ nscxdens ]",
    "we present the number of structures ( hereafter called superclusters ) as a function of the threshold in units of mean density ( @xmath36 ) , computed with the selection function discussed in * 3.2*. for low threshold density values , percolation links distinct structures and consequently the number of superclusters is low . at high threshold values ,",
    "only high density objects are identified , also resulting in a low number of structures . in this work",
    "we have adopted two distinct values for the threshold density .",
    "the first one , @xmath37 ( hereafter d1 ) , is the value which maximizes the number of superclusters .",
    "the second one , @xmath38 ( hereafter d2 ) , was chosen such as the largest superclusters present an extension of @xmath1120  h@xmath2mpc , as adopted by .",
    "this length consists of the diagonal of the box which contains all galaxies of the supercluster , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "two important features of superclusters can be defined here : their richness and total luminosity .",
    "the richness can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the number of galaxies of the supercluster and @xmath42 is the selection effect correction of the @xmath24-th galaxy .",
    "the total supercluster luminosity- actually the expected luminosity above the magnitude limit- is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath23 represents the luminosity of the @xmath24-th galaxy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our results are not too sensitive to the choice of the smoothing kernel .",
    "we present in appendix [ apend_a ] a summary of results obtained with a truncated gaussian kernel , showing that our estimates of supercluster parameters are indeed very robust .",
    "the selection function aims at correcting for galaxies brighter than our magnitude limit that , for a reason or another , were not included in the sample .",
    "indeed , our magnitude limited sample is affected by incompleteness due to fiber collisions in the spectroscopic survey .",
    "consequently , although the nominal magnitude limit of the sdss main galaxy sample mgs ) is @xmath44 , not all galaxies brighter than this limit were observed . there is a minimum distance between fiber allocations by the sdss spectrographs of about 55 arcsec @xcite and some galaxies within the mgs photometric limits do not have spectroscopy because they are closer than 55 arcsec to a galaxy to which a fiber was allocated .",
    "this spectroscopic incompleteness depends on the apparent magnitude since fainter galaxies are more affected .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ completeness ] , which presents the fraction of galaxies with spectroscopy as a function of the apparent magnitude @xmath45 .",
    "the spectroscopic incompleteness leads to a radial selection effect , since galaxies with higher apparent magnitude tend to be at higher redshifts . since in this case the shot - noise increases with distance",
    ", the coupling between this radial effect and a constant smoothing parameter introduces an additional distortion in the density field @xcite .",
    "this bias leads to an overestimation of the density with increasing redshift ( b01 ) .    to deal with these effects , we have adopted a simple model for the selection function , with two components .",
    "the first one depends on the apparent magnitude ( @xmath46 ) and the second one on the redshift , or comoving distance ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the selection function is thus defined as @xmath48 and is related to the weight @xmath49 as @xmath50    the apparent magnitude component can be defined as @xmath51 and we model the trend seen in figure  [ completeness ] with a fourth order polynomial : @xmath52    .",
    "the red line represents the fourth order polynomial fitted to the observed trend . ]    to estimate the radial component of the selection function we , initially , calculated the mean of the density field grid points in ten regions with same volume , taking into account only the apparent magnitude incompleteness ( i.e. , assuming @xmath53 ) . as shown in figure [ shot - noise ] , the mean density of each region increases with redshift , reflecting the bias mentioned above .",
    "however , a comparison with figure 3 of b01 indicates that the effect here , is significantly less severe in our volume limited sample than in magnitude limited samples . to correct for this effect",
    ", we model the dependence of the mean density with comoving distance as @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 for distances in mpc . taking @xmath47 into account , the radial trend in the mean value of the density field",
    "disappears , as shown in figure [ shot - noise ] .          due to the large sizes of superclusters and to the limited volume of our galaxy sample , care should be taken to avoid boundary effects that can affect the analysis described in the next sections .    with this aim",
    ", we considered only structures where all galaxies have comoving transversal distances from any volume boundary border larger than @xmath57 8  h@xmath2mpc .",
    "figure  [ radec - boundary ] shows the region occupied by our initial sample ( in black ) as well as its boundary points ( in green ) .",
    "superclusters in the region with @xmath58 and @xmath59 were excluded from our sample to avoid boundary effects . excluding superclusters at the boundary , our final supercluster sample has 880 structures above the threshold d1 and 409 structures above d2 .",
    "their main properties are shown in table  1 .",
    "since superclusters of galaxies are not virialized structures , they present a large variety of shapes . in this section",
    "we present the shapefinder method which we adopted to describe the morphology of these structures .",
    "first we discuss the ellipsoidal model to describe the structures and then we use minkowski functionals to obtain a morphological parameter .",
    "a simple description of the tri - dimensional morphology of a body can be obtained through its best - fit tri - axial ellipsoid .",
    "this model has 8 free parameters : three for the centroid of the structure , two for its orientation and three for the semi - axes @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the parameters of the ellipsoid can be inferred from the inertia tensor , i.e. , the matrix of second - order moments of particle positions , @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents de @xmath24-th coordinate of the @xmath65 galaxy with respect to the object centroid .",

    "we follow here the formalism of @xcite , which uses ellipsoidal models for the morphological description of the objects .    having as input parameters the semi - axes @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 obtained in the previous section",
    ", we can determine , for an object or isodensity contour , four parameters : the volume ( v ) , the surface ( s ) , the integrated mean curvature ( c ) and the integrated gaussian curvature ( @xmath69 ) , also called _",

    "we ran a large number ( 200 ) of monte carlo simulations where we randomized the equatorial coordinates of the galaxies , keeping their comoving distances and the sample boundaries in order to preserve the selection function .",
    "since this randomization destroys the sdss clustering , the structures identified in each simulation will be due to statistical noise .",
    "the probability of identifying real superclusters in our sample through this procedure is then @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the number of structures identified in the randomized samples and @xmath134 is the number of structures identified in our original sdss sample .",
    "a probability close to 1 means that the number of spurious objects produced by our supercluster identification method is small .",
    "this analysis was performed for the same threshold densities as in section [ kernel ] .",
    "figure [ hist - random ] shows the resulting probability distribution obtained with the threshold d1 , presenting a median probability @xmath135 around 85% . for the threshold d2 ,",
    "the median probability is higher than 99.8% .",
    "figure  [ hist - ltot - rand ] compares the luminosity distribution of our d1 sdss superclusters with that obtained from the simulations .",
    "the result clearly indicates that most random structures have luminosities significantly lower than those of the sdss superclusters .",
    "this result is also noticed by comparing the median values of the sdss and random luminosity distributions .            the same morphological analysis as described in section [ morphclass ]",
    "was applied to the structures identified in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "no trends were found between the total luminosity or richness and the morphological parameter @xmath117 , indicating that the results displayed in figure [ morphology - k1k2-sdss ] are indeed real and not produced by random fluctuations or by the selection function of the sample .",
    "another test of robustness of the main trends identified in this work can be done by considering only structures with total luminosities larger than @xmath136 , since our monte carlo simulations indicate that the expected number of spurious structures in this case is only @xmath13.7% .",
    "all our previous results are confirmed .",
    "we have selected a volume - limited sample of galaxies from the sdss in order to identify galaxy superclusters , determine their morphologies and investigate some of their features .",
    "our sdss sample contains galaxies with @xmath137 in the redshift range @xmath138 and covers stripes 10 to 37 .",
    "we have also analyzed simulated light - cones based on a semi - analytic galaxy evolution model applied to the output of the millenium simulation @xcite , to confront theory and observations and to examine the role of some systematic effects .",
    "superclusters were identified by the density field method with an epanechnikov kernel , taking into account selection and boundary effects . by comparing the results obtained with this kernel with those obtained with a truncated gaussian kernel ,",
    "we show that the results are not strongly dependent on the kernel choice .",
    "the kernel smoothing parameter and the dimension of the density field cell were chosen as @xmath28=8  h@xmath2mpc and @xmath139=4  h@xmath2mpc .",
    "two threshold densities were chosen to evaluate their influence on supercluster identification and morphology .",
    "the first maximizes the number of structures ( d1 ) and the second is chosen by limiting the size of the largest superclusters to @xmath1120  h@xmath2mpc ( d2 ) .",
    "we found that , at least qualitatively , our results do not depend on the density threshold used .",
    "each supercluster is characterized by its richness and total luminosity , as well as by a morphological parameter determined through minkowski functionals , which allows their classification as filaments or pancakes .",
    "following e07b , we have found significant correlations of the morphological parameter @xmath117 with richness and total luminosity in both the observed and mock supercluster catalogues , indicating that filaments tend to be richer and consequently more luminous than pancakes .    to evaluate the influence of peculiar velocities on supercluster morphology ,",
    "we have used mock catalogues to examine structures identified in the velocity and position spaces .",
    "we conclude that peculiar velocities do not play a significant role in our results , probably due to the large kernel smoothing length adopted in this work .",
    "we have found a trend between supercluster total luminosity ( or richness ) and morphology , with filaments being in the mean more luminous than pancakes .",
    "a similar behaviour was found by analyzing mock catalogues .",
    "the analysis of monte carlo simulations of randomized galaxy distributions indicates that these trends are real and are not produced by random fluctuations or selection effects .    finally , we compared the luminosity and size distributions of filaments and pancakes .",
    "we have found that they are significantly different , with filaments presenting a broader distribution of sizes and luminosities .",
    "again , similar results were obtained by the analysis of the mock catalogues , showing that filaments and pancakes represent distinct morphological classes of superclusters in the universe .",
    "also , since filaments tend to be richer , more luminous and larger than pancakes , it is plausible to think that pancakes evolve towards filaments .",
