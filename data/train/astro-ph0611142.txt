    "relativistic jets are observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galactic black hole candidates .",
    "the velocity of these jets is highly relativistic with a bulk lorentz factor above 10 and the kinetic power is almost comparable to the eddington luminosity",
    ". the production and bulk acceleration mechanisms of these jets are still unknown , though many ideas have been proposed ranging from magneto - hydrodynamical to radiative ones .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the matter content of jets from observations , several independent arguments favor electron - positron jets @xcite .",
    "electron - positron jets are most likely produced in accretion disks around the central black holes . because the electron mass is much smaller than the proton mass ,",
    "the produced electron - positron pairs can be more easily ejected than protons .",
    "some papers discuss the accretion disks with electron - positron outflows @xcite .",
    "if the accretion disks form hot pair plasma strongly coupled with photons , the plasma may be thermally accelerated like the fireball applied to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "as long as the initial conditions for the fireball model are satisfied , the flow accelerates to a relativistic velocity undoubtedly @xcite .",
    "however , the characteristic size of agns is too large to form fireballs which are in a complete thermal equilibrium at high temperatures comparable to the electron rest mass energy @xmath2 . in the standard fireball model , to make matters worse , electron - positron pairs are almost wholly annihilated in the course of the thermal expansion .    to overcome this situation",
    ", @xcite showed that a `` wien fireball '' , which is optically thick to compton scattering but thin to absorption , results in a relativistic outflow avoiding the difficulties of pair annihilation .",
    "when high - energy photons are provided sufficiently , copious electron - positron pairs are produced . from the size and luminosity of agns ,",
    "the pair plasma is not expected to be in a complete thermal equilibrium .",
    "the pair plasma may be optically thin to absorption but thick to scattering .",
    "since photons and pairs are coupled by lepton scattering , the plasma can be thermally accelerated expending its internal energy . in this case",
    ", as long as the temperature remains relativistic ( @xmath3 ) , sufficient pair creation by high - energy photons compensates for pair annihilation . since the cross section of pair annihilation and that of compton scattering are the same order , the number of pairs is almost conserved outside the photosphere , where photons and pairs are decoupled .",
    "therefore , if the temperature at the photosphere is relativistic , a sufficient amount of electron - positron pairs survive as a relativistic outflow .",
    "although super - eddington luminosity in spherical symmetry is needed in the wien fireball model , the real luminosity for collimated jets can be sub - eddington .",
    "pairs are formed via photon photon collisions in the accretion disk composed of normal plasma ( electron - proton ) . assuming that pairs are confined with protons , several authors @xcite investigated pair equilibrium plasmas . as is typically shown in @xcite ,",
    "the plasma temperature becomes @xmath4 for plasmas of size @xmath5 cm and luminosity @xmath6 @xmath7 , because of the high cooling rate of dense pairs . on the other hand",
    ", the wien fireball model requires a super eddington luminosity @xmath8 erg @xmath1 in the spherical symmetry and a high temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the series of studies of pair equilibrium plasmas imply that the equilibrium temperature is too low for the wien fireball model .",
    "however , considering the effects of pair escape from the disk by their own pressure or radiative force @xcite , there is a possibility that the density and temperature of pairs are drastically different from the values obtained assuming static plasmas . in order to prove pair ejection from the disk ,",
    "one may need to treat multi - plasma dynamics with radiation field .",
    "however , there has been no study of formation and ejection of pairs from the accretion disk taking into account radiative transfer consistently .    in this paper",
    "we simulate outflows of electron - positron pairs from hot plasmas with radiative transfer in order to discuss whether or not agns can produce fireballs with sufficiently high temperatures . for simplicity ,",
    "the multi - fluid approximation is adopted , and the plasma is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the microscopic physical processes we take into account are coulomb scattering , compton scattering , bremsstrahlung , electron - positron pair annihilation and creation in electron , positron , and proton plasmas . in ",
    "2 we explain our method , and the numerical results are shown in  3 .",
    " 4 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this paper we numerically obtain spherically symmetric , steady solutions of radiation and pair outflows from hot plasmas undergoing steady external heating .",
    "first of all we consider a static plasma consisting of protons ( _ p _ ) and electrons ( _ e _ ) . the proton number density is assumed to be @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radius from the center .",
    "the total heating rate of the plasma is given as a parameter @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the heating rate is proportional to @xmath13 , the proton heating rate per unit volume is obtained as @xmath14 inside this plasma electron - positron pairs ( _ e@xmath15 _ ) are produced via photon photon collisions . in this calculation we assume the plasmas are divided into three fluids : proton ( _ p _ ) , background electron ( _ e _ ) , and pair ( _ e@xmath15 _ ) fluids .",
    "the background electrons are confined with protons to maintain charge neutrality .",
    "thus , the number density of the _ e_-fluid , @xmath16 , is the same as that of the _ p_-fluid , @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", positrons may move independently of the _ p_-fluid . in order to maintain charge neutrality positrons of the density @xmath17 in the comoving frame accompany electrons of the same density @xmath18 .",
    "namely , electrons are artificially divided into two components ; one belongs to the _ e_-fluid , and another belongs to the pair - fluid . even if the pair - fluid flows with velocity @xmath19 , _ p _ and",
    "_ e_-fluids are assumed to be static .",
    "although the validity of this multi - fluid approximation is not always assured , we adopt this approximation for simplicity .    the conservation laws of energy , momentum , and number of electron - positron pairs in the rest frame of _",

    "normalizing @xmath31 by the electron mass as @xmath32 , the energy density in the rest frame , @xmath25 , is written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the @xmath35th order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the source terms @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , which are measured in the coordinate frame , are explained in the following subsections .",

    "therefore , we neglect the effect of finite @xmath45 on @xmath40 and @xmath41 in our case .    the heating rate of pair - fluid through photons",
    "@xmath42 is divided into two parts as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the cooling rate due to photon production ( bremsstrahlung and pair annihilation ) , and @xmath57 is the heating rate by circumambient photons via compton scattering and pair - creation . in this paper",
    "we only consider thermal bremsstrahlung and pair - annihilation for photon - production processes .",
    "we use the formulae of the cooling rates in @xcite for bremsstrahlung ( _ ep _ , _ ee _ , and _ e@xmath58e@xmath59 _ ) and pair annihilation .",
    "the radiative cooling rates due to scattering of two particles in the background fluids ( _ ep _ and _ ee_-bremsstrahlung ) are easily obtained .",

    "on the other hand , bremsstrahlung emission and pair annihilation of two particles in the pair - fluid ( pair - fluid emissions ) are calculated in the comoving frame @xmath27 .",
    "the lorentz transformation implies that the cooling rates due to bremsstrahlung , @xmath64 , and @xmath65=@xmath66 , and the rate due to pair annihilation , @xmath67 in the coordinate frame @xmath20 are @xmath68 times those in the frame @xmath27 .",
    "we should notice that there are emission processes between two particles of different fluids ; one belongs to the pair - fluid and another belongs to the background fluids .",
    "we call such emissions `` inter - fluid emissions '' . since the pair - fluid is moving velocity , inter - fluid emissions are not isotropic in any frame . in our simulation",
    "we adopt the following approximation for the cooling rates due to inter - fluid emissions . in the frame @xmath69 , which moves with velocity @xmath70 , the two fluids flow symmetrically ; the background fluids flow with velocity @xmath71 , while the pair - fluid flows towards the opposite direction with the same speed @xmath71 . in this frame",
    "the densities of the _ e_-fluid and pair - fluid are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , where @xmath74 .",
    "we use the usual formulae for thermal and isotropic plasma adopting the temperature as @xmath75 and densities @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 for bremsstrahlung , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and pair annihilation , @xmath81 , or @xmath82 for bremsstrahlungs , @xmath83 .",
    "the superscript `` int '' means inter - fluid emissions .",
    "the cooling rates in the frame @xmath20 become @xmath84 times those in the frame @xmath69 .",
    "we assume that two fluids lose energies equally via these emissions , except for @xmath85 and @xmath86 processes , in which only the pair - fluid loses energy .",
    "the above approximation may seem rough .",
    "however , as will be shown in our results , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are plausible for energetic jets .",
    "therefore , inter - fluid emissions have minor effects on the motion of the pair - fluid .    from the above assumptions we obtain @xmath89 the heating rate @xmath57 by circumambient photons via pair creation and compton scattering is obtained from calculation of radiative transfer , which is explained in the next subsection .",
    "the heating rate of background electrons , @xmath90 , by protons is also obtained from ( [ hp ] ) replacing @xmath31 and @xmath91 by @xmath47 and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "our numerical method is basically the same as @xcite .",
    "we shortly explain the method in this subsection .",
    "we divide the calculation regime into many spherical shell elements . from each shell",
    ", photons are emitted via background , pair , and inter - fluid emissions , which are assumed to be isotropic in the frames , @xmath20 , @xmath27 , and @xmath69 , respectively .",

    "this approximation well reproduces the specral shapes of bremsstrahlung numerically obtained , based on the methods of quantum electrodynamics @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we adopt a fitting formula of @xcite for pair - annihilation spectrum .",
    "the pair - fluid emission and the inter - fluid emission are assumed to be isotropic in the frames @xmath27 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "we define the emission coefficient , @xmath98 [ @xmath99 @xmath7 @xmath100 : emitted energy per unit time per unit volume per unit solid angle and per unit photon - energy , where @xmath101 is the cosine between the direction of the photon and the radial direction . taking the inter - fluid emissions as an example , the emission coefficient in the frame @xmath20 is obtained from the lorentz invariant @xmath102 @xcite and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the photon - energy in the frame @xmath69 . for the pair - fluid emissions",
    "too , we obtain the emission coefficients in the same way .",
    "generating photons according to the above method , we simulate the trajectory of each photon propagating through the three fluids and photon field , where the photon interacts with electrons , positrons , and photons themselves .",
    "elementary processes to be considered are compton scattering and pair creation .",
    "we use the klein - nishina formula and the representation in @xcite for the cross sections of compton scattering and pair creation , respectively .",
    "we simulate all these processes by the monte carlo method .",
    "details of the method of following the photon trajectory is given in @xcite .",
    "after simulating all photons emitted from all shells toward all directions , we numerically obtain the photon distribution in the phase space , the heating rates @xmath57 and @xmath93 , the radiative force on the pair - fluid @xmath105 , and the pair creation rate @xmath106 .",
    "however , results depend on the photon distribution assumed in advance .",
    "therefore , given the parameters of the three fluids , we simulate iteratively until the photon distribution converges .",
    "the momentum source @xmath37 is expressed as @xmath107 , where @xmath105 is the radiative force due to pair creation and compton scattering , @xmath108 is the reaction force due to photon - emission , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the frictional forces due to coulomb scattering with background electrons and protons , respectively . as was mentioned in the former subsection , @xmath105 is obtained from the calculation of radiative transfer .    @xcite calculated @xmath109 and @xmath110 numerically for two maxwell - boltzmann gasses with relative velocities @xmath43-@xmath44 using relativistic formulae , and they express their results as a form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the density of pairs in the frame @xmath20 .",
    "the functions @xmath113 are listed as tables in @xcite . for @xmath114 ,",
    "@xmath113 increases with @xmath45 monotonically . beyond @xmath115 ,",
    "@xmath116 decreases with @xmath45 , while @xmath117 is nearly constant .",
    "the lower temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath118 become , the larger the frictional forces become .",
    "although photons are emitted isotropically in the frame @xmath27 , the photons are beamed in the frame @xmath20 and the pair - fluid loses momentum .",
    "the lorentz transformation implies @xmath119 where we neglect the contribution of the inter - fluid emission . in the strict sense the inter - fluid emission causes momentum transfer between the pair - fluid and the background fluids . in order to obtain the momentum transfer in bremsstrahlung , the scattering processes of two particles with photon emission , we need messy and heavy calculations using the differential cross sections as functions of both the particle scattering angle and the photon angle . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum transfers due to pair - annihilation are numerically calculated in @xcite , which shows that the rate due to pair - annihilation is negligible in comparison with that due to coulomb scattering .",
    "the momentum transfers due to processes accompanying photon emission , including bremsstrahlung , may be negligible .",
    "the smallness of momentum transfer and the difficulties in calculations are reasons why we have neglected the contribution of the inter - fluid emission in equation ( [ frad ] ) .",
    "of course , the background fluids are also pushed outward by photons and the frictional force . in this paper , we assume that the background fluids are maintained to be static ; such forces are balanced with the gravitational force by the central black hole , which is implicit in our geometry of computation .",
    "e_-fluid suffers from the counteractive frictional force @xmath109 and the radiative force , which can be stronger than the total force on the _ p_-fluid .",
    "there should be a certain degree of charge separation between the _ e_-fluid and _ p_-fluid to maintain the _ e_-fluid static .",
    "the resultant static electric field may affect the motion of the pair - fluid .",
    "electrons in the pair - fluid are decelerated , while positrons are accelerated .",
    "the force due to the static electric field on the pair - fluid becomes zero on the average .",
    "as long as we adopt the multi - fluid approximation , we can neglect the effect of the static electric field , although there is possibility that the kinematical effects of the electric field heat the pair - fluid .",
    "the source term @xmath38 , which is lorentz invariant , is expressed as @xmath120 , where @xmath106 and @xmath121 are the pair creation and annihilation rates , respectively .",
    "while @xmath106 is obtained from the calculation of radiative transfer , we adopt a formula in @xcite for @xmath121 .",
    "as is the case of radiative cooling , the positron annihilation rate is divided into two parts as @xmath122 .",
    "the method of calculation of @xmath123 is the same way as the inter - fluid cooling , in which @xmath124 , @xmath77 , and @xmath97 are used . even if a positron annihilates with an electron in the _",
    "e_-fluid , the number density of _",
    "e_-fluid should be invariant to maintain the multi - fluid approximation .",
    "therefore , we should consider that an electron in the pair - fluid is traded to the _ e_-fluid in this case . as a result",
    "two particles in the pair fluid disappear in each inter - fluid annihilation .",
    "the trade of electrons means that energy and momentum are also transferred between the two fluids .",
    "however , as we have mentioned several times , such energy and momentum transfer may be negligible in this case too .",
    "although this unavoidable treatment in the inter - fluid annihilation indicates a limit in the multi - fluid approximation , we adopt this approximation to save cost in computation .",
    "we solve @xmath91 , @xmath68 , @xmath31 , @xmath47 , and @xmath46 from equations ( [ h])-([q]),([h0 ] ) , and ( [ he ] ) . first of all we set plausible values for the three fluids . then , combined with radiative transfer to obtain the source terms , we mimic the time evolution of the plasmas .",
    "since the photon diffusion time scale is much longer than the dynamical time scale , we can not follow the time evolution of both the plasmas and photon field consistently .",
    "however , the final steady solutions are consistently obtained by mimicking the time evolution for a sufficiently long time .",
    "in our numerical simulation , the energy space of photons @xmath125 is divided into 70 bins in the logarithmic manner between @xmath126 and @xmath44 . for the direction of photons , @xmath101 is divided into 20 bins between @xmath127 and 1 .",
    "the outer boundary is set at @xmath128 , and the radial coordinate is divided into 40 shells .",
    "we follow more than @xmath129 paths of photons to solve radiative transfer . some figures in this section",
    "are plotted using results after following @xmath130 paths of photons .",
    "we do not take into account photons from outside of the boundary",
    ". however , such photons may not affect the outflow as will be shown later .    in this calculation",
    "the parameters are the radius @xmath131 , density @xmath132 and luminosity @xmath12 . for several values of @xmath12 above @xmath133 erg @xmath1",
    ", we simulate plasmas for two sets of parameters : @xmath134 cm with @xmath135 @xmath136 , and @xmath137 cm with @xmath138 @xmath136 .",
    "these values are characteristic of accretion plasmas in agns . in both cases , the pair free thomson scattering depth @xmath139 .    when @xmath12 is less than @xmath140 erg @xmath1 , the results are almost the same as those in @xcite . as the luminosity @xmath12 increases , the temperature of pairs decreases , while the pair density increases",
    "the positron density is comparable to the proton density .",
    "however , a depression of the pair density in the central region , which is seen in @xcite for @xmath141 erg @xmath1 , is not observed in our simulation .",
    "the pair density decreases with radius @xmath11 monotonically .",
    "the pair fluid escapes from the boundary by their own pressure .",
    "the radiative force is not effective to drive the outflow in these cases .",
    "however , the energy fraction of the outflow is negligible compared with the total luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "the almost all energy injected in the plasmas escape as photon energy .",
    "outside the boundary , most of these photons may escape without interaction with the pair - fluid .",
    "therefore , the pair - fluid does not behave as a fireball in these cases , which is out of our interest .    as the luminosity @xmath12 increases above @xmath142 erg @xmath1 , the pair density overwhelms the proton density .",
    "although the pair temperature @xmath143 continues to decrease with growth of @xmath12 , @xmath143 is always larger than @xmath144 . for @xmath145 erg @xmath1 , a considerable amount of energy escapes in the form of the pair - fluid . in this high - luminosity case ,",
    "the outflow is driven by radiative force rather than their own pressure .    in this paper",
    "we show detailed results for @xmath146 erg @xmath1 , @xmath137 cm , and @xmath138 @xmath136 as a representative case .",
    "the positron density @xmath17 and 4-velocity @xmath45 are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the ratio of number densities of positrons and protons @xmath147 is 74 and 440 at the center and the boundary @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath45 monotonically increases with @xmath11 , and becomes 1.01 at the boundary .",
    "the mean free path for the thomson scattering at the boundary is @xmath149 cm , which is much shorter than @xmath150 cm .",
    "therefore , even outside the boundary , the outflow and photons are tightly coupled and behave as a fireball . in other words ,",
    "our simulation is confined well inside the photosphere , which raises some problem with the treatment of the radiative transfer . however , as is seen later , since the photons are beamed in the outer region , the problem may not be so severe .",
    "the outflow may continue to be accelerated outside @xmath151 . as conventionally used in the grb standard model",
    ", we define the ratio of the total luminosity to the mass ejection rate as @xmath152 in the grb models this value , which corresponds to the final lorentz factor of the outflow , is defined using the baryon ejection rate . in our case too , if the number of pairs is practically conserved within the photospheric radius , the final lorentz factor of the flow is on the same order of @xmath153 , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "our simulation shows @xmath154 , which is enough to explain the high lorentz factor of agn jets .",
    "however , in order to conserve the number of pairs , a relativistic photon temperature at the photosphere is required .",
    "the temperatures @xmath143 and @xmath155 are plotted in figure 2 . at the center",
    "the pair temperature @xmath143 is 0.13 .",
    "the temperature @xmath143 increases with @xmath11 slightly , and becomes 0.19 at the boundary , which is smaller than the temperature assumed in the wien fireball model @xcite . in this case , because of pair - annihilation , the number of pairs may decrease seriously before pairs and photons decouple .",
    "the temperature @xmath156 is almost the same as @xmath143 so that we do not plot @xmath156 . at the same time",
    ", the pair temperature does not show a adiabatic cooling characteristic of the fireball .",
    "this is due to a distributed coulomb heating by protons .",
    "if this heating is effective up to the photosphere , pair annihilation problem may be significantly alleviated . in this example",
    "the proton temperature @xmath157 at the center is 260 , which corresponds to @xmath158 k. on the other hand , at the boundary , @xmath157 becomes 1760 ( @xmath159 k ) .",
    "since this proton temperature is too high to confine by gravitational potential of the central black hole , protons will also outflow from the surface , which is in contradiction with our basic assumption of a static proton distribution .",
    "the outflow is due to the anisotropy of the photon field . in figure 3",
    "we plot densities of outgoing ( @xmath160 ) and ingoing ( @xmath161 ) photons @xmath162 for @xmath163 in the frame @xmath20 . in the neighborhood of the center",
    "the densities of outgoing and ingoing photons are almost the same within errors in our computation . as it goes outside ,",
    "outgoing photons dominate over ingoing photons .",
    "this is due to the spherical symmetry in geometry and the beaming effect by the mildly relativistic outflow ( see also figure 4 ) .",
    "the very low density of ingoing photons at the boundary assures the validity of our treatment in computation , in which we neglect photons coming from outside of the boundary . because of the beaming effect , the density of outgoing photons is almost constant in the frame @xmath20 , although the photon density in the comoving frame @xmath27 decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "figure 4 shows the photon spectra of outgoing photons for @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the beaming effect is clearly seen in these plots .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the radiative force , frictional force , and reaction force due to photon - emission per particle as ratios of timescales ; the dynamical timescale @xmath166 to the acceleration ( deceleration ) timescale @xmath167 , where @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath108 for the radiative , frictional , and reaction forces , respectively .",
    "the reaction force causes the reduction in the inertia of the flow rather than flow - deceleration .",
    "the radiative force also causes both the increase in the inertia and flow - acceleration .",
    "thus , figure 5 does not directly explain the growth of @xmath45 , but we can see a very powerful role of the radiative force . around the center , the radiative force per particle increases with @xmath11 because of the anisotropy of the photon field .",
    "at @xmath170 , @xmath171 due to the radiative force attains the maximum @xmath172 . outside @xmath131 , the decline of the photon field in the frame @xmath27 leads to the decline of the radiative force per particle . in spite of the powerful radiative force",
    ", @xmath45 does not attain the value expected simply from @xmath173 , because the frictional force competes against the radiative force .",
    "this strong friction will in turn accelerate the background proton - electron plasma .",
    "although we assume that the background plasma is static , in reality it will outflow at a sub - relativistic speed .",
    "although @xmath45 increases monotonically with @xmath11 , the frictional force decreases outside @xmath174 owing to the smaller background density and the cross sections of coulomb scattering above @xmath115 .",
    "the energy outflow rate in the form of the pair - fluid is @xmath175 erg @xmath1 in this example .",
    "the rest of the energy escapes as photons from the boundary . in figure 6",
    "we plot the energy spectrum of the photons escaping from the boundary @xmath176 . by the analogy from the planck spectrum",
    "we can obtain the `` photon temperature '' from the blue - shifted maximum point at @xmath177 in the energy spectrum as @xmath178 , which is close to the pair temperature @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , we could not expect a rise of the pair temperature outside the boundary . for reference",
    ", we also plot the wien spectrum @xmath179 } dx$ ] in figure 6 .",
    "the spectrum has a broader feature than that in the wien spectrum .",
    "although we can see a sign of upscattering of soft photons originating from bremsstrahlungs , there are huge amounts of soft photons ( @xmath180 ) in comparison with the thermal spectrum .    despite of the low photon temperature , the positron creation rate ( see figure 7 ) and",
    "annihilation rate are almost the same within @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , we do not plot the positron annihilation rate in the figure . outside the boundary the flow continues to be accelerated by the radiative force until the photospheric radius .",
    "although the pair annihilation process exceeds the creation process outside @xmath151 , the number of pairs will be frozen at the photospheric radius .",
    "using the results in @xcite , the lorentz factor at the photosphere may be @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the thomson optical depth at the boundary .",
    "the final energy - flux fraction of the outflow to @xmath12 may be on the order of @xmath183 % .    for @xmath146 erg @xmath1",
    ", we have also simulated for another parameter set : @xmath134 cm with @xmath135 @xmath136",
    ". however , the values @xmath143 , @xmath45 , @xmath153 , and @xmath184 at the boundary are almost the same as those in this example .",
    "therefore , the results may not be so sensitive to the compactness of the plasma .",
    "this is the first attempt to produce fireballs from hot plasmas , whose size and density are characteristic of accretion plasma in agns . for microphysics , coulomb scattering , compton scattering , bremsstrahlung ,",
    "electron - positron pair annihilation and creation are taken into account . using the multi - fluid approximation",
    ", we obtain spherically symmetric , steady solutions of radiation and pair outflows for @xmath0 erg @xmath1 . as the luminosity increases , sufficient amount of electron - positron pairs outflow with a mildly relativistic velocity .",
    "the pair outflows are driven by powerful radiative force rather than their own pressure for @xmath185 erg @xmath1 .",
    "although we had expected that the dynamical effect of the outflow would increase the temperature of the pair plasma , in our results of @xmath185 erg @xmath1 , the temperature is rather low to achieve @xmath186 , differently from the assumption in the wien fireball model @xcite . however , this difference should not taken too firmly at the present stage as is discussed below .",
    "there are several caveats in our present simulations .",
    "first , our calculation regime may not be large enough to accurately treat the whole spatial range within the photosphere . distributed heating by protons in the outer region may affect the resultant pair outflow ; one signature seen in the simulation is the lack of an adiabatic cooling in the flow .",
    "secondly , the coulomb friction rate and the resultant proton temperature suggest that protons will also outflow with sub - relativistic velocity .",
    "the flow of the background plasma will somewhat enhance the outflow of the pair - fluids .",
    "if we can raise the temperature to only several times the value in our simulation , the fireball can form a relativistic outflow .",
    "the temperature , density , and velocity of the pair fluid may be strongly influenced by spatial distributions of the heating rate and proton density .",
    "qualitatively speaking , shallower proton density distribution will enhance the outflow , while more centrally concentrated heating rate will enhance the photon luminosity . in order to produce a fireball with a sufficiently high temperature , we need to continue investigating plasmas with different profiles including the flow of the background plasma .",
    "while our simulation is one dimensional , two or three dimensional effects may be important .",
    "another method we should consider is kinematical treatment of the flow . the multi - fluid approximation has been adopted in our simulation for simplicity . to carry out more accurate simulation",
    ", we should solve collisional boltzmann equation taking into account photon emission .",
    "the kinematical treatment may result in a broader distribution of pairs than maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which raises the effective temperature .",
    "the broad photon distribution in our simulation suggests such a possibility .",
    "the effect of the static electric field discussed in  2.3 , which may heat the pair - fluid , can be included in the kinematical treatment .",
    "however , such simulations require enormous cost in computation .",
    "in addition , photon emission from plasmas with multi - component , which is not in maxwell - boltzmann distribution , is too complex to evaluate in advance of simulation .",
    "although the kinematical methods can include several plasma effects we have neglected , such as two - stream instability etc . , simulations based on the multi - fluid approximation are irreplaceable way so far .",
    "in this paper we have obtained steady solutions for outflows .",
    "since the time scale of radiative transfer is much longer than the dynamical time scale , the pair and electron temperatures become low .",
    "the lifetime of accretion plasma may not be long enough to achieve a steady state radiation field obtained here .",
    "as the original idea of the wien fireball model , an instantaneous heating may produce a runaway production of relativistic pairs because of slow annihilation in a hot plasma .",
    "therefore , time - dependent simulations should be examined in a future work .",
    "the authors appreciate the anonymous referee and m. kusunose for their helpful advice . this work is partially supported by scientific research grants ( f.t . 14079205 and 16540215 ) from the ministry of education , culture , science and technology of japan ."
