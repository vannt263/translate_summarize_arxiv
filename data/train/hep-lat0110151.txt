    "lattice calculations of scattering lengths and phase shifts for the pion system is an important step for understanding of strong interactions beyond the hadron mass spectrum .",
    "there are already several studies of scattering lengths in literature . for the @xmath4 process calculations",
    "has been carried out with the staggered  @xcite and the wilson fermion actions  @xcite .",
    "a recent work by jlqcd @xcite carried out the calculation at several lattice cutoffs and obtained the value in the continuum limit . for the @xmath5 process , which is difficult due to the presence of disconnected contributions",
    ", a pioneering attempt has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the scattering phase shift , in contrast , there is only one calculation for @xmath4  @xcite , and the data are still too noisy to obtain reliable results .    in this article",
    "we report on a high statistics calculation of the @xmath4 s - wave pion scattering length and phase shift .",
    "we work in quenched lattice qcd employing the standard plaquette action for gluons and the wilson fermion action for quarks .",
    "simulations are made at @xmath6 using 200 and 173 configurations on a @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattice .",
    "quark propagators are solved with the dirichlet boundary condition imposed in the time direction and the periodic boundary condition in the space directions .",
    "quark masses are chosen to be the same as in the previous study of quenched hadron spectroscopy by cp - pacs  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath9 ) for both lattice sizes .",
    "the energy eigenvalue @xmath10 of an s - wave @xmath0 system with momentum @xmath11 and @xmath12 in a finite periodic box of a size @xmath13 is shifted from twice the pion energy @xmath14 by finite - size effects .",
    "lscher derived a relation between the energy shift @xmath15 and the scattering phase shift @xmath16 , which takes the form @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are geometrical constants .",
    "the scattering length is given by @xmath24 .    in order to obtain the energy eigenvalue",
    "@xmath10 we construct @xmath0 4-point functions @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is an interpolating field for the s - wave @xmath0 system at time @xmath27 given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an element of the cubic group . in numerical calculations",
    "we construct the source operator @xmath30 using the noisy source method with u(1 ) random numbers .",
    "= 7.0 cm    since the 4-point function @xmath31 contains many exponential terms due to the maiani - testa no - go theorem  @xcite , the extraction of energy eigenvalues from @xmath31 is non - trivial .",
    "the following two methods are known  @xcite : ( i ) diagonalization of @xmath31 at each @xmath27 , where the momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33 are regarded as matrix indices .",
    "the eigenvalues take the form @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the distance of @xmath10 from the other eigenvalues @xmath37 . in this method",
    "the fitting range of @xmath27 should be taken large so that the @xmath38 terms can be ignored .",
    "( ii ) diagonalization of @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42_{pk}$ ] at each @xmath27 where @xmath43 is fixed at some small value .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath44 where @xmath38 terms are absent .",
    "in the actual diagonalization we have to cut off the set of momenta . here",
    "we expect that the components of @xmath31 or @xmath45 for @xmath46 are dominant for the eigenvalue @xmath47 in large @xmath27 region , while the components @xmath48 are less important . with this expectation , using both methods",
    "we calculate the energy eigenvalue for the ground state ( @xmath49 ) and the first excited state ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 , and also that of the second excited state ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 .",
    "the cut - off dependence is investigated by varying the number of momenta @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "in order to examine the effects of diagonalization , we calculate two ratios defined by @xmath56 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the pion propagator with momentum @xmath32 . if @xmath59 or @xmath60 behaves as a single exponential function , we can obtain the energy shift @xmath61 easily from the ratio @xmath62 or @xmath63 by a single exponential fit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig ] we compare the ratios for @xmath64 .",
    "the two - pion source is placed at @xmath65 . the momentum cut - off",
    "is set at @xmath66 and both diagonalizations are employed .",
    "the signals are very clear and diagonalizations do not affect the result .",
    "we also checked the cut - off dependence by taking @xmath67 and confirmed that it is negligible . in previous calculations of scattering",
    "lengths@xcite the ratio @xmath68 was used to extract the energy shift @xmath69 .",
    "our calculation demonstrates the reliability of these calculations .",
    "we compare the ratios for @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig2.fig ] .",
    "the momentum cutoff is set at @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the method ( i )",
    "in contrast to the @xmath64 case , the diagonalization is very effective .",
    "the cut - off dependence is negligible , however .",
    "we also made the same analysis for method ( ii ) and confirmed that the results are independent of the method .",
    "the analysis here , and additional one for @xmath71 for @xmath53 , lead us to conclude that ( i ) the momentum cut - off should be taken @xmath54 for the energy shift @xmath61 ( @xmath72 ) , and ( ii ) both method ( i ) and ( ii ) give same results .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] we plot our results of the scattering amplitude @xmath73 obtained by substituting our data for @xmath61 into ( [ lusher.eq ] ) .",
    "the signals are clear in the small momentum region ( upper figure in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] ) but become noiser for larger momenta ( lower figure ) . in order to obtain the scattering length and phase shift for various momenta at the physical pion mass , we extrapolate our data with the following fitting assumption : @xmath74 .",
    "the fit curves are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4.fig ] we compare our results of the phase shift @xmath16 at physical pion mass obtained with the fit above with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the simulation points are plotted by the large square symbols .",
    "our results for @xmath75 are 40% smaller in magnitude than those of experiments , and our result of scattering length , @xmath76 , differs from the chpt prediction given by @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "a possible cause of the discrepancy is finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "the jlqcd results for scattering length @xcite show sizable scaling violation , and hence that of the scattering phase shift can not be considered small .",
    "further calculations nearer to the continuum limit or calculations with improved actions are desirable .      this work is supported in part by grants - in - aid of the ministry of education ( nos .  10640246 , 10640248 , 11640250 , 11640294 , 12014202 , 12304011 , 12640253 , 12740133 , 13640260 ) .",
