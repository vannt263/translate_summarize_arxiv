    "the gravitational - unstable and collapsing subset of the molecular cloud cores are known as prestellar cores ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) , which will convert to an individual stellar system with its universal initial mass function ( offner et al .",
    "thus , investigation of the prestellar cores is essential to understand the initial stages of star ( and stellar system ) formation .",
    "many authors use the usual _ isothermal _ bonnor - ebert sphere ( e.g. stahler & palla  2004 , section  9.1 ) to approximate the density profiles of observed prestellar cores ( e.g , marsh et al .",
    "2016 ) . however , in general , the assumption of _ isothermal case _ is not accurately valid because real dense cores are subjected to heating and cooling processes ( goldsmith & langer  1978 ) . for this purpose , some authors assumed _ non - isothermal cases _ to approximate self - consistently the temperature and density profiles through the thermally balanced hydrostatic spherical prestellar cores ( e.g. , evans  ii et al .",
    "2001 , juvela & ysard  2011 , spil , harju & juvela  2015 ) . in these works for non - isothermal modified bonnor - ebert spheres ( mbes ) , the ambipolar diffusion ( ad )",
    "heating was not considered , while in the magnetic fluctuating medium , this heating mechanism is very important ( e.g. , li , myers & mckee  2012 ) .",
    "observations of prestellar cores show the effects of magnetic turbulence through them .",
    "for example , hildebrand et al .",
    "( 2009 ) developed a method based on a dispersion function about local mean magnetic fields . besides providing a measure for the turbulent dispersion",
    ", their method also gives an accurate estimate of the turbulent to the mean magnetic field strength ratio .",
    "koch , tang & ho  ( 2010 ) applied and extended the method developed in hildebrand et al .",
    "( 2009 ) across a range of scales in the same star formation regions .",
    "they found the magnetic field turbulent dispersion , its turbulent - to - mean field strength ratio , and the large - scale polarization angle correlation length as a function of the physical scale at the star formation sites .",
    "girart et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also found evidence of magnetic field diffusion at the core scales , far beyond the expected value for ad .",
    "they concluded that it may be possible that the diffusion arises from fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence .",
    "similarly , we can also refer to the recent observational evidences of pillai et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and houde et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "magnetic turbulence can produce magnetic fluctuations through prestellar molecular cloud cores .",
    "thus , prestellar cores are a magnetically fluctuating medium , and the ad heating is important and must be considered . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the physical situation of a spherically symmetric , gravitationally bound , thermally supported prestellar core , which is also heated by internal magnetic slippage of particles with ad mechanism in the magnetic fluctuating medium .",
    "section  2 gives the formulation of the quasi - static thermally equilibrium prestellar cores , and in section  3 some remarkable conclusions are presented .",
    "in spherical polar coordinates , the usual hydrodynamic equations for spherically symmetric thermally dominated cases are @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where the mass density @xmath6 , the enclosed mass @xmath7 , the radial flow velocity @xmath8 , the thermal gas pressure @xmath9 , and the temperature @xmath10 , in general , depend on the radius @xmath11 and time @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the polytropic index , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are boltzmann constant , the mean molecular weight and the hydrogen mass , respectively .",
    "the net cooling function is represented by @xmath18 .    in the stationary ( @xmath19 ) quasi - static ( @xmath20 )",
    "thermally equilibrium state , the net cooling function @xmath18 must be zero at each radius @xmath11 ( i.e. , locally thermal balance ) . to calculate the thermal balance within the molecular cloud cores , we need to consider heating and cooling processes affecting the gas and the dust .",
    "for cooling processes , we use the table  2 of goldsmith  ( 2001 ) to parameterize the cooling function as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are generally functions of density ( see , fig .  1 of nejad - asghar  2011 ) .",
    "there are several different heating mechanisms in models of interstellar matter . here",
    ", we consider heating processes of cosmic rays ( e.g. , glassgold & langer  1973 ) and dissipation of magnetic energy via ad ( e.g. , li , myers & mckee  2012 ) .",
    "the heating due to cosmic rays with sufficient energies ( @xmath24 ) to penetrate dense clouds is commonly about @xmath25 , with assumption of an ionization rate per @xmath26 molecule of @xmath27 and a mean energy gains per ionization of @xmath28 ( glassgold & langer  1973 ) .",
    "the heating due to ad can be obtained by low ionization fraction approximation . in the limit of low ionization fraction ( i.e. , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are neutral and ion densities , respectively ) , the inertia of charged particles being negligible so that the lorentz force will be balanced by the equally important drag force .",
    "the drag force per unit volume exerted on the neutrals by ions is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the collisional drag coefficient in the molecular clouds , and we used the relation @xmath34 between ion and neutral densities in the local ionization equilibrium state with @xmath35 ( shu  1992 ) . in this way , the drift velocity of ions is @xmath36 the magnitude of drift velocity , @xmath37 , is inversely proportional to the power of density and directly proportional to the magnetic field strength and its gradient .",
    "shu  ( 1992 , equation  27.9 ) used typical values of @xmath38 to estimate the typical drift speeds through the molecular clouds .",
    "li , myers & mckee  ( 2012 ) divided the magnetic field into a steady component and a fluctuating one , and used the mean squared method to estimate upper limits on the drift speed . here",
    ", we use the parametric relation @xmath39 , where the parameter @xmath40 is the change of magnetic field strength in the length - scale @xmath41 . in this way",
    ", the heating due to ambipolar diffusion can be represented as @xmath42    the magnetic field strength , @xmath43 , is evaluated in the troland & crutcher  ( 2008 ) for a set of @xmath44 molecular cloud cores .",
    "their evaluations show that the magnetic field strengths are in the range of @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the authors use a scaling relation of the field strength with density , which is usually parameterized as a power law , @xmath47 ( crutcher  2012 ) . in the strong - field models , @xmath48 is predicted ( e.g. , mouschovias & ciolek  1999 ) , while for weak magnetic fields , @xmath49 is predicted ( mestel  1966 ) . here , we assume that the magnetic field is so strong that as ambipolar diffusion increases the mass - to - flux ratio , the density @xmath6 increases faster than @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we are in strong - field models with @xmath48 . according to the figure  6 of crutcher  ( 2012 )",
    ", we choose an approximate value of @xmath50 for number density @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for number density @xmath53 . by choosing these values for the magnetic field strengths",
    ", we have a power - law approximation as @xmath54 . in this way , the condition for domination of thermal pressure over the magnetic pressure is @xmath55 . according to the table  1 of koch , tang & ho  ( 2010 ) ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath56 is @xmath57 , which corresponds to cloud core with dimension @xmath58 at w51  e2/e8 , observed with sma interferometer . on the other hand , like the work of li , myers & mckee  ( 2012 ) , we assume that the ad heating , which is produced by magnetic fluctuations , is wave dissipation with its maximum wavelength equal to the physical scale @xmath59 . in this way",
    ", gradients can not exist on scales larger than @xmath60 . here , we choose the minimum value of @xmath59 equal to @xmath61 , which corresponds to the cloud core at orion  bn / kl , observed with sma interferometer ( koch , tang & ho  2010 , table  1 ) , so that we have @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we expect the maximum value of the parameter @xmath0 in the prestellar cores be equal to @xmath63 . since there is a lot of uncertainties in the values of the magnetic field fluctuations and dissipation scales , we assume a parametric value for @xmath0 , which includes roughly all of these uncertainties .",
    "we express @xmath0 in the unit of @xmath64 and perform the calculations for @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the ad heating ( [ heatingad ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath66    the thermal balance ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) at the molecular clouds leads to a relation between the temperature and density as follows @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{\\beta(n)}}.\\ ] ] the results of ( [ temp ] ) are plotted in the fig .",
    "[ tempfig ] , for different values of @xmath69 .",
    "the dash - line in this figure , @xmath70 , shows that our assumption of thermally dominated prestellar core is approximately correct , especially for greater values of @xmath0 .",
    "departure from the thermally dominated assumption leads to consideration of the pressures from both mhd turbulence and the mean field gradient ; the resulting equilibrium configuration will not be spherical . here",
    ", we use the spherical assumption for prestellar cores as a first approximation , and the effects of magnetic pressures will be considered in the subsequent work .",
    "now , knowing the relation between temperature and density , equation ( [ state ] ) leads us to determine the gradient of pressure as @xmath71 so that the stationary ( @xmath19 ) quasi - static ( @xmath20 ) state of the momentum equation ( [ moment ] ) becomes @xmath72 we use the non - dimensional quantities @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the reference density and temperature , respectively . in this way",
    ", the equations ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ hydrost ] ) become @xmath79 @xmath80 which can be integrated numerically ( e.g. , with runge - kutta method ) , from the origin @xmath81 with the boundary conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the non - dimensional central density .",
    "the results for density and temperature profiles of the stationary quasi - static thermally equilibrium prestellar cores with central density @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are shown in the fig .",
    "[ dentempradius ] .",
    "the profiles of isothermal case ( @xmath88 ) are also plotted in this figure , for comparison . as can be seen",
    ", consideration of the ad heating departs the profiles of the stationary quasi - static thermally equilibrium prestellar cores from the isothermal case .",
    "these departures are greater for greater magnetic fluctuating parameter @xmath0 , at the envelopes of the prestellar cores with smaller densities .",
    "this result for departure of profiles is consistent with the fig .",
    "[ tempfig ] , which shows that importance of ad heating is at lower densities .    in the actual cases ,",
    "the density does not fall to zero , but to some value @xmath89 characterizing the external medium .",
    "if we fix @xmath89 , for each density contrast @xmath90 , we can find the radius @xmath91 of the prestellar core and its corresponding non - dimensional mass @xmath92 .",
    "the molecular cloud core mass , @xmath93 , versus logarithm of density contrast , @xmath94 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] , for three different values of density of external medium equal to @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . with",
    "increasing density contrast , core mass first rises to a maximum value of @xmath98 , attained at the radius @xmath99 .",
    "then , the mass drops to a minimum , and eventually approaches in an oscillatory fashion to the asymptotic limit value , which represents the mass of the singular sphere ( with density @xmath100 ) . in the isothermal bonnor - ebert case ,",
    "the density contrast corresponded to the first maximum is @xmath101 ( e.g. , stahler & palla  2004 , figure  9.2 ) .",
    "prestellar cores with low density contrast are mainly confined by the external pressure , and not self - gravity .",
    "this situation changes as we progress along the curves in the fig .",
    "[ massfig ] to the right of the first maximum ( i.e. , models of higher @xmath94 ) .",
    "these prestellar cores have gravity - dominated configurations , and an arbitrarily small initial perturbation in the structure grows rapidly with time , leading ultimately to collapse . in the isothermal case , a cloud with the critical value of mass and radius corresponding to the first maximum is known as the bonnor - ebert sphere . for non - isothermal cases , we use the nomenclature of modified bonnor - ebert sphere ( mbes ) .",
    "the critical values of mass and radius of the mbess , versus @xmath0 , are plotted in the fig .",
    "[ rmbefig ] , for different values of external densities .",
    "the fluctuations of the magnetic field strength through the molecular clouds can produce ad heating . in this research , the effects of ad heating to produce temperature gradient through thermally supported , dynamically balanced prestellar spherical cores are investigated .",
    "this temperature gradient changes the maximum allowed mass and radius of the gravitationally stable cores ( i.e. , mbes ) .",
    "the issue of mbes is important in the star formation theory .",
    "thermal balance of the molecular clouds demand forcefully a relation between density and temperature as outlined in fig .",
    "[ tempfig ] , for different values of magnetic fluctuation parameter @xmath0 . from thermal balancing state ( fig .",
    "[ tempfig ] ) , we know the relation between temperature and density , so that we can find both temperature @xmath102 and density @xmath103 in which the stationary hydrostatic equilibrium of prestellar cores are satisfied .",
    "the results for temperature and density profiles are shown in the fig .",
    "[ dentempradius ] .",
    "the inclusion of ad heating leads to the departure of the density and temperature profiles from the isothermal case , especially in the outer regions of envelope with lower densities .",

    "the prestellar cores with masses lower than @xmath98 are gravitationally stable , while if the core mass reaches to the critical value @xmath98 or a larger value , the core will be gravitationally unstable and collapse occurs . the fig .",
