    "evolutionary game theory is used on different levels of biological systems , ranging from the genetic level to ecological systems . the language of game theory allows to address basic questions of ecology , related to the emergence of cooperation and biodiversity , as well as the formation of coalitions with applications to social systems .",
    "darwinian dynamics , in particular frequency - dependent selection , can be formulated in terms of game - theoretic arguments @xcite .",
    "the formation of dynamical patterns is considered as one of the most important promoters of biodiversity @xcite .",
    "here we consider games of competition , where the competition is realized as predation among @xmath1 species , where each species preys on @xmath3 others in a cyclic way .",
    "a subclass of these @xmath0-games are cyclic games , that is @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the famous rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "an extensive overview on cyclic games is given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-game has been studied in various extensions ( spatial , reproduction and deletion , swapping or diffusion , mutation ) .",
    "one of the first studies of a @xmath5-game without spatial assignment , but in a deterministic and stochastic realization revealed that fluctuations due to a finite number of agents can drastically alter the mean - field predictions , including an estimate of the extinction probabilities at a given time @xcite .",
    "this model was extended to include a spatial grid in @xcite , where the role of stochastic fluctuations and spatial diffusion was analyzed both numerically and analytically .",
    "the influence of species mobility on species diversity was studied in @xcite , pattern formation close to a bifurcation point was the topic of @xcite , see also @xcite and the impact of asymmetric interactions was considered in @xcite .",
    "an extension to four species , first without spatial assignment , shows interesting new features as compared to @xmath5 : already in the deterministic limit the trajectories show a variety of possible orbits , and from a certain conserved quantity the late - time behavior can be extrapolated @xcite .",
    "the four species can form alliance pairs similarly to the game of bridge @xcite .",
    "under stochastic evolution various extinction scenarios and the competition of the surviving set of species can be analyzed @xcite .",
    "domains and their separating interfaces were studied in @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 cyclic games on a spatial grid were the topic in @xcite .",
    "a phase transition as a function of the concentration of vacant sites is identified between a phase of four coexisting species and a phase with two neutral species that protect each other and extend their domain over the grid . for an extension of this model to long - range selection",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the @xmath7-game , including both spiral formation inside domains and domain formation .",
    "it is a special case of @xmath0-games , which were considered for @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite were the first to notice that for certain combinations of n and r one observes the coexistence of both spiral formation and domain formation .",
    "however , it should be noticed that our set of reactions , even if we specialize @xmath0 to the @xmath5-game , is similar , but not identical with the versions , considered in @xcite or in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the seemingly minor difference refers to the implementation of an upper threshold to the occupation number of single sites ( set to 1 or a finite fixed number ) , while we use a  bosonic \" version .",
    "we introduce a dynamical threshold , realized via deletion reactions , so that we need not explicitly restrict the occupation number per site . due to this difference , the bifurcation structure of the mean - field equations is changed .    the reason why we are interested in the particular combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is primarily motivated by two theoretical aspects rather than by concrete applications . as to the first aspect ,",
    "this game is one of the simplest examples of  games within games \" in the sense that the domains effectively play a @xmath12-game as transient dynamics on a coarse scale ( the scale of the domain diameter ) , while the actors inside the domains play a @xmath5-game on the grid scale .",
    "finally , one of the domains gets extinct along with all its actors . as such",
    ", this game provides a simple , yet non - trivial example for a mechanism that may be relevant for evolution : in our case , due to the spatial segregation of species , the structural complexity of the system increases in the form of patterns of who is chasing whom , appearing as long - living transients , along with a seemingly change of the rules of the game that is played between the competing domains on the coarse scale , while the rules , which individuals use on the elementary grid sites , are not changed at all .",
    "as outlined by goldenfeld and woese @xcite , it is typical for processes in evolution , in particular in ecology , that  the governing rules are themselves changed \" , as the system evolves in time and the rules depend on the state . in our example",
    "it is spatial segregation , which allows for a change of rules from a coarse perspective , as we shall see .",
    "as to the second aspect , an interesting feature of such an arrangement is the multitude of time and spatial scales that are dynamically generated . concretely in the @xmath7-game the largest of the reaction / diffusion rates sets the basic time unit . when the species segregate and form domains , the next scale is generated : it is the time it takes the two domains to form until both cover the two - dimensional grid or the one - dimensional chain .",
    "the domains are not static , but play the @xmath12-game that has a winner in the end .",
    "so the extinction time of one of the domains sets the third scale .",
    "a single domain then survives , including the moving spirals from the remaining @xmath5-game inside the domain .",
    "the transients can last very long , depending on the interaction rates and the system size . in the very end , however , in a stochastic realization as well as due to the finite accuracy in the numerical solutions even in the mean - field description , only one out of the three species will survive , and the extinction of the other two species sets the fourth scale . along with these events , spatial scales",
    "emerge , ranging from the basic lattice constant to the radii of spirals and the extension of the domains .",
    "one of the challenges is to explore which of the observed features in the gillespie simulations can be predicted analytically .",
    "we shall study the predictions on the mean - field level , which is rather conclusive in our ultralocal implementation of reactions and reproduces the results of the gillespie simulations quite well , since fluctuations turn out to play a minor role for pattern formation .",
    "the deterministic equations are derived as the lowest order of a van kampen expansion .",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian are conclusive for the number of surviving species in a stable state , the composition of the domains , and transient behavior , which is observed in the gillespie simulations .",
    "the mean - field equations , including the diffusion term , will be integrated numerically and compared to the results of the gillespie simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_reactions ]",
    "we present the model in terms of basic reactions and the corresponding master equation . for generic @xmath0 games we summarize in section  [ sec_vankampen ] the derivation of the mean - field equations from a van kampen expansion , followed by a stability analysis via the jacobian with and without spatial dependence for the specific @xmath7 game , and a derivation of the numerical solutions of the mean - field equations in section  [ sec_jacobian ] . in section  [ sec_numerical ]",
    "we present our results from the gillespie simulations in comparison to the mean - field results .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions and gives an outlook to further challenges related to this class of games . for comparison",
    ", the supplementary material contains a detailed stability analysis for the @xmath5-game with spiral formation and the @xmath13-game with domain formation , as well as the numerical solutions of the mean - field equations and the corresponding gillespie simulations .",
    "we start with the simplest set of reactions that represent predation between individuals of different species , followed by reproduction , deletion @xmath14 and finally diffusion @xmath15 @xmath16 represents an individual of species @xmath17 at lattice site @xmath18 , while the total number of individuals of species @xmath17 at site @xmath18 will be denoted with @xmath19 .",

    "( [ pred ] ) represents the predation of species @xmath17 on species @xmath21 with rate @xmath22 , where the parameter @xmath23 does not stand for the physical volume , but parameterizes the distance from the deterministic limit in the following way : according to our set of reactions , larger values of @xmath23 lead to higher occupation numbers @xmath19 of species @xmath17 at sites @xmath18 , since predation and deletion events are rescaled with a factor @xmath24 , and therefore to a larger total rate .",
    "the fluctuations in occupation numbers , realized via the gillespie algorithm , are independent of @xmath23 or the occupation numbers of sites , since only relative rates enter the probabilities for a certain reaction to happen .",
    "therefore the size of the fluctuations relative to the absolute occupation numbers or to the overall @xmath23 gets reduced for large v , that is , in the deterministic limit .",
    "predation is schematically described in figure  [ ( 6,3 ) ] .",

    "death processes are needed to compensate for the reproduction events , since we do not impose any restriction on the number of individuals that can occupy lattice sites . here",
    "we should remark why we implement death processes in the form of eq .",

    "all fixed points collide and exchange stability through a multiple transcritical bifurcation . for @xmath33 ( the only case of interest ) , the system has no stable fixed points , and the numerical integration of the differential equations diverges .",

    "the species diffuse within a two - dimensional lattice , which we reduce to one dimension for simplicity if we analyze the behavior in more detail .",
    "we assume that there can be more than one individual of one or more species at each lattice site .",
    "individuals perform a random walk on the lattice with rate @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the diffusion constant , @xmath36 the lattice constant and @xmath37 the dimension of the grid .",
    "diffusion is described by eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , where @xmath18 represents the site from which an individual hops , and @xmath38 is one of the neighboring sites to which it hops .",
    "it should be noticed that diffusion is the only place , which leads to a spatial dependence of the results , since apart from diffusion , species interact on - site , that is , within their patch .    in summary ,",
    "the main differences to other related work such as references @xcite are the ultralocal implementation of prey and predation , no swapping , no mutations as considered in @xcite , and a bosonic version with a dynamically ensured finite occupation number of sites .",
    "even if qualitatively similar patterns like spirals or domains are generated in all these versions , the bifurcation diagram , that is , the stability properties and the mode of transition from one to another regime depend on the specific implementation .",

    "let us first give an overview of the sequence of events , if we vary the bifurcation parameters @xmath98 and @xmath30 as @xmath99 .",

    "* @xmath82 : the first regime with @xmath99 smaller than its value at the first hopf bifurcation at @xmath87 , where the 6-species coexistence fixed point becomes unstable .",
    "as long as this fixed point is stable , we see no patterns , as the system converges at each site of the grid to the 6-species fixed point without dominance of any species , so that the uniform color is gray .",
    "* @xmath100 : the second regime with @xmath99 chosen between the first and second hopf bifurcations , where the second one happens at @xmath101 for the @xmath75 fixed points .",
    "when @xmath87 is approached from below , that is from @xmath82 , two fixed points , belonging to the @xmath75-group , become stable through a transcritical bifurcation until @xmath101 , where they become unstable through the second hopf bifurcation . each of the two predicts the survival of three species , the ones , which are found inside the domains .",
    "each of these fixed points is , of course , a single - site fixed point , so in principle a subset of the nodes of the grid can individually approach one of the two fixed points , while the complementary set of the nodes would approach the other fixed point . however , as a transient we see two well separated domains with either even or odd species . at the interfaces between them all six species",
    "are present and oscillate with small amplitude oscillations , caused by the first hopf bifurcation of the six - species coexistence fixed - point , where it became a saddle .",
    "which one of the domains wins the effective ( 2,1)-game in the end , where a single domain with all its three species survives , depends on the initial conditions and on the fact that diffusion is included ; the mere stability analysis only suggests that six species at a site destabilize the interface between domains with either even or odd species .",
    "in fact , the numerical integration and the gillespie simulations both show that one domain gets extinct if the lattice size is small enough and/or the diffusion fast enough .",
    "as long as the two fixed points are stable , the ( 3,1)-game is played at each site of a domain in the sense of coexisting three species , which are not chasing each other , related to the neighboring sites only via diffusion , without forming any patterns .",
    "patterns are only visible at the interface of the domains as a remnant of the unstable six - species coexistence fixed point .",
    "* @xmath102 : the third regime , which is of most interest for pattern formation .",
    "starting from random initial conditions , the species segregate first into two domains , each consisting of three species , one with species 1,3 , and 5 , the second one with species 2 , 4 , and 6 , and inside both domains the three species play a rock - paper - scissors game , chasing each other , since the two fixed points of the @xmath75 group became unstable at the second hopf bifurcation .",
    "due to the interactions according to an effective @xmath12-game at the interfaces of the domains ( here with either two or four species coexisting ) , one of the domains will also here get extinct , including the involved three species , while the remaining three survive . which domain survives depends also here on the initial conditions .",
    "as we shall see , the temporal trajectories of the concentrations of the three species in the surviving domain show that they still explore the vicinity of the second hopf bifurcation from time to time , while they otherwise are attracted by the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "the three species in the surviving domain live the longer , the larger the grid size is , in which the species continue playing ( 3,1 ) .",
    "in contrast to the second regime , however , two of the three species in the surviving domain will get extinct as well , and a single one remains in the end .",
    "this extinction is caused by fluctuations in the finite population in the stochastic simulation or by the numerical integration on a spatial grid with finite numerical accuracy , respectively .",
    "so the linear stability analysis indicates options for when we can expect oscillatory trajectories : it is the hopf bifurcations in the ( 6,3)-game for the @xmath80 and @xmath75 fixed points that induce the creation of limit cycles , which here lead to the _ formation of spirals _ in space in the third regime and only temporary patterns at the interfaces in the second regime , before the system converges to one of the @xmath75 fixed points .",
    "moreover , it is the two @xmath75 fixed points in the ( 6,3)-game that correspond to the _ formation of two domains_. in both the ( 3,2 ) and the ( 6,3)-games , one of these fixed points will be approached as a collective fixed point ( shared by all sites of the grid ) , while the domain corresponding to the other one gets extinct , and patterns are seen if this fixed point is unstable .",
    "so in the ( 6,3)-game the existence of domains including their very composition is due to two stable ( second regime ) or unstable ( third regime ) fixed points .",
    "their coexistence is in both regimes transient . in the second regime",
    "three species will survive in the end , because the three - species coexistence - fixed point is stable , and it would need a large fluctuation to kick it towards a 1-species unstable fixed point . in contrast , only one species will survive in the third regime , where the same fixed point is unstable . obviously here",
    "it does not need a rare , large fluctuation to kick the system towards the 1-species unstable fixed point , as we always observed a single species to survive in the end , both in the gillespie simulations and the numerical integration in a relatively short time .",
    "we should mention , however , that from our gillespie simulations we can not exclude that after all , a large fluctuation would also kick the system in the second regime from its metastable state towards one of the unstable 1-species fixed points as well as in the first regime to either one of the two three - species fixed points , or to one of the six 1-species fixed points , when the six - species fixed point is stable in the deterministic limit .",

    "therefore also here the coexistence of domains is not stable , only one of them survives , and which one depends on the initial conditions , resulting in the extinction of three either odd or even species . in view of gillespie simulations , figures  [ ( 6,3)_array_osc ] ( a ) ( early times ) and ( b ) ( late times )",

    "apart from the amplitude , the heteroclinic and saddle - limit cycles differ in their frequency : the saddle - limit cycle has a higher frequency than the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the spatial trajectories at the beginning of the integration when both domains still coexist .",

    "according to figure  [ ( 6,3)_array_oscend](a ) all trajectories get absorbed in one ( the pink one ) of the 1-species saddles already at finite time as a result of the finite accuracy of the numerical integration . yet figure  [ ( 6,3)_array_oscend ] ( b ) shows the characteristics of a heteroclinic cycle at finite time : the dwell time of the trajectory in the vicinity of the 1-species saddles gets longer and longer in each cycle , before it fast moves towards the next saddle in the cycle .",
    "this escape stops after a finite number of cycles , when the concentration of two of the three species are zero within the numerical accuracy , and therefore no  resurrection \" is possible .",
    "going back to the set of reactions , in this section we describe their gillespie simulations .",
    "we solve the system ( [ eq : rec_sys ] ) by stochastic simulations on a regular square lattice as well as on a one - dimensional ring , using the gillespie algorithm  @xcite , combined with the so - called next - subvolume method  @xcite .",
    "this method is one option to generalize gillespie simulations to spatial grids .",
    "we choose periodic boundary conditions on a square @xmath109 lattice or on a ring with @xmath110 nodes . in our case nodes , or synonymously sites , represent subvolumes .",
    "all reactions except of the diffusion happen between individuals on the same site ( in the same subvolume ) , and a diffusion reaction is a jump of one individual to a neighboring site .",
    "one event can change the state of the system of only one ( if a reaction happens ) or two neighboring ( if a diffusion event happens ) subvolumes . at each site",
    "the initial number of individuals of each species is chosen from a poisson distribution @xmath111 , with a mean @xmath49 , which is randomly chosen for each species @xmath17 .    in the next - subvolume method",
    "we assign the random times of the gillespie algorithm to subvolumes rather than to a specific reaction . to each subvolume , or site ,",
    "we assign a time @xmath112 , at which one of the possible events , in our case reactions ( predation , birth or death ) , or diffusion , will happen .",
    "the time @xmath112 is calculated as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a random number generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 . the total rate @xmath115 depends on the reaction rates and the number of individuals which participate in the event .",
    "events happen at sites in the order of the assigned times @xmath112 .",
    "once it is known at which subvolume the next event happens , the event ( reaction or diffusion ) is chosen randomly according to the specified reaction rates .",
    "we start the simulations with initial conditions from a poisson distribution such that each site of the entire lattice is well mixed with all species .",
    "we want to study the dynamics of the system in a parameter regime , where we expect pattern formation . from the linear stability analysis of the mean - field system",
    "we expect stable patterns in the regime without stable fixed points in the ( 6,3)-game , as long as three species are alive , and transient patterns in the ( 6,3)-game for coexisting stable fixed points .",
    "we use the same color scheme as we used before to visualize the numerical solutions of the mean - field equations . as one gillespie step ( gs )",
    "we count one integration step here .",
    "our results confirm the predictions from the mean - field analysis : there are on - site oscillations in time in a limit - cycle regime .",
    "there are also oscillations in space , which form spirals on two - dimensional lattices .",
    "if the evolution approaches the stochastic counterpart of a stable fixed point in the deterministic limit , we call it shortly  noisy fixed point \" , where the trajectories fluctuate around a value that is the mean field - fixed point value multiplied by the parameter @xmath23 as defined before . of particular interest",
    "is the influence of the diffusion in relation to the ratio @xmath99 on the patterns .",
    "it was the ratio of @xmath99 that determines the stability of the fixed points . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the value of @xmath116 , which enters the stability analysis , can extend the stability regime .",
    "so in the gillespie simulations it is intrinsically hard to disentangle the following two reasons for the absence of patterns in the case of fast diffusion : either the stability regime of a fixed point with only one surviving species is extended , or the diffusion is so fast , that the extension of visible patterns is larger than the system size , so that a uniform color may just reflect the homogeneous part within a large pattern .",
    "all the mean - field - fixed points are proportional to the value of the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "if this value is much larger than @xmath98 and @xmath30 , the fixed - point value is very large .",
    "this leads to a large occupation on the sites , which slows down the formation of patterns .",
    "the reason is that the number of reactions , which are needed for the system to evolve to stable trajectories , either to oscillations , or to fixed points , increases with the number of individuals in the system .",
    "we study the stochastic dynamics of a ( 6,3)-game in regimes , for which we expect pattern formation , i.e. for @xmath117 .",
    "when the coexistence - fixed point @xmath80 becomes unstable at @xmath118 , we find the formation of two domains , each consisting of three species , one domain containing odd species , in the figures represented by shared colors red , green , and blue in the rgb - color scheme .",
    "the other domain consists of even species , represented by shared colors of cyan , magenta , and yellow in the cmy - color representation , see figure  [ ( 6,3)2d ] . inside the domains",
    "the three species play the ( 3,1)-game and form spiral patterns .",
    "we have checked that the domains in figure  [ ( 6,3)2d ] are not an artefact of the visualization , and determined , for example , the occupancy on a middle column of the lattice ( not displayed here ) . on sites with oscillations of species from one domain",
    ", there is a very small or no occupation of species of the second domain , confirming the very existence of the domains .",
    "the time evolution of the six species on two sites , chosen , for example , from the middle column of the lattice confirm that the species trajectories oscillate in time , reflecting the stable limit cycles in the deterministic limit .    here",
    "a remark is in order as to whether radii , propagation velocity or other features of the observed spiral patterns can be predicted analytically . while spiral patterns in spatial rock - paper - scissors games were very well predicted via a multi - scale expansion in the work of @xcite , we performed a multi - scale expansion ( see , for example @xcite ) to derive amplitude equations for the time evolution of deviations from the two unstable fixed points , which lose their stability at the two hopf bifurcations .",
    "however , the resulting amplitude equations differ from ginzburg - landau equations by a missing imaginary part , which can be traced back to the absence of an explicit constraint to the occupation numbers on sites and the absence of a conserved total number of individuals . as a result",
    ", the amplitude equations only predict the transient evolution as long as the trajectory is in the very vicinity of the unstable fixed point , but can not capture the long - time behavior , which here is determined by an attraction towards the heteroclinic cycle that is responsible for the spiral patterns in our case .",
    "so it seems to be this non - local feature in phase space that the multi - scale expansion about the hopf bifurcation misses .    for a further discussion of how the patterns depend on the choice of parameters we shall focus on the results on a one - dimensional lattice , since the simulation times are much longer for two dimensions .",

    "two to four species coexist at a site , but for small enough diffusion , coexistence - fixed points of the respective species are always saddles , so also here the instability of the interfaces seems to induce their avoidance , leading again to the extinction of one of the two domains .",

    "figure  [ ( 3,1)1d_2 ] ( b ) should be compared with the mean - field prediction of figure  [ ( 3,1)_array_beg ] ( c ) , although the @xmath98-values were chosen differently , but out of the same regime .",
    "the patterns qualitatively agree .    for stronger diffusion",
    "the spatial extension of waves is wider , the period of oscillations is larger , they are more homogeneous on the lattice at a given instant of time .",
    "as expected , the stronger the diffusion , the more homogeneous the lattice looks like .",
    "stronger diffusion also leads to a faster extinction of all but one species , this can be explained in the following way . in the stochastic simulations ,",
    "extinctions happen after some time , and since the reproduction rate is proportional to the existing individuals of a certain kind , no  resurrection \" is possible .",
    "extinctions are caused both by the finite spatial size and by the finite number of individuals .",
    "the finite size goes along with a smaller total number of individuals on the grid , while the finite number of individuals per site is tuned by the parameter v. whenever the number of individuals is smaller , the size of the demographic fluctuations gets larger in relation to average occupations of the deterministic limit . these fluctuations in the trajectories",
    "in phase space can kick the system into a parameter regime , where only a subset of species survives as the final fate of the system ; the kick happens the faster , the stronger the fluctuations . also for stronger diffusion , extinction happens faster than for weak diffusion , since the system faster feels the finite grid size .",
    "since extinction events do not happen coherently all over the grid , extinction of a certain species all over the grid takes the longer , the larger the grid .",
    "one may wonder whether strong diffusion can compensate for a large grid size with smaller demographic fluctuations and accelerate the extinction of species .",
    "for the range of parameter values , which we have chosen , the effect of demographic fluctuations dominated the impact of diffusion , so that extinction events decreased with increasing system size for both weak and stronger diffusion .    figure  [ ( 3,1)1d_1 ] ( d ) shows the time evolution on a one - dimensional lattice for strong diffusion and close to the bifurcation point .",
    "this regime allows for more regular oscillations in time ( compare figure  [ ( 3,1)1d_1 ] ( d ) with  [ ( 3,1)1d_2 ] ( c ) ) and a homogeneous arrangement in space .",
    "it is the distance from the bifurcation point in the parameter space influences the patterns .",
    "the larger the distance from the bifurcation point is , that is , the larger @xmath99 ratio , the more disordered the patterns are , see figure  [ ( 3,1)1d_2 ] ( c ) .",
    "the reason is that the amplitudes of the `` noisy limit cycles '' are the larger , the farther the hopf bifurcation to the stable fixed point is .",
    "the larger their amplitude , the closer the trajectories come to the unstable fixed points , which are saddles , so the trajectories first get attracted and later repelled by the saddles and this way distorted , as we see in figure  [ ( 3,1)1d_2 ] ( c ) .",
    "although the width of the wave - like patterns , which are oscillations in space and time , are of the same order for both considered ratios of @xmath99 , for a larger ratio of @xmath99 this width fluctuates more , see figures  [ ( 3,1)1d_1 ] and [ ( 3,1)1d_2 ] .",
    "the `` v''- and `` z''-like shapes of waves on an @xmath177-lattice are analogous to the multiple spiral centers on a two - dimensional lattice , in 2d we find multiple sources , which emit wave fronts that propagate in ( t , x)-space and create `` v '' and `` z '' shapes , when colliding with each other .",
    "the diffusion strength and the distance from the bifurcation point have a similar influence on the patterns as in the ( 3,1)-game .",
    "figures  [ ( 3,2)2d_1 ] and [ ( 3,2)2d_2 ] show a domain formation in the @xmath13-game on a two - dimensional lattice for two different strengths of the diffusion constant .",
    "a domain consists of connected lattice sites , on which one species is dominant .",
    "consider the number of individuals of the dominant species relative to the total number of individuals on a certain site within domain .",
    "this number is smaller on the edges of the domain than in the center of it . in the center",
    "it often happens that the dominant species is the only one occupying the sites in the center .",
    "the interaction between domains , and therefore between species , happens only at the boundaries of the domains .",
    "the boundaries are distinguished as sites with a well mixed occupation , with individuals of two or sometimes all three species .    , @xmath217 , that is far off the bifurcation point , and @xmath218=0.1 ( for ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) , and @xmath125 ( for ( d ) ) .",
    "the panels show the evolution of patterns staring at 0 ( a ) , @xmath219 ( b ) , @xmath122 ( c ) , and 0 ( d ) gs . ]    here the distance from the bifurcation parameter does not seem to influence the extinction times on one - dimensional lattices .",
    "the corresponding figures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the time it takes for one or more species to go extinct , is of the same order of magnitude for different ratios of @xmath99 if the diffusion constant is the same .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the ( 3,1)-game , where the extinction times depend on the distance from the bifurcation point in parameter space . in case of the ( 3,1)-game ,",
    "the mean - field solutions are a heteroclinic cycle in the infinite volume limit , in which all species coexist , so the main mechanisms by which extinction can happen in a stochastic realization are demographic fluctuations and the finite lattice size . differently in the ( 3,2)-game : after the 3-species coexistence - fixed point becomes unstable , one - species fixed points become stable , so we have an extinction of all but one species already on the mean - field level for all @xmath117 , and the diffusion in the continuum homogenizes the individual fixed - point values to one and the same collective one . before this happens in the stochastic realization , first domains form with different species occupying the sites , where the one - species fixed points on the sites may differ in the surviving species , neither need the extinction events happen on all sites simultaneously .",
    "the faster the random walk on the grid , the more it resembles a strong diffusion in the space - continuum , the more homogeneous the occupation becomes , so that all sites tend to evolve to the same fixed - point value that tells us which species survives . for weaker diffusion or slower",
    "random walk , domains may coexist for a long time until a single species occupies the entire lattice . for comparison with the mean - field predictions of figure  [ ( 3,2)_array_dom ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show figure  [ ( 3,2)1d_1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) with ( c ) , respectively .",
    "patterns forming on a ( t , x)-grid are horizontal stripes , consisting of sites on which only one species dominates . on the boundaries of the stripes , sites are well mixed . with time , some of the stripes narrow and afterwards disappear , until the whole lattice is populated by only one species . as in the ( 3,1)-game , for weak diffusion",
    "no extinction of all but one species happens within @xmath119 gs , while for strong diffusion it happens after @xmath220 gs . for further details on the gillespie simulations of the ( 3,2)-game we refer to @xcite"
