    "what is the form and structure of dark matter in galactic halos ?",
    "a variety of both baryonic and non - baryonic candidates exist ( see carr 1994 for a review of baryonic dark matter candidates ) but there are relatively few constraints so the question remains .",
    "one longstanding suggestion is that of lacey & ostriker ( 1985 ) who proposed that halo dark matter consists of massive black holes with @xmath6 . in so doing",
    ", they cast a solution to two problems : 1 ) what is the composition of the dark matter ; 2 ) and what is the mechanism which heats the galactic disk ?",
    "their calculation showed that a steady flux of @xmath7 black holes passing through the disk would heat the disk in the manner required to explain the velocity dispersion - age relation @xmath8 for disk stars ( wielen 1977 ) .",
    "although subsequent observational and theoretical work suggests that an explanation of disk heating does not require massive black holes ( carlberg et al 1985 ; stromgren 1987 ; gomez et al 1990 ; lacey 1991) indeed , analysis of the disk heating problem is ongoing ( e.g. sellwood , nelson & tremaine 1998) one can , in any case , view the disk heating argument as a disk heating _",
    "constraint_. the constraint can be developed by generalizing the lacey & ostriker model to @xmath9 with a less - than - unity fraction of halo mass in black holes @xmath10 ( e.g. carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; wasserman & salpeter 1994 ) .",
    "then , since the energy input to the disk @xmath11 for a single black hole , any combination @xmath12 produces the same net heating of the disk .",
    "therefore @xmath13 overheats the disk and is definitely not allowed .",
    "the generalization @xmath10 is desirable , given the variety of dark matter candidates , the results of microlensing surveys ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) and the fact that not all dark matter need be baryonic given the bound from primordial nucelosynthesis ( pagel 1997 ) .    are there other constraints on the mass and abundance of black holes in the galactic halo ? in some sense , halo black holes are suprisingly difficult to detect , given that there is considerable observational evidence for black holes of similar mass ( @xmath14 ) in the centers of galaxies ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "conversely , they have been surprisingly difficult to constrain or rule out .",
    "lacey & ostriker themselves remarked that the accretion luminosity of such objects may be too high to have escaped detection ; however , no definitive constraint has been recorded ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; carr 1994 ) .",
    "hut & rees ( 1992 ) argued that dynamical friction would drag @xmath15 of these objects into the galactic center in a hubble time , leading to coalescence and production of a central object much larger than allowed by observational constraints ( @xmath6 ; genzel et al 1997 ) .",
    "however , xu & ostriker ( 1994 ) tested this argument with detailed n - body simulations and found that typically only one black hole would remain in the galactic center due to three - body encounters .",
    "constraints from gravitational lensing are comparatively weak at this time . for the values of @xmath16 considered in this paper ,",
    "the large size of the einstein ring gives event durations orders of magnitude too long for the present galactic microlensing surveys .",
    "lensing of quasars ( canizares 1982 ; kassiola , kovner , & blandford 1991 ) restricts @xmath17 to be less than about @xmath18 , which is greater than the estimated mass in dark haloes  an upper bound for the scenario we are considering .",
    "several observing plans have been proposed to detect massive black holes .",
    "turner and umemura ( 1997 ) argue that the sloan digital sky survery and the hubble deep field can place constraints on @xmath19 by looking for extremely large amplifications of o and g stars at cosmological distances .",
    "also , turner , wardle , & schneider ( 1990 ) propose that @xmath20 black holes are detectable through arcsecond size lensing of objects in m31 and the galactic center .",
    "wielen ( 1985,1988 ) first pointed out that globular clusters also constrain the properties of massive black holes in the galactic halo because of their susceptibility to external heating and tidal disruption .",
    "later , moore ( 1993 ) applied the same arguments to a set of low mass globular cluster in the halo .",
    "these arguments have been re - examined in more detail by klessen & burkert ( 1995 ) and arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) , who first included cluster evolution due to black hole heating in examining the constraints .",
    "our goal in this and subsequent work will be to re - examine constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath16 imposed by globular clusters using fokker - planck calculations of cluster evolution which include the effects of encounters with massive black holes .",
    "both wielen ( 1985,1988 ) and arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) delineate two mass regimes for black holes : the low @xmath16 regime , in which individual collisions perturb a cluster only weakly , but where many such collisions produce a steady , diffusive energy input ; and the high @xmath16 regime , where a single encounter can destroy the cluster . in the low - mass limit",
    ", one can obtain limits on the product @xmath21 ; in the high - mass limit , one can obtain limits only on @xmath5 for @xmath22 . applying these arguments to moore s ( 1993 ) cluster sample ,",
    "arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) concluded that @xmath23 in the low - mass regime and @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 .",
    "although arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) included evolution due to black hole heating , they did not consider the influence of internal relaxation and post - collapse evolution in their calculations .",
    "thus they pointed out the need for improved calculations to derive the most robust constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath16 using the globular cluster argument .    to address this issue in the present work , we combine the statistical framework developed by arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) with the fokker - planck evolutionary calculations employed by murali & weinberg ( 1997a - c ) .",
    "our calculations include two - body relaxation , post core - collapse evolution and tidal shocking by massive black holes .",
    "using a monte carlo approach , we focus on the high - mass regime and directly compute the probabilities for strong collisions between globular clusters and massive black holes .    in order to translate these calculations of the evolution of _ individual _ clusters into bounds on @xmath26",
    ", we need to consider the implications of our results for the evolution of a _ population _ of clusters . to accomplish this ,",
    "we adopt two different points of view .",
    "the first , and more restrictive , viewpoint is that global studies of the evolution of the globular cluster population are consistent with observations assuming _ no _ black holes at all ( e.g. murali & weinberg 1997b ) , so that including black holes should have only a minimal effect . following this approach , we find that to ensure 50% survival probability for globular clusters with masses @xmath27 at @xmath28 kpc , the fraction of the halo in black holes with masses @xmath0 must be @xmath29 .",
    "this limit on @xmath26 is between one and two orders of magnitude stronger than the disk heating constraint at this @xmath30 , and would imply that black holes with @xmath31 are not a candidate for baryonic dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "our second approach , which turns out to be systematically less restrictive , examines the evolution and stability of the globular cluster population in the context of a simple model . as we shall see , the two principal effects of perturbations by black holes are to destroy clusters outright , and to cause surviving clusters to lose mass .",
    "we model this simply via a partial differential equation that includes mass loss via an advection term , as well as destruction . in order to obtain results valid for black hole masses",
    "@xmath32 , we must extend the tidal approximation employed throughout most of this paper , so that non - destructive encounters at impact parameters inside the tidal radius of a cluster may be taken into account .",
    "( the extension of our calculations to include such penetrating encounters , as well as more detailed evolutionary models , will be treated by us elsewhere . ) in the context of these models , we find that requiring the observed mass distribution of galactic globular clusters to be stable over @xmath33 gyr requires @xmath34 at @xmath28 kpc for @xmath35 .",
    "this bound , although not as tight as our more restrictive ( and more qualitative ) limit on @xmath26 , still implies that massive black holes can not be the primary constituent of the halo dark matter .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we summarize the framework for determining constraints in  2 . in ",
    "3 we determine which globular clusters may be considered relatively unevolved over the age of the galaxy in the absence of bombardment by black holes , and then find the probability that they are destroyed for given values of @xmath16 and @xmath5 . the results are extended to different cluster and black hole parameters using scaling arguments .",
    "we then discuss the properties of clusters which are not destroyed outright , but instead undergo many non - destructive collisions over the age of the galaxy .",
    "lastly , in  4 we discuss how our results constrain @xmath16 and @xmath5 .",
    "to re - examine constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath16 set by globular clusters , we incorporate collisions and encounters with black holes into multi - mass fokker - planck calculations of cluster evolution , which include two - body relaxation and phenomenological binary heating of the core .",
    "our code descends from that of chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) . in practice , we take clusters on circular orbits at @xmath36 : this minimizes the effect of relaxation and allows us to neglect galactic tidal heating while subjecting clusters to the approximate black hole - flux crossing the disk .",
    "in addition , this radius corresponds to the spatial region containing many of the clusters in the sample used by moore ( 1993 ) .",
    "see table 1 below for a list of input parameters for the calculation .",
    "given that clusters evolve and some will vanish through evolution ( e.g. most recently murali & weinberg 1997a - c ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; vesperini 1997 ) , it is important at the outset to establish which clusters to use in setting constraints .",
    "the lifetime for given cluster orbit scales roughly with internal dynamical time @xmath37 and cluster mass @xmath38 as @xmath39 for quasistatic evolution .",
    "since @xmath37 scales with galactocentric position due to tidal limitation , low - mass clusters in the inner galaxy are the first to vanish . in general , for any particular orbit , there is a minimum mass cluster which survives to the present - day .",
    "clusters with evaporation timescales less than a hubble time @xmath40 do not provide straightforward constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath16 : clusters currently at or below the minimum mass might have had considerably larger _ initial _ mass .",
    "it is important to note that the predictions from evolutionary calculations appear quantitatively consistent with observations .",
    "the main uncertainty in the fokker - planck calculations is the core heating term : calculations predict that clusters have high central densities in the post core - collapse phase , while it is unclear precisely how this relates to observations ( e.g. drukier , fahlman & richer 1992 ) . nevertheless , the predicted death rates are not wildly inconsistent with observations and differences of opinion arise mainly over the importance of evolution in clusters at the peak of the luminosity function , @xmath41 ( murali & weinberg 1997b ; gnedin 1997 ; harris et al 1998 ; kundu et al 1998 ) .    with this in mind ,",
    "we adopt a two - step approach to investigating constraints on black hole masses : 1 ) we first determine cluster initial conditions which do not strongly evolve in smooth halos in a hubble time ; 2 ) we then immerse these clusters in halos with black holes to investigate the possible constraints . while cluster survival is most likely for large @xmath38 , significant perturbation by black holes is most likely for small @xmath38 .",
    "we consider cluster masses near the lowest @xmath38 that can survive for @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "we specify isotropic distributions of perturbing black holes using the @xmath5-@xmath16 parameterization : therefore the local number density of black holes @xmath44 .",
    "this implies the relative velocity distribution for encounters given in equation ( 16 ) of arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) .",
    "encounters between clusters and black holes are predominantly impulsive given the galactic rotation velocity @xmath45 .",
    "for a cluster at @xmath46 , the characteristic internal velocity @xmath47 . for a cluster on a circular orbit at @xmath48 and a random perturber drawn from a non - rotating , isothermal halo , the typical relative encounter velocity @xmath49 .",
    "for the black hole masses and abundances considered below , the influence of impacts at @xmath50 tidal radii , @xmath51 , is small . even at this distance ,",
    "the timescales @xmath52 so the probability of a non - impulsive encounter is very small .    to perform the simulations described below , we incorporate individual collisions between black holes and globular clusters into fokker - planck calculations using the impulse approximation . to determine the effect of each encounter",
    ", we calculate the second - order change in the distribution function ( e.g. murali & weinberg 1997a ) .",
    "the method is similar to procedures used by murali & weinberg ( 1997a ) and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) in studies of cluster evolution in the galactic tidal field .",
    "however , in the appendix , we show that there is a small error in the previous treatments . our current treatment remedies this .",
    "this approach represents a linearization of the full collision problem . in complete generality ,",
    "the collision problem requires simultaneous solution of the coupled , collisionless boltzmann - poisson equations .",
    "linearization imposes a limited range of validity . in the appendix",
    ", we show that this approach is valid for @xmath53 in a single encounter .",
    "we terminate any calculation where @xmath54 .",
    "we adopt the fokker - planck approach , rather than , say , n - body simulations because we can study evolution due to both internal and external effects and because we need a computationally feasible method to conduct the monte carlo simulations described below . while n - body simulations permit fully non - linear calculations of strong collisions , it is difficult to include two - body relaxation , core heating which leads to post core - collapse evolution and the effect of weak encounters in which only small mass loss occurs .",
    "n - body simulations are also much too expensive to use in monte carlo simulations .",
    "our analysis focuses on the _ high - mass limit _ for halo black holes ( e.g. bahcall , hut & tremaine 1980 ; wielen 1985 ; arras & wasserman 1998 ) . the limiting mass is defined as the mass for which a single , tidal encounter at the typical relative velocity can destroy a cluster . for completeness , we sketch the definition of the high - mass limit following the detailed discussion given by arras & wasserman ( 1998 ) .",
    "let us assume that cluster destruction occurs when a strong collision unbinds a fraction @xmath55 of the total mass .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the fractional mass loss in the impulsive tidal limit @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the impact parameter and relative velocity of the collision . the constant @xmath59 the quantity @xmath60 is the mean square radius of the cluster",
    ", @xmath61 is its one - dimensional central velocity dispersion and @xmath62 is a dimensionless constant depending only on its structure ; see arras & wasserman 1998 , equations ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) .",
    "note that , from the virial theorem , @xmath63 and that , by tidal limitation in an isothermal sphere , @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the galactocentric radius .    rewriting this",
    ", we may define the ` destructive radius ' : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fractional mass loss leading to destruction . given a black hole of mass @xmath16 moving at velocity @xmath58 with respect to the cluster",
    ", an encounter with any impact parameter @xmath69 leads to fractional mass loss @xmath70 from the cluster .",
    "of course , since the black hole can travel with a range of relative velocities in relation to the cluster , we may invert this relation to define the range in @xmath58 which leads to destructive encounters within @xmath51 : @xmath71 in general , cluster properties depend on time , so that @xmath72 and @xmath73 will too .",
    "we define the limiting mass @xmath74 to be the black hole mass for which @xmath75 in an encounter at @xmath76 with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the factor of 2.5 is introduced to ensure that the probability of non - destructive collisions inside @xmath51 is very small .",
    "( the factor of 2.5 is probably larger than it needs to be : we estimate a probability of about @xmath79 for a nondestructive collision inside @xmath51 when @xmath80 with this choice . ) note that @xmath81 for this value of @xmath58 , and , more generally , @xmath82 .",
    "to proceed , we introduce a framework for calculating the probability that a cluster experiences an encounter with fractional mass loss @xmath68 in a hubble time .",

    "our goal is to determine @xmath91 using realistic calculations of cluster evolution : namely the fokker - planck solutions discussed above . as mentioned above",
    ", the method is linear and valid only for @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , if we take @xmath75 , then it is most appropriate to call @xmath91 the _",
    "probability for a strong collision_. however , we also refer to @xmath91 as the disruption probability according to its original definition .",
    "since we are concerned with the probability that a cluster does or does not suffer _ one _ such collision , the range of possible final cluster states is broad : in other words , the evolution is stochastic .",
    "we therefore calculate collision probabilities using monte carlo simulations .",
    "each simulation has 60 realizations .",
    "the collision history for each realization is obtained by direct sampling of the relative velocity distribution and space density of black holes of mass @xmath16 within 10 initial tidal radii of the cluster .",
    "the disruption probability is calculated directly from the fraction of the 60 runs in which an encounter with @xmath93 occurs .",
    "initially , each cluster has mass @xmath38 , king parameter @xmath94 , galactocentric radius @xmath66 and additional parameters ( internal mass spectrum : murali & weinberg 1997b , c ) given in table [ tab : cl_params ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      our main calculations depict the evolution of king model clusters on circular orbits at @xmath96 with a range of concentration and mass .",
    "we take halos with a range of @xmath5 and @xmath80 , where @xmath97 depends on the initial concentration and mass of the cluster .",
    "figures 1 - 3 compare the results of the monte carlo calculations with the analytic predictions for the fixed cluster potential ( equation [ eq : pd_an ] ) .",
    "there appear to be statistical fluctuations in the monte carlo results as well as a small systematic trend for 15% collision probabilities to lie below the fixed cluster predictions .",
    "error bars are 68% confidence regions found using bayesian methods ( as in arras & wasserman 1998 ) and are only statistical .",
    "overall , however , the agreement is surprisingly good given that the analytic prediction neglects changes in the cluster potential due to internal evolution .",

    "although evolution should help clusters avoid strong collisions , @xmath91 is only reduced by roughly 10 - 20% for @xmath98 .",
    "agreement is best at the smallest and largest @xmath5 .",
    "agreement at @xmath99 is trivial , as @xmath100 in that limit .",
    "the agreement at larger @xmath5 , where @xmath101 , arises because the expected time to the first destructive encounter is small , so evolution ( and the resulting increase in concentration ) is relatively unimportant .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement between the analytic formulae and simlulations is surprisingly good even for intermediate values , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .      to see how cluster evolution affects @xmath91 at higher @xmath16",
    ", we repeat the above calculations for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "figure 4 shows the results .",
    "they agree well with the results for @xmath105 presented in the previous section .",
    "we conclude that evolutionary effects do not destroy the high - mass scaling derived in the fixed cluster approximation .",
    "this , in fact , is not surprising since we have restricted our attention to clusters with @xmath107 .",
    "[ fig : w5_pd_m5_r16 ]      in the above analysis , we have conservatively adopted a very large choice for @xmath97 to ensure that our calculations obey the high - mass formalism in the strictest sense .",
    "however , arras and wasserman ( 1998 ) have shown that the tidal limit formula for mass loss provides a good approximation even when @xmath109 since clusters have fairly extended , loosely bound halos . typically we expect the tidal formula to remain fairly accurate even for impacts just outside the core radius ( @xmath110 for @xmath105 ) .",
    "this approximation is worst at low concentration because the mass distribution is more extended .",
    "the approximation improves as the cluster evolves and becomes more concentrated .",
    "for example , @xmath111 encloses roughly 50% of the mass in the @xmath112 cluster and roughly 80% of the mass in the @xmath113 cluster .    for fixed @xmath86 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "thus the approximation significantly improves the limiting @xmath16 which our calculations explore .",
    "in particular , if we adopt @xmath111 , then our calculations are valid for @xmath116 . in other words",
    "the high - mass scaling obtains for @xmath117 which we have defined above .",
    "figure 5 shows the collision probabilities calculated using this approximation .",
    "the results agree well with the analytic predictions and indicate that the high - mass or destructive regime obtains down to @xmath118 .",
    "[ fig : w5_pd_m0.15625_r16.fig ]      the collision probabilities enumerated for @xmath36 can be scaled approximately to larger radius by keeping @xmath86 fixed . since @xmath119 and @xmath65 from equation ( [ eq : kdef ] ) , then @xmath86 is constant with radius for @xmath120 .",
    "the scaling is approximate because the intrinsic evolutionary rate of a cluster varies with radius due to the variation in dynamical time : @xmath121 for a tidally limited cluster in an isothermal halo .",
    "however , the above calculations fall into the regime @xmath122 , so the scaling is strong .",
    "additional calculations verify the scaling .",
    "clusters on eccentric orbits in the galaxy experience time variation in @xmath123 , the rate of destructive encounters , since the number density of black holes varies along their orbits .",
    "the galactic tidal force also varies along a cluster orbit ; this can be accounted for roughly by assuming that the cluster is tidally limited at the pericenter of its orbit .",
    "the integrated number of destructive encounters can then be written @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a measure of the eccentricity of an orbit with energy @xmath126 and angular momentum @xmath127 , and @xmath128 is the number of destructive encounters for a circular orbit with energy @xmath126 ( and angular momentum @xmath129 ) .    whether or not @xmath86 increases or decreases with increasing eccentricity depends on a competition between a higher number of encounters at smaller @xmath66 , and more time spent at large @xmath66 near apocenter . by numerical evaluation of @xmath130",
    ", we have found that @xmath131 , so that the penalty of spending more time at apocenter with the accompanied small encounter rate is the dominant factor . a convenient analytical formula for @xmath132 can by found by expanding the integral @xmath133 for small @xmath134 and integrating @xmath135 over an integral number of orbital periods  a good approximation if many orbits have been traversed . under these conditions",
    "we find @xmath136    the probability of survival is larger for clusters on eccentric orbits than for clusters on circular orbits , given @xmath126 .",
    "for example , consider two clusters with the same orbital energy , one on a circular orbit at @xmath137 kpc and a second on an eccentric orbit with pericenter at @xmath138 kpc ; in this case @xmath86 is smaller for the eccentric orbit by about a factor of two . in this case , the cluster on the eccentric orbit has a higher rate of internal evolution because of its smaller pericenter , an effect which must also be taken into account ; we discuss qualitatively in  4",
    ". finally , we note that the average value of the correction factor for an isotropic distribution of angular momenta is @xmath139 for a fairly large range of orbital energies .",
    "we examine the basic properties of the clusters which do not undergo 15% collisions .",
    "thus we describe the effect of the weaker encounters on cluster evolution .",
    "ideally we would like to determine the green s function or probability amplitude for evolution from a given initial state to a given final state ( e.g. arras & wasserman 1998 ) .",
    "of course , with 60 realizations per run and only the fraction @xmath140 not suffering strong collisions , we can only understand the distribution of final states very approximately .",
    "to do so , we simply examine the mean mass and concentration of the ` surviving ' clusters .",
    "figures 6 - 8 show the mean mass and concentration for clusters in the runs discussed above . in each case , remaining mass decreases montonically with @xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above , the black hole flux leads to both weak and strong encounters : clusters which do not suffer strong collisions still lose mass through weak encounters , so the final mass will be less than that of an isolated cluster .",
    "the evolution of concentration @xmath141 behaves somewhat differently in each case . at low mass ,",
    "the relaxation rate is enchanced by weak encounters for all initial concentrations . however , the @xmath112 clusters have not yet entered core collapse so @xmath142 increases montonically with @xmath5 . for @xmath105 and @xmath113",
    ", @xmath142 decreases with @xmath5 because the core reaches the post - collapse stage of expansion more rapidly due to the external heating .    at high mass ,",

    "@xmath142 increases with @xmath5 due to the acceleration of core evolution by external heating . for @xmath113 ,",

    "we have examined in detail how typical globular clusters evolve in a halo which contains a population of massive black holes with @xmath143 .",
    "our main goal was to establish probabilities for strong collisions between clusters and black holes in the high - mass limit using fokker - planck calculations in order to combine effects of internal relaxation , binary heating and black hole shocking .",
    "our results show that evolution does not radically alter collision probabilities determined in the fixed cluster approximation ( equation [ eq : pd_an ] ) .",
    "this result is not surprising given our approach : we first determine initial conditions which do not lead to significant evolution in the absence of black holes ; we then include black holes of some mass @xmath16 and abundance @xmath5 in calculations with these initial conditions .",

    "the differences that do arise are relatively small and therefore will not affect any conclusions we draw below .",
    "in calculating @xmath91 , we have only considered clusters on circular orbits .",
    "as discussed in  3.2.4 , clusters on eccentric orbits have lower collision probabilities .",
    "however , decreasing the pericenter also shortens the evaporation time for a cluster in isolation .",
    "for example , table 2 shows that a cluster with mass @xmath144 has an evaporation timescale of about 20 gyr assuming a circular orbit of radius @xmath137 kpc ; if its pericenter were @xmath138 kpc , its evaporation time would be about 10 gyr .",
