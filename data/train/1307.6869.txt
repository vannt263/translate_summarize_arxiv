    "a 3@xmath0 upper limit for the hdo / h@xmath12o ratio , which is less model dependent , as both lines are optically thin , is 0.175 , very close to the vienna standard mean ocean water ( vsmow ; @xmath26 ) and 103p ( @xmath27 ) values . for a @xmath28o/@xmath29o ratio of 500 ,",

    "after correcting for the uncertainties in the h@xmath12o line intensity ( table  [ table : intensities ] ) and the @xmath28o/@xmath29o isotopic ratio ( assumed to be 10% ) , our final limit for the d / h in water in comet 45p is @xmath1 ( 3@xmath0 ) .",

    "the `` snow line '' beyond which water ices could exist is at 2.7 au , in the middle of the present - day asteroid belt .",
    "this suggests that the earth accreted `` dry '' and water , and probably also organics , had to be delivered by external sources , such as comets @xcite or asteroids @xcite . in the alternative endogenous scenario ,",
    "water could survive within the snow line and the earth formed `` wet '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the d / h isotopic ratio in various solar system reservoirs provides key constraints .",
    "pre-_herschel _ measurements in oort - cloud comets indicated a d / h ratio in water twice the vsmow value of @xmath31 .",
    "jupiter - family comets , having formed further away from the sun , were expected to have even higher d / h values @xcite .",
    "comets have thus been excluded as the primary source of the earth s water .",
    "_ herschel _ provided the first measurement of the d / h ratio in a jupiter - family comet . a surprisingly low ratio of ( @xmath32 )  @xmath33 ( 1@xmath0 ) , similar to vsmow , was determined in comet 103p @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a relatively low d / h ratio of ( @xmath34 )  @xmath33 ( 1@xmath0 ) was also measured in the oort - cloud comet c/2009 p1 @xcite .",
    "these observations of comet 45p provide the second measurement of the d / h ratio in water in a jupiter - family comet .",
    "although hdo was not detected , the derived d / h ratio ( @xmath35 , 3@xmath0 ) is clearly low , possibly lower than the 103p or vsmow values  the canonical pre-_herschel _ value of @xmath2 in oort - cloud comets can be excluded at a @xmath36 level .",
    "the earlier hifi observations of comets 103p and c/2009 p1 , together with the observations of comet 45p presented here , clearly demonstrate that the high pre-_herschel _ d / h values are not representative of all comets . based on the current ( very small ) sample , the d / h ratio in jupiter - family comets appears to be lower than that in oort - cloud comets , in disagreement with the classical picture of the comet formation regions and more consistent with models with significant planetesimal interactions and movement @xcite .",
    "the grand tack model @xcite provides an attractive explanation for the observed morphology of the inner solar system and the delivery of water to the earth from the outer asteroid belt . in this model ,",
    "the earth s water is accreted during the formation phase of the terrestrial planets and not as a late veneer @xcite .",
    "this , however , appears in contradiction with the recent measurements of a distinct hydrogen isotopic ratio in lunar water , approximately twice that in the earth s oceans @xcite .",
    "these results seem to suggest that a significant delivery of cometary water to the earth - moon system occurred shortly after the moon - forming impact .",
    "the earth s water would thus be a late addition , resulting from only one , or at most a few collisions with the earth that missed the moon @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite conclude that the lunar magmatic water has an isotopic composition that is indistinguishable from the bulk water in carbonaceous chondrites , and similar to terrestrial water , demonstrating the need for additional studies .",
    "the hifi instrument provided a unique capability for measurements of the d / h ratio in cometary water . with the end of the _ herschel _ cryogenic mission on 2013 april 29 , future progress in this field",
    "will have to rely on ground - based and airborne ( e.g. , stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ) observations .",
    "the capabilities of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) for observations of cometary atmospheres were discussed by @xcite .",
    "when the band 8 receivers are completed , alma will give access to the 464 ghz ground state hdo transition , first detected in comet c/1996",
    "b2  hyakutake .",
    "comets are time variable objects that often require scheduling the observations on a short notice , however , and their emission is extended , best recorded in observations with compact alma configurations , only available for a fraction of the time .",
    "alma will thus be best suited for detailed studies of asymmetries in the outgassing of cometary volatiles and its most sensitive use for hdo detection observations in weak comets will be in the autocorrelation mode , with the 50 antennas used as single - dish telescopes .",
    "ccat is a 25-m diameter submillimeter telescope , to be built near the summit of cerro chajnantor in chile .",
    "one of the ccat first - light instruments currently under development is the chai heterodyne array that will cover the 460 ghz and 850 ghz atmospheric windows and offer exceptional capabilities for observations of hdo in cometary atmospheres .",
    "one of the main ccat science objectives will be to significantly increase the sample of comets with accurate d / h measurements and thereby allow statistical studies of the diversity of the isotopic ratio in the oort - cloud and jupiter - family comets , as well as possible correlations between the d / h ratio and chemical composition .",
    "ccat will be able to observe the 509 ghz hdo line in a typical bright oort - cloud comet ( @xmath37 s@xmath8 , @xmath38 au , @xmath39 au ) with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 14 in a 1  hr integration ( assuming frequency switching , or switching between two pixels on the chai array ) . a typical jupiter - family comet ( @xmath40 s@xmath8 , @xmath41 au ) can be detected with a s / n of 5 out to @xmath42 au in a 10  hr integration .",
    "the above computations conservatively assume a low d / h ratio equal to vsmow ",
    "higher s / n detections will be obtained for comets with enhanced d / h ratios .",
    "complementary observations of water in the ir , or uv / radio observations of oh , the photo - dissociation product of water , will be used to obtain accurate water production rates , for comparison with the ccat hdo measurements .",
    "based on long - term observing statistics , approximately one new , bright oort - cloud comet per year can be expected .",
    "in addition , a jupiter - family comet bright enough for hdo detection with ccat will be available every 23 yr .",
    "therefore , 15 hdo detections can be expected during the first 10 yr of ccat operations , which would more than double the current sample .",
    "hifi has been designed and built by a consortium of institutes and university departments from across europe , canada , and the united states ( nasa ) under the leadership of sron , netherlands institute for space research , groningen , the netherlands , and with major contributions from germany , france and the us .",
