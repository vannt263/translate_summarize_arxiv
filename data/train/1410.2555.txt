    "the broken lines correspond to the trajectories of electrons scattered by impurities , where different colors indicate electrons carrying different band indices . ]",
    "conventional superconductivity is astonishingly robust against impurity scattering .",
    "the transition temperature  @xmath2 remains approximately constant in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities as follows from the anderson theorem@xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this protection against nonmagnetic impurities is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : visualization](a ) .",
    "superconductivity occurs as a consequence of an effective attraction between electrons which is mediated by the distorted lattice , and this coupling is largest for electrons on time - reversed paths . in a disordered material , the trajectories are changed due to scattering , but the coupling remains unaffected as long as the disorder strength is weak .",
    "magnetic impurities , on the other hand , are pair breaking for conventional superconductors and suppress the transition temperature@xcite that vanishes at a critical value of the scattering rate .",
    "unconventional superconductors , in contrast , are already sensitive to nonmagnetic impurities@xcite , and again , superconductivity vanishes at a critical scattering rate .",
    "the suppression of @xmath2 with increasing scattering rate due to nonmagnetic impurities is therefore considered as a signature of unconventional superconductivity .    in iron - based superconductors , there is strong evidence supporting an @xmath1 scenario for superconductivity in these materials , where the pairing gap changes sign between different bands without breaking a point group symmetry .",
    "however , the pairing state is still under debate@xcite , and in particular the relatively weak suppression of the superconducting transition temperature with increasing concentration of nonmagnetic impurities has been used as an argument in favor of a conventional pairing state@xcite .",
    "one explanation for this behavior is that intraband and interband scattering are not equally strong in iron - based superconductors , and transport properties are mainly determined by intraband scattering effects , whereas the suppression of @xmath2 is due to interband scattering@xcite .",
    "moreover , in this paper , we show that the discrimination of @xmath0 and @xmath1  pairing state based on their response to the presence of apparently nonmagnetic impurities is not always possible .",
    "the iron - based systems are multiband superconductors in which electrons from different orbitals contribute to superconductivity and/or magnetic order .",
    "furthermore , competing states of order are a characteristic of these materials .",
    "model calculations@xcite show that imaginary charge density waves are expected to compete with antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in these materials .",
    "such imaginary charge density wave order could , similar to spin density wave order@xcite , nucleate around nonmagnetic impurities which then break time - reversal symmetry and can thereby be associated with ( orbital ) magnetism .",
    "thus , the detailed impact of orbital - magnetic impurities on pairing in these multiband systems is an interesting open topic .    in this paper",
    "we consider a two - band model for iron - based superconductors with impurities causing intraband and interband scattering processes .",
    "in contrast to previous studies@xcite which all concentrated on either nonmagnetic or spin - magnetic impurities in iron - based superconductors , we investigate how the interplay between pairing and orbital magnetism takes place . in particular , we find that impurities associated with orbital magnetism can lead to the suppression of @xmath2 in conventional superconductors which is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : visualization](b ) . scattering on such impurities involves a relative phase of  @xmath3 , and therefore the interaction matrix element between the electrons accumulates a random phase factor ( which is a multiple of @xmath3 ) that destroys superconductivity if the mean - free path becomes smaller than the superconducting coherence length . in addition , we will see that the transition temperature in unconventional superconductors may remain unaffected , i.e. , there exists an anderson theorem for the @xmath1  pairing state which is protected against time - reversal symmetry - breaking interband scattering .",
    "this protection is a result of an additional phase of  @xmath3 associated with the coupling matrix element which results in a total phase of  @xmath4 associated with every interband scattering process which is of no importance .",
    "this is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : visualization](c ) . as we will show , these effects can be due to impurities that nucleate local orbital - magnetic states .",
    "therefore , it is important for our theory that we allow for spatially extended impurity potentials .",

    "we assume that the quasiparticles in band  1 have small momenta near the center of the brillouin zone ( @xmath10 point ) , while the momenta of quasiparticles in band  2 are close to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a reciprocal primitive vector , as it is suitable for iron - based superconductors .",
    "the concrete form of the dispersion relation is not important for our calculations as long as @xmath13 holds . for simplicity",
    "we assume the density of states near the fermi level to have the same value  @xmath14 in both bands .",
    "the generalization to different densities of states in the two bands is straightforward .",
    "note that , as a consequence of assuming a constant density of states at the fermi level , our results are independent of the shape of the two fermi surfaces . in particular , the possibility of an elliptical electron fermi surface , which is important in the context of magnetic order in iron - based superconductors , is thereby included in our considerations .",
    "furthermore , we consider superconductivity ( sc ) due to interband pairing , described in a bcs - like model , @xmath15 where @xmath16 labels the band other than @xmath7 .",
    "the most generic hamiltonian of disorder in such a system reads @xmath17 where the indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 label lattice sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are vectors and matrices in spin space , respectively , i.e. , @xmath24 , where by @xmath25 we denote field operators in position space which have to be understood as convolution with momenta in band  @xmath7 only .",

    "@xmath29 are the matrix elements of a nondiagonal matrix in position space , allowing us to describe spatially extended scattering centers , which is essential , e.g. , to account for orbital - magnetic impurities .    at the same time , in what follows , we assume for simplicity that the disorder is short correlated on the scale @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the largest of the fermi wave vectors in the two bands .",
    "before we explicitly calculate the effect of impurities on the sc  transition temperature of @xmath0 and @xmath1  superconductors , we will provide an extension of anderson s theorem@xcite for two - band superconductors .",
    "specifically , it will be demonstrated that the @xmath0  pairing state is robust against time - reversal - symmetric ( trs ) scattering while for the @xmath1  pairing state , the gap is unchanged by time - reversal - antisymmetric ( tra ) interband and trs intraband disorder",
    ". furthermore , we present a criterion for the protection of density waves in the presence of disorder .",

    "the mean - field hamiltonian   with a homogeneous order parameter  @xmath36 can be applied to a disordered system provided the disorder strength is sufficiently weak@xcite , so that electron states near the fermi surface are delocalized in the normal metal phase ( @xmath37 ) or the localization length is large , @xmath38 where @xmath2 is the critical temperature of the superconductive transition . throughout the paper",

    "we start by considering trs disorder , i.e. , we assume @xmath67 but @xmath68 in eq .  .",

    "the spectrum of @xmath58 can straightforwardly be found from the condition @xmath69 where for a pure @xmath0  pairing state , @xmath70 and @xmath71 holds in addition .",
    "then the commutator @xmath72 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\delta_-\\left[\\hat{w}^+,\\hat{\\tau}_3\\right ]   \\label{commutator}\\ ] ] vanishes , and we can use eq .   for the evaluation of the determinant .",
    "we obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath58 in the case of trs disorder in an @xmath0  superconductor , @xmath73 where @xmath74 denote the different real eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , the gap of the disordered system is larger than or equal to @xmath76 , the gap of the clean system .",
    "we have hereby shown that the gap will be unaffected by the presence of the disorder potential which indicates the stability of the @xmath0  superconducting state against trs impurity scattering , and thus obtained the anderson theorem for @xmath0  superconductors .",
    "we note that the commutator   also vanishes for @xmath77 if the disorder potential is purely band diagonal , i.e. , no interband scattering processes occur . therefore , from similar reasoning",
    ", we obtain that the @xmath1  pairing state is protected against nonmagnetic intraband scattering .",
    "the same approach can be used to motivate an analog of the anderson theorem for the @xmath1  pairing state .",
    "we rewrite the determinant by performing a unimodular transformation in bandspace , @xmath78 for the specific microscopic scattering mechanism to be discussed below , that is , for a purely band diagonal trs component and a purely band off - diagonal tra component of the disorder potential , it follows : @xmath79 and , hence , we have to solve @xmath80 from the analysis of sec .

    "this is the algebraic reason for why the @xmath0 superconductor is in general prone to tra scattering , while the @xmath1 state is stable against tra interband disorder and trs intraband disorder .",
    "let us finally emphasize that this conclusion holds irrespective of the form of the bands ( as long as @xmath84 holds ) and the detailed momentum dependence of @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the disorder potential does not have to be momentum independent within each band for the @xmath1 anderson theorem to hold .",
    "furthermore , it does not rely on the disorder potential breaking time - reversal symmetry due to spin or orbital magnetism .",
    "it is only important that @xmath85 holds . here",
    "the insensitivity to spin results from the investigation of singlet pairing .",
    "criteria for the stability against a specific class of impurities , analogous to the anderson theorem for superconductivity , can be derived for particle - hole instabilities as well .",

    "however , our arguments can be extended to the case of small deviations from perfect particle - hole symmetry but then we have to assume an order parameter large enough to ensure a fully gapped fermi surface .",
    "again , we consider an arbitrary but fixed disorder realization as given in eq .  .",
    "the full mean - field hamiltonian can be written compactly as @xmath93 with @xmath94 the condition under which the gap of the density wave will not be reduced in the presence of impurities is @xmath95 and hence the density wave is stable against impurities satisfying the criterion  . the proof is presented in appendix  [ app : anderson - dw ] .    in the remainder",
    "we apply this result to our model for the iron - based superconductors , where real spin density wave order ( sdw ) is competing with superconductivity , i.e. , we consider @xmath96 . in general ,",

    ".    in conclusion , impurities that are invariant under time - reversal are not able to generate nontrivial phases in the scattering matrix elements such that a nontrivial phase can arise .",
    "since we are not concentrating on spin magnetism , this implies that a nontrivial phase is caused by orbital magnetism in multiband superconductors .",
    "the renormalization group analysis  @xcite of the two - band hubbard model with particle - hole symmetry , as suited for the description of iron - based superconductors , revealed the existence of a fixed point where the hamiltonian exhibits an so(6 ) symmetry , and three different states of order compete@xcite .",
    "for repulsive interband interactions , these ordered states are spin density waves ( sdw ) with a real order parameter @xmath218 @xmath1  superconductivity ( sc ) with order parameter @xmath219 and charge density waves ( icdw ) with an imaginary order parameter @xmath220 associated with orbital magnetism .",
    "thus , at this fixed point , the free energy  @xmath221 is a function of a combined order parameter , @xmath222 .",
    "since iron - based superconductors are only close to this so(6)-symmetric fixed point , the sdw or sc instabilities occur first , and icdw  order has not been observed in any iron - based superconductor so far , although being close in energy .",

    "such icdw - type impurities break time - reversal symmetry and thereby are responsible for orbital magnetism .",
    "thus we consider such icdw  impurities as an example to demonstrate the emergence of a nontrivial phase in the impurity line in iron - based superconductors . since @xmath223 is an ising order parameter , it can nucleate with either sign around a given impurity site .",

    "@xmath18 can , for example , be restricted to nearest neighbors  ( nn ) . in momentum space ,",
    "the corresponding matrix element is given by @xmath226{~ , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus the scattering rate is given by @xmath227 hence , even if impurities at different sites were to exhibit a different sign of the loop - current ising order parameter , the scattering rate would be unaffected because it only depends on the order parameter squared .",
    "for the interband scattering process corresponding to the exchange of two electrons between the bands , @xmath228 , it holds that @xmath229 . the interband scattering process from which a phase in the impurity line might arise is associated with @xmath230 and corresponds to a cooper pair being scattered to the other band , that is , @xmath231 .",
    "all other combinations of band indices yield @xmath232 , reflecting that this particular type of impurities can only cause certain interband scattering processes .",
    "keeping in mind that a global prefactor of @xmath233 corresponds to a phase of @xmath3 , we evaluate the imaginary part of the impurity line that might yield arbitrary phases .",

    "as long as inversion symmetry is present in the crystal , the imaginary part of the impurity line is zero .",
    "however , phases of @xmath235 and @xmath3 are possible even in case of an inversion - symmetric lattice .",
    "for example , in case of zero incoming momenta , @xmath236 , and outgoing momenta @xmath237 , @xmath238 , an inversion - symmetric lattice , and short - ranged impurities that only affect neighboring sites , we find a phase of @xmath3 since @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "when , additionally , the lattice breaks inversion symmetry , even arbitrary phases are conceivable , also leading to suppression of @xmath2 , but with a different functional behavior .",
    "we consider a two - band superconductor in the presence of impurities . depending on the interaction leading to superconductivity ,",
    "this model describes conventional or unconventional superconductivity which is known to react differently to the presence of impurities , also depending on whether the impurities are sensitive to the spin of the scattered electrons or not .",
    "extended potential impurities , although insensitive to spin , can still break time - reversal symmetry , and in this paper we consider the effect of such impurities associated with orbital magnetism on the transition temperature .",
    "one example for the occurrence of this effect could be a competing state of order nucleated by the impurity .",
    "such a scenario is conceivable in the case of iron - based superconductors , where imaginary charge density waves are a hidden state of order competing with superconductivity .",
    "orbital magnetism , that as competing ordered state nucleates near impurities , manifests itself in a nontrivial phase in the impurity line of one interband scattering process , and we classify different limits by this phase .",
    "our results for the transition temperature are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : suppression ] .",
    "the trivial phase @xmath185 corresponds to the well - known situation : the transition temperature  @xmath2 of conventional superconductors remains unaffected by impurities , whereas for unconventional superconductors , @xmath2 is suppressed with increasing interband scattering rate , and even vanishes completely at a critical scattering rate .",
    "the functional behavior of @xmath2 on the interband scattering rate corresponds to the functional behavior originally only associated with paramagnetic impurities by abrikosov and gorkov . for a phase of @xmath187 , however , we find the reversed situation .",
    "then , impurities are pair breaking for conventional superconductors with the same functional behavior , and there exists an analog of the anderson theorem for unconventional superconductors .",
    "this scenario is indeed realized in case of the imaginary charge density wave state discussed in refs .  .",
    "since the phase  @xmath145 in the impurity line is only defined relative to a similar phase in the bcs coupling matrix element  @xmath147 , this result can also be understood in terms of a redefinition of the electron operators in order to absorb the phase of the impurity line associated with the scattering process with rate @xmath198 , @xmath241 this leaves the intraband scattering processes as well as the interband scattering process associated with rate  @xmath242 unaffected , but entails a simultaneous rescaling of the bcs  coupling matrix element @xmath243 . in the case of @xmath187",
    "this corresponds to @xmath244 , and thus , an attractive interaction under this transformation effectively becoming repulsive , and vice versa . therefore",

    "pair breaking due to interband scattering does not only occur in unconventional superconductors , and the robustness of @xmath2 against impurities does not necessarily imply conventional superconductivity .",
    "additionally , we give a condition under which spin density waves as they occur in iron - based superconductors are also protected against impurities .",
    "we find that spin density waves are stable against the impurities associated with orbital magnetism that we considered as an example in sec .",
