    "strong x - ray emission from luminous elliptical galaxies is clear evidence that the hot interstellar gas they contain is losing energy . throughout most of the galactic volume",
    ", this loss of energy does not result in lower temperatures since the gas is continuously reheated by compression in the galactic gravitational potential as it slowly moves inward . in this sense the galactic `` cooling flow '' is a misnomer .",
    "ultimately , however , in the central regions of the flow the gas density becomes large enough for radiative losses to overwhelm dynamical compression and the gas cools catastrophically . for a typical galactic cooling rate , @xmath0 @xmath1 per year ,",
    "the total amount of gas that cools in a massive elliptical over a hubble time is large , several @xmath16 @xmath1 , a few percent of the total stellar mass .",
    "remarkably , the amount of cold gas observed in ellipticals , either in atomic or molecular form , is many orders of magnitude less than @xmath16 @xmath1 ( bregman , hogg & roberts 1992 ) .",
    "the mass of central black holes in bright ellipticals is also relatively small , typically less than a few @xmath17 @xmath1 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , so the cooled gas can not be in the holes .",
    "soft x - ray absorption has been observed in some galactic cooling flows , indicating masses of cold gas comparable to the predicted value , but the quantitative significance or reality of this absorption is unclear at present .",
    "in addition to cold gas deposited by cooling flows , it is possible that additional cold , dusty gas is occasionally delivered to the centers of ellipticals as a result of merging with gas - rich companion galaxies . while this is plausible for some gas - rich ellipticals having dusty clouds or lanes , if merging were an important source of cold gas for all massive ellipticals , the merging rate would need to be carefully regulated in order to maintain the small amount of cold gas observed in normal ellipticals .    for many years",
    "the standard theoretical explanation for this shortage of cooled gas is that it has been consumed in forming low mass stars ( e.g. fabian , nulsen & canizares 1982 ; thomas 1986 ; cowie & binney 1988 ; ferland , fabian , & johnstone 1994 ) .",
    "such young stars must have low masses since neither luminous ob stars nor type ii supernovae have been observed in normal ellipticals . explaining the disappearance of cooled gas by invoking the poorly understood physics of star formation may seem contrived and the low stellar mass hypothesis has led to some ridicule .",
    "the fate of cooled gas in cooling flows associated with clusters of galaxies has received most of the observational and theoretical attention because of the spectacularly large inferred mass deposition rates , @xmath18 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "in addition to low mass stars , the apparent soft x - ray intrinsic absorption of @xmath19 @xmath20 indicates that @xmath3 @xmath1 of cold gas lies within @xmath21 kpc of the cluster cores .",
    "although enormous , this amount of gas would still be only a few percent of the total cooled gas based on the estimated @xmath22 , so low mass stars are still the preferred endstate for most of the cooled cluster gas ( allen & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "however , as with elliptical galaxies , this amount of cold gas should in general be detectable in hi or co emission but has not ( odea et al .",
    "1994 ; ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ; vogt & donahue 1995 ; puy , grenacher , & jetzer 1999 ) , amounting to a colossal discrepancy between expectation and reality .    in the discussion that follows we revisit the problem of cooled gas from the perspective of the galactic cooling flow in ngc 4472 , a large , well - observed elliptical galaxy .",
    "for relatively nearby ellipticals the threshold for radio detection is much lower and the ratio of observed to predicted cold gas masses is similar to that of more distant cluster cooling flows ; e.g. h@xmath23 and hi are undetected in ngc 4472 with an upper limit @xmath24 @xmath1 ( bregman , roberts & giovanelli 1988 ; braine , henkel & wiklind 1988 ) , far below the @xmath3 @xmath1 expected",
    ". nevertheless , the intrinsic soft x - ray absorbing column in ngc 4472 , @xmath25 @xmath20 , and its relatively large covering factor indicates cool gas masses far in excess of the radio upper limit .",
    "the cooling flow in ngc 4472 clearly suffers from a miniature version of the same cooling flow problems of distant cluster flows .",
    "but because of its proximity , there is a large available body of additional observational information for ngc 4472 that make it a more appropriate venue to resolve or constrain theoretical possibilities for the fate of cooled gas .",
    "but the main advantage afforded by large , relatively nearby ellipticals emphasized here is that the cooled gas is heated , ionized and therefore _ illuminated _ by ultraviolet radiation from highly evolved galactic stars .",
    "we argue that the diffuse optical line emission from hii gas at @xmath26 k distributed across the central regions of most or all bright ellipticals is a direct tracer of cooled gas deposited by the hot interstellar gas .",
    "a simple analysis of this hii gas leads to the conclusion that hot phase gas is not cooling into a single large cloud of neutral gas , but is cooling at a large number ( @xmath6 ) of cooling sites located throughout the central regions of ngc 4472 .",
    "the hii gas provides direct observational support for a distributed mass dropout that has been assumed by many authors in the past based on their interpretation of x - ray surface brightness profiles ( e.g. thomas 1986 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "as the mass of hii increases at each cooling site , a neutral core of very low temperature ( @xmath27 k ) eventually develops .",
    "we show that these neutral cores are very weakly ionized and can undergo gravitational collapse even in the presence of maximum strength magnetic fields .",
    "evidently this collapse results in local star formation .    another important conclusion from our study of the ionized gas in ngc 4472 is that only a very small amount , @xmath0 @xmath1 , of neutral ( or molecular ) gas can accumulate at each cooling site before it undergoes gravitational collapse .",
    "the small mass of collapsing neutral cores is an essential requirement for low mass star formation .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ) have shown that the gas temperature and jeans mass are small deep within hi or h@xmath23 gas irradiated by x - rays in cluster cooling flows , but this does not guarantee that massive stars can not form .",
    "for example , the jeans mass is often very low in galactic molecular clouds but these clouds are also the birthsites for massive ob stars .",
    "the limited mass of cold gas at each cooling site in ngc 4472 and other similar ellipticals naturally prohibits stars more massive than about 1 @xmath1 from forming .",
    "the low mass star formation process we propose is also very efficient : the total mass of cold gas at all cooling sites in ngc 4472 at any time is very small , consistent with observed upper limit of cold gas ( @xmath28 @xmath1 ) .",
    "ngc 4472 is an excellent galaxy for studying this unique star formation process since very little alien gas or stars have been recently accreted into ngc 4472 by a merging process .",
    "dusty , and therefore accreted , gas is confined to within @xmath29 ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ; ferrari et al .",
    "1999 )    a final advantage of studying cooled gas in ellipticals like ngc 4472 is that the neutral gas formed in the cores of hii regions with temperatures @xmath30 k , only lasts for a time , @xmath31 years , that is too short for dust ( and possibly many molecules ) to form .",
    "although dust and molecules are not required for low mass star formation to proceed , these components have complicated previous discussions of cooling flows in clusters of galaxies where , we assume , the cooling process resembles that in ngc 4472 .",
    "one shortcoming of our presentation  as with those of previous authors  is that we can not reconcile the observed soft x - ray absorption in ngc 4472 with the small amount of cold gas indicated by null observations of hi and co emission .",
    "we assume , without much justification , that these contradictory observations will be resolved in favor of the radio observations and that the soft x - ray absorption can be interpreted in another way .",
    "hii gas in elliptical galaxies can also arise from stellar mass loss which is ionized by hot central stars ( planetary nebulae ) and galactic uv radiation .",
    "we begin our discussion below with an argument that cooling flow dropout , not stellar mass loss , is likely to be the main contributor to internally - produced hii gas mass observed in nearby ellipticals .",
    "then we discuss an elementary model for the hii gas at a typical interstellar cooling site and infer from this a low global filling factor for hii gas within the central region of ngc 4472 .",
    "next we model the cooling of hot gas from @xmath32 to @xmath33 k with a subsonic flow in pressure equilibrium  this flow is useful in estimating the possible contribution of cooling gas to the x - ray absorption .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the temperature , ionization level and gravitational instability of neutral cores at the centers of hii cooling site clouds .",
    "this part of our presentation follows rather closely several previous discussions , but serves to illustrate that the more spatially concentrated radiative transfer in spherical geometry still allows low temperatures and low mass star formation within these cores .",
    "we then show from observational considerations that magnetic fields play little or no role in inhibiting the compression of interstellar gas as it cools from @xmath24 to @xmath34 k and from theoretical considerations that even the strongest observationally allowed magnetic fields are unlikely to inhibit the final collapse of neutral cores to stellar densities . at the end of our presentation",
    "we discuss the effects of galactic gravitational forces and stellar collisions on cooling site clouds . finally , to stimulate further observations of optical emission lines , we present a surface brightness map of ngc 4472 showing all the major components : stars , x - ray emitting gas , and hii gas from interstellar dropout and stellar ejecta .",
    "for quantitative estimates in the following discussion , we use a specific galaxy , ngc 4472 , a massive e2 galaxy associated with the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4472 has been extensively observed at x - ray frequencies with _",
    "hri ( trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ) and with rosat hri and pspc ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "the radial variations of hot gas density and temperature based on these x - ray data are illustrated in brighenti & mathews ( 1997a ) .",
    "although the outer region of the x - ray image of ngc 4472 is distorted , possibly by ram pressure interaction with ambient virgo gas , the azimuthally averaged radial variation of electron density in ngc 4472 is typical of other bright ellipticals ( mathews & brighenti 1998 ) .",
    "the most likely region for low mass star formation in ngc 4472 is the volume within @xmath35 where @xmath36 kpc is the effective or half - light radius at a distance of 17 mpc .",
    "the gas that cools in ngc 4472 can not all collect at the origin , nor is it likely that most of the cooling occurs at very large galactic radii where the radiative cooling rate ( @xmath37 ) is inefficient .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( 1999a ) have shown that if all the cooled gas accumulates at or near the very center of the galaxy , @xmath38 pc , the remaining uncooled hot gas there is locally compressed and becomes very hot , but this is not observed . alternatively ,",
    "if most of the cooling and low mass star formation occurs in @xmath39 , then the extremely close agreement between the total mass inferred from x - ray data and the known stellar mass in this region would be upset ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) .",
    "finally , there is good evidence from observed gas abundance and temperature gradients that hot interstellar gas is flowing inward within @xmath40 through the optically bright regions of ngc 4472 ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) , so it is unlikely that a significant number of low mass stars could form at @xmath41 .",
    "it is most interesting therefore that hii optical line emission in h@xmath42 + [ nii ] lines is observed just in the region of ngc 4472 where low mass star formation is most expected , @xmath43 ( macchetto et al .",
    "in addition to interstellar gas cooling from the hot phase , cold gas is continuously expelled from stars throughout the galaxy as a result of normal stellar evolution . the total rate that mass is supplied by a population of old stars in ngc 4472",
    "is @xmath44 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 where @xmath45 @xmath1 is the stellar mass in ngc 4472 and @xmath46 yr@xmath8 is the specific mass loss rate from a single burst of star formation after @xmath47 gyrs ( mathews 1989 ) .",
    "the supply of gas from stars is comparable to the rate that gas is observed to cool from the hot phase : @xmath48 yr@xmath8 , where @xmath49 is the proton mass and @xmath50 ergs s@xmath8 is the bolometric x - ray luminosity of ngc 4472 at a distance of 17 mpc .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that most of the gas lost from stars in ellipticals is dissipatively and conductively heated and rapidly merges with the general hot interstellar cooling flow .",
    "gas lost from orbiting stars inherits stellar velocities which , when dissipated in shocks or by thermal conductivity , equilibrates to the virial temperature of the stellar system , @xmath51 kev .",
    "however , the stellar virial temperature is about 30 percent lower than that of the more extensive dark halo . as cooling flow gas slowly flows inward from the halo into the stellar region , it is cooled by @xmath52 kev as it mixes with slightly cooler virialized gas ejected from local stars ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) .",
    "this produces the positive temperature gradients observed within a few @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , the iron , silicon and other elements supplied by the stars increases the metal abundance in the hot interstellar gas as it slowly flows toward the galactic center within @xmath54 , producing negative abundance gradients ( matsushita 1997 ) .",
    "these observations indicate that most or all of the gas ejected by stars merges with the hot gas phase . for simplicity , in the following discussion we ignore the hii contribution from stellar mass loss , but return to this question in  11 .",
    "this is contrary to the hypothesis of thomas ( 1986 ) that gas ejected from stars remains largely neutral and collapses into ( very ) low mass stars without joining the hot phase .",
    "the assimilation of stellar ejecta into the hot interstellar gas is greatly accelerated by dynamical and thermal processes resulting from the orbital motion of mass - losing stars through the cooling flow ( mathews 1990 ) .",
    "rayleigh - taylor and other instabilities shred the ejected gas into many tiny cloudlets , greatly increasing the surface area presented to the hot cooling flow gas and their rapid dissipation by conductive heating . in addition , neutral clumps of gas expelled from stars always have ionized outer layers which are easily ablated and reformed ; this results in a rapid and complete disruptive heating of the clump .",
    "in contrast , cold gas produced as gas cools directly from the hot interstellar phase is necessarily formed in the local rest frame of the cooling flow gas so the violent dynamical instabilities that accompany stellar mass loss are not expected .",
    "after @xmath6 years , however , the denser cooling region may begin to fall in the galactic gravitational field ( see  10 ) , possibly leading to some disruption at the cloud boundary ( malagoli et al .",
    "1990 ; hattori & habe 1990 ) . assuming that radiative cooling from the hot interstellar phase occurs , as gas cools through hii temperatures it is thermally protected by surrounding gas at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath55 k ) where the thermal conductivity is very low .",
    "the global kinematics of the two hii gas components of internal origin are quite different .",
    "hii regions produced by stellar ejecta will initially tend to mimic local random and systematic stellar motions while hii gas arising from cooling gas will initially share the velocity of local hot gas .",
    "a third source of hii gas in ellipticals are the ionized parts of gas acquired in recent merging events such as the small dusty clouds within @xmath56 of the center of ngc 4472 ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",
    "this gas is spatially disorganized and is dynamically unrelaxed .",
    "dust is another clue of its external origin since gas formed by cooling from the hot phase should be nearly dust - free due to sputtering ( draine & salpeter 1979 ; tsai & mathews 1995 ; 1996 ) and may not have time to grow dust in the gas phase (  7 ) .",
    "our interest here is with the hii component produced as gas cools from the hot phase and we assume that this component dominates the optical line emission in ngc 4472 .",
    "a small cloud of hii gas that has cooled from the hot interstellar medium is photoionized by stellar uv radiation arriving at its outer boundary ; this is the inverse geometry of normal hii regions ionized by a central star .",
    "we suppose that the hii cloud is spherical and that the electron density @xmath57 and temperature @xmath58 k are uniform throughout the hii gas .",
    "the spatial uniformity of the hii density is essentially unaffected by small local gravitational fields due to internal stars , the neutral core in the cloud if one exists , or the hii gas itself .",
    "the mass of these hii clouds located at the centers of local cooling sites slowly increases with time . the first step in understanding",
    "the evolution of hii clouds is to determine the maximum size and mass that can be ionized by stellar uv in the central regions of ngc 4472 .",
    "this size depends on the hii electron density and the mean intensity of galactic uv starlight @xmath59 .",
    "the intensity of ionizing radiation can be determined by an appropriate integral over the galactic stellar distribution . for this",
    "we assume a de vaucouleurs stellar distribution similar to that in ngc 4472 , with an effective radius of @xmath36 kpc and an outer maximum stellar radius of 25@xmath53 .",
    "the stellar density and mass are given to a good approximation by @xmath60\\ ] ] and @xmath61^{1/4})\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the incomplete gamma function ( mellier & mathez 1987 ) .",
    "if the de vaucouleurs distribution extends to infinity , the total mass would be @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "it is natural to normalize the density coefficient @xmath66 to fit the de vaucouleurs distribution for ngc 4472 in the region @xmath67 where the x - ray and stellar mass determinations agree , i.e. @xmath68 gm/@xmath69 .",
    "when the stellar distribution is truncated at @xmath70 the total mass @xmath71 @xmath1 is only about 1 percent less than an infinite stellar distribution having the same @xmath66 .    at every radius @xmath72 in the de vaucouleurs distribution",
    "the mean stellar column density @xmath73 can be found by integrating over solid angle , @xmath74 here @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the distance back along a ray at angle @xmath77 extending through the de vaucouleurs stellar distribution @xmath78 .",
    "the mean column density @xmath79 ( in @xmath1 of stellar matter @xmath20 ster@xmath8 ) is calculated using the exact solution for the mass intensity along each ray and averaging over solid angle with 192 gaussian divisions . then @xmath79 is converted into an approximate mean intensity of ionizing photons @xmath80 by using the conversion factor @xmath81 ionizing photons per second per solar mass of old stars ( binette et al . 1994 ; brighenti & mathews 1997b ) : @xmath82 the local density of ionizing photons is then @xmath83 .",
    "a plot of @xmath84 and @xmath80 in ngc 4472 is shown in figure 1 ; the variation of @xmath80 ( dashed line ) and therefore @xmath85 is much flatter than the stellar density @xmath78 ( solid line ) .    the electron density in hii clouds @xmath86 can be found from @xmath87 where @xmath88 k and @xmath89 is the pressure of the hot ism that reproduces the x - ray observations of ngc 4472 .",
    "plots of @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be found in brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) .    the stromgren condition for the maximum radius @xmath92 of a spherical",

    "this is equivalent to @xmath98 which is reasonable .",
    "the stromgren radius is then @xmath99 the density of hii gas is @xmath100 where @xmath101 , assuming @xmath102 for the molecular weight .",
    "the total mass of the stromgren sphere is @xmath103 where @xmath49 is the proton mass .",
    "some imprecision is expected since we have ignored those ionizing photons that pass through the hii cloud unabsorbed .",
    "however , calculations of the transfer of ionizing radiation in the inverse hii region indicate that equation ( 1 ) is accurate to @xmath104 percent .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the radial variation of electron density @xmath105 in hii gas ( solid line ) with galactic radius in ngc 4472 and the corresponding local inverse stromgren radius @xmath92 ( long dashed line ) . within the radius where h@xmath42 is observed in ngc 4472 ,",
    "@xmath106 we find @xmath107 pc , @xmath108 @xmath109 , and the mass of a typical stromgren cloud is @xmath110 @xmath1 .",
    "the radial column density in an hii stromgren cloud is typically @xmath111 @xmath20 .",
    "hot gas is assumed to be cooling at numerous sites throughout this central region of ngc 4472 and the cooling is made visible by optical line emission from the hii regions .",
    "the mass of any particular hii cloud increases slowly with time , supplied by local cooling from the hot gas phase or by dissipative merging of clouds . presumably , new hii clouds are continuously forming from the cooling interstellar gas at newly - formed cooling sites and old sites and associated clouds are disappearing .",
    "but we suppose that the mean age of cooling sites is long compared to the time required for typical hii clouds to reach the stromgren mass ; in this case the average cloud can be approximated with stromgren parameters .",
    "notice also that @xmath112 so that even the largest hii clouds are very small compared to their distance to the center of the galaxy .",
    "we propose that most of the extended balmer line emission in ellipticals arises from a multitude of hii clouds at or near their stromgren radii .",
    "if so , the total volume within clouds occupies only a tiny fraction @xmath113 of the galactic volume within the h@xmath42-emitting region of ngc 4472 , @xmath114 kpc .",
    "the filling factor @xmath113 can be estimated by comparing the total volume of hii required to produce the observed balmer line luminosity to the apparent volume from which optical line emission is observed .",
    "in most optical observations , such as those of macchetto et al ( 1996 ) , h@xmath42 ( 6562  ) is blended with two nearby [ nii ] lines at 6584 and 6548  .",

    "therefore , about @xmath126 stromgren clouds are required to account for the balmer line luminosity observed .",
    "the hii filling factor is found by comparing the volume of all hii gas @xmath127 @xmath69 ( assuming @xmath128 @xmath109 ) with the total volume of the h@xmath14-emitting region , @xmath129 @xmath109 .",
    "the filling factor of hii gas @xmath130 is very small , consistent with our proposition that hii emission arises from many small clouds and with earlier estimates of @xmath113 ( baum 1992 ) .",
    "if @xmath0 @xmath1 of hot gas cools each year in ngc 4472 , then the mass of each cloud will grow quite slowly , @xmath131",

    "the total mass of all the hii emitting gas in ngc 4472 is @xmath133 @xmath1 , similar to values in the literature but here evaluated using a consistent physical model .",
    "a small filling factor also implies that each hii cloud is exposed to the unabsorbed stellar uv emission from the entire galaxy , provided the cloud system is approximately spherical .",

    "combining previous results , the average column depth that hii gas presents to x - radiation throughout the galactic core , @xmath140 @xmath20 , is much less than the value @xmath141 @xmath20 that best fits the observed x - ray continuum ( buote 1999 ) .",
    "the size that an hii cloud presents to absorbing x - rays is larger than @xmath92 since we have ignored the extended cooling region around each cloud with temperatures between @xmath142 and @xmath34 k in which x - rays can still be absorbed .",

    "the total mass of hi or h@xmath23 gas observed in the central regions of ngc 4472 , @xmath143 @xmath1 , is another potential source of x - ray absorption .",
    "if this mass of cold gas were arranged in a disk of thickness of the x - ray absorbing column @xmath144 @xmath20 , located in the galactic core and oriented with its symmetry axis along the line of sight , it would have a radius @xmath145 pc , somewhat larger than the faint patch of dust observed by van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) . however a cloud of size 370 pc obscures only @xmath146 of the total x - ray luminosity of ngc 4472 and would therefore produce negligible x - ray absorption .",
    "the true x - ray absorption is very probably much less than @xmath147 @xmath20 .",
    "the observation of ngc 4472 by buote using the @xmath148 beam of asca also included the nearby gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxy ugc 7636 ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ; irwin , frayer & sarazin 1997 ) which may be the source of the x - ray absorbing column attributed to ngc 4472 if its covering factor is sufficiently large .",
    "although it seems likely that interstellar magnetic fields are important in the centers of ellipticals ( mathews & brighenti 1997 ; godon , soker & white 1998 ) , it is remarkable that the observed optical line emission does not indicate strong fields in the hii gas .",
    "typical hii densities in bright ellipticals determined from [ sii ] 6716/6731 line ratios are @xmath149 @xmath109 ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; donahue & voit 1997 ) , similar to ( or even a bit larger than ) the values found here for ngc 4472 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "( unfortunately , we have been unable to find a determination of the hii density specific to ngc 4472 . )",
    "this suggests that the hii gas density is not being diluted by magnetic support , i.e. @xmath150 or @xmath151 g in the hii gas .",
    "hii densities of @xmath21 are also supported by comparing the ionization parameter @xmath152 for pressure equilibrium hii gas in ngc 4472 ( short dashed line in figure 2 ) with values that characterize the entire observed line spectrum . within @xmath54 in ngc 4472 @xmath153 , very similar to values of @xmath154 required to reproduce liner type spectrum typically observed in ellipticals ( e.g. johnstone & fabian 1988 ) ; this provides an independent check on our hii gas density and @xmath155 near the center of ngc 4472 .",
    "the apparent absence of magnetic support in the hii gas is interesting since the hot phase gas is required to have fields of at least several @xmath156 g at large galactic radii to explain faraday depolarization of radio sources and distant quasars ( garrington & conway 1991 ) .",
    "interstellar fields @xmath157 g can be generated in a natural way by stellar seed fields and turbulent dynamo action in the hot gas ( mathews & brighenti 1997 ) .",
    "as the gas density increases by @xmath158 when it cools from the hot phase to hii temperatures , a field of 1 @xmath156 g would grow to 100 @xmath156 g if flux is conserved , @xmath159 .",
    "the initial field in the hot gas in @xmath43 would need to be surprisingly small , @xmath160 g , to evolve into the rather small fields allowed in hii clouds , @xmath161 g , implied by typical electron densities .",
    "small hii fields can be understood if local cooling sites form in interstellar regions having lower than average fields ; in pressure balance , lower fields require higher hot gas densities which cool preferentially . alternatively ,",
    "it is possible that field reconnection has been very efficient during cooling , implying a disorganized field and considerable stirring motion during the cooling process .",
    "cooling sites in the hot interstellar gas are initiated in regions of low entropy ( i.e. low temperature , high density ) which cool preferentially by radiative losses .",
    "entropy fluctuations can be generated by a variety of complex events : stellar mass loss , occasional type ia supernovae , sporadic mergers with other nearby ( dwarf ) galaxies , and differential snii heating events and outflows that occurred in pregalactic condensations . due to the complicated nature of these interactions",
    ", it is difficult to predict the amplitudes and mass scales of the entropy inhomogeneities so the detailed nature of the initial cooling process remains unclear .",
    "however , once cooling commences , the gas flow toward the cooling site may evolve toward a simple profile provided entropy fluctuations in the hot gas are not too severe over the flow region .",
    "we now describe such a model for cooling site flow into an individual hii cloud in which the flow is largely subsonic and little influenced by magnetic stresses . in the subsonic limit we can assume that the flow is isobaric .",
    "the thermal energy equation is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the constant pressure of the ambient hot gas , @xmath164 is the specific thermal energy , and @xmath165 is the raymond - cox cooling coefficient which must be accompanied by the factor @xmath166 .",
    "the corresponding temperature evolution is @xmath167 if the converging flow at a cooling site is regular over times @xmath168 years , then steady state is a good approximation , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 describes the velocity of a fluid element .",
    "the spatial variation of gas temperature in the cooling site flow is found by dividing the equations above : @xmath171 we solve this equation by integrating outward from the boundary of a stromgren cloud of typical radius @xmath172 pc and temperature @xmath58 k assuming a uniform pressure typical of the inner galaxy , @xmath173 dynes .",
    "once @xmath174 is known , the density and flow velocity can be found from the remaining equations .",
    "cooling site flows for @xmath175 and @xmath176 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the flow is subsonic at every radius .",
    "when @xmath165 is slowly varying , the temperature varies approximately linearly with radius , @xmath177 .",
    "these simple solutions indicate that the cooling region in which @xmath178 k is at most about twice the stromgren radius so the extended cooling region can only increase the soft x - ray crossection of each cloud by @xmath179 , not enough to account for the indicated soft x - ray absorption .",
    "we do not consider conductive heating and thermal disruption of cooling site flows by ambient hot gas since this would be incompatible with our basic assumption that the hot interstellar gas is cooling over a large galactic volume .",
    "however , once a cooling site is formed , it can not be easily reversed by thermal conductivity . the hii cloud that forms at the center of a cooling site",
    "is surrounded by a protective sheath of gas at intermediate temperatures in which the thermal conductivity is extremely low ( @xmath180 ) even in the absence of magnetic fields . by comparison , gas expelled from evolving red giant stars",
    "is directly exposed to interstellar gas at @xmath2 k , greatly enhancing the likelihood of conductive dissipation of that gas .",
    "finally , thermal conductivity is much less important in galactic cooling flows than in hotter cluster cooling flows .",
    "the soft x - ray emission from the cooling region shown in figure 3 is enhanced by the larger density but suppressed by the lower mean temperature in the flow .",
    "for the flows in figure 3 the x - ray intensity in the rosat band ( 0.2 - 2.5 kev ) at @xmath181 ( ignoring absorption in the hii cloud ) is increased by @xmath182 compared to the same emission from non - cooling interstellar gas if it occupied the same volume as the flow . however , since the volume of the cooling site flow is tiny compared to the entire galaxy , the mean x - ray intensity incident on the hi core is not sensibly increased by emission from the surrounding cooling site flow . nor is external x - radiation incident on the hii cloud appreciably absorbed within the cooling site flow .",
    "as an hii cloud grows in mass at a cooling site , its radius must eventually exceed the stromgren value , causing a neutral or molecular core to develop at its center .",
    "as the cloud and core mass increase further , the core will become unstable to gravitational collapse if the gas there is sufficiently cold .",
    "we shall determine the core mass at which collapse first occurs and thus determine an upper limit to the mass of stars that can form . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the core is primarily atomic hydrogen .",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility and implications of gas - phase dust formation and growth in cooled gas in cluster cooling flows ( daines , fabian & thomas 1994 ; fabian et al .",
    "1994 ; voit & donahue 1995 ) . however , dust may not have time to form or grow in ngc 4472 because of the insufficient available time . for a lower limit to the dust formation time consider assembling graphite grains with carbon atoms that stick with every collision and ignoring carbon atom depletion from the gas phase",

    "k ( see below ) the grain formation time is @xmath191 years .",
    "since this minimum value for @xmath192 is comparable to the lifetime @xmath193 yrs of neutral or molecular cores ( see  8 below ) , it is unlikely that much dust can form .",
    "in addition , molecules can not form in gas phase interactions without grains ( herbst 1987 ) .",
    "formation of h@xmath23 via the h@xmath194 ion is also problematic in galactic cooling flows because of the high probability of h@xmath194 photodetachment by galactic starlight .",
    "we shall not consider these details here .    an essential assumption in estimating the mass of neutral cores is that the accumulation of gas in cooling site clouds is slow compared to the free fall time in the neutral core .",
    "if neutral gas accumulates faster than it can collapse under self - gravity , then more massive and luminous stars can form , contrary to observation .",
    "since @xmath195 hii clouds are collectively processing the entire cooling rate of the galaxy , about @xmath196 @xmath1 flows into each cloud per year .",
    "neutral cores of density @xmath197 are in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding hii and ambient hot interstellar gas , @xmath198 , ignoring factors of order unity involving molecular weights . near the center of ngc 4472",
    "the hot gas pressure is @xmath199 k @xmath109 so the gas density in the neutral cores , @xmath200 is large , similar to star - forming cores in galactic molecular clouds .",
    "if the cores become gravitationally unstable , they collapse in @xmath201 years .",
    "since the typical cloud takes a longer time @xmath202 to form , the required slowness seems to be guaranteed , but not by a wide margin .",
    "as the masses of molecular cores slowly increase , they must eventually become gravitationally unstable and form into stars .",
    "the condition for this to occur can be estimated using the virial theorem with surface pressure , @xmath203 where @xmath204 dynes is the ambient interstellar pressure near the center of ngc 4472 .",
    "although the temperature and density within the cold core are expected to develop radial gradients due to gravity forces , in this simple virial model the temperature and density within the hi core are uniform , but the core pressure is enhanced by self - gravitation .",
    "magnetic forces and rotation are ignored .",

    "since the mass of each hii cloud increases slowly compared to the free fall time of the neutral core , the core mass will not increase further as it collapses .",

    "fragmentation into a salpeter imf ( from 0.03 to 4.5 @xmath1 ) during collapse would limit the typical maximum stellar mass to @xmath11 @xmath1 ( i.e. a5v to f0v ) .",

    "may reflect the influence of lower interstellar pressure in equation ( 5 ) and correspondingly larger unstable core masses .",
    "for a definitive understanding of star formation in elliptical galaxies or elsewhere , it is necessary to consider the influence of magnetic fields and rotation , both of which are intensified during the two major compressions that lead to gravitational instability and star formation in elliptical galaxies .    during the initial cooling condensation from @xmath353 to @xmath34 k ,",
    "neither rotation nor magnetic energy density appear to have strongly restricted the collapse .",
    "any fragmentation due to rotation during this initial cooling phase probably serves only to increase the multitude of local cooling sites , each containing a small hii region .",
    "remarkably , the frozen - in amplification of magnetic energy during this initial compression has not occurred since optical observations indicate that the hii gas pressure equals the pressure of the local hot interstellar gas and is therefore undiluted by additional magnetic support .",
    "the second cooling compression by another factor of @xmath354 occurs as the core gas recombines and the temperature falls from @xmath34 k to @xmath182 k. during this compression , magnetic fields will intensify if they remain attached to the weakly ionized plasma and rotation should also increase .",
    "rotation during this final stage may lead to subsequent fragmentation into even smaller masses , although the entire cloud is optically thick in the main cooling lines . a helpful interplay between magnetic breaking and angular momentum redistribution",
    "can be expected as stellar densities are approached . in this section",
    "we discuss a limited aspect of this general problem , the loss of magnetic stresses by reconnection and ambipolar diffusion as neutral gas recombines and compresses to typical hi core densities , @xmath15 @xmath109 .",
    "although difficult to prove rigorously , reconnection losses could in principle greatly reduce magnetic stresses and their inhibiting influence on compression .",
    "we have already noted that the observed hii gas pressure in bright ellipticals restricts fields in the hii gas to @xmath355 @xmath156 g , suggesting that some reconnection losses occurred during compression from local interstellar to hii densities .",
    "reconnection could be stimulated by turbulence and disordered fields expected in the hot interstellar gas ( mathews & brighenti 1997 ) which , when compacted to hii densities , result in locally anti - directed fields . in the second compression phase , as hii gas condenses into hi cores , the density increases by another factor of 1000 and the final flux - frozen fields would then be @xmath356 @xmath156 g .",
    "fields this large in the hi core would strongly inhibit gravitational instability and star formation and increase the minimum core mass necessary for gravitational collapse . however , it is possible that reconnection losses also dominate this second cooling phase if the field is sufficiently disordered ( friaca & jafelice 1998 ) .",
    "if reconnection is wonderfully efficient , the field - free estimates we have made here for the maximum unstable stellar mass do not require further modification .",
    "fortunately , physical conditions in hi cores allow for efficient slippage of the magnetic field relative to the neutral gas . for densities and field strengths of interest here , the charged - neutral collision rate is much less than the larmor frequency for both ions and electrons , so ambipolar diffusion should prevail over ohmic dissipation or hall effect ( wardle & ng 1999 ) .",
    "as the field moves relative to the ( essentially stationary ) neutral component in hi cores , ion - neutral drag must balance magnetic tension , @xmath357 here @xmath358 is the momentum transfer cross - section . when @xmath359 is less than some transition velocity @xmath360 ,",

    ", the drift velocity @xmath359 is either linear or quadratic . for collisions in weakly ionized hydrogen , the transition velocity @xmath366 km s@xmath8",
    "is found by equating the two crossections .",
    "the time required for a field to leak through a weakly ionized neutral core @xmath367 in the linear regime is @xmath368 where @xmath369 is the degree of ionization .    to illustrate the efficiency of ambipolar diffusion in collapsing hi cores we can exploit the result that larger fields diffuse out faster , i.e. @xmath370 .",
    "we begin by considering two simple limits : ( 1 ) initially uncompressed neutral gas that is supported by magnetic stresses and ( 2 ) dense neutral gas after it has collapsed to core densities approaching gravitational instability . for the initial state , consider a gas which has become largely neutral , but is supported by a field of maximum strength , @xmath371 g , so that its density @xmath372 @xmath109 is still that of the hii gas . as long as @xmath373 the column density in such a core of mass @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 still resembles that of typical hi cores in figure 6 , so @xmath10 . under these circumstances",
    "the ambipolar diffusion time is @xmath374 @xmath375 this time is much less than the free fall time for field - free cores , @xmath376 yrs , so the strongest possible initial fields can not arrest the initial compression toward typical hi core densities .",
    "after the hi gas compresses to the final core density but just before gravitational collapse occurs , then @xmath377 @xmath109 and a magnetic field @xmath378 g is comparable with the gas pressure . in this final state before core collapse , the ambipolar diffusion time @xmath379 @xmath380 is now longer than the core freefall time , @xmath15 yrs or the dynamical time @xmath6 yrs desired to process cold gas rapidly into stars , involving observationally small hi and co masses . some additional field losses by reconnection may be required .",
    "however , this estimate of the field diffusion time in the final core fails to acknowledge that field diffusion occurs steadily during the collapse to core densities .",
    "suppose for example that the field varies as if it were frozen - in , @xmath381 , then the ratio of field diffusion to free fall time at each density during the collapse varies as @xmath382 which increases only modestly as @xmath86 increases by @xmath158 , holding @xmath305 approximately constant .",
    "( we use the linear drift regime , which generally applies . )",
    "if this time scale ratio is normalized to the initial time ratio above , @xmath383 , then @xmath384 when core densities are reached , which remains much less than unity . in the absence of a detailed calculation ,",
    "this crude estimate suggests that magnetic fields can slip away from hi cores rapidly compared to the dynamical times involved in the gravitational evolution of hi cores .    when field diffusion is important , however , the field is spatially redistributed , not destroyed . in a rigorous calculation",
    "it would be necessary to follow the subsequent evolution of the field which may accumulate in the outer regions of the core .",
    "if left behind after star formation , such magnetically enhanced regions may ultimately become buoyant in the galactic field and merge again with the hii gas .",
    "in addition , the thermal balance in the neutral gas will be altered by heating due to field diffusion and reconnection , but this heat may be carried away by efficient radiative losses . in summary , it appears that magnetic stresses may not be an overwhelming problem in restricting neutral cores from gravitational collapse .",
    "how magnetic and rotation effects influence the subsequent history of the star after collapse ensues will not be entered into here .",
    "because of their high density relative to the hot interstellar gas , hi - hii clouds will tend to fall in the gravitational field of the galaxy past the hot gas .",
    "as an hi - hii cloud falls toward the center of the galaxy , the hii envelope should experience a drag force , so some motion of the hi core away from the center of the hii envelope could be expected . for a conservative estimate of this ,",
    "suppose that the hi core is accelerated toward the center of the galaxy by the galactic gravitational force but the galactic position of the hii envelope is held fixed .",
    "at a galactic radius of @xmath385 , the gravitational acceleration toward the galactic center is @xmath386 cm / s@xmath387 where @xmath388 @xmath1 at @xmath385 .",
    "( if the cooling flow is rotating , this acceleration will be an overestimate . ) the time required for the hi core to move a distance equal to its own diameter ( @xmath389 pc ) , @xmath390 yrs , exceeds the recombination time in the hii gas , @xmath391 years . even in this extreme example which maximizes the differential motion of hii and hi ,",
    "gas can exchange between the hi and hii phases rapidly enough to maintain the neutral core near the center of the cloud .    how many galactic stars are momentarily passing through hii clouds or their cold cores at any time ? from figure 1 the stellar density at @xmath392 is @xmath393 gm @xmath109 or @xmath394 @xmath1 pc@xmath395 .",

    "supernovae are not expected to greatly disturb cooling site clouds .",
    "optical line emission in ellipticals identifies where hot interstellar gas is cooling and forming into low mass stars . in this section",
    "we estimate the h@xmath14 surface brightness in ngc 4472 due to emission from cooled hot interstellar gas .",
    "we use a dropout procedure that is self - consistent , but not necessarily unique .",
    "one of the least understood but essential components in evolutionary models for the hot interstellar gas is the cooling dropout mass profile .",
    "the notion of distributed cooling mass dropout was first invoked in steady state cooling flow calculations to reduce the central x - ray surface brightness peak to better fit the observations ( thomas 1986 ; thomas et al .",
    "1986 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ; bertin & toniazzo 1996 ) . in our recent galactic cooling flow models",
    "we compare the effect of distributed mass dropout on both the apparent ( observed ) temperature and electron density distributions .",
    "dropout reduces the apparent temperature and increases the apparent density .",
    "however , we find that it is the dropout contribution to the mass to light ratio ( dynamically determined from stellar velocities ) that most strongly constrains cooling dropout mass profiles ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) .",
    "one of the simplest dropout assumptions that adequately satisfies these constraints is the recipe employed by sarazin & ashe ( 1989 ) ; we use it here to illustrate the relationship between optical line emission and mass dropout .",
    "following sarazin & ashe ( 1989 ) , we suppose that the hot gas cools at a rate @xmath402 that depends on the local hot gas density and the cooling time at constant pressure , @xmath403 . here",
    "@xmath404 is the hot phase temperature and @xmath405 is a constant factor that characterizes the cooling rate .",
    "assuming that the @xmath406 of low mass stars is very large , we find that @xmath407 satisfies reasonably well most of the observational constraints for ngc 4472 ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) . we suppose that most of the cooling gas is processed through mature cooling sites where the typical hii cloud mass is comparable to the local stromgren mass @xmath408 . at each cooling site mass",
    "is processed into low mass stars at a rate @xmath409 where @xmath410 yrs , based on the filling factor argument . by continuity , the total rate that cooling mass passes through an element of galactic volume @xmath411 is @xmath412 where @xmath413 is the number of @xmath344stromgren clouds in @xmath411 .",
    "each stromgren cloud has an h@xmath14 luminosity @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the electron density of gas at @xmath88 k and @xmath416 is the case b h@xmath14 emissivity .",
    "the mean global h@xmath14 emissivity at radius @xmath272 due to dropout cooling is therefore @xmath417 notice that @xmath418 is independent of the mean cloud mass @xmath408 but depends on the time @xmath419 for low mass stars to form at each cooling site .",
    "the h@xmath14 surface brightness @xmath420 for this dropout model is found by integrating @xmath418 along the line of sight through the galaxy at projected radius @xmath421 .    for comparison",
    ", we also estimate the h@xmath14 surface brightness distribution from gas recently ejected from evolving stars and ionized by galactic ultraviolet radiation .",
    "ejected envelopes from red giant stars are not sufficiently massive to produce clouds of stromgren mass .",
    "the ejection process is complex and slow , lasting @xmath15 years .",
    "in addition , mass - losing stars orbit rapidly through the hot gas .",
    "this results in violent rayleigh - taylor disruption in @xmath33 years as the ejected gas is decelerated and shocked by the hot interstellar gas .",
    "the huge surface area that the highly fragmented stellar ejecta presents to the hot gas promotes the conductive assimilation of this hii gas into the local hot gas on timescale @xmath422 yrs ( mathews 1990 ) .",
    "the assimilation time @xmath423 depends on the density of the local interstellar gas , the mean velocity of mass - losing stars , and other parameters . in estimating the h@xmath14 emissivity from stellar ejecta we assume that these complications can be subsumed into the single parameter @xmath423 which we regard as spatially uniform .",
    "the rate of supply of mass from evolving stars is proportional to the local stellar density , @xmath424 , where @xmath425 sec@xmath8 is appropriate for a salpeter type imf .",
    "the local mean h@xmath14 emissivity due to stellar ejecta is therefore @xmath426 where @xmath415 since pressure equilibrium is reached on very short timescales .    in figure 8",
    "we illustrate the x - ray surface brightness @xmath427 of ngc 4472 in the rosat energy band ( 0.2 - 2.0 kev ) computed from the combined density and temperature distributions @xmath332 and @xmath174 determined from _ einstein _ , rosat , and asca data ( see brighenti & mathews 1997a for details ) .",
    "using these same @xmath332 and @xmath174 profiles , we have determined the h@xmath14 emissivity from equation ( 9 ) and plot the corresponding surface brightness @xmath428(dropout ) in figure 8 , assuming a sarazin - ashe dropout coefficient @xmath407 .",
    "@xmath428(dropout ) is normalized so that the total h@xmath14 luminosity within @xmath429 matches the observed value @xmath430 erg s@xmath8 from this region ; with this normalization the total h@xmath14 luminosity from the entire galaxy is somewhat larger : @xmath431 erg s@xmath8 . to achieve this normalization",
    "it is gratifying that the characteristic star formation time in equation ( 9 ) must be @xmath432 years , very close to the value discussed earlier when @xmath407 .",
    "this value of @xmath419 normalized to @xmath433 is a consequence of our assumption that most h@xmath14 line emission comes from dropout , any additional hii contribution from stellar mass loss would tend to increase @xmath419 .",
    "we also plot in figure 8 the stellar surface brightness @xmath434 for ngc 4472 using the standard de vaucouleurs relation @xmath435 \\}\\ ] ] which agrees very well with the ccd photometry of ngc 4472 by peletier et al .",
    "the h@xmath14 surface brightness profile @xmath436 from gas recently ejected from stars using equation ( 10 ) is also shown in figure 8 with two assimilation times , @xmath437 ( preferred ) and @xmath438 yrs .",
    "these estimates for @xmath436 , although very uncertain , are less than @xmath428(dropout ) , indicating that most of the h@xmath14 observed in ngc 4472 is related to mass dropout not stellar mass loss .",
    "this conclusion is not inconsistent with the observation of a few bright , young planetary nebulae in ellipticals ionized by central stars ( e.g. arnaboldi , freeman & gerhard 1998 ) .",
    "a considerable amount of observational data is available on the radial distribution and kinematics of optical line emission in normal ellipticals ( trinchieri & di serego alighieri 1991 ; macchetto et al .",

    "1997 ; trinchieri , noris & di serego alighieri 1997 ; goudfrooij & trinchieri 1998 ; corsini et al . 1999 ) , but additional observations of optical emission line spectra and surface brightness distributions would be useful in understanding the physics of mass dropout from the hot interstellar gas .",
    "models for the evolution of hot interstellar gas in ellipticals that are successful in most other respects  such as explaining the observed radial distribution of hot gas density , temperature and abundance  can not be fully accepted unless they can also account for the final disposition of cooled gas .",
    "recent evolutionary models for the hot gas in ngc 4472 require that a mass @xmath439 @xmath1 must cool in some fashion over the hubble time ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) .",
    "there are two serious problems in discharging this cold gas from the cooling flow : ( 1 ) although @xmath440 is much less than the total stellar mass @xmath441 @xmath1 , the mass of cooled gas must be deposited within the ( inner ) galaxy in a manner consistent with the known stellar mass to light ratio , and ( 2 ) the cooling process and the conversion of cooled gas into low mass stars or some optically dark equivalent must be supported with a physically plausible model  this is the problem we address here .",
    "our objective in this paper is to further our understanding of mass dropout by exploiting features unique to elliptical galaxy cooling flows that are generally unavailable or less obvious in cluster cooling flows .",
    "foremost among the advantages in galactic flows is that the the dropout is illuminated by stellar uv ionizing radiation , appearing as hii emission visible throughout the inner galaxy . by this",
    "means we assert that the cooling must be widespread , distributed among many cooling sites . moreover , the cooling rate at each site is sufficiently slow that hii clouds there can develop neutral cores that undergo gravitational collapse after only @xmath11 @xmath1 of neutral gas has accumulated .",
    "only low mass stars can form .",
    "the conversion of hot gas into low mass stars in galactic cooling flows is very efficient , with star - formation timescales so short , @xmath15 years , that dust and probably molecules can not form .",
    "globally , this cooling dropout model involves very little mass of neutral gas at any time , @xmath442 @xmath1 and satisfies the low upper limits on observed hi + h@xmath23 gas in ngc 4472 ( @xmath28 @xmath1 ) .    in a similar investigation",
    "several years ago , ferland , fabian & johnstone ( 1994 ) studied the thermal structure of cold clouds directly illuminated by x - rays from cluster cooling flow gas .",
    "specifically , they solved the plane parallel transfer of @xmath443 kev thermal radiation into a cold , non - magnetic , dust - free slab , including a large number of coolants and chemical reactions .",
    "they showed that deep within the irradiated slab , @xmath444 @xmath20 , the gas becomes molecular and the temperature falls below 10 k where the jeans mass is only a few tenths of a solar mass , implying that low mass stars are likely to form .",
    "our study here is a complementary extension of this idea , including several additional considerations .",
    "we consider fewer atomic and chemical processes than the ferland , fabian & johnston ( 1994 ) calculation , but many complicated processes involving dust and molecules may be irrelevant in galactic cooling flows due to the short lifetime of the cooled gas before collapsing to stellar densities .",
    "we have shown that the more concentrated spherical radiative transfer of x - rays into cooling sites with star - forming neutral cores does not increase the core gas temperature appreciably . unlike the plane parallel calculation , where jeans unstable regions could in principle merge to form more massive stars , in our spherical model the _ total _ mass of gas in the cold cores prior to gravitational collapse ",
    "@xmath1  absolutely precludes the formation of massive stars which are never observed in normal ellipticals .",
    "the simple model proposed here is unlikely to apply to every elliptical galaxy . unlike massive ellipticals like ngc 4472 ,",
    "the stellar systems in low luminosity ellipticals ( @xmath445 ) differ in many important details : they are rotationally supported , have more nearly isotropic stellar velocities , have dense power - law stellar cusps , are disky , etc .",
    "( faber et al . 1997 ) .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) have shown that large , rotationally supported cold gaseous disks can form in these low luminosity ellipticals and that normal , luminous star formation in the disk may account for the systematically higher stellar h@xmath14 indices observed in these galaxies ( de jong & davies 1997 , although their correlation with h@xmath14 has been challenged by rampazzo et al .",
    "recent hi observations of low luminosity ellipticals have detected smooth , differentially rotating disks of hi gas in these galaxies , sometimes extending right to the center ( oosterloo , morganti , & sadler 1998 ) similar to the cold disks predicted by our models .",
    "evidently , star formation in large , coherent hi disks in low mass ellipticals differs from the model described here in which the hi gas is distributed among many isolated , physically distinct clouds .",
    "small irregular dusty clouds are observed in the cores of most ( @xmath446 percent ) bright ellipticals ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .",
    "centrally orbiting hii gas is also occasionally observed , sometimes rotating in a sense opposite to that of the galaxy ( e.g. bertola , buson & zeilinger 1988 ) . in these cases gas",
    "has presumably been acquired by a merging process unrelated to cooling flow evolution .",
    "since the dusty clouds typically have masses in excess of the critical masses for gravitational collapse @xmath0 @xmath1 , luminous massive star formation with a normal imf can be expected as well as type ii supernovae , but at very low rates .",
    "normalizing to our galaxy where there are @xmath447 snii yr@xmath8 per solar mass of molecular interstellar gas , the @xmath28 @xmath1 of cold gas in ngc 4472 should generate @xmath448 snii yr@xmath8 . because this snii rate is so small ( and their light is masked by starlight in the galactic core ) , it is not surprising that snii have escaped detection in ellipticals .",
    "optical luminosity and h@xmath14 emission from normal star formation in dusty cores is also deeply buried in starlight . according to the data of tacconi & young ( 1986 ) ,",
    "the disk of the scd galaxy ngc 6946 produces @xmath449 ergs s@xmath8 of b - band light per solar mass of h@xmath23 gas so the @xmath450 @xmath1 of cold gas in ngc 4472 should generate @xmath451 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the dusty gas cloud in ngc 4472 has a maximum extent of only @xmath452 arcseconds ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) which is less than the `` break '' radius @xmath453 in the stellar light . assuming the b - band surface brightness in ngc 4472 is uniform within @xmath454 , the total projected luminosity produced by galactic stars , @xmath455 erg s@xmath8 , exceeds @xmath456 .",
    "we conclude that normal stellar formation can occur in accreted dusty clouds at the centers of bright ellipticals like ngc 4472 without easy detection .",
    "the interesting possibility of observing cold gas in elliptical galaxies with the 6.4 kev fluorescent fe line has been discussed by churazov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . however , the small star - forming regions discussed here are completely transparent to k shell ionizing radiation at 7 kev ( see figure 4 ) so very little 6.4 kev radiation would be expected . in any case ,",
    "galactic cooling flows of temperature @xmath0 kev have little emission above 7 kev .",
    "perhaps the best confirmation of our star formation model would be to directly observe the young , low mass stars and a variety of infrared techniques are available for this purpose ( kroupa & gilmore 1994 ; joy et al .",
    "1995 ; prestwich et al . 1997 ) .",
    "our conclusions can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "the final stages of catastrophic cooling in galactic cooling flows is distributed among a large number of cooling sites , each occupying a tiny fraction of the galactic volume .",
    "the mass of cold gas within hii clouds at each site accumulates slowly , allowing episodic gravitational collapse of dense neutral cores . in the typical interstellar environment of giant elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the maximum mass of gravitationally unstable regions is only @xmath342 @xmath1 ( i.e. later than a5v ) , setting an absolute upper limit on the mass of stars that can form .",
    "some optical luminosity would be produced by these stars even if the collapsing cores fragmented with a normal imf . magnetic stresses and rotation could complicate this conclusion , but simple estimates indicate that magnetic fields diffuse rapidly out of collapsing , star - forming cores .",
    "this method of forming low mass stars involves very little neutral or molecular gas and is completely consistent with the apparent absence of cold gas in normal ellipticals  assuming that the mass of cold gas is more accurately determined from radio than from x - ray observations .",
    "if cooling from hot interstellar gas occurs at large galactic radii , near @xmath53 , then stars of larger mass @xmath457 @xmath1 can form .",
    "such stars may help produce the h@xmath14 absorption features observed in elliptical galaxies which have been interpreted as evidence for a population of youthful stars of intermediate mass .",
    "finally , in elliptical galaxies the star - forming sites are illuminated by optical hii line emission so the surface brightness of this radiation must be in accord with mass dropout models as well as with observations of the hot x - ray emitting interstellar gas .",

    "<S> thermal x - ray emission from cooling flows in elliptical galaxies indicates that @xmath0 @xmath1 of hot ( @xmath2 k ) interstellar gas cools each year , accumulating @xmath3 @xmath1 over a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> paradoxically , optical and radio frequency emission from the cooled gas is lacking , indicating that less than @xmath4 of the cooled gas remains . </S>",
    "<S> many have speculated that the cooled gas has formed into relatively invisible low mass stars , particularly in the context of massive cooling flows in galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on cooling flows in elliptical galaxies like ngc 4472 where the cooled gas is made visible in emission lines from hii regions ionized and heated ( @xmath5 k ) by stellar ultraviolet radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the low filling factor of hii gas requires that the hot gas cools at @xmath6 cooling sites within several kpc of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> hii mass slowly increases at each site at @xmath7 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 until a neutral core develops . </S>",
    "<S> neutral cores are heated ( @xmath9 k ) and ionized ( @xmath10 ) by thermal x - rays from the entire interstellar cooling flow . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the _ maximum _ mass of spherical hi cores that become gravitationally unstable is only @xmath11 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> no star can exceed this mass and fragmentation of collapsing cores produces stars of even lower mass . by this </S>",
    "<S> means we establish with some confidence that the hypothesis of low mass star formation is indeed correct  </S>",
    "<S> the imf is bottom heavy , but may be optically luminous </S>",
    "<S> . slightly more massive stars @xmath12 @xmath1 can form near the effective radius ( @xmath13 kpc in ngc 4472 ) if sufficient masses of interstellar gas cool there , producing a luminous population of intermediate mass stars perhaps with radial orbits that may contribute to the stellar h@xmath14 index . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of ionization in gravitationally collapsing cores is sufficiently low to allow magnetic fields to disconnect by ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> low mass star formation is very efficient , involving @xmath6 @xmath1 of galactic cold gas at any time , in agreement with observed upper limits on cold gas mass . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the cooling region surrounding a typical cooling site and show that the total x - ray absorption in cold and cooling gas is much less that that indicated by recent x - ray observations . using a mass dropout scheme consistent with x - ray observations and dynamical mass to light ratios , we plot the global h@xmath14 surface brightness profile in ngc 4472 and compare it with the smaller contribution from hii gas recently ejected from red giant stars . the lifetime of cooled gas at each cooling site , @xmath15 yrs , is too short to permit dust formation and perhaps also gas phase formation of molecules .    </S>",
