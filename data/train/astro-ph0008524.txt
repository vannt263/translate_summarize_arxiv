    "sa galaxies are the earliest hubble types exhibiting clear evidence of spiral structure .",
    "but while the small pitch angle of the arms in sa s is distinctive , tightly wound spirals show a wide range of bulge size and current star formation rate , the other two criteria used to distinguish among the spiral types . thus , the sa class is heterogeneous , including gas - rich and gas - poor disks and large and small  bulged systems .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to their later spiral counterparts , sa s typically occupy higher density environments and require little or no dark matter within their optical disks .",
    "the origin of the heterogeneity of the sa class has been the focus of a detailed study of the morphology , environment , kinematics and dynamics of a sample of nearby , undisturbed and relatively isolated sa galaxies .",
    "band optical imaging observations provide luminosity profiles , colors and measures of morphological asymmetry in the stellar distribution .",
    "long  slit spectroscopy along both the major and minor axes provide details of the kinematics of both stellar and ionized gas components . narrow ",
    "band h@xmath0 imaging identifies the sites of current massive star formation , while hi synthesis imaging provides measures of both morphological and dynamical asymmetry in the gas disk and details of the dynamics which can be used to trace the mass .",

    "jore _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) presented results for the surprising case of ngc  4138 , the first sa we studied , specifically chosen for its relative isolation and morphological `` boring''ness .",
    "ngc  4138 is a smooth , undisturbed , small - bulged sa , classified by the small pitch angle of its arms .",
    "an outlying member of the ursa major cluster , its nearest neighbor lies more than 9 times further than the observed hi extent . as evident in figure 1 , the hi gas is extended , with r@xmath1/r@xmath2 = 2.2 , and the hi surface density is very low throughout .",
    "the hi rotation curve can be traced to 16 disk scale lengths , and while the _ observed _ hi rotation curve declines by 80 km  s@xmath3 beyond the optical edge , a significant warp is evident from the bending of the minor axis velocity contours , making the derivation of the mass distribution ambiguous .",
    "nonetheless , at least 50% of the total mass within the optical radius is dark .",
    "most curiously , however , all of the gas , as traced both by the hi and the optical emission lines , counterrotates with respect to the primary stellar component ; a secondary stellar population , kinematically coupled to the gas , is also visible .",
    "the amplitude of the cross - correlation function of the stellar lines coincides spatially with an h@xmath0 ring , previously noticed by pogge & eskridge  ( 1987 ) and also shown in figure 1 , at a radius of @xmath4 20 .",
    "the two stellar components are characterized by distinct velocity dispersions , implying separate origins .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) showed that the extended counter ",
    "rotating component might be the result either of the accretion of a gas  rich dwarf or retrograde primordial gas infall .",
    "of the overall sample of 20 sa galaxies studied by jore ( 1997 ) , nearly half show some spectroscopic evidence of kinematic peculiarity .",
    "the degree and circumstances of the distinct kinematics vary from complete counterrotation of all of the gas from all / most of the stars ( ngc  3626 , ngc  4138 ) to nuclear gas disks decoupled from the stars ( ngc  5854 ) to anomalous velocity central gas components ( ngc  3623 , ngc  3900 , ngc  4772 ) .",
    "the hi distribution in nine sa s was mapped with the vla , and of those , all but ngc  3623 , known to be a member of the interacting leo triplet , show r@xmath1/r@xmath5 2 .",
    "rings are prominent features in both the optical light and in the distributions of ionized and neutral gas .",
    "while the hi velocity fields are dominated by circular rotation , the hi disks are significantly warped . in general ,",
    "the hi surface density is very low and the outer hi is patchy and asymmetric ( ngc  3900 , ngc  4138 ) or found in a distinct ring , exterior to the optical edge ( ngc  3626 , ngc  4772 , ngc  5448 ) .",
    "while the overall hi velocity fields are dominated by circular motions , warps are suggested in the outer regions by bending of the minor axis isovelocity contours ( ngc  1169 , ngc  4138 ) and/or systematic shifts in position angle of the inner and outer rings ( ngc  3626 , ngc  4772 ) . in the eight cases where the hi is extended ,",
    "significant dark matter halos are required ; in the other case ( ngc  3623 ) , the mass of the halo can not be constrained by the detected rotation curve .",
    "kornreich _ et al .",
    "_   ( 2000 )",
    "apply quantitative measures of morphological and dynamical asymmetry to the hi synthesis maps . while the stellar light distribution is axisymmetric",
    ", significant deviations from symmetry were found in both the hi morphology and dynamics .",
    "the complex kinematics seen in both the the optical long  slit spectroscopic data and the hi velocity fields is also evident in the warping of the hi disks . with the exception of the kinematically - normal sba ngc  1169 , none of these galaxies shows the simple warping behavior seen in the briggs ( 1990 ) sample .",
    "rather , the warping observed in most of the sa galaxies is more complex and of order 15@xmath6 , as predicted by the simulations of minor mergers presented by quinn _",
    "et al . _   ( 1993 ) and hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) .    while sa s tend to be found in higher density environments",
    ", it may be very important that the present sample consists principally of relatively isolated , unbarred and undisturbed sa galaxies .",
    "although all show tightly wound arms , they span a range of bulge  to  disk ratios ( b / d ) .",
    "et al . _   ( 1995 ) have concluded that the observed tendency of galaxies to have greater b / d in higher density regions is simply reflective of morphological segregation . to try to see",
    "if b / d might correlate with environment _ within the sa class _ , we have applied the 2-d decomposition scheme of moriondo _ et al . _   ( 1998 ) to derive @xmath7 band b / d for a nearly - complete sample of northern sa s fitting a generalized exponential to the bulge light , @xmath8,$ ] where @xmath9 is the shape index . in on - going work ,",
    "we find marginal evidence that sa s with close neighbors show a larger range of b / d than ones with no near neighbors ( hagemann 2000 ) and that @xmath9 may vary with environment .    while the current sample is small and consists of relatively isolated objects , their optical morphology bears no hint of the disturbances responsible for the complex kinematics evident in half the galaxies .",
    "thus , minor mergers may play an important role in producing the heterogeneity of the sa class through the triggering of starbursts , bulge  building or the dislocation of disk gas , but the evidence of such minor events is quickly lost from the morphological appearance of the stellar distribution as evident in optical images .",
    "morphological criteria alone thus may seriously underestimate the rate of minor - to - moderate mergers .",
