    "the sensitivity of the first generation large - scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors operating now is extremely high .",
    "they can detect mechanical displacement as small as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity provides a real chance to detect gravitational waves from astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "however , routine observations of gravitational waves require at least one order of magnitude better sensitivity .",
    "this sensitivity improvement is planned for the second generation detectors , in particular , the advanced ligo @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the advanced ligo sensitivity will be close to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "this limitation corresponds to the sensitivity level where the meter measurement noise ( the shot noise in the optical interferometric position meters case ) becomes equal to the meter back action noise ( _ i.e. _ the radiation pressure fluctuations ) .",
    "the first noise is inversely proportional to the optical power and the second one is directly proportional to it .    several methods of overcoming the sql have been proposed .",
    "one of the most promising is the _ quantum variational measurement _",
    "it uses correlation between the measurement noise and back - action noise , which allows , in principle , to remove the back - action noise component from the meter output .",
    "frequency - independent correlation can be introduced in the optical position meters relatively easy by using homodyne detector with properly adjusted local oscillator phase . however , in this case the back - action suppression is possible in narrow frequency band only .",
    "the method of creating the frequency - dependent noise correlation in large - scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors was proposed and analyzed in detail in the article @xcite .",
    "it is based on the use of additional _ filter cavities _ which introduce frequency - dependent phase shift into the reflected light .",
    "these cavities can be placed before the main interferometer ( so - called _ modified input optics _ case ) as well as after it ( _ modified output optics _ ) . in the former case a squeezed quantum state have to be used . in the latter one , it is not necessary but desirable because allows to decrease the required optical power .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of this technology application to the signal recycled topology , planned for the advanced ligo and used in the operating now smaller geo-600 gravitational wave detector @xcite , was performed in the articles @xcite .",
    "the main technical problem of this method arises due to the requirement that the filter cavities bandwidths should be of the same order of magnitude as the gravitational - wave signal frequency @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the filter cavities quality factors have to be as high as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the laser pumping frequency .",
    "therefore , long filter cavities with very high - reflectivity mirrors should be used .",
    "filter cavities with the same length as the main interferometer cavities ( 4 km ) , placed in the same vacuum chamber side - by - side with the latter ones , were considered in the article @xcite .",
    "this topology allows , in principle , to obtain sensitivity significantly better than the sql and probably will be used in the third ( post advanced ligo ) generation of the laser gravitational - wave detectors ( see brief discussion on the technical issues of this topology in paper @xcite ) .    in the current article",
    "the topology based on the same principle but less ambitious and more simple in implementation is considered .",
    "it contains only one relatively short filter cavity with length comparable to the advanced ligo auxiliary mode - cleaner cavities : a few tens of meters . we suppose here that the main interferometer parameters values are close to those planned for the advanced ligo . in particular",
    ", we suppose that :    * the optical power circulating in the interferometer arms is equal to the power necessary to reach the sql , @xmath5 ; * the technical noises : the mirrors thermal noise , the suspensions thermal noise , _ etc _ are the same as planned for the advanced ligo . *",
    "the interferometer is tuned in resonance and thus the `` optical springs '' technology @xcite is not used ; * no quantum squeezed states are used    ( see the brief discussion on the last two items in the conclusion ) . it should be noted that the case of short ( 30 meters long ) cavities was considered in paper @xcite .",
    "however , the authors of this paper followed the original optimization procedure of @xcite which does not provide very good results for such short cavities . here",
    "we propose another optimization method more suitable for short filter cavities with relatively high optical losses .",
    "it follows from the planned advanced ligo noise budget that the only frequency range where it is possible to increase the sensitivity without the increase of circulating power and/or use of squeezed quantum states , and without reducing the mirrors internal noise , is the low - frequency area @xmath6 , where the sensitivity is limited by the radiation - pressure noise .",
    "it is this area that is considered in this article .    in sec.[sec :",
    "scheme ] , the measurement scheme and the main noise sources are discussed . in sec.[sec : varmeas ] a new `` soft '' variant of variational measurement optimization is introduced . in sec.[sec : estimates ] , the achievable sensitivity is estimated . the main notations and parameters values used in this paper",
    "are listed in table[tab : notations ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sensitivity frequency dependence of the schemes listed in table[tab : results ] is shown in fig.[fig : s_sep ] , where square roots of the corresponding quantum noise spectral densities @xmath7 are plotted using the parameters sets of table[tab : results ] , together with the square root of the sum non - quantum noise @xmath8 .",

    "the quantum noise is suppressed at medium frequencies ( @xmath14 ) , while rises at higher frequencies . it could be noted , however , that the variational scheme considered here has the same signal - to - noise ratio for this type of signals even for the worst of the considered losses combinations ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 ) , while providing a more flat broadband noise curve .",
    "it follows from the estimates made in this paper that using variational measurement with single relatively short filter cavity , it is possible to reduce the back action noise in the advanced ligo interferometer to the level comparable to or smaller than the low - frequency noises of non - quantum origin : mirrors suspension noise , mirrors internal thermal noise , and gravity gradients fluctuations .",
    "the minimal reasonable filter cavity length for the best mirrors available ( with losses per bounce @xmath15 ) is about @xmath16 . in this case , about 2-fold increase of the advanced ligo sensitivity at low frequencies is feasible .",
    "better mirrors , with losses per bounce @xmath17 and/or longer filter cavity would be able to virtually remove the back - action noise from the advanced ligo noise budget .",
    "it is evident , that the scheme considered here can be combined with other methods , which also allows to increase the interferometric gravitational wave detectors sensitivity without significant modifications of the topology and without the increase of optical power .",
    "in particular , using the the optical rigidity @xcite , it is possible to reshape the noise spectral dependence , extending the low frequency sensitivity gain to the medium frequencies range .",
    "another promising option is the squeezed vacuum injection into the interferometer dark port @xcite .",
    "it allows to decrease the shot noise at the cost of increased radiation pressure noise ( for the same value of the mean optical power ) .",
    "the radiation pressure noise , in turn , can be reduced at low frequencies by using variational measurement of the type considered here . in paper",
    "@xcite the method of generation of squeezed states with frequency - dependent _ amplitude _ of squeezing , which could provide an additional suppression of the radiation - pressure noise , was proposed .",
    "taking into account the recent achievements in preparation of squeezed quantum states at low frequencies ( @xmath18 ) @xcite , it possible to hope that this combination could provide the sensitivity gain of @xmath19 within the entire advanced ligo frequency band .",
    "the author is grateful to v.braginsky , y.chen , s.danilishin , n.mavalvala , k.strain , and s.vyatchanin for stimulating discussions and useful remarks .",
    "the author is grateful also to y.chen for the remark about the `` slack '' low - frequency area in the advanced ligo noise budget which stimulated this paper writing ."
