    "our study is carried out for the prisoner s dilemma game ( pd ) .",
    "this has often been used to model selfish behavior of individuals in situations , where it is risky to cooperate and tempting to defect , but where the outcome of mutual defection is inferior to cooperation on both sides @xcite .",
    "formally , the so - called `` reward '' @xmath0 represents the payoff for mutual cooperation , while the payoff for defection on both sides is the `` punishment '' @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 represents the `` temptation '' to unilaterally defect , which results in the `` sucker s payoff '' @xmath3 for the cooperating individual . given the inequalities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which define the classical prisoner s dilemma , it is more profitable to defect , no matter what strategy the other individual selects .",
    "therefore , rationally behaving individuals would be expected to defect when they meet _",
    "once_. however , defection by everyone is implied as well by the game - dynamical replicator equation @xcite , which takes into account imitation of superior strategies , or payoff - driven birth - and - death processes .",
    "in contrast , a coexistence of cooperators and defectors is predicted for the snowdrift game ( sd ) . while it is also used to study social cooperation ,",
    "its payoffs are characterized by @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 ) .    as is well - known @xcite , cooperation can , for example , be supported by repeated interactions @xcite , by intergroup competition with or without altruistic punishment @xcite , and by network reciprocity based on the clustering of cooperators @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the level of cooperation in two - dimensional spatial games is further enhanced by `` disordered environments '' ( approximately 10% unaccessible empty locations ) @xcite , and by diffusive mobility , provided that the mobility parameter is in a suitable range @xcite .",
    "however , strategy mutations , random relocations , and other sources of stochasticity ( `` noise '' ) can significantly challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters . when no mobility or undirected , random mobility are considered , the level of cooperation in the spatial games studied by us is sensitive to noise ( see figs . 1d and 3c ) , as favorable correlations between cooperative neighbors are destroyed . _",
    "success - driven _ migration , in contrast , is a robust mechanism : by leaving unfavorable neighborhoods , seeking more favorable ones , and remaining in cooperative neighborhoods , it supports cooperative clusters very efficiently against the destructive effects of noise , thus preventing defector invasion in a large area of payoff parameters .",
    "we assume @xmath9 individuals on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath10 sites , which are either empty or occupied by one individual .",
    "individuals are updated asynchronously , in a random sequential order .",
    "the randomly selected individual performs simultaneous interactions with the @xmath11 direct neighbors and compares the overall payoff with that of the @xmath12 neighbors .",
    "afterwards , the strategy of the best performing neighbor is copied with probability @xmath13 ( `` imitation '' ) , if the own payoff was lower . with probability @xmath14 ,",
    "however , the strategy is randomly `` reset '' : * noise 1 * assumes that an individual spontaneously chooses to cooperate with probability @xmath15 or to defect with probability @xmath16 until the next strategy change . the resulting strategy mutations may be considered to reflect deficient imitation attempts or trial - and - error behavior . as a side effect",
    ", such noise leads to an independence of the finally resulting level of cooperation from the initial one at @xmath17 , and a _ qualitatively different _ pattern formation dynamics for the same payoff values , update rules , and initial conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ s1 ] ) . using the alternative fermi update rule",
    "@xcite would have been possible as well .",
    "however , resetting strategies rather than inverting them , combined with values @xmath15 much smaller than 1/2 , has here the advantage of creating particularly adverse conditions for cooperation , independently of what strategy prevails .",
    "below , we want to learn , if predominant cooperation can survive or even emerge under such adverse conditions .",
    "`` success - driven migration '' has been implemented as follows @xcite : before the imitation step , an individual explores the expected payoffs for the empty sites in the migration neighborhood of size @xmath18 ( the moore neighborhood of range @xmath19 ) .",
    "if the fictitious payoff is higher than in the current location , the individual is assumed to move to the site with the highest payoff and , in case of several sites with the same payoff , to the closest one ( or one of them ) ; otherwise it stays put .",
    "computer simulations of the above model show that , in the _ imitation - only _ case of classical spatial games with noise 1 , but _ without _ a migration step , the resulting fraction of cooperators in the pd tends to be very low .",
    "it basically reflects the fraction @xmath20 of cooperators due to strategy mutations . for @xmath21",
    ", we find almost frozen configurations , in which only a small number of cooperators survive ( see fig .",
    "[ s1]d ) . in the _ migration - only _ case without an imitation step ,",
    "the fraction of cooperators changes only by strategy mutations .",
    "even when the initial strategy distribution is uniform , one observes the formation of spatio - temporal patterns , but the patterns get almost frozen after some time ( see fig .",
    "[ s1]e ) .",
    "it is interesting that , although for the connectivity structure of our pd model neither imitation only ( fig . [ s1]d ) nor migration only ( fig . [ s1]e ) can promote cooperation under noisy conditions , their _ combination _ does : computer simulations show the formation of cooperative clusters with a few defectors at their boundaries ( see fig .",
    "once cooperators are organized in clusters , they tend to have more neighbors and to reach higher payoffs on average , which allows them to survive @xcite",
    ". it will now have to be revealed , how success - driven migration causes the _ formation _ of clusters at all , considering the opposing noise effects .",
    "in particular , we will study , why defectors fail to invade cooperative clusters and to erode them from within , although a cooperative environment is most attractive to them .    to address these questions , figure 2 studies a `` defector s paradise '' with a single defector in the center of a cooperative cluster . in the noisy _ imitation - only _",
    "spatial prisoner s dilemma , defection tends to spread up to the boundaries of the cluster , as cooperators imitate more successful defectors ( see figs .",
    "but if imitation is combined with _ success - driven migration _",
    ", the results are in sharp contrast : although defectors still spread initially , cooperative neighbors who are @xmath19 steps away from the boundary of the cluster can now evade them . due to this defector - triggered migration",
    ", the neighborhood reconfigures itself adaptively .",
    "for example , a large cooperative cluster may split up into several smaller ones ( see figs .",
    "eventually , the defectors end up at the boundaries of these cooperative clusters , where they often turn into cooperators by imitation of more successful cooperators in the cluster , who tend to have more neighbors .",
    "this promotes the spreading of cooperation @xcite .",
    "since evasion takes time , cooperative clusters could still be destroyed when continuously challenged by defectors , as it happens under noisy conditions .",
    "therefore , let us now study the effect of different kinds of randomness @xcite .",
    "* noise 1 * ( defined above ) assumes _ strategy mutations _ , but leaves the spatial distribution of individuals unchanged ( see fig .",
    "* noise 2 * , in contrast , assumes that individuals , who are selected with probability @xmath14 , move to a randomly chosen free site without considering the expected success _",
    "( random relocations ) .",
    "_ such random moves may potentially be of long distance and preserve the number of cooperators , but have the potential of destroying spatial patterns ( see fig .",
    "* noise 3 * combines noise 1 and noise 2 , assuming that individuals randomly relocate with probability @xmath14 and additionally reset their strategy as in noise 1 ( see fig .",
    "3c ) .    while cooperation in the imitation - only case is quite sensitive to noise ( see figs .",
    "3a - c ) , the combination of imitation with success - driven motion is not ( see fig .",
    "3d - f ) : whenever an empty site inside a cluster of cooperators occurs , it is more likely that the free site is entered by a cooperator than by a defector , as long as cooperators prevail within the migration range @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the formation of small cooperative clusters was observed for _ all _ kinds of noise .",
    "that is , the combination of imitation with success - driven migration is a robust mechanism to maintain and even spread cooperation under various conditions , given there are enough cooperators in the beginning .",
    "it is interesting , whether this mechanism is also able to facilitate a spontaneous _ outbreak _ of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness , without a `` shadow of the future '' @xcite .",
    "our simulation scenario assumes defectors only in the beginning ( see fig .",
    "4a ) , strategy mutations in favor of defection , and short - term payoff - maximizing behavior in the vast majority of cases . in order to study conditions under which a significant fraction of cooperators is unlikely ,",
    "our simulations are performed with noise 3 and @xmath21 , as it tends to destroy spatial clusters and cooperation ( see fig .",
    "3c ) : by relocating 5% randomly chosen individuals in each time step , noise 3 dissolves clusters into more or less separate individuals in the imitation - only case ( see figs .",
    "in the case with success - driven migration , random relocations break up large clusters into many smaller ones , which are distributed all over the space ( see figs . 3b+c and 4b ) . therefore",
    ", even the clustering tendency by success - driven migration can only partially compensate for the dispersal tendency by random relocations .",
    "furthermore , the strategy mutations involved in noise 3 tend to destroy cooperation ( see figs .",
    "3a+c , where the strategies of 5% randomly chosen individuals were replaced by defection in 95% of the cases and by cooperation otherwise , to create conditions favoring defection , i.e. the dominant strategy in the prisoner s dilemma ) .",
    "overall , as a result of strategy mutations ( i.e. without the consideration of imitation processes ) , only a fraction @xmath22 of all defectors turn into cooperators in each time step , while a fraction @xmath23 of all cooperators turn into defectors ( i.e. 5% in each time step ) .",
    "this setting is extremely unfavorable for the spreading of cooperators .",
    "in fact , defection prevails for an extremely long time ( see figs",
    ". 4b and [ s2]a ) . but",
    "suddenly , when a small , supercritical cluster of cooperators has occurred by coincidence ( see fig .",
    "4c ) , the fraction of cooperators spreads quickly ( see fig . [ s2]a ) , and soon cooperators prevail ( see figs . 4d and [ s2]b ) . note that this spontaneous birth of predominant cooperation in a world of defectors does not occur in the noisy imitation - only case and demonstrates that success - driven migration can overcome the dispersive tendency of noises 2 and 3 , if @xmath14 is moderate and @xmath15 has a finite value .",
    "that is , success - driven migration generates spatial correlations between cooperators more quickly than these noises can destroy them .",
    "this changes the outcome of spatial games essentially , as a comparison of figs .",
    "2a - d with 4a - d shows .",
    "the conditions for the spreading of cooperators from a supercritical cluster ( `` nucleus '' ) can be understood by configurational analysis @xcite ( see fig . *",
    "s1 * ) , but the underlying argument can be both , simplified and extended : according to fig .",
    "6a , the level of cooperation changes when certain lines ( or , more generally , certain hyperplanes ) in the payoff - parameter space are crossed .",
    "these hyperplanes are all of the linear form @xmath24 where @xmath25 . the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ 1 ] represents the payoff of the most successful cooperative neighbor of a focal individual , assuming that this has @xmath26 cooperating and @xmath27 defecting neighbors , which implies @xmath28 .",
    "the right - hand side reflects the payoff of the most successful defecting neighbor , assuming that @xmath29 is the number of his / her cooperating neighbors and @xmath30 the number of defecting neighbors , which implies @xmath31 . under these conditions ,",
    "the best - performing cooperative neighbor earns a payoff of @xmath32 , and the best - performing defecting neighbor earns a payoff of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the focal individual will imitate the cooperator , if @xmath34 , but copy the strategy of the defector if @xmath35 .",
    "equation [ 1 ] is the line separating the area where cooperators spread ( above the line ) from the area of defector invasion ( below it ) for a certain spatial configuration of cooperators and defectors ( see fig .",
    "every spatial configuration is characterized by a set of @xmath36-parameters . as expected",
    ", the relative occurence frequency of each configuration depends on the migration range @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "6b ) : higher values of @xmath19 naturally create better conditions for the spreading of cooperation , as there is a larger choice of potentially more favorable neighborhoods .",
    "figure 6b also shows that success - driven migration extends the parameter range , in which cooperators prevail , from the parameter range of the snowdrift game with @xmath7 to a considerable parameter range of the prisoner s dilemma .",
    "for this to happen , it is important that the attraction of cooperators is mutual , while the attraction of defectors to cooperators is not .",
    "more specifically , the attraction of cooperators is proportional to @xmath37 , while the attraction between defectors and cooperators is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the attraction between cooperators is stronger , because the prisoner s dilemma usually assumes the inequality @xmath5 .",
    "besides the speed of finding neighbors to interact with , the time scales of configurational changes and correlations matter as well : by entering a cooperative cluster , a defector triggers an avalanche of strategy changes and relocations , which quickly destroys the cooperative neighborhood . during this process",
    ", individuals may alter their strategy many times , as they realize opportunities by cooperation or defection immediately .",
    "in contrast , if a cooperator joins a cooperative cluster , this will stabilize the cooperative neighborhood .",
    "although cooperative clusters continuously adjust their size and shape , the average time period of their existence is longer than the average time period after which individuals change their strategy or location .",
    "this coevolution of social interactions and strategic behavior reflects features of many social environments : while the latter come about by individual actions , a suitable social context can make the average behavior of individuals more predictable , which establishes a reinforcement process . for example , due to the clustering tendency of cooperators , the likelihood of finding another cooperator in the neighborhood of a cooperator is greater than 1/2 , and also the likelihood that a cooperator will cooperate in the next iteration",
    "it is noteworthy that all the above features  the survival of cooperation in a large parameter area of the pd , spatio - temporal pattern formation , noise - resistance , and the outbreak of predominant cooperation  can be captured by considering a mechanism as simple as success - driven migration : success - driven migration _ destabilizes _ a homogeneous strategy distribution ( compare fig .",
    "[ s1]c with [ s1]a and fig .",
    "[ s1]f with [ s1]d ) .",
    "this triggers the spontaneous formation of agglomeration and segregation patterns @xcite , where noise or diffusion would cause dispersal in the imitation - only case .",
    "the self - organized patterns create self - reinforcing social environments characterized by behavioral correlations , and imitation promotes the further growth of supercritical cooperation clusters .",
    "while each mechanism by itself tends to produce frozen spatial structures , the combination of imitation and migration supports adaptive patterns ( see fig .",
    "this facilitates , for example , the regrouping of a cluster of cooperators upon invasion by a defector , which is crucial for the survival and success of cooperators ( see fig .",
    "2e - h ) .    by further simulations",
    "we have checked that our conclusions are robust with respect to using different update rules , adding birth and death processes , or introducing a small fraction of individuals defecting unconditionally .",
    "the same applies to various kinds of `` noise '' .",
    "noise can even trigger cooperation in a world full of defectors , when the probability of defectors to turn spontaneously into cooperators is 20 times smaller than the probability of cooperators to turn into defectors .",
    "compared to the implications of the game - dynamical replicator equation , this is remarkable : while the replicator equation predicts that the stationary solution with a majority of cooperators is _",
    "un_stable with respect to perturbations and the stationary solution with a majority of defectors is stable @xcite , success - driven migration _",
    "inverts _ the situation : the state of 100% defectors becomes _ unstable _ to noise , while a majority of cooperators is stabilized in a considerable area of the payoff parameter space .",
    "our results help to explain why cooperation can be frequent even if individuals would behave selfishly in the vast majority of interactions .",
    "although one may think that migration would weaken social ties and cooperation , there is another side of it which helps to establish cooperation in the first place , without the need to modify the payoff structure .",
    "we suggest that , besides the ability for strategic interactions and learning , the ability to _ move _ has played a crucial role for the evolution of large - scale cooperation and social behavior .",
    "success - driven migration can reduce unbalanced social interactions , where cooperation is unilateral , and support local agglomeration .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out that local agglomeration is an important precondition for the evolution of more sophisticated kinds of cooperation @xcite .",
    "for example , the level of cooperation could be further improved by combining imitation and success - driven migration with other mechanisms such as costly punishment @xcite , volunteering @xcite , or reputation @xcite .",
