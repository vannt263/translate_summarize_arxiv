    "star formation occurs inside giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and surveys of molecular gas in galaxies show that it is typically concentrated in large complexes or spiral arm segments having sizes up to a kiloparsec and masses up to @xmath0 @xmath1 ( solomon & sanders,1985 and elmegreen , 1993 )",
    ". these complexes may contain several giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with sizes up to @xmath2 parsecs ( pc ) and masses up to @xmath3 .",
    "the gmcs in turn , contain much smaller scale structures that may be filamentary or clumpy on a wide range of scales ( blitz , 1993 ; blitz & williams , 1999 ; williams , blitz & mckee , 2000 ) .",
    "the substructures found in gmcs range from massive clumps with sizes of several parsecs and thousands of solar masses , which may form entire clusters of stars , to small dense cloud cores with sizes of the order of @xmath4 pc and masses of the order of @xmath5 ( mendoza , 1985 ; cernicharo,1991 ; larson , 1994 ; williams , blitz & mckee , 2000 ; andre , ward - thompson & barsony , 2000 ; visser , richer & chandler , 2002 ) .",
    "the internal structure of molecular clouds is partly hierarchical , consisting of smaller subunits within larger ones ( scalo,1990 ; larson,1995 ; simon , 1997 ; stutzki et al . , 1998 ; elmegreen , 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the irregular boundaries of molecular clouds have fractal - like shapes resembling those of surfaces in turbulent flows , and this might mean that the shapes of molecular clouds are created by turbulence ( falgarone , phillips & walker , 1991 ; falgarone , puget & perault , 1992 ) . +",
    "most molecular clouds form stars , but very inefficiently , typically turning only a few percent of their mass into stars before being dispersed . despite the strong dominance of gravity over thermal pressure , this low efficiency has long been considered problematic , and implying that additional effects such as magnetic fields , angular momentum conservation or turbulence support these clouds in near - equilibrium against gravity and prevent a rapid collapse ( heiles et al . , 1993 ; mckee et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "+ the lifetimes and evolution of molecular clouds is provided by the ages of the associated newly formed stars and star clusters ( blaauw , 1991 ; larson,1994 ; elmegreen , 2000 ; andre , ward - thompson & barsony , 2000 ; hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin , 2001 ) .",
    "very few gmcs are known that are not forming stars , and the most massive and dense ones as a rule contain newly formed stars .",
    "they also can not survive for long after beginning to make stars , since the age span of the associated young stars and clusters is never more than @xmath6 myr , about the dynamical or crossing time of a large gmc .",
    "stars and clusters older than @xmath7 myr do not appear to be associated with molecular gas ( leisawitz , bash & thaddeus , 1989 ) .",
    "+ the youngest stars are associated with the denser parts of molecular clouds , and especially with the densest cloud cores that appear to be the direct progenitors of stars and stellar groupings ( mendoza,1985 ; lada , strom & myers , 1993 ; williams , blitz & mckee , 2000 ; andre , ward - thompson & barsony , 2000 ) .",
    "+ after several decades of study , the physical conditions in nearby star - forming molecular clouds are now fairly well understood , at least for the smaller nearby dark clouds that form mostly low - mass stars .",
    "however in the past @xmath8 years , infrared observations have revolutionized our understanding of star formation ( gutermuth et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the emission excess of young stars is well above that expected from reddened stellar photospheres and originates from the dusty circumstellar disks and envelopes surrounding young stars . for these reasons , colour - colour diagrams and cmds in the infrared ( ir )",
    "have proven to be excellent tools for identifying and classifying young stellar objects ( megeath et al .",
    "2004 ; harvey et al .",
    "2008 ; gutermuth et al .",
    "+ we intend to address the physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of pms stars in embedded star clusters which is crucial for understanding their properties .",

    "ic5146 is a reflection and emission nebula in the cygnus constellation centred at about @xmath9 , @xmath10 . to the east of the cloud there",
    "occurs a streamer .",
    "the streamer region corresponds to a long dark nebula discussed by wolf ( 1904 ) .",
    "hubble ( 1922 ) classified it in the optical as continuous , whereas minkowski ( 1947 ) listed the nebula to have h@xmath11 emissions .",
    "both are right , since ic5146 is a transition case between a reflection nebula and an hii region .",
    "many surveys at different wavelengths have been carried out in this region and associated clouds ( e.g. kramer et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "[ ic5146 ] shows an optical image of the ic5146 nebular and the streamer ( @xmath12 ) extending to the east . in the present study , one of us ( e.b . ) discovered 5 new ecs in the area of ic5146 using wise ( fig .",
    "[ figxx ] and [ figxxx ] ) .",
    "the w2 images in fig .",
    "[ figxx ] enhance the stellar and protostellar components of the clusters , while a w4 is sensitive to extended dust emission .",
    "sources brighter in w4 than in w2 are certainly due to the presence of dust envelopes or disks .",
    "nbb5 is projected close to ic5146 and all the clusters candidates apperar to be immersed in cold molecular material .",
    "the central coordinates of these ecs are given in table [ tab1 ] , together with the estimated angular radii .",

    "the ic5146 region has an important population of pms stars .",
    "embedded sources , sometimes known as protostars are optically invisible young stars .",
    "however , they are observed in the infrared and the majority is associated with the cloud ( see sect .",
    "3).we will explore ic5146 and the 5 ecs in the nebular complex using colour - colour diagrams and cmds ( bonatto & bica , 2007 ; camargo , bica & bonatto , 2015 ) . in this work",

    ".the embedded cluster ic 5146 and the 5 newly found ecs along the streamer [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes - the adopted methods and references are :    johnson & hilter ( 1956)-zams ; [ 2 ] walborn ( 1972)-zams ; [ 3]blaauw ( 1963)-zams ; [ 4 ] balona & feast ( 1975)-zams ; [ 5 ] star counts ; [ 6 ] allen et al.(1982)-zams ; [ 7 ] jaschek & gomez ( 1998)-ms ; [ 8 ] harvey et al.(2008)-onc zams ; [ 9 ] pms and ms .",
    "the majority of the embedded clusters do not survive the first few ten myr , especially the low - mass ones , given the interplay among environmental conditions , star - formation efficiency , initial stellar dynamical state and mass fraction converted into stars or expelled .",
    "it is important to investigate the structural and photometric properties in this early phase .",
    "we report the discovery of @xmath13 ecs along the streamer to the east of ic5146 and compare their cmds and colour - colour diagrams , suggesting a similarity of properties among them .",
    "the features in the colour - colour diagrams of the streamer and the 5 ecs are compatible with an age of @xmath14 @xmath13 myr ( fig .",
    "[ ccs ] and table [ tab2 ] ) . in principle , the detailed distribution of stars within the pms area in the cmd plane reflects the star formation history of the embedded population .",
    "the relative mean ages of young clusters can be established to greater precision by using a single or a consistent set of pms models to extract the cluster ages ( e.g. , haisch et al . , 2001a and bressan et al . , 2012",
    ")    in all five new ecs ( table [ tab2 ] ) , the young stars identified by their excess emission in the mid - ir are possibly distributed in a range of distances .",
    "in contrast , the diameters of clusters by star counts are typically 4 pc or less ( lada & lada , 2003 ) .",
    "this confirms that a significant fraction of gas in each star - forming region forms outside and surrounding the clustered region .",
    "the distances and uncertainties suggest that the nbbs clusters are associated physically .",
    "possibly nbb2 is a bit far .",
    "the 2mass cmds ( fig.[cmds ] ) and estimated number of stars in column 7 in table [ tab1 ] provide that ic5146 is by far , the most populous in the sample .",
    "futhermore , we suggest that star formation in ic5146 is continuing in the halo , while the molecular gas has been dispersed toward the cluster core and streamer .",

    "2004 have discussed yso classifications .",
    "[ fig_8 ] shows matched irac colors of ic5146 , together with model loci by allen et al .",
    "the data seem to cluster into three main regions : ( i ) a clump around @xmath15 $ ] that contains mostly background / foreground stars and class iii sources with no intrinsic ir excess , ( ii ) a clump that occupies the class ii region ( within the large red box ) , and a group that runs along the class i locus .",
    "sources that lie between the @xmath16 colors of stellar photospheres and class iii stars @xmath17 $ ] and class ii sources @xmath18 $ ] can be understood if we suggests the effects of dust grain growth and settling .",
    "in addition , there are a few sources that do not lie inside the class ii locus but do lie along the extinction vector and could therefore be reddened class ii objects .",
    "the most extreme points might be trace filaments and high opacity ( dark even at @xmath19 ) , consistent with the large @xmath20 implied by this scenario .",
    "alternatively , they could be extremely low luminosity class i sources .",
    "thus , the class i stage ( fig .",
    "[ cmds ] to [ fig_9 ] ) is a later stage of protostellar collapse .",
    "the class ii stage ( fig . [ fig_8 ] ) is characterized by the presence of excess of ir emission above that expected for a stellar photosphere .",
    "these stars can be inside it or lie along the extinction vector and could therefore be reddened .",
    "this is the signature of a classical t tauri surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "infall from the cloud has ceased owing to dispersal of the remnant infall envelope by the combined effects of infall and outflow ( allen et al . 2004 ; megeath et al . 2004 ; sung , bessell & lee , 1997 ) .",
    "the class iii stage can last for about @xmath0yr ending in a zero - age main - sequence star ( palla , 1999 ) .",
    "the distribution of sources in each ec is strikingly similar , but some distinct concentrations of stars are also apparent ( figs .",
    "[ cmds ] to [ fig_str ] ) .",
    "all ecs in the sample have central density excesses ( fig .",
    "[ rdps ] ) . the ecs appear to have an extra dust content , possibly related to a younger age .",
    "on the other hand , ic 5146 has a prominent rdp core .",
    "the rdps in fig .",
    "5 were constructed with spitzer data , except for nbb1 that is not in the spitzer field , so its rdp was built with wise data .",
    "ages throughout the complex are approximately constant at @xmath21 myr ( table [ tab2 ] ) . v absorptions are strong . ic5146 and the streamer characterize the complex , at distance @xmath22 kpc , nbb2 , nbb3 and nbb4 appear to lie a bit farther ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the streamer is an optical dark nebula ( fig.1 ) , that in the near ir is composed of many stars .",
    "the streamer is a prestellar region ( roy et al .",
    "2011 , kramer et al .",
    "2003 ) with essencially no emission from warm grains .",
    "it might be a particular stage in evolution of clouds , with a mix dust phases at different temperatures .",
    "dobashi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have suggested that outflows have played an important role in supporting the parent cloud from collapsing .",
    "we conclude that the streamer is stiil a _",
    "box to be further explored .",
    "the present analyses suggest that the ic5146 cluster , the streamer and the 5 newly found embedded clusters are neighbouring primeval examples of extended star formation and they are crucial for future more detailed studies of ic5146 complex , and * for comparisons with other star forming regions . *",
