    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter a06 ) measured a tight correlation between the bondi accretion rates @xmath3 and jet powers @xmath4 of the nuclei of nine nearby , x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies using _ chandra _ x - ray observations .",
    "it is imperative to understand how this correlation is established and what constraints on the properties of the central black holes can be derived from it .",
    "this is the goal of the present work .",
    "the origin of jets is likely to be related to the spin of the central black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with this in mind , we employ two physical models of jet production which relate the spin @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and accretion rate @xmath7 onto the black hole to the observed jet power in order to understand the empirical correlation of a06 : the blandford - znajek ( bz ) model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which magnetic fields threading the hole extract its rotational energy and drive the jet ; and a `` hybrid model '' @xcite which combines the blandford - payne and bz mechanisms , in which the fields tap energy from the accretion flow and the spinning hole .",
    "we assume that in the nuclei of the observed elliptical galaxies the accretion flow around the black hole is advection - dominated ( advection - dominated accretion flows , hereafter adaf , e.g. , @xcite , see also contribution of f. yuan in this volume ) .",
    "adafs are expected to be associated with the production of radio jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we take into account general relativistic effects not fully appreciated before in such models , in particular the dependence of the radius of the marginally stable orbit ( @xmath8 ) on the black hole spin , and frame - dragging effects that intensify the magnetic field strength .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows the spin dependence of @xmath4 we obtain from the modelling .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) illustrates the accretion rates and spins required to reproduce the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath9 . for typical values of the viscosity parameter @xmath0",
    ", we obtain that the tight correlation of a06 implies the narrow range of spins @xmath10 and accretion rates @xmath11 .",
    "these results are discussed in more depth in @xcite .",
