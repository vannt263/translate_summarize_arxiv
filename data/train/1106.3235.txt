    "understanding the various correlations and relationships amongst the different parts of a many body quantum system is one of the most difficult challenges in quantum theory .",
    "it is well known that the reduced density operators defined by partial traces characterize subsystems .",
    "consider a system of three parties @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 : if all three two - particle density operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are consistent with some global density operator @xmath7 , they must satisfy @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of @xmath7 .",
    "as the particle number @xmath0 becomes very large , the correlations between local subsystems become much more complicated . in general , local consistency is the problem of deciding whether a given collection of subsystem descriptions is consistent with some state of the global system , or the problem of finding necessary and sufficient condition for consistency of subsystem descriptions .",
    "it is also called the quantum marginal problem in literature@xcite .",
    "the community observed the relation between the spectrum of bipartite quantum states and certain representations of the symmetric groups very recently .",
    "the consistency conditions for some special classes of quantum states were then given in @xcite .",
    "for general states with overlapping margins , the situation remains unclear .",
    "if the particles under consideration are fermions instead of qubits , the local consistency problem has been known as the @xmath0-representability problem , which arose initially in the 1960 s in connection with calculating the ground - state energies of general interacting electrons@xcite .",
    "it was only recently shown in @xcite that both deciding the local consistency and deciding the local consistency for fermions are qma - complete , meaning both the consistency problem and the @xmath0-representability problem are computationally at least as hard as any other problem in the complexity class qma . here , qma is the quantum analogue of the complexity class np .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely to have efficient algorithms for local consistency problems , even on a quantum computer .",
    "and very recently , wei , et al . proved that the bosonic version of the @xmath0-representability problem is also qma - complete@xcite .",
    "though the local consistency problem is theoretically hard in the worst case , it is still worth exploring the potential solutions .",
    "there are various approaches scattered through the literature on this subject .",
    "linden , et al . proved that almost every three - qubit pure state can be uniquely determined among all states by their two - party reduced states@xcite .",
    "a related fermionic version was discussed in @xcite , whose results indicate that almost any three fermion pure state is uniquely determined among all states by their two - particle reduced states , though it was not stated explicitly .",
    "linden et al.s result was later generalized to @xmath0-particle systems@xcite .    in this paper , we will focus on another direction of the local consistency problem .",
    "we are interested in how simple the solution can be , or more specifically , how small the rank of a solution can be . the same question for bipartite quantum system without overlapping margins",
    "was discussed in @xcite , but their approach seems technically difficult to generalize to the case with overlapping margins . in this work , we consider this problem regarding the rank of the solution in a very general setting , for multipartite quantum systems with overlapping margins .",
    "we provide a rank reduction based approach .",
    "we also show that some useful results from convex analysis can be applied to this problem directly , though it leads to a slightly weaker bound than ours for details . ] .",
    "then we will apply our results to ferminonic and bosonic systems .",
    "finally local consistency problem for quantum channels will be addressed .",
    "we now state our main result . for a given finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath11 , @xmath12 will denote the space of bounded linear operators acting on @xmath11 . for the @xmath13-fold tensor product @xmath14 and any integer @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are general pauli @xmath18-gate and general pauli @xmath19-gate for @xmath20-th qudit respectively .",
    "formally , the local consistency problem can be stated as follows .",
    "consider a multipartite quantum system @xmath21 with hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "given a set of reduced density operators @xmath23 where each @xmath24 acts on a subsystem @xmath25 of @xmath26 , or @xmath27 .",
    "the local consistency problem is to address the existence of a global density operator @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 for any @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 here is the complement of @xmath25 .",
    "an _ instance _ of the local consistency problem is a collection of pairs : a reduced density operator @xmath32 and corresponding subsystem @xmath25 . for any given instance @xmath33 of the local consistency problem ,",
    "if there is a global density operator @xmath28 satisfying @xmath34 for any @xmath30 , then we say @xmath33 is a _",
    "compatible _ instance .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that compatible local density operators are reduced states of some simple ( low rank ) global density operator . more specifically ,",
    "we have following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main ] for any compatible instance of local consistency problem @xmath33 , there is a solution with rank no more than @xmath35 .",
    "we are primarily interested in instances where the whole system is @xmath36 and only no more than @xmath37-particle reduced states are known . in this case , the number of reduced states should be no more than @xmath38 , the rank is bounded by polynomial in @xmath13 while the rank of a general density operator should be exponential in @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . after introducing the requisite background material in section  [ sec : pre ] ,",
    "we give a proof of above theorem in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "we then apply these ideas to the @xmath0-representability problem in section  [ sec : nrep ] . in section  [ sec : channel ]",
    "we introduce the notion of consistency of quantum channels .",
    "some examples are illustrated in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "since the local density operators of this instance are known to be compatible , we can start from some solution @xmath39 , which is a density operator acting on @xmath40 and @xmath34 for any @xmath30 . using a spectral decomposition of @xmath39 we may write @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are mutually orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "we will show that when @xmath44 is large , then we can find another solution @xmath45 to the same instance and @xmath46 .",
    "consider the spectral decompositions again and write    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are mutually orthogonal unit vectors for any @xmath20 .",
    "consider the following set : @xmath50 here , for each @xmath20 , @xmath51 is a projector on @xmath52 .",
    "now , @xmath53 is a subspace of dimension at least @xmath54 .    if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 is not empty .",
    "let s say there is a non - zero @xmath57 which implies @xmath58 too .",
    "thus both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are traceless hermitian operators in @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 can not be zero simultaneously when @xmath18 is not the zero operator . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume @xmath63 is non - zero .",
    "@xmath64 is chosen from @xmath65 , or equivalently , there is some @xmath66 such that @xmath67 which follows @xmath68 for any @xmath20 .",
    "thus hermitian operator @xmath69 lies completely in @xmath70 that implies @xmath71 and then @xmath72 .",
    "since the operator @xmath73 contains both positive and negative eigenvalues , the same holds for @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "hence there exists an intermediate value @xmath76 for which the operator @xmath74 is nonnegative , but not strictly positive , i.e. @xmath74 is a degenerate density matrix we are looking for .",
    "now , for any solution @xmath39 to a given instance @xmath77 , if @xmath55 , we can always find a non - zero traceless hermitian operator @xmath78,and then another solution @xmath79 to the same instance with rank less than @xmath80 .",
    "thus , by repeating this procedure until above quadratic inequality does nt hold anymore , we will finally end with a solution @xmath81 with @xmath82 .    for any instance of the local consistency problem with given local systems",
    "@xmath83 , if the solution set is nonempty , then there is a solution with rank no more than @xmath84 .    [ convex ]",
    "barvinok proved that if there is a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath18 satisfying @xmath85 where @xmath86 are symmetric matrices and @xmath87 are complex numbers , then there is a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath88 satisfying the same equation system and additionally @xmath89@xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of his proof are the duality for linear programming in the quadratic form space . after applying barvinok s theorem to the local consistency problem",
    ", we will have a similar rank reduction which will lead to a solution with rank no more than @xmath90 .",
    "thus this result is weaker than ours .",
    "in this section , we will study the @xmath0-representability problem , which is a fermionic analogue of the local consistency problem .",
    "the bosonic version of @xmath0-representability is also addressed later .",
    "we first restate the @xmath0-representability problem as follows .    given a system of @xmath0 fermions where each particle has @xmath91 energy levels , and a @xmath92-fermion state @xmath39 of size @xmath93 , determine whether there exists an @xmath0-fermion state @xmath81 such that @xmath94 .    according to the pauli exclusion principle",
    ", no two particles can occupy the same state , thus we can always assume @xmath95 .",
    "the space of @xmath0-fermion pure states is mathematically described as the @xmath0-th antisymmetric tensor product of @xmath96 with dimension @xmath97 , denoted as @xmath98 .",
    "it is the span of all @xmath0-fold antisymmetric tensor products of vectors @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 in @xmath96 which is defined as @xmath103 here , @xmath104 goes through all permutations of @xmath0 indices and @xmath105 is the signature of @xmath104 .",
    "so @xmath105 is @xmath106 , if the number of even - order cycles in @xmath104 s cycle type is even , and @xmath107 otherwise .",
    "similarly , the space of @xmath0-boson pure states with @xmath91 energy levels corresponds to the @xmath0-th symmetric tensor product of @xmath96 with dimension @xmath108 , denoted as @xmath109 .    for more information about @xmath0-th symmetric / antisymmetric tensor product",
    ", please refer to @xcite .    for the @xmath0-representability problem",
    ", there is a similar rank reduction as follows .",
    "[ thm : fermion ] suppose we are given a system of @xmath0 fermions where each particle has @xmath91 energy levels and a @xmath92-fermion density operator @xmath39 of size @xmath93 .",
    "assume there exists an @xmath0-fermion state @xmath81 such that @xmath94 .",
    "then there also exists an @xmath0-fermion density operator @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the proof is similar to the proof provided in section  [ sec : proof ] , with minor modifications .",
    "observe that the whole rank reduction in our approach is processed in @xmath113 .",
    "after introducing additional symmetry to the global system , the rank reduction also works by replacing @xmath114 with @xmath98 or @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , we will also get the following theorem for the bosonic version .",
    "[ thm : boson ] suppose we have a system of @xmath0 bosons where each particle has @xmath91 energy levels and a @xmath92-boson density operator @xmath39 of size @xmath115 .",
    "assume there exists an @xmath0-boson state @xmath81 such that @xmath94 , then there also exists an @xmath0-boson density operator @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath116 .",
    "in this section , we will investigate a new type of consistency  the consistency of quantum channels .",
    "a quantum channel is a device which transmits classical bits or quantum states .",
    "mathematically , it is a linear map which maps any quantum state on some hilbert space @xmath117 to another state on some hilbert space @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , a quantum channel can be described by a completely - positive , trace - preserving map @xmath119 .    generally , for a quantum channel from system @xmath117 to @xmath118 , we shall think of @xmath120 as part of a closed composite system @xmath121 and @xmath122 as part of another closed composite system @xmath123 which has same dimension as @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the evolution from @xmath121 to @xmath123 can be described by some unitary operator @xmath124 .",
    "the quantum channel @xmath119 is then described as @xmath125    by stinespring s dilation theorem on completely positive maps , @xmath119 must take following form @xmath126 where @xmath127 are some operators , called kraus operators of @xmath119 .",
    "trace preservation of @xmath119 is equivalent to the sum @xmath128 equaling the identity operator .",
    "the number of kraus operators @xmath0 is no more than @xmath129 , and the minimum number of @xmath0 is called the kraus rank of @xmath119 . in some sense ,",
    "the smaller the kraus rank is , the simpler the channel is .",
    "the concept of channel consistency is quite intuitive .",
    "consider the following scenario , in which there is a channel from some large system @xmath117 to some large system @xmath118 . here , the mapping is from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "a local observer alice can only gather information from part of @xmath117 , say @xmath132 and part of @xmath118 , say @xmath133 ; therefore , she has information about the partial mapping from @xmath134 to @xmath135 .",
    "another observer bob has his information about the partial mapping from some @xmath136 to some @xmath137 .",
    "so do any other observers .",
    "several questions naturally arise .",
    "how much information about the global quantum channel can be known when alice , bob and other observers disclose their local information ?",
    "if every observer has a description of some partial mapping , is there a global channel satisfying all these local constraints ?",
    "can we find some simple channel satisfying local constraints if the local descriptions are known to be compatible ?",
    "there are some subtle differences between state consistency and channel consistency .",
    "the most confusing part is , how to describe part of a quantum channel , or the partial mapping from a local system to another local system ? there is no doubt that part of a quantum state @xmath39 , described by applying some partial trace on @xmath39 , is definitely positive - semidefinite and trace @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , part of a quantum state is again a quantum state .",
    "however , in the quantum channel setting , the analogue of the above property is not so straightforward .",
    "one may even doubt part of a quantum channel may not be a quantum channel at all .",
    "thanks to the channel - state duality , we can define sub - channel of some quantum channel as the following . given any channel @xmath138 , we can always write a corresponding state of @xmath139 to be @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath117 . the state @xmath142 is called the choi - jamiolkowski state of @xmath139 and the association above defines an isomorphism between linear maps from @xmath130 to @xmath131 and operators in @xmath143 , called the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism . its rank is equal to the kraus rank of @xmath142 .    therefore , for any quantum channel @xmath144",

    ", we will address the following question : how simple the global channel can be , or more specifically , how small its kraus rank can be if the sub channels are known to be compatible .",
