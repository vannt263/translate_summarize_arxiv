    "circadian oscillators are prevalent in organisms from bacteria to human and serve to synchronize bodies with the environmental 24 h cycle  @xcite . although the molecular implementation of oscillation is species specific  @xcite , every circadian clocks satisfies two requirements to achieve the reliable synchronization to the environment : * entrainability * to synchronize internal time with periodic stimuli and * regularity * to oscillate with a precise period .",
    "circadian clocks are acquired through evolution independently in bacteria , fungi , plants and animals @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , entrainability and regularity constitute major characteristics conserved in all circadian clocks @xcite , which strongly suggests that these two properties are essential for survival .",

    "many studies have analyzed the resistance mechanisms of circadian oscillators against the noise  @xcite .",
    "regarding entrainability , circadian clocks synchronize their internal time with the environmental cycle via sunlight , and its effect depends on the wavelength or fluence , as well as on the phase of the stimulation .",
    "however , entrainability and regularity are conflicting factors , because circadian clocks with better entrainability are sensitive not only to the periodic light stimuli , but also to the molecular noise which interferes with regularity .",
    "since both regularity and entrainability are important adaptive values , we expect actual circadian oscillators to optimally satisfy these two factors ( fig .",

    "our main finding is the inherent existence of a dead zone in the prc : optimality is achieved only when the prcs have a time period during which light stimuli neither advance nor delay the clock ( fig .  [",

    "this result is intriguing because a dead zone , with which oscillators tend to be unaffected by stimuli ( i.e. lower entrainability ) , achieves better entrainability .",

    "the existence of a dead zone optimizes both entrainability and regularity .",
    "it is rather obvious that optimization of regularity alone leads to a dead zone @xcite , because null response means no effect by any kind of fluctuations .",
    "our result instead shows that optimality of both entrainability and regularity , which are in a trade - off relationship , is uniquely achieved by a dead zone .",
    "our finding is fairly general since a dead zone always exists in an optimal prc unless @xmath136 ( additive stimulation ) .",
    "along with the fact that @xmath23 , @xmath184 , and @xmath143 affect only the scaling of the optimal prcs , when the input signal affects the dynamics multiplicatively ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) , the existence of a dead zone always provides a synchronization advantage .",

    "our general result suggests that circadian oscillators have fully adapted to solar radiation to improve synchronization .",
    "indeed , many experimental findings imply that circadian oscillators have adapted to actual solar radiation @xcite : for various animals , light - dark ( ld ) cycles that include a twilight period result in better entrainability than do abrupt ld cycles ( on - off protocols ) @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "another interesting problem is optimal entrainment @xcite of circadian clocks by light stimuli . as two different input signals , the solar radiation and sinusoidal inputs ,",
    "yield the same optimal prcs for @xmath136 , optimal inputs and optimal prcs do not have one - to - one correspondence . thus the optimal inputs are not trivial and this problem should be pursued in our future studies .",
    "the solar radiation input plays an essential role , since it yields a dead zone in the optimal prc while a sinusoidal signal does not ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal_sinusoidal ] ) .",
    "in other words , oscillators that are entrained by stimuli other than solar radiation may not exhibit a dead zone in their prcs .",
    "this is indeed found in mammals .",
    "mammals possess a master clock in their suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) , which receives light stimuli via retinal photoreceptors , and peripheral clocks in body cells @xcite .",
    "the peripheral oscillators are entrained by several stimuli such as feeding and signals from the scn through chemical pathways ( e.g. , hormones ) @xcite . by injection experiments of the hormone , balsalobre _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the prcs of the peripheral oscillators in the liver did not have a dead zone .",
    "our result also agrees with other experimental observations .",
    "our theory implies that a dead zone should be located where the concentration @xmath99 is low ( @xmath185 in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation_fig](d ) ) , and that to achieve optimality , the concentration of @xmath99 should be maximal in the region where the prcs exhibit a large phase shift . in _ drosophila _",
    ", the _ timeless _ ( _ tim _ ) gene is regarded as the molecular implementation of @xmath99 .",
    "it is experimentally known that light enhances the degradation of the gene product ( the tim protein ) @xcite , and the tim protein peaks during the late evening .",
    "figure  [ fig : type_1_2_prcs](c ) shows observations of the prc of _ drosophila _ against light pulses as a function time ( hour ) from ref .",
    "@xcite ; circles describe the experimental data and the solid line expresses a trigonometric curve fitting ( 4th order ) , respectively . because the center of the part of the prc that can be phase shifted approximately corresponds to the peak of the concentration , as denoted above , when estimated from the prc alone ,",
    "the concentration peak of the tim protein should occur at about 18 h. this time is also close to the experimental evidence ( i.e. late evening ) .",
    "therefore , our theory can be used to hypothesize further molecular behavior affected by light stimuli .    in summary",
