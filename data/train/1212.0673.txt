    "the study of the statistical properties emerging from chaotic dynamics typically deals with equilibrium quantities and related convergence issues , asymptotic in time . on the other hand ,",
    "there is growing interest in applications of dynamical systems theory to problems where the dynamics is stopped or modified after a given event occurs .",
    "concrete examples include leaking systems @xcite and metastable states @xcite . in some cases we would like to understand the probability of a failure event as for example in the spreading of epidemics on networks @xcite . in other situations ,",
    "hitting a predetermined region in phase space could be a desirable event , as for example if that region is the only accessible part from which we can gain information @xcite .",
    "many of these situations are typically modelled by _",
    "open _ dynamical systems which we consider here .",
    "a closed , discrete - time evolution on a state space @xmath0 can be opened by defining a region @xmath1 in which particles can leak out , early work on such systems can be found in @xcite . if the dynamics is chaotic enough , the measure of points remaining in the system after @xmath2 iterates will decrease exponentially .",
    "the escape rate , which is the rate of the exponential decrease , is a well defined object , often admitting an interpretation as a spectral quantity and thus invariant for a large class of initial densities @xcite . on the contrary , in @xcite",
    "it was observed that varying the position of the hole has a strong effect on the average lifetime of chaotic transients due to the complex periodic orbit structure in chaotic maps .",
    "this dependence on the position of the hole has generated a renovated interest among both physicists and mathematicians ; in @xcite the escape rate was shown to have non - trivial dependence on the position and non - monotonic dependence on the size of the holes , general results on the asymptotic behavior for small holes have been studied in @xcite whilst in @xcite , the addition of noise is investigated .",
    "open problems and reviews of this material can be found in @xcite . despite the increasing interest in the properties of the escape rate ,",
    "explicit derivations remain a challenging task . here",
    "we introduce a method which greatly simplifies this task in the case of markov systems with a broad class of applications .",
    "the use of markov systems is ubiquitous in physics having applications in reaction - diffusion equations @xcite , chemical engineering @xcite , meteorology @xcite , genetics @xcite , ecology @xcite , absorbing states @xcite , neuronal dynamics @xcite , @xcite and quantum mechanics among others @xcite . in dynamical systems",
    "theory , markov systems are widely used in approximating more general open systems @xcite . via this method we derive results for both finite - size and asymptotically small holes . to this end , an explicit formula that relates the transfer operators for closed and open dynamical systems together with a return - time operator is derived .",
    "while escape processes are usually interpreted in the literal sense that points are removed from the system , we consider the following equivalent approach : a point that hits the hole does not leave the system , but rather it is coupled to a new point with negative mass .",
    "the two coupled particles are then evolved with the same dynamics of the closed system and their summed contribution to the total mass vanishes , as should be for an escaped particle . while being a mere reformulation of the problem , this approach makes apparent the fact that the effect of a leak is fully characterized by its dynamics within the closed system .",
    "this idea is built on the work of lind @xcite in topological dynamics and is reminiscent of the method of images which can be used to solve certain differential equations with dirichlet boundary conditions in electrostatics and transport problems .",
    "indeed , in random walk theory some absorbing boundary condition problems can be solved using the method of images @xcite .",
    "this is done via a symmetric initial condition with positive and negative mass in a corresponding system without absorbtion .",
    "we implement such an interpretation of escape through the transfer operator of the system .",
    "consider a closed dynamics @xmath3 .",
    "given a density of initial conditions @xmath4 , the perron - frobenius operator @xmath5 associated with @xmath6 evolves it to @xmath7(x)$ ] after @xmath2 iterates .",
    "the transfer operator of the corresponding open system is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the indicator function of the hole @xmath10 .",
    "the open system no longer conserves an invariant measure and the leading eigenvalue @xmath11 of @xmath12 has modulus smaller than one .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction is the so called conditionally invariant density and @xmath13 is the escape rate @xcite .    in the ulam scheme ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath6 is approximated by a markov chain @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be the @xmath15 corresponding transition matrix , @xmath16 being the number of partition elements in the chosen level of the ulam procedure .",
    "such kind of approximation has been used to study one - dimensional as well as higher dimensional dynamical systems , see for example @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath14 , that corresponds to fixing the accuracy of the markov approximation for the closed dynamics , we study the escape through a markov hole defined as an element of the @xmath17 refinement of the corresponding markov partition .",
    "in such situations the appropriate operator in equation ( [ eq : op_op ] ) is a transfer matrix written in the basis corresponding to _ all _ elements of the @xmath17 refinement of the markov partition .",
    "the size of such a matrix thus grows exponentially with @xmath18 . by showing that the conditionally invariant density is piecewise - constant on a much simpler basis ,",
    "we construct a transfer matrix for the open system which grows linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "note that this markov setting and its associated symbolic dynamics has also a direct interpretation in network dynamics @xcite where @xmath10 identifies an absorbing path on the network , and information theory @xcite where for example @xmath10 could correspond to a forbidden word in a communication channel .",
    "from now on we consider @xmath5 to be the operator associated with a given level in the ulam approximation of a closed system , @xmath19 the corresponding markov partition with partition parts @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 its @xmath23 refinement .",
    "fix @xmath24 and choose a hole @xmath25 .",
    "equivalently @xmath10 is defined by a fixed word @xmath26 of length @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a linear combination of constant functions on the elements of @xmath29 .",
    "from ( [ eq : op_op ] ) we have that @xmath30 obviously , @xmath31 is piecewise constant on @xmath32 and @xmath33 is constant on the set @xmath34 and zero elsewhere .",
    "furthermore @xmath35 where @xmath36 is piecewise constant on @xmath37 and zero elsewhere .",
    "more generally it is easy to see that any function that is piecewise constant on any @xmath22 is eventually attracted to the space of functions that are linear combinations of constant functions on the elements of @xmath38 .",
    "note that even if these sets are not disjoint , their indicator functions are linearly independent @xcite .",
    "the space they span is left invariant by the open dynamics of ( [ eq : op_op ] ) and thus contains the conditionally invariant measure .",
    "we therefore restrict the study of the open dynamics to such a space .",
    "the operator @xmath12 ( with @xmath39 , but note for @xmath40 in ( [ corrpoly ] ) , one can show that eqs.([eq : zeta_finite_final],[eq : zeta_fs ] ) hold for@xmath40 and @xmath41 . ] ) simplifies to    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 transition matrix for the closed system in the original partition @xmath19 ( we assume that the closed dynamics is chaotic enough so that @xmath43 is aperiodic ) . denoting by @xmath45 and @xmath46 the measure of the hole and of its parent partition element @xmath47 , with respect to the invariant measure @xmath48 of the closed system @xmath43 , we have @xmath49 .",
    "note that the minus signs can be interpreted as couplings to points with negative mass .",
    "the @xmath50 in the last row is in the @xmath51 column where @xmath52 is the partition part that the hole gets mapped onto after @xmath18 iterates , i.e. @xmath53 . the @xmath54 are the probabilities that points in @xmath10 return to @xmath10 at the @xmath55 iteration . as we will see , an important role is played by the _ weighted correlation polynomial _",
    "@xmath56    which is a weighted version of the one studied by guibas and odlyzko@xcite and lind @xcite in the context of topological dynamics .",
    "note that the coefficients in ( [ corrpoly ] ) and @xmath57 are easily computed in all practical situations .",
    "not only have we reduced the growth with @xmath58 of the size of the transfer matrix from exponential to linear , the specific form of @xmath59 allows us to explicitly derive the dynamical zeta function @xmath60 .",
    "the logarithm of the smallest zero of this determinant gives the escape rate .",
    "starting from the last row of @xmath61 , multiplying by @xmath62 and adding to the row above and continuing this process up to the @xmath63 , we expand the determinant along this row and obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dynamical zeta function of the closed system and @xmath66 denotes the minor on row @xmath67 and column @xmath68 .",
    "we stress that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are functions of the closed system only and are thus computable independent of the choice of the hole .",
    "the escape rate depends on the hole through its returns ( via @xmath71 and the indices @xmath72 of the parent and final partition elements ) and through its size ( via @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "in particular , finite - size holes with equal measure can have different escape rates due to different @xmath73 while different holes with seemingly different dynamics can have the same escape rate if their returns and size are equal . in the case of a bernoulli shift",
    "we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 implying that ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) reduces further to @xmath76 where @xmath77 differs from @xmath73 only in that the sum is taken to @xmath78 in ( [ corrpoly ] ) .",
    "there is a vast literature on the study of dynamical zeta functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) but general expressions that are easy to calculate such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ,  [ eq : zeta_fs ] ) are often not available @xcite . as a particular example of the usefulness of having an explicit zeta function ,",
    "consider a bernoulli shift on two symbols @xmath79 with transition probabilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 . from equation ( [ eq : zeta_fs ] ) we can derive a relation between the dynamical zeta functions of the hole defined by the word @xmath83 and of its ` child ' hole @xmath84 namely @xmath85 from ( [ eq : left_most_hole_parent ] ) we can see that for some values of @xmath86 the two holes have identical escape rates if the leading zero of @xmath87 is equal to that of @xmath88 while a crossover appears when the leading zero of @xmath89 comes from the @xmath90 term , as noted in @xcite .",
    "the crossover at @xmath91 is then obtained by solving @xmath92 .",
    "similar results are obtained swapping @xmath93 ( i.e. @xmath94 ) ; see figure [ fig : esc_rates ] .",
    "note that the ordering of the escape rates , for finite - size holes , changes with @xmath86 . at @xmath95 ( corresponding to the unbiased case ) the ordering",
    "is given by the length of the shortest periodic orbit in the holes @xcite .",
    "( colour online ) escape rates for cylinders of length three in the full shift on two symbols @xmath96 with bias @xmath86 . from @xmath97",
    "vertically we have @xmath98 and @xmath99.,width=453,height=340 ]",
    "an additional strength of ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) is that it allows us to study the asymptotic behavior of the escape rate as @xmath100 shrinks to zero around a given point .",
    "consider a periodic point @xmath101 of prime period @xmath86 ( the aperiodic case corresponds to @xmath102 ) .",
    "pick a sequence of shrinking holes defined by words @xmath103 chosen to be @xmath104 concatenated copies of a word @xmath105 .",

    "denote by @xmath109 the measure of the interval defined by @xmath110 .",
    "the correlation polynomial of each @xmath103 is then @xmath111 where we use @xmath112 , @xmath113 and define @xmath114 . for @xmath115 maps @xmath116 corresponds to the stability of the prime periodic orbit of @xmath108 . in order to investigate the asymptotic behavior around @xmath117 we rewrite the smallest zero @xmath118 of ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) in terms of a formal expansion @xmath119 using ( [ eq : corr_per_final ] ) and ( [ eq : g_ep ] ) in ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) along with the fact that @xmath120 for some polynomial @xmath121 from the perron - frobenius theorem , to first order in @xmath122 we have , @xmath123 which gives , @xmath124 in order to make sense of ( [ eq : s1 ] ) we firstly derive an important relationship between the transfer operators of the closed and open systems and the operator @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the return time operator of a set @xmath10 which is defined by @xmath127 similar to the operators defined in @xcite . from ( [ eq : op_op ] ) we have formally @xmath128 we stress that this relation is generic and not restricted to the markov setting investigated so far . on the other hand , in the present markov one , we can show that @xmath129 is the generating function of the probability of return to the hole , while @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath132 @xmath133 is related to the generating function of the probability of first - return @xmath134 via @xcite , @xmath135 using ( [ eq : operator_relation_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : renewal - eq ] ) we explicitly show that the decay rate of the first return time distribution of a set @xmath10 in a closed system , given by the leading pole of @xmath134 , is equal to the escape rate of the system open on @xmath10 ( given by the leading zero of @xmath136 ) , a previously heuristically derived result @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from kac s lemma @xmath137 and thus , using ( [ eq : operator_relation_3 ] ) in ( [ eq : renewal - eq ] ) we have @xmath138 which implies @xmath139 note that for @xmath140 ( corresponding to @xmath108 aperiodic ) we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( equivalently choose @xmath103 to be aperiodic so that @xmath143 for every @xmath104 and the result follows ) .",
    "the first order expansion ( [ firstorder ] ) is consistent with @xcite , wherein it is shown to be valid for more general chaotic maps . on the other hand , using ( [ eq : corr_per_final ] ) and ( [ eq : t_final ] ) one can derive _ all _ orders recursively due to the general form of ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) . of particular note",

    "the appearance of an @xmath149 term is derived for the doubling map in @xcite along with a heuristic argument for why it should be found in a more general setting , as we have confirmed here for the general case of a subshift of finite type .",
    "having an expression for the dynamical zeta function such as equation ( [ eq : zeta_finite_final ] ) has allowed us to analytically derive some properties of the escape rate for a paradigmatic class of dynamical systems . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "we believe that a formal investigation of the accuracy and convergence properties of the proposed framework within the ulam approximation scheme , could permit the extension of some of the results to more general nonlinear systems . in this respect",

    ". moreover , note that the formalism is equally valid in situations where some piecewise constant observable is introduced @xcite or where an infinite countable partition is used as in intermittent maps @xcite .",
