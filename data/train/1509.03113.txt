    "historically , measurements of the coronal white light brightness were restricted to total solar eclipse observations .",
    "polarized brightness measurements , which are dominated by thomson - scattered light from coronal electrons , allowed the inversion of observations to estimate coronal electron densities @xcite .",
    "such inversion methods assume a simple geometry ( spherical or cylindrical ) to the distribution of density , and result in a useful estimate of the overall drop in density with height within streamers or coronal holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are most accurate during solar minimum where the distribution of density is closer to the assumed geometry @xcite .",
    "the rapid development of instrumentation over the past few decades , in particular space - based coronagraphs , allow regular high - cadence observations .",
    "this allows coronal rotational tomography methods to be applied , resulting in estimates of the coronal density distribution without the need to assume a geometry .",
    "that is , the line of sight may be resolved .",
    "a successful tomography method was devised by @xcite , enabling reconstructions even during solar maximum @xcite .",
    "these techniques aim to find a distribution of electron density in a 3d corona which best satisfy a set of coronagraphic _ pb _",
    "observations made over half a solar rotation ( half a rotation since both east and west limbs are observed ) , subject to some reasonable assumptions such as the smoothness of the reconstruction .",
    "these techniques have been applied to very low heights in the corona @xcite , which bodes well for better constraints on large - scale magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models at these heights .",
    "a novel method for creating qualitative maps of the distribution of coronal structure was introduced by @xcite , resulting in a comprehensive study of coronal structure over a solar cycle @xcite and measurements of coronal rotation rates @xcite .",
    "regardless of the tomography method , the accuracy of the reconstructed densities are dependent on both the accuracy of the input data ( calibration and possibly background subtraction uncertainties ) and the amount of available data ( most tomographical methods are limited to using polarized brightness observations in order to avoid the need for background subtraction ) .",
    "it is desirable to use the large archive of total brightness observations for tomography , rather than the far lower number of polarized brightness observations .",
    "@xcite show one method to achieve this .",
    "another major challenge is dealing with changes in the coronal structure over the observational period ( half a solar rotation ) .",
    "currently , with three operational spacecraft observing the corona from different directions , it is in principle possible to reduce the time period needed for a tomographical reconstruction by using the multi - instrument data as input for tomography , but this depends on accurate crosscalibration . a recent work",
    "to discuss calibration and crosscalibration of the available instruments is @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have considerable relevance to this work .",
    "absolute calibration is another issue .",
    "even with good cross - calibration between coronagraphs , a decision must be made as to which instrument is used as a standard .",
    "most works depend on the standard calibration procedures provided by the instrument groups , generally based on pre - flight laboratory measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most advanced absolute calibration is gained by the use of stars observed within the coronagraph fields of view , giving the most precise in - flight calibration over long time periods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "tomographical maps of the coronal density have many useful applications , including coronal rotation rates @xcite , relationships between large - scale coronal structure and solar features @xcite , constraints or comparison with magnetic or mhd models @xcite , for interpreting observations of other instruments @xcite , and for extrapolation into the heliosphere .",
    "large - scale models of the corona and heliosphere would benefit greatly from an additional empirical constraint of density distribution in the extended corona .",
    "reliable crosscalibration of coronagraphs is useful for purposes other than coronal tomography , most notably for coronal mass ejection ( cme ) analysis",
    ". estimates of cme masses contain large uncertainties due to lack of information on their true 3-dimensional distribution , and it is only through correct crosscalibration of coronagraphs viewing from different directions that this may be resolved @xcite . also useful for this type of analysis",
    "are methods for isolating the cme from the background coronal structures @xcite .",
    "a brief introduction to the instruments and observations is in section [ inst ] .",
    "the technique to separate the dynamic and quiescent coronal components is described in section [ dst ] .",
    "calibration of lasco c2 , including background subtraction , is in section [ c2 ] , followed by crosscalibration of lasco c2 and cor2 a ( section [ c2cora ] ) and of cor2 a & b ( section [ cor2ab ] ) .",
    "an overview of how the calibrated data may be utilised in future work is in section [ application ] , and section [ summary ] gives a summary .",
    "the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco , @xcite ) c2 instrument aboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho , @xcite ) has observed the extended inner corona almost continuously since 1996 .",
    "it has an useful field of view of @xmath12.2 to 6.0@xmath0  ( measured from solar disk center ) , collected on a 1024 by 1024 detector ( with occasional onboard rebinning to 512 by 512 ) .",
    "the cleanliness and excellent quality of the data over almost two decades of operation is a testament to the instrument builders and team .",
    "lasco c2 can use several different wide bandpass filters .",
    "this study uses the orange filter exclusively , being by far the most widely used observing filter .",
    "the data is publically available from many sources in the form of standard fits files .",
    "these level 0.5 fits files are images containing the detector counts plus a header which records all the essential observational information ( pointing , dates , exposure times etc . ) .",
    "there is a large set of software to open and process the lasco fits files in the solarsoft library .",
    "lasco c2 makes two types of observations - total brightness ( @xmath2 ) and polarized brightness ( _ pb _ ) .",
    "the _ pb _",
    "observations are made typically once or twice a day , and involve a sequence of observations made using polarizers at varying angles .",
    "these observations may be combined during calibration to form an estimate of the coronal _",
    "pb_. the total brightness observations are made far more frequently , varying from @xmath130 minutes at the start of the mission , up to @xmath110 minutes by 2014 .",
    "typical exposure times are @xmath125s .",
    "lasco c2 @xmath2  images contain three main components : instrumental stray light , the k corona brightness ( @xmath3 ) , and the f corona brightness ( @xmath4 ) , with @xmath4  becoming dominant at heights above @xmath13@xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath4  is the emission of scattered sunlight from interplanetary dust integrated along a line of sight , first described by @xcite .",
    "@xmath3  is thomson - scattered emission from coronal electrons , also integrated along a line of sight @xcite .",
    "isolating the f and k components of brightness from c2 observations is not a trivial matter .",
    "stray light and @xmath4  is largely unpolarized below 6.0@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the _ pb _",
    "images are therefore mostly free of @xmath4 .",
    "this is exploited in this work as a means to create background images of the f - corona and stray light which may be subtracted from the @xmath2  to isolate @xmath3 .",
    "a proper calibration of the _ pb _  images is important . to achieve this",
    ", we use a comparison of star brightness between the _ pb _  and @xmath2  images to obtain in - flight values of corrected calibration factors for the _ pb _  sequences .",
    "the _ pb _  images can subsequently be radiometrically calibrated using published values based of @xmath2  calibration factors , also gained from stars @xcite .",
    "the cor2 coronagraphs , part of the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi , @xcite ) suite of instruments aboard the twin solar terrestial relations observatory ( stereo a & b , @xcite ) , have been observing the corona since 2005 .",
    "they have useful fields of view from @xmath14 - 14@xmath0  collected on a 2048 by 2048 detector . as with lasco",
    ", there is a large set of software to open and process the cor2 fits files in the solarsoft library .",
    "cor2 makes both total brightness ( @xmath2 ) and polarized brightness ( _ pb _ ) sequence observations .",
    "in contrast to lasco c2 , the _ pb _  observations are made far more frequently - typically every half hour or so . in principle , the lasco c2 procedures to create calibrated backgrounds for subtraction from total brightness observations ( described later ) could also be applied to cor2 total brightness observations . in practice",
    ", there is not much to be gained in doing this - _ pb _  observations every half - hour is sufficient time resolution for effective tomography and also for cme analysis , without the complication and uncertainty of additional calibration steps . the standard calibrations ( solarsoft routine secchi_prep.pro ) are applied to the cor2 _ pb _",
    "sequences to obtain _ pb _  images .",
    "these are then transformed into an approximation of @xmath3  using an inversion / integration procedure similar in concept to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite to be described in detail later .",
    "the dynamic separation technique ( dst ) was introduced in concept by @xcite and further developed into a spatio - temporal deconvolution method by @xcite in the context of automated cme detection @xcite .",
    "this section describes an improved method which can be applied to coronagraph data without the steps of background removal and normalizing - radial - graded - filter ( nrgf ) which were used previously . as such",
    ", it is more robust and also serves to remove certain static instrumental errors from the data .",
    "the main purpose of the dst is to split the coronagraph images into two components - the static , quiescent corona ( including f - corona and instrumental background ) and dynamic events .",
    "successful separation of the two components is a very powerful tool for study of both the quiescent corona and cmes or smaller dynamical features @xcite .",
    "it also aids in creating stable background images for subtraction , and is important in achieving reliable calibration as will be shown in following sections .",
    "figure [ figsep]a shows a lasco c2 total brightness observation of 2007/03/12 11:26 , which includes a small cme in the north - east corona .",
    "the image is a standard level 0.5 fits file , normalized by the exposure time and with the image unwarped or distorted to provide the correct observational geometry using the standard lasco procedure c2_warp.pro .",
    "the image is cleaned using a point filter .",
    "the filter iteratively identifies isolated pixels , or small group of pixels , with very large or small brightness compared to the mean and standard deviation of their local region , and replaces their values with the local mean with each iteration .",
    "the image is transformed into polar coordinates , limiting the field of view ( fov ) to heliocentric heights of 2.25 - 6.00@xmath0 .",
    "this polar image is shown in figure [ figsep]b , with 720 position angle bins and 300 height bins .",
    "the rest of the processing and calibration is applied in polar coordinates - it is convenient to work in this coordinate space , particularly for the dst .",
    "the arrow in figure [ figsep]b point to a large instrumental stray light artifact which will be effectively removed by the dst .",
    "the dst works under the assumption that the quiescent corona in the lasco c2 field of view is close to radial ( at least smooth in the radial direction ) , and changes only slowly ( or smoothly ) in time .",
    "dynamic events form localised regions which are not smooth in the radial , and by definition , change rapidly in time . thus applying an iterative deconvolution in the radial and time dimensions , with appropriate choice of smoothing kernels ,",
    "leads to an estimate of a smooth background ( quiescent component ) with the residual forming an estimate of dynamic events ( dynamic component ) .",
    "a box - car kernel of width 0.3@xmath0  in the radial and up to 8 hours in time is used here .",
    "this corresponds to around 24 radial bins and around 45 - 55 observations depending on cadence .",
    "irregular cadence is not a large problem for the method , providing that there are a reasonable number of images in the 8 hour window .",
    "therefore , for our example image of 2007/03/21 11:26 , there are 50 total brightness observations made between 08:26 and 15:26 ( @xmath5 hrs ) .",
    "these are all transformed to the same polar coordinates , forming a datacube in position angle , radial dimension , and time .",
    "an example of a height - time slice , ready for dst processing at position angle 70@xmath6  is shown in figure [ figsep2]c .",
    "the small cme can be seen as two brighter streaks against the background .",
    "the deconvolution is an iterative process .",
    "the first step is a temporary reduction in the radial drop - off in brightness . over the whole data cube ( all position angles and times ) ,",
    "@xmath7 , the median decrease of brightness against height , is calculated .",
    "if @xmath8 is the original polar image , a new image is given by @xmath9 .",
    "initially , the dynamic component @xmath10 is everywhere zero and the initial quiescent component @xmath11 is set equal to @xmath12 . at iteration @xmath13 ( @xmath14 )",
    "the estimate of the dynamic component @xmath15 and the quiescent component @xmath16 are updated by @xmath17 , \\\\",
    "q_{i } = i_r - d_{i } ,   \\label{eqndst}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the radial - time boxcar kernel .",
    "iteration ends when the total absolute difference between subsequent @xmath19 drops below a certain threshold or when @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamic and quiescent components are then multiplied along the radial dimension by @xmath7 , thus reintroducing the radial drop - off in brightness .",
    "this is the main separation routine , and the resulting quiescent images are very clean as shown in figure [ figsep]c .",
    "these seem to be free of any streaks or diffraction patterns near the inner fov . the instrumental error indicated by an arrow in figure [ figsep]b is not present .",
    "diffraction patterns and other instrumental artifacts are present in the dynamic component .",
    "these are easily removed by calculating for each position angle and height bin within the dynamic images the median value over a time range of @xmath21 hours from the time of interest , and subtracting from the current dynamic image .",
    "the result is a set of very clean images containing real dynamic events and no artifacts , as shown in figure [ figsep]d .",
    "figure [ figsep]e shows constant - height cuts across the original , quiescent and dynamic images at a height of 3.5@xmath0 .",
    "whilst figures [ figsep]b - d show the results of the separation process for a single observation , figure [ figsep2 ] shows angle - time and height - time stacks for the cme event of 2007/03/21 .",
    "these figures confirm the cleanliness of the dst and the effective removal of instrumental artifacts .",
    "figure [ figsep2]e shows the height - time quiescent component .",
    "there is a hint of enhanced brightness at the position of the cme in this image which shows that the separation of dynamic and quiescent can not be made perfectly because structures in the quiescent corona move in response to the cme .",
    "a critical choice therefore is the choice of kernel width . a narrower kernel ( in radial and time dimensions )",
    "would enhance smaller - scale features in the dynamic images whilst allowing more of the larger - scale dynamic components into the quiescent images .",
    "the choice of kernel presented here is gained from trial and error for many types of cmes .",
    "what is important is that most of the cme signal is found in the dynamic component whilst we can not avoid a small , smooth change in the quiescent component during the passage of larger cmes which do cause a change in the distribution of quiescent coronal structure .",
    "an identical dst method is applied to the secchi cor2 coronagraphs , with similar results .",
    "figure [ figsep3 ] shows angle - time and height - time stack plots for the same cme event as shown for lasco c2 in figure [ figsep2 ] , but for secchi cor2 a. at this time , soho and stereo a are close , therefore the cme should , and does , appear structurally similar .",
    "what is considerably different , of course , is the actual brightness values .",
    "use of the cor2 polarized brightness sequences allows the separation to be made on the cor2 calibrated data , in units of mean solar brightness ( @xmath22 ) . at this stage of processing ,",
    "the lasco c2 data are not yet calibrated .",
    "comparison of actual brightness values and estimated cme mass is made later in section [ application ] .",
    "except for a few dedicated observational campaigns , _ pb _  measurements are made infrequently by lasco c2 . typically one or two measurements are made per day .",
    "total brightness ( without the polarizers ) are made very often , with a cadence of @xmath120 minutes , increasing to @xmath110 minutes in more recent years ( due to an increasing portion of soho s telemetry as other instruments become non - operational ) . for tomography of the corona , and for properly calibrated measurements of dynamic events , it is important to properly calibrate the total brightness observations .    in this section , the infrequent _ pb _",
    "observations are compared to the total brightness observations and are used as ` tie - points ' to form calibrated backgrounds which may be subtracted from the total brightness observations .",
    "the main steps are :    * converting the _ pb _  observations into @xmath3  values by inversion .",
    "* comparing the @xmath3  images to radiometrically calibrated total brightness images ( the quiescent images gained from the dst ) to form one background image per _ pb _  observation . * creating a final long time - period ( @xmath110 day ) median of the individual background images .",
    "thus quiescent component @xmath2  images may be transformed to our approximation of @xmath3 , by multiplication with a standard radiometric calibration and vignetting image , and subtraction of a long - term background image which contains stray light and @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting calibrated total brightness images are shown to agree well with the @xmath3  values gained from the _ pb _  observations , as should be expected given the procedure . before describing the procedure , the following section uses observations of stars to obtain new calibration factors for the _ pb _  observations .",
    "the calibration of lasco c2 total brightness observations has been made using a detailed study of star brightness , providing a calibration factor of low uncertainty which changes linearly over time @xcite . in this section",
    ", the brightness of stars is compared between the @xmath2  and _ pb _  observations of lasco c2 , providing a new inflight calibration factor for the _ pb _  observations .",
    "the stars are also used to test the lasco c2 @xmath2  flat field , or vignetting , correction .",
    "this analysis is based on the assumption that the collected star light is largely unpolarized , which is a valid assumption based on works of stellar astronomy ( see table 1 of @xcite , and references within their introduction ) .      from year 2000 to 2015 , all lasco c2 @xmath2  observations using the orange filter are processed to identify and isolate the signal from bright points .",
    "point - like features are revealed by subtracting a median - filtered image , with sliding window of width @xmath23 pixels .",
    "this is applied to the raw level 0.5 fits files .",
    "such a high - pass image is shown in figure [ testmedian2]a .",
    "the choice of sliding window size is important .",
    "too small would risk discarding pixels containing star signal . as the sliding window size",
    "is increased , then more of the background coronal structures are included .",
    "for example , some faint rays at the boundaries of bright streamers can be seen in figure [ testmedian2]a .",
    "figure [ testmedian ] shows how the choice of sliding window size can effect the measured brightness for point - like objects in an image .",
    "figure [ testmedian]a shows the mean fractional difference between brightnesses for all point - like objects in a lasco c2 image as the size of the sliding window is increased from 3 to 19 pixels squared . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "the brightness for the largest sliding window is taken as the standard , or target .",
    "our choice of 11 pixels squared is a sensible compromise to avoid ` leakage ' from background coronal structure , and to preserve the desired brightness .",
    "this is confirmed by figures [ testmedian]b - e which show cuts across several bright pixels for sliding windows of size 3 , 11 , and 19 pixels . as expected",
    ", there is a large difference between the smallest window and the others , whilst the 11 and 19 pixel - squared windows are almost identical .",
    "the point features are automatically identified in the high - pass image by setting a threshold of @xmath24 counts / second , thus creating a binary mask with values of 1 containing the brightest points , above the threshold .",
    "stars may have signal spread over more than one pixel , so that pixels neighbouring the brightest pixel are lower than the threshold .",
    "to allow for this , the binary image is convolved with a narrow gaussian kernel , and all pixels with value greater than a very small number in the smoothed binary image , and value @xmath25 3 times the local median absolute deviation in the high - pass image , are finally identified as pixels which may contain signal from stars . in this way , if pixels contain significant counts , and are close to the brightest pixels , they are included in the final estimate of brightness .",
    "the black pixels in figure [ testmedian2]b are the pixels identified as potential stars .",
    "many of these pixels are grouped together in small numbers .",
    "finally , each candidate pixel , or group of pixels , is recorded as a single point , as shown in figure [ testmedian]c .",
    "the brightness of each point is given by the total brightness of all pixels in each group , and its position given by the mean @xmath26 and @xmath27 of all pixels in the group , weighted by their brightness .",
    "groups too close to the occulting disk are discarded .",
    "the recording of bright pixels is repeated throughout the @xmath115 years of images .",
    "all bright pixels are recorded , stars or otherwise . by use of a hough transform ,",
    "first in space coordinates , then in time , all bright points which do not move through images in time as one would expect stars to move , are discarded .",
    "so bright pixels describing straight lines in the image @xmath28 coordinates , and also at the required slope in @xmath29 coordinates , and containing a decent amount of points , are identified as stars .",
    "the tracks of stars in both space and time are shown in figure [ startracks]a and b respectively for a period of two weeks in january 2007 .",
    "note that the filtering method is effective at identifying the track of a star even across the occulter , and of grouping points according to star .",
    "the time - normalized counts of each star track is shown as a function of image-@xmath30 in figure [ startracks]c .",
    "short periods of time bridging spacecraft rotation manoeuevres force gaps of a few days in the identification and grouping process .",
    "the first useful application of the tracks of stars over a long time period is as a check on the lasco c2 flatfield , or vignetting , correction .",
    "this correction is provided in the standard c2 calibration routines within the solarsoft routines as the fits file _",
    "c2vig_final.fts_. each star shows a well - behaved variation in brightness as it crosses the c2 field of view , as can be seen in figure [ startracks]c .",
    "this variation shows the response of the instrument to a constant signal .",
    "each star track s brightness is normalized by its 99 percentile maximum ( i.e. robust maximum ) .",
    "these normalized values are then collected for large bins across the whole image .",
    "for each bin , a robust mean and standard deviation is calculated .",
    "for the robust mean , values larger than twice the median absolute deviation from the median are discarded , and a mean calculated for the remaining values .",
    "this results in an estimate of the flat field across the whole image barring heights close to , or within , the occulter .",
    "there is a potential flaw in this procedure in the assumption that each star s track maximum coincides with a maximum in the flat field .",
    "this assumption is valid for c2 given the circular form of the flat field and that the vast majority of star tracks extend across the whole image , and must therefore pass through some maximum point in the flat field .",
    "the star flat field is compared to the standard c2 correction for the whole field of view in figure [ flatfield ] , and plotted for a variety of cuts across the image in figure [ flatfield2 ] .",
    "the standard flat field falls within the margins of error of the estimated star flat field across most of the image .",
    "small regions of disagreement coincide with regions where the star values have a large variation - often near the occulter . based on this analysis ,",
    "the standard c2 flatfield provided by the instrument team in solarsoft is reliable , and will be used with confidence in the remainder of this work .",
    "all _ pb _  observation made by lasco c2 in years 2000 - 2015 with the orange filter is used in this analysis .",
    "each file is examined for point - like features following the procedures described above for the @xmath2  observations ( figure [ testmedian2 ] ) , but with a suitably low brightness threshold for each polarizer position , and a reduced - size sliding window median filter which is discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "the position and observation time of each detected point - like feature is then compared to the tracks of stars identified in the @xmath2  observations .",
    "this is achieved by fitting the spatial position of each @xmath2  star track to a straight line .",
    "the expected position of each star at the time of the _ pb _  observation is then compared to the position of detected points in the _ pb _  image .",
    "if the distance is less than 1 pixel , the bright _ pb _  point is considered a star , and its brightness can be directly compared to the brightness of the star in the @xmath2  observations . to achieve this",
    ", the brightness of the @xmath2  star track is fitted to a @xmath31 degree polynomial , as a function of the @xmath30-pixel position across the image .",
    "this allows interpolation to the time of the _ pb _  observation , and a cleaner estimate of the expected brightness ( in comparison to taking the brightness of the nearest neighbour , for example ) .",
    "finally , the ratio of the _ pb _  brightness to the estimated @xmath2  brightness is recorded .",
    "one important source of systematic error is the influence of different pixel scales on the pixel identification routine and the resulting relative brightness between pixel groups .",
    "most _ pb _",
    "images have twice the plate scale of the @xmath2 , that is , the _ pb _",
    "images are of size @xmath32 whilst the @xmath2  images are @xmath33 . to allow for this , the procedures for isolating and identifying bright points in the _ pb _  images use a sliding window median of 5 pixels squared ( rather than the 11 pixels squared of the @xmath2  images ) .",
    "this correction to the procedure still has a potential of introducing a systematic error .",
    "this is tested by detecting points in many @xmath2  images , then rebinning the same images to size @xmath32 and applying the _ pb _  detection procedures .",
    "a histogram of the brightness ratio of detected points between the original and rebinned images is shown in figure [ testimagerebin ] .",
    "the distribution is very strongly peaked at 1 , with a median absolute deviation of 4% , validating the choice of sliding window size .",
    "figure [ disppb ] show histograms of the ratio of the star s brightness in _ pb _  compared to @xmath2 , over years 2000 - 2015 .",
    "note that high thresholds ( which results in only the brightest stars being used for this part of the analysis ) , and the stringent criteria for associating bright points in _ pb _  images to star tracks in @xmath2  images ( distance of less than 1 pixel ) has resulted in a relatively low number of stars .",
    "the median and median absolute deviations of ratios over all time for each polarizer state are listed in table [ tablepb ] .",
    "the errors are around 5% .",
    "these calibration factors differ only a little from the standard values used in the solarsoft procedures , which are also listed in table [ tablepb ] .",
    "the solarsoft values are all within the margin of errors of the star values .",
    "note also the small difference in calibration factor for the 0@xmath6  polarizer position compared to the other two angles , although this is still within the margin of errors .",
    ".correction factors for the lasco c2 polarizer observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , this section provides a method which forces the cor2 b _ pb _",
    "observations to closely match those of cor2 a. to correct cor2 b at a given height and position angle , the individual polarizer images are multiplied by the appropriate @xmath34 factors , and a value is subtracted according to equation [ subfact ] and the parameters of table [ corab_table ] . the good agreement ( e.g. figure [ corab]c )",
    "is not surprising given the creation of the subtraction factor .",
    "this however is the major flaw in the method - it is not based on a simple adjustment or a single calibration factor for each polarizer angle .",
    "there are different calibration factors at different heights , as well as a complicated subtraction factor which also differs with height .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether the problems associated with the cor2 b instrument are stable over time , and whether our solution is valid over long time periods .",
    "paper slowromancap2@  will address this issue by comparing tomography results from the three coronagraphs at different times during their missions .",
    "the primary purpose of developing the dst and calibration methods is for use in coronal rotation tomography . in paper slowromancap2@",

    "this height is chosen as an optimal height for the tomography method and as a height where effective crosscalibration may be applied .",
    "the important parts of the processing and calibration methods presented here are the reduction of signal of large cmes by the dst , the conversion of lasco c2 total brightness observations into an approximation of @xmath3 , and the crosscalibration between coronagraphs .",

    "the structural agreement between the two is excellent .",
    "there are regions of unphysically low density within and neighbouring the streamer belts in both maps .",
    "this has always been a problem of coronal rotational tomography .",
    "it is likely caused both by time variation of the high - density , bright streamers and an artifact of the method itself and will be addressed in paper slowromancap2@. the lasco c2 reconstruction appears smoother and cleaner because a larger number of observations are available for the reconstruction .",
    "the comparison of tomography maps made by different coronagraphs enables an interesting test of the reliability of the tomography .",
    "there is reasonable numerical agreement between the reconstructed densities , as shown in figure [ tomo2]a .",
    "the most probable density ( corresponding to the large polar coronal holes ) is @xmath35@xmath36 , and the streamers are @xmath37@xmath36 , agreeing well with values found by others @xcite .",
    "the distribution of densities agree well between the two coronagraphs , which is to be expected given the good agreement in brightness following the calibration method .",
    "figure [ tomo2]b shows the distribution of absolute fractional differences over all map pixels .",
    "the agreement is reasonable with 67%  of pixels agreeing within 38%  or less .",
    "combining the data from two or three coronagraphs viewing the corona from different angles enables a reconstruction to be made using a shorter time period of observations .",
    "this enables an improved reconstruction because any changes in the coronal structure will have a lesser impact .",
    "it also helps in analysing temporal changes in coronal structure .",
    "the brief results shown here show promise that such an approach is possible .",
    "a full description of the tomography method and results will be presented in paper slowromancap2@  and paper slowromancap3@.      the calibrated data may be used to gain useful 3d information on the spatial distribution of cmes , and an estimate of their mass .",
    "the dst processing is a crucial part of this study because it allows study of the cme in absence of the background structures , and without the difficulty of interpreting time - differenced images .",
    "figure [ cme1 ] shows the estimated mass as a function of time for the north - east cme of 2007/03/21 shown earlier in the context of dst processing . for calibrating the dynamic component dst images , there is no background subtraction since the static background has already been removed .",
    "the only calibrating factors therefore are the multiplicative ones . assuming that the emitting electrons are solely in the plane of sky , the masses are gained by simple inversion .",
    "the best estimate found for the cme mass in lasco c2 is @xmath38 g .",
    "the masses found by the cor2 a&b coronagraphs are 5.93 and @xmath39 g respectively .",
    "there are several reasons for this difference .",
    "the used lasco c2 field of view is restricted compared to the cor2s , although if the field of view is smaller we would expect the mass estimate to be lower rather than higher .",
    "another , more physical , and potentially useful source of the difference is the true spatial distribution of the cme .",
    "the fact that the three profiles peak at slightly different times suggest that the cme is not in the plane of sky .",
    "the lasco c2 profile is expected to be shifted due to the different height range , but there is also a small shift between the cor2 . in principle , this shift and the different estimated masses may be used to constrain the true longitudinal position of the cme .",
    "this will be studied in a future work .",
    "the most worrying discrepancy is between the coordinated data analysis workshop ( cdaw , @xcite ) cme catalog estimate of mass , @xmath40 g , which is almost three times our estimate .",
    "the standard estimate is based on identifying the region of interest in time - differenced c3 images .",
    "the inversion method steps are identical ( i.e. plane - of - sky approximation , and identical forms of the thomson - scattering electron emission model )",
    ". the difference should not be so high because the whole cme in this example is contained within the lasco c2 field of view at the time of peak mass ( i.e. the cme is not partially measured due to being too large to fit in the field of view ) .",
    "we believe one reason is the movement of background streamers in reaction to the passing of a cme .",
    "note in figure [ figsep2]b how the existing background streamer increases in width due to the passage of the cme . often with large cmes ,",
    "the streamer will split into two for a short period .",
    "this change is not contaminating the separated dynamic image of [ figsep2]c therefore is not included in the cme mass estimate .",
    "time - differencing , however , would include changes in the configuration of the background corona in the estimate of cme mass .",
    "this , and other aspects , will be investigated in a future work .",
    "a potential application of the calibration methods will be the use of the calibrated backgrounds to estimate the f - corona brightness .",
    "the f - corona brightness @xmath4  gives information on the composition and spatial distribution of interplanetary dust , and the influence of the sun on the dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a comprehensive review of interplanetary dust and the f corona can be found in @xcite , and references within . as seen in figure [ testlt ] ,",
    "there are instrumental features in the background which may be identified and removed by taking advantage of the regular spacecraft roll manoevers .",
    "this would leave a smooth background which is probably dominated by the f - corona brightness .",
    "this part of the signal is interesting as an unique measurement of the dust emission close to the sun .",
    "a former study has shown that the dust emission changes little if at all between solar minimum and maximum @xcite , with implications for the interaction of the plasma with dust .",
    "variations in the f - corona over smaller timescales ( days or weeks ) is more difficult to interpret because any rapid changes are probably suspect - they would probably be due to contamination by @xmath3 .",
    "we are interested in processing and studying the lasco c2 background images in order to extend the temporal study of @xcite , and to study the large - scale structure of the dust , possibly using tomography and a model of dust emission .",
    "this study focuses on heights of overlap of the secchi cor2 and lasco c2 coronagraphs , namely @xmath14.1 - 6.0@xmath0 , and focuses closely on a height of 5.0@xmath0  as this will be used as a basis for tomography in paper slowromancap2@. the paper also concentrates on a period of a few weeks in 2007/03 . at this time , the three spacecraft were close together and making regular observations , and the corona was in a quiet state , giving an ideal time for crosscalibration .      *",

    "the long - term backgrounds are shown to be very stable with the largest oscillations in brightness with periods matching the soho orbit , and a smaller oscillation linked to the coronal rotation . following this conversion , the @xmath3  images gained from the highest - cadence",

    "the crosscalibration is good for the time period 2007/03 , and paper slowromancap2@  will use tomography results to establish whether the cross - calibration is dependable at other times .",
    "an important assumption made is the use of lasco c2 as a standard , against which the other coronagraphs are adjusted .",

    "the main weakness is the limited field of view where the cross - calibration method is reliable .",

    "this would provide a far greater overlap of field of view with secchi cor2 .",
    "this is more difficult than the methods presented here for lasco c2 since the f - corona becomes increasingly polarized at heights above @xmath16@xmath0 , and is more difficult in practice due to lower signal to noise and spatial resolution .    in paper slowromancap2@  and slowromancap3@ ,",
