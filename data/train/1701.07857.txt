    "topology is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes and maps among them . from the algebraic definition of topology a new set of algorithms",
    "have been derived .",
    "these algorithms are identified with `` computational topology '' or often pointed out as topological data analysis ( tda ) and are used for investigating high - dimensional data in a quantitative manner .",
    "persistent homology appears as a fundamental tool in topological data analysis .",
    "it studies the evolution of @xmath0-dimensional holes along a sequence @xmath2 of simplicial complexes .",
    "the persistence barcode @xmath3 of @xmath2 is the collection of bars ( i.e. intervals ) representing birth and death times of @xmath0-dimensional holes along such sequence . in @xmath3 , @xmath0-dimensional holes with short lifetimes",
    "are informally considered to be `` topological noise '' , and those with long lifetimes are `` topological features '' of the given data .",
    "persistent homology based techniques are nowadays widely used for analyzing high dimensional data - set and they are good tools for shaping these data - set and for understanding the meaning of the shapes .",
    "persistent homology reveals the global structure of a data - set and it is a powerful tool for dealing with high dimensional data - set without performing dimensionality reduction .",
    "there are several techniques for building a topological space from the data .",
    "the main approach is to complete the data to a collection of combinatorial objects , i.e. simplices .",
    "a nested collection of simplices forms a simplicial complex .",
    "simplicial complexes can be obtained from graphs and point cloud data ( pcd )  @xcite .",
    "for example , pcd can be completed to simplicial complexes by using the vietoris - rips filtration , which is a sequence of simplicial complexes built on a metric space , providing in this way a topological structure to an otherwise disconnected set of points .",
    "it is widely used in tda because it encodes useful information about the topology of the underlying metric space .",
    "let us take a look at fig .",
    "[ fig_rna ] , it represents a collection of rna secondary sub - optimal structures within different bacteria .",
    "all the shapes are characterized by several circular substructures , each of them is obtained by linking different nucleotides .",
    "each substructure encodes functional properties of the bacteria .",
    "mamuye et al .",
    "@xcite used vietoris - rips complexes and persistent homology for certifying that there are different species but characterized with the same rna sub - optimal secondary structure , thus these species are functionally equivalent .",
    "the mathematical details of vietoris - rips filtration are given in section [ topology ] of this paper .    nevertheless , vietoris - rips based analysis suffers of the selection of the parameter @xmath4 . generally speaking , for different @xmath4 , different topological features can be observed .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , several applications of vietoris - rips based analysis to biological problems have been reported and examples of different @xmath4 with different meaning were found . in order to select the best @xmath4 , some statistics have been provided what is known as `` persistence landscape ''  @xcite .",
    "landscape is a powerful tool for statistically assessing the global shape of the data over different @xmath4 . technically speaking",
    ", a landscape is a piecewise linear function that basically maps a point within a persistent diagram ( or barcode ) to a point in which the @xmath5-coordinate is the average parameter value over which the feature exists , and the @xmath6-coordinate is the half - life of the feature . landscape analysis allows to identify topological features . in section  [ entropy ] , we present the notion of persistent entropy , as an alternative approach to landscape .",
    "the main difference between landscape and our method is that the former uses the average of @xmath4 , while the latter works directly on fixed @xmath4 . more concretely ,",
    "persistent entropy ( which is the shannon entropy of the persistence barcode ) is a tool formally defined in @xcite and used to measure similarities between two persistence barcodes .",
    "a precursor of this definition was given in @xcite to measure how different the bars of a barcode are in length .",
    "in @xcite , persistent entropy is used for addressing the comparison between discrete piecewise linear functions . in section [ sec : entropy_rips ] , several properties of the persistent entropy of vietoris - rips filtrations are presented .",
    "for example , the exact formula of maximum and minimum persistent entropy is given for a persistence barcode , fixing the number of bars and the maximum and minimum length .",
    "these results are important later in section [ method ] for differentiate topological features from noise .",
    "in general , `` very '' long living bars ( long lifetime ) are considered topological features since they are stable to `` small '' changes in the filtration . in @xcite",
    "a methodology is presented for deriving confidence sets for persistence diagrams to separate topological noise from topological features .",
    "the authors focused on simple , synthetic examples as proof of concept .",
    "their methods have a simple visualization : one only needs to add a band around the diagonal of the persistence diagram .",
    "points in the band are consistent with being noise .",
    "the first three methods in that paper were based on the distance function to the data .",
    "they started with a sample from a distribution @xmath7 supported on a topological space @xmath8 .",
    "the bottleneck distance was used as a metric on the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "the last method in that paper used density estimation .",
    "the advantage of the former was that it is more directly connected to the raw data .",
    "the advantage of the latter was that it is less fragile ; that is , it is more robust to noise and outliers . in section [ method ] in this paper ,",
    "we derive a simple method for separating topological features from noise of a given filtration using the mentioned persistent entropy measurement .",
    "moreover , we claim it is very easy ( and fast ) to compute , and easy to adapt depending on the application . a preliminary version of this technique was also presented in @xcite .",
