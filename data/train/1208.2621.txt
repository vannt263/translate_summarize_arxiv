    "the bifurcation of limit cycles by perturbing a planar system which has a continuous family of _ cycles _ , i.e. periodic orbits , has been an intensively studied phenomenon ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",

    "the classical and generalized linard systems appear very often in several branches of science and engineering , as biology , chemistry , mechanics , electronics , etc .",

    "in particular linard systems are frequent specially in physiological processes , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in addition , the family of generalized polynomial linard systems is one of the most considered families in the study of limit cycles , see @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . for a small enough @xmath7 ,",

    "if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath16 ; hence we only write @xmath17 .",
    "the main problem concerning @xmath12 is finding its exact value .    we know from @xcite that @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 $ ] denotes the integer part function .",
    "moreover , by following ( * ? ? ?",
