    "a remarkable capability of scanning probe microscopy is the possibility to form and control different ( meta-)stable charged states of single atoms and molecules adsorbed on thin insulating films supported by a metal substrate @xcite .",
    "these charged states can be manipulated and characterized on the atomic scale by scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite and kelvin probe force microscopy ( kpfm ) @xcite .",
    "charged states in molecular adsorbates are formed either by electron attachment to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) or hole attachment to the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) @xcite .",
    "control over the occupancy of frontier molecular states is crucial to alter selectively the catalytic properties of single adsorbates .",
    "such a capability plays a decisive role in the field of molecular electronics , for example , where the ultimate goal is to use single molecules as functional building blocks for switches , rectifiers , transistors and memory @xcite    charge states of adsorbates can be stabilised either by having a sufficently large polarization of the ionic film and the metal substrate or a sufficiently long lifetime using a sufficiently thick film to increase their life time .",
    "for example , the au anion adsorbed on a nacl bilayer is stabilized by the large polarization of the ionic film and the metal substrate  @xcite , whereas in the case of a pentacene molecule adsorbed on this bilayer , this polarization is neither sufficently large to stabilize the anion or the cation@xcite . in contrast , for pentacene molecule on nacl films thicker than 13 monolayers ( ml ) , the electron transfer through the film is quenched and the life time is sufficiently large so that both the cation and the anion become stable on the time scale of the experiments @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the energies of frontier molecular orbitals is found to depend on film thickness .",
    "in fact , scanning tunneling spectroscopy of ultra - thin films ( @xmath0 3ml ) and afm experiments of thick films ( @xmath1 20ml ) showed that the homo - lumo gap of adsorbed pentacene increases with increasing the film thickness , but this gap was always smaller than its value in gas phase .",
    "this behaviour calls for calculations to gain a deeper insight into the interplay between metal substrate and film thickness in determining the energies of the frontier orbitals of the molecular adsorbates .    in principle , the electron and hole attachment energies which determine , for instance , the observed homo - lumo gap of molecular adsorbates can not simply be computed using ground state density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , and an excited - state theory such as the gw approximation is required  @xcite .",
    "however , gw calculations are very expensive for typical molecular adsorbates @xcite and have so far only been applied to a co molecule adsorbed on nacl films supported by a semi - conductor @xcite .    for adsorbates on thin insulating films supported by a metal substrate",
    "even the computation of ground state energies for stable charged states can be very challenging at the dft level @xcite due to the charge - delocalisation error introduced by current exchange - correlation functionals @xcite .",
    "this error often leads to fractional charging , a problem which sometimes can be eliminated using a dft+u approach @xcite .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the calculation of multiply charged states of ag adatoms  @xcite .",
    "a simplifying feature of this class of system is the insulating character of the ionic film , which significantly reduces the coupling of the adsorbate electronic states with the metal electronic states , and forms the basis for approximate schemes @xcite .",
    "this weak coupling was considered previously in dft calculations of electron attachment energies to vacancy states in a nacl bilayer on a cu surface by constraining the vacancy state to be occupied @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed an approximate method where the metal electrons are eliminated completely but the ionic film and the adsorbate are treated fully within dft @xcite .",
    "the metal is simply replaced by a perfect conductor ( pc ) model and the remaining non - hartree interactions between the metal substrate and the film are modelled by a simple force field ( ff ) whose parameters are obtained from full dft calculations of the ionic film supported by the metal substrate . by construction ,",
    "this new method ( dft - pc - ff ) makes it possible to control the charge state of the adsorbate with a large reduction of the computational time .",
    "this method was applied successfully to the calculation of the au anion on a nacl bilayer supported by a cu substrate @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show how dft - pc - ff simulations can be used to compute the energies of frontier molecular orbitals of adsorbates on insulating films supported by a metal substrate . as an example , we consider pentacene adsorbed on nacl films of different thicknesses which are supported by a cu substrate . in agreement with experiments , we find that the homo - lumo gap increases with increasing number of nacl layers .",
    "in addition , our findings are compared with the results from a simple dielectric model of the adsorbed film with abrupt interfaces .",
    "we show that this simplified model is able to semi - quantitatively describe the variation of the homo - lumo gap with film thickness but has also some shortcomings .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : dft - pc ] we describe the main ingredients of the dft - pc - ff method and its application to the calculation of electron and hole attachment energies to an adsorbed molecule and the corresponding homo - lumo gap .",
    "computational details are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp_methods ] .",
    "results for the electronic structure and the homo - lumo energy gap for the isolated molecule are presented in section [ subsec : isomol ] .",
    "results for the variation of this energy gap of an adsorbed pentacene molecule on nacl films with the number of layers are presented and compared with experiments in section [ sec : geo - ene ] . in this latter section",
    "we also compare the calculated and experimnental energy gaps with the results from a simple dielectric model in order to elucidate the contributions from the film and the metal substrate .",
    "finally , some conclusing remarks of this work are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "electrostatic units are used throughout in this paper .",
    "the dft - pc - ff method for the calculations of charged adsorbates on an ionic insulating film supported by a metal substrate has been described in detail in our previous work @xcite . here , we just summarise the key points of this method and how it can be used to calculate the electron and hole attachment energies to an adsorbed molecule and the corresponding homo - lumo gap .    in the dft - pc - ff method ,",
    "the electrons of the metal substrate are not explicitly included in the calculation but their screening is accounted for in a perfect conductor ( pc ) model .",
    "the residual non - hartree interactions between the film and metal substrate are described by a force field ( ff ) .",
    "the system is represented in a supercell with a prescribed total charge @xmath2 of the adsorbate and film , which is compensated by an induced charge @xmath3 in the pc , so that the supercell is neutral .",
    "the total energy @xmath4 of the system is then given in this method by minimising the following energy functional @xmath5=\\bar{e}_\\mathrm{pc}[n_{s}]- \\frac{q_{s}}{e}\\phi_\\mathrm{pc}+\\sum_{k\\in\\mathrm{fl}}\\phi_{k}(z_{k})\\label{eq : e_pc - ff - def}\\ ] ] with respect to the electron density @xmath6 of the adsorbate and the film under the constraint that the total charge of the electrons and the ions is @xmath2 . here ,",
    "@xmath7 $ ] is the energy functional of the adsorbate and the film system interacting with the pc and @xmath8 is the effective work function . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference between @xmath8 and the workfunction @xmath9 of the film supported by the explicit metal substrate ( with no absorbate ) is due to the overlap of the electron density of the film with the image plane in the pc model .",
    "this overlap gives rise to a potential difference between the pc plane and the vacuum level .",
    "the residual non - hartree interactions between the film and metal substrate are described by a simple force - field ( ff ) based on non - polarisable pair potentials , @xmath10 which only depends on the perpendicular distance @xmath11 between the ions @xmath12 in the first layer of the film and the image plane .",
    "besides the atom kinds of the adsorbate and the films , the material specific parameters in the dft - pc - ff method are the position @xmath13 of the image plane in the pc model with respect to the metal surface plane , the effective work function @xmath8 and the pair potentials in the ff .",
    "how these parameters were determined is described in section [ sec : comp_methods ] .    in scanning tunneling spectroscopy and afm experiments , the bias voltages corresponding to attaching a tunneling electron or hole to the adsorbate",
    "are determined by the transition energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 for attaching an electron or a hole from the fermi level to the adsorbate at fixed ion - core positions , respectively . in the dft - pc - ff method",
    "these energies are approximated by the following vertical transition energies @xmath16 where the energies of the negatively charged state @xmath17 and positively charged state @xmath18 are obtained at the calculated equilibrium geometry for the molecule in its ground state with charge @xmath19 .",
    "note that in the presence of a metal support these charge states are not electronic ground states but are resonances due to mixing with metallic states .",
    "however , this mixing is already very weak , for instance , for a pentacene molecule adsorbed on a nacl bilayer due to its insulating character , resulting in very narrow resonances with an estimated broadening of a few hundreds of an @xmath20ev @xcite .",
    "thus , the ground state energies obtained by neglecting this mixing should be an excellent approximation to these resonance energies .",
    "since the system is represented in a supercell , the computed results are expected to depend on the surface area or coverage due to electrostatic adsorbate - adsorbate interactions .",
    "thus , it is necessary to correct @xmath21 and @xmath15 for the dipole - dipole interactions between periodic images , as described in [ app : dipcorr ] .",
    "if the adsorbed molecule is neutral ( @xmath22 ) as for the adsorbed pentace molecule then the homo - lumo gap can be obtained from the vertical transition energies @xmath21 and @xmath15 as follows @xmath23 note that this result for @xmath24 is independent of the ( effective ) work function @xmath8 of the metal and the film . for a reference ,",
    "the corresponding homo - lumo gap for an isolated neutral molecule , @xmath25 , was also calculated from the vertical affinity @xmath26 and ionisation energies @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total energy of the isolated molecule with a net charge of @xmath30 in the equilibrium geometry of the neutral molecule .",

    "the nacl bilayer supported by a cu(100 ) substrate was modelled using a slab in a supercell . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , each primitive surface unit cell was composed of four layers of cu atoms with nine cu atoms in each layer , and a nacl film that contained four atoms of each species in each layer .",
