    "it is a fundamental question in standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) of what type of restrictions the schrdinger evolution imposes on the behavior in time of basic objects . in particular , it is of interest to ask if sqm allows for self - adjoint operators having the so - called lyapunov property , that is , monotonicity of the expectation value irrespective of the initial state of the system .",
    "clearly , such an operator would indicate the direction of time .",
    "a natural candidate for a self - adjoint lyapunov operator is a ( self - adjoint ) time operator @xmath0 canonically conjugate to the hamiltonian @xmath1 , such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 form an imprimitivity system @xcite ( implying that each generates a translation on the spectrum of the other ) .",
    "however , a well known theorem of pauli tells us that this is impossible @xcite .",
    "recently , galapon attempted to bypass pauli s arguments and found pairs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying the canonical commutation relations , but do not constitute an imprimitivity system @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath0 operator obtained in this way does not have the lyapunov property .",
    "other authors do not insist on the conjugacy of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this context , unruh and wald s proof that a ` monotonically perfect clock ' does not exist @xcite should be noted , as well as misra , prigogine , and courbage s no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "still another solution , advocated by some authors , is to do away with the requirement of self - adjointness @xcite .",
    "a lypaunov self - adjoint operator acting within the framework of standard quantum mechanics was recently introduced in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study some of its properties .",
    "in particular , we derive its spectrum and generalized eigenstates , and treat the example of the free particle .",
    "let @xmath2 be a separable hilbert space and let @xmath1 be a self - adjoint operator generating a unitary evolution group @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , on @xmath2 .",
