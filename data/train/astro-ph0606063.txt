    "groups of galaxies constitute the most common galaxy associations , containing as many as 5070% of all galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are , therefore , an important laboratory for studying the processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution . in recent years",
    ", optical and x - ray studies of groups at low redshift have provided new insights into these important systems . in particular , there are strong correlations between the morphological composition of the luminous galaxies , the velocity dispersion , and the presence of x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "specifically , diffuse x - ray emission is found almost exclusively in those groups dominated by early - type galaxies . in turn , the early - type fraction is strongly correlated with the group velocity dispersion and , thus , the group mass .    in the most luminous x - ray groups , the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) is always a very massive elliptical , located at the peak of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "as the peak of the x - ray emission is likely coincident with the center of the group , this implies that the bgg lies at the center of the group potential . indeed",
    ", the position of the bgg is also indistinguishable from the center of the group potential as defined by the mean velocity and projected spatial distribution of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fact that the bgg is located at the center of the potential suggests the formation of the bgg is intimately linked to the formation and evolution of the group itself .",
    "given their relatively low velocity dispersions , groups of galaxies provide ideal sites for galaxy - galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "this implies that significant changes in the star formation rates and morphological appearance of galaxies may be occurring in groups . to better understand how galaxies evolve in the group environment ,",
    "groups must be observed over a wide range of cosmic time .",
    "however , observations of groups at even moderate redshifts have been limited because of the difficulty of finding groups given their low galaxy densities . @xcite",
    "photometrically selected a sample of groups at intermediate redshifts by targeting known radio galaxies .",
    "their study suggested a progressive bluing in the galaxy population .",
    "small samples of groups at higher redshifts have also been found in deep redshift surveys @xcite and around lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "the recent completion of very large redshifts surveys now allow large group samples to be kinematically - defined from moderate redshifts up to z @xmath0 1 @xcite .",
    "wilman et al .",
    "( 2005a , b ) studied a large sample of groups at moderate redshifts selected from the cnoc2 survey and found that the fraction of group members undergoing significant star formation increases strongly with redshift out to z @xmath0 0.5 .",
    "therefore , there is evidence for some evolution in the group environment in the last @xmath0 5 billion years at least among optically - selected group samples .",
    "x - ray emission from the hot intragroup medium provides another way to identify candidate groups at high redshifts .",
    "_ rosat _ was the first x - ray telescope capable of finding such systems and large numbers of group candidates at intermediate redshifts were found in deep surveys with this telescope @xcite .",
    "the rosat surveys suggest there is little or no evolution of the x - ray luminosity function of groups and poor clusters out to at least z=0.5 .",
    "more recently , @xcite arrived at a similar conclusion using twelve groups and clusters from the early data taken as part of the _ xmm _ large - scale structure ( lss ) survey . upon completion",
    ", the xmm - lss survey will provide a large sample of x - ray selected groups and poor clusters out to redshifts of z @xmath0 0.6 or higher .    in this paper ,",
    "we provide the first results from an extensive multi - wavelength study of nine x - ray selected galaxy groups and poor clusters in the redshift range 0.2 @xmath2 z @xmath2 0.6 selected from deep _ rosat pspc _ pointings .",
    "our data allow the first detailed look at the morphological composition of x - ray groups at intermediate redshifts .",
    "a detailed study of the x - ray properties of six of these systems based on _ xmm - newton _ observations is provided in a companion paper ( jeltema et al . 2006 ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath3 cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath4@xmath5=0.27 , @xmath3=0.73 , and h@xmath6=70 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 throughout this paper .",
    "we select our intermediate redshift group candidates from the _ rosat _ deep cluster survey ( rdcs ; @xcite ) . as the deepest of the rosat pointing surveys , the rdcs is the best suited for selecting low luminosity systems ( i.e. groups ) at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the rdcs used a wavelet - based technique to search for extended sources in deep _ rosat pspc _ pointings .",
    "a full description of the x - ray analysis and object selection technique is provided in @xcite . to identify the poorest galaxy systems in the rdcs , we restrict our sample to objects with x - ray luminosities between @xmath0 2 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath0 2 @xmath7 10@xmath9 in the 0.52 kev band .",
    "this corresponds to the range of nearby x - ray luminous groups @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in moderate redshift groups , we further restrict our sample to objects at z @xmath10 0.2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of redshifts and x - ray luminosities for rdcs groups as defined above .",
    "the majority of the systems are at the low redshift end ( 0.2 @xmath2 z @xmath2 0.3 ) as is expected from a flux - limited x - ray survey . however ,",
    "for our initial study we have concentrated mostly on the z @xmath10 0.3 groups , as these provide the longest time baseline for comparison with nearby groups .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained _ xmm - newton _ data primarily for the highest luminosity systems , as these targets tend to require the shortest exposure times .",
    "figure 2 shows contours of the diffuse x - ray emission overlaid on optical images of the six fields for which we have _ xmm - newton _ data ( paper ii ) .",
    "the three systems with only _ rosat _ data are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the association of the x - ray emission with an overdensity of galaxies is apparent in many cases .",
    "to determine group membership , we obtained optical spectra for galaxies in each field using multi - object spectrographs at the palomar , las campanas and keck observatories .",
    "spectroscopic candidates for each group were selected from the original r or i band images taken for the rdcs with the kpno and ctio 4 m telescopes .",
    "the program sextractor @xcite was used to classify objects as stars or galaxies and to measure magnitudes . for the present work , we considered all objects with a stellarity - index  of less than 0.5 as galaxies . at the redshifts of these groups ,",
    "the typical seeing ( 0.81.5@xmath11 ) corresponds to @xmath0 310 kpc .",
    "thus , we are unable to cleanly distinguish galaxies smaller than this size from stars .",
    "this has some impact on the selection of objects for our spectroscopic survey , although the effect appears to fairly small ( based on the spectroscopy less than 10% of the targeted objects are stars ) .",
    "priority was given to the brightest objects in each field .",
    "no color information was used to select spectroscopic candidates .",
    "this selection method has the advantage that it avoids biasing our study towards certain types of group galaxies ( i.e. red galaxies ) , but comes at the price of a higher fraction of the spectroscopic targets being non - group members .",
    "typically , three multi - slit masks were created for each group , with each mask containing between 15 and 20 objects .",
    "all of the palomar spectra were taken with the cosmic spectrograph @xcite on the 5.1 m hale telescope between 1999 and 2001 .",
    "the instrument configuration resulted in spectra covering the wavelength range @xmath0 35009800   with a spectral scale of @xmath0 3.1  / pixel .",
    "the two southern targets were observed with the wfccd spectrograph on the du pont 100-inch telescope at las campanas observatory , chile in october , 2000 .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath0 38009500   with a spectral scale of @xmath0 4  / pixel . a similar observing scheme was used for the cosmic and wfccd observations .",
    "typically , two one - hour integrations were taken for each mask , with an arc and flatfield exposure taken at the completion of each mask exposure .",
    "a cuar arc lamp was used for the cosmic data and a henear lamp was used with the wfccd .",
    "finally , one group ( rxj0329.0 + 0256 ) was observed with lris @xcite on keck i during december 2004 .",
    "the lris spectra are centered at @xmath0 6000   and have a total wavelength range of @xmath0 2500  .",
    "the cosmic and wfccd data were reduced using iraf .",
    "first , the overscan regions of the ccd chips were used to estimate and subtract the bias from each frame .",
    "flatfield exposures were then used to construct a normalized flatfield frame by performing a low - order fit in the dispersion direction .",
    "the science frames were then divided by this normalized flatfield to correct for the pixel - to - pixel response of the detector .",
    "a distortion correction was applied to each frame to align the spectra along the rows of the detector .",
    "the positions of the objects on the slit and corresponding sky regions were then defined interactively using the iraf package apextract .",
    "the spectra were then sky - subtracted and extracted to produce one - dimensional spectra .",
    "wavelength calibrations were determined for each spectrum from the arc exposures .",
    "the lris spectroscopic data were reduced with custom scripts written to process multislit observations .",
    "the scripts serve as front ends to standard iraf tasks .",
    "the processing included overscan subtraction , flat - field correction , cosmic - ray rejection , and sky subtraction .",
    "there were three science exposures obtained through each slitmask , with small dithers in the spatial direction made between exposures .",
    "the background - subtracted science exposures for each slitmask were co - added , and then one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the combined two - dimensional files .",
    "the wavelength solutions were determined from arclamp exposures that were obtained immediately after the first science exposure for each slitmask .",
    "redshifts were measured using an iraf script called redsplot ( t. small , private communication ) .",
    "this task allows the user to interactively identify a potential line feature in the spectrum and then plot the locations of other line features from a spectral line list .",
    "redshifts are then measured from the centroid of each line .",
    "we adopt the average measurement from all of the line features as the final redshift for each object .",
    "the standard deviation of all of the measurements is used to estimate the error .",
    "the redshifts for all of the group members in this paper were based on a minimum of three distinct line features .",
    "more typically , five or six features were used for the redshift determination . in total , we measure redshifts for 169 galaxies .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath0 65% success rate .",
    "a significant fraction of the objects with measured redshifts have emission lines in their spectra ( @xmath0 46% ) . however , the emission - line fraction among confirmed group members is much lower ( @xmath0 20% ) .",
    "this result is not surprising given the large population of early - type galaxies that we find in these groups (  4.3 ) .",
    "many of the group members ( 63% ) with emission lines have spectra consistent with the presence of an agn .",
    "a detailed discussion of the emission - line properties of the group galaxies is deferred to a future paper .      during the course of the palomar and las campanas observing runs described above",
    ", images of each group were taken when conditions were photometric .",
    "the images were taken with a kron - cousins r filter from the harris set .",
    "typically , we took a series of nine five - minute exposures for each field , resulting in a total integration time of 45 minutes .",
    "the images were reduced using standard techniques in iraf .",
    "the bias level was determined from the overscan region of the ccd and subtracted from the images .",
    "flat - fielding was accomplished using dome flats .",
    "the images were flux - calibrated using observations of standard star fields from @xcite .",
    "sextractor @xcite was used to measure a magnitude for each galaxy .",
    "we adopt the mag_auto  option for our total magnitudes .",
    "in addition to providing magnitudes , the r - band data were also used to determine the morphologies of the group members . given the distances of these objects and the quality of these images it is generally not possible to make detailed morphological classifications with the groundbased data .",
    "for this reason , we restrict our classifications to early  and late  type galaxies .",
    "each group member was visually classified by j.s.m . into one of the two types .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "images taken with the _ wfpc2 _ are available for all nine fields .",
    "however , given the small field of view of _ wfpc2 _ , only about half of the spectroscopically confirmed group members were observed by _",
    "hst_. independent classifications were made for each group galaxy observed with _",
    "hst_. in general , the agreement between the groundbased classifications and the _ hst_-based classifications are good . there is a disagreement in the type in @xmath0 13% of the galaxies .",
    "in all of these cases , the _ hst _ data suggest that a late - type galaxy has been misidentified as an early - type object .",
    "this is not too surprising because the _ hst _ images have the ability to reveal faint spiral structure that is not apparent in the lower resolution ground - based images .",
    "table 1 lists the j2000 coordinates , r - band magnitude , redshift , redshift error and type of redshift measurement ( abs = absorption , em = emission and abs + em = combination of absorption and emission lines ) for each galaxy in our survey with a measured redshift .",
    "in most cases , the identification of the group in redshift space is trivial as the spatial distribution of galaxies on the sky coincide with the x - ray emission .",
    "however , for a few of these fields , there are several different galaxy systems superposed along the line of sight .",
    "this leads to some ambiguity about the true redshift of the x - ray system in two of the nine systems studied here .",
    "the rxj1205.9 + 4429 field contains two significant galaxy systems , one at z @xmath0 0.35 and another z @xmath0 0.59 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation of this field shows that the x - ray emission is clearly centered on a luminous early - type galaxy that is part of the z=0.59 system ( paper ii ) .",
    "thus , we adopt this value as the redshift of this group .",
    "we note that the preliminary rdcs redshift corresponded to the lower redshift system .",
    "therefore , the x - ray luminosity is actually considerably higher than originally reported in the rdcs .",
    "the true x - ray luminosity of this system is high enough that it does not meet our original selection criterion , suggesting this is likely a much richer system than the other objects in our sample .",
    "@xcite have recently published a detailed study of the x - ray and optical properties of this system and conclude that it is a fossil group .",
    "however , our spectroscopy and imaging data indicate that the magnitude difference between the brightest and second brightest confirmed member is @xmath0 1.2 mag . in the r - band .",
    "thus , this system is not a fossil group by the standard definition usually adopted in the literature @xcite .    in the case of rjx0341 - 4459 field",
    ", we measure redshifts for five galaxies in a system at z @xmath0 0.41 .",
    "the five galaxies have a spatial distribution similar to the x - ray emission . however , there are also three foreground galaxies distributed over the same area . as these three objects have very different redshifts , they are not part of a single galaxy system .",
    "thus , we believe the x - ray emission is most likely associated with the system at z @xmath0 0.41 , although higher resolution x - ray images are required to be sure .",
    "examples like this demonstrate the difficulty sometimes encountered when trying to identify low galaxy density systems ( i.e. groups ) at high redshift even when x - ray emission is present .",
    "we determine group membership for each system using the rostat package @xcite .",
    "we start by considering all galaxies within @xmath123000 km s@xmath1 of the group s mean velocity .",
    "this is a large enough range to include all potential group members .",
    "we then calculate the biweight estimators of location ( mean velocity ) and scale ( velocity dispersion ) .",
    "objects with velocities greater than three times @xmath13@xmath14 are then removed from the sample and a new mean location and scale are calculated .",
    "this process is repeated until there are no more objects to be clipped .",
    "this procedure resulted in the removal of one galaxy from three of the groups and none from the remainder .",
    "figure 4 shows the velocity distributions of each member relative to the final mean velocity of the group .",
    "the final mean velocity and velocity dispersion are given in table 2 .",
    "for all of the systems studied here , the classical velocity dispersion ( i.e. @xmath15 , the gaussian estimator ) is in good agreement with the biweight velocity dispersion estimate . for approximately half of our sample ,",
    "the velocity dispersions are based on only @xmath0 5 velocity measurements .",
    "these velocity dispersions are rather uncertain .",
    "studies of low redshift x - ray groups suggest velocity dispersions based on a small number of galaxies can be significantly underestimated @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the l@xmath16-@xmath13 relationship for our nine groups along with the sample of nearby groups from @xcite and the moderate redshift x - ray groups from @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , several of the groups fall significantly off the relationships found for nearby groups and clusters .",
    "the two most deviant points in our sample correspond to the rxj1334.0 + 3750 and rxj1648.7 + 6019 groups .",
    "these are the two groups from our _ xmm - newton _ survey where the x - ray emission is not centered on an early - type bgg ( paper ii ) . in both cases ,",
    "these groups have very low velocity dispersions for their given x - ray luminosities .",
    "there are several possible explanations for why these groups fall so far off the relationships found for low redshift groups and clusters .",
    "first , our velocity dispersions estimates for these groups may be artificially low because they are based on relatively small numbers ( 6 and 8 members , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite find that velocity dispersions estimated from the five brightest galaxies can be underestimated by as much as a factor of three .",
    "a similar factor would bring our two most deviant groups in agreement with the relationship found for nearby groups and clusters .",
    "this idea can be tested by obtaining more velocity measurements .",
    "second , the x - ray luminosities of these groups may have been enhanced or contaminated in some way .",
    "for example , the observed x - ray emission may be dominated by galaxy emission that is unresolved with our _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "while we believe this is very unlikely given the high x - ray luminosities of our groups and the extent and morphology of the x - ray gas , we can not rule this possibility out without higher resolution x - ray images .",
    "thirdly , the velocity dispersions may have been reduced in some way . @xcite",
    "have studied several nearby groups that fall off the l@xmath16-@xmath13 relationship in a similar manner to our groups ( although the x - ray luminosities of the nearby groups are nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the present examples ) .",
    "they suggest several physical mechanisms that could reduce the velocity dispersions including dynamical friction and tidal heating .",
    "they also suggest that orientation effects can lead to an artificially low observed velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , the low velocity dispersions could be an indication that these groups are in the process of collapsing for the first time and therefore the measured velocity dispersions do not yet accurately reflect the depth of the group potential ( see section 4.5 ) .",
    "studies of x - ray groups at low redshift have revealed a very strong tendency for these systems to be dominated by early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "table 2 lists the early - type fraction for our groups ( based on the _ hst _ morphological classifications , where possible ) . for all but one of our objects ,",
    "the early - type fractions are in the range @xmath0 0.40.8 .",
    "for the four groups with just four to six members known , these fractions could be somewhat over - estimated as our analysis is restricted to the brightest group members , which tend to be ellipticals @xcite . however , even for the groups with many more members identified , the early - type fractions are comparable to those of rich clusters sampled out to similar radii @xcite .",
    "thus , the trend for x - ray groups to contain a large number of early - type galaxies appears to be in place out to at least z @xmath0 0.5 .",
    "the one exception in our sample is the rxj0210.4 - 3929 group , which based on the hst imaging is dominated by spiral galaxies .",
    "the large number of spirals in this system make it very unusual among x - ray groups at both low and moderate redshifts .    a correlation between early - type fraction and velocity dispersion has been noted for nearby group samples @xcite , suggesting that galaxy morphology is related to the depth of the group potential . for groups with well - determined membership ,",
    "the relationship is surprisingly robust @xcite . in figure 6",
    ", we plot these quantities for our sample along with the low redshift data from @xcite . among our moderate redshift groups ,",
    "there is considerable scatter and no indication of a trend between early - type fraction and velocity dispersion .",
    "we suspect much of this scatter is an indication that neither quantity is well - determined for most of our groups .",
    "however , we note that the two groups in our sample with membership data comparable to that of the @xcite sample ( i.e. @xmath0 20 known members ) do appear to follow the trend found at low redshift .",
    "in fact , these two groups suggest that the relationship found by @xcite extends to the range of poor clusters .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the relationship can not be the same as for rich clusters as it would predict an unphysical early - type fraction for clusters with velocity dispersions above @xmath0 800 km s@xmath1 .",
    "previous work on low redshift x - ray groups indicates that the x - ray emission is usually centered on a luminous elliptical galaxy @xcite . in almost every case ,",
    "this elliptical is the most luminous galaxy in the group .",
    "as the peak in the x - ray emission is likely coincident with the center of the group potential , this implies that the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) lies at the center of the potential .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to define the peak of the x - ray emission for the present sample from the low signal - to - noise _ rosat _ images .",
    "however , six of the nine groups have now been observed by _ xmm - newton _ and four of these are consistent with the x - ray peak being coincident with the brightest group elliptical ( paper ii ) . in all four groups with a central bgg ,",
    "the radial velocity of the bgg is consistent with the mean velocity of the group within the velocity errors .",
    "thus , similar to the case found for nearby x - ray groups @xcite , the bgg is likely at or near the center of the group potential in these systems .",
    "however , for three of the four groups where we find a dominant bgg , the central object appears to be composed of multiple nuclei ( see figure 7 ) . in the two most spectacular cases ( rxj0720.8 + 7109 and rxj1256.0 + 2556 ) , the central object has three components .",
    "although multiple nuclei in cd galaxies in clusters are fairly common @xcite , in the majority of cases there is a large magnitude difference between the various components .",
    "in contrast , for both of our three nuclei systems , the second nuclei have r - band magnitudes within @xmath0 0.5 mag .",
    "of the brightest component . in the case of the rxj0720.8 + 7109 group ,",
    "the second nucleus is the second brightest galaxy in the group .",
    "previous studies of multiple nuclei in clusters have found large velocity offsets between the various components in some cases , indicating these systems are not bound and are thus not in the process of merging @xcite . for the rxj0720.8 + 7109 group , we obtained a spectrum of the two brightest components and find a radial velocity difference of @xmath0 200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "given the typical errors on our velocity measurements ( @xmath0 100 km s@xmath1 ) , our data are consistent with a similar radial velocity for the two components .",
    "thus , the two components may be bound .",
    "for the other triple system , rxj1256.0 + 2556 , we only obtained a velocity for the central component , so we can not infer anything further about the nature of the multiple nuclei .",
    "as noted above , in only four of the nine groups in our sample is the x - ray emission clearly centered on an early - type galaxy . in two of the other groups",
    "the most luminous galaxy is an elliptical , but the existing x - ray data are not sufficient to determine an x - ray center ( rxj0341.9 - 4459 and rxj1347.9 + 0752 ) .",
    "thus , we can not draw strong conclusions for these two groups as to whether the x - ray emission is peaked on the dominant elliptical galaxy or not .",
    "for both groups , the brightest elliptical is offset in velocity from the mean velocity of the group by several hundred kilometers per second .",
    "however , we have very few velocity measurements for both systems , so the mean velocity of the group is not well - determined and we can not draw strong conclusions regarding a potential offset of the bgg from the group center .    however , the remaining three groups in our sample deviate strongly from the low redshift trend for there to be a dominant elliptical galaxy at the center of the group potential .",
    "the rxj1334.0 + 3750 group contains a dominant elliptical , but the peak of the x - ray emission is offset significantly from this galaxy ( paper ii ) .",
    "the velocity of this galaxy is consistent with the mean velocity of the group within the errors on each measurement .",
    "however , given the very low velocity dispersion of this system ( @xmath13=121@xmath17 ) and the small number of known members ( 6 ) , we can not draw strong conclusions with the existing velocity data .",
    "the most luminous galaxy in the rxj1648.7 + 6019 group is also an elliptical , although the group contains several galaxies of comparable luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data suggest the x - ray emission is not centered on any particular galaxy , but is instead distributed in a chain morphology similar to the distribution of galaxies near the group center ( paper ii ) .",
    "the brightest elliptical is also offset in velocity from the mean velocity of the group by more than 200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this provides further evidence that this galaxy is not at the center of the group potential .",
    "a chain - like morphology is also found in the rxj0210.4 - 3929 group . in this case ,",
    "the brightest galaxies in the chain are spirals .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for this system , so we can not be sure where the x - ray emission peaks .",
    "regardless , the most luminous early - type galaxy near the group center is nearly a magnitude fainter than the brightest spirals and has a velocity offset by nearly 400 km s@xmath1 from the mean velocity of the group .",
    "thus , this group also lacks a dominant central early - type galaxy .",
    "as discussed in the last section , at least three ( and potentially five ) of the nine groups in the present sample do not appear to have a central dominant early - type galaxy .",
    "furthermore , in three of the four groups where the x - ray emission is centered on a bgg , the central galaxy is not a single object , but rather is composed of multiple components .",
    "these observations suggest that most of the groups in our sample are not dynamically evolved . instead",
    ", we appear to be catching them in the process of virialization .    the global x - ray properties of these groups are consistent with the properties of more dynamically relaxed systems , however ( paper ii ) .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray properties of groups are already in place early in the formation of these systems . specifically , the intragroup medium properties appear to be largely set prior to the bgg experiencing its last major merger and settling at the center of the group potential .",
    "this scenario would also explain the lack of evolution observed in the x - ray luminosity function of groups out to z @xmath0 0.5 @xcite despite the morphological peculiarities we find over the same redshift interval . if true , the temperature of the hot gas component may provide a better indication of the global group potential early on than the velocity dispersion of the galaxies .",
    "this might explain the very low velocity dispersions observed for the rxj1334.0 + 3750 and rxj1648.7 + 6019 groups : the x - ray temperatures of these systems reflect the massive group potentials , but the velocity dispersions of the galaxies do not yet accurately probe the group mass .",
    "cosmological simulations of groups that include both the intragroup gas and galaxies may be able to test this idea .",
    "the late assembly of the bgg in groups is consistent with the results of simulations in hierarchical cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the groups in our sample appear to cover a range in dynamical state and can therefore provide some clues into the formation process of the bgg .",
    "the rxj0210.4 - 3929 and rxj1648.7 + 6019 groups do not yet contain a dominant early - type galaxy and thus they are likely at the earliest stages of group formation .",
    "the morphological compositions of these groups are very different , with rxj0210.4 - 3929 consisting mostly of spirals and rxj1648.7 + 6019 mostly of early - type galaxies .",
    "this suggests that both early and late type galaxies can be the dominant contributor to the final merger product .",
    "the groups with a multiple component bgg are likely much further along in the virialization process .",
    "in fact , the bgg in these groups is probably undergoing its final major merger .",
    "finally , only one of the groups in our sample is consistent with being a relaxed , virialized system ( rxj0329.0 + 0256 ) . in this case ,",
    "the bgg is at the center of the group potential as determined from both the x - ray emission and the velocity distribution of the group members and is unlikely to undergo any more major mergers .",
    "the fact that many of our intermediate redshift groups do not have a dominant central elliptical is somewhat surprising given that such groups appear to be very rare among local x - ray group samples @xcite .",
    "one potential concern in comparing our intermediate redshift groups to local samples is that the best studied local samples were not selected in a similar manner .",
    "in fact , the largest rosat surveys of groups were performed with very heterogeneous samples of groups mostly drawn from optical catalogs @xcite . to allow a better comparison to low redshift systems , we have selected a sample of nearby x - ray groups and poor clusters from two surveys based on the _ rosat _ all - sky survey : the noras @xcite and reflex @xcite group and cluster samples . from each survey , we have selected all of groups and clusters with x - ray luminosities between @xmath0 2 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath0 2 @xmath7 10@xmath9 in the _ rosat _ band ( i.e. the corresponding selection criterion for our intermediate redshift sample ) with z @xmath18 0.05 . eliminating duplicate entries from the two catalogs produces a sample of 74 x - ray luminous groups and clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the vast majority of these systems have not been previously studied in detail in either the optical or x - ray bandpasses .",
    "however , a literature search reveals that 19 of the 74 systems have deeper x - ray images published .",
    "the existing data for this subset of groups suggests these x - ray selected systems follow the trends found among the more heterogeneously selected nearby group samples . in particular , in all 19 of the groups ,",
    "the x - ray emission is centered on a luminous early - type galaxy .",
    "furthermore , we find no multiple - nuclei examples among the 19 nearby bggs .",
    "this suggest that the differences we find between our intermediate redshift systems and local samples are not the result of a selection effect . rather , the intermediate redshift groups appear to be less dynamically evolved than present day luminous x - ray groups .",
    "a closer examination of low redshift samples suggests that there are some local examples of x - ray groups without a central bgg @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosities of these systems are one to three orders of magnitude lower than the x - ray luminosities of our moderate redshift groups . among the @xmath0 60 low redshift x - ray groups that have been studied in detail with _ rosat _ , the most luminous example of a system without a early - type bgg is the ngc 5171 group ( l@xmath16 @xmath0 3 @xmath7 10@xmath19 erg / s ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , among the most x - ray luminous ( l@xmath16 @xmath10 5 @xmath7 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath1 ) groups in the nearby universe , there appear to be no known counterparts to the systems we find at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the failure to find nearby examples of such systems suggests that the most x - ray luminous groups have largely reached virialization by z @xmath0 0 .",
    "this suggest that we are witnessing group downsizing : while the most luminous ( and thus most massive ) groups are still in the process of virializing at intermediate redshifts , this process is restricted to much less luminous ( and thus less massive ) systems at the present day .",
    "we have performed multi - object spectroscopy in the fields of nine candidate x - ray groups selected from the _ rosat _ deep cluster survey .",
    "the velocity dispersions derived from our data span the range expected for groups and poor clusters .",
    "we have used groundbased and hst images of these fields to quantify the morphological compositions of these systems .",
    "we find that like low redshift x - ray groups , these systems contain a substantial population of early - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , the large early - type fractions in x - ray groups are in place by at least z @xmath0 0.5 .    in four of our nine groups ,",
    "the x - ray emission is centered on a dominant early - type galaxy . in these cases ,",
    "the velocity of the dominant galaxy is consistent with the mean velocity of the group , suggesting these galaxies are at the center of the group potential .",
    "however , in three of these four groups , the central galaxy is composed of multiple components , suggesting the bgg is still undergoing major mergers .",
    "this idea can be tested with more detailed spectroscopy of the multiple nuclei .    in at least three and potentially five of our groups",
    ", we find no evidence for a dominant central early - type galaxy .",
    "in several cases , a dominant elliptical exists , but it is not at the center of the group potential as determined by the x - ray emission or velocity distribution .",
    "in addition , two of the groups in the present sample do not contain a dominant early - type galaxy at all .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of our intermediate redshift groups contain a bgg with multiple components or contain no central bgg at all suggests that these systems are not dynamically evolved .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of these systems are similar to those of nearby virialized groups , suggesting that the x - ray emission in groups likely reflects the global properties of the potential earlier than the velocity distribution of the member galaxies .",
    "a comparison of our moderate redshift sample with similarly selected groups at low redshift indicates that the most x - ray luminous groups have reached a virialized state by the present time",
    ". however , there are examples of lower x - ray luminosity systems at low redshift that do not contain a central bgg",
    ". this may be evidence for group downsizing : while massive groups were still in the process of collapsing and virializing at intermediate redshifts , only lower mass systems are forming at the present time .",
    "while the current study has uncovered some interesting results , much better data will be required to confirm our conclusions .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining higher quality spectroscopy for these systems which will allow a much more detailed analysis of their dynamical state and a first look at the properties of the individual galaxies in these groups .",
