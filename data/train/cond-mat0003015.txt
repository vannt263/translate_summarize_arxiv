    "negatively ( x@xmath0 ) and positively ( x@xmath1 ) charged excitons , also called _ trions _ , have been the object of intense studies in the last years , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the stability of charged excitons in bulk semiconductors was proven theoretically by lampert@xcite in the  late fifties , but only recently they have been observed in quantum well structures : first in cdte / cdznte by kheng _ et al._@xcite and subsequently in gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as@xcite .",
    "the calculation we present in this paper , of the ground state energy for the exciton ( x ) and the charged exciton , fully includes the coulomb interaction among the particles , i.e. no approximated average potential is assumed in any of the three spatial directions and the correlation among the particles is fully taken into account .",
    "the hamiltonian of a negatively charged exciton ( x@xmath0 ) in a quantum well is in the effective mass approximation given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 indicate the electrons and @xmath7 the hole ; @xmath8 @xmath9 are the quantum well confinement potentials ; @xmath10 is the kinetic operator for particle @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the corresponding mass ; @xmath13 is the sum of the coulomb electron - electron and electron - hole interactions , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the elementary charge and @xmath16 the static dielectric constant . in the present work the heights of the square well confinement potentials are @xmath17 ev for the electrons and @xmath18 ev for the holes for the gaas / al@xmath19ga@xmath3as quantum well system .",
    "the hamiltonian is then solved using the stochastic variational method@xcite .",
    "the trial function is taken as a linear combination of correlated gaussian functions , @xmath20 \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 gives the positions of the @xmath22 particle in the direction @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the antisymmetrization operator and @xmath25 are the variational parameters .",
    "the dimension of the basis , @xmath26 , is increased until the energy is sufficiently accurate .",
    "the correlation energy of a charged exciton is defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 the energy level of the charged exciton and , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the energy levels of the free electron and hole , respectively , in the quantum well .",
    "we discuss here the results obtained for a gaas / al@xmath19ga@xmath3as quantum well with @xmath31 .",
    "the values of the gaas masses used are @xmath32 @xmath33 which results into @xmath34 mev and @xmath35  .",
    "our numerical results for the correlation energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ comp - stebe ] and are compared with the results of ref . .",
    "for the x we find that the magnitude of the correlation energy is larger than the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite while for the x@xmath0 our approach gives a @xmath36 smaller magnitude for the correlation energy@xmath37 the reasons for the difference are : 1 ) in ref .",
    "the coulomb potential along @xmath38the @xmath39-direction was approximated by an analytical form , see appendix in ref .",
    "this approximation leads , as the authors already noted , to an error in the x correlation energy of approximately 5% ; 2 ) for the x@xmath0 energy the authors of ref.@xcite did not report an estimate of the error introduced by the approximations made .",
    "however we find a decrease of the absolute value of the correlation energy by about 5% .",
    "we think that this result is not in conflict with the one obtained for the x. in fact if in ref .",
    "@xcite for the x case the intensity of the attractive interaction between the electron and hole ( e - h ) was underestimated , for the x@xmath0 case also the intensity of the repulsive interaction between the electrons ( e - e ) is underestimated which leads to a less negative e@xmath40 .",
    "we also report the correlation energy for the x@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ comp - stebe ] .",
    "note that the correlation energy of the x@xmath1 is practically equal to the one of x@xmath0 .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with recent experimental data @xcite where the binding energy of the x@xmath1 is found to be equal to the one of  the x@xmath0 .    next we take into account , for the narrow well regime , the difference in mass of the particles in the well ( gaas ) and in the barrier ( al@xmath19ga@xmath41as ) material .",
    "the values for the gaas - masses , i.e. the masses for the electron and the hole , are taken equal to the one used in the previous calculation .",
    "the values for the masses in al@xmath19ga@xmath3as are @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 indicates the percentage of al present in the alloy . if we assume , as a first approximation , that the electron and the hole have part of their wave function in the quantum well and the rest in the barrier we may take the total effective mass of the electron and the hole as given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the masses of the @xmath11-th particle in the barrier and in the well , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the probabilities of finding the @xmath11-th particle in the well or in the barrier , respectively .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ asymm ] .",
    "we observe that the effect of the mass mismatch is important only in the narrow quantum well regime , i.e. l@xmath49 @xmath50  , where it leads to a substantial increase of the energy .",
    "the dependence of the total energy on the hole mass for a 200   wide quantum well is shown in fig .",
    "the energy of the negatively charged exciton becomes equal to the d@xmath0 energy@xcite for @xmath51 16 .",
    "note that the x@xmath1 energy is for large values of the hole electron mass ratio parallel to the one of the x@xmath0 . for a large hole mass",
    "its contribution to the total energy in terms of confinement energy is negligible , and the difference between the total energy of the positively and the negatively charged exciton is just due to the confinement energy of one electron , which does not dependent on the hole mass .",
    "experimental data were reported for the binding energy of the x@xmath0 in zero magnetic field for a 200 @xcite , a 220 @xcite  and a 300 @xcite  quantum well . the binding energy is defined as @xmath52 the experimental results are shown in fig . [ binding ] together with our theorethical calculation , where the shaded band indicates the estimate accuracy of our variational procedure .",
    "notice that the experimental results give a larger binding energy as compared to the theoretical estimate and this discrepancy increases with decreasing well width .",
    "this may be a consequence of the localization@xcite of the trion due to well width fluctuations which become more important with decreasing l.    last we study the wave function of the x@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ geometry](a ) we show the contour plot of @xmath53 for a x@xmath0 in a quantum well of width 100  .",
    "we fix the hole in @xmath54 and one of the two electrons in@xmath55 and calculate the probability to find the other electron in the @xmath56-plane .",
    "notice that the second electron sits far from the hole and the fixed electron and behaves like an electron weakly bound to a polarized exciton .",
    "if now we fix the hole in @xmath57 and the electron in @xmath58 , see fig . [ geometry](b ) , we observe that the second electron is completely localized around the hole and the configuration that we obtain is the one of an exciton plus an extra electron .",
    "in this paper a new calculation for the exciton and the charged exciton energy in a quantum well was presented which is based on the stochastic variational method . to our knowledge , this is the first time , that a calculation fully includes the effect of the coulomb interaction and the confinement due to the quantum well .",
    "the results obtained do not show a big qualitative difference from the one already present in the literature , however a sensible quantitative difference is observed .",
    "this difference leads to an improvement of the agreement with available experimental data for the binding energy .",
