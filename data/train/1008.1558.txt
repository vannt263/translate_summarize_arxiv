    "2008 ) on board the _ hinode _ satellite . in recent years , following the observations , considerable attention has been paid in the investigation of the structure of magnetic field lines and its evolution in ar 10930 related to the occurrence of the x3.4 flare on 2006 december 13 .",
    "there were studies of sunspot rotation associated with the flare such as the remarkable counterclockwise rotation of the positive polarity sunspot ( yan et al .",
    "2009 ) , interaction between the fast rotating positive sunspot and ephemeral regions near the sunspot ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) , and nonpotential magnetic stress ( su et al . 2008 ) .",
    "ar 10930 was also investigated for a change of magnetic field lines at the flaring site before and after the flare , e.g. , in the azimuth angle ( kubo et al .",
    "moreover , time variations of the magnetic helicity injection rate ( zhang et al . 2008 ; magara & tsuneta 2008 ) and intermittency ( abramenko et al . 2008 ) were examined over a time span of several days around the time of the flare .    to resolve the limitations of using photospheric magnetic field data ,",
    "some studies have been carried out on the x3.4 flare with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) coronal magnetic fields derived from nonlinear force - free ( nlff ) extrapolation methods .",
    "jing et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported that magnetic shear around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line decreased after the flare at coronal heights in the range of 870 mm . by calculating the 3d electric current in ar 10930 , schrijver et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that there are long fibrils of strong current slightly above the photosphere that almost completely disappear after the flare .",
    "later on , wang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the strong current - carrying fibrils are associated with the magnetic channel structure of ar 10930 and the flare occurred during the period in which the channels rapidly developed .",
    "in addition , the free energy of the nlff fields was studied to understand the energy buildup , storage , and release processes in the corona during the flare .",
    "the free energy release of 2.4@xmath510@xmath9 erg during the flare was measured by guo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and jing et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that a significant amount of free energy continuously built up in the 2 days prior to the flare .    encouraged by interesting results of previous studies with nlff fields , in this study",
    ", we investigate the variation of the coronal relative magnetic helicity in ar 10930 over a span of several days to determine its relationship with the flare .",
    "magnetic helicity is a measure of how much the magnetic field lines in a flux tube are twisted around the tube axis , how much the tube axis is kinked , and how much the flux tubes are interlinked with each other in a magnetic field system .",
    "it has been studied in order to understand the energy buildup process and trigger mechanism for flare occurrence .",
    "we anticipate that the coronal magnetic helicity study will bring a better understanding of the long - term evolution of the large - scale magnetic field geometry in the corona related to the x3.4 flare despite of a critical assessment ( e.g. , de rosa et al .",
    "2009 ) in nlff extrapolation that existing nlff extrapolation models are not able to accurately reproduce coronal fields and physical quantities of interest in the ar corona due to problematic issues such as the non - force - free nature of the photospheric magnetic field , limited field of view ( fov ) , and noise level of vector magnetograms , etc .",
    "coronal helicity will also be compared with the helicity injection through the photospheric surface to check their relationship and consistency .",
    "the relative magnetic helicity , @xmath10 , derived by finn & antonsen(1985 ) is used to calculate a topologically meaningful and gauge - invariant measure of helicity inside a volume , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the potential field having the same normal component as the magnetic field , @xmath14 , on the boundary surface enclosing @xmath11 . @xmath15 and @xmath15@xmath16 are the vector potentials for @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 represents the amount of helicity subtracted from the corresponding potential field @xmath13 . in our calculation of @xmath10 in a coronal volume of ar 10930 , we adopt the code of fan ( 2009 ) for the determination of the specific vector potentials , @xmath15 and @xmath15@xmath16 , proposed by devore ( 2000 ) in treating the photosphere as an infinite plane ( @xmath17 = 0 ) in a cartesian coordinate system . the unsigned magnetic flux , @xmath18 , through the photospheric surface , @xmath19 , of ar 10930 is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath17-component of magnetic field and the integration is over the entire photospheric area ( @xmath17 = 0 ) of the computational domain of 3d nlff field data .",
    "note that outside of the computational domain of ar 10930 , the magnetic field is assumed to be negligible , even though , on average , @xmath830% of @xmath18 passed through the domain of the actual 3d nlff fields .",
    "our helicity calculation , therefore , gives an approximate value of @xmath10 in a coronal volume above the photospheric surface of ar 10930 .    throughout this paper , by magnetic helicity we mean the relative magnetic helicity .",
    "we estimate the rate of magnetic helicity injection , @xmath22 , into the coronal volume through @xmath19 of ar 10930 using the method developed by chae ( 2007 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the helicity flux density proposed by pariat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and can be obtained with the normal component of magnetic field and the apparent horizontal velocity , @xmath25 , of the photospheric field line footpoints .",
    "we determine @xmath25 by applying the normal component of the magnetic induction equation and the differential affine velocity estimator ( dave ) method developed by schuck ( 2006 ) .",
    "please refer to the procedure described in chae ( 2007 ) for the details of the @xmath22 calculation .",
    "after @xmath22 is determined as a function of time , we integrate it with respect to time to determine the amount of helicity accumulation , @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the start and end time of the data set under investigation , respectively .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath10 in a 3d coronal volume , the three components of the magnetic field in that coronal volume need to be obtained . therefore , we follow the same method described in jing et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in deriving the coronal nlff fields in ar 10930 from the stokes profiles taken by the _ hinode_/sot spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) .",
    "we first derived the high - resolution vector magnetic fields in the photosphere from the stokes profiles using an unno  rachkovsky inversion based on the miler  eddington atmosphere ( e.g. , lites & skumanich 1990 ; klimchuk et al . 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , the removal of the 180@xmath30 ambiguity in the transverse magnetic fields was accomplished using the minimum energy algorithm ( metcalf et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the photospheric vector magnetograms were projected onto the tangent plane at the heliographic location of the center of the magnetograms . to reduce the inaccuracy of nlff field extrapolation , it is important to derive suitable boundary fields for the nlff field modeling from the photospheric magnetograms . therefore , using a preprocessing method developed by wiegelmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we minimized the effect of the lorentz force acting in the photosphere and prepared the nlff boundary fields to be in the condition of the low plasma-@xmath31 force - free chromosphere .",
    "we then used the weighted optimization method ( wiegelmann 2004 ) to extrapolate the nlff coronal fields from the photospheric magnetograms .",
    "this method has been well recognized as an outstanding performance algorithm by some model tests of nlff fields ( e.g. , schrijver et al .",
    "2006 ; metcalf et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "ar 10930 appeared on the east limb of the solar disk on 2006 december 6 , and was successfully and continuously observed during the time interval of its entire disk passage by _ hinode_/sot and _ soho_/mdi . in this study , we determine @xmath10 in ar 10930 during the time span of 2006 december 8 , 21:20 ut through 2006 december 14 , 5:00 ut using 27 _ hinode_/sot - sp vector magnetograms as the boundary fields for nlff field extrapolation .",
    "the computational dimensions of the 3d nlff field data were considered as 240@xmath5132@xmath5180 pixel@xmath32 corresponding to 288@xmath5158@xmath5216 mm@xmath32 . to check the influence of preprocessing on the magnetogram data",
    ", we calculated @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the original data and those of the preprocessed data which wiegelmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed to investigate in order to determine how well a photospheric magnetic field agrees with aly s criteria : @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the force - balance condition and the torque - free condition , respectively .",
    "refer to wiegelmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the details of the preprocessing method and the definitions of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the preprocessed data satisfy the aly criteria much better than the original data .",
    "it has been reported that this preprocessing procedure significantly improves the boundary fields toward a force - free condition ( e.g. , wiegelmann et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "recently , jing et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also showed the capability of the preprocessing method by comparing the unpreprocessed / preprocessed photospheric line of sight ( los ) magnetogram of ar 10930 with the co - aligned chromospheric los magnetogram . to evaluate the performance of the nlff extrapolation",
    ", we also calculated the current - weighted sine metric ( cwsin ) and the @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37@xmath36@xmath38 metric proposed by wheatland et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for each extrapolated field .",
    "cwsin and @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37@xmath36@xmath38 measure the degree of convergence to a force - free and divergence - free field , respectively .",
    "for the 27 nlff fields under investigation , the average cwsin was estimated as @xmath80.39 and the average @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37@xmath36@xmath38 as @xmath80.0014 indicating that residual forces and divergences exist in the nlff fields .",
    "in addition , the error estimation of @xmath10 is carried out with a monte carlo method by only taking into account the sensitivity of the sp measurement as follows ( e.g. , see guo et al .",
    "2008 ) : first , we add three sets of artificial noises to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath21 of the original sp vector magnetogram at 20:30 ut on 2006 december 12 . each noise set consists of pseudorandom numbers in normal distribution with the standard deviation of 5 g for @xmath21 and 50 g for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that these values of 5 g and 50 g are estimated as the maximum values of the sp sensitivity in the los direction and the transverse direction , respectively ( tsuneta et al .",
    "then , we extrapolate the 3d nlff fields from the noise - imposed vector magnetogram following the procedure described in the above paragraph , calculate @xmath10 , and repeat the same process 10 times . finally , we consider the standard deviation of 10 sets of @xmath10 to be the uncertainty of the @xmath10 calculation .",
    "the uncertainty was found to be 8@xmath510@xmath41 mx@xmath7 corresponding to 2@xmath424@xmath42 of @xmath43 during the measurement period .    in order to calculate @xmath22",
    ", we used the data set consisting of 63 full - disk mdi magnetograms at the 96 minute cadence in the time span of 2006 december 8 , 20:51 ut through 2006 december 13 , 16:03 ut .",
    "note that the mdi magnetograms in the data set show the zeeman saturation in the central part of the negative sunspot umbral region , which means that our calculation of @xmath22 might be underestimated .",
    "the window function of dave used in the @xmath22 calculation is the top - hat profile which puts the same weight of unity to every pixel inside the window ( e.g. , schuck 2006 ) and the window size is selected to be 10 arcsec .",
    "we also applied dave to two mdi images with the spatial derivatives calculated from the average of the two images ( e.g. , welsch et al .",
    "2007 ; chae 2007 ; chae & sakurai 2008 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath22 corresponding to the measurement uncertainty ( @xmath820 g ) of mdi magnetograms was also estimated using the same monte carlo method used in the error estimation of @xmath10 .",
    "it is found that the uncertainty of @xmath22 is 8.4@xmath510@xmath44 mx@xmath7 hr@xmath45 which is equivalent to @xmath83% of the average @xmath22 during the measurement time .",
    "the uncertainty therefore does not significantly affect our study of @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",
    "our main objective in this study is to examine how well @xmath10 and @xmath26 are correlated with each other and whether our @xmath10 calculation using the nlff coronal fields is verified through a comparison of the @xmath10 derived from the _ hinode_/sot - sp data with the @xmath26 derived from the _ soho_/mdi data . in figure 1 , therefore , we plot the temporal variations of @xmath10 ( black solid line ) and @xmath26 ( gray solid line ) .",
    "the estimated error in @xmath10 is marked with error bars .",
    "the initial value of @xmath26 is set the same as that of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath43 , the absolute value of @xmath10 , is also shown by a dotted line for convenience .",
    "we also investigate the day - to - day variations of @xmath10 in ar 10930 for a better understanding of the pre - flare conditions and a trigger mechanism of the x3.4 flare .",
    "for this , @xmath10 ( black solid line ) is plotted with the total unsigned magnetic flux ( dashed line ) and the _ goes _ soft x - ray light curve ( dotted line ) in figure 2 .",
    "note that lim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have done a similar study in which they compared the coronal helicity in ar 10696 with the helicity injection through the photosphere . in their study , the coronal helicity was estimated as a probable range using a linear force - free ( lff ) assumption with a force - free constant that gives the best fit with each of the individual coronal loops , even though the real coronal field is not lff .",
    "the photospheric helicity injection was calculated by inferring the velocity of the apparent horizontal motion of the field lines determined by the technique of local correlation tracking ( lct ) , as originally proposed by chae ( 2001 ) , instead of using @xmath25 determined by the dave technique .",
    "they found that the temporal variation of the coronal helicity is similar to that of the photospheric helicity injection with a discrepancy of @xmath815% .    during the first day of the helicity measurement ,",
    "@xmath10 showed little change from its initial value , @xmath42.8@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 , though there were small fluctuations in the range of 2@xmath4215@xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath43 decreased by 28@xmath42 from 2.9@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 to 2.1@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 for 14 hr from december 10 .",
    "note that the decrease of @xmath43 could be due to ( 1 ) a pre - existing negative helicity being expelled from the volume of the nlff field extrapolation , e.g. , via coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and/or ( 2 ) a new magnetic flux with positive helicity being injected from outside into the volume or a positive helicity being produced by the shearing motions of pre - existing field lines .",
    "we found that there are three time periods ( i , ii@xmath46 , and iii ) over which @xmath43 decreases consistently for more than nine hours , and they are shown as shaded areas in figure 1 . between periods",
    "i and iii , there was a consistently large increase of negative helicity , @xmath43.2@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 , in the corona over @xmath81.5 days ( marked as period ii@xmath47 in figure 1 ) .",
    "after period iii , a negative helicity kept on increasing for @xmath81 day with flux increase .",
    "the detailed information of the characteristic periods is shown in table 2 .",
    "we compare the overall pattern of the temporal evolution of the @xmath10 calculated using the nlff fields with that of the @xmath26 measured using the mdi magnetograms .",
    "in general , the time profile of @xmath10 matches well that of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , in both cases , the absolute amount of negative helicity accumulation during the entire measurement period of december 914 was similar ( 2.1@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 and 1.7@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the nlff extrapolation and the @xmath10 calculation are reasonably well established .",
    "however , some detailed patterns of helicity evolution show a difference between @xmath10 and @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the temporal variation of @xmath10 shows a rapid and large increase of negative helicity with flux increase at the time period of the fast rotational speed in the southern positive sunspot measured by min & chae ( 2009 ) and yan et al .",
    "in addition , @xmath43 represents decreasing phases such as periods i , ii@xmath46 , and iii , while @xmath48 increases monotonically during the entire period .",
    "note that @xmath10 should not necessarily be exactly the same as @xmath26 : e.g. , the ejection of magnetic helicity via the launch of a cme would not be detected in @xmath26 while it would be reflected in @xmath10 .",
    "what could cause the three periods of remarkable @xmath43 decrease ? to investigate this , we first checked a possibility associated with the negative helicity ejection via cmes that originated from ar 10930 .",
    "soho_/large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; yashiro et al .",
    "2004 ) cme catalog was used to search for all the cmes that occurred during the three periods .",
    "we then identified only the cmes inferred to be produced in ar 10930 with the following criterion : the position angle of a cme should be within @xmath495@xmath30 from that of ar 10930 on the solar disk at the first appearance time of the cme in the lasco / c2 fov .",
    "note that there were no other ars except for ar 10930 on the front side of the solar disk during the periods .",
    "we found two cmes : one in period ii@xmath46 and the other in period iii .",
    "their initial appearances in the lasco / c2 fov were at 09:36 ut on december 11 and at 20:28 ut on december 12 , respectively , which are marked with the vertical dashed lines in figure 2 .",
    "although the uncertainty of our @xmath10 calculation is estimated to be 8@xmath510@xmath41 mx@xmath7 , we found that the decrease in @xmath43 is 2.4@xmath510@xmath50 mx@xmath7 between 08:31 ut and 11:48 ut on december 11 and 1.9@xmath510@xmath50 mx@xmath7 between 18:12 ut and 21:01 ut on december 12 covering the time of the occurrence of the first cme and that of the second cme , respectively .",
    "these values agree with the helicity content of a typical cme , 2@xmath510@xmath50 mx@xmath7 , estimated by devore ( 2000 ) .",
    "our finding of the cme - related change of @xmath43 is similar to the earlier finding by lim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in which they found a helicity decrease of @xmath84.1@xmath510@xmath50 mx@xmath7 after the occurrence of two cmes .",
    "we also investigated the feasibility of positive helicity injection through the photospheric surface of ar 10930 into the corona .",
    "note that zhang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have calculated @xmath22 in ar 10930 using the lct method ( chae 2001 ) .",
    "they found that the sign of @xmath22 changes from negative to positive and then from positive to negative during the period ( 01:30 ut04:30 ut ) of the flare , while @xmath22 is predominantly negative during 2006 december 814 . integrating the positive ( negative ) @xmath24 over the photospheric surface of ar 10930 , we determined @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , i.e. , the injection rate of positive ( negative ) helicity .",
    "figure 3 shows the time variations of @xmath51 ( diamonds ) , @xmath52 ( crosses ) , and @xmath22 ( solid line ) during the @xmath26 measurement period .",
    "the characteristic periods are marked in the same way as in figure 1 , and the peak time of the x3.4 flare is shown as the vertical dotted line .",
    "we found that a remarkable accumulation of positive helicity into the corona is established over the entire period with an average injection rate of 2.8@xmath510@xmath41 mx@xmath7 hr@xmath45 , even though most of the time @xmath52 is dominant with an average injection rate of -4.4@xmath510@xmath41 mx@xmath7 hr@xmath45 . especially during the span of december 11 , 12:51 ut ( middle of period",
    "ii@xmath46 ) through december 12 , 04:48 ut ( start of period iii ) , the average of @xmath51 showed a large value of 4.5@xmath510@xmath41 mx@xmath7 hr@xmath45 , and @xmath51 was sometimes larger than @xmath52 .",
    "additionally , we examined the @xmath24 maps at several times ( marked by vertical solid lines in figure 3 ) to find out how the positive @xmath24 is distributed and developed on the ar .",
    "figure 4 shows the maps of the normal component of the magnetic field , @xmath53 ( left panels ) , and @xmath24 ( right panels ) .",
    "assuming that the magnetic field on the solar photosphere is normal to the solar surface , @xmath53 was approximately determined from the mdi los magnetograms .",
    "we found that there are noticeable injections of positive helicity around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line ( see the three @xmath24 maps in figure 4 : 2006 - 12 - 11 12:51 ut , 2006 - 12 - 12 04:48 ut , and 2006 - 12 - 12 23:59 ut ) .",
    "in addition , the examination of the other @xmath24 maps during the period of december 11 , 12:00 ut through december 13 , 16:00 ut revealed that positive helicity is consistently injected through the polarity inversion line .",
    "the location and time span of the positive helicity injection are similar to those of the magnetic channel structure development observed by wang et al .",
    "note that a simulation by rgnier ( 2009 ) shows that newly injected current from the photosphere can sensitively affect the coronal magnetic helicity in existing force - free bipolar fields : i.e. , @xmath10 is increased by 2 orders of magnitude when the current strength is increased by a factor of 2 . we therefore speculate that periods ii@xmath46 and iii are associated with the helicity ejection via the two cmes and/or the supply of positive helicity from the photosphere into the corona .",
    "related to the occurrence of the x3.4 flare , we found two interesting patterns of the long - term @xmath10 evolution .",
    "first , there was a significant increase of negative @xmath10 for period ii@xmath47 of @xmath81.5 days associated with the flare energy buildup .",
    "this pattern of increasing helicity prior to the flare is in agreement with that shown in the study of park et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) . after the middle of period",
    "ii@xmath47 , a large amount of helicity of the opposite ( positive ) sign started to be injected through the photospheric surface around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line during the time span ( including periods ii@xmath46 and iii ) of the channel structure development observed by wang et al .",
    "the x3.4 flare was preceded by the two characteristic patterns of @xmath10 .",
    "these two patterns have been already reported by previous studies of major flares related with helicity injection through photospheric surfaces of ars ( park et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; chandra et al .",
    "note that our finding of the long - term injection of positive helicity @xmath82.5 days before the flare is different from the abrupt injection of positive helicity around the start of the flare found by zhang et al .",
    "we conjecture that the occurrence of the x3.4 flare is involved with the emergence of a positive helicity system into an existing negative helicity system which may cause a reconnection between the two helicity systems .",
    "this idea is not only supported by numerical simulation ( kusano et al .",
    "2003b ) in which magnetic reconnection quickly grows in the site of helicity annihilation with different signs but also by observational reports for the opposite sign of helicity injection through the photosphere surface of ars before flares ( kusano et al .",
    "2003a ; yokoyama et al .",
    "2003 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", after analyzing @xmath10 in the coronal volume of ar 10930 using the nlff fields , we found that there are two characteristic phases of day - to - day variation of helicity related to the x3.4 flare : significant helicity accumulation ( period ii@xmath47 ) followed by opposite sign helicity injection ( periods ii@xmath46 and iii ) . @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath26 show a roughly similar variation during the entire measurement period .",
    "further studies are needed to check whether the two characteristic patterns are shown in other major flaring ars and to investigate the short - term variation of helicity in a flaring region related to a triggering mechanism .",
    "the _ solar dynamic observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) was recently launched and we expect to study the 3d coronal helicity using full - disk photospheric vector magnetograms with high spatial and temporal resolution taken by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board the _ sdo_.    we are grateful to the referee for helpful and constructive comments .",

    "<S> to study the three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic field topology and its long - term evolution associated with the x3.4 flare of 2006 december 13 , we investigate the coronal relative magnetic helicity in the flaring active region ( ar ) noaa 10930 during the time period of december 814 . </S>",
    "<S> the coronal helicity is calculated based on the 3d nonlinear force - free magnetic fields reconstructed by the weighted optimization method of wiegelmann , and is compared with the amount of helicity injected through the photospheric surface of the ar . </S>",
    "<S> the helicity injection is determined from the magnetic helicity flux density proposed by pariat et al . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3/michelson doppler imager magnetograms . </S>",
    "<S> the major findings of this study are the following . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the time profile of the coronal helicity shows a good correlation with that of the helicity accumulation by injection through the surface . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the coronal helicity of the ar is estimated to be @xmath44.3@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 just before the x3.4 flare . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) this flare is preceded not only by a large increase of negative helicity , @xmath43.2@xmath510@xmath6 mx@xmath7 , in the corona over @xmath81.5 days but also by noticeable injections of positive helicity though the photospheric surface around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line during the time period of the channel structure development . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the occurrence of the x3.4 flare is involved with the positive helicity injection into an existing system of negative helicity . </S>"
