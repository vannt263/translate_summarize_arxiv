    "understanding the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates @xcite is a prerequisite for making use of a myriad of biological and technological applications such as eye irrigation , cell adhesion , tertiary oil recovery , coating , lubrication , paper industry , micro - mechanical devices , and the production of integrated circuits .",
    "generically , the solid surfaces in the above mentioned examples are not ideal in the sense that they are neither smooth nor homogeneous .",
    "most surfaces are topographically or chemically heterogeneous .",
    "such heterogeneities may substantially change the wetting behavior of these surfaces @xcite , which is not necessarily detrimental with respect to envisaged applications .",
    "certain topographically structured surfaces are superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic . in the first case droplets roll off these substrates ( instead of flowing ) ,",
    "such that these surfaces are self - cleaning @xcite . in the second case the surface topography leads to a complete spreading of droplets @xcite .",
    "tailored topographic surface structures can induce particular dewetting processes which in turn can be exploited to pattern substrates on the micron scale @xcite .",
    "microfluidics is another strong driving force for the research on the dynamics of fluids on structured substrates .",
    "shrinking standard laboratory setups to a lab - on - a - chip promises huge cost reduction and speed - up @xcite .",
    "open microfluidic systems , i.e. , with free liquid - vapor or liquid - liquid interfaces , may provide various advantages such as reduced friction , better accessibility of the reactants , and reduced risk of clogging by solute particles @xcite . in open microfluidic devices fluids are guided along chemical channels @xcite or in grooves @xcite , which can be chemically patterned in oder to provide additional functionality @xcite .",
    "wetting phenomena on topographically structured substrates have attracted substantial research efforts @xcite with , however , the main focus on equilibrium phenomena . in view of the aforementioned applications , dynamical aspects are of particular interest . in spite of this demand ,",
    "theoretical work on the dynamics of liquid films and droplets on topographically structured substrates has started only recently . in most of these studies",
    "the dynamics of the fluids is assumed to be well described by macroscopic hydrodynamic equations , which are solved either directly @xcite , by a lattice boltzmann method @xcite , or in the thin film ( lubrication ) regime @xcite .",
    "the applicability of this latter method is limited because the inherent long - wavelength approximation does not keep track of many relevant microscopic features @xcite .    on the nanoscale",
    ", macroscopic hydrodynamic equations turn out to be inadequate for describing the dynamics of fluids .",
    "overcoming this deficit is the focus of a new research area called nanofluidics @xcite .",
    "wetting phenomena in particular reveal these deviations ; for a recent review of these issues see ref .",
    "however , hydrodynamic equations can be augmented to include hydrodynamic slip , the finite range of intermolecular interactions , and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the resulting mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations have been rather successful in analyzing , e.g. , the dynamics of dewetting on homogeneous substrates @xcite .",
    "the presence of intermolecular interactions can be summarized into the so - called disjoining pressure ( djp ) , @xmath0 where the effective interface potential @xmath1 is the cost of free energy to maintain a homogeneous wetting film of prescribed thickness @xmath2 . on a homogeneous substrate",
    "@xmath1 is independent of lateral coordinates parallel to the substrate surface and the equilibrium wetting film thickness @xmath3 minimizes @xmath4 .",
    "however , on chemically or topographically inhomogeneous substrates ( structured , rough , or dirty ) the generalized disjoining pressure does depend in addition on these lateral coordinates . in most studies ,",
    "the lateral variations of the disjoining pressure have been modelled rather crudely , i.e. , the substrate is assumed to be locally homogeneous and lateral interferences of heterogeneities are neglected : e.g. , a step is typically modelled by an abrupt change of the disjoining pressure @xcite .",
    "recently we have demonstrated , that the actually smooth variation of the lateral action of surface heterogeneities can change the behavior of droplets in the vicinity of chemical steps @xcite or topographical features ( edges and wedges ) @xcite even qualitatively . in the present study",
    "we extend these results to the case of an isolated straight topographic step in an otherwise homogeneous substrate ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ dpstep ] ) and we recover the previously studied case of isolated wedges and edges in the limit of infinite step height @xmath5 . we should emphasize that our investigation provides only a first but nonetheless essential step towards understanding the dynamics of droplets on arbitrarily structured substrates . although more refined than previously used models the present one is still rather simple .",
    "we only consider additive lennard - jones type intermolecular interactions , i.e. , we do not take into account electrostatic interactions which would be very important for polar fluids .",
    "we assume the fluid to be newtonian , non - volatile , and incompressible ( which is compatible with the frequently used so - called sharp - kink approximation of classical equilibrium density functional theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we also assume a no - slip boundary condition at the solid surface @xcite and neglect the influence of thermal fluctuations @xcite . for numerical reasons",
    "we restrict our investigation to two - dimensional ( 2d ) droplets , corresponding to three - dimensional ( 3d ) liquid ridges ( or rivulets ) which are translationally invariant in the direction parallel to the step ; nonetheless we expect our results to hold qualitatively also for 3d droplets .",
    "( on the top side and bottom side of the step ) are exposed to the vertically and laterally varying disjoining pressure @xmath6 , the contour plot of which is shown .",
    "the topographic step and the drops are taken to be translationally invariant along the @xmath7 axis ( i.e. , orthogonal to the image plane ) . in ( a )",
    "the substrate is chosen to correspond to the minus case with ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and in ( b ) the substrate corresponds to the plus case ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ djpfar ] ) for definitions ) .",
    "lengths ( @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 ) and the disjoining pressure @xmath6 are measured in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ( see the main text for definitions ) . ]",
    "we study the dynamics of non - volatile and newtonian nanodroplets ( corresponding to three - dimensional ridges which are translationally invariant in one lateral direction ) on topographically stepped surfaces within the framework of mesoscopic hydrodynamics , i.e. , by solving the augmented stokes equation presented in sec .  [ mesohydrosec ] with the numerical method described in [ numersec ] .",
    "we consider in particular the effects due to the long range of lennard - jones type intermolecular interactions which enter the theoretical description in terms of the disjoining pressure ( djp ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dpstep ] .",
    "we assume the substrate to be chemically homogeneous in the lateral directions and the surface to be covered by a thin layer of a different material . as detailded in sec .",
    "[ modeling ] this leads to two adjustable parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 which enter into the djp and characterize the wetting properties of the substrate , i.e. , the equilibrium contact angle @xmath16 and the wetting film thickness @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ djpshapes ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bc ] both for positive and for negative hamaker constants one can find a one - parameter family of pairs @xmath17 leading to the same @xmath16 on a flat substrate ( i.e. , without a step ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ flat ] nanodroplets on substrates with the same @xmath16 but with different values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 assume shapes which differ mainly in the vicinity of the three - phase contact line with the apex region is almost unaffected by the substrate potential .",
    "the results of the numerical solution of the mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "in contrast to macroscopic expectations based on a capillary model ( i.e. , taking into account only interface energies and neglecting the long range of the intermolecular interactions ) , topographic steps do influence droplets in their vicinity : on substrates with a positive hamaker constant ( figs .  [ effstepplus ] and [ wedgediffhplus ] ) , droplets move in uphill direction while on substrates with a negative hamaker constant ( figs .",
    "[ effstepp ] and [ wedgediffhminus ] ) the droplets move in the opposite direction . as expected the forces on the droplets and their resulting velocity increase with the step height , but also with the absolute value of the hamaker constant .",
    "this is the case if the contact angle is varied ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ edgeeffc ] and [ wedgediffcminus ] ) and even if the contact angle is fixed by varying the hamaker constant and the properties of the coating layer together ( see figs .  [ edgediffb ] , [ edgeplus ] , [ wedgediffb ] , and [ wedgediffbplus ] ) .    the speed of the droplets increases with their size as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ wedgedropsize ] . as detailed in subsec .",
    "[ direction ] , the influence of the step on a droplet can be phrased in terms of an effective wettability gradient , i.e. , a spatially varying equilibrium contact angle .",
    "the driving force on droplets on such substrates increases linearly with the droplet size because the difference in equilibrium contact angle at the two contact lines of the liquid ridges increases roughly linearly with the distance from the steps .",
    "the velocity of droplets driven away from the step decreases rapidly with the distance from the step as shown in sec .  [ discuss ] .",
    "but droplets moving towards the step ( either on the top side or on the bottom side of the step ) stop with their leading contact line close to the step edge or wedge , respectively .",
    "therefore they do not cross the step ( see figs .",
    "[ effstepp ] , [ comppisigma ] , [ edgeeffc ] , [ edgediffb ] , [ wedgediffhplus ] , and [ wedgediffbplus ] ) .",
    "accordingly , edges , wedges , and steps act as barriers for migrating droplets ( which is also true macroscopically ) because droplets sitting right at the tip of an edge are in an free - energetically unfavorable state ( see fig .  [ overedge ] ) while droplets located in the corner of a wedge are in a state corresponding to a local minimum of the free energy ( see fig .",
    "[ wedgeforce ] ) .",
    "therefore , an external force is required to push droplets over edges ( see fig .",
    "[ edgeforce ] ) or to pull them out of wedges ( see fig .",
    "[ wedgeforce ] ) . in both cases , the total ( i.e. , integrated over the droplet volume ) force required to accomplish this increases slightly with the droplet volume , but less than linearly .",
    "this means , that if the force is applied via a body force density acting per unit volume ( e.g. , gravity ) larger droplets experience a larger force and therefore overcome steps more easily .",
    "in addition , the lateral action of intermolecular forces can also pin droplets at edges and near wedges .",
    "however , droplets which initially span a topographic step always end up filling the wedge at the step base , either with the upper contact line pinned at the step edge or , if the droplet volume is too small , with the upper contact line on the vertical part of the step , as shown in fig .",
    "[ overwedge ] .",
    "a deeper understanding of the dynamics of droplets in the vicinity of edges and wedges can be reached by analyzing the forces acting on the droplet surface , i.e. , the disjoining pressure and surface tension ( see eqs .",
    "( [ dpforce ] ) and ( [ sigmaforce ] ) , respectively ) . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ comppisigma ] , if the droplets move under the influence of the topographic step only , the main contribution to the driving force stems from the disjoining pressure . as shown in figs .",
    "[ dropsize ] and [ stepsize ] , the numerically observed features of the dynamics of droplets can be understood in terms of the disjoining pressure induced force density on the droplets calculated for droplets of simple parabolic shapes used as initial conditions for the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations .",

    "[ profsize ] the actual relaxed droplet shape is different but the calculated forces depend only weakly on the deviation of the actual shape from its parabolic approximation . in the limit of large distances from the step the force",
    "can be calculated analytically ( see subsec .  [ direction ] ) : far from the step the total force per unit ridge length @xmath18 ( with the cross - sectional area @xmath19 ) essentially depends on the ratio of the step height @xmath5 and the distance from the step @xmath20 as well as on the ratio of the apex height @xmath21 and @xmath20 . the corresponding asymptotic results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ asymptofig ] . in all cases",
    "the force density varies according to a power law @xmath22 with @xmath23 . for finite sized droplet and steps of finite height",
    "we obtain the fastest decay and for almost macroscopic droplets in the vicinity of finite sized steps as well as for nanodroplets near isolated edges and wedges we get @xmath24 . while our present analysis can not be applied to the case of an almost macroscopic droplet in a wedge , for large drops ( @xmath25 ) next to an isolated edge we get the weakest decay with @xmath26 . in any case , the total force per unit length @xmath27 is proportional to the hamaker constant as observed in the numerical solution of the mesoscopic stokes dynamics as well as in the force analysis presented in subec .",

    "unfortunately , in such simulations taking into account the long - ranged component of the intermolecular forces increases the numerical cost drastically , such that most of the effects discussed here are not accessible by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "this leaves the question of experimental tests of our theoretical predictions presented here . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite the forces on the nanodroplets are of the order of @xmath347  n ( i.e. , about eight orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force on such a droplet ) and the resulting velocities range between @xmath348 and @xmath349 for viscosities between @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "while topographic surface structures of almost any type can be produced with modern lithographic techniques , positioning nanodroplets with nanometer accuracy next to a step remains a tough challenge .",
    "most promising are techniques based on using atomic force microscopes as pens @xcite , but there are no experiments available yet . experimentally it is much easier to grow droplets from an aerosol or a vapor phase rather than to deposit them at a specific location .",
    "experimentally it has been shown , that water nanodroplets preferentially condense onto terrace steps of vicinal surfaces @xcite . however , these data do not allow one to determine whether the droplets reside on the top terrace , on the bottom terrace , or whether they span the step",
    ". this example shows , that condensation on ( and evaporation from ) nano - structured substrates is a challenging problem of its own .",
    "from the step .",
    "the boundary of the system @xmath352 decomposes into three different groups : liquid - liquid ( @xmath353 ) , liquid - solid ( @xmath354 ) , and liquid - vapor ( @xmath355 ) interfaces .",
    "the discretized node points considered in the numerical investigation are indicated ; @xmath36 and @xmath356 represents the normal and the tangential unit vectors on @xmath352 , respectively . ]    in order to study the effect of the intermolecular forces on nanodroplets near a topographic step we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stokes])([eq : surfacebc ] ) numerically using a standard and accurate biharmonic boundary integral method ( bbim ) @xcite . to this end",
    "we introduce the stream function @xmath357 so that @xmath358 and @xmath359 as well as the vorticity @xmath360 which allows us to reformulate the dimensionless versions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stokes ] ) and ( [ eq : incomp ] ) in terms the following harmonic and biharmonic equations @xcite : @xmath361 and @xmath362    the standard bbim relies on mapping the equations for @xmath363 and @xmath364 onto the boundary @xmath365 of the fluid , parameterized in terms of its contour length parameter @xmath72 .",
    "this results in an integral equation for @xmath363 , @xmath364 , and their derivatives @xmath366 and @xmath367 , with the surface normal vector pointing outwards of the liquid . by dividing the boundary of the system into a series of elements ( see fig .",
    "[ numfig ] ) one obtains a coupled system of algebraic equations which can be solved numerically . with the tangential velocity @xmath368 and the normal velocity @xmath369 ( with the index @xmath72 indicating the derivative in the direction tangential to the boundary ) the position of the liquid boundary after a time step can be calculated via the explicit euler scheme @xcite : @xmath370 in order to solve these equations the boundary conditions of the system must be expressed in terms of @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "depending on the phases in contact with each other , three different types of boundary interfaces can be identified ( see fig .",
    "[ numfig ] ) : liquid - solid interfaces @xmath44 , liquid - liquid interfaces ( those boundaries @xmath371 and @xmath372 which are located at the end sides of the system ) , and liquid - vapor interfaces @xmath35 . for @xmath44 we impose the no - slip condition ( @xmath373 ) which corresponds to @xmath374 and @xmath375 . for @xmath371 and @xmath372",
    "we apply a no - flux condition which corresponds to having a vertical symmetry plane there .",
    "such a system corresponds to a periodic repetition of the system attached to its mirror image .",
    "correspondingly the slope of the liquid - vapor interface at the side ends of the system is zero .",
    "these conditions can be implemented by setting @xmath374 and @xmath376 there .",
    "the tangential and the normal component of the boundary condition ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) along the liquid - vapor interface @xmath35 in terms of the stream function and the vorticity read ( lower indices @xmath72 indicate derivatives with respect to the contour length parameter @xmath72 ) @xmath377 and @xmath378 respectively , with the local curvature @xmath379    in order to increase the efficiency of the numerical calculations we employ an adaptive time stepping : for any numerical step , the time step is selected such that the displacement of any node does not exceed @xmath380 percents of the length of the elements connected to that node ; @xmath380 can be changed during the numerical calculations .",
    "the starting value for @xmath380 and the rate of its increase depends on the actual situation but typically we have started with @xmath381 and then gradually increased it to 0.1 or even more . in order to avoid numerical instabilities , the position of the end points of the boundary elements are smoothed after a specified number of steps by fitting a spline through the points on the liquid - vapor interface , followed by selecting new and equally spaced points on the spline .",
