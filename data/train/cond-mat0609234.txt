    "elastic objects in random media are the simplest example of a disordered system exhibiting metastability , glassy behavior , and dimensional reduction , which are difficulties present in a broader class of disordered systems @xcite .",

    "domain walls in magnets behave as elastic interfaces and can experience either random bond disorder ( rb ) as in ferromagnets with nonmagnetic impurities , or random field disorder ( rf ) as in disordered antiferromagnets in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the interface between two immiscible liquids in a porous medium exhibits the same behavior and undergoes a depinning transition as the pressure difference is increased @xcite .",
    "charge - density waves ( cdw ) in solids show a similar conduction threshold @xcite .",
    "another example of periodic systems are vortex lines in superconductors which can form different glass phases in the presence of weak disorder @xcite . in all these systems ,",
    "the interplay between elastic forces that tend to keep the system ordered , i.e. , flat or periodic , and quenched disorder , which promotes deformations of the local structure , forms a complicated energy landscape with numerous metastable states .",
    "this results in glassy properties and a nontrivial response of the system to external perturbations .",
    "in particular , the interface becomes rough with displacements growing with the distance @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the roughness exponent .",
    "elastic periodic structures in the presence of disorder lose their strict translational order and form quasi - long - range order characterized by a slow growth of displacements , @xmath10 where the amplitude @xmath11 is universal in the simplest case . at zero temperature",
    ", a driving force @xmath12 exceeding the threshold value @xmath13 is required to set the elastic manifold into steady motion with a velocity @xmath14 that vanishes as @xmath15 at the transition point .",
    "the correlation length diverges close to the transition @xmath16 as @xmath17 and the characteristic time as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "note that the roughness exponent and the universal amplitudes determined at the depinning transition are in general different from the exponent and amplitudes measured in equilibrium .",
    "two methods were developed to study the statics of an elastic manifold in a disordered medium .",
    "one of them is the gaussian variational approximation ( gva ) performed in replica space , which can be applied to both classes of elastic manifolds , i.e. , to interfaces @xcite without overhangs and to periodic systems @xcite . within this approach , which is believed to be exact in the mean - field limit , i.e. , when the manifold lives in a space of infinite dimensions , metastability is described by breaking of replica symmetry , which allows one to compute the static correlation functions and to obtain different thermodynamic properties .",
    "another method that can be applied to dynamics as well as to statics is the functional renormalization group ( frg ) @xcite .",
    "simple scaling arguments show that large - scale properties of elastic systems are governed by disorder for @xmath20 and that perturbation theory in the disorder breaks down on scales larger than the so - called larkin scale @xcite . to overcome this difficulty , one performs a renormalization - group analysis .",
    "it was shown that in this case one has to renormalize the whole disorder correlator that becomes a nonanalytic function beyond the larkin scale @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a non - analyticity in the form of a cusp at the origin is related to metastability , and nicely accounts for the generation of a threshold force at the depinning transition .",
    "it was recently shown that the frg can unambiguously be extended to higher loop order so that the underlining nonanalytic field theory is probably renormalizable to all orders @xcite .",
    "although the two methods , gva and frg , are very different , they provide a fairly consistent picture of the statics , and recently a relation between them was found @xcite .",
    "there is also good agreement with results of numerical simulations , not only for critical exponents @xcite but also for the whole renormalized disorder correlator @xcite .",
    "however , many questions remain open .",
    "although the dynamics in the vicinity of the depinning transition and at zero temperature is well understood , there is no satisfactory theory for finite temperature , and in particular for the thermal rounding of the depinning transition @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that the exponent @xmath6 in experiments on depinning is usually larger than @xmath21 , while frg and numerical simulations of elastic systems with weak disorder give values smaller than  @xmath21 .",
    "most studies of elastic manifolds in a disordered medium treat uncorrelated pointlike disorder .",
    "real systems , however , often contain extended defects in the form of linear dislocations , planar grain boundaries , three - dimensional cavities , etc . it is known that such extended defects , or pointlike defects with sufficiently long - range correlations , can change the bulk critical behavior . flux lines in superconductors are the most prominent example .",
    "the pinning of the flux lines by disorder prevents the dissipation of energy and determines the critical current @xmath22 , which is of great importance for applications .",
    "it was found that extended defects produced , for instance , by heavy - ion irradiation , can increase @xmath22 by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "systems with anisotropic orientation of extended defects can be described by a model in which all defects are strongly correlated in @xmath23 dimensions and randomly distributed over the remaining @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "the case @xmath25 is associated with uncorrelated pointlike defects , while extended columnar or planar defects are related to the cases @xmath26 and 2 , respectively . the bulk - critical behavior in the presence of this type of disorder was studied in refs",

    "it was argued recently that the topologically ordered glass phase ( bragg glass ) formed by flux lines can be destroyed in the vicinity of a single planar defect @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the small dispersion in orientation of columnar defects forms a new thermodynamic phase called `` splayed glass '' @xcite . in this phase ,",
    "the entanglement of flux lines enhances significantly the transport of superconductors @xcite .",
    "competition between various types of disorder , point and columnar , has also been studied , at equilibrium @xcite and in the moving phases @xcite .    in the case of an isotropic distribution of disorder ,",
    "power - law correlations are the simplest example with the possibility for a scaling behavior with new fixed points ( fps ) and new critical exponents .",

    "the power - law correlation of defects in @xmath28-dimensional space with exponent @xmath29 can be ascribed to randomly distributed extended defects of internal dimension @xmath23 with random orientation .",
    "for example , @xmath30 corresponds to uncorrelated pointlike defects , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) describes infinite lines ( planes ) of defects with random orientation . in general , one would probably not expect a pure power - law decay of correlations . however , if the correlations of defects arise from different sources with a broad distribution of characteristic length scales , one can expect that the resulting correlations will over several decades be approximated by an effective power law  @xcite . if the correlation function of disorder can be expressed as a finite sum of power - law contributions @xmath33 , one can expect that the scaling behavior is dominated by the term with the smallest @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "power - law correlations with a noninteger value @xmath35 can be found in systems containing defects with fractal dimension @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "we consider a @xmath28-dimensional elastic manifold embedded in a @xmath39-dimensional space with quenched disorder .",

    "below we discuss how these classes extend to the case of lr internal disorder ( @xmath68 nonzero ) .",
    "the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ model ] ) could easily be studied using presently available numerical algorithms for directed manifolds , in its statics ( e.g. , exact ground - state determinations ) and its dynamics ( e.g. , critical configuration at depinning ) , by directly implementing a random potential correlated as described by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to examine which type of correlations in a random medium can naturally lead to eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) and how such disorder could be realized from , e.g. , distributions of extended defects , since some of them may be experimentally feasible .",
    "let us first recall how long - range correlations can arise in the potential created by defects . to this purpose ,",
    "call @xmath69 the defect potential , in the simplest case taken to be proportional to defect density . consider for simplicity a large number of weak defect lines with a uniform and isotropic distribution in a space of dimension @xmath39 .",

    "the probability that point @xmath73 is contained in the defect going through @xmath1 is @xmath74 , i.e. , inversely proportional to the sphere of radius @xmath75 .",
    "this is easily generalized to isotropic distributions of extended defects of internal dimension @xmath23 , with @xmath76 .",
    "note that by extended defects we mean defects that are perfectly correlated along their internal dimension .",
    "generalizations where defects are themselves ( anisotropic ) fractals can also be considered .",
    "an important case is a uniform distribution of extended defects in @xmath39-dimensional space , but isotropic only within a linear subspace of dimension @xmath77 .",
    "for instance , one can irradiate a material in the bulk while simultaneously rotating it along an axis .",
    "this produces a distribution of linear defects ( @xmath26 ) , isotropic within the plane ( @xmath78 ) , and normal to the axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - dw - inplane ] ) .",
    "more generally , this yields a defect potential with second cumulant , @xmath79 while @xmath80 is short - ranged ( here @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "although we mostly discuss extended defects , other sources of long - range correlations are possible , such as defects where each single one creates a long - ranged disorder potential , or a substrate matrix itself quenched at a critical point .",
    "we now examine how the long - range correlated defect potential couples to the elastic manifold and what type of lr model results .",
    "a general formulation of this coupling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) has the form @xmath84 where the defect potential lives in the @xmath39-dimensional space parametrized by @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the internal coordinate of the manifold .",

    ".,width=2 ]    let us first discuss elastic interfaces in the so - called random bond ( rb ) case , where the coupling between disorder and interface occurs only in the vicinity of the interface as , e.g. , for domain walls in magnets with random bond disorder .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - dw - inplane ] .",
    "another physical realization consists of extended defects with finite random lengths such that the distribution of lengths has a power - law tail for large lengths .",

    "this will be discussed in sec . [",
    "sec : extended ] . finally , note that we consider weak gaussian disorder .",
    "it is possible that at strong disorder another phase exists where the line or manifold gets localized along the strongest extended defect .",
    "random field ( rf ) disorder is described by the function @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this means that the change in energy when the interface moves between two configurations is proportional to the sum of all defect potentials in the volume ( in @xmath99 ) spanned by this change .",
