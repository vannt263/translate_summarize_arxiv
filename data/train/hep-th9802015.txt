    "solitons arise in many model field theories@xcite where nontrivial time - independent solutions to the classical field equations exist .",

    "topological arguments support the stability of some particularly interesting solitons .",
    "however , much less is known about the fate of `` non - topological solitons '' that appear as minima in the classical action , but have no deeper claim to stability when quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "the quantum corrections to the energies of classical field configurations are typically highly divergent in @xmath0 dimensions . in some cases , like the skyrme model@xcite , the underlying theory is non - renormalizable , so the quantum contribution to the soliton s energy is unavoidably cut - off dependent and ambiguous , like any other radiative correction in a non - renormalizable theory .    in this letter",
    "we describe a systematic and efficient procedure for calculating the quantum fluctuations about time - independent field configurations in renormalizable field theories .",
    "we show that all divergences can be removed by the same renormalization procedure that renders the perturbative sector of the theory finite .",
    "the only `` ambiguities '' are the well known scheme and scale dependences of the renormalization prescription that are resolved completely in the perturbative sector .",
    "the result of our program is a renormalized quantum `` effective energy '' , whose non - trivial minima ( if they exist ) describe solitons in the quantum theory .",
    "first we show how to regulate and renormalize the divergences in the sum over quantum fluctuations",
    ". then we develop calculational methods that are efficient and practical enough that quantum effects can be included in a search for stable field configurations .",
    "our results take the form of an effective energy , @xmath1 , depending on the `` profile function '' of the renormalized field , @xmath2 , the renormalized mass , @xmath3 , and various renormalized couplings , @xmath4 , defined in the usual perturbative sector of the model .",
    "one may then search over the parameter space characterizing @xmath2 for minima of @xmath5 while holding @xmath3 and @xmath4 fixed . here",
    "we treat the simple case of a charged scalar coupled to the field @xmath6 .",
    "our methods can be generalized straightforwardly to models including fermions , gauge fields and self - coupled scalars .",
    "however , our approach is limited in that we work only to order @xmath7 , and we only consider spherically symmetric profile functions .",
    "the possibility that the top quark in the standard model might be described as a non - topological soliton @xcite provided the original motivation for our work .",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath8 , leads to its mass , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the higgs vacuum expectation value . for large @xmath8 it would therefore appear favorable to suppress the higgs condensate in the vicinity of the @xmath11-quark , and the top quark",
    "would be a sort of `` bag '' .",
    "however , gradient and potential energy terms in the higgs sector of the classical action oppose the creation of a such a bag in the higgs condensate . in order to study the problem at the quantum level it is necessary to regulate and renormalize the divergences in the @xmath11-quark fluctuations about a deformation of the higgs condensate .",
    "it is crucial to hold the renormalized parameters of the standard model fixed while varying the possible profiles of the higgs field .",
    "bagger and naculich studied this problem by making a derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "they also worked in a large-@xmath12 approximation , in which there are no quantum corrections above order @xmath7 .",
    "we would expect that if the @xmath11-quark is a bag , then the higgs field will vary significantly  @xmath13  over distance scales of order the compton wavelength of the top quark  @xmath14 .",
    "however , the @xmath11-quark mass , @xmath9 , also sets the scale for the derivative expansion .",
    "thus all derivatives are of the same size , making the expansion unreliable .",
    "our method is designed for such situations .",
    "we can trace elements of our approach back to schwinger s work on qed in strong fields @xcite .",
    "schwinger studied the energy of the electron s quantum fluctuations  the `` casimir energy ''  in the presence of a prescribed , static configuration of electromagnetic fields .",
    "he isolated the divergences in low orders of perturbation theory .",
    "our work can be viewed as an extension of schwinger s to situations where the field is determined self - consistently by minimizing the total energy of the system including the casimir energy .",
    "in addition we complete the renormalization program and develop practical computational methods in three dimensions .",
    "dashen , hasslacher and neveu renormalized the divergent contributions to the energy of the @xmath15 kink and sine - gordon soliton in 1 + 1 dimensions using a simple version of the method we propose here @xcite .",
    "ambiguities in these models recently pointed out and studied by rebhan and van nieuwenhuizen @xcite can also be resolved with our methods .",
    "studies of solitons in renormalizable models often note that the divergences in the quantum contribution to the soliton energy can be cancelled by the available counterterms @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of any work in 3 + 1 dimensions in which renormalization of the field configuration energy is done in a manner consistent with on - shell mass and coupling constant renormalization in the perturbative sector .",
