    ", we always have that for any @xmath63 there exists a hyperplane @xmath77 with @xmath83 .",

    "[ ex : setup ] as an example consider the probability measure @xmath40 defined by the probability density that is constant non - zero on a ball in @xmath1 with center @xmath89 and radius @xmath90 and zero everywhere else .",

    "in this case we can find an @xmath88 such that @xmath92 always lies on a line through @xmath89 and has the desired property .",
    "moreover @xmath93 is continuous and differentiable , @xmath94 is a sphere with center @xmath89 and radius strictly smaller than @xmath90 and @xmath95 is tangent to @xmath94 with @xmath96 .",
    "these additional properties of @xmath88 aid intuition , however , we make use of them only in the examples .    to illustrate the use of such a map @xmath88 , we give the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath0 be continuous measures , @xmath97 such that for all @xmath8 and all @xmath98 the choice of @xmath99 such that @xmath78 is unique .",
    "let @xmath100 be such that @xmath101 for all @xmath8 .",
    "then there is a hyperplane @xmath3 such that @xmath5 for all @xmath8 if and only if there exists a @xmath98 and a hyperplane @xmath3 with normal @xmath12 such that @xmath102 for all @xmath8 .    `` @xmath103 '' let @xmath12 be the normal of @xmath3 . by assumption there is only one hyperplane with normal @xmath12 that gives the desired split .",

    "this hyperplane can not meet @xmath121 , so there is no hyperplane splitting all three measures according to the desired ratio .",
    "we have seen that if the @xmath56 lie on a line , we can not expect there to be an uneven splitting .",
