    "contaminant migration in porous media is often characterized by non - fickian ( anomalous ) transport : following injection , the spread of the pollutants plume might grow nonlinearly in time , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the resulting concentration profiles display a non - gaussian behavior  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , particles flow in perfectly homogeneous media ( where the fickian advection - dispersion mechanisms apply ) gives rise to linear spread and gaussian shapes : see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein .",
    "many concurrent processes may explain the observed deviations from gaussianity .",
    "for instance , the presence of irregularities at multiple space scales  @xcite , the complex structures of flow streams  @xcite and saturation / stagnation distribution within the medium  @xcite , and the physical - chemical or bio - physical exchanges of the pollutant particles with the surrounding material  @xcite make the homogeneity hypothesis questionable .",
    "anomalous transport often displays non - universal features : different physical conditions lead to concentration profiles that , while sharing some properties ( such as the scaling law for the spread , for instance ) , can not be interpreted within a single coherent framework .",
    "this is especially apparent in presence of boundaries  @xcite , and explains the coexistence of several models aimed at understanding and predicting solutes dynamics in complex materials . among them , some of the most widely adopted formulations are the continuous time random walk ( ctrw )  @xcite and the fractal mobile - immobile model ( f - mim )  @xcite : both have indeed been applied with success to the analysis of experimental data ranging from laboratory to field scale  @xcite . in particular , these approaches are well suited to shed light on the ` heavy tailed ' ( power - law decaying ) breakthrough curves ( btcs ) that are frequently measured at the outlet of experimental setups , and the non - gaussian shapes of spatial contaminant profiles . for a detailed discussion on the distinct features ,",
    "advantages and limitations of these models see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the long - time asymptotic behavior of these formulations may look very similar ( up to an appropriate renaming of the coefficients )  @xcite when the analysis is limited to given physical quantities ( such as btcs ) , whereas relevant discrepancies may appear at a closer inspection ( by examining , e.g. , spatial profiles as we will see in the following ) .",
    "moreover , the governing equations for anomalous transport sometimes appear in the literature under different forms , equivalent when all parameters , e.g. , the dispersion coefficient or the velocity , are constant and uniform",
    ". this equivalence may break down when the parameters depend on position and/or time ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in all such cases",
    ", one must adopt more precise hypotheses on the microscopic solute dynamics in the traversed medium , so to single out an appropriate model for the experimental data under consideration .",
    "in general , however , solutes trajectories are hardly accessible by experiments ( at least in the context of contaminant transport in porous media ) , so that one must resort to ensemble - averaged macroscopic measurable quantities in order to discriminate between hypotheses . for instance , the comparison between model - predicted and experimentally measured btcs and spatial profiles may allow choosing the most appropriate conceptual framework .    according to the f - mim model , in the hydrodynamic limit",
    "the evolution of the contaminant plume density is ruled by a transport equation involving integral - differential operators of non - integer ( fractional ) order in time , as shown in  @xcite on the basis of numerical and theoretical arguments . here",
    "the hydrodynamic limit refers to the fact that we are observing the plume behavior at space and time scales much longer than those characterizing the typical particles displacements .",
    "the prototype equation for the evolution of so - called fractional dynamics is the fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe )  @xcite : indeed , f",
    "- mim and ffpe share many features , and show a similar asymptotic behavior . however , these two equations are not equivalent , and represent hydrodynamic limits of distinct small - scale models for particles trajectories .    in particular , the ffpe corresponds to random walks performing gaussian jumps ( in potential fields ) that take random durations to be completed  @xcite , whereas f - mim describes random walks involving immobile periods ( of random duration ) and gaussian displacements at each time step  @xcite .",
    "conceptually , the former is an expedient means of describing a broad spectrum of velocities , such those characterizing flows in heterogeneous and/or nonsaturated media , whereas the latter allows distinguishing between a solid matrix ( where particles are stuck , such as in a low permeability region : the so - called immobile phase ) and a bulk flow ( where particles undergo advection and dispersion processes : the so - called mobile phase ) .",
    "the aim of our work is to provide a generalization of the f - mim approach to the case of non - constant flows , and space - dependent sorption rates , which can commonly arise in transport experiments .",
    "non - uniformity can occur in both field and laboratory scale measures , and may involve also sharp discontinuities in the physical properties of the traversed media . based on a small - scale description of particles trajectories , we will derive the corresponding governing equations for the macroscopic quantities , namely the mobile and immobile densities , in such a way that non - constant coefficients are easily taken into account . in the case of constant velocity field and uniform",
    "sorption , similar results were obtained via subordination theory  @xcite , along the strategy proposed in  @xcite . in the case of non - constant coefficients ,",
    "stronger arguments have to be used . finally , in order to corroborate the proposed results",
    ", we will compare monte carlo particle - tracking simulations of solutes spatial profiles and btcs with the numerical solutions of the governing equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ mim_model ] we recall the small - scale model for flow with trapping processes in porous media , on the basis of the f - mim formalism , and provide an extension to non - constant flows .",
    "then , in sec .  [ densities ] , we derive the densities of the mobile and immobile contaminant phases at small scale , and in sec .",
    "[ equations ] the corresponding governing equations in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "these equations are discretized and solved numerically , and the obtained solutions are compared with monte carlo simulations results in sec .",
    "[ montecarlo ] .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "as customary , we begin by representing the stochastic trajectory of a contaminant particle in a porous medium as a random walk @xmath2 undergoing advection and dispersion .",
    "superscripts @xmath3 denote the characteristic length and time scales , respectively , of the process .",
    "first , we briefly recall the essential features of the standard gaussian models that usually describe small - scale displacements of a contaminant plume in homogeneous saturated materials . then , we focus on heterogeneous and/or unsaturated media , where the broad distribution of permeabilities and different flow regions experienced by the tracers is mirrored in the possibility of trapping events at each visited spatial site , the walkers dynamics being otherwise similar to that observed in homogeneous materials .",
    "these trapping events affect the sojourn times and thus alter the typical scales of average displacement ( i.e. , velocity ) and spread ( i.e. , dispersion ) of the contaminant plume .",
    "for homogeneous saturated materials , it is usually possible to identify an average flow field @xmath4 , so that at each time step @xmath5 $ ] particles are advected over a distance @xmath6 .",
    "dispersion is usually taken into account by adding random ( symmetrical ) jumps of characteristic length scale @xmath7 to the advective contribution @xmath8 . the total displacement during @xmath9 can be therefore written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a random number drawn from a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath12 with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "it follows that @xmath13 is the density of @xmath14 .",
    "usually , one assumes that @xmath15 is a normal pdf with zero mean and standard deviation equal to @xmath7 , which means that the typical scale of fluctuations around the average particle displacement is @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known that the scaling ( hydrodynamic ) limit of such ( independent ) random walks is attained when @xmath16 in such a way that the ratio @xmath17 converges to some limit @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 defines the dispersion coefficient . under this scaling limit and",
    "when @xmath19 is constant , the stochastic process @xmath2 asymptotically approaches the brownian motion ( bm ) @xmath20 with drift , whose concentration @xmath21 ( i.e. , the probability density of finding a walker at position @xmath22 at a given time @xmath23 ) is shown to satisfy the following fokker - planck equation ( fpe )  @xcite @xmath24 note that the fpe   is equivalent to the advection - dispersion equation ( ade ) when @xmath18 is uniform  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 depends on @xmath22 , eq .   still represents the hydrodynamic limit of random walks as above , satisfying @xmath25  @xcite . for sake of simplicity ,",
    "in the following we will refer to the case where @xmath18 is uniform , i.e. , @xmath26 . by virtue of the central limit theorem",
    ", the results recalled above actually apply more generally to a broad class of random walks where @xmath15 is a generic symmetric jump length pdf with finite second moment .",
    "after a sufficient number of displacements , these processes all converge to bm in the hydrodynamic limit ( provided that the variance of the process is equal to @xmath27 , and with constant @xmath19 ) .",
    "the fact that bm is the basin of attraction of a large spectrum of random walks , independently of the specific choice of the jump length pdf , can explain the success of eq .   in interpreting experimental contaminant transport data , at least limited to homogeneous saturated materials  @xcite .",
    "remark also that eq .   can be derived by building upon a constitutive relationship for the particles flux ( probability current ) @xmath28 of the process @xmath2 , as recalled in appendix  [ d ] . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", the flux converges to @xmath29 which is the well - known fick s law for homogeneous @xmath18 .",
    "then , mass conservation principle @xmath30 yields eq .  .",
    "this holds for infinite domains , or for domains limited by absorbing boundary conditions ( walkers are removed upon touching the barriers ) . for detailed accounts concerning the derivation of eq .  ,",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "suppose now that the traversed material is affected by small - scale heterogeneities .",
    "for instance , we might consider unsaturated porous media with variable saturation , where particles may be retained by stagnation regions  @xcite .",
    "we might also think of biophysical effects in porous materials  @xcite , or chemical reactions taking place on the surface of a duct traversed by fluid flow . the homogeneous random walk proposed above",
    "is evidently inadequate to address such situations . from the point of view of microscopic trajectories ,",
    "a natural means of accounting for sorption is that walkers are given the possibility of being trapped at the end of each displacement , i.e. , upon reaching a new spatial site .",
    "the trapping probability @xmath31 is for sake of generality space - dependent , since traps may be non - uniformly distributed .",
    "previously ,  @xcite considered constant trapping probabilities .",
    "we further assume that the sojourn time at the traps is itself a random variable @xmath32 .",
    "experimental evidences suggest that these retention times lack a characteristic scale ( i.e. , their average is not defined ) , so that it is commonly assumed that @xmath32 obeys a power - law decaying pdf  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the scaled variable @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a random number obeying a pdf @xmath35 and @xmath36 a scaling exponent , and denote by @xmath37 the associated survival probability , @xmath38 . the quantity",
    "@xmath39 expresses the probability that the trapping time is longer than @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that the rescaled pdf of @xmath32 is @xmath40 , and the rescaled survival probability is @xmath41 .",
    "we make now the following hypothesis for the pdf of the retention times : + @xmath42 ) the pdf @xmath35 is concentrated on @xmath43 , with survival probability of the kind @xmath44 , @xmath45 being a function integrable over @xmath43 , with @xmath46 .",
    "+ assumption @xmath42 is satisfied by pdfs whose asymptotic behavior is a power - law . for instance , we might consider pareto laws  @xcite , or maximally skewed lvy laws with exponent @xmath36 , which are concentrated on @xmath43 precisely for @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the exponent @xmath36 quantifies the degree of heterogeneity of the porous media : small values of @xmath36 denote strong deviations from the usual gaussian transport model , i.e. , anomalously long retention times .",
    "while the retention times correspond to the immobilization of the walkers ( immobile phase ) , a more precise description of the time spent during displacements ( mobile phase ) is needed .",
    "several scenarios can be conceived , depending on the time of occurrence of the dispersive jump within a mobile period @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "for instance , the jump could take place instantaneously at the beginning of the period , or at the end ; or it could occur at a random time , uniformly distributed in @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "also , we could imagine that the jump is not instantaneous , and takes the whole time span @xmath5 $ ] to be completed . on the other hand , the endpoints of successive displacements",
    "do not depend on the considered scenario , nor are trapping events affected .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ a ] , all these possible small - scale random walks converge to the same scaling limit when @xmath48 .",
    "then , for convenience we will focus on the simplest case : we assume that walkers perform a single instantaneous dispersive jump during the time interval @xmath9 , taking place at the end of each mobile period .",
    "finally , for sake of generality , we also introduce a ( possibly time- and space - dependent ) source term @xmath49 , representing tracer injection .    in the following",
    ", we will show that in the hydrodynamic limit the walkers density @xmath21 for the process described above satisfies @xmath50 in eq .  , the non - local in time operator @xmath51 is the inverse of the ( also non - local in time ) mapping @xmath52 , which entails the fractional integral of order @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 , whose definition is recalled in appendix  [ b ] . here @xmath55 denotes the identity operator and @xmath56 is a constant parameter .",
    "in fact , as shown in  @xcite , @xmath51 is the time convolution of the kernel @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the mittag - leffler function described in  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that eq .",
    "governs the evolution of the particles concentration for constant @xmath19 and uniform @xmath18 , with @xmath59 , building upon the results of  @xcite ; for this case , and assuming @xmath60 , eq .   is equivalent to the fractal mim model @xmath61 introduced in  @xcite , where @xmath62 is the caputo derivative of order @xmath36 ( see appendix  [ b ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath63 characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the trapping times pdf ( in @xmath42 ) , and also the scaling of the plume spread ; in this sense , @xmath36 is the signature of the anomalous transport process . indeed , the solutions of eq .",
    "have been shown to decrease at large times as @xmath64  @xcite , which could possibly explain the long tails experimentally observed , e.g. , by  @xcite and  @xcite . in unbounded domains , and with constant and uniform coefficients , the spatial moments of the solute concentration in eq .",
    "were shown to decrease as powers of time related to the exponent @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "as a special limit , setting @xmath65 in eq .",
    "yields the well - known mim model with retardation factor @xmath66  @xcite , which corresponds to tracers experiencing random retention periods with finite characteristic ( mean ) duration , comparable to the time spent in the average flow field . nevertheless , the solutions of the mim model or the ade   fall off much more rapidly than any power of @xmath23 and are thus inadequate to interpret experimental data showing heavy tails such as those of  @xcite .",
    "we will see further below that , rather than representing the hydrodynamic limit of random walks satisfying @xmath42 with @xmath65 , the mim model corresponds to a pdf @xmath35 with a finite average .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 determines the relevance of the retention mechanism with respect to the fickian transport : when @xmath68 , all equations above collapse to the ade .",
    "moreover , it provides the scaling parameter for @xmath35 , and carries dimensions of a power @xmath36 of time .",
    "this is easily seen in the laplace space , where @xmath69 in the limit @xmath70 , according to @xmath42 .",
    "particles performing such random walks with sorption can conceptually be separated into two distinct ` phases ' : at each time step , walkers that are trapped are said to be in the immobile phase , whereas walkers that are not are said to be in the mobile phase . in the following ,",
    "we proceed to derive an explicit relation that links the particles densities in the two phases , for definite values of length- and time - scales @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit will be addressed in next section .",
    "let @xmath71 be the density of trapped particles , at location @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , and @xmath72 the density of mobile walkers .",
    "in order to establish the desired relation between the two spatial densities @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we make use of the ancillary pdfs @xmath75 of just arriving at point @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , and @xmath76 of just being released by a sorbing site at time @xmath23 .    except",
    "just after having been injected into the system , mobile particles at position @xmath22 at time @xmath23 have two alternatives .",

    "we illustrate this case by considering a @xmath160 domain of length @xmath161 , whose left portion @xmath166 $ ] is characterized by @xmath165 , and whose right portion @xmath167 $ ] is characterized by @xmath143 .",
    "we assume @xmath168 and set absorbing boundary conditions at both ends of the domain .",
    "a point - source is located in @xmath169 at time @xmath170 , i.e. , the particles are injected in the homogeneous and saturated region . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display the spatial concentration profiles for the total tracers concentration @xmath21 ( at fixed times ) .",
    "the most striking feature of this transport process is the appearance of discontinuities in the resident concentration profiles at the interface between the two portions of the domain , whereas the profiles displayed in  @xcite for @xmath171 are continuous .",
    "this behavior has already been reported elsewhere in the context of the ctrw formulation ( see , e.g. , the discussions in  @xcite ) , and may be understood in terms of the two layers having distinct apparent porosities .",
    "in fact , particles experience different trapping times in each layer , and the abrupt variation of the sojourn times distribution at the interface ultimately gives rise to sharp mass accumulation at the interface , as the particles flow is somehow hindered when going from the region with short retention times to the region with long retention times  @xcite .",
    "while the implementation of random walks for this case is straightforward , some care is necessary in discretizing densities for numerical integration .",
    "more precisely , the total concentration @xmath21 is discontinuous at @xmath172 , hence directly discretizing eq .",
    "is not convenient . using instead eq .  , which links @xmath173 and @xmath142 , and then fick s law applied to @xmath142 , is much more expedient , because @xmath142 is smooth .",
    "combining eqs .   and   yields @xmath174 \\label{eqmimpm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is easily discretized following the same lines as in  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we display the spatial concentration profiles @xmath175 for the mobile tracers concentration ( at fixed times ) . in this case , the curves are smooth across the interface .",
    "this is because the particles flux satisfies fick s law , as applied to @xmath142 , and the ade does not allow for concentration discontinuities at the interface .",
    "indeed , the flux contrasts local variations of @xmath142 .",
    "suppose that the profiles of @xmath173 and @xmath142 have slopes of different signs ( e.g. , positive for @xmath142 and negative for @xmath173 ) at @xmath22 : then , the particles flux through @xmath22 is negative , and flattens out the spatial increase of @xmath142 . on the contrary ,",
    "the spatial decrease of @xmath173 has no direct effect on the flux , which therefore does not act on this quantity . for both total and mobile concentrations , a very good agreement is found between monte carlo simulations and numerically integrated equations . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the breakthrough curves at the column right outlet , for different values of the exponent @xmath36 in the absorbing region : again , good agreement is found between monte carlo simulations and numerically integrated equations . the asymptotic behavior described by  @xcite in infinite domains with @xmath176",
    "is recovered : even with @xmath177 in some intervals only , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 when @xmath181 . while density profiles obtained for a given value of @xmath36 with arbitrary @xmath31 show qualitative differences , fluxes look similar . hence , btcs alone are not enough to discriminate between cases .",
    "in this work , we have discussed a model of contaminant particles flow with trapping events in porous media . building on the framework of the fractal mim model , which describes advection - dispersion processes with sticking events in homogeneous flows , we have considered time - varying velocities and space - dependent sticking probabilities .",
    "we have first derived the small scale particles dynamics , on the base of a functional relationship between the densities of trapped and non - trapped walkers .",
    "this relationship stems directly from the asymptotic behavior of the trapping times distribution , and gives rise to a modified fick s law with memory for particles fluxes .",
    "then , recalling mass conservation principle , we have obtained the corresponding governing equations for the evolution of the mobile and immobile phases densities .",
    "these equations have been derived by considering the hydrodynamic ( scaling ) limit of the underlying microscopic stochastic processes , i.e. , by letting the space and time scale of the particles displacements be vanishing small , while preserving the macroscopic dispersion and advection coefficients .",
    "the transport equations , which contain non - local in time kernels in the form of fractional integrals , have been discretized and solved numerically by resorting to ad hoc algorithms . finally , in order to corroborate our results , the contaminant concentration profiles and the breakthrough curves thus obtained by numerical integration have been compared with monte carlo particle - tracking simulations .",
    "the relevance and broad applicability of the transport equation   for the case of non - constant parameters have been emphasized in both theoretical derivations and numerical examples . in particular , we have addressed the case of time - varying velocity fields @xmath4 and space - dependent trapping probabilities @xmath31 . in fact , the method developed here is more general , and may apply also when the equation coefficients ( e.g. , @xmath136 ) depend on the densities of trapped and mobile walkers , which would result in a nonlinear version of eq .  , similarly as in  @xcite .",
    "further extensions of our work will address the coexistence of several kinds of traps within the same porous medium , each trap being characterized by a distinct sticking time pdf .",
    "this approach would then give rise to slightly more complex mappings @xmath51 with fractional integrals of distributed order  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case would correspond to two kinds of traps occurring with probabilities @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively , and sticking time pdfs @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( satisfying hypothesis @xmath42 with @xmath186 ) .",
    "such a model could represent , e.g. , multiple phases or regions , with distinct retention properties .",
    "then , the residence times of the solutes would be governed by the mapping @xmath187 , defined as being the inverse of @xmath188 . moreover , while at intermediate times the solute dynamics is rather involved , at late times the total density would asymptotically decrease as @xmath189 , i.e. , transport would be dominated by the ` slower ' retention process .",
    "during a given mobile displacement between times @xmath96 and @xmath23 , we have a single dispersive jump , whose length is a random variable obeying @xmath117 . at the scale of microscopic particles trajectories , diverse scenarios may be conceived , which we denote by label @xmath190 .",
    "let @xmath191 be the associated walkers paths .",
    "the source of randomness in each sample @xmath192 arises from the series of successive dispersive jump lengths @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) and from that of trapping times @xmath195 ; for convenience , we set @xmath196 if there is no trapping event after the @xmath197-th mobile period . concerning dispersion , we might consider instantaneous jumps , occurring at the end of each mobile period @xmath198 , at the beginning @xmath199 , or at a random time uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath5 $ ] @xmath200 .",
    "alternatively , the dispersive jump might be thought of as being distributed along the total displacement , taking therefore a time @xmath5 $ ] to be completed @xmath201 .",
    "each @xmath192 corresponds to two sequences of numbers , that are the values drawn for the @xmath193 and @xmath195 .",
    "of course , these points are identical for all the trajectories @xmath191 started from @xmath150 at time @xmath170 .",
    "all trajectories pass through points @xmath202 and @xmath203 , with @xmath204 and @xmath205 : trapping periods correspond to segments beginning at point @xmath202 , and ending at @xmath206 , that are common to all scenarios .",
    "hence , the immobile walkers density @xmath71 does not depend on the scenario .",
    "moreover , @xmath207 when @xmath23 belongs to a trapping period , and @xmath208 when @xmath23 belongs to the @xmath197-th mobile period . jumps @xmath193 obey @xmath117 , and ( weakly ) converge to zero when @xmath131 .",
    "hence , theorem @xmath209 of  @xcite implies that , if one among the possible processes @xmath210 converges to the scaling limit @xmath20 when @xmath131 , then the same holds for all the other paths @xmath210 .",
    "hence , it follows that the walkers density @xmath21 does not depend on the specific scenario in the hydrodynamic limit , nor does the immobile walkers concentration @xmath211 .",
