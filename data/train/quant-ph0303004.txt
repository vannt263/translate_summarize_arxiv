    "a general problem in quantum optics is the implementation of a defined single- or multi - mode operator by some physical scheme since many efforts amount to the realization of a desired quantum state transformation of an unknown or control of a known signal quantum state @xcite . here , we limit attention to a physical system consisting of a number of traveling light pulses described by non - monochromatic signal modes .",
    "we assume that the spatial pulse length is large compared to the wavelength of the radiation , so that we deal with quasi - monochromatic pulses corresponding to quasi - orthogonal modes .",
    "a difficulty is that at present , only a limited set of basic operations can be implemented directly .",
    "composite operations therefore have to be constructed from elementary ones which are simple enough to allow their direct realization .",
    "examples of such basic operations are the preparation of coherent ( i.e. , glauber ) states by single - mode lasers , or single - photon states by parametric down converters , furthermore parametric interactions as realized by beam splitters , three - wave mixers , and kerr - nonlinearities , and the discrimination between presence and absence of photons by means of binary 0 - 1-photodetectors such as avalanche photodiodes .",
    "a simple combination of these techniques allows further manipulations such as parametric amplification , coherent displacement , or the preparation and detection of photon number ( i.e. , fock ) states @xcite .    to give an example",
    ", the signal pulse may be sent through a medium applied in the parametric approximation , i.e. , the medium realizes a weak coupling between the signal modes and a number of auxiliary modes prepared in strong coherent states . since within classical optics ,",
    "@xmath0th - order interactions are described as a @xmath0th - order deviation from linearity of the polarization induced in a medium by an electric field , the interaction strength is expected to decline rapidly with increasing order .",
    "strong fields are therefore required for their observation .",
    "in contrast , setups discussed within quantum optics and quantum information processing often operate with superpositions of low - excited fock states while the coherent amplitudes in the auxiliary modes can not be increased unlimited to achieve a desired interaction strength of the reduced signal operation .",
    "this greatly limits the order of the nonlinearity applicable and with it the variety of unitary transformations that can be realized by a given medium .",
    "desirable are therefore substituting schemes for such nonlinear interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , one may apply the nonlinearity hidden in the quantum measurement process and to use merely passive optical elements such as beam splitters @xcite and photodetectors while relying on simple auxiliary preparations such as coherent and single - photon states @xcite .",
    "a local measurement performed on a spatially extended quantum system affects the reduced state at the other locations . by repeated measurements and postselection of desired detection events , this back - action caused by a measurement",
    "can then be used to perform well - defined manipulations , including state preparations @xcite , quantum logic operations @xcite , state purifications @xcite , quantum error corrections @xcite , and state detections @xcite .",
    "the simplest basic operations one may think of are the application of the mode operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , photon subtraction and addition @xcite . with regard to compositions , it is necessary to limit operation to a suitably chosen finite - dimensional subspace of the system s hilbert space , cf . , e.g. , @xcite , since only a finite number of parameters can be controlled .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate a theoretical possibility of implementing a desired single- or multi - mode operation @xmath3 on the quantum state @xmath4 of a traveling optical signal .",
    "the scheme solely relies on beam splitters as well as zero- and single - photon detections .",
    "in this way , nonlinear and active optical elements can be avoided .",
    "it requires the preparation of coherent states and single - photon states , however .",
    "the idea is to start with a single photon , which is then manipulated to construct an entangled @xmath5-mode state .",
    "after that , the latter is shared by local setups performing the transformation in the signal modes .",
    "the measurement - assisted and hence conditional transformation leads to an output state @xmath6 where the normalization constant @xmath7 is the probability of the respective measurement result , i.e. the .",
    "in particular , if the operator @xmath3 is proportional to a unitary one , @xmath3 @xmath8 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath8 @xmath11 , then the success probability is independent of the input state ,",
    "@xmath12 @xmath8 @xmath13",
    ".    within the scope of explaining the principle , we limit attention to idealized optical devices , as the effect of imperfections depends on the desired transformation and the signal state itself . in a given practical setup , the imperfections and the resulting coupling of the system to its environment must be considered since loss of only one photon may change the phase in a superposition of two states and yield wrong results . apart from this , the mode matching becomes an important issue especially in the case of composite devices such as optical multiports .",

    "section  [ sec2 ] describes the local devices which mix the signal pulses and an entangled state in order to perform the desired transformation of the signal , whereas section  [ sec3 ] is dedicated to the preparation of the entangled state itself .",
