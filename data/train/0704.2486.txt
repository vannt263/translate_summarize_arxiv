    "a number of correlations between intrinsic properties of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been discovered since it has become possible to measure their distances . in particular , correlations between properties of the @xmath0-ray prompt emission as well as of the afterglow at different wavelengths have provided an increasing number of clues to identify the mechanisms and , ultimately , the nature of the grb progenitors .",
    "in addition , some of these correlations have been tentatively used as luminosity estimators , with several implications on their possible usage to constrain the cosmology of the universe @xcite .",
    "the increasing number of grbs with spectroscopic redshift allows to test and better calibrate them .",
    "recently , a crucial contribution has been supplied by the _",
    "satellite @xcite , whose average rate of 100  grbs per year since launch ( november 2004 ) made it possible to measure the distances of almost 1/3 of its sample , thus duplicating the overall number of grbs with known redshift since 1997 .    the sample of grbs detected with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) is particularly suitable to test the correlations between intrinsic properties , with the unprecedented benefit of a homogeneous data set , apart from those requiring the peak energy measurement , made difficult by the limited energy band ( 15350  kev ) .",
    "hereafter we focus on a long - standing correlation between the variability and peak luminosity of the @xmath0-ray prompt emission @xcite .",
    "in particular , reichart et  al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter r01 ) provided a definition of variability ( hereafter denoted as @xmath3 ) that turned out to correlate with the isotropic - equivalent rest - frame 1001000  kev peak luminosity ( hereafter @xmath4 ) for a sample of 11 grbs with known redshift available at the time , using data from the _",
    "cgro_/batse experiment @xcite .",
    "r01 modelled the variability / peak luminosity correlation ( hereafter @xmath5 correlation ) with a power law ( @xmath6 ) with @xmath7 ) affected by _",
    "extrinsic _ or _ sample _",
    "scatter , described by @xmath8 .",
    "recently , guidorzi et  al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter gfm05 ) and guidorzi ( 2005 ; hereafter g05 ) tested the @xmath5 correlation on an extended sample of 32 grbs with known redshift ( gfm05 ) and on 551 batse grbs , respectively .",
    "for the latters , a pseudo - redshift was derived assuming the lag - luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "both works confirmed the correlation , but with a lower slope than that derived by r01 : @xmath9 ( gfm05 ) and @xmath10 ( g05 ) .",
    "however , in either case it was pointed out that the scatter around these power laws made the description of a simple power law unsatisfactory .",
    "@xcite applied the same method as r01 to the very results obtained by gfm05 , obtaining @xmath11 and @xmath12 , perfectly in agreement with the original values of r01 .",
    "they ascribed the disagreement to the fact that gfm05 did not deal with the sample variance properly .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied the dagostini ( 2005 ) method , accounting for the sample variance , to the data sets of both gfm05 and g05 .",
    "they obtained shallower slopes than those by r01 and @xcite and larger scatters : in particular , for the sample of 32 grbs with firm redshift drawn from gfm05 they obtained @xmath13 , @xmath14 , while for the sample of 551 grbs with pseudo - redshifts of g05 it resulted @xmath15 , @xmath16 .    for more details on the debate concerning the methods to be used , we refer the reader to the original papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "li & paczyski ( 2006 ; hereafter lp06 ) have recently provided a slightly modified definition of variability , hereafter denoted as @xmath17 , which they found to correlate more tightly with @xmath4 than @xmath3 , without any extrinsic scatter in addition to the uncertainties affecting the single values of the single grbs .",
    "@xmath17 differs from @xmath3 mainly in the choice of the smoothing filter determining the reference light curve with respect to which the variance is evaluated .",
    "lp06 chose the savitzy - golay filter instead of a simple boxcar used by r01 .",
    "as a result , @xmath17 selects only the high frequencies , whereas only in the @xmath3 calculation the lower frequency variance can give a contribution .",
    "the variability of the @xmath0-ray prompt emission light curves is supposed to be produced above the photospheric radius of the fireball , above which radiation becomes optically thin .",
    "the interpretations proposed of the @xmath5 correlation mainly invoke the presence of a jet , whose angle @xmath18 , i.e. either the opening angle or the viewing angle ( e.g. , see ioka & nakamura 2001 ) for some jet patterns , is strongly connected with the observed peak luminosity @xmath4 as well as with the lorentz factor @xmath19 of the expanding shell(s ) .",
    "the result would be a strong dependence of both @xmath20 and @xmath21 on @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , @xcite reproduced the observed correlation through numerical simulations , assuming @xmath22 and a log - uniform distribution in the time delay between next shells , from 1  ms to 1  s. a value of @xmath23 seems to account well for the results by @xcite as well as the anti - correlation between break time and peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite and @xcite under slightly different assumptions .",
    "the new piece of information from this analysis is given by the presence of low - luminosity high - variability grbs .",
    "in this paper , we test the @xmath5 correlation on a homogeneous sample of 41  grbs detected with _ swift_/bat using fully homogeneous data .",
    "we considered two different definitions of variability : that by r01 and that by lp06 . in section  [ s : sample ] we describe the data sample and the selections we made .",
    "sections  [ s : lum_peak ] and [ s : v ] report how peak luminosity and variability have been calculated .",
    "results are reported in sec .",
    "[ s : res ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : disc ] .",
    "the sample includes 51 long ( @xmath24s ) grbs with spectroscopic redshift detected by _",
    "swift_/bat @xcite between the launch ( 2004 , november 20 ) and october 2006 . out of this sample",
    "we selected only those bursts whose @xmath0-ray profile is entirely covered by bat during the burst mode @xcite .",
    "no further selection was made on the sample , in order to avoid any arbitrary bias in the results .",
    "this requirement resulted in the rejection of 10 grbs .",
    "in fact , in these cases the observation of _",
    "swift_/bat switched from burst mode to the survey mode before of the end of the prompt emission . the light curve results with a truncated profile .",
    "this is the case of grb  050318 , whose light curve stops about 32  s after the trigger , as well as of grb  050820a , grb  050904 and grb  060218 . for grb",
    "060124 only the precursor was recorded in event mode , while the main event was observed in survey mode . for grb  060906 the light curve is incomplete at the beginning , because the trigger probably missed the true onset of the burst .",
    "no burst mode event file is available for grb  060505 , as bat observed it only in survey mode .",
    "we chose not to make use of the background subtracted light curves acquired during the survey mode to keep the sample as homogeneous as possible .",
    "grb  050408 was detected by xrt and uvot , but not by bat , although the light curve of its prompt emission is available from other instruments ( _ hete-2/fregate _ ; atteia et  al .",
    "nevertheless , we did not consider it in this work because we focused on bat data for the reasons reported above . in the case of grb  050802 and grb  051227a",
    "the problem is in the redshift determination . for the former only a tentative",
    "redshift exists @xcite , which is at odds with the interpretation of the _ swift_/uvot results @xcite . for grb  051227a",
    "there is a redshift determination of the putative host galaxy @xcite , but it is still unclear if this is the real host galaxy .    after this selection",
    "the sample has shrunk to 41 long grbs , entirely covered by bat and processed through the same procedure .",
    "therefore , this work investigates the @xmath5 relation based on a completely homogeneous sample .",
    "the bat event files were retrieved from the _ swift _ public archive and analysed through the standard bat analysis software distributed within ftools v6.1 . for each grb we extracted mask - tagged light curves for a number of different binning times in the total nominal energy band ( @xmath25@xmath26  kev),@xmath27  kev , because photons with energy above @xmath27  kev become transparent to the coded mask and",
    "are treated as background by the mask - weighting technique ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "2006 ) . ] through the tool _ batmaskwtevt _ adopting the ground - refined coordinates provided by the bat team for each burst .",
    "these curves are therefore already background subtracted according to the coded mask technique ( barthelmy et al . 2005 and references therein ) . for each burst",
    "the bat detector quality map was obtained by processing the next earlier enable / disable map of the detectors , telling which detectors were disabled in flight because too noisy .",
    "we also applied the energy calibration to the event file making use of the closest - in - time gain / offset file through the tool _ bateconvert _ , as suggested by the bat team .",
    "finally these light curves are expressed as count rates with uncertainties : the rates are background - subtracted counts per second per fully illuminated detector for an equivalent on - axis source , as the default corrections are applied : _ ndets , pcode , maskwt , flatfield_.    we also studied the behaviour of the background fluctuations in burstless regions of the light curves and we found that the mask - tagged rates , @xmath28 , fluctuate compatibly with a white noise with sigma @xmath29 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the rate and its uncertainty of the @xmath30-th bin , respectively ; see appendix ) .",
    "we concluded that an upper limit of @xmath31  24% ( 46% ) at 90% ( 99% ) confidence level can be derived on the presence of a possible extra variance ( of instrumental origin , for instance ) in addition to that due to the poisson counting statistics , implicitly assumed during the light curve extraction with the tool _",
    "batbinevt_.    we found that it is not correct to perform the same analysis on bat light curves with raw counts , i.e. not masked .",
    "in fact , we found that the grb profile itself can be dramatically contaminated by other sources and by background variations , with time , due to the slewing of the spacecraft during the prompt emission , for most grbs .",
    "furthermore , we found that bat light curves with raw counts are severely affected by extra variance , which is comparable with the poisson variance due to the counting statistics , in agreement with previous results ( lp06 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the bat light curves of most grbs with raw counts , not masked , are not suitable for temporal variability studies .",
    "for each grb we extracted the mask - tagged light curve with a binning time of @xmath32  ms in the 15350  kev energy band . we determined the 1-s time interval with the highest total counts and assumed this as the time interval corresponding to the 1-s peak count rate .",
    "we extracted the mask weighted spectrum in this time interval using the tool _",
    "batbinevt_. we applied all the corrections required : we updated it through _ batupdatephakw _ and generated the detector response matrix using _",
    "batdrmgen_. then we used _",
    "batphasyserr _ in order to account for the bat systematics as a function of energy .",
    "finally we grouped the energy channels of the spectrum by imposing a 5-@xmath33 ( or 3-@xmath33 when",
    "the s / n was too low ) threshold on each grouped channel .",
    "we fitted the resulting photon spectrum , @xmath34 ( ph @xmath35s@xmath2kev@xmath2 ) , with a power law with pegged normalisation ( pegpwrlw model under xspec v.12 ) , except for grb  050525a and grb  060927 where a cutoff power law was used , in the rest - frame energy band @xmath36  kev .",
    "the choice of the energy band is connected with the original definition by r01 ( see their eq .",
    "9 ) also used by gfm05 ( their eq .  7 ) .",
    "therefore the grbs rest - frame @xmath36-kev isotropic - equivalent peak luminosities were computed using : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath39 , @xmath40 is energy expressed in kev .",
    "finally we derived the uncertainty on the peak luminosity by propagating that of the measured flux .",
    "concerning the six bat grbs shared with the sample of gfm05 , we compared the two sets of peak luminosities : these grbs are 050315 , 050319 , 050401 , 050505 , 050525a and 050603 .",
    "they are consistent with those of gfm05 , apart from two cases . for 050401",
    "our @xmath41 measure , where @xmath42 , is @xmath43 , while gfm05 reported @xmath44 . for 050603",
    ", we obtained @xmath45 to be compared with gfm05 s @xmath46 .",
    "the reason in either case resides in a slightly different choice of the 1-s time interval around the peak .",
    "gfm05 determined this from the 40350  kev light curve to match the 40700  kev of the _ bepposax_/grbm , while we used the 15350  kev .",
    "the choices of the 1-s time interval turned out to differ by 12  s in either case .",
    "this , combined with the fact that both of these grbs exhibit a sharp peak , turned into the discrepancies provided above .",
    "we note that in both cases they still lie in the @xmath3-@xmath4 region with high @xmath3 and high @xmath4 , consistently with the @xmath5 correlation .",
    "the main difference between our data set and those used by r01 and gfm05 is that our light curves are expressed in background - subtracted rates and not in counts .",
    "this fact is due to the way bat , which is a coded mask , has been conceived .",
    "hereafter we assumed a poissonian variance for the statistical fluctuations of the light curves , as we proved in appendix a. the formula we used to compute the variability , according to the r01 definition , is basically the same as those of r01 and gfm05 , with no extra - poissonian noise term , given that our rates are already background - subtracted .",

    "the differences between our formula , eq .  7 of r01 and eq",
    ".  4 of gfm05 , are the replacement of the counts @xmath50 with the rates @xmath51 in the first terms of both numerator and denominator , where the original @xmath50 represented the grb signal , and the replacement of the counts @xmath50 with the statistical noise variances @xmath52 affecting the rates @xmath51 in the terms to be subtracted , where the original counts @xmath50 represented the noise .",
    "the sum , @xmath53 , runs over the @xmath54 bins encompassing the grb time profile .",
    "the background term @xmath55 in the original formulae of r01 has been set to zero , as it has already been removed during the extraction of the light curves .    for each grb we estimated the smoothing time scale @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , defined by r01 as the shortest cumulative time interval during which a fraction @xmath58 of the total counts above background has been collected .",
    "for each grb we calculated @xmath56 and the corresponding variability @xmath3 as a function of the binning time .",
    "we chose the values obtained with the binning time @xmath59 that fulfilled the requirements reported by gfm05 concerning the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "on one side , when this ratio is too small , the light curve is dominated by statistical fluctuations , while , on the other side , when the binning is too coarse the variability is underestimated .",
    "a detailed description of these criteria is provided by gfm05 .      concerning the definition of variability given by lp06 , hereafter denoted by @xmath17",
    ", we point out a number of different choices with respect to the their analysis .",
    "first we estimated @xmath17 from the background - subtracted mask - tagged light curves , while lp06 used the raw counts light curves of the 7 _ swift_/bat grbs of their sample ( li , private comm . ) .",
    "we assumed no extra - poissonian variance to be subtracted , unlike lp06 .",
    "we adapted eqs .",

    "@xmath65 is the same weight as that used by lp06 and accounts for the fact that the set of @xmath66 is not completely statistically independent from @xmath67 . as for the determination of the peak count rate , @xmath68 , we searched the light curve of the same grb a number of times , each time increasing the binning time , until we found the peak 5-@xmath33 higher than the contiguous bins .",
    "this turned out to be very accurate , particularly for weak grbs . in order to comply with the procedure of lp06",

    "likewise , if we merge the two samples ( gfm05 s and ours ) we obtain similar results : when the 7 bursts with @xmath278 are taken out from the total sample of 62 grbs , the correlation becomes significant with a no - correlation probability of @xmath279 according to the non - parametric tests .    finally , we calculated @xmath3 in the 25350  kev energy band , i.e. ignoring the lowest energy channel 1525  kev , of the six low - luminosity outliers .",
    "the aim was to establish the importance of the low - energy channel contribution to the resulting @xmath3 , especially when compared with the results of gfm05 , whose low - energy threshold was 40  kev .",
    "we found that in all cases @xmath3 resulted systematically higher , although still compatible within uncertainties .",
    "the only case in which @xmath3 in the 25350  kev was significantly higher than for the whole band was 060614 due to its small statistical uncertainty .",
    "this corroborates the nature of outliers of the six grbs considered : we can rule out that their high values of @xmath3 are due to the presence of the low - energy photons not considered by previous data sets .",
    "significant values of @xmath17 have been obtained only for 10 grbs shown in fig .",
    "[ f : lp_varlum ] . in the remaining 31 cases the variability resulted consistent with zero within uncertainties ( see table  [ table : results ] ) .",
    "despite the small number of grbs with significant @xmath17 , the correlation appears to be significant within 12% according to the non - parametric tests : 1.1% ( spearman ) and 1.6% ( kendall ) .",
    "see table  [ tab : corr_coeff ] for further details .",
    "figure  [ f : lp_varlum ] shows these 10 bat grbs as well as the sample of 22 grbs of lp06 .",
    "shaded areas show the 1-@xmath33 and 2-@xmath33 regions around the best - fitting power law obtained by lp06 using the _ fitexy _ routine , with a slope of @xmath280 and a @xmath281 ( 20 dof ) .",
    "if we ignore grb  060614 , which clearly lies far away from any power - law correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath4 , and use the same routine as lp06 , we obtain a best - fitting value of the slope of @xmath282 and @xmath283 ( 7 dof ) .",
    "the @xmath284 is clearly too high and therefore , although the correlation appears to be real , the description in terms of a power - law with no sample scatter , as the usage of the routine _ fitexy _ assumes , is not acceptable .",
    "we note that this conclusion also holds for the very same result of lp06 , whose @xmath284 has a null hypothesis probability of 0.75% .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     results are reported in table  [ tab : epi ] .",

    "[ f : epi ] .",
    "the better consistency with the @xmath285-@xmath286 than with the @xmath285-@xmath4 correlation can be explained with the fact that @xmath285 better correlates with the time integrated released energy , as proven also by the scatter of the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath286 @xcite .",

    "apparently there is no hint for correlation and also no evidence for a different behaviour of the 6 low - luminosity grbs with respect to the others .",
    "the result does not change in essence when we replace @xmath288 with @xmath69 .",
    "we conclude that the fact that the variability of these 6 low - luminosity high - variability grbs does not correlate with the peak luminosity is not connected with their @xmath285 , which correlates with @xmath286 as almost all of the long grbs with known redshift @xcite .",

    "the most interesting results have been derived with @xmath3 . if we consider only the grbs with peak luminosity @xmath4 comparable with those of previous samples , i.e. @xmath289  erg  s@xmath2 in the rest - frame 1001000  kev energy band , we confirm the correlation and its intrinsic dispersion around the best - fitting power law obtained by @xcite : @xmath13 ( @xmath290 ) and @xmath291 .",
    "interestingly , all of the 6 low - luminosity grbs detected by _",
    "swift_/bat turn out to be outliers to the @xmath5 correlation , showing higher values of @xmath3 than expected .",
    "this does not contradict the results from previous samples of grbs with known redshift .",
    "instead , we are led to conclude that the correlation does not hold any more for low - luminosity grbs .",
    "we also find that these bursts are consistent with the @xmath285@xmath286 correlation @xcite and four of them also with the @xmath285@xmath4 correlation @xcite .",
    "unlike the results obtained by @xcite , we do not find evidence for a tighter correlation using @xmath17 instead of @xmath3 .",
    "rather , fewer grbs appear to have a significant measure of @xmath17 ; we ascribe this to the fact that the smoothing filter adopted by @xcite to construct the reference light curve with respect to which the variability is computed , only selects high - frequency variability .",
