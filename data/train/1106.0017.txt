    "total colouring has attracted a considerable amount of attention since the infamous total colouring conjecture ( tcc ) was proposed by behzad  @xcite and also by vizing  @xcite .",
    "the tcc asks whether every graph with maximum degree @xmath5 admits a @xmath6total colouring , namely an assignment of one of @xmath6 colours to each vertex and to each edge of the graph so that there is no monochromatic pair of adjacent vertices , pair of adjacent edges , or pair of incident vertex and edge .",
    "we study the circular version of total colouring in this paper .",
    "since a total colouring of a graph @xmath7 is in turn a vertex colouring of the total graph of @xmath7 , all basic properties of circular colourings carry over to circular total colouring .",
    "circular total colourings have been studied in only a few articles so far , for example  @xcite . for an introduction to circular colouring , as well as a survey of results we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the set @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the circular total chromatic number of the graph @xmath7 .",
    "it is an easy observation to see that @xmath10 . in terms of",
    "other known values of @xmath9 , they are computed precisely for all graphs with maximum degree at most  @xmath11 , as well as graphs of order at most @xmath12 , complete graphs , complete bipartite graphs , and some subcubic cases .",
    "in particular it is proved in  @xcite that the mbius ladders @xmath13 have circular total chromatic number at most @xmath14 when @xmath15 , and that the prism @xmath16 has circular total chromatic number at most @xmath17 .",
    "we verified by the aid of a computer program that indeed @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .    in  @xcite an infinite family of graphs with circular total chromatic number at most @xmath17 and a graph with circular total chromatic number at most @xmath21",
    "are given . while it follows from the results of  @xcite that the set of circular total chromatic numbers of graphs with maximum degree  @xmath11 is precisely the set @xmath22 the only non - integer numbers @xmath23 realized as the circular total chromatic number of some graph are @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see  @xcite and the above discussion ) . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath26 , it is not known yet whether the set @xmath27 is infinite .    in this work",
    "we prove that every integer @xmath0 is an accumulation point of  @xmath28 and hence of @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath30 is infinite when @xmath31 .",
    "this work was partly motivated by the following conjecture of xuding zhu for circular edge colouring :    @xcite integers @xmath0 are the only accumulation points of the set @xmath32 .",
    "[ conj : zhu ]    we conjecture that the same holds for circular total colouring .",
    "for convenience , we allow half - edges in graphs . a half - edge has only one end vertex .",
    "we may join two half - edges to form an edge joining their end vertices .",
    "we use the notion of @xmath33colourings for our upper bounds .",
    "a @xmath33colouring of a graph @xmath7 is any function @xmath34 such that for any pair @xmath35 of adjacent vertices we have @xmath36 .",
    "a @xmath33total colouring of a graph is a @xmath33colouring of its total graph .",
    "the circular total chromatic number of a graph @xmath7 is defined by @xmath37 therefore existence of a @xmath33total colouring for @xmath7 implies @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph @xmath40 by deleting one vertex , but leaving its incident edges in as half - edges .",
    "the following lemma is the main ingredient in our construction .",
    "the graph @xmath39 is type  @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , in every @xmath42total colouring of @xmath39 , all the half - edges receive the same colour .",

    "we define a @xmath42total colouring @xmath54 of @xmath39 as follows : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the fact that @xmath54 is a proper total colouring of @xmath39 follows immediately since @xmath58 is a latin square .    for the second part of the lemma , let @xmath54 be a @xmath42total colouring of @xmath39 with the colours @xmath59 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath60 , thus @xmath61 for all  @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , since each @xmath62 has @xmath52 incident edges , all colours must appear either on @xmath62 itself or on an edge incident with it .",
    "in particular each @xmath62 is incident with an edge coloured  @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the set of edges coloured @xmath41 is a matching which saturates @xmath63 , hence it also saturates @xmath64 .",
    "this means that @xmath65 is the only vertex coloured  @xmath41 .",
    "subsequently the vertices in @xmath66 must all receive different colours , say @xmath67 for @xmath49 , which leaves only the colour  @xmath68 for the vertices @xmath62 .",
    "that is @xmath69 for all  @xmath48 .",

    "note that in such colouring each occurrence of the colour @xmath68 may be replaced by @xmath92 and the colouring remains proper .",
