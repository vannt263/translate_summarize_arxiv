    "planetesimals are solid objects that are assumed to exist in protoplanetary disks .",
    "it is thought that they had sizes larger than a kilometer in the solar nebular , which is large enough for gas drag forces to be insignificant compared to gravitational scattering .",
    "the terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants are considered to have been formed by the collisional accretion of planetesimals .",
    "however , the planetesimal formation process in protoplanetary disks remains controversial .",
    "small dust grains ranging in radii from a few microns to a few centimeters , grow by collisional sticking ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the sticking force between dust aggregates having radii of larger than one centimeter is so weak that the growth of such aggregates may stall .",
    "dust collisions lead to fragmentation of dust aggregates because of the large collision velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , meter - sized dust aggregates are strongly affected by gas drag and drift radially on account of the headwind from the slower rotating gas .",
    "the timescale of the drift is approximately @xmath0 at 1 au @xcite .",
    "if the gas flow is laminar , the dust aggregates settle toward the mid - plane , and the dust layer becomes very thin .",

    "dust aggregates sediment to its center and a planetesimal forms @xcite .",
    "the planetesimal formation timescale in the clump is longer than the dynamical timescale , but its size is expected to be the same as the classical estimate @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gravitational instability model has been considered as a promising mechanism of planetesimal formation .    however ,",
    "if the gas is turbulent , the dust aggregates are stirred up and the dust layer is not gravitationally unstable .",
    "various mechanisms for driving turbulence have been proposed , including magneto - rotational instability @xcite and shear instability @xcite .",
    "the resulting turbulence prevents the dust layer from settling , and the gi may not occur .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is the streaming instability model @xcite . when dust particles are moderately coupled to gas , they clump strongly enough to undergo gravitational collapse due to the streaming instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that large planetesimals , i.e. , ceres - sized planetesimals , can form directly by the streaming instability and subsequent gi .",
    "planetesimal formation by the streaming instability requires dust aggregates in the protoplanetary disk to become decimeter - sized particles .",
    "however , the mechanism by which dust particles can grow to decimeter - size is unknown .",
    "if dust particles are small and the drag force is strong , streaming turbulence develops @xcite .",

    "using the turbulence model , he obtained the threshold metallicity @xmath6 .",
    "if dust particles can not grow large , the secular gi may be more important than the streaming instability .",
    "we have investigated the particle density evolution in turbulence and have derived a similar result independently of @xcite . in the present study , we restrict our investigation to small dust particles with a very strong drag force . although the results of @xcite are more general than the results of the present study , we derive time evolution equations for small dust particles in the turbulence in a more rigorous manner .",

    "the equations of motion for dust particles are @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the external force that depends on the particle position @xmath10 , and @xmath18 is the turbulence velocity .",

    "the gas velocities are stochastic variables , and equations ( [ eq : eomx ] ) and ( [ eq : eomy ] ) are stochastic differential equations and are referred to as langevin equation in statistical physics .",
    "we assume that the stopping time due to gas drag is shorter than the kepler time and the timescale over which the turbulence velocity changes .",

    "the terminal velocity is given by the force balance : @xmath20 @xmath21      we assume that the ensemble mean of turbulent gas velocity is the keplerian velocity .",

    "we assume that @xmath54 is smaller than the typical timescale @xmath55 but is larger than the eddy turnover time @xmath56 .",
    "these velocities are equal to the terminal velocity of dust without turbulent stirring .",

    "the radial diffusion coefficient @xmath43 is the same as the diffusion coefficient in @xcite .",
    "if gas drag is strong , then dust particles are well coupled with the gas and the diffusion coefficient for the dust is the same as that for the gas @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we can use this approximation for small dust particles that are much smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "when we consider the external force as the self - gravity of the dust layer , the external forces of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 components are @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the gravitational potential is given by the poisson equation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the dust density .",
    "the time evolution equation derived here is the time evolution equation for the special case in @xcite , in which the hydrodynamic equation was considered and an additional diffusion term was added to the equation of continuity . since the gas drag is assumed to be strong , the coriolis force is negligible .",
    "the time evolution equations in @xcite without the coriolis force are @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath73 is the gas diffusion coefficient .",
    "if the gas drag force is strong , then the mass flux is estimated in terms of the terminal velocity : @xmath74 substituting equation ( [ eq : term ] ) into equation ( [ eq : eoc_youdin ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the effective diffusion coefficient : @xmath77 the model of the velocity dispersion and the diffusion coefficient in @xcite is as follows : @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the gas diffusion coefficient .",
    "for the strong gas drag limit , the velocity dispersion and the diffusion coefficient are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "when the gas drag is strong , by solving the equation of motion , the velocity is approximated by the terminal velocity with the pressure gradient . since the pressure gradient term is small compared to the diffusion term in the strong drag limit , the terminal velocity is equal to that in the present paper .",
    "the basic equation of the present paper is derived from the strict stochastic model .",
    "thus , the formulation in @xcite is valid at least if the gas drag is strong .",
    "if the gas drag is weak , the formulation of the present paper , i.e. , the advection - diffusion equation , breaks down .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic equation with a diffusion term for the weak drag limit has not yet been verified .",
    "when the gas drag is weak , the relaxation of the velocity distribution is very slow . in this case",
    ", the hydrodynamic picture may break down .",
    "the time evolution equation for the weak drag limit is arguable .",

    "this feature is similar to the secular gi for the hydrodynamic equation model @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation indicates that the unstable mode always exists , regardless of the diffusion term .",
    "the turbulent diffusion makes the growth rate small , but it can not stabilize all modes . the diffusion term is effective for the short wavelength mode .",
    "however , the long wavelength mode is still unstable , even though the turbulent diffusion is included .",
    "the maximum growth rate is @xmath99 and the wave number of the maximum growth rate is @xmath100 the maximum growth rate is a decreasing function of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this maximum growth rate and the wave number are identical to equation ( 56 ) in @xcite with @xmath101 .",
    "this indicates that the analysis of @xcite is valid when @xmath85 .",
    "the physical meaning of the secular gi can be understood in terms of the responses to the density perturbation .",
    "this is the diffusive support secular gi explained in section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "the responses of the potential and the velocity to the density perturbation are shown in figure [ fig : eigen ] .",
    "we assume a sinusoidal density fluctuation .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath102 is induced by the density fluctuation . due to the resultant potential gradient",
    ", the matter moves to the local maximum point of the surface density at terminal velocity .",
    "therefore , the density fluctuation increases monotonically .",
    "the timescale of the secular gi and the stabilization by the diffusion can be understood as follows .",
    "first , we neglect the effect of the diffusion .",
    "we suppose a wave with wavelength @xmath103 .",
    "the specific force at a point located at distance @xmath103 from an infinite straight line with line density @xmath104 is @xmath105 .",
    "we approximate the gravitational field from the wave as the gravitational field from an infinite straight line with line density @xmath106 . from the force balance between the gravitational force and the drag force ,",
    "the terminal velocity is given as @xmath107 .",
    "the resulting mass flux is @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the timescale of the increase in the surface density is @xmath109 .",
    "this corresponds to the growth time calculated by equation ( [ eq : drel ] ) with @xmath110 .",
    "this mode should be stabilized if the diffusion time @xmath111 is shorter than the timescale of the secular gi .",
    "thus , the critical length scale for the secular gi is @xmath112 .",
    "this estimation is consistent with the linear stability analysis .",
    "the diffusion can smooth out only small - scale density fluctuation .",
    "the long wavelength mode is not stabilized by the diffusion .      for the sake of simplicity , the dust layer is assumed to be infinitesimally thin . however , in reality , the dust particles are stirred by the turbulence , and the dust layer has a finite thickness .",
    "we account for the effect of the finite thickness of the dust layer by introducing a softening term in the poisson equation @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the thickness of the dust layer .",
    "this expression indicates that the finite thickness reduces the effect of the self - gravity by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the finite thickness dust layer is @xmath116 the critical wave number for the finite - thickness disk is smaller than that for the infinitesimally thin disk : @xmath117 the wave number for the most unstable mode @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 : @xmath120 we calculate the leading term of the power series expansion with respect to @xmath114 and obtain the asymptotic solution of equation ( [ eq : wavenum_mu ] ) . when @xmath121 , @xmath122 is approximated as @xmath123 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the infinitesimally thin approximation .",
    "when @xmath124 , @xmath122 is approximated as @xmath125 .",

    "we can prove that the real positive solution @xmath127 must be smaller than @xmath128 for any @xmath114 .",
    "the effect of the finite thickness is to elongate the most unstable wavelength .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ wavenum_mukmax ] shows the maximum growth rate of the secular gi @xmath129 as a function of the dust layer thickness @xmath114 . when the dust layer is thick , the effect of the reduction in the self - gravity due to the dust thickness is significant .",
    "thus , the maximum growth rate is a decreasing function of the dust layer thickness .",
    "if the dust layer is much thinner than the critical wavelength @xmath130 , the effect of the thickness is negligible .",
    "therefore , the thickness factor @xmath131 determines the effect of dust layer thickness .",
    "we have neglected the effect of back - reaction of the dust on the gas .",
    "if we consider the back - reaction , the turbulence velocity may change with the dust surface density . according to a numerical simulation by @xcite ,",
    "the particle random velocity in the dense region is small , and the resulting diffusion coefficient in the dense region is small .",
    "thus , the diffusion coefficient @xmath73 may be a decreasing function of the surface density @xmath132 .",
    "in general , @xmath73 is a function of @xmath132 . here",
    ", we investigate the density - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath133 .",

    "the diffusion term in the advection - diffusion equation is @xmath136 in other words , the term obtained from @xmath137 is added to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "thus , when we consider the density - dependent diffusion coefficient , we must replace the diffusion coefficient in equation ( [ eq : drel ] ) by @xmath138 therefore , we obtain @xmath139 where @xmath140 if we adopt the power - law model , we obtain @xmath141 .    when @xmath142 , any mode is unstable , although self - gravity is not considered . essentially , this is the same as the diffusion instability ( viscous instability ) that was discussed in explaining the ring structure of saturn @xcite . if @xmath142 , @xmath143 is a local minimum value when the density is a local maximum value .",
    "thus , the density at the local maximum point of the surface density increases due to the resultant diffusion flux .",
    "when @xmath144 , the diffusion term vanishes . in this case ,",
    "due to self - gravity , any mode is unstable .",
    "when @xmath145 , the diffusion term stabilizes the short wavelength modes .",
    "thus , the maximum growth rate exists . the maximum growth rate and the wave number",

    "in the present paper , we focus on the shear turbulence in the application . the diffusion coefficient due to shear turbulence",
    "does not depend on @xmath132 .",
    "thus , in the following , we will not discuss the secular gi for the density - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that this effect can be important in some types of turbulence .",
    "in particular , when @xmath149 , the maximum growth rate depends sensitively on @xmath148 .",
    "the linear stability analysis reveals that a small density fluctuation can grow in a turbulent disk regardless of the turbulence strength .",

    "he applied @xmath230 to the turbulence model @xmath231 and calculated the metallicity thresholds . in this section , we perform essentially the same analysis .",

    "the ratio @xmath182 is positive and smaller than unity .",

    "therefore , if the protoplanetary disk is more massive than the minimum - mass disk , the secular gi can be effective at 1 au , although the dust - to - gas mass ratio is the standard value .",

    ", the epstein drag model is appropriate because the mean free path of the gas is longer than the dust particle radius .",
    "the timescale of the secular gi does not depend on the distance from the sun @xmath152 .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath260 corresponds to the snow line .",
    "since the surface density of dust is large outside the snow line , the secular gi is rapid .",
    "since the drag force from gas is weaker for larger dust particles , the timescale of the secular gi is faster for larger dust particles .",

    "the epstein drag law is appropriate at @xmath272 for @xmath273 since we assume small dust particles , such as 1 @xmath274 , this condition is satisfied . therefore , the maximum growth time of the secular gi in the protoplanetary disk is evaluated in terms of epstein drag .",
    "the condition whereby the secular gi grows within the disk life time @xmath275 is given as follows : @xmath276 when @xmath277 , the critical radius in order for the secular gi to grow within @xmath278 is @xmath279 .",
    "we investigated the secular gi for the case in which dust particles are very small .",
    "a general analysis of the secular gi has been performed by @xcite .",
    "he used the hydrodynamic equation with the additional diffusion term .",
    "his result may be applicable for even large dust particles .",
    "however , his formulation is somewhat intuitive . we herein restrict ourselves to small dust particles and investigate the same instability rigorously .",
    "we obtained essentially the same result , although the present study was conducted independently of @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the general turbulence , whereas we focused on the specific shear turbulence model reported by @xcite and discuss the condition for the secular gi in detail .    in the case of small particles ,",
    "the stopping time is shorter than the turbulence auto - correlation time , @xmath85 .",
    "we can neglect the particle inertia because the gas drag relaxation is very rapid .",
    "we derived an advection - diffusion equation for small particles in turbulence from the langevin equation considering the external force field .",
    "we confirmed that the radial diffusion coefficient derived in the present paper is the same as that derived in @xcite .",
    "considering the self - gravity of the particles with a thin disk approximation , we performed linear stability analysis of the advection - diffusion equation .",
    "we calculated the growth rate of the secular gi .",
    "although the diffusion can stabilize the short wavelength mode , the long wavelength mode is always unstable , even though the turbulence is strong .",
    "next , we considered the effect of the finite thickness of the dust layer .",
    "the thickness of the dust layer weakens the secular gi because of the lower density of a dust layer of finite thickness . if the diffusion coefficient depends on the surface density , the growth rate changes .",
    "in particular , if the diffusion coefficient decreases with the surface density , the growth rate of the secular gi can become very large .    assuming the minimum - mass disk model , we calculated the growth rate of the secular gi .",
    "we adopted the constant richardson number density distribution model as the dust layer model @xcite .",
    "we calculated the turbulent diffusion coefficient from the density distribution assuming the mass flux balance and confirmed that the thin disk approximation is valid when the critical wavelength is smaller than the thickness of the dust layer .",
    "if the dust - to - gas mass ratio is large or the temperature at the mid - plane is lower , the secular gi is faster than the radial drift due to the gas drag . in the case of the minimum - mass disk model , the radial drift is faster than the secular gi .",
    "the realistic surface density can be larger than that of the minimum - mass disk model .",
    "if the surface density is more than three times as large as that in the minimum - mass disk model , then the secular gi is faster than the radial drift . in this case",
    ", the secular gi with millimeter - sized dust can develop within @xmath280 years .",
    "note that the growth time is of the @xmath281-folding time scale , which is the time in which the perturbation quantities increase by a factor of @xmath281 .",
    "generally speaking , the planetesimal formation time should be larger than the growth time of the secular instability .",
    "the realistic planetesimal formation time depends on the amplitude of the initial perturbation and the nonlinear process that occurs after the linear growth .",
    "further investigation is necessary in order to clarify planetesimal formation by secular gi .",
    "we restricted the present study to the strong drag case @xmath85 and confirmed that the analysis of @xcite is valid when @xmath85 .",
    "his analysis may be applicable to more general parameters , such as @xmath282 .",
    "strictly speaking , we should solve the time evolution equation of the velocity distribution in this parameter regime , because , in general , the relaxation process of the velocity distribution is not negligible .",
    "in addition , viscosity may not be negligible",
    ". the hydrodynamic equation with a turbulent diffusion term used by @xcite should be more rigorously justified .",
    "we will investigate the time evolution equation and the secular gi for more general cases in a future study .    in the linear stability analysis , we assumed the axisymmetric modes .",
    "in general , non - axisymmetric modes can be excited .",
    "in fact , non - axisymmetric density patterns were observed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "these structures were interpreted as being similar to self - gravitating wakes induced by gi and kepler shear @xcite .",
    "when we consider the gas - free model @xcite or when the gas drag force is weak @xcite , the timescale of the gi is on the order of kepler time .",
    "the timescale of the secular gi under strong gas drag and turbulent diffusion is much longer than kepler time .",
    "thus , the kepler shear becomes significant relative to the gi .",
    "the shear makes a non - axisymmetric mode a tight trailing mode , which may eventually be smoothed by the turbulent diffusion .",
    "thus , the non - axisymmetric mode may not be able to grow sufficiently .",
    "the axisymmetric mode is expected to grow in the secular timescale .",
    "axisymmetric high - density rings form due to the secular gi . as the secular gi develops , the dust - to - gas mass ratio increases , and the dust density at the mid - plane increases .",
    "finally , the dust density at the mid - plane exceeds the roche density when the dust - to - gas mass ratio becomes larger than @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "when the dust surface density in the ring increases by a factor of @xmath284 , the ring width decreases , as follows : @xmath285 where @xmath286 .",
    "on the other hand , the critical wavelength of the dynamical gi of the thin rotating disk is @xmath287 the condition for @xmath288 is written as @xmath289 as shown in figure [ fig : r_fgcrit ] , the critical @xmath154 value for @xmath248 at 1 au is approximately 2 .",
    "then , the critical wavelength of the dynamical gi is slightly smaller than the shrunken width of the axisymmetric dense ring",
    ". we may be able to apply the dynamical gi theory of the rotating disk . in this case , the planetesimal mass and radius are estimated by the classical gi theory : @xmath290 @xmath291 the planetesimal size is larger than the classical planetesimal because the dust surface density is large .",
    "in general , the factor @xmath284 may be larger than approximately @xmath292 and the initial value of @xmath153 may be larger than @xmath293 . then , the classical gi theory of the thin rotating disk breaks down because of @xmath294 . in this case ,",
    "stability analysis of a thin ring or filament of dust with turbulent stirring is necessary in order to estimate the planetesimal size .",
    "we intend to examine the stability of a thin filament of dust with turbulent stirring in a future study .",
