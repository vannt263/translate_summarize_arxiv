    "<S> ' '' ''    ' '' ''    understanding how big all of space is and our place within its immensity , has long been one of the great mysteries for human beings to ponder . within simple cosmological models , </S>",
    "<S> consistent with general relativity , the total volume depends on the curvature of the spatial sections , while the volume of the universe which is accessible to observation is determined by the expansion history of the universe . since we now have good empirical knowledge of both global curvature and cosmological dynamics , we can constrain the fraction of the universe comprised by our observable ` patch ' .    although introductory cosmology courses teach the principles of non - euclidean spaces </S>",
    "<S> , we now know that our universe is very close to having flat spatial geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the newest results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ , @xcite ) measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) combined with other cosmological data show that the average density of the universe is within a few percent of the value required for flatness .    </S>",
    "<S> sometimes it is assumed that the universe _ is _ spatially flat . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is an empirical question , and right now we do not know whether the universe is slightly closed or slightly open . </S>",
    "<S> a closed universe , appealing on theoretical grounds ( see @xcite and references therein ) , would have finite volume , while an open or exactly flat space would have infinite volume . because of this , we do not know whether our own observable part is a negligible or significant fraction of the whole volume , although as we discuss below , it is now possible to place a rather robust limit on this fraction .    </S>",
    "<S> tegmark has used the claim that the universe is known to have infinite volume to argue @xcite that there are as many ` observable universe ' patches as there are ` multiverses ' in the quantum mechanical ` many - worlds ' picture , and hence we are already forced to imagine @xmath0 copies of ` the universe ' , perhaps more than the number of different possible particle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> hence the suggestion is that modern cosmological observations lead one to imagine that there are many near - copies of our patch out there in the vastness of the entire universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will see below , the empirically - motivated limit is more like 10 than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is no reason , purely on the grounds of cosmological observations , to be forced to believe in other versions of oneself , differing by only a few bits of information .    of course , we have no possibility for observationally determining the character of the universe on scales larger than the ( apparent ) particle horizon  that is , we can not see farther away ( using photons at least ) than the last scattering surface , where the cmb radiation was released . nevertheless , we _ can _ determine that the observable volume is very close to homogeneous and isotropic , and , by applying the cosmological principle , conclude that the universe continues to be well approximated by a homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker ( rw ) metric on scales much larger still . as we stated above , such a spacetime can be spatially open and infinite , in which case the arguments of tegmark may be relevant , or it can be spatially closed and finite . in this latter case , </S>",
    "<S> our observable volume is a finite fraction of the total volume , and those arguments are invalid .    </S>",
    "<S> if the universe is closed , current cosmological observations put an upper limit on the spatial curvature , and hence can be used to place a lower limit on the radius of curvature of such a model . by using an observational probability distribution for curvature ( together with other relevant cosmological parameters ) , and treating the universe globally as an rw spacetime , it becomes a straightforward problem to determine the minimum ratio of the total volume to the observable volume consistent with observations , i.e. the minimum number of observable - universe - sized ` patches ' that must exist .    </S>",
    "<S> based on growing circumstantial evidence , together with strong theoretical motivation , there is good reason to believe that a period of inflation in the early universe drove the spatial curvature very close to zero . however , we take the approach here of determining what can be said about the curvature based on _ empirical _ evidence alone , coupled with the minimal extra ingredient of the assumption of global homogeneity and isotropy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we will see that inflation itself _ predicts _ that we will never be able to determine the spatial curvature precisely . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , non - trivial topologies can render a spatially flat universe finite in volume , but that possibility only strengthens our contention that we can not conclude that the universe is spatially infinite . </S>",
    "<S> current limits on the topology size are in fact a little larger than the particle horizon distance @xcite .    the metric for a spatially closed rw cosmology can be written ds^2 </S>",
    "<S> = a^2()(-d^2 + d^2 + ^2d^2 ) , [ metric ] where @xmath2 is the conformal time , @xmath3 is the solid angle element , @xmath4 is the comoving radial coordinate which runs from zero at our location to @xmath5 at the opposite ` pole ' of a homogeneous closed spatial slice , and we have set @xmath6 . in this particular form of the metric , </S>",
    "<S> the scale factor @xmath7 is not arbitrary , but in fact equals the physical radius of the spatial slices . </S>",
    "<S> this conformal form makes it trivial to calculate the comoving distance to the particle horizon , i.e. the greatest value @xmath8 within our past light cone . </S>",
    "<S> the result is _ </S>",
    "<S> ph = _ 0^_0d= _ 0^a_0 = ( -_k)^1/2 d(_m , _ , _ ) , [ parthor ] where the subscript @xmath9 indicates a current value . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the present - day energy densities in matter , radiation , and cosmological constant , respectively , as fractions of the critical density today , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath14 measures the contribution of curvature to the dynamics ( @xmath15 by the energy constraint equation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the integral @xmath16 is given by d(_m , _ , _ ) = _ 0 ^ 1 ( _ + _ m a + _ ka^2 + _ a^4)^-1/2 da . </S>",
    "<S> [ ddef ]    the volume of the current spatial slice out to distance @xmath8 is v_ph = d^3x = a_0 ^ 3 , where @xmath17 is the determinant of the spatial part of the metric ( [ metric ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in particular the volume of the entire slice is @xmath18 , and so the number of particle horizon volumes that can fit in the entire slice is n_u = . </S>",
    "<S> [ nudef ]    the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are now well - measured @xcite and they fix @xmath14 through the energy constraint equation , assuming einstein gravity . choosing the best - fit wmap 3 year data set parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , we find , performing the integral ( [ ddef ] ) , that @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this tells us that the apparent particle horizon exceeds the current hubble radius by the factor @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this calculation , through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ddef ] ) , depends on the assumption of radiation domination into the arbitrary past . </S>",
    "<S> of course standard inflationary models violate this assumption , and the particle horizon can actually diverge in these models . </S>",
    "<S> but we are interested here in the _ apparent _ particle horizon , i.e.  the comoving distance to the last scattering surface , as this determines the size of the _ observable _ universe .    we can estimate the limit on the number of observable universe patches by looking at the observed probability distributions for the cosmological parameters , and through eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ parthor ] ) and ( [ nudef ] ) , convert these to a distribution for @xmath24 . since , of the relevant parameters , @xmath14 has the greatest relative uncertainty , the uncertainty in @xmath24 will be dominated by that of @xmath14 through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ parthor ] ) . using the markov chain monte carlos provided by the </S>",
    "<S> _ wmap _ </S>",
    "<S> team for non - flat cosmologies ( together with additional information on the hubble constant from the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) key project @xcite ) we calculated the likelihood function for @xmath24 ; the result is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ limitfig ] . based on this distribution </S>",
    "<S> we find a @xmath25% confidence lower limit of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath25% of models consistent with the _ wmap _ and _ hst _ data are closed models with more than @xmath27 observable - universe - sized patches , or are open models . </S>",
    "<S> different choices of cosmological data , model spaces , and bayesian priors yield somewhat different distributions for @xmath24 , but all reasonable choices yield a lower limit of @xmath28 .     based on _ wmap _ + _ hst _ data . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25% confidence lower limit is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> although by eye this distribution appears to favour values near @xmath29 , this is actually not the case due to the logarithmic scale and because of a large peak at infinite @xmath24 corresponding to open models.,width=302 ]    ultimately we are limited by cosmic variance in our observable patch . </S>",
    "<S> due to the spectrum of perturbations produced by standard inflationary models , the curvature perturbation on the scale of our patch today is of order @xmath30 ( see also for example @xcite ) , and hence we are unlikely to ever know with confidence that @xmath31 ( since we could live a few @xmath32 into the tail of the distribution ) . in that case </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nudef ] ) becomes n_u 0.1(-_k)^-3/2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the _ best _ lower limit that we will ever be able to place is @xmath33 , unless of course improved measurements find that the universe is actually open . </S>",
    "<S> but assuming that we continue to measure that the curvature is close to flat , then cosmology alone will only enable us to infer that there are _ at least _ </S>",
    "<S> 100,000 other observable patches out there . determining that the universe is genuinely infinite will remain beyond the reach of purely empirical studies . </S>"
