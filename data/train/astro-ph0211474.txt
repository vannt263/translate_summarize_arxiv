    "the present work has roots in the early and polemic work of roberto terlevich and collaborators , in which they argued that starbursts instead of mass accretion into supermassive black holes were the source of energy of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; terlevich & melnick 1985 ; terlevich , diaz & terlevich 1990 ; cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) . by 1995",
    ", other groups would also find evidences for the presence of starbursts around seyfert nuclei ( e. g. heckman et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , or smaller mass - to - light ratios than in non - seyfert galaxies ( nelson & whittle 1996 , oliva et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "our work in this subject comprises a number of papers in which we have investigated the stellar population in the nuclear region of these galaxies using the technique of spectral synthesis , obtaining in particular robust age indicators ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "1998 ; storchi - bergmann et al . 1998 ; schmitt et al . 1999 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "we have also investigated the correlation between the age of the stellar population and with other properties , such as the infrared luminosity , galaxy morphology and environment ( cid fernandes et al . 2001a",
    "; storchi - bergmann et al . 2001 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we discuss the results of two on - going studies ( raimann et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , in which we investigate the radial variation of the stellar population properties of a sample of 35 seyfert 2 galaxies and compare them with those of a control sample of non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "the questions we want to answer are : which are the main differences between the stellar population of seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies of the same hubble type ? how far from the nucleus can we find this difference ?",
    "in storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we have proposed an evolutionary scenario in which interactions are responsible for triggering the activity and circumnuclear bursts of star formation . if this is true , would nt the more external regions of the host galaxy also be affected ?",
    "the seyfert 2 sample comprises two subsamples , which we call the northern ( n ) sample ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) and southern ( s ) sample ( storchi - bergmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the n sample comprises the 20 brightest seyfert 2 galaxies with l([oiii]@xmath1ergss@xmath2 while the s sample comprises the 20 closest seyferts 2 obeying the same luminosity criterium .    as a control sample of non - seyfert galaxies we use the spectra of 10 nearby galaxies , distributed in hubble type as follows : 3 s0 , 2 sa s , 2 sb s and 3 sc s .",
    "in addition , we will also use as a control sample the one of bica ( 1988 ) , comprising approximately 100 non - active galaxies spanning all hubble types .",
    "the data consists of long - slit optical spectra , which are described in the papers listed above , except in the case of bica ( 1988 ) sample , which uses single aperture data .",
    "extraction of one - dimensional spectra from the long - slit data were performed at typical apertures of 2@xmath02 arcsec@xmath3 , sampling regions at the galaxies of 200@xmath0200pc@xmath4 to 400@xmath0400pc@xmath4 . a sample of spectra at different distances from the nucleus for one s0 seyfert 2",
    "is compared to that of a non - seyfert s0 galaxy . in fig . 1 .",
    "the measurements consist of equivalent widths ( hereafter w s ) of six to eight absorption features characteristic of the stellar population plus continuum flux ratios ( hereafter c s ) at selected pivot points .",
    "the resulting values are illustrated in fig . 2 for one seyfert and one non - seyfert galaxy of hubble type s0 .",
    "the spectral synthesis was performed using the probabilistic formalism described in cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "we reproduce the observed w s and c s using a base of star cluster spectra with different ages and metallicities .",
    "we use 12 spectral components representing the age - metallicity plane plus a 13@xmath5 component representing a canonical agn continuum f@xmath6 .",
    "as we have pointed out in our previous works , in the optical spectral range used in our work , it is not possible to discriminate between the fc and 3myr old components for flux contributions smaller than 40 per cent at 4020 , because they have very similar continua .",
    "therefore , in the description of the synthesis results we combine the 3myr and fc components in one , the 3myr / fc component .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 for one non - seyfert and one seyfert galaxy of hubble type s0 , where we compare the contribution of different age components to the flux at @xmath74020  as a function of distance from the nucleus . for the later hubble types , the gradients observed for the sa - sc non - seyferts",
    "are similar to those observed for the non - seyfert s0 galaxies . nevertheless , the values for the contribution of the different age components to the flux at @xmath74020  differ from those of the s0 galaxy . for example",
    ", the nuclear contribution of the 10gyr component in the case of the s0 galaxies is larger than 80% , while in the sa - sc control galaxies , it is around 60% .",
    "consistently , the corresponding values for the contribution of the 1gyr component are smaller than 20% for the former and reach about 40% for the latter .",
    "but the comparison between seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies gives similar results to those illustrated in fig .",
    "3 : the contribution of the old age components is always smaller in seyfert s than in non - seyferts .",

    "the results of the synthesis are summarized in table 1 , which shows that , for the seyferts of all ( s0-sc ) hubble types , the percent contribution of the oldest 10gyr stellar component is always smaller than in the control sample .",
    "this result seems to hold up to at least 1 kpc from the nucleus and in a few cases up to 3 kpc ( in which the data with high signal - to - noise ratio could be obtained that far from the nucleus ) .",
    "another difference is in the contribution of the stellar components younger than 100myr , which are obviously larger in the seyfert than in the non - seyferts , both at the nucleus and outside .",
    "the only exception regards the sc seyferts , when we compare the results with those of bica ( 1988 ) , probably due to the larger aperture of bica s study , which may be including the contribution of recent star - formation in the disk of the galaxies .    regarding the radial variation of the contribution of the different age components , we can clearly see a gradient in the non - seyfert galaxies , which shows a decrease in the contribution of the 10gyr age component and an increase of that of the 1gyr component with distance from the nucleus ( the other components contributing with very small percentages ) . this clear gradient observed in the non - seyfert s is not to present in most seyfert galaxies .",
    "the higher incidence of recent / intermediate age stellar populations in seyfert galaxies when compared with the control sample support an agn - star formation connection .",
    "our results further suggest that , in the evolutionary scenario proposed by storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , in which interactions are responsible for triggering both star - formation and the agn activity ( which outlives the starburst ) , the triggering of star - formation is not restricted to the nuclear region but seems to extend to up to 3kpc from the nucleus .",
