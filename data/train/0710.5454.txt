    "this paper provides two improvements from the joint work with yong - geun oh @xcite . in @xcite , we have provided computations of floer cohomology of lagrangian torus fibers in toric fano manifolds , which are important examples of homological mirror symmetry , and symplectic topology of fano manifolds @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "but in @xcite , we have restricted ourselves to the case of some convex toric fano manifolds because of the technical difficulty involving the transversality of moduli space .",
    "one of the result of this paper is to show how to remove this restriction , and prove that the results of @xcite hold for all toric fano manifolds .",
    "the other result of this paper is to show that slight modification of floer cohomology using non - unitary line bundle can be successfully used to prove many lagrangian intersection properties , which was not possible in the standard definition .",
    "lagrangian floer cohomology was first defined by floer @xcite , and generalized to the monotone case by yong - geun oh @xcite . the definition in full generality , including obstruction and deformation theory has been established by the ingenious work of fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite .",
    "the main feature of floer cohomology of a lagrangian submanifold is that floer cohomology ring @xmath0 is independent of the choice of the hamiltonian isotopy @xmath1 .",
    "this provides a tool to study an intersection theory of lagrangian submanifolds , which has played an important role to study symplectic topology in the last two decades .",
    "we show examples of lagrangian submanifolds which can not be displaced from itself using hamiltonian isotopy ( non - displaceable , for short ) .",
    "the main tool is the lagrangian floer cohomology , with complex - valued two form on the symplectic manifold , which we call , the floer cohomology with non - unitary line bundle .",
    "this turns out to be more efficient than the standard definition for the intersection theoretic applications .",
    "the new non - displaceable examples include all monotone lagrangian torus fibers , which was also proved by entov and polterovich via a different method , namely the theory of symplectic quasi - states and quasi - measures @xcite .",
    "we also find some new non - monotone non - displaceable lagrangian fibers and general criterian to find one in fano manifolds .",
    "recall that in the cases of the non - displaceable examples known before via floer theoretic methods , like the clifford torus ( @xcite,@xcite ) , or @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , the proof relies on the presence of strong symmetry ( balanced ) for the cancellation of quantum contributions so that floer cohomology is isomorphic to the singular cohomology . in these new examples ,",
    "they are not balanced but the new effect enables us more freedom so that we can still cancel quantum contributions out .    to explain this effect , recall that lagrangian floer cohomology has a generalization , which came from another motivation , the homological mirror symmetry conjecture @xcite,@xcite . on this generalization ,",
    "one allows , a flat unitary line bundle on a lagrangian submanifold , or more generally , one allows a unitary line bundle on @xmath3 whose curvature equals a closed two form @xmath4 ( defined on @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is usually called a @xmath6-field .",
    "the modification we consider is a non - unitary version of them for short . as far as we know ,",
    "non - unitary case has not been considered before in these cases .",
    "this maybe is due to the fact that the floer homology with unitary bundle has been used mainly for homological mirror symmetry and in such cases one usually identifies the formal parameter in the novikov ring with a complex number .",
    "for example in @xcite , we have identified @xmath7 with a complex number @xmath8 to show the equivalence of the obstruction @xmath9 with the landau - ginzburg superpotential .    but with such identification , the non - unitary version we consider in this paper is equivalent to the standard version ( with a different symplectic form ) in good cases . also , there is a delicate point we also address in this paper that when formal parameter is identified with a complex number , the related floer cohomology ( which is called convergent version ) does not provide informations which are symplectically invariant .",
    "( in the last section , we explain the example of hirzbruch surface , where some fibers have non - vanishing convergent bott - morse floer cohomology , but still is displaceable by some hamiltonian isotopy .",
    "hence , we show by this example that @xmath10 for the convergent version of floer cohomology . )",
    "the computations in this paper , and that of @xcite,@xcite was carried out using the bott - morse version of lagrangian floer homology , or an @xmath11-homology of an @xmath12-algebra of lagrangian submanifolds defined in @xcite . it was shown in @xcite that transversal and bott - morse versions of floer cohomologies are isomorphic . to compute the bott - morse version of floer cohomology of a lagrangian submanifold",
    ", one has to classify ( pseudo)-holomorphic discs . in @xcite , we classify all the holomorphic discs with boundary on any lagrangian torus fiber , and prove the fredholm regularity of the standard complex structure for all holomorphic discs .",
    "this enabled us to compute the floer cohomology , except one technical problem , which involves the non - regularity of the standard complex structure for holomorphic spheres .",
    "hence , in @xcite , we were only able to validate our results for convex toric fano manifolds .    in this paper , we describe how to resolve this problem , using a simple argument and the machinery of @xcite by combining the use of holomorphic discs and abstract perturbations of kuranishi structures together .",
    "hence , we are able to extend the results of @xcite to all toric fano manifolds .",
    "we would like to thank l. polterovich for asking for the floer theoretic proof of his results with m. entov .",
    "we also thank for m. entov , kenji fukaya and yong - geun oh for helpful comments on the paper .",
    "we remark that the idea in this paper @xcite , has been generalized by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite .",
    "we first recall the definition of floer cohomology with @xmath6-fields following the article of fukaya @xcite ( see also,@xcite ) .",

    "this may be modified with the presence of @xmath6-field as @xmath87 the factor @xmath88 records the holonomy around the boundary of @xmath85-holomorphic discs . in the case",
    "that @xmath89 , the holonomy factor alone is not enough to make it well - defined for each homotopy class .",
    "it is well - known that the theorems in @xcite can be carried over to the situation with @xmath6-fields , since the only modification is adding an additional factor to the boundary operations , which vanishes if the homotopy class @xmath34 is that of constant discs .",
    "in particular , the following theorem also holds true with the presence of @xmath6-fields . in the case of lagrangian submanifolds that we consider in this paper ,",
    "it is weakly obstructed with the bounding cochain @xmath90 , hence we omit the bounding cochains from the statement . also , for simplicity , instead of @xmath91",

    "@xmath43 theorem g @xcite @xmath44 @xmath0 is independent of @xmath1 and it coincides with the homology of @xmath12-algebra of @xmath3 .    as in @xcite,@xcite",
    ", we will show the non - vanishing of the homology of an @xmath12-algebra ( in a non - unitary setting ) to prove the non - displaceability of lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "in this subsection , we consider slight modification using a complex valued two form @xmath13 .",
    "we consider a closed complex valued two form @xmath93 such that the curvature @xmath20 of the connection @xmath19 on @xmath94 satisfies for @xmath18 , @xmath95 instead of ( [ curv ] ) .",
    "moreover , we do not require @xmath96 to lie in the image of @xmath97 as long as there exist @xmath98 satisfying the above curvature condition for @xmath18 .",
    "( i.e. we only require integrality condition when restricted to @xmath16 , not necessarily on @xmath5 . )    in the case that @xmath99 , then @xmath96 becomes a @xmath6-field discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the contribution from @xmath13 is given as @xmath100    the new expression in ( [ curv2 ] ) also depends only on the homotopy class of @xmath34 .",
    "the part of ( [ curv2 ] ) , @xmath101 depends only on the homotopy class of @xmath34 , since @xmath102 are closed two forms which vanish on @xmath103 .",
    "the part , @xmath104 also depends only on the homotopy class of @xmath34 , due to the relation @xmath105 .",
    "we remark that in many cases , @xmath13 maybe set to be zero , since considering flat _ non - unitary _ line bundle is good enough to detect non - displaceability of some lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "also , in this paper , we will choose @xmath13 so that its support is away from the given lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "in such a case , integrality condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath13 satisfies integrality condition when restricted on @xmath3 , then , it also satisfies such a condition on @xmath106 for a hamiltonian isotopy @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the story on the definition of floer homology and their properties are almost identical to the case of @xmath6-fields .",
    "the benefit of the introducing @xmath13 and non - unitary line bundle is that , as it can be seen in ( [ curv2 ] ) , we now allow the additional contribution to be in @xmath107 , whereas the traditional approach only allows it to be in @xmath108 .",
    "( we remark that in @xcite , one of their idea is to generalize this further to an element of the novikov ring based on our observation )    extension of floer cohomology to the non - unitary line bundle does not seem to be related to the mirror symmetry directly .",
    "the reason is that in mirror symmetry , one usually identifies the formal parameter @xmath7 with a specific value , say @xmath8 , and after the identification , the above may be interpreted as introducing a new symplectic form @xmath109 ( if it is symplectic ) : @xmath110 but , in the realm of symplectic geometry , the difference of formal parameter version and convergent version can be clearly observed ( see the last section ) , hence floer cohomology with @xmath13 in the novikov ring coefficient , is different from the floer cohomology with a new symplectic form .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , floer cohomology of a lagrangian fiber has been computed in a general toric fano manifold ( with convexity assumption , which we remove later in this paper ) .",
    "the lagrangian fibers with non - vanishing floer cohomology in these cases , like the clifford torus , has strong symmetry conditions on the position of the fiber and the shape of the moment polytope that we start with , hence they were called balanced fibers . for example , in @xcite , the hirzbruch surface was shown to have no lagrangian fiber with non - vanishing floer cohomology .    with the introduction of @xmath13 , we show that such symmetry condition for the non - vanishing floer cohomology , can be weakened considerably , hence providing many more examples of non - displaceable lagrangian fibers . for example , we prove that the monotone fiber in the hirzbruch surface is non - displaceable .",
    "in fact , we prove that every monotone lagrangian fiber of toric fano manifold is non - displaceable .",
    "let us first recall the notations of toric fano manifolds from @xcite , to which we refer readers for details . for a given polytope @xmath111 , and we consider the corresponding symplectic toric manifold @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath112 for @xmath113 be the inward normal vectors of each facet of @xmath111 which define one dimensional generators of the dual fan @xmath114 . denote by @xmath115 the corresponding toric divisor . also , recall that the homotopy classes of holomorphic discs with maslov index two may be enumerated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 corresponds to each facet @xmath112 .",
    "[ bi ] there exist closed real - valued two forms @xmath118 on @xmath5 which vanish on @xmath103 such that for @xmath119 , we have @xmath120    we have shown that the maslov index is given by twice the intersection number with toric divisors(theorem 5.1 @xcite ) , and from the classification theorem(theorem 5.2 @xcite ) , each holomorphic discs of class @xmath117 ( with maslov index two ) intersects non - trivially only with @xmath115 and it does not intersect any other toric divisors . hence we may choose poincare dual closed two form @xmath118 for each @xmath115 , whose support lies in a sufficiently close neighborhood of @xmath115 .",
    "these satisfy the equations above since each maslov index two holomorphic disc is a part of a holomorphic sphere which does not intersect the corresponding toric divisor elsewhere .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "we consider the case of monotone lagrangian fibers first , and we will discuss general case in the next subsection . recall that a lagragrangian submanifold is called monotone if for any @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 for some fixed constant @xmath123 .",
    "this implies that the symplectic manifold is also monotone , in the sense that for any spherical homology class @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "[ thm : mono ] let @xmath3 be any monotone lagrangian torus fiber in any toric fano manifold @xmath5",

    "then , lagrangian fiber corresponding to the origin , satisfies this property since the symplectic areas of the holomorphic discs are all equal to @xmath128 from the area formula of @xcite .",

    "the above condition actually implies that @xmath212 from the dimension calculation , @xmath213 is expected to be @xmath214 dimensional chain ( @xmath215 ) , hence for @xmath216 , @xmath213 maybe regarded as zero .",
    "now , it remains to show that @xmath135 s are _ not _ @xmath11-coboundaries .",
    "( it may become coboundary because the dimension of @xmath217 equals @xmath218 if @xmath219 . ) but we can show that @xmath135 s are not @xmath11 coboundaries by the following simple argument .    by the leibniz rule from the @xmath12-algebra equations , we have @xmath220 if @xmath221 are @xmath11-cycles , then @xmath222 is also a @xmath11-cycle .",
    "recall that its energy zero part is @xmath223 which is given by cup product of ( or intersection product of chains ) @xmath224 and @xmath225 ( here @xmath226 is the homotopy class of constant discs ) . and if @xmath224 or @xmath225 is a @xmath11-coboundary , then @xmath222 is also a @xmath11-coboundary .    for the torus ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath135 s so that the following intersection is transversal and equal to @xmath227 hence , we may define @xmath228 so that @xmath229 therefore , we may write @xmath230 where @xmath231 , and @xmath232 and @xmath233 s are chains of positive dimensions in @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath233 s are the result of sucessive operations @xmath234 s and easy computation shows that they are of positive dimensions except ( [ pteq ] ) .",
    "we remark that in @xcite we observed that @xmath235 is a singular cohomology cycle , but not a @xmath11-cycle in general .",
    "and one needs additional chains such as @xmath233 to get @xmath11-cycle in the chain level .",
    "notice that the expression ( [ ccc ] ) is an @xmath11-cycle since we assumed that each @xmath135 s are @xmath11-cycles .",
    "we claim that the expression ( [ ccc ] ) can not be a @xmath11-coboundary since its energy zero part is @xmath235 .",
    "suppose the expression ( [ ccc ] ) equals @xmath236 for some @xmath237 s .",
    "first , note that @xmath238 is of positive dimension if @xmath239 since @xmath240 hence , to have @xmath235 as a boundary image , it should be of the form @xmath241 for some @xmath242 s , but clearly this can not become a @xmath243 , since the ( signed ) sum of the coefficients of the zero dimensional chain in @xmath241 vanishes , since @xmath130 is the standard boundary operation @xmath244 .",
    "hence , this proves that ( [ ccc ] ) is a non - trivial @xmath11-homology cycle .",
    "therefore , we conclude that all the intermediate products @xmath245 as well as all @xmath135 s are in fact also non - trivial in floer cohomology .",
    "this proves the main statement of the proposition .    to prove the converse statement ,",
    "suppose that @xmath246 t^{area}$ ] for some @xmath247 .",
    "this in fact implies that @xmath248 : if we write @xmath249,\\ ] ] then it is not hard to check that @xmath250 from above .",
    "this implies that @xmath248 .",
    "now , recall the theorem 10.1 of @xcite , which shows the equivalence of @xmath248 and the vanishing of floer cohomology . since the image of maslov index two is a multiple of fundamental cycle",
    ", the computation here is very similar to that of @xcite and the only difference is the fact that in that case , we have used the fact that @xmath251 for @xmath216 , which we do not assume here .",
    "but we can work with a spectral sequence comming from the maslov index ( @xcite , @xcite ) after taking the canonical model , then the same argument as in @xcite proves the vanishing of floer cohomology .",
    "hence the converse statement holds in our case , and this proves the proposition .",
    "we first describe the problem we have encountered in @xcite , and we explain how to resolve it .",
    "recall that for toric fano manifolds , we have classified all holomorphic discs with boundary on lagrangian torus fibers generalizing the results of @xcite . by proving the fredholm regularity of the standard complex structure @xmath155 for all the holomorphic discs , and computing symplectic areas of holomorphic discs , we have explicitly computed floer differential @xmath131 .",
    "the only problem was that although @xmath155 is fredholm regular for all holomorphic discs , it is _ not _ fredholm regular for holomorphic spheres for general toric fano manifolds .",
    "it means that for the holomorphic spheres , the actual dimensions of the moduli spaces may be bigger than the expected ( virtual ) dimensions of them due to this non - regularity .",
    "hence , the moduli space of holomorphic discs of maslov index @xmath252 may not have a good compactification since it may bubble off a holomorphic sphere , and in this case the boundary strata may have bigger dimension than the main stratum .",
    "so we have restrict ourselves to the case of , so called , convex symplectic manifolds in @xcite , which guarantees the regularity of @xmath155-holomorphic spheres .",
    "this non - regularity problem can be resolved if we make ( abstract kuranishi ) perturbations of the moduli spaces , then the perturbed moduli space is almost impossible to use for computation directly .",
    "recall that without perturbation , the image of holomorphic discs of maslov index @xmath252 did not have any non - trivial contribution . more precisely , in proposition 7.2 @xcite , we have proved that @xmath253 for @xmath216 .",
    "this is because although the moduli spaces of holomorphic discs have correct dimensions , their evaluation images with one marked point is of smaller dimension than expected , and it was regarded as zero . in this way , the floer cohomology depended only on @xmath254 .",
    "but as soon as we introduce abstract perturbations to resolve the sphere bubble issues , this argument is no longer true since the images of the virtual chains after abstract perturbations will have images of expected dimension in general .",
    "hence , their contribution may not vanish .",
    "now , the arguments in the last subsection tells us how to overcome this problem , since floer cohomology can be determined by @xmath255 only . in our case , since the moduli space of holomorphic discs of maslov index two are always well - defined without perturbation , we will use unperturbed moduli spaces for the index two case and we can make explicit computations on @xmath255 .",
    "now , we can introduce an abstract perturbation for @xmath216 if necessary .",
    "even though @xmath132 for @xmath216 is not computable , the arguments in the previous subsection can be used to determine floer cohomology completely .",
    "now it is clear that the results of @xcite holds for all toric fano manifolds from the arguments in the first part , together with the machinery of @xcite .",
    "the theorems in @xcite also holds true for all toric fano manifolds    now the interesting open question is what happens in the non - fano case .",
    "the argument itself works fine even in non - fano case , but the problem is that the moduli space of holomorphic discs of maslov index two also needs to be perturbed , since there might be a sphere bubble with non - positive chern number from the maslov index two disc .",
    "this might lead us to interesting questions regarding wall - crossings and multi - valuedness of @xmath9 as in @xcite .",
    "in the first subsection , we consider the hirzebruch surface @xmath256 which illustrates very well the subtle differences between various versions of lagrangian floer cohomology considered in this paper .",
    "later , we discuss non - monotone examples .",
    "recall that @xmath256 is obtained from @xmath257 by blowing up a fixed point of the torus action .",
    "symplectic form can be given by specifying its moment polytope , which we define as the region in @xmath258 ( see figure 1 ( a ) ) bounded by @xmath259 first , recall that there are four homotopy classes of holomorphic discs of maslov index two , @xmath117 corresponding to each normal vector @xmath112 for @xmath260 . also recall the following area formula of holomorphic discs from @xcite .",
    "( theorem 8.1 @xcite ) let @xmath111 be a polytope defining a toric fano manifold @xmath5 , which is defined as @xmath261 let @xmath262 .",
    "then the area of holomorphic disc @xmath263 of homotopy class @xmath156 whose boundary lies in the lagrangian submanifold @xmath264 is @xmath265      now , one can explicitly compute the floer cohomology of @xmath268 for any @xmath269 as follows .",
    "let @xmath270 be two generators of @xmath271 , and without considering @xmath13 , we have ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath272 @xmath273 to have non - vanishing floer cohomology , we should have @xmath274 from the proposition [ compufloer ] .",
    "since two expressions ( [ hireq1]),([hireq2 ] ) differ by the last term , one can easily see that @xmath275 now , we will discuss three versions of lagrangian floer homology separately .      as there are three terms to be canceled ,",
    "it is necessary that all the terms @xmath276 should have equal area , which implies @xmath277 .",
    "hence we need to solve the equation . @xmath278 but this equation does not have a solution for @xmath279 ( see ( [ convnonv ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the standard floer cohomologies of all lagrangian torus fibers vanish in this case .",
    "we first explain the computation in the convergent case and explain its implications afterward .",
    "we recall that in the convergent version of floer cohomology which appears in mirror symmetry , one substitute a formal parameter @xmath280 in the novikov ring with a specific complex value . in general , the operations @xmath281 is an infinite sum over all quantum contributions where infinite sum was justified by using the novikov ring coefficients . after the substitution",
    ", there is a convergence issue of the infinite sum .",
    "but with the positivity assumptions , it is only a finite sum from the dimension argument .",
    "hence in this case there is no convergence problem .    in @xcite ,",
    "the substitution @xmath282 was used to identify @xmath9 and the landau - ginzburg superpotential .",
    "hence , we will consider the case of the substitution @xmath282 .",
    "note that in the convergent version , @xmath280 is of explicit value , hence the terms with different exponents could add up .",
    "then , we set @xmath283 then , vanishing of ( [ hireq1]),([hireq2 ] ) , with ( [ fleq ] ) is equivalent to @xmath284 this equation has four solutions which are approximately ( obtained from matlab ) .",
    "@xmath285 note that none of them corresponds to the origin where @xmath286 .",
    "but , in @xcite , it was observed that all the fibers other than @xmath266 are displaceable by some hamiltonian isotopy .",
    "hence , the fibers corresponding to ( [ convnonv ] ) have non - vanishing bott - morse floer cohomology @xmath287 , but is displaceable by some hamiltonian isotopy .",
    "this implies that for the convergent version of floer cohomology , we have @xmath288    this shows that the convergent version does not have the same property as the standard version at least in the morse - bott case .",
    "this is in part because the presence of formal parameter @xmath280 was crucially used in proving various isomorphisms and the symplectic invariance property of floer cohomology . but",
    "mirror symmetry correspondence seems to be related to the convergent version of floer cohomology .",
    "now , we show that we may choose a good @xmath13 which gives rise to a non - vanishing floer cohomology for the monotone lagrangian fiber @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath289 then , we can find a solution @xmath290 with @xmath291 satisfying @xmath292 in fact , ( [ hireq1]),([hireq2 ] ) becomes ( with trivial holonomy for simplicity ) @xmath293 @xmath294 @xmath295 @xmath296    such @xmath297 s are easy to find , for example , we may take @xmath298 hence @xmath13 may be taken as a suitable constant multiple ( so that @xmath299 ) of the poincare dual of the divisor @xmath300 whose support is sufficiently close to @xmath300 . then , the resulting floer cohomology with @xmath13 is non - vanishing , hence proves the non - displaceability of this monotone fiber . in this particular example , another way to prove this is to set @xmath210 and use non - unitary flat connections to obtain the same results .",
    "the first example is the case of @xmath257 blown up at three fixed points of the torus action ( in the same way at each three points ) ( see figure 1(b ) ) .",
    "in fact , there are three non - displaceable fibers as in the figure .",
    "we may define the polytope as a region bounded by the lines @xmath301 then , we can check that the fibers corresponding to @xmath302 are non - displaceable by the theorem [ generalthm ] .",
    "let us denote the normal vectors as @xmath303 in this case counting counter clockwise starting from @xmath304 .",
    "one may notice that there are two energy levels , @xmath305 of holomorphic discs of maslov index two , and and at the energy level @xmath306 , there are three normal vectors @xmath307 with @xmath308 and at the energy level @xmath309 , there are three normal vectors @xmath310 with @xmath311 hence the non - displaceability follows from the theorem .",
    "there is a higher dimensional analogue of this example .",
    "namely for @xmath312 , one can consider the blow up at @xmath313 fixed points of the torus action .",
    "then , there will be @xmath313 non - displaceable fibers as in the above example near each blow up , whose non - displaceability can be proved analogously .",
    "as dimension goes up , it gets easier to find more examples , since there are more normal vectors to play with .",
    "another example may be obtained by blowing up @xmath314 at the two fixed points where one is located at the other end of the diagonal from the other .",
    "more precisely , one can set the moment polytope to be the cube with verticies @xmath315 , and the normal vectors corresponding to the blow ups to be @xmath316 .",
    "then , if the corresponding facets are given by @xmath317 and @xmath318 , then one gets a reflexive polytope .",
    "now , to get non - monotone examples , one moves four facets ( out of eight ) together .",
    "namely    1 .",
    "consider @xmath319 , together with @xmath320 for some small @xmath321 and four other facets remain to be the same .",
    "then , the fiber corresponding to @xmath322 is not monotone , we can see that there are four normal vectors at the energy level @xmath128 and @xmath323 each .",
    "one can show that the fiber corresponding to @xmath322 is non - displaceable , in fact by the standard floer cohomology , from the cancellation argument .",
    "2 .   consider the case of @xmath319 , @xmath324 .",
    "in this case the fiber corresponding to @xmath322 is non - displaceable , using the floer cohomology with @xmath13 since cancellation arguments work with the help of @xmath325 as in the previous example .",
