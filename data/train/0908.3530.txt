    "recent observations of the pamela@xcite , atic@xcite , ppb - bets@xcite , and fermi@xcite experiments strongly suggest the existence of a new source of positron / electron fluxes .",
    "the most interesting candidate of the new source is the dark matter with a mass in the tev range annihilating or decaying into the visible particles which result in the positrons / electrons@xcite . especially , the fermi experiment has released data on the electron / positron spectrum from 20gev up to 1tev@xcite , where the spectrum falls as @xmath0 . as reported in refs.@xcite",
    "the data can be well fitted by the dark matter which mainly annihilates / decays into a pair of light scalars each of which subsequently decays into a pair of electrons or muons .    from the theoretical point of view , it is always motivated to relate the identity of the dark matter with the new physics which is anticipated from other motivations@xcite . among them ,",
    "one of the most motivated new physics is the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) which is expected as a solution to the hierarchy problem . in the ssm ,",
    "the stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a candidate of the dark matter .",
    "the lsp interpretation with a mass in the tev range@xcite , however , implies that the masses of the other supersymmetric particles are much heavier than a tev , which diminishes the significance of the ssm as a successful solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "besides , such a heavy lsp interpretation can be falsified rather easily , once the supersymmetric particles are discovered in hundreds gev range at the coming lhc experiments .    the attempt to relate the dark matter to the supersymmetric models , however , should not be necessarily confined to the lsp dark matter scenarios .",
    "in fact , the ssm always requires other new physics , the supersymmetry breaking sector which may include a stable particle as a candidate of the dark matter .",
    "the idea of the nambu - goldstone dark matter developed in ref.@xcite is one of the realization of the dark matter in a supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "there , the dark matter is interpreted as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson in a supersymmetry breaking sector so that the mass of the dark matter is in the tev range out of the dynamics of supersymmetry breaking at tens to hundreds tev range .    in an explicit example of the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario given in ref.@xcite , we considered the model where the dark matter annihilates into a pair of the light pseudo scalars , the r - axions , via a narrow resonance , the flaton , which leads to the right amount of the dark matter . furthermore , for the r - axion mainly decaying into a pair of electrons or muons , the final state of the dark matter is the four electrons or muons , which are favored to explain the positron / electron spectrum observed by fermi experiment .",
    "the most prominent difference of the nambu - goldstone dark matter model from the other dark matter models which explain the observed positron / electron excesses is that the nambu - goldstone dark matter model is strongly interrelated to the physics of the ssm .",
    "that is , in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario , it is difficult for the supersymmetry breaking to be much higher than tens to hundreds tev .",
    "this restriction suggests that the supersymmetry breaking effects should be mediated to the ssm sector at the low energy scale , i.e. , the model requires the gauge mediation mechanism@xcite .",
    "thus , the dark matter interactions with the ssm particles are determined along with the gauge mediation effects . with the interrelation to the ssm physics",
    ", the nambu - goldstone dark matter model has a distinctive prediction on such as a gamma - ray spectrum and an antiproton flux in cosmic ray .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the cosmic ray spectra in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario based on the explicit model in ref.@xcite .",
    "as we will show , the nambu - goldstone dark matter model fits to the recently observed positron / electron excesses in both the annihilating and the decaying dark matter scenarios .",
    "furthermore , we show that the model gives a distinctive prediction on a gamma - ray spectrum for a certain parameter space , which comes from the finite annihilation / decay rates of the dark matter into a pair of gluinos .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section[sec : model ] , we summarize the explicit example of the ndgm model in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , we also derive conditions so that the dark matter density is consistent with the observed dark matter density . in section[sec : spectra ] , we show how well the model fits the observed fluxes in both the annihilating / decaying dark matter scenarios .",
    "we also demonstrate how the modes into the ssm particles affect the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "in this section , we review a model of the nambu  goldstone dark matter model@xcite which is based on a vector - like susy breaking model in ref.@xcite . in the model ,",
    "the dark matters are interpreted as pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons which result from spontaneous breaking of the approximate global symmetry in the vector - like susy breaking model .",
    "the key ingredients of the model are the light flaton which corresponds to the so - called pseudo moduli of the susy breaking model , and the r - axion which is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous r - symmetry breaking . in the followings , we overview the relevant properties of those particles .",
    "the vector - like susy breaking model is based on an @xmath1 gauge theory with four fundamental representation fields @xmath2 and six singlet fields @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . in this model ,",
    "the susy is dynamically broken when the @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s couple in the superpotential , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote coupling constants . the maximal global symmetry this model may have is @xmath9 symmetry which requires @xmath10 .",
    "the susy is broken as a result of the tension between the @xmath11-term conditions of @xmath6 s and @xmath5 s .",
    "that is , the @xmath11-term conditions of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , contradict with the quantum modified constraint @xmath14 where @xmath15 denote composite gauge singlets made from @xmath16 .",
    "below the dynamical scale @xmath17 , the model is described by the light degrees of freedom , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 ) , with a quantum modified constraint , @xmath21 here , we have assumed that the effective composite operators @xmath22 are canonically normalized .",
    "notice that the above quantum modified constraint breaks the global @xmath9 symmetry into @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "thus , when the model possesses the @xmath24 symmetry approximately , the nambu - goldstone bosons appear as the result of the quantum modified constraint .",
    "furthermore , the nambu - goldstone bosons have a long lifetime when an appropriate subgroup of @xmath25 is almost exact .",
    "( we will discuss more on the stability and the global symmetry in the next section . ) in this way , we realize a model with the nambu - goldstone dark matter with mass in the tev range out of physics of tens to hundreds tev range .    to make the discussion concrete , for a while ,",
    "let us assume that the susy breaking sector possesses an @xmath26 global symmetry and rearrange the tree - level interaction eq.([eq : sqq ] ) so that the @xmath25 symmetry is manifest ; @xmath27 in the second line , we rewrite the superpotential by using the low energy field @xmath22 .",
    "we further assume @xmath28 and assume that the model possesses the @xmath24 symmetry in the limit of @xmath29 . under these assumption ,",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons are charged under the @xmath25 symmetry and are stable .    for later convenience ,",
    "let us solve the quantum modified constraint explicitly by , @xmath30 and plug it into the effective superpotential in eq.([eq : sqq2 ] ) ; @xmath31 from this expression , we see that the susy breaking vacuum is given by , @xmath32      around the vacuum in eq.([eq : vac ] ) , the tree - level potential in the @xmath33 direction is flat , and the masses of the @xmath33 multiplets can be significantly lighter than the dynamical scale",
    ". corresponds to the spin one half component of the gravitino . ] as discussed in ref.@xcite , this is a quite favorable feature to account for the observed dark matter density .",
    "the annihilation cross section of the nambu - goldstone dark matter with a mass in the tev range is generically too small to explain the observed dark matter density ( see ref.@xcite for general discussion ) . in this model , however , the annihilation cross section is enhanced by a narrow resonance which is served by the flaton , a radial component of @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noted that , for that purpose , the r - symmetry must be broken so that the dark matters with r - charge zero annihilate through the flaton resonance with r - charge two .    in ref.@xcite , we considered the model with spontaneous r - symmetry breaking .",
    "the spontaneous r - symmetry breaking is caused by effects of higher dimensional operators of @xmath34 in the khler potential , @xmath35 where @xmath36 s denote the dimensionful parameters and the ellipsis denotes the higher dimensional terms of @xmath34 .",
    "the above khler potential provides an effective description of a quite general class of the models with spontaneous breaking of the r - symmetry breaking . especially , when the above khler potential results from radiative corrections from physics at the scale @xmath37 , the dimensionful parameters are expected to be , @xmath38 where dimensionless coefficients @xmath39 are of the order of unity ( see ref.@xcite for an explicit model with r - symmetry breaking ) . from this khler potential ,",
    "the r - symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar component of @xmath34 ; @xmath40 where we have introduced the r - symmetry breaking scale @xmath41 .",
    "now let us consider the masses of the scalar components of @xmath33 . at this vacuum ,",
    "the scalar component of @xmath34 is decomposed into the flaton @xmath42 and the r - axion @xmath43 by , @xmath44 then , the mass of the flaton is given by , @xmath45 where we have used @xmath46 and assumed eq.([eq : dim4 ] ) with @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the flaton can be in the tev range for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which is a crucial property for the flaton to make the narrow resonance appropriate for the dark matter annihilation .",
    ", @xmath39 , there is a possibility that the model involves a  light \" flaton of a mass in the tev range , although those models are incalculable . ]    the r - axion mass , on the other hand , can be much more suppressed , since it is a pseudo - goldstone boson of the spontaneous r - symmetry breaking . for example , when explicit breaking of the r - symmetry mainly comes from the constant term in the superpotential , from the messenger sector gives rise to the dominant contribution to the r - axion mass .",
    "the r - breaking mass from the higgs sector , on the other hand , is smaller than the one in eq.([eq : rmass ] ) , even if the so - called @xmath50-term does not respect the r - symmetry . ]",
    "the r - axion acquires a small mass@xcite , @xmath51 this mass is in a mev range for @xmath52tev and @xmath53ev , for example .",
    "the most interesting feature of the r - axion in the above mass range is that it mainly decays into an electron pair@xcite .",
    "therefore , the dark matter which annihilates ( or decays ) into a pair of the r - axions ends up with the final states with four electrons . in section[sec : spectra ] , we see that the four electron final states of the dark matter annihilation or decay are favorable to explain the positron / electron spectra .",
    "notice that there is a lower limit on the decay constant @xmath54 of the axion - like particles which mainly decay into pairs of electrons from the beam - dump experiments@xcite ; @xmath55 on the other hand , as we will see in section[sec : density ] , the right amount of dark matter requires @xmath56tev .",
    "thus , the r - axion decaying into a electron pair in nambu - goldstone dark matter models is consistent with the constraint from the beam - dump experiment ( see for example ref.@xcite for detailed constraints on the axion - like particles ) .",
    "one may also consider explicit r - symmetry breaking by higher dimensional terms which are suppressed by some mass scale , @xmath57 , such as a quartic term @xmath58 .",
    "symmetry instead of the continuous r - symmetry .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is not affected as long as the order of the discrete symmetry is high enough . ] with this breaking term , the r - axion mass in hundreds mev range is realized for @xmath56tev and @xmath59gev . in this case",
    ", the r - axion mainly decays into a pair of muons . in the following analyses",
    ", we consider the r - axion of a mass in both a mev range and hundreds mev range .",
    "we now consider the spectrum of other light particles , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . from the superpotential eq.([eq : weff ] ) , the fermion components of @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtain masses of @xmath62 .",
    "scalar masses , on the other hand , comes from the scalar potential , @xmath63 where we have decomposed the scalars by , @xmath64 and suppressed the index of @xmath25 .",
    "notice that the r - axion does not show up in the scalar interactions in this basis , and it only appears in the derivative couplings .    from the above potential , we find that the pseudo - nambu ",
    "goldstone mode resides not in @xmath65 but in @xmath66 and the eigenvalues of the squared mass matrix of @xmath66 are given by , @xmath67 where the rightmost expressions of @xmath68 are valid for @xmath69 .",
    "the eigen mode @xmath70 corresponds to the pseudo - nambu - gladstone boson of the approximate @xmath24 symmetry , which becomes massless in the limit of an exact @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath71 .",

    "the r - axion interactions only appear in the kinetic terms . in the current basis ,",
    "the r - axion interactions come from the kinetic terms of @xmath34 and @xmath73 , @xmath74    altogether , in the nambu  goldstone dark matter scenario ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath75 ) , the light particle sector below @xmath76tev consists of the dark matter and the flaton in the tev range , and the gravitino and the r - axion with much smaller masses , while the other components of @xmath73 and @xmath77 have masses of the order of the susy breaking scale , @xmath78 .",
    "the most relevant terms for the dark matter annihilation are , then , given by , @xmath79 where the first term comes from the scalar potential in eq.([eq : scalardm ] ) , while the second term comes from eq.([eq : kin ] ) .",
    "now let us discuss the decay of flaton which is important to estimate the dark matter annihilation via the s - channel exchange of the flaton .",
    "first , we consider the decay mode into a pair of the r - axions .",
    "the relevant interactions for the decay come form the first term in eq.([eq : int ] ) , and the decay rate into a pair of the r - axion is given by , @xmath80 where we have neglected the mass of the r - axion and taken the final state velocity to be @xmath81 .",
    "next , we consider the flaton decay into a pair of the dark matter . the relevant interaction term is given in eq.([eq : int ] ) and the resultant decay rate is given by , @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the size of the velocity of the dark matter .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath84 is well - defined even in the unphysical region , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath85 . as a result , we find that @xmath84 is suppressed compared with @xmath86 , @xmath87 where we have used @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ".    as we will see in section[sec : ssm ] , the flaton also decays into a pair of the ssm particles , which are roughly suppressed by the mass ratio squared of the ssm fields and the flaton compared with the r - axion mode .",
    "thus , to determine the dark matter density , it is good enough to consider the decay into the r - axion .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the r - axion of a mass in a mev or hundreds mev range , the r - axion in the final state eventually decays into pairs of electrons or muons .",
    "therefore , the dark matter annihilation ends up with the final state with four electrons or four muons",
    ".    put it all together , we obtain the flaton decay width at @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 , and the ellipses denotes the modes into the ssm particles ( see section[sec : ssm ] ) . in the following analysis , we approximate the above decay rate by , @xmath93 since the other modes are subdominant for @xmath94 .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the @xmath25 global symmetry out of the maximal @xmath24 is exact and the dark matter is completely stable .",
    "this symmetry has been imposed by hand to make the dark matter stable .",
    "although there is nothing wrong with this assumption , it is more attractive if the stability of the dark matter is assured by symmetries which are imposed by other reasons than the stability of the dark matter . in this section ,",
    "we show that the present model can have such an accidental symmetry by which the stability of the dark matter is achieved .",
    "once the stability is assured by an accidental symmetry , the dark matter decays only through higher dimensional interactions which do not respect the accidental symmetry .",
    "as we will see in the following sections , the lifetime of the dark matter is long enough , and furthermore , the lifetime can be in an appropriate range to explain the observed positron / electron excesses .      in the susy breaking model discussed above",

    "this means that the predicted cross section satisfies the required value only for a special value of @xmath37 and @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath195 inversely , once @xmath37 and @xmath54 take these values , the predicted dark matter density is consistent with observation for a wide range of @xmath196 . in the right panel of fig.[fig : cs ] , we compared the predicted and the required cross sections .",
    "the figure shows that the predicted cross section is consistent with the required cross section in a wide range of @xmath196 for @xmath197tev .",
    "put it altogether , the both scenarios require the dynamical scale and the decay constant around @xmath197tev . from the analysis in the previous section[sec : model ] , these leads to the susy breaking scale @xmath198tev",
    ". it should be noted , however , that there are @xmath199 ambiguities associated with the strong dynamics to relate the dynamical scale and the susy breaking scale , and hence , the susy breaking scale can be slightly different from this naive expectation .",
    "in this section , we discuss the cosmic ray spectra in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario .",
    "as we have seen , the right amount of the dark matter density is achieved by the annihilation process via the flaton resonance in the early universe .",
    "the cosmic ray spectra , on the other hand , depend on how the dark matters behave at the later time of the universe . in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario",
    ", we have two options for the behaviors at the later time .",
    "one option is the scenario with the enhanced annihilation and the other is the decaying dark matter . in the case of the annihilating dark matter , the annihilation cross section at the later universe is important .",
    "as we have seen , the unphysical flaton pole results in the breit - wigner enhancement , which greatly reduces the necessity of the astrophysical boost of the annihilation cross section . in the case of the decaying dark matter , the cosmic ray spectra can be explained regardless of the annihilation cross section , and hence , scenario works well for both the physical and unphysical pole scenarios .    in the followings , we consider both options .",
    "as we will see , both options can fit the observed positron / electron spectrum .",
    "we further discuss the distinctive prediction on the gamma - ray spectrum , which comes from the finite annihilation / decay rates into the ssm particles .",
    "we first consider the electron / positron spectra from the decay / annihilation of the nambu - goldstone dark matter with the final states consist of a pair of the r - axions which subsequently decay into pairs of electrons or muons .. ] the detailed parameter sets used for the decay / annihilation of the dark matter are given in table[tb : dm ] .",
    ".setup of the dm decay and annihilation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig.[fig : electron ] , we show the predicted positron fraction ( left ) and the electron plus positron total flux ( right ) . for the analysis on the propagation of the cosmic ray in the galaxy , we adopt",
    "the same set - up in ref.@xcite based on refs.@xcite , namely the med diffusion model@xcite and the nfw dark matter profile@xcite . as for the electron and positron background",
    ", we borrowed the estimation given in refs.@xcite , with a normalization factor @xmath200 . in the analysis of the positron fraction",
    ", we have taken into account the solar modulation effect in the current solar cycle@xcite , which affects the fraction in @xmath201gev .",
    "the figures show that the excesses observed in the pamela and fermi experiments are nicely fitted by both the annihilation / decay scenario with either four electron or four muon final states .",
    "lr     + ( a )     + ( b )     +      in the above analysis , so far , we have considered that the dark matters mainly annihilate / decay into pairs of r - axions which eventually decay into muon or electron pairs . in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario ,",
    "however , the interactions between the flaton and the ssm fields are not arbitrary but are fixed for a given gauge mediation mechanism .",
    "thus , in the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario , the ssm final states of the dark matter annihilation / decay are definitely determined for a given gauge mediation model , which gives the model a distinctive prediction on the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the decay modes of the flaton into the ssm particles are given as follows .",
    "since we are assuming the models with gauge mediation throughout the paper , the interactions between the flaton and the ssm fields are obtained along with the gauge mediation effects . for example , the effective coupling between the flaton and the gauginos is given by a yukawa interaction ; @xmath202 where @xmath203 denotes the gaugino mass and @xmath204 runs the ssm gauge groups .",
    "for example , in a class of the so - called minimal gauge mediation@xcite , we obtain , @xmath205 in generic gauge mediation models , it is expected @xmath206 with an order one coefficient @xmath207 .",
    "can be vanishing for a special value of @xmath54 ( see fig.4 in ref.@xcite ) . ]    the coupling between the flaton and the sfermions and higgs bosons are also obtained in a similar way ; @xmath208 and the model dependent coefficient @xmath209 is again given by , @xmath210 for the minimal gauge mediation model .    with these interactions , the flaton decays into a pair of the ssm particles . for instance , the decay rate into a pair of the gluinos are given by @xmath211 thus , when the gluino mass is close to that of the flaton , the branching ratio of the flaton into the gluino pairs can be sizable , which gives a non - trivial contribution to the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "in the rest of this section , we demonstrate how the ssm modes affect the cosmic gamma - ray spectrum by concentrating on the effects of the sizable gluino branching fraction and take the gluino branching ratio , @xmath212 as a free parameter , which we assume is typically below 10% . in eq.([eq : brag ] ) is replaced by @xmath213 . ]",
    "the following analysis can be extended straightforwardly to more detailed analysis on model by model basis for a given gauge mediation mechanism , although we do not peruse in this study .",
    "the gamma - ray signals come from the final state radiation ( fsr ) , inverse compton scattering ( ics ) and the fragmentations of the final states of the decay / annihilation of the dark matter .",
    "especially , in the present model , the contribution from the final states with gluinos has characteristic feature in high - energy region .",
    "( as for the fsr and ics contribution , see refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively )    in this study , we concentrate on the gamma - ray signal from the fragmentation of the gluino final states . as a demonstration",
    ", we assume that the branching ratio to the gluinos of the dark matter decay / annihilation is 5% .",
    "notice that the gamma - ray signal also depends on the decay mode of the gluino . here",
    ", we assume that the sfermions are heavier than the gauginos , and consider two cases with @xmath214 gev and @xmath215 gev , while the gluino mass is fixed to @xmath216gev . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume the case that the gluino decays into only light quark pair @xmath217 and the neutralino @xmath218 , and the neutralino @xmath218 decays into a gravitino and photon .",
    "lr     + ( a ) annihilation     + ( b ) decay     +    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , the gamma - ray fluxes are shown . to estimate the fluxes ,",
    "we have used the nfw profile and averaged the halo signal over the region @xmath219 for the annihilation case , we only include the halo component . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , we also show the fsr and ics contributions from the electron and positron which come from the dm dominant annihilation / decay mode .",
    "we estimate the ics component with the method discussed in ref.@xcite , using data of interstellar radiation field provided by the galprop collaboration@xcite , which is based on ref.@xcite .    in both cases ,",
    "the dm signals are consistent with the current experiment data , and anomalous behavior of the gamma ray is expected around the dm mass for the annihilation cases or half for decay .",
    "this behavior comes from the hard component from the neutralino @xmath218 decay .",
    "lr     + ( a ) annihilation @xmath220 gev .     + ( b ) annihilation @xmath220 gev .",
    "+     + ( c ) decay @xmath221 gev .",
    "+ ( d ) decay @xmath222 gev .",
    "+    the gluino final states also raise the antiproton signal , which is severely constrained by the pamela experiment@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : anti ] , we show the ratio of antiproton which comes from signal and the background proton . in this analysis",
    ", we used the program pythia@xcite to obtain the fragmentation function of the final states into antiprotons .",
    "the analysis of the propagation of the antiproton is again based on that used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the figure shows that the antiproton flux strongly depends on the diffusion models , and the shaded region corresponds to the dependence on the diffusion model , with upper side of the region corresponds to the diffusion model max , under side min and the line med in ref .",
    "the proton background is taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the larger antiproton fluxes in the case of  i \" reflect the higher energy fractions of the quark pairs in the decay of the gluinos .",
    "we see the contradiction between the experiments and the signals in some diffusion models even for the 5% branching ratio into the gluino final states .    as a result , we see that the antiproton flux provides very strong constraint on the model . for example , in the minimal gauge mediation , the branching fraction into the gluino final states are solely determined by the masses of the dark matter and the gluino , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath223 in eq.([eq : brag ] ) .",
    "thus , the strict constraint on the branching ratio leads to a strict constraint on the mass of the gluino which is an important parameter for the susy search at the coming lhc experiments .",
    "therefore , the nambu - goldstone dark matter scenario can be investigated with the interplay between the cosmic - ray experiments as well as the direct susy search at the lhc experiment .",
