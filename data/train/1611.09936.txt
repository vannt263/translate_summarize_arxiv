    "radiation pressure can cause the dust to drift relative to the gas , by @xmath01  km  s@xmath13 .",

    "<S> dust contributes about a third of the 870@xmath1 m continuum emission , with free - free accounting for the rest . on these scales </S>",
    "<S> , there is not a good correspondence between gas , dust , and free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> dust continuum is enhanced toward the star - forming region as compared to the co emission . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that an unexpectedly low and spatially variable gas - to - dust ratio is the result of rapid and localized dust enrichment of clouds by the massive clusters of the starburst . </S>"
