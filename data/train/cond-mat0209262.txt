    "_ @xcite observed jumps in the magnetization of superconducting rings which corresponds to changes of the vorticity larger than unity .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of superconducting disks where only changes in the value of the vorticity of unit size were observed @xcite . in some respect",
    "the observed behavior in rings is similar to vortex avalanches which were observed in superconductors with strong bulk pinning @xcite or to jumps in the magnetization when several vortices ( in the form of a chain ) enter in a superconducting film of width comparable to the coherence length @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of such jumps in a defect free superconducting ring originates from the fact that several metastable states with different vorticity @xmath0 are possible for a given magnetic field .",
    "however the existence of such multiple stable states is not a sufficient condition to explain changes in the vorticity larger than unity ( e.g. they also exist in the case of superconducting disks ) .",
    "an additional important requirement is to find the stability condition and finally the state to which the system relaxes to .",
    "this requires the study of the transition process from one state to another , i.e. it requires the analysing the time - dependent process .",
    "the stability condition was studied numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a hollow cylinder , and in a number of works ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) for superconducting disks and rings by using the static ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations . unfortunately no analytical results were presented due to the rather general character of the studied systems in the above works .",
    "recently , we studied the transition process @xcite using the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "it was shown that transitions between different metastable states in a mesoscopic superconducting ring are governed by the ratio between the time relaxation of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 ( which is inversely proportional to the josephson frequency ) and the time relaxation of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we found that if the ratio @xmath3 is sufficiently large the system will always transit from a metastable state to the ground state .",
    "this leads to an avalanche - type variation of @xmath0 when the vorticity of the metastable state differs appreciably from the vorticity of the ground state .",
    "in contrast to the case of a superconducting film , in a ring the vortex entry occurs through a single point and the vorticity increases one by one during the transition . in low - temperature superconductors like in , al , sn the ratio @xmath3 is very large for temperatures far below the critical temperature @xmath4 and hence , if such systems are driven far out of equilibrium they will always relax to the ground state .    in this work",
    "we investigate the conditions under which a state with a given vorticity becomes unstable in a finite width ring and we find how the supeconducting order parameter in the ring changes with increasing applied magnetic field .",
    "we are able to find an analytical expression for the dependence of the order parameter on applied magnetic field , and hence for the upper critical field at which superconductivity vanishes in such a sample .",
    "we provide a direct comparison between the theoretical and experimental results on aluminium rings .",
    "our theoretical calculations are based on a numerical solution of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii the theoretical formalism is presented and the two - dimensional time - dependent gl equations are solved . in section",
    "iii the experimental results are presented and compared with our theory . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions and our main results .",
    "we consider sufficient narrow rings such that we can neglect the screening effects .",
    "this is allowed when the width of the ring @xmath5 is less than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the london penetration length and @xmath8 is the thickness of the ring . in order to study the response of such a ring on the applied magnetic field we use the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations    @xmath9    where all the physical quantities ( order parameter @xmath10 , vector potential @xmath11 and electrostatical potential @xmath12 ) are measured in dimensionless units : the vector potential @xmath11 is scaled in units @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the quantum of magnetic flux ) , and the coordinates are in units of the coherence length @xmath15 . in these units",
    "the magnetic field is scaled by @xmath16 and the current density , @xmath17 , by @xmath18 .",
    "time is scaled in units of the ginzburg - landau relaxation time @xmath19 , the electrostatic potential , @xmath12 , is in units of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the normal - state conductivity ) . here",
    "the time - derivative is explicitly included which allows us to determine the moment at which the state with given vorticity @xmath0 becomes unstable .",
    "it is essential to include the electrostatic potential ( which is responsible for the appearance of the josephson time or frequency ) in order to take into account the multi - vortex jumps . in some previous studies",
    "( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath22 was assumed and as a consequence only transitions with unit vorticity jumps , i.e. @xmath23 , are possible in the ring @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath24 was chosen such that after the transition the system is in the thermodynamically equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "we assume that the width ( @xmath5 ) of the ring is less than two coherence length @xmath25 , because : i ) all experimental results presented here were performed for such type of samples ; and ii ) only in this case it is possible to obtain simple analytical expressions .",
    "for instance , the dependence of the order parameter on the applied magnetic field and the upper critical field @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 the order parameter is practically independent of the radial coordinate .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig",
    ". 1 where the dependence of the order parameter in the middle of the ring is compared with its value at the inner and outer boundary of the ring , i.e. @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the mean radii of the ring ) , for two different rings .",
    "notice that these two numerical examples corresponds already to relative thick mesoscopic rings , i.e. @xmath30 . for the field @xmath26 we are able to fit our numerical results to the expression @xmath31 for rings with @xmath27 and @xmath32 this analytical expression is within @xmath33 of the numerical results .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath26 does not depend on the radii of the ring .",
    "but the value of the vorticity of the system depends on @xmath29 .",
    "for example , for @xmath34 @xmath35 for @xmath36 at @xmath37 .     on the applied magnetic field for two different rings in the ground state .",
    "dashed curve corresponds to @xmath38 , solid curve to @xmath39 and dotted curve to @xmath40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    note that eq .",
    "( 2 ) has the same dependence on the superconducting parameters as in the case of a thin plate with thickness @xmath41 placed in a parallel magnetic field @xcite .",
    "even the numerical coefficient is quite close , i.e. for a thin plate it is equal to @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we found that the transition to the normal state of our rings at the critical field @xmath26 is of second order as is also the case for a thin plate .",
    "a possible reason for this close similarity is that for a thin plate with thickness @xmath41 the screening effects are also very small . in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite an averaged value for the order parameter was used independent of the coordinate . note",
    "that this is similar to our @xmath43 which is practically independent on the radial coordinate ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the absolute value of the order parameter ( in the middle of the ring ) is , too a high accuracy , given by the expression @xmath44 , where the vorticity @xmath0 depends on the history of the system .",
    "this result is similar to the one obtained in refs . @xcite with the exception of the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) which appears due to the closed geometry of the ring and hence leads to a nonzero @xmath0 .    .",
    "dotted curve in fig .",
    "2(c ) is the expression @xmath45 , where @xmath46 - is the displacement of the maximum of @xmath47 from the @xmath48 line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    all the above results were obtained for a ring which is in the ground state at any value of the magnetic field . however such a system can exhibit several metastable states at a given magnetic field , and consequently this may lead to hysteretic behavior when one sweeps the magnetic field up and down .",
    "furthermore , with changing field the vorticity may jump with @xmath49 .",
    "an important question which arises is the condition of stability of the state with given vorticity .",
    "this question was studied earlier for one - dimensional rings @xcite , i.e. rings with zero width .",
    "it turns out that the system transits to a state with another vorticity when the value of the gauge - invariant momentum @xmath50 reaches the critical value @xmath51 at this condition it is easy to find the value of the field for the first vortex entry @xmath52    we will now generalize the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of finite width rings with @xmath53 .",
    "first we will neglect the dependence of @xmath54 on the radial coordinate in which case the gl equations reduce to one - dimensional expressions .",
    "but in order to include the suppression of the order parameter by an external field for a finite width ring we add the term @xmath55 to the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1a ) , where @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) . using the stability analysis of the linearized ginzburg - landau equations near a specific metastable state as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the modified critical momentum @xmath56 note that now @xmath57 decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this automatically leads to a decreasing value of the jump in the vorticity @xmath58 at high magnetic field , because in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath59 where @xmath60 returns the nearest integer to the argument .    in order to check the validity of eq .",
    "( 6 ) we performed a numerical simulation of the two - dimensional ginzburg - landau equations , eqs .",
    "( 1a , b ) , for a ring with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( for these parameters the theoretical findings fit the experimental results - see section below ) . in fig .",
    "2 the magnetization , the order parameter and the gauge - invariant momentum @xmath63 are shown as function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field was cycled up and down from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the condition ( 6 ) leads to an hysteresis of @xmath47 and to a changing value of the jump in the vorticity in accordance with the change in @xmath57 .",
    "the main difference between our theoretical prediction ( 6 ) and the results of our numerical calculations appears at fields close to @xmath26 .",
    "apparently it is connected with the fact that for the considered ring the distribution of the order parameter along the width of the ring is appreciably nonuniform at @xmath66 and as a consequence the one - dimensional model breaks down ( see fig .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we also considered the same ring with a defect .",
    "the effect of the defect was modelled by introducing in the rhs of eq . (",
    "1a ) the term @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the arc - coordinate ) where @xmath69 inside the defect region with size @xmath25 and @xmath70 outside .",
    "this leads to the results shown in fig . 3 for @xmath47 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . due to the presence of the defect",
    ", @xmath57 differs from eq .",
    "( 6 ) already at low magnetic field ( @xmath73 at given `` strength '' of the defect ) and as a result only jumps with @xmath23 are possible in such a ring . in this case",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath43 also depend on the applied magnetic field with practically the same functional dependence on @xmath74 as eq .",
    "the measurements were performed on individual al superconducting rings by using ballistic hall micromagnetometry @xcite .",
    "the techniques employs small hall probes microfabricated from a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "the rings - having radii @xmath75 and width @xmath5 ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 - were placed directly on top of the microfabricated hall crosses , which had approximately the same width @xmath78 of about @xmath79 ( see micrograph in fig . 4 for a ring with an artificial defect ) .",
    "these experimental structures were prepared by multi - stage electron - beam lithography with the accuracy of alignment between the stages better than @xmath80 .",
    "the rings studied in this work were thermally evaporated and exhibited a superconducting transition at about 1.25k .",
    "the superconducting coherence length was @xmath81 .",
    "the latter was calculated from the electron mean free path @xmath82 of macroscopic al films evaporated simultaneously with the al rings .",
    "the hall response , @xmath83 , of a ballistic cross is given by the amount of magnetic flux @xmath84 through the central square area @xmath85 of the cross @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , one can view the ballistic magnetometer as an analogue of a micro - squid , which would have a square pick - up loop of size @xmath78 and superconducting rings placed in its centre .",
    "we present our experimental data in terms of the area magnetization @xmath86 which is the difference between the applied field @xmath74 and the measured field @xmath87 .",
    "previously , we have studied individual superconducting and ferromagnetic disks and found excellent agreement with the above formula @xcite . for further details about the technique",
    ", we refer to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "rings with and without an artificial defect were studied .",
    "let us consider first the ring without artificial defect . in fig .",
    "5(a ) the full magnetization loop of such a ring with parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 is shown . in fig . 6 ( solid curve )",
    "the low field part of the virgin curve is presented . from the virgin trace @xmath47",
    "we can find the magnetic field for the first vortex entry , @xmath90 , and hence we estimate @xmath91 at the given temperature ( @xmath92 ) using eq . ( 5 ) ( this value of @xmath25 is in agreement with the above experimental value @xmath93 obtained from the mean free path ) .",
    "furthermore , we know from fig .",
    "5(a ) that the vorticity changes with @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the radii of the ring is larger than @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "another important information which may be extracted from the virgin curve is that at the first vortex entry the magnetization drops considerably but it does not change sign .",
    "if we recall that at every vortex entry @xmath63 decreases on @xmath97 ( and hence the current density @xmath17 and @xmath98 dv$ ] also changes proportionally ) we can conclude that the radii of our ring should be in the range @xmath99 .",
    "this agrees with the experimental value @xmath100 .    .",
    "parameters of the rings ( width and radii ) are the same within experimental accuracy.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if we take the above value for @xmath25 and @xmath101 we obtain the maximum field of @xmath102 g. this value is slightly smaller than the value obtained from figs . 2 and 3 @xmath103 which we attribute to the large coordinate step which we used in our numerical calculations of eq .",
    "1(a , b ) .",
    "the value is also larger than the experimental value @xmath104 g. this disagreement between theory and experiment is most likely connected to the semi - quantitative applicability of the ginzburg - landau equations in the considered temperature range .",
    "the range of applicability of the ginzburg - landau equations ( even stationary ones ) for this specific superconductor is very narrow .",
    "nevertheless based on previous comparison between experiments and theory for mesoscopic superconducting disks @xcite it was found that the gl equations provided a rather good description of the superconducting state even deep inside the @xmath105 phase diagram .    figs .",
    "2(a ) and 5(a ) are qualitatively very similar .",
    "for example our theory describes : i ) the hysteresis ; ii ) the non - unity of the vorticity jumps , i.e. @xmath94 in the low magnetic field region , @xmath106 in the intermediate h - region , and @xmath107 near @xmath26 . theoretically ( experimentally ) we found 6(5 ) , 13(21 ) , 22(18 ) jumps with respectively @xmath94 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ; and iii ) the non symmetric magnetization near @xmath110 for magnetic field sweep up and down .    in the ring with",
    "approximately the same mean radii and width but containing an intentionally introduced artificial defect , jumps with @xmath23 are mostly observed ( see fig .",
    "the reason is that an artificial defect considerably decreases the critical value @xmath57 ( and hence the field @xmath90 - see dotted curve in fig .",
    "6 ) . from figs .",
    "2(c ) , 3(c ) it is clear that the maximum value @xmath111 for a ring without defect and @xmath112 for a ring with a defect .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is close to the ratio of the field of first vortex entry @xmath114 obtained from experiment ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . from fig .",
    "2(c ) it is easy to see that for a ring without a defect at @xmath115 there are only jumps with @xmath116 .",
    "but if we slightly increase @xmath63 then jumps with @xmath106 can appear in the system .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath117 is close to the border value which separates regimes with jumps in vorticity of @xmath23 and @xmath106 .",
    "from our experimental data it follows that the maximum value of @xmath57 is very close to this border .",
    "thermal fluctuations may influence the value of @xmath58 , in particular for a @xmath57 value close to this border value .",
    "this is probably the reason why in the experiment ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) occasional jumps with @xmath106 are observed which are absent in our simulation ( fig .",
    "we studied multiple flux jumps and irreversible behavior of the magnetization of thin mesoscopic al superconducting rings .",
    "we have shown experimentally and theoretically that at low magnetic fields and for rings with sufficiently large radii the vorticity may change by values larger than unity . with increasing magnetic field",
    "the order parameter gradually decreases and thus leads to a decrease of the size of the jumps in the vorticity . for rings with width less",
    "than @xmath118 analytical expressions were obtained for the dependence of the order parameter on the applied magnetic field . we have found that a state with a given vorticity becomes unstable when the value of the gauge - invariant momentum reaches a critical value @xmath57 which decreases with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this is responsible for the fact that @xmath58 decreases with increasing @xmath74 .",
    "the introduction of an artificial defect in the ring leads to a decrease of @xmath57 in comparison to the case of a ring without a defect and also results in a decrease of @xmath119 .",
