    "if this is indeed the case then the phenomenological statistical operator of hadron resonance gas @xmath3 should also provide a consistent with lgt description of qcd thermodynamics in the confined , hadronic phase @xcite . here",

    "the pressure calculated on the lattice ( see fig.(2left ) ) increases abruptly when approaching deconfinement transition from the hadronic side .",
    "if the phenomenological statistical operator @xmath6 is of physical significance then this increase could be due to resonance formation . to check the importance of resonances near deconfinement",
    "one would need to reproduce lattice results on the @xmath4dependence of @xmath33 at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "however , to quantify this dependence one needs to implement the same set of approximations in eq.(1 ) as those being used on the lattice .",

    "the lattice results were obtained in 2flavor qcd , thus there is no contribution of strange baryons in eq.(1 ) . due to the taylor expansion of @xmath33 in the lattice calculations one also needs to perform a similar approximation in eq.(1 ) . in fig.(2-left )",

    "the remarkable feature of this dependence is that @xmath44 at @xmath43 is almost constant , independent of @xmath41 .",
    "this would suggest that deconfinement is density driven and can be obtained from the condition of fixed energy density .",

    "decreasing the pion mass to its physical value and including complete set of resonances expected in ( 2 + 1)flavor qcd results in the shift of the position of the phase boundary line towards phenomenological freeze - out condition of fixed energy / particle@xmath27gev .",
    "the splitting of freeze - out and phase boundary line appears when the ratio of meson / baryon multiplicities reaches the unity .",
    "we have shown that the statistical operator of hadron resonance gas used to describe particle yields in heavy ion collisions provide satisfactory description of recent lattice results on qcd thermodynamics at finite chemical potential .",
    "in particular the basic property of this operator like e.g. factorization of temperature and chemical potential dependence is obviously confirmed by the lattice results .",
    "the ratios of the coefficients in the taylor expansion of thermodynamic pressure are also well described by the expansion of @xmath28function predicted by the hadron resonance gas .",
    "these results are independent from the particular choice of the quark mass in the lattice calculations and are also to large extent free from lattice artifacts .",
    "the phenomenological partition function was also shown to describe quantitatively the temperature and chemical potential dependence of basic thermodynamical observables bellow deconfinement .",
    "this indicates that hadron resonance gas partition function is a good approximation of qcd thermodynamics of the hadronic phase .",
