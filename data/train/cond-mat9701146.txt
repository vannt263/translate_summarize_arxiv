    "let us consider a material which under suitable conditions of pressure and temperature can exist in two distinct thermodynamic phases , a liquid and a solid .",

    "below @xmath11 the value of the thermodynamic gibbs potential of the solid phase is lower than that of the liquid phase , which is only metastable . a convenient way of studying the solidification process is to adopt a phenomenological ginzburg - landau description by introducing a suitable crystalline order parameter @xmath0 which assumes the conventional value @xmath13 in the liquid phase and @xmath14 in the solid phase .",
    "one then employs a field theoretic free energy functional of the form : @xmath15=\\epsilon\\int d^d x\\ , \\left [          \\frac{\\xi^2}{2}(\\nabla \\phi)^2+f(\\phi )          \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a function of the order parameter @xmath0 with the property of having two minima of equal depth at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the specific heat at constant pressure and the latent heat of fusion per unit volume .",
    "the local field @xmath29 acts as an external field , conjugate to the crystalline order parameter @xmath0 , favoring the solid phase for @xmath30 and the liquid phase for @xmath31 . for @xmath32",
    "the two phases coexist .",
    "as usually done for first order phase transition , metastability is taken into account by eliminating @xmath0 in favour of @xmath29 via a legendre transform .",

    "a convenient way to relate @xmath36 to the known thermodynamic parameters is to consider the entropy difference between the pure uniform solid ( @xmath18 ) and liquid ( @xmath17 ) phases at the melting temperature .",
    "this is related to the latent heat by the relation @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the entropies of the liquid phase and of the solid phase , respectively , and @xmath40 the volume of the system . by using the thermodynamic relation @xmath41 equation ( [ eq : u ] ) and the expression ( [ eq : g1 ] ) for uniform fields ,",

    "we readily obtain the critical nucleation radius @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a capillarity length , which using the expression of @xmath36 , eq.([eq : g7 ] ) , can be written as : @xmath53 finally from eqs .",

    "we see that @xmath36 is small provided the interfacial thickness is much shorter than the capillary length .",
    "in this section we shall introduce relaxational dynamics into the model .",
    "a large body of work in the area of dynamic phase transitions has been focused on the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model , because of its capability of describing a variety of problems . in equilibrium",
    "the field @xmath56 minimizes the gibbs potential @xmath46 .",

    "the time - evolution of @xmath29 is now coupled to that of @xmath0 and can not be neglected anymore .",
    "in fact , when a piece of material solidifies it expels some heat and the surrounding liquid melt warms up , causing the average temperature to increase . in turn when a region of solid melts it adsorbs some heat is adsorbed and the liquid becomes colder .    as a consequence eq .",
    "( [ eq : cap2 ] ) has to be supplemented with an equation for @xmath29 .",
    "the thermal field @xmath58 is subject to the fourier equation of diffusion of heat plus an additional source term which represents the latent heat of solidification , accompanying the appearance of the solid phase .",
    "the energy balance requires that the latent heat released at the transition equates the temperature change of the melt multiplied the specific heat , i.e : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the thermal diffusivity and the last term in the right - hand side is the amount of material which crystallises per unit time and thus proportional to the heat released during the first order transition @xcite .",

    "in the long time limit we may expect that while @xmath29 becomes homogeneous , the crystalline field @xmath0 roughly assumes only the two values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if this is the case , from the knowledge of @xmath65 and @xmath29 we can compute the fraction of volume occupied by the two phases .",
    "indeed we can write @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the fraction of volume occupied by the solid and liquid phase , respectively , and the overbar denotes spatial average . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bigu ] ) and the condition @xmath72 , we get @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the asymptotic value , while @xmath75 is the initial value being its dynamic conserved . from this it follows that if the asymptotic value of @xmath29 is zero , i.e. , the system relaxes towards a two phase coexistence , the fraction of volume occupied by each phase is determined only by the initial value of @xmath75 .",
    "we also notice that when the system starts with an undercooling @xmath76 , and order parameter @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath75 , the latent heat produced is just enough to heat the melt at the final equilibrium temperature , @xmath78 . in such a case",
    "the final volume fraction of the solid is simply @xmath79 , and attains its maximum for @xmath80 .",
    "the functional @xmath63 decreases with time as it can be shown using the equations ( [ eq : quattro ] ) and ( [ eq : cinque ] ) : @xmath81   \\nonumber\\\\                         & = & -\\int d^dx\\ , \\left [                   \\gamma_{\\phi}\\ ,                     \\left(\\frac{\\delta { \\cal f}}{\\delta \\phi({\\bbox x},t)}\\right)^2                  + d\\ ,                     \\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\delta { \\cal f}}{\\delta u({\\bbox x},t)}\\right)^2                                         \\right ] \\leq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so far we have discussed purely deterministic evolution of the order parameter and of the thermal field .",
    "noises can be added to both equations to represent the effect of short wavelength fluctuations ; in this case eq .",
    "( [ eq : glo1 ] ) does not hold .",
    "the choice of the local function @xmath16 is somehow arbitrary , as long as the general property @xmath82 are satisfied .",
    "a largely used form for @xmath16 is @xmath83 which is even and has two equal minima at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 .",

    "the field @xmath0 can take only the values @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( ising - like variables ) .",
    "the phase field model described by equations ( [ eq : quattro])-([eq : tre ] ) contains all the relevant ingredients necessary to describe the phase separation occurring in solid forming melts .",
    "however , due to the local nonlinear terms contained in the function @xmath16 the solution of the dynamical equations ( [ eq : quattro])-([eq : tre ] ) are far too difficult and are known only for some special situations . in the general case",
    "the known results follow from dimensional arguments .    to overcome this difficulty , an alternative strategy is to modify the model into a simpler one , yet maintaining the general properties .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing the local quartic term in ( [ eq : locf ] ) : @xmath88 ^ 2.\\ ] ] this kind of constraint is much softer than ( [ eq : locf ] ) since it does not act on each site , but globally over the whole volume . in the following",
    "we shall denote it as _ globally constrained model _ or _",
    "spherical model _",
    "@xcite in contrast with the model ( [ eq : quattro])-([eq : tre ] ) where the constraint is local @xcite .",
    "the price one pays for this change is the loss of sharp interfaces between two coexisting phases . as abraham and",
    "robert@xcite showed longtime ago the spherical model in zero external field displays two ordered phases below the critical temperature , but no phase separation .",
    "equivalently one can say that a planar interface between two coexisting phases is unstable , due to the presence of long - wavelength excitations analogous to spin - waves , an instability much stronger than the one due to the presence of capillary waves in the scalar order parameter case @xcite . as a consequence , while this choice is very convenient for analytic calculations , it changes the structures of the non uniform solutions in the static limit .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of this fact , the model has a rich phenomenology as we shall see below and the approach to equilibrium remains highly non trivial .",

    "we , finally , remark that perhaps , the most serious flaw of the model , is that it suffers from the same problem as the spherical model .",
    "in contrast with the local constrained phase field model , which displays a region of metastability of the liquid phase in the @xmath0-@xmath8 plane , between the coexistence line and the spinodal line @xcite , the globally constrained model is always unstable inside the two phase coexistence line . as a consequence ,",

    "<S> interestingly , we find that the system relaxes towards a mixed phase , depending on the average value of the conserved field , i.e. on the initial condition . such a phase is characterized by large fluctuations of the @xmath0 field .    in the last few years considerable effort has been devoted to the study of systems far from equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> well known examples are provided by phase separating systems , initially prepared in a state of equilibrium , and rendered unstable by modifying a control parameter such as temperature , pressure , or magnetic field . to restore stability </S>",
    "<S> they evolve towards a different equilibrium state determined by the final value of the controlling fields </S>",
    "<S> . such evolution can be very slow and is often characterized by non uniform , complex structures both in space and time .    </S>",
    "<S> two simple dynamical models , often called model a @xcite and model b @xcite , have been introduced in the literature in order to understand kinetic ordering phenomena ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model a describes the growth process , when the order parameter is non conserved , whereas the model b is appropriate if the order parameter is conserved . in the first case , </S>",
    "<S> the late stage growth is driven by the tendency of the system to minimize the energy cost due to the presence of interfaces between regions separating different phases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as the curvature decreases the process slows down and the domain size , @xmath1 , grows in time according to the law @xmath2 . in the conserved case , instead </S>",
    "<S> , the approach to equilibrium is limited by the diffusion of the the aggregating material , as larger domains can grow only at the expenses of smaller ones . </S>",
    "<S> the average size @xmath1 increases proportionally to @xmath3 , where the dynamical exponent @xmath4 is @xmath5 for scalar order parameters and @xmath6 for vector order parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> a further model , known as phase field model ( pfm ) , is somehow intermediate between a and b and consists of two fields coupled bilinearly : one field represents a non conserved ordering parameter , with type a dynamics , whereas the second is a temperature shift field subject to a diffusion equation supplemented by a source term . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be cast in the form of coupled partial differential equations for a non conserved order parameter interacting with a time dependent conserved field . </S>",
    "<S> its dynamics is very rich , since it displays features characterizing both the pure a and the pure b models as it is revealed from the analysis of the structure functions at different times . in other words , after a rapid initial evolution one observes an intermediate stage in which the growth is curvature driven and an asymptotic regime during which diffusion limited behavior is seen .    </S>",

    "<S> an example is the growth of a solid nucleus from its undercooled melt , a phenomenon encountered in rapidly solidifying materials , such as metals , where the growth is limited by the rate of transport of the heat of fusion away from the solid - liquid boundary @xcite . as the heat released by the solid accumulates at the interface , it slows down the growth , because diffusion must act over a thicker and thicker region . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has also implications in the morphology of the growing phases and is responsible for the instability of a planar solid - liquid interface with respect to a perturbation of its shape ; one realizes , immediately , that a protrusion of the solid phase into the liquid advances faster than its neighboring regions , because it explores a region where the undercooling is greater , so its growth becomes faster . </S>",
    "<S> the solid - liquid surface tension eventually provides the necessary balance and prevents the interface to be eroded by fluctuations of very short wavelength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another very closely related problem , is the the growth of the solid phase in multicomponent solutions , where one of the components is to be diffused away from the interface in order to form a stable crystal @xcite . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we shall confine the discussion to the thermal case for the sake of clarity , and investigate the kinetic ordering of a spherical version of the phase field model . </S>",
    "<S> this study , extends our previous investigations @xcite to include a non vanishing order parameter . in our opinion </S>",
    "<S> it can be useful , because it provides one the few models , whose static properties can be obtained exactly in arbitrary dimensionality and whose relaxation behavior can be analysed in great detail by means of analytical and numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the field of ordering kinetics there exist only a few models for which the relaxation can be studied without performing heavy numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the late stage behavior of processes with conserved dynamics is hardly observable numerically , due to computer limitations @xcite . besides the examples cited above </S>",
    "<S> , this study may be of some help to treat analytically some models introduced recently with the aim of describing irreversible aggregation phenomena @xcite .    in the present paper </S>",
