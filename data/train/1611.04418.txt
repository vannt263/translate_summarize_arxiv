    "<S> we develop a spin - chain model for strongly interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - fermi mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that all properties of the system can be calculated from states representing the ordering of the bosons and fermions within the atom chain and from the ground - state wave function of spinless noninteracting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we validate the model by means of an exact diagonalization of the full few - body hamiltonian in the strongly interacting regime . using the model </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the phase diagram of the atom chain as a function of the boson - boson ( bb ) and boson - fermion ( bf ) interaction strengths and calculate the densities , momentum distributions , and occupancies of the harmonic - trap levels for approximately 20 particles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) order and a demixing of the bosons and fermions in certain interaction regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , no demixing for equally strong bb and bf interactions in agreement with earlier calculations that combined the bethe ansatz with a local - density approximation . </S>"
