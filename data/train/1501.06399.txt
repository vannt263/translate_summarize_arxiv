    "it is assumed , that distribution of impurities is completely random , i.e. their positions are not correlated .",
    "effect of correlations on thermodynamic properties of superconductors is of the second order on concentration and in most cases it can be neglected in comparison with the principal mean field effect , which is linear in @xmath2 , but there may be special reasons for an enhancement of contribution of correlations .    in the last two - three decades",

    "doping with impurities is significant part of a processes of their preparation .",
    "the pairbreaking effect of impurities in high-@xmath1 superconductors is observed experimentally @xcite , but the lowering of @xmath1 in many cases is smaller than that , predicted by the ag theory ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this tendency is interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a manifestation of inhomogeneity of the condensate which can be appreciable in superconductors with a very short coherence length .",
    "doping of metallic superconductors changes not only concentration and distribution of scattering centers but also other parameters like concentration of charge carriers , lattice constant etc . , which in their turn change the @xmath1 .",

    "cooper pairs here are formed in a state with angular momentum @xmath91 and spin @xmath101 , so that the rotational symmetries both in spin and in the orbital space are broken .",
    "properties of pure ( or bulk ) superfluid @xmath0he are thoroughly investigated experimentally and most of them are quantitatively interpreted @xcite so that changes introduced by impurities can be accurately separated .",
    "all that makes liquid @xmath0he a favorable object for a study of effect of impurities , except that introduction of impurities in the superfluid @xmath0he is not a trivial task .",
    "possible floating impurities at these low temperatures stick to the walls of a container .",
