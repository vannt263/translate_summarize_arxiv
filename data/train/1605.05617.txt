    "<S> . temperature dependent measurements of x - ray diffraction , anisotropic electrical resistivity , elastoresistivity , thermoelectric power , hall effect , magnetization and specific heat , combined with field dependent measurements of electrical resistivity and field and pressure dependent measurements of magnetization indicate that cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is an ordered , stoichiometric , fe - based superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature , @xmath1  =  35.0@xmath20.2k . </S>",
    "<S> other than superconductivity , there is no indication of any other phase transition for 1.8k  @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath3  300k . </S>",
    "<S> all of these thermodynamic and transport data reveal striking similarities to that found for optimally- or slightly over - doped ( ba@xmath5k@xmath6)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 , suggesting that stoichiometric cakfe@xmath8as@xmath8 is intrinsically close to what is referred to as `` optimal - doped '' on a generalized , fe - based superconductor , phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic superconducting upper critical field , @xmath9 , of cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 was determined up to 630 koe . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy parameter @xmath10 , for @xmath11 applied perpendicular and parallel to the c - axis , decreases from @xmath12 at @xmath1 to @xmath13 at 25 k which can be explained by interplay of paramagnetic pairbreaking and orbital effects . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes of @xmath14 koe / k and @xmath15 koe / k at @xmath1 yield an electron mass anisotropy of @xmath16 and short ginzburg - landau coherence lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 can be extrapolated to @xmath20 koe , well above the bcs paramagnetic limit . </S>"
