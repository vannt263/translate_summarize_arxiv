    "w.  veech s celebrated dichotomy @xcite applies in the setting of his initial examples : gluing together two copies of a regular @xmath1-gon by identifying opposite sides by translation results in a translation surface @xmath3 having exactly two types of directions for linear flow completely periodic or uniquely ergodic .",
    "indeed , a completely periodic direction @xmath4 enjoys the stronger property that the surface decomposes into a collection of cylinders in the direction , and the moduli of these cylinders are rationally related .",
    "directly related to this , there is a parabolic @xmath5 real matrix fixing the inverse of the slope , thus @xmath6 ; veech shows that for these examples , the obvious rotational symmetry and a parabolic element generate the full ( fuchsian ) group of derivatives of the ( orientation preserving ) affine diffeomorphisms of the surface .",
    "after calta @xcite , and calta ",
    "smillie @xcite , one is strongly motivated to normalize by taking a surface in the @xmath7-orbit of @xmath3 whose planar presentation has its vertices in the trace field of @xmath8  for then also the set of slopes in which the @xmath9-invariant vanishes coincides with this field .",
    "here , we apply work of a. leutbecher and others on cusps of related fuchsian groups to easily reach the sobering implication that even surfaces of optimal dynamics have non - parabolic directions with vanishing @xmath9-invariant .    in a certain sense ,",
    "the differing planar presentations of the surfaces emphasize different number fields , with the original veech construction being directly related to @xmath10 .",
    "thus the choice of normalized surface requires understanding the relationships of various trigonometric fields .",
    "the literature reveals some minor confusion about these relationships and hence , in an appendix , we address the various possibilities for containments of number fields generated over @xmath11 by trigonometric values .      for each of veech s @xmath8 we give a @xmath7-equivalent surface normalized so that its periodic direction field  in the sense of calta and smillie ",
    "equals the trace field . with this in hand , we use number theoretic results to find explicit non - parabolic directions with vanishing saf - invariant . in particular , we show the following .",
    "[ main ] all directions of vanishing saf - invariant are parabolic on @xmath0 if and only if the trace field of @xmath0 is at most a quadratic extension of the field of rational numbers .",
    "thus , exactly for @xmath12 .    [ thmegs ] the set of indices for which the surface @xmath0 has an affine pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism whose contracting direction has vanishing saf - invariant includes @xmath13 .    [ remone ] our proof of theorem  [ main ] proceeds by first replacing @xmath0 by a natural degree two quotient , clearly identifying normalized surfaces equivalent to the these surfaces so as to apply arithmetic results of the school of a.  leutbecher on parabolic fixed points of the hecke groups .",
    "these groups are commensurable , that is conjugate up to finite index , with the veech groups of the @xmath8 .",
    "this reduces us to a finite number of unresolved cases ; for these , we construct explicit `` special '' hyperbolic matrices  and thus affine pseudo - anosov diffeomorphisms whose contracting direction has vanishing saf - invariant .",
    "these examples also complete leutbecher s project .",
    "in fact , the positive statement of theorem  [ main ] follows from results now already known : mcmullen @xcite has shown ( using equivalent terminology ) that any veech surface of quadratic trace field has the property that all its directions of vanishing saf - invariant are parabolic . that the @xmath0 of higher degree trace field no longer enjoy this property leads us to presume that no veech surface of cubic or higher trace field has only parabolic directions have vanishing saf - invariant .",
    "this is another indication that , in genus larger than 2 , the situation is much more complicated than the rigid structure in genus 2 discovered by calta and mcmullen .      in the following section",
    ", we briefly recall background .",
    "further background material appears in the initial piece of section  [ sectrisurf ] .",
    "that section ends with a presentation of the normalized form of the veech examples . in section  [ secapplyingleut ] , we apply work of leutbecher and of later authors to reduce to a finite number of cases .",
    "section  [ secnonparab ] rules out the remaining cases by providing explicit examples of special affine pseudo - anosov maps on veech surfaces .",
    "finally , in the appendix , based largely on the paper @xcite of d. h.  lehmer , we clarify the relationship between various trigonometric fields .",
    "the second - named author will keep available on his home page a mathematica notebook containing the basic computations for the examples for @xmath14 of subsection  [ subeven ] . at the time of the submission of this manuscript ,",
    "the following is a url for this file     http://oregonstate.edu/  schmidtt / ourpapers / arnoux / ascode.nb      the present note remained in nascent form for several years .",
    "indeed , the results of section  [ secapplyingleut ] are referred to in @xcite .",
    "we have benefited from the prompting of p. hubert and from discussions with him , e. lanneau and j. schmurr .",
    "we briefly recall terminology and give more detailed motivation for this work .",
    "a _ translation surface _ is a real surface with an atlas such that , off of a finite number of points , transition functions are translations . from the euclidean plane",
    ", this punctured surface inherits a flat metric , and this metric extends to the complete translation surface , with ( possibly removable ) conical singularities at the punctures . due to the transition function",
    "being translations , directions of linear flow on a translation surface are well - defined .",
    "post - composing the coordinate function of a chart from the atlas of a translation surface with any element of @xmath15 results in a new translation surface .",
    "this action preserves both the underlying topology and the types of the conical singularities .",
    "related to this , an _ affine diffeomorphism _ of the translation surface is a homomorphism that restricts to be a diffeomorphism on the punctured flat surface whose derivative is a _ constant _ @xmath16 real matrix .",
    "w.   veech @xcite showed that for any compact translation surface , the matrices that arise as such derivatives of ( orientation- and area - preserving ) affine diffeomorphisms form a discrete subgroup of @xmath17 , thus form a fuchsian group , now referred to as the _ veech group _ of the surface .",
    "furthermore , veech showed that if this group is a lattice ( that is , if it is of finite co - area ) , then the directions for flow on the translation surface enjoys the aforementioned dichotomy .",
    "such surfaces are now referred to as _",
    "veech surfaces_.    perhaps the main reason that w.  thurston introduced the notion of affine diffeomorphism is that it allows visualization of the action of a pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism , see @xcite  an affine diffeomorphism is a pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism exactly when its derivative is a hyperbolic matrix ( thus of trace greater than 2 in absolute value ) .",
    "the two real fixed points of this matrix give the expanding and contracting directions of the diffeomorphism .",
    "we refer to these diffeomorphisms as _ affine pseudo - anosov _ diffeomorphisms .",
    "an interval exchange is an interval map that acts by translating subintervals .",
    "the sah - arnoux - fathi invariant , or simply _ saf - invariant _ , of an interval exchange map is @xmath18 if the interval exchange takes intervals of lengths @xmath19 and translates them by the various @xmath20 .",
    "this invariant defines a homomorphism from the group ( under composition ) of interval exchange maps to the additive group @xmath21 , hence it vanishes whenever the interval exchange map is completely periodic .",
    "it can be proved that a minimal exchange map whose translation lengths generate a rank 2 @xmath22-module has non - vanishing invariant .",
    "this is in particular the case if the translation lengths belong to a fixed quadratic field ; hence any interval exchange map that is quadratic in this sense and has a null invariant is either periodic or reducible , see @xcite .",
    "note that this is no longer the case in higher degree : for any @xmath23 , there are minimal exchange maps with lengths in an algebraic field of degree @xmath24 and a null invariant , @xcite .",
    "when we consider a flow preserving a transverse measure on a surface , to any tranverse interval we can associate a first return map which is an interval exchange map .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that , as long as the interval cuts every orbit of the flow , the invariant does not depend on the choice of the interval , but only on the flow , see @xcite .",
    "if the flow is minimal , the invariant is the same for all choices of the interval ; otherwise , it is the sum of the invariants of the minimal components .",
    "kenyon and smillie @xcite introduced an invariant for translation surfaces , the @xmath25-invariant , that takes values in @xmath26 .",
    "they showed that appropriate projections of the @xmath25-invariant of the surface give the saf - invariants associated to the directions @xmath4 and the surface .",
    "if the direction is _ completely periodic _ , in the sense that every orbit of the flow is either periodic , or a saddle connection , then the saf - invariant of this direction vanishes . in particular , the aforementioned parabolic directions have vanishing saf - invariant .",
    "calta and smillie in @xcite show that if a translation surface has at least three directions with vanishing saf - invariant , then upon appropriately normalizing the surface , the set of slopes of vanishing saf - invariant forms the union of infinity with a field .",
    "they call this the _ periodic direction field _ , and say that the surface is in _",
    "standard form_.    each translation surface has a very natural set of directions  a _ holonomy _ direction for the surface is a direction for which some closed cycle exists .",
    "every completely periodic direction is certainly a holonomy direction , but in general the opposite inclusion does not hold : for example , there could be a closed cycle separating two minimal components . slightly more subtly ,",
    "a _ holonomy vector _ is defined by using the so - called developing map , and gives a flat representative of a cycle .",
    "kenyon and smillie @xcite defined the _ holonomy field _ to be the smallest field over which the set of holonomy vectors is contained in a two - dimensional vector space .",
    "gutkin and judge @xcite defined the _ trace field _ of a translation surface to be the field extension of the rationals generated by the traces of derivatives of the affine diffeomorphisms of the surface ; this is clearly a conjugacy invariant , and does not depend on the choice of a particular translation surface in the @xmath27-orbit .",
    "calta and smillie @xcite show that a veech surface has equality of its trace , holonomy and periodic direction fields .",
    "results of calta @xcite and of mcmullen @xcite show that on any genus two veech surface every direction of vanishing saf - invariant is a parabolic direction .",
    "this result uses the fact that the degree of the periodic direction field is bounded by the genus .",
    "indeed , as already alluded to in remark  [ remone ] , mcmullen @xcite shows that if the trace field of a veech surface is quadratic , then upon appropriately normalizing , the parabolic directions form the full trace field .    on the other hand , even in genus two , there are many translation surfaces ( with two singularities ) with directions that are completely periodic but not parabolic @xcite .",
    "also , there are examples of genus two surfaces with a direction of vanishing saf - invariant but for which the surface decomposes into a connected sum of tori , each of which is `` irrationally foliated '' in the given direction @xcite . in this case",
    "there are two minimal components with nonzero , but opposite , invariant , so that the global invariant vanishes .",
    "whereas in genus two this is the only manner to realize a non - completely periodic direction with vanishing saf - invariant ( see the corollary to theorem 3.7 of @xcite ) , in genus three and higher arnoux and yoccoz @xcite already gave examples of affine pseudo - anosov diffeomorphisms of vanishing saf - invariant ; see @xcite for recent work related to these examples . for none of these earlier examples of non - parabolic directions with vanishing saf - invariant",
    "is the underlying surface a veech surface .      given any fuchsian group , the _ trace field _",
    "is the field extension of @xmath11 generated by the traces of the elements of the group . in general , the eigenvalues belong to a quadratic extension of this field , but it can happen that an element of this trace field is the fixed point of a hyperbolic matrix @xmath28 in the group .",
    "the standard fixed point formula shows that this is the case if and only if @xmath29 is a square in this trace field .",
    "this curious phenomenon has been noted in other contexts , see in particular @xcite , where they call such @xmath28 _ special hyperbolic_.    we call an affine pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism _ special _ if its derivative is a special hyperbolic matrix . recall that the larger eigenvalue of this matrix is called the _ dilatation _ of the diffeomorphism . in general , the dilatation lies in a number field of degree at most twice the genus of the surface .",
    "usually , this bound is achieved .",
    "however , a special pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism has its dilatation in a field of `` unexpectedly '' lower degree .",
    "in the even index @xmath30 case , arnoux - hubert @xcite note that the interchange of veech s two regular @xmath1-gons defines an involution on the surface @xmath8 .",
    "the quotient is a translation surface that is equivalent to @xmath31 , the surface given by identifying by translation opposite sides of the regular @xmath1-gon gives a surface .",
    "it is easily verified that this quotient surface has the same parabolic directions , and indeed has its veech group equal to that of @xmath8 .    independently , earle and gardiner @xcite discussed the @xmath32 as triangle surfaces .",
    "let @xmath33 be a relatively prime triple of positive integers and let @xmath1 be their sum .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the translation surface arising from the unfolding of a euclidean triangle of angles @xmath35 . for odd @xmath1",
    ", one has @xmath36 ; earle - gardiner show that @xmath37 .",
    "recall that @xcite discusses the construction of triangle surfaces .",
    "let our triangle @xmath38 be of angles @xmath39 as above , and such that the side opposite @xmath40 is of length one and agrees with the real line along @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "thus the vertices of @xmath38 are @xmath42 and , say , @xmath43 . using the law of sines , the vertex @xmath44 has coordinates @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "calta and smilie @xcite , proof of theorem 1.4 , prove the following :    let @xmath33 be a relatively prime triple of positive integers , and let @xmath1 be their sum .",
    "then the trace field of @xmath47 is @xmath48 .    letting @xmath49 denote the triangle whose vertices are the complex conjugates of those of @xmath38 and @xmath50 be a primitive @xmath1th root of unity , using standard complex notation",
    ", @xcite shows that up to appropriate side identifications the surface @xmath51 can be given as the union @xmath52 .",
    "they also show that all vertices of this union are in @xmath53 .",
    "there are two natural actions of matrix groups in our setting , each giving a normal form for a translation surface .",
    "a translation surface is _ projectively normalized _ if all slopes of non - vertical homological directions lie in the trace field .",
    "a translation surface given as a collection of euclidean polygons with sides identified by translations is _ linearly normalized _ if all of the vertices have coordinates in the trace field .",
    "one easily verifies that a linearly normalized translation surface is projectively normalized .",
    "( for this , see the argument in the proof of calta - smillie theorem 1.4 in @xcite . ) the theorem itself can be expressed in the following manner .",
    "( calta - smillie @xcite ) any projectively normalized triangle surface has equality of its trace and periodic fields .",
    "taking into account lemma  [ ksimprts ] of the appendix , the aforementioned work of @xcite and @xcite implies the following .",
    "let @xmath54    [ correctnormalization ] let @xmath33 be a relatively prime triple of positive integers and let @xmath1 be their sum .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the translation surface resulting from the standard unfolding process of the triangle of angles @xmath55 and of vertices normalized as above .",
    "let @xmath56    then @xmath57 is linearly normalized .",
    "thus , the set of slopes of non - vertical directions of @xmath57 whose linear flow has vanishing saf - invariant is @xmath58 , the trace field of @xmath59 .",
    "j. schmurr @xcite points out that the authors of @xcite forgot to apply the above normalization in the proof of their theorem 1.4 ( he gives an alternate proof of their theorem in his 2008 oregon state university ph.d .",
    "dissertation ) .",
    "when the index @xmath1 is odd , the veech group of @xmath0 is a hyperbolic triangle fuchsian group of signature @xmath60  meaning that ( by way of its action on the hyperbolic plane ) it uniformizes a once punctured sphere with singularities of torsion index @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . when the index @xmath1 is even , the veech group is a subgroup of index two in a group of signature @xmath63 .",
    "the parabolic directions on a translation surface are in two - to - one correspondence with the parabolic fixed points of the veech group of the surface ( directions @xmath4 and @xmath64 have identical images ) . for brevity",
