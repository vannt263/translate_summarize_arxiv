    "several experimental groups have produced vortices in bose einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "one type of experiments consists in imposing a laser beam on the magnetic trap holding the atoms to create a harmonic anisotropic rotating potential . for a prolate trap ,",
    "it has been observed @xcite that when a single vortex exists , the vortex line is not straight along the axis of rotation , but bending .",
    "theoretical works @xcite establish a simpler expression of the gross pitaevskii energy that only depends on the vortex lines . in @xcite , it is proved that bending occurs for prolate condensates , but not for oblate ones .",
    "minimization algorithms @xcite have been used to compute local minima of the gross pitaevskii energy and provide an evidence of the bending in the same setting as the experiment . bending ( or @xmath0 )",
    "vortices are described in detail , and multiple vortex configurations are addressed in these studies .    recently , the ens group @xcite has further studied configurations with a single vortex line .",
    "they have observed planar bent vortices ( @xmath0 ) but also different configurations ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "they study the length of the line , its deviation from the center and its angular momentum .    in this paper , motivated by the recent experiments at the ens @xcite",
    ", we numerically look for local minimizers of the gross pitaevskii energy and we want to understand the various vortex configurations observed in the experimental setting : @xmath0 vortices but also @xmath1 vortices .",
    "we compute solutions with up to 4 vortices and describe their three - dimensional structure .",
    "different solution branches are followed and the evolution of the corresponding energy and angular momentum are shown . the framework of this study is the case of a prolate condensate where bending is an important phenomenon .",
    "we consider a pure bec of @xmath5 atoms confined in a harmonic trapping potential rotating along the @xmath6 axis at angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the equilibrium of the system corresponds to local minima of the gross - pitaevskii energy in the rotating frame    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and the wave function @xmath9 is normalized to unity @xmath10 . here , for any complex quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 and their complex conjugates",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    for numerical applications , it is more convenient to rescale the variables as follows : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 in this scaling the thomas - fermi limit of @xmath11 is [ rtf ] ( * r*)=0 -(x^2+^2y^2+^2z^2).then , we use the dimensionless energy introduced in @xcite [ be3d ] e(u ) = h(u ) - l_z(u),with [ h ] h(u)=_12 |u|^2 -12 ^ 2|u|^2 + 14 ^ 2|u|^4,[lz ] l_z(u)=i _ |u ( y - x ) , defined in the domain @xmath20      in the present study we compute critical points of @xmath21 by solving the norm - preserving imaginary time propagation of the corresponding equation : [ eqstrong ] -12u + i().u=1u(-|u|^2)+_u , with @xmath22 on @xmath23 and @xmath24 the lagrange multiplier for the norm constraint @xmath25 .",
    "a hybrid 3 steps runge - kutta - crank - nicolson scheme @xcite is used to advance the equation in time : @xmath26 where @xmath27 contains the remaining non - linear terms .",
    "the corresponding constants for every step ( @xmath28 ) are : @xmath29 the resulting semi - implicit scheme is second order time accurate and allows reasonably large time steps , making it appropriate for long time integration .",
    "the large sparse matrix linear systems resulting from the implicit terms are solved by an alternating direction implicit ( adi ) factorization technique .    for the spatial discretization",
    "we use finite differences on a cartesian uniform mesh with periodic boundary conditions in all directions . to accurately resolve sharp gradients of the variable in presence of vortices , low numerical dissipation and very accurate schemes",
    "are required for the spatial derivatives .",
    "a sixth - order compact finite difference scheme @xcite with spectral - like resolution was chosen to this end .",
    "the values of constants in ( [ eqstrong ] ) are set to @xmath30 corresponding to the experiments of the ens group @xcite ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "the angular frequency @xmath4 will be varied from 0 to the maximum value of @xmath35 , for which no deformation of the condensate has to be taken into account .",
    "equation ( [ eqstrong ] ) is propagated in imaginary time until the evolution of the energy ( [ be3d ] ) has a gradient in time smaller than @xmath36 . for the considered range of @xmath37 , the numerical domain",
    "is fixed to an elongated box @xmath38\\times[-0.6,0.6]\\times[-8.5 , 8.5]$ ] .",
    "a refined grid using @xmath39 nodes is employed , which is sufficient to achieve grid - independence for all considered numerical experiments .",
    "different initial conditions are used in to trigger single or multiple vortex configurations and follow the corresponding branches as @xmath4 is varied .",
    "the simplest initial condition assumes a steady - state solution @xmath40 and is useful to study vortex - free configurations and their degeneracy into multiple vortex configurations when increasing the value of @xmath37 .",
    "initial conditions with vortices are obtained by superimposing to the steady - state a simple ansatz for the vortex .",

    "the 3d shape of the vortex can be easily modified by shifting the center @xmath45 of the vortex in successive @xmath44 planes ; for instance , to obtain a planar s shape vortex , the following function can be used : @xmath46\\big / tanh(\\alpha_v ) , & z < 0 \\\\ 1 + tanh\\left[\\alpha_v \\left(-1+{\\displaystyle z\\over \\beta_v}\\right)\\right]\\big / tanh(\\alpha_v ) , & z \\geq 0    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the constants @xmath47 control , respectively , the curvature and the height of the vortex .",
    "we first focus on single vortex configurations and describe later multi vortex configurations .",
    "we have observed three different types of single vortex configurations as shown in figure [ fig-1v - all ] : planar @xmath0 vortices , planar @xmath1 vortices and non - planar @xmath1 vortices .",
    "the @xmath0 vortices are the bent vortices computed in @xcite and theoretically studied in @xcite .",
    "they are global minimizers of the energy .",
    "the @xmath1 configurations were observed experimentally very recently @xcite and are only local minimizers of the energy .",
    "vortex configurations for @xmath48 ( a ) , @xmath49 ( b ) , @xmath50 ( c ) . ]",
    "the @xmath0 vortex is a planar vortex formed of 2 parts : the central part is a line which stays on the @xmath6 axis and the outer part reaches the boundary of the condensate perpendicularly .",
    "when @xmath4 increases , the central straight part gets longer ( figure [ fig - u1-omega ] ) and the angular momentum ( @xmath51 ) increases to 1 ( figure [ fig - e1v ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 vortex is obtained by starting the simulation with an initial condition containing a straight vortex away from the @xmath6 axis .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 vortex lies either in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 plane . starting with an initial condition which is not in one of these plane yields a final state in the @xmath3 plane , which is the plane closest to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the shape of the the @xmath0 vortex and its preferred location in the @xmath3 plane can be analyzed using the approximate energy derived in @xcite : setting the vortex free solution to 0 energy , then the energy of a vortex line @xmath52 can be approximated by [ env ] e_= _  dl - c _ ^2  dz , where @xmath53 is a constant which depends on the experimental parameters and @xmath54 is given by ( [ rtf ] ) .",
    "if @xmath52 is not in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 plane , then one can construct small perturbations of @xmath52 that preserve @xmath54 and lower the energy .",
    "this implies that @xmath52 can not be a critical point of the energy because the gradient is not zero .",
    "of course , if the ellipticity of the cross section is small , the gradient is small , which may allow to observe these configurations .    in order to understand the existence of the straight central part of the @xmath0 vortex",
    ", one can also refer to the analysis of @xcite : from equation ( [ env ] ) we can infer that a vortex line with a lower energy than the vortex free solution is obtained when the quantity @xmath55 is negative , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be such that @xmath58 ; it corresponds to the 2d critical velocity for the existence of a vortex in the plane @xmath59 . for @xmath4 close to @xmath60 , the inner region where @xmath61 is concentrated near the center of the condensate . in this region ,",
    "the vortex line has to be straight ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this straight part is getting longer as @xmath4 increases since the region where @xmath62 is getting bigger .",
    "this region corresponds to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the critical velocity for the existence of a vortex in the 2 dimensional section where @xmath6 is constant . in the outer region",
    ", the vortex reaches the boundary using the shortest path .",
    "figure [ fig - e1v ] shows the energy and angular momentum variation with @xmath37 for the single vortex configurations .",
    "the @xmath0 vortices exist only for @xmath4 bigger than a critical value @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath66 , the energy of the @xmath0 vortex is bigger than the energy of the vortex free solution ( we have set to zero the energy of the vortex free solution ) .",
    "a zoom in this region shows that @xmath66 is very close to the angular velocity @xmath67 for which the energy of the vortex free solution is equal to the energy of the @xmath0 vortex .    ) and angular momentum per particle ( in units of @xmath68 ) for the single vortex configurations . ]",
    "figure [ fig - e1v ] also shows that the angular momentum @xmath51 of the @xmath0 vortex for @xmath69 does not go to 0 .",
    "this suggests that in fact there could be another @xmath0 solution for @xmath70 . using an ansatz ,",
    "another type of @xmath0 solution is obtained in @xcite which is a saddle point of the energy : it is away from the axis and has lower angular momentum . in @xcite , it is proved rigorously that for @xmath4 small , there is no @xmath0 as a critical point of the energy .",
    "for an initial condition with a straight vortex centered on the @xmath6 axis , if @xmath71 , the straight vortex is unstable and the final configuration is a @xmath0 , but if @xmath72 , the straight vortex is stable .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of @xcite where the local stability of the straight vortex for @xmath4 larger is proved .    for small @xmath4",
    ", the @xmath0 vortex disappears and a vortex - free configuration is obtained , while for @xmath4 larger the @xmath0 vortex degenerates into a three - vortex configuration ( described later ) .      motivated by the experiments of @xcite , we compute new critical points of the energy , which are @xmath1 configurations ( see figure [ fig-1v - all ] ) .",
    "several numerical experiments were performed , starting from different initial conditions containing an ansatz for the @xmath1 vortex ( see section [ sec - param ] ) .",
    "the planar @xmath1 can be regarded as a @xmath0 , with the half - part in the plane @xmath73 rotated with respect to the @xmath6 axis by 180 degrees ( see figure [ fig - u1s1 ] ) .",
    "the non planar @xmath1 are such that the projections of the branches on the @xmath74 plane are orthogonal , _ i.e. _ the rotation of the branches is of 90 degrees .",
    "we could check that non planar @xmath1 configurations with an angle between the branches different from 90 degrees do not exist .    .",
    "superposition of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vortex ( a ) and the planar and non - planar @xmath1 vortex ( b ) .",
    "]    as already mentioned for the @xmath0 vortex , stable planar @xmath1 configurations lie either in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 plane . as for the @xmath0 ,",
    "this can be explained using the limiting energy obtained in @xcite and considering separately the upper or lower part of the @xmath1 .",
    "as soon as the cross section is not a disc , if the upper or lower branch of the @xmath1 configuration does not lie in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 plane , then the gradient of vortex line energy ( [ env ] ) can never be zero when @xmath52 is varied .",
    "vortex configuration for @xmath75 ( a ) , @xmath76 ( b ) , @xmath77 ( c ) . ]",
    "the @xmath1 vortices exist for all values of @xmath4 while the @xmath0 only exist for @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath4 decreases , the extension of the @xmath1 along the @xmath6 axis goes downwards as shown in figure [ fig - s1-omega ] , the angular momentum decreases to 0 ( figure [ fig - e1v ] ) and the vortex tends to the horizontal axis .",
    "note that a vortex along the horizontal axis has @xmath78 , but a positive energy . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath4 increases , the @xmath1 gets straighter and it tends to the vertical axis .",
    "the global minimum of the energy is never an @xmath1 .",
    "but the difference in energy ( and angular momentum ) between @xmath0 and @xmath1 vortices is very small , as illustrated in figure [ fig - e1v ] because an @xmath1 vortex is almost like a @xmath0 with a half - part rotated by 180 degrees .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the minimization problem which is related to the experiments , is rather to minimize @xmath80 ( see ( [ h ] ) while fixing @xmath51 , rather than minimizing @xmath81 .",
    "this has been studied in the 2 dimensionnal setting in@xcite .",
    "one can notice that if a given configuration with @xmath82 and @xmath83 minimizes @xmath81 for some @xmath4 , then @xmath84 minimizes @xmath80 under the constraint that @xmath83 : indeed if @xmath85 with @xmath86 , then @xmath87 , since @xmath88 minimizes @xmath89 , and this implies that @xmath90 .",
    "moreover @xmath4 is the slope to the curve @xmath91 at the point @xmath88 and the property of minimizing @xmath89 that is for all @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 implies that the curve @xmath91 lies above its tangent at this point .",
    "we have plotted @xmath80 as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "we can check that the curve is convex , and above its tangent , which is consistent with the fact that we have computed minimizers of the energy .",
    "we know that the @xmath0 solution exists for @xmath95 and has @xmath96 . for @xmath97 , we expect that the process of minimizing @xmath80 with fixed @xmath51 would produce @xmath0 vortices and the curve @xmath91 should be concave in this region . in @xcite , we have proved that for @xmath51 close to 0 , @xmath98 , which is a first indication to the concavity of the curve .",
    "multiple vortex configurations are obtained based upon different numerical strategies .",
    "the first one is to start the computation from a vortex - free steady state and to abruptly increase @xmath37 to a very hight value ; multiple vortices are thus obtained . the second strategy is to generate an initial condition with vortices as described in section [ sec - param ] ( the advantage being the control of the shape and initial arrangement of the vortices ) .",
    "both techniques are used to follow solution branches with two , three or four vortices in the condensate .",
