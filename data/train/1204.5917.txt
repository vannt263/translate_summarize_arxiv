    "the concept of entanglement and non - locality @xcite , one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics , has been heavily debated since the early days of the field @xcite . by now , there is abundant experimental evidence @xcite that nature indeed does possess nonlocal aspects , in stark contrast to our everyday - life experience .",
    "but it was only relatively recently , when richard feynman @xcite , david deutsch @xcite , and other researchers in the 1980s , envisioned the idea of exploiting the quantum degrees of freedom for a novel way of information processing .",
    "the central question at the time was whether and how it is possible to efficiently simulate any finite physical system with a man - made machine .",
    "deutsch argued that such a simulation is not possible perfectly within the classical computational framework that had been developed for decades @xcite .",
    "instead , the universal computing machine should be of a quantum nature , i.e. , a `` quantum computer '' .    since then , progress in different areas of research and industry tremendously influenced the advent of quantum computing .",
    "first , the booming computer industry led to major progress in semiconductor- , nano- , and laser - technology , a prerequisite for the fabrication , addressing , and manipulation of single quantum systems needed in an experimental realization .",
    "second , several algorithms have been developed by now , such as those by deutsch @xcite , grover @xcite , and shor @xcite , which clearly illustrate that quantum computers , exploiting the existence of entanglement , can solve problems much faster than classical computers .",
    "a recent review on using quantum computers for quantum simulations can be found in ref .",
    "in addition , the theories of quantum complexity and entanglement are currently being established , a process which is still far from being complete .",
    "the emerging fields of nano- and quantum information science have inspired and motivated each other in various ways , today more than ever .    shortly after the first quantum algorithms had been developed , setups",
    "have been suggested to turn quantum computing into reality .",
    "these ideas , among others , are based on quantum dots @xcite , cold trapped ions @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , bulk nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , low - capacitance josephson junctions @xcite , donor atoms @xcite , linear optics @xcite , molecular magnets @xcite , spin clusters @xcite , or color centers in diamond @xcite .",

    "quantum dots ( qds ) confine electrons or holes ( missing valence band electrons ) in all three dimensions , on length scales which are comparable to the wavelengths of the particles , i.e. , typically @xmath7 in each spatial direction .",
    "there are many possibilities to realize such confinement , which is evident from the variety of systems under study . in this report , we will mainly focus on three of them .",
    "the first category is self - assembled qds .",
    "these form naturally during growth , where ingaas dots within a gaas matrix are commonly used examples .",
    "when ingaas is grown on gaas ( stranski - krastanov mode ) , islands form spontaneously after a small critical thickness of only a few monolayers due to the mismatch in the lattice constants .",
    "these may then be covered with further layers of gaas .",
    "such qds are typically lens - shaped , with heights of @xmath8 ( growth direction ) and diameters @xmath9 , and confinement results from the difference in the conduction and valence band edges of the involved materials .",
    "alternatively , interface fluctuation qds arise from monolayer fluctuations in thin quantum wells , typically resulting in gaas dots within algaas @xcite .",
    "the second category , lateral qds , is based on two - dimensional electron and hole gases ( 2degs , 2dhgs ) , which exist in heterostructures from materials with suitable band properties and additional dopants .",
    "for instance , algaas / gaas heterostructures are routinely used to form 2degs and 2dhgs within gaas , strongly confined along the growth direction .",
    "lithographically defined gate electrodes on the sample surface allow to create confinement also in the transverse directions , leading to quasi-2d qds of @xmath10 in diameter . finally , semiconductor nanowires naturally provide confinement in two dimensions , due to their small diameters of @xmath11 , and repulsive forces along the wire may again be added via nearby gates or via additional layers of barrier material .",
    "we note that several other qd implementations exist , which , however , for space reasons will not be discussed here .",
    "prominent examples are qds in carbon - based systems , like graphene @xcite or carbon nanotubes @xcite , which are highly attractive for implementing spin qubits .",
    "any setup considered for quantum computation should fulfill a list of essential criteria , such as scalability and the ability to initialize the system in a fiducial state @xcite . for quantum error correction schemes to be applicable , it is important that the lifetimes are much longer than the gate operation times .",
    "a decade ago , this had been considered a very serious challenge , by now this problem seems to have been overcome in qds as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : recentprogress ] .",
    "three time scales are of interest in this context , which we illustrate in terms of the electron spin qubit states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , assuming that these are eigenstates of the pauli operator @xmath14 with energy difference @xmath15 .",
    "first , the relaxation time @xmath4 describes transitions @xmath16 due to interactions with the environment , such as the lattice , which leads to relaxation from the excited @xmath12 to the ground state @xmath13 .",
    "a typical measure for @xmath4 is @xmath17 with initial state @xmath12 .",
    "second , the decoherence time @xmath5 quantifies the decay of quantum mechanical superpositions , and accounts for transitions of type @xmath18 induced by the environment ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ figuredecoherencescience ] ) . when the state is initially @xmath19 , an eigenstate of @xmath20 , a typical measure for @xmath5 is the envelope function of @xmath21 .",
    "we note that @xmath21 oscillates between @xmath22 at angular frequency @xmath23 for a perfectly isolated system , but decays to 0 as the state turns into either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the envelope function itself may be referred to as @xmath24 .",
    "finally , in practice it is generally required to average over an ensemble , rather than to measure a single system only .",
    "the averaged @xmath25 often decays faster than in each individual case , because the oscillation frequencies may be slightly different from system to system ( e.g. , small deviations in @xmath15 ) , which leads to destructive interference and additional damping . the so - called dephasing time obtained from an ensemble measurement is therefore labeled @xmath26 .",
    "the three time scales @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath26 are not completely unrelated .",
    "one finds that @xmath27 , and usually @xmath28 and @xmath29 in practice . in qds",
    ", decoherence typically results from the nuclear spins and also the spin - orbit interaction . commenting on the terminology ,",
    "the relaxation ( @xmath4 ) , decoherence ( @xmath5 ) , and dephasing ( @xmath26 ) times are only well defined when @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively , decay exponentially , which is the assumed behavior in most quantum error correction schemes .",
    "strictly speaking , one should therefore avoid these terms when the longitudinal or transverse decay is of a non - exponential form .",
    "we note , however , that the introduced nomenclature is often being used to characterize any decaying behavior for convenience .    a key criterion for building quantum computers , the one which actually justifies their name , is the presence of a universal set of quantum gates .",
    "this may fortunately be realized with one- and two - body interactions only , since any operation can be carried out as a sequence of one- and two - qubit gates .",
    "in fact , the implementation of single - qubit rotations for each element , along with only one type of entangling two - qubit gates , e.g. , @xmath32 or cnot , between neighboring qubits would be sufficient for universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that entanglement of spin qubits can be created in many different ways and over long distances , for instance , by extracting and separating cooper pairs from an s - wave superconductor as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimentally investigated recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . nuclear spins and spin - orbit interaction , which present an undesired source of decoherence on the one hand ,",
    "may prove useful for implementing qubit gates on the other hand , and both mechanisms will therefore be analyzed in more detail in the next section .",
    "spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) couples the orbital motion of a charge to its spin and arises in the presence of inversion asymmetry , where two types can be distinguished .",
    "rashba soi results from structural inversion asymmetry and , for electrons , is typically of the form @xmath33 , where the components @xmath34 are the standard pauli matrices for spin 1/2 , @xmath35 is the momentum operator , and @xmath36 is an effective electric field determined by the system structure @xcite .",
    "dresselhaus soi is present in materials that lack bulk inversion symmetry , such as inas or gaas , and is of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 correspond to the crystallographic directions @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 $ ] , and @xmath43 $ ] , respectively @xcite .    for quasi-2d systems",
    ", these hamiltonians can be reduced further . for strong confinement along the @xmath44 direction",
    ", the rashba term simplifies to @xmath45 with rashba parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting form of the dresselhaus term strongly depends on the growth direction . for the @xmath44 axis chosen along the confinement direction",
    ", one can substitute @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and all other terms can be neglected because of their smallness compared to terms @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath50 $ ] one obtains @xmath51 , while for @xmath52 $ ] the spin projection along the confinement direction is conserved , @xmath53 .",
    "both these hamiltonians vary under rotations of the coordinate system about the @xmath44 axis , so that their exact form is determined by the relative orientation of coordinate and crystal axes .",
    "this is different for @xmath54 $ ] , where the effective dresselhaus term is @xmath55 , which moreover corresponds exactly to the form of the rashba term .",
    "therefore , rashba and dresselhaus soi can cancel in lowest order for growth along the @xmath56 $ ] direction @xcite .",
    "we note that the presence of soi results in small , but finite , anisotropic corrections to the heisenberg exchange interaction of electron spins , thus affecting the fidelity of quantum gates based on isotropic exchange .",
    "fortunately , strategies have been developed with which the soi - induced gate errors can be strongly suppressed @xcite . in general , gate errors can be reduced from first to second ( or higher ) order in soi when the coupling strength @xmath0 is varied symmetrically in time , followed by additional qubit rotations @xcite . in particular , the anisotropic corrections can be cancelled completely in the cnot gate construction of ref .",
    "@xcite when the system is pulsed such that the anisotropic terms are linear in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "additional errors caused by dipole - dipole interactions were found to be negligible for cnot ( in typical situations ) @xcite .",
    "a rather useful technique for electrically controlled qubit rotations is the electric - dipole - induced spin resonance ( edsr ) .",
    "it is closely related to the well - known electron spin resonance ( esr ) , which we therefore review first . for this , let us consider an electron in a qd in the presence of magnetic fields .",

    "we note that the resulting spin - flip probability is completely equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ esrresult ] ) when the spin is initially down .",
    "remarkably , in the presence of soi one finds that an oscillating electric field @xmath80 leads to an effective magnetic field @xmath81 with , in general , non - zero components perpendicular to the static magnetic field .",
    "hence , spin rotations can efficiently be driven by purely electrical means ( edsr ) .",
    "this may be achieved by applying ac voltages to nearby gates , at frequencies which are in resonance with the zeeman splitting , as recently exploited in experiments on nanowire - based inas and insb qds @xcite .",

    "first , in contrast to esr , the edsr arises from coupling to other orbital states and therefore depends on the level spacing .",
    "this can easily be seen , since @xmath84 , so that neither the dipolar term @xmath85 nor @xmath86 or @xmath87 couple the spin states in lowest order .",
    "a unitary schrieffer - wolff transformation shows that the leading term for edsr is a combination of zeeman coupling and soi .",

    "as the magnetic fields become very large , the wavelengths of the phonons with energy @xmath94 eventually become much smaller than the size of the qd , i.e. , the phonon - induced effects average out when integrating over the electron wave function and @xmath4 increases rather than decreases @xcite .",
    "maximal relaxation rates are usually observed when the phonon wavelength matches the dot size @xcite . in the other limit , for very small magnetic fields , the derived expression for @xmath4 diverges .",
    "this is because the above theory focuses on single - phonon processes , so that only phonons in resonance with the zeeman transition can contribute .",
    "theorem forbids soi - induced spin relaxation in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite , which is also the reason why edsr requires the presence of a finite magnetic field .",
    "when two - phonon processes are included , @xmath4 converges to a finite value @xcite .",

    "electron spin coherence is irreversibly lost and the spin components converge to constant values , slightly below the initial values only , where the system remains until dipole - dipole interactions among the nuclear spins become relevant @xcite . for @xmath145 , assuming a gaussian envelope wave function , this asymptotic time decay evolves according to @xmath146 and @xmath147 for 3d and 2d qds , respectively , where @xmath148 . at large @xmath61 , this decay is @xmath149 and @xmath150 in 3d and 2d dots , in agreement with the systematic solutions of the generalized master equation @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics have also been investigated for heavy - holes in quasi-2d qds @xcite . assuming the strong confinement along the @xmath44 axis , we recall that the states can be classified according to their angular momenta ( effective spins ) @xmath151 , where @xmath152 quantifies the size and @xmath153 is the @xmath44-projection in units of @xmath154 .",
    "this results from the strong soi in the valence band , coupling the electron spin to the @xmath106-type bloch functions .",
    "heavy - holes ( hhs ) have @xmath155 , while light - hole ( lh ) states have @xmath156 , and the two bands are energetically well separated in 2d - like qds .",
    "even though the contact hyperfine term is absent , the remaining mechanisms , i.e. , anisotropic hyperfine interaction and coupling to the orbital angular momentum , turn out to be rather strong , in typical iii - v compounds only one order of magnitude weaker than the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the coupling of the hh to the nuclear spin bath takes on a simple ising form in leading order , @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the coupling to the @xmath159th nucleus , @xmath160 denotes the @xmath44 component of the @xmath159th nuclear spin in units of @xmath154 , and @xmath161 is the hh pseudospin operator with eigenvalues @xmath162 for @xmath163 @xcite .",

    "the transverse hole spin decay depends on the orientation of the external magnetic field @xmath60 . for zero field or @xmath165 , dephasing results in a gaussian time decay , as for electrons , with time scales of typically a few tens of ns @xcite",
    ". however , due to the ising - type rather than heisenberg - type hh - nuclear - spin interaction , the situation changes drastically for an in - plane magnetic field @xmath166 .",
    "since the hyperfine fluctuations are now purely perpendicular to the applied field , one finds that the transverse hole spin decays @xmath167 at long times in the limit @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the externally induced zeeman splitting , @xmath170 is the in - plane hh @xmath1 factor , and @xmath171 is the variance of the nuclear field @xmath172 @xcite . for typical gaas qds and magnetic fields of a few tesla ,",
    "the associated decay times are long , around tens of @xmath173s @xcite . only a few months after these calculations were published , an experiment on self - assembled ingaas qds with @xmath166 confirmed that hh spins in 2d - like qds are highly coherent , with @xmath174 ( @xmath175 with @xmath176 probability ) reported for the setup under study @xcite .    for applications which require large zeeman splittings ,",
    "an in - plane magnetic field may be inconvenient because @xmath170 is usually much smaller than the hh @xmath1 factor @xmath177 along the axis of strong confinement .",
    "long coherence times for @xmath165 can be achieved as well , namely by preparing the nuclear spin bath in a narrowed state @xcite .",
    "when the nuclear spins are initially in an eigenstate of @xmath172 , with @xmath165 , decoherence can only result from additional transverse terms in the hh - nuclear - spin coupling which then allow for flip - flop processes .",
    "these additional terms mainly arise from coupling to neighboring bands , i.e. , the conduction band , lh band , and split - off band , and are about one to two orders of magnitude weaker than the dominant ising term @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the time decay of the transverse spin due to band hybridization is purely exponential , and that the decoherence time @xmath5 can be tuned over several orders of magnitude via the applied magnetic field .",
    "in fact , decoherence due to nuclear spins can be so strongly suppressed that other mechanisms , like the dipole - dipole interaction or the phonon bath , should take over as the dominant sources of transverse spin decay @xcite .",
    "calculations on self - assembled qds showed that the ising - like form of the hyperfine coupling is preserved for realistic strain distributions @xcite .",
    "the strain considerably affects the hyperfine - induced hole spin decoherence , largely through coupling to the conduction band , allowing to tune @xmath5 by an order of magnitude for fixed zeeman splittings @xcite .",
    "as summarized above , the electron and hole spin decoherence induced by nuclear spins can be strongly suppressed when the nuclear spin bath is initialized in a narrowed state .",
    "moreover , the effective nuclear magnetic field , up to @xmath178 for electrons in gaas qds , allows to realize large magnetic field gradients among neighboring qds @xcite and to tune the resonance energies in optically active qds over several tens of @xmath173ev @xcite .",
    "therefore , nuclear spins are more and more considered a source of opportunity rather than trouble , leading to enormous experimental efforts in this field .",
    "dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) schemes are usually based on the isotropic contact hyperfine interaction among electron spin and nuclear spins .",
    "as illustrated in paragraph [ secsubsub : electronspindecoherence ] , eq .",
    "( [ equationflipflop ] ) , the transverse components of the overhauser field allow to polarize the nuclei via electron - nuclear - spin flip - flop processes , building up a large nuclear field @xmath179 with maximum overhauser shift @xmath180 .",
    "an example for dnp via the hole spin can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "dnp has been achieved experimentally by optical @xcite , electrical @xcite , and also magnetical @xcite driving , where it is impossible to completely list the large variety of approaches .",
    "polarizations @xmath181 have been reported so far @xcite , however , achieving @xmath182 remains a very challenging task .",
    "interestingly , many dnp schemes feature an intrinsic feedback mechanism which drives the system towards fixed , stable nuclear field values , so that the width of the nuclear field distribution is narrowed at the same time @xcite .",
    "similar effects have been demonstrated using pulsed optical excitation on an ensemble of qds @xcite , and it has been shown that efficient feedback loops may also be included intentionally @xcite .",
    "further promising approaches for the preparation of narrowed states are based on indirect measurement @xcite .",
    "we mention that all decay properties described earlier in this section correspond to the free - induction decay , i.e. , the case where the system evolves in the absence of externally applied control sequences .",
    "the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening can be undone to a large extent by applying spin - echo pulses , notably increasing the spin coherence times @xcite . in parallel",
    ", an alternative trend is to bypass the interaction with nuclear spins completely by switching to host materials such as ge and si , which can be grown nuclear - spin - free .",
    "examples for both approaches will be discussed in the next section , where we review recent progress toward quantum computation with spins in qds .",
    "finally , we note that an alternative route to reduce the nuclear spin noise ( besides narrowing and dnp ) would be to polarize the nuclear spins by freezing them out , either by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field on the order of @xmath183 at a few mk @xcite or by inducing an ordering transition of the nuclear spin system due to rkky interactions .",
    "the latter phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest in recent years , and we refer the interested reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "since the first proposals in the 1990s , researchers worldwide have been working hard toward the ambitious goal of implementing a quantum computer . in quantum dots ( qds ) , which we focus on in this report , seminal progress has been made within the past few years . in the following ,",
    "we summarize and discuss some of the key results , where we distinguish between self - assembled , lateral , and nanowire - based qds .",
    "a table at the end of this section , table [ tablecomparison ] , summarizes relevant information such as the measured lifetimes , and compares @xmath5 to reported operation times as commented below .",
    "quantum systems are sensitive , and errors inevitably occur in any realistic device .",
    "therefore , schemes for fault - tolerant quantum computing have been developed , where errors can automatically be corrected as long as they occur with low enough probability .",
    "the latter condition can usually be quantified in terms of a threshold rate @xcite .",
    "for instance , standard error correction schemes require that at least @xmath184 gate operations can be carried out within the decoherence time of a qubit @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , a novel scheme has been presented , referred to as the surface code @xcite .",
    "the logical qubits are encoded within several physical qubits each , all of which are arranged in a 2d lattice with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "logical single- and two - qubit gates are then performed via a series of projective measurements .",
    "this code is probably the most powerful quantum computing scheme presently known , with a remarkably large error threshold around 1% @xcite , so that @xmath185 operations per decoherence time may already be sufficient . when errors for readout become negligible , error correction in the surface code is even possible up to a threshold rate of currently 18.5% @xcite .",
    "the viability of topological error correction has recently been demonstrated in a first proof - of - principle experiment @xcite .",
    "for further information on fault - tolerant quantum computation with the surface code we refer to refs .",
    "a general overview on fault - tolerance is provided in @xcite .      as opposed to gate - defined qds",
    ", the confinement in self - assembled dots purely arises from the conduction and valence band offsets of the involved materials , leading to strong confinement on a very small scale in all three dimensions .",
    "therefore , self - assembled qds are typically operational at @xmath186 , the boiling temperature of @xmath187he .",
    "moreover , they are optically active and feature strong interband transitions with `` almost hard '' selection rules @xcite . exploiting this property , self - assembled qds",
    "are primarily studied using optical means , and heterostructures have been designed which allow precise control over the charge states @xcite .    for a qubit with basis @xmath188 and @xmath189",
    ", the general qubit state can be written as @xmath190 , neglecting global phases , where @xmath191 and @xmath192 correspond to the polar and azimuthal angle of a point on the bloch sphere .",
    "prerequisites for the implementation of a quantum computer are the abilities to initialize , to control , and to read out such a qubit state .",
    "all of this has been achieved by now .",
    "first , the spins of both electrons @xcite and holes @xcite can be initialized with @xmath193 fidelity .",
    "second , ultrashort optical pulses , combined with an externally induced zeeman splitting , have allowed for complete quantum control , i.e. , arbitrary rotations on the bloch sphere , with operation times on the order of only a few ps .",
    "again , this has successfully been demonstrated both on single electrons @xcite and single holes @xcite .",
    "recently , initialization and coherent control have also been reported for two - particle qubits defined by the spin singlet and triplet states of electrons @xcite and holes @xcite in vertically stacked qds .",
    "the latter , also referred to as qd molecules , form naturally during growth when a second layer of qds is grown on top of another .",
    "even though the position of the dots in the first layer is arbitrary , the qds in the second layer will form right on top of the first ones due to strain in the tunnel barrier grown inbetween .",
    "finally , several methods have been developed to read out the spin states .",
    "these include time - averaged readout via faraday rotations @xcite , kerr rotations @xcite , and resonance fluorescence @xcite . in addition",
    ", time - resolved kerr rotation spectroscopy has been reported @xcite , and it has been shown that qd molecules allow to measure the spin state of a single electron in real time via the resonance fluorescence @xcite .",
    "in the latter case , the presence of a second dot enables to use different optical transitions ( laser energies ) for the initialization and readout steps @xcite .",
    "dephasing and decoherence times have been measured .",
    "for single - electron spin qubits , dephasing results in @xmath194 @xcite depending on the exact system , while the observed decoherence times are @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "however , it has been verified already that @xmath26 can be significantly prolonged by narrowing the distribution of the nuclear field @xcite .",
    "for single holes , the reported @xmath196 @xcite and @xmath197 @xcite are similar to those for electrons , hence shorter than initially expected , which is attributed to electrical noise @xcite .",
    "measurements based on coherent population trapping , i.e. , in the frequency domain as opposed to the time domain , have revealed a much longer hole - spin dephasing time @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "electrical noise is also the reason for the short @xmath199 @xcite and @xmath200 @xcite observed for singlet - triplet qubits from electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "when the qd molecule is operated in a regime where the singlet - triplet splitting is less sensitive to fluctuating electric fields , @xmath26 can be increased by several orders of magnitude , and dephasing times up to have recently been measured for coupled electrons @xcite .",
    "importantly , comparing the listed @xmath5 to the notably short operation times of a few ( tens of ) ps illustrates that the threshold factor of @xmath184 for standard quantum error correction schemes has already been exceeded both in electron and hole systems . for",
    "reported spin relaxation times @xmath4 , see table [ tablecomparison ] .",
    "the optical properties make self - assembled qds highly promising candidates for applications as single - photon sources , and designs for enhanced extraction efficiencies are being developed @xcite .",
    "moreover , they may present an interface between `` stationary '' and `` flying '' qubits .",
    "recently , interference of single photons from two separate qds has been demonstrated @xcite , which is a promising approach for generating entanglement and implementing two - qubit gates between distant spins . since different qds , unlike atoms , have different resonance energies , this requires the ability to tune the level structure of a dot for the photon energies to be matchable .",
    "such fine tuning may be achieved via strain @xcite , via the stark effect @xcite , or by polarizing the nuclear spins up to a desired ( overhauser ) nuclear magnetic field .",
    "dynamic nuclear polarization in single self - assembled qds has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "for instance , schemes exist both for high @xcite and low @xcite external magnetic fields which allow for continuous , bidirectional tuning of the overhauser field , fully controlled by the laser wavelength .",
    "both schemes are also capable of narrowing the width of the nuclear field distribution @xcite .    as an alternative to the widely studied iii - v compounds ,",
    "self - assembled qds can also be grown from group iv materials .",
    "a prominent example are self - assembled ge qds on si substrates . due to the indirect band gap of ge and si ,",
    "these dots are not as optically active as typical iii - v qds @xcite .",
    "self - assembled ge / si qds are subject to large experimental efforts , and detailed knowledge about growth and the electrical and optical properties has been gained @xcite .",
    "substantial progress has been made on implementing gate - controlled qubits within the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of a heterostructure .",
    "experiments have predominantly been carried out on gaas qds within algaas / gaas heterostructures , which therefore should be considered to be the host material in the following , unless stated otherwise .",
    "mainly , two different approaches for encoding the qubit have emerged .",
    "the first one follows the original proposal @xcite , using the spin eigenstates @xmath12 and @xmath13 of single electrons .",
    "the second scheme uses the singlet @xmath201 and triplet @xmath202 states of two electron spins , forming an @xmath203-@xmath204 qubit @xcite .",
    "we summarize the results for both approaches in the following .",
    "alternatively , @xmath203-@xmath205 qubits @xcite and qubits from three - spin states @xcite are currently under investigation .      in the @xmath203-@xmath204 approach ,",
    "every qubit is formed by two electrons in two adjacent qds , where the charge configuration and the overlap of the electron wave functions depend on the shape of the confining potential , which in turn is determined by the applied gate voltages . within the frame of this review",
    "it is sufficient to distinguish the two charge configurations ( 1,1 ) and ( 0,2 ) , which denotes that the electrons are found either in different dots or both in the `` right '' qd , respectively .",
    "coherent rotations @xmath206 are induced by a magnetic field gradient between the two qds , typically achieved by dynamic polarization of the nuclear spins @xcite or by a nearby positioned micromagnet @xcite . when the barrier is reduced such that the wave functions strongly overlap",
    ", the finite exchange energy gives rise to coherent rotations @xmath207 , i.e. , @xmath208 , thus allowing for arbitrary rotations on the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "these single - qubit operations can be carried out within a few ns only @xcite , and two - qubit gates may be implemented by capacitive coupling , where the charge configuration in one double quantum dot ( dqd ) affects the exchange energy and hence the precession frequency in the other dqd @xcite .",
    "charge - conditional phase flips of an @xmath203-@xmath204 qubit have recently been demonstrated in four - dot systems @xcite , and it was verified experimentally that the resulting cphase gate between two @xmath203-@xmath204 qubits is entangling @xcite .    for initialization , the potential energy in one of the dots is reduced such that both electrons tend to occupy the ground state of the same qd .",
    "this sets the qubit in the singlet state , because the symmetric orbital part of the two - electron wave function requires an antisymmetric contribution of the spin .",
    "after operation in the ( 1,1 ) regime , the same idea also allows for spin - to - charge conversion and therefore presents a popular basis for readout schemes .",
    "having reduced the potential energy in one qd , the system changes to ( 0,2 ) for @xmath209 , but remains in ( 1,1 ) for @xmath210 due to pauli exclusion .",
    "the charge state can be detected via nearby quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) @xcite , which may furthermore be embedded in radio - frequency ( rf ) impedance matching circuits to allow for faster readout @xcite .",
    "however , the quality of the outcome ( readout visibility , see also sec .",
    "[ secsub : overviewprogress ] ) strongly depends on the triplet relaxation time at the measurement point , which may be clearly reduced in the presence of large magnetic field gradients @xcite , and implementing schemes for fast and reliable single - shot readout therefore remains an important task .",
    "recently , single - shot measurements with measurement times down to 100 ns have been reported , using an rf sensor qd which is much more sensitive than standard qpcs @xcite . as an alternative approach , dispersive readout of spin singlet and",
    "triplet states has been demonstrated with an rf resonant circuit coupled to a dqd @xcite .",
    "also , readout via spin - dependent tunnel rates has been achieved for the singlet and triplet states in a single qd @xcite .",
    "even though the random distribution of the nuclear spins leads to rapid dephasing within @xmath211 @xcite , two - electron spin states feature very long coherence times .",
    "a single echo pulse increases the dephasing time to a few @xmath173s already @xcite , and more sophisticated pulse sequences have demonstrated coherence times on the order of a hundred @xmath173s @xcite , where @xmath212 currently corresponds to the largest value reported so far @xcite . assuming that the two - qubit gates can be operated on a similar time scale ( ns ) as the single - qubit gates , the threshold value of @xmath184 operations per decoherence time is hence clearly exceeded .",
    "as we summarize in the following , this similarly holds for the case where the qubits are encoded in the spin states of single electrons .",
    "the two eigenstates of a single electron in a qd , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are split by an effective zeeman energy via coupling to external and internal ( overhauser ) magnetic fields .",
    "this energy difference gives rise to coherent single - qubit rotations @xmath213 .",
    "rotations about the second axis of the bloch sphere , @xmath214 , can be driven by means of e(d)sr , which we introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : soiandnuclearspins ] of this review .",
    "finally , two - qubit gates such as @xmath32 and swap can be implemented by controlling the overlap of the wave functions and hence the exchange energy for neighboring electrons .",
    "thirteen years after publication of the original proposal @xcite , the elementary unit of an all - electrical `` spin - qubit processor '' has now been implemented for the first time , demonstrating independently controllable single - spin rotations combined with inter - dot spin exchange in a dqd @xcite .",
    "an important part of the setup in ref .",
    "@xcite is a micromagnet at the sample surface , whose stray field provides a time - independent magnetic field gradient at the qds .",
    "this gradient is useful for two reasons .",
    "first , it allows for efficient and electrically driven esr ; an oscillating electric field slightly shifts the position of the electron in the qd , so that the electron `` feels '' an oscillating magnetic field of the same frequency without the need for soi @xcite .",
    "second , it leads to shifted resonance frequencies in adjacent qds via a difference in the zeeman energies , so that neighboring qubits can be addressed individually @xcite .",
    "performance of the implemented spin - qubit processor was tested via a time - averaged readout scheme , using a nearby qpc to measure the average charge configuration when the system is tuned to the pauli spin blockade regime ( see also @xmath203-@xmath204 qubits above ) @xcite .",
    "a fully operational unit for quantum computation requires precise initialization and single - shot readout of the individual qubit states , which therefore still needs to be included .",
    "latest developments are promising @xcite , and independent single - shot readout of two electron spins in a dqd , with fidelities close to 90% , has recently been reported @xcite . in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , a time around @xmath215 was required for spin readout and initialization to @xmath12 , slightly shorter than the measured spin relaxation time of @xmath216 .",
    "the latter strongly depends on the regime of operation , i.e. , the applied gate voltages , and can take values @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "the decoherence times @xmath5 can be assumed to be much longer than a @xmath173s . for a single echo pulse and a magnetic field of @xmath218 only , a decay time near @xmath219 has been measured , and clearly longer coherence times can be expected at higher magnetic fields and more sophisticated pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "comparing @xmath5 to the typical operation times , we find that the threshold rates of proposed ( standard ) error correction protocols have already come close within reach , as summarized in the following . two - qubit gates are fast .",
    "for instance , swap operations @xmath220 require a time of order @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is planck s constant and @xmath152 is the exchange energy .",
    "they are routinely carried out within @xmath223 @xcite , and swap times @xmath224 have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , single - qubit rotations induced by the zeeman splitting typically occur on a sub - ns time scale . using the bulk @xmath1 factor @xmath225 for gaas and @xmath226 as the magnetic field along the quantization axis ,",
    "the @xmath227-rotation @xmath228 requires a time of order @xmath229 .",
    "the efficiency of the universal set of qubit gates is therefore limited by the operation time @xmath230 for coherently driven spin flips @xmath16 , where @xmath2 is the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the quantization axis ( see also paragraph [ secsubsub : esrandedsr ] ) . recently reported spin - flip times are on the order of several tens of ns , both for magnetically @xcite and electrically @xcite driven rotations , corresponding to @xmath231 .",
    "the efficiency of electrically controlled rotations may , among others , be improved by increasing the magnetic field gradient @xcite , or even , in a brute - force approach , by switching to host materials with stronger soi @xcite and larger @xmath1 factors .",
    "alternatively , coherent single - spin rotations about an arbitrary axis may be implemented using an auxiliary spin in a nearby qd with different zeeman field , which enables a purely exchange - based control without the need for soi or oscillating fields @xcite .",
    "such exchange - controlled single - qubit gates have not yet been realized experimentally ; theoretical results , however , are promising and point toward high fidelities , with gating times @xmath232 @xcite .      for both qubit encoding schemes , control over the nuclear spin bath is of great benefit .",
    "various methods for dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) have been developed and demonstrated @xcite , all of which may be used to generate large magnetic field gradients between neighboring qds .",
    "such gradients can be measured quantitatively via the cycle duration of oscillations @xmath206 @xcite , and differences @xmath233 in the overhauser field have been induced and subsequently exploited for coherent rotations on the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "in addition , schemes exist to reduce the width of the nuclear field distribution @xcite , allowing to strongly prolong the dephasing times @xcite .    besides gaas qds , other promising host materials are under investigation .",
    "in particular , rapid progress has been made on si qds within si / sige heterostructures @xcite .",
    "for instance , slow electron spin relaxation @xmath234 has recently been observed in this material via single - shot readout @xcite .",

    "as opposed to self - assembled qds , gate - defined systems can not confine electrons and holes at the same time and are therefore optically inactive @xcite .",
    "currently , experiments are almost exclusively carried out on gated 2degs , and new experimental challenges may be encountered when 2d hole gases are used instead @xcite . however , considering the long lifetimes predicted for heavy - holes in qds @xcite and the fact that strong magnetic field gradients may be induced via micromagnets @xcite , we think that hole spins can present a valuable alternative to electron spins .",

    "qds therein form when the confinement in the transverse directions , provided by the wire geometry , is supplemented with an additional confinement in the longitudinal direction , which can be achieved both via electric gates and via structured growth of materials with suitable band offsets . in the first case , coupling between neighboring qds is easily controllable via the gate voltages , while the second case is highly attractive for optical processes because electrons and holes can be stored at the same time ( see also self - assembled qds ) .",

    "the direct coupling of a single spin to the magnetic component of the cavity electromagnetic field , however , is weak , and achieving strong interactions between a spin qubit and a cavity thus requires other mechanisms , resulting in a variety of suggested approaches .",
