    "in this work , we will revisit the fock - darwin ( fd ) system @xcite with two main purposes : to examine in close detail its symmetries and its superintegrability character , and to give a complete picture of the system in both , the quantum and classical frameworks .",
    "the fd system consists in a charged particle moving in the plane and confined by a harmonic potential under an external uniform magnetic field . here",
    ", we are not taking into account the spin splitting in the magnetic field since this can be directly added at any stage .    the fd system has a number of applications in several fields .",
    "for example , it is used as frequent ingredient of quantum dots . due to the small size ( of a few nanometers ) , when the discrete energy levels are filled with electrons , the quantum dot is called artificial atom , an entity whose properties have been recently described . if there are more than one electron confined in the quantum dot , the coulomb interaction has to be taken into account . in this case ,",
    "approximation methods , like diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix or the constant interaction model @xcite , are available .    in works dealing with quantum dots ,",
    "the connection between ` accidental degeneracy ' and the symmetry group of a hamiltonian has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "this connection was studied long time ago for a hamiltonian describing a particle in a central potential @xcite . in general terms , a quantum system of @xmath3 degrees of freedom is called integrable if it has @xmath3 algebraically independent symmetry operators , including the hamiltonian , commuting with each other .",
    "when there are additional symmetry operators so that we have the maximum set of @xmath4 independent symmetry operators ( not necessarily commuting ) , the system is called superintegrable ( or sometimes maximally superintegrable ) @xcite . in the classical context ,",
    "the symmetries are replaced by constants of motion , and the commutativity by the vanishing of poisson brackets . in these definitions",
    "it is assumed that the symmetries ( or constants of motion ) are polynomials in the momenta .    in this paper , we address the characterization of the symmetries of the quantum fd system in a simple and consistent way .",
    "first of all , let us remember that the fd system has two limiting cases , the isotropic harmonic oscillator ( ho ) and the landau system , which are well known to be superintegrable systems , with second order symmetries leading to several sets of separable coordinates",
    ". however , for the generic fd system the situation is not so evident and depends on the ratio between two relevant frequencies , as we will see later .",
    "only if this ratio is rational the system ( called `` rational '' quantum fd system ) will be superintegrable . in this special case ,",
    "the symmetries are of higher order ( greater than two ) , a fact that will not allow for additional separable coordinate systems @xcite . as a consequence of the different symmetries of ho , landau and the general fd system , the corresponding eigenvalues have also different degeneracy properties : for the landau system there is an infinite degeneracy , in the ho each level has a finite degeneracy , and in the fd system there may be no degeneracy at all or a special finite degeneracy , depending on the above mentioned frequency ratio .    in the classical fd system , instead of symmetries",
    "we have to consider constants of motion .",
    "it turns out that the `` rational '' classical fd system is a superintegrable system where the bounded orbits of the motion are closed .",
    "in addition , the higher order constants of motion directly supply the equations of the trajectories and some of its properties .",
    "but also , these constants of motion are symmetry generators that will be studied in detailed . in particular , we will obtain finite symmetry transformations for a number of cases .",
    "the classical ho and landau systems are also included as limiting cases .    in order to see the relation between classical and quantum phenomena , it is important to study quantum coherent states . the coherent states associated to the the fd system have been studied under different conditions .",
    "the first contributions were due to feldman and manko @xcite , and more recent application have been given in @xcite .",
    "another important area where coherent states of fd type systems have been considered is in paraxial optics , where similar hamiltonians are used to describe some optical waves ( the so called hermite - gaussian and laguerre - gaussian modes ) @xcite . as in the present work we study the classical and quantum symmetry properties of the fd system ,",
    "we have considered that , for the sake of completeness , it is also relevant to compute the coherent states in order to complement both points of view .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , we solve the eigenvalue problem for the generic fd system giving the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in polar coordinates . in section  3 , we discuss the spectrum degeneracy and the symmetries of three particular cases : ho , landau , and `` rational '' fd systems .",
    "section  4 is devoted to the analysis of the trajectories ( determined by symmetries ) and the motion ( obtained by ladder functions ) of the classical fd system .",
    "the finite symmetry transformations generated by the constants of motion in the phase space are also examined for these three special cases . in section 5",
    ", we consider the connection of the classical motions and the quantum coherent states .",
    "finally , the last section contains a summary of the original results and contributions of the paper .",
    "the fd system consists in a particle of mass @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 moving in a plane under a harmonic oscillator potential of constant @xmath7 and subject to a constant magnetic field of intensity @xmath8 perpendicular to the plane .",
    "using the symmetric gauge for the vector potential , @xmath9 the quantum fd hamiltonian is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the speed of light , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are momentum operators , with the following notation @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation describing this system in cartesian coordinates",
    "is given by @xmath16 besides the larmor ( or cyclotron ) frequency @xmath17 , there are other relevant frequencies involved here : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the natural frequency of the oscillator , @xmath20 is a fd characteristic frequency and @xmath21 is a ratio of frequencies .",
    "since this system has a geometric rotational symmetry around the @xmath22-axis , it is convenient to write the hamiltonian in polar coordinates @xmath23 and at the same time to change the expression for the eigenfunction as @xmath24 it is also convenient to express the eigenvalue equation in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath25 and parameter @xmath26 , defined as follows : @xmath27 then , from the corresponding eigenvalue equation takes the form @xmath28 \\psi(\\rho , \\varphi ) = \\varepsilon\\ ,   \\psi ( \\rho , \\varphi)\\ , .",
    "\\label{hrho}\\ ] ] in the sequel , we will allow for both positive and negative values of the larmor frequency @xmath17 in order to take into account the two possible signs of the product @xmath29 .",
    "observe that @xmath30 , @xmath21 taking the values @xmath31 for a pure landau system and zero for a pure ho . from ( [ hrho ] )",
    "we see that , apart from the dimensionless energy @xmath26 , the only parameter remaining in the fd equation is just the coefficient @xmath21 , which plays a key role in this system .",
    "as we have foreseen , the hamiltonian ( [ hrho ] ) explicitly commutes with the angular momentum operator @xmath32 , which due to the units used in the equation will be replaced by @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we can look for separated solutions @xmath34 the angular part of wave function must take the form @xmath35 where , in order to have a single valued function , the parameter @xmath36 must be restricted to integer values : @xmath37 the radial part @xmath38 in ( [ sep ] ) must be a square integrable solution of the reduced one - dimensional problem @xmath39r(\\rho ) = \\varepsilon\\ , r(\\rho)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqr}\\ ] ] a similar equation in the variable @xmath25 is well known to appear when the factorization method is applied to the radial oscillator @xcite , except for the presence of the additional term with @xmath21 coefficient . it has been shown in previous references @xcite that this radial hamiltonian can be factorized in two ways by means of two sets of differential operators @xmath40 as follows : @xmath41 these two formulas lead to another expression for @xmath42 in terms of the @xmath43 operators ( excluding @xmath36 ) @xcite : @xmath44    all the previous relationships for radial operators @xmath45 can be translated , with some care , into relations for `` dressed '' operators @xmath46 in both polar coordinates , defined as @xmath47 & & b^- =    \\frac1{2}e^{-i\\,\\varphi } \\left(\\partial_\\rho - \\frac{i\\partial_\\varphi+1/2}{\\rho } + \\rho\\right)\\,,\\qquad   \\ b^+ = ( b^-)^\\dagger\\ , .",

    "the operator @xmath72 has a similar action on the eigenfunctions , but with jumps of @xmath73 units .",
    "since @xmath74 , the contribution of these creation operators to the total energy is different , in general .",
    "we say that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are ladder operators of the fd system with `` different steps '' .",
    "it is well known that in quantum mechanics ladder operators are quite helpful to determine the spectrum of a hamiltonian , as we have just seen , but their classical counterpart may also play a relevant role in order to find the classical trajectories @xcite . the connection between classical ladder functions and quantum ladder operators constitutes a general basis to construct coherent states @xcite , as it will be illustrated later in section  5 .    coming back to the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ habb2 ] ) , and taking into account , they are also eigenfunctions of the angular momentum : @xmath75 a result that is consistent with the commutation rules ( [ lpm ] ) . in order to make explicit the dependence on the angular momentum , one can change the notation of these eigenfunctions as follows : from ( [ eigenl ] )",

    "the notation in terms of @xmath87 has been used in some previous references , but hereafter we adopt @xmath78 with @xmath88 labeling the eigenfunctions .",
    "in this section we will consider three particular cases of the fd system : the isotropic harmonic oscillator , the landau system and , specially , the superintegrable `` rational '' fd system .",
    "first of all , we will recall some known results for the two dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator ( ho ) that can be obtained as a limit of the fd system when the magnetic field @xmath8 goes to zero . in this case , the relevant magnitudes - take the specific values @xmath89 the hamiltonian ( [ habb ] ) has the special form @xmath90 and the eigenvalues ( [ emn ] ) in this case are @xmath91 which correspond to the sum of the spectra of two independent one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "now , let us analyze in some detail the symmetries and degeneracy of the hamiltonian . as can be seen from ( [ emnho ] ) ,",
    "the energy levels are degenerate : the states @xmath78 and @xmath92 have the same energy when @xmath93 .",
    "if this energy level is labeled by @xmath94 , then its degeneracy is @xmath95 .",
    "a set of symmetry operators for this hamiltonian @xmath96 is easily obtained from : @xmath97 the symmetries @xmath62 and @xmath63 fix an eigenfunction state @xmath98 , and the action of the other symmetries @xmath99 on this state will give us the whole degeneracy subspace of constant energy .",
    "we should remark that the angular momentum operator @xmath100 is another symmetry , since according to ( [ l ] ) @xmath101 . in total , there are three independent symmetry operators , for instance @xmath102 , and therefore we can say that this system is superintegrable .",
    "although the four symmetries ( [ symho ] ) are functionally dependent , they are useful to construct the @xmath103 symmetry algebra . indeed , if we introduce the following basis @xmath104 we get a realization of @xmath103 in the form @xmath105 : @xmath106 = \\pm s^\\pm,\\qquad [ s^-,s^+]= -2 s,\\qquad [ { h } , \\cdot \\ ] = 0\\ , . \\label{hoalgebra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we should remark the well known fact that as the superintegrability is realized by second order symmetries , this system is separable in more than one set of coordinates : cartesian , polar and elliptic @xcite .",
    "if the harmonic oscillator term is null ( @xmath107 ) in the fd system , we just have a charged particle in a constant magnetic field , which is the so - called landau system .",
    "the characteristic values of the parameters ( [ coeff])-([param ] ) for this case are @xmath108 the sign of @xmath21 depends on the sign of the product of the charge and the field , @xmath109 . in what follows we adopt the positive sign , @xmath110 , but equivalent considerations apply to the negative one . here",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ habb ] ) takes the special form @xmath111 and the eigenvalues ( [ emn ] ) are independent of @xmath3 : @xmath112 in this case , we can appreciate that the energy levels have infinite degeneracy because the energy does not depend on the second quantum number @xmath3 : the states @xmath113 , with the same @xmath5-value have the same energy , that we called @xmath114 .",
    "the values of @xmath114 are the half odd multiples of the step energy @xmath115 , where @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency , corresponding to the spectrum of a one - dimensional ho .    for landau system",

    "we have seen in the previous subsections that for the special values @xmath124 and @xmath125 , corresponding to the ho and landau limits for , we obtain superintegrable systems .",
    "then , a natural question arises : is the fd system also superintegrable for other values of @xmath21 such that @xmath126 ? to answer this query ,",
    "let us assume that the coefficient @xmath21 is a rational number , in which case we will write @xmath127 where @xmath128 have no common non - trivial integer factors .",

    "the description of the eigenspaces is similar , with some peculiarities that we will comment next .",
    "first of all , let us characterize the nondegenerate energy levels ( eigenspaces of dimension one ) : there are @xmath130 such eigenspaces , each one spanned by one of the eigenfunctions : @xmath131 now , let us consider the degenerate energy levels of dimension @xmath95 .",
