    "one generates a competition dynamics for these two branches in the space of their relative growth probabilities and masses , @xmath49 .",
    "this competition dynamics is symmetrical about a hyperbolic unstable fixed point at @xmath50 ; as the number of particles @xmath46 in the two branches increases , @xmath49 flows to a stable fixed point at either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenvalue of the unstable direction at the central , unstable fixed point is termed @xmath53 , so that for trajectories starting near this fixed point y(n_b ) - n_b^ , [ eq : unstable ] and similarly for @xmath41 .",
    "the hyperbolic nature of the unstable fixed point implies that there is a stable manifold flowing into it , and an unstable manifold flowing out of it and into the stable fixed points .    in order to understand the statistical distribution in @xmath54 space of branch pairs ,",
    "we must understand not only their evolution but also their birth .",
    "i assume that branch pairs are created by microscopic tip - splitting events , which are indifferent to the large scale structure created by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ydot],[eq : xdot ] ) .",
    "thus those branch pairs born in the neighborhood of the unstable fixed point will have a roughly constant initial distribution .",
    "these branch pairs will remain  active \" , i.e. , far from the stable fixed points , until @xmath55 , and thus they will determine the large - scale structure of the cluster . let us suppose that the distance from the unstable fixed point ( or more properly , the stable manifold ) at birth , where @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 , thus defining @xmath58 .",
    "a probability distribution for @xmath58 of @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 a constant ) implies the desired constant distribution near the stable manifold in the @xmath54 plane .",
    "a simple argument then gives @xmath62 @xcite .    introducing a new parameter @xmath63 , the branch competition determines a parameterization @xmath64 , @xmath65 of the unstable manifold ; these functions obey eqs.([eq : ydot],[eq : xdot ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath48 so that @xmath68 ; thus for large @xmath46 @xmath49 refers to the weak member of the branch pair , and @xmath69 to the strong member .",
    "we know the function @xmath47 in two dimensions , but not in higher dimensions . in this case , a useful approximation is given by  model z \" , for which the unstable manifold of the equations of motion is given by a straight line which commences at the unstable fixed point and continues until it reaches @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) @xcite .",
    "it then moves parallel to the @xmath42-axis into the stable fixed point at either @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",

    "model z specifies a one - parameter family of unstable manifolds ; it is possible to determine which of these best approximates dla as a function of spatial dimensionality by a self - consistency argument @xcite .",
    "consider a branch with a constant bifurcation number of @xmath0 whose root has a strahler index of @xmath77 .",
    "we term the strahler _ number _ of this branch to be @xmath77 , the strahler index of its root . for a dla cluster ,",
    "the total number of particles in the cluster @xmath5 will be proportional to the total number of elementary sub - branches @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "inverting this relationship , we find i(n ) - 1 n / b n , [ eq : i ] where the relation is approximate because the strahler number is by definition an integer .",
    "note that we are assuming that the strahler number of a branch is determined uniquely by the number of particles in the branch . in practice",
    ", the strahler number of branches of given size will fluctuate in the ensemble of dla clusters ; little is known about such fluctuations .",
    "the main branch of the cluster is defined by starting at the root and at every branching choosing the stronger of the two sub - branches .",
    "this main branch eventually ends , as do all branches , in an elementary sub - branch tip .",
    "equation ( [ eq : i ] ) implies that n = _ k p_k , [ eq : fund ] where the sum is over all nodes of the main branch , and @xmath80 is the probability that the strahler index of the main branch increases by 1 at the @xmath81th node , as will be the case if the two sub - branches at this node are close enough in size to have the same strahler number .",
