    "the discovery by @xcite of a planet with half the mass of jupiter orbiting the solar - like star 51 pegasi with a period of only @xmath30 shocked the astronomical community .",
    "the existence of such a `` hot jupiter '' ( hj ) defied the prevailing theories of planet formation which had been tailored to explain the architecture of the solar system .",
    "since then , radial velocity ( rv ) surveys for planets orbiting nearby f , g and k main - sequence stars have determined that @xmath31 of these stars host a hj ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    over the last decade",
    "there have been numerous surveys for extra - solar planets following a variety of techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the goal of determining the planet occurrence rate in new regions of parameter space .",
    "a successful technique has been to conduct photometric searches for planets that transit their host stars .",
    "this technique is particularly sensitive to planets on close - in orbits . to date",
    "more than 50 planets have been discovered by this technique , including numerous very hot jupiters ( vhj ) with orbital periods between 1 and 3 days .",
    "@xcite used the four transiting planets discovered at the time by the ogle collaboration @xcite to determine that only @xmath34 of fgk stars host a vhj .",
    "@xcite conducted a thorough analysis of the ogle survey to determine that the frequency of vhjs is @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while @xcite found @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the sweeps survey for transiting planets in the galactic bulge conducted with the hubble space telescope @xcite identified a putative class of ultra - short - period planets , or extremely hot jupiters ( ehj ) with periods less than @xmath39 orbiting stars lighter than @xmath40 .",
    "they conclude that @xmath41 of bulge stars more massive than @xmath42 are orbited by a jupiter - sized planet with a period less than @xmath43 , though they estimate that this fraction is uncertain by a factor of 2 .",
    "note that due to their faintness the majority of the sweeps candidates are unconfirmed with rv follow - up .",
    "in addition to these two surveys , the tres ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) , hat ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , xo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and wasp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys have all discovered planets orbiting relatively bright stars in the galactic field , though to date these surveys have not been used to calculate the planet occurrence frequency .",
    "while photometric surveys of galactic field stars have been quite successful at finding transiting planets over the last few years , it is generally difficult to measure the planet occurrence frequency with these surveys ( for discussions of how this can be done despite the difficulties see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difficulty arises from the uncertainty in the parameters ( mass , radius , metallicity ) of the surveyed stars .",
    "moreover , typical field surveys yield numerous false positives that are often culled in part by eye , these culling procedures are generally difficult to model in determining the detection efficiency of the survey . in contrast to",
    "field surveys , surveys of globular and open star clusters observe a population of stars with parameters that are relatively easy to determine en masse , moreover many of the false positive scenarios are less common for this type of survey .",
    "there has been significant work invested in developing optimum strategies to search for planets in stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "a number of groups have completed transit surveys of open clusters , including the ustaps @xcite , explore - oc @xcite , pisces @xcite , stepss ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter b06 ) and monitor @xcite projects and a survey by @xcite .",
    "there have also been several surveys of globular clusters @xcite .    while to date no confirmed transiting planet has been found in a stellar cluster , many of these surveys have placed limits on the frequency of hot transiting planets , typically as functions of planetary radius as well as period .",
    "the globular cluster surveys have placed the most stringent constraints ; the null result for the core of 47  tucanae by @xcite suggests that the frequency of hj in this environment is at least an order of magnitude less than for the solar neighborhood , while the null result for the outskirts of the same cluster by @xcite is inconsistent with the planet frequency in the solar neighborhood at the @xmath44 level and suggests that the dearth of planets in this globular cluster is due to low metallicity rather than crowding effects .",
    "the open cluster surveys , on the other hand , have typically placed limits on the occurrence frequency that are well above the @xmath45 measured by the rv surveys .",
    "notably b06 conducted a thorough monte carlo simulation of their transit survey of the open cluster ngc 1245 to limit the frequency of ehj , vhj and hj with radii of @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the fundamental limit on the ability of open cluster surveys to place meaningful limits on the occurrence frequency of jupiter - sized planets appears to be due to the relatively small number of stars in an open cluster .",
    "b06 find that for their survey strategy , @xmath50 dwarf stars would have to be observed for at least a month to put a limit of less than @xmath51 on the planet frequency , which is significantly larger than the typical size of an open cluster .",
    "one open cluster that has been a popular target is ngc 6791 .",

    "it has been the target of three transit searches @xcite , the most recent of which found that their null result is inconsistent at the @xmath56 level with the rv hj frequency at high metallicity .",
    "the paucity of stars in open clusters appears to limit their usefulness as probes of the hj frequency ( excluding , perhaps , the result from * ? ? ?",
    "they may , however , be useful for probing smaller planet radii ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in the last several years",

    "one of these planets , gj 436 b , has been discovered to transit its host star @xcite .",
    "little , however , is known about the frequency of these planets .",
    "determining , or placing meaningful limits on this frequency would provide a powerful test of planet formation models .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the frequency of these objects run the gamut from a steep decline in the frequency of hn relative to hj @xcite , except perhaps for m - dwarfs @xcite , to hn being ubiquitous @xcite .    in this paper , the fourth and final in a series",
    ", we present the results of a survey for transiting hot planets as small as neptune in the intermediate age open cluster m37 ( ngc 2099 ) using the mmt .",
    "we were motivated to conduct this transit survey by @xcite who suggested that it may be possible to find neptune - sized planets transiting solar - like stars by surveying an open cluster with a large telescope .",
    "the megacam mosaic imager on the mmt @xcite is an ideal facility for conducting such a survey due to its wide field of view and deep pixel wells that oversample the stellar point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "preliminary observations of ngc 6791 suggested that finding neptune - sized planets was indeed technically feasible using this facility @xcite . using the formalism developed by @xcite we found that m37 is the optimum target for mmt / megacam to maximize the number of stars to which we would be sensitive to neptune - sized planets .",
    "we note that a drawback of this type of survey is that any identified candidates will be quite faint making follow - up rv confirmation difficult . for planets significantly smaller than @xmath58 , false positives where the transiting object is a small star or brown dwarf are no longer applicable . given the depth of the survey very few giants will be included in the sample , and those that are , can easily be rejected based on their colors .",
    "low - precision spectroscopy may be sufficient to rule out various blended binary scenarios .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suppose that for a given small - radius candidate one could make a strong argument that the object is a real planet without obtaining a rv determination of its mass .",
    "also note that similar difficulties will be faced by the _",
    "corot _ and _ kepler _ space missions ( albeit for even smaller planets ) , so our experiment may provide a useful analogy to these missions .",
    "we conducted the survey over twenty nights between december , 2005 and january , 2006 , accumulating more than 4000 quality images of the cluster .",
    "this is easily the largest telescope ever utilized for such a survey . in the first paper in the series (",
    "* paper i ) we describe the observations and data reduction , combine photometric and spectroscopic data to refine estimates for the cluster fundamental parameters ( @xmath59 with overshooting , @xmath60 = + 0.045 \\pm 0.044 $ ] , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , and determine the cluster mass function down to @xmath63 . in the second paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) we analyze the light curves of @xmath64 stars observed by this survey to discover 1430 variable stars . in the third paper (",
    "* paper iii ) we use the light curves to measure the rotation periods of 575 probable cluster members .",
    "this is the largest sample of rotation periods for a cluster older than a few hundred myr , and thus provides a unique window on the late time rotation evolution of low - mass main sequence stars .    in the following section we will summarize our observations and data reduction . in   [ sec : transselect ]",
    "we discuss the pipeline used to remove systematic variations from light curves and identify candidate transiting planets . in ",
    "[ sec : transcand ] we describe the candidate transiting planets identified by this survey , finding no candidates that are probable cluster members . in ",
    "[ sec : deteff ] we conduct monte carlo simulations to determine the transit detection efficiency of our survey . in   [ sec : results ] we present our results on the limit of stars with planets for various planetary radii and orbital periods .",
    "finally , we conclude in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the observations and data reduction procedure were described in detail in papers i and ii , we provide a brief overview here .",
    "the photometric observations consist of @xmath65 photometry for @xmath66 stars , @xmath65 photometry for stars in a field located two degrees from the primary m37 field and at the same galactic latitude , and @xmath67 time - series photometry for @xmath68 stars , all obtained with the megacam instrument @xcite on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "megacam is a @xmath69 mosaic imager consisting of 36 2k@xmath704k , thinned , backside - illuminated ccds that are each read out by two amplifiers .",
    "the mosaic has an unbinned pixel scale of @xmath71 which allows for a well sampled point - spread - function ( psf ) even under the best seeing conditions . to decrease the read - out time we used @xmath72 binning with the gain set so that the pixel sensitivity became non - linear before the analog - to - digital conversion threshold of 65,536 counts .",
    "because of the fine sampling and the relatively deep pixel wells , one can collect @xmath73 photons in @xmath74 seeing from a single star prior to saturation , setting the photon limit on the precision in a single exposure to @xmath75 0.25 mmag .",
    "the primary time - series photometric observations consist of @xmath76 high quality images obtained over twenty four nights ( including eight half nights ) between december 21 , 2005 and january 21 , 2006 .",
    "we obtained light curves for stars with @xmath77 using a reduction pipeline based on the image subtraction technique and software due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curves were passed through the processing and transit detection pipeline that we describe in the following section .",
    "we used the daophot 2 and allstar psf fitting programs and the daogrow program @xcite to obtain the @xmath78 , @xmath67 , and @xmath79 single - epoch photometry .",
    "as described in paper i we also take @xmath80 photometry for stars in the field of this cluster from @xcite , @xmath81 photometry from 2mass @xcite and we transform our @xmath82 photometry to @xmath83 using a transformation based on the @xmath83 photometry from @xcite .    in addition to the photometry , we also obtained high - resolution spectroscopy of 127 stars using the hectochelle multi - fiber , high - dispersion spectrograph @xcite on the mmt .",
    "the spectra were obtained on four separate nights between february 23 , 2007 and march 12 , 2007 and were used to measure @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] , @xmath86 and the radial velocity ( rv ) via cross - correlation against a grid of model stellar spectra computed using atlas 9 and synthe @xcite .",
    "the classification procedure was developed by meibom et al .",
    "( 2008 , in preparation ) , and made use of the _ xcsao _ routine in the iraf _ rvsao _ package @xcite to perform cross - correlation .",
    "we use these spectra to provide stellar parameters and radial velocity measurements for several of the host stars to the candidate transiting planets .",
    "in this section we describe the pipelines used to remove systematic variations from the light curves and select candidate transiting planets .",
    "we use these pipelines first to identify candidates (   [ sec : transcand ] ) and then to calibrate the detection efficiency by conducting transit injection and recovery simulations (   [ sec : deteff ] ) .",
    "the pipeline includes several steps : post - processing the light curves , devising transit selection criteria , and applying the selection criteria to the data to find candidates .",
    "we have devised three distinct pipelines , which we refer to as selection criteria sets 1 - 3 , that differ in the number of post - processing routines applied and the manner in which candidates are selected .",
    "we first discuss the post - processing routines and the precision of the resulting post - processed light curves , we then discuss the selection criteria .",
    "the raw light curves returned from the image subtraction procedure exhibit substantial scatter due to instrumental artifacts as well as astrophysical variations . before searching these light curves for low - amplitude transit signals we must take steps to reduce the time - correlated noise .",
    "this process may reduce the sensitivity to high s / n planets , so for selection criteria set 3 we only apply a limited post - processing routine .",
    "our post - processing pipeline consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "( selection criteria sets 1 - 3 ) we first clip points from each light curve that are more than 5 standard deviations from the mean magnitude .",
    "we perform two iterations of this procedure .",
    "( selection criteria sets 1 - 3 ) for each image @xmath79 , we determine @xmath87 , the fraction of light curves for which image @xmath79 is at least a three sigma outlier",
    ". images with @xmath88 , the cutoff fraction , are removed from all the light curves .",
    "this process is performed independently for each of the 36 chips .",
    "we choose @xmath89 for each chip based on a visual inspection of the histogram of @xmath87 values , we use values that range from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "this process typically removes @xmath92 images from the light curves .",
    "3 .   ( selection criteria sets 1 and 2 only ) we then remove 1 sidereal day , or 0.9972696 day period signals from the light curves .",
    "this is done to remove artifacts due to , for example , rotating diffraction spikes that have a period of exactly 1 sidereal day .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffractionspike ] shows an example of a light curve that exhibits brightenings at a period of 1 sidereal day as diffraction spikes from nearby bright stars sweep over the star .",
    "the diffraction spikes rotate in the image due to the need to rotate the camera with respect to the secondary mirror supports to keep stars on the same pixels throughout the night on the alt - az mmt .",
    "the number , width , depth , and shape of the brightenings seen in the light curves vary from star to star , moreover additional artifacts such as color dependent atmospheric extinction will also give rise to apparent variability with a period of 1 sidereal day .",
    "we remove these signals by binning the light curves in phase , using 200 bins , and then adjusting the points in a bin by an offset so that the average of the bin is equal to the average of the light curve .",
    "( selection criteria sets 1 and 2 only ) as discussed in paper iii , we found that @xmath93 of the probable cluster members that we observed show quasi - periodic variations with amplitudes of @xmath94 and periods ranging from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "these variations are due to the presence of large spots on the surfaces of these relatively young ( @xmath97 ) , rapidly rotating stars . while it may be possible to identify a @xmath94 transit on top of such a signal , it would be increasingly difficult to identify shallower transits without taking steps to remove these variations . using the lomb - scargle algorithm @xcite",
    "we identify the period @xmath98 of the best - fit sine curve to each light curve .",
    "we then fit to the post - step-3 light curve a signal of the form @xmath99 where the @xmath100 and @xmath101 are free parameters , and we calculate @xmath102 , the reduction in @xmath103 after subtracting the best - fit model from the light curve .",
    "note that we adopt the convention that a more negative value of @xmath104 indicates a better fit of the model to the data .",
    "this process increases the sensitivity to shallow transits but decreases the sensitivity to deep transits .",
    "we therefore fit a box - car transit signal to the post - step-3 light curve , without subtracting the sine curve , phased at period @xmath98 using the bls algorithm @xcite and calculate @xmath105 , the reduction in @xmath103 after subtracting the box - car transit model from the light curve .",
    "we subtract equation  [ eqn : harmseries ] from light curves with @xmath106 , i.e. we only apply the correction to light curves for which a harmonic series fits the phased light curve better than a transit signal fits it . to test this technique",
    "we simulate light curves including variability due to spots as well as transits .",
    "we use the @xcite spot model and the @xcite transit model .",
    "figure  [ fig : simspottransit ] compares the results of a full bls search on light curves with deep transits relative to spots and vice versa for the two cases of removing and not removing a harmonic signal before running bls .",
    "we see that removing a harmonic series from light curves with @xmath106 yields bls results that are consistent with the injected transit signal , while not removing the harmonic signal from light curves with @xmath107 yields better results than removing the signal .",
    "( selection criteria sets 1 and 2 only ) finally we attempt to remove any remaining instrumental or weather related trends from the post - step-4 light curves using the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this algorithm linearly decorrelates each light curve against a representative sample of other light curves .",
    "the trend list for each light curve consists of the other stars on the chip with more than @xmath108 points , root - mean - square ( rms ) @xmath109 and that are well outside the photometric radius of the star in question .",
    "there are typically @xmath110 stars in the trend list for each chip .      in figure",
    "[ fig : rmsplot ] we show the rms as a function of magnitude for the stars after stages 2 and 5 in the light curve processing pipeline .",
    "we plot both the point - to - point rms as well as the rms after binning the light curves by @xmath111 hours in time .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the limiting factor for detecting low - amplitude transits around bright stars for many transit surveys is the presence of time - correlated systematic variations in the light curves ( called red noise , noise that is uncorrelated in time will be referred to as white noise ) .",
    "we can estimate the degree of red noise in our light curves by fitting a noise model to the median rms-@xmath67 relation .",
    "we use a model of the form : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the effective number of photo - electrons per image for a source of magnitude @xmath114 with zero - point @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the effective number of photo - electrons per image due to the sky that contaminate a given source and corresponds to a magnitude @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the effective red noise in magnitudes .",
    "note that @xmath115 depends on the aperture and efficiencies of the optics and detector , the exposure time , the atmospheric extinction , and the photometric procedure .",
    "also note that @xmath117 is the magnitude of a source which has a flux equal to that of the total sky background through the effective photometric aperture .",
    "we bin the light curves on time - scales of 5 , 10 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 1440 , 2880 , and 7200 minutes and calculate the median rms-@xmath67 relation for each binning .",
    "we then fit equation  [ eqn : noisemodel ] simultaneously to all ten relations using the free parameters @xmath119 , @xmath117 and @xmath120 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 depend on the time - scale , while @xmath117 is independent of the time - scale .",
    "table  [ tab : rmsmodel ] gives the parameters from the model fit to the median rms-@xmath67 relations .",
    "we also list in table  [ tab : rmsmodel ] the @xmath67-magnitude of a source for which the red noise on a given time - scale is equal to the poisson noise , i.e. @xmath121 as expected , @xmath120 decreases with increasing @xmath122 . at the time - scales relavent for a transit ( 1 - 3 hours )",
    ", the red noise is @xmath123 .",
    "we also note that the values of @xmath119 are consistent with the expected values given the gain of the detector and the measured zero - point for the reference image , assuming the effective exposure time for the `` average '' image in the light curve is @xmath124 .    an alternative method to determine",
    "the degree of red noise in the data is to examine the auto - correlation function of the light curves .",
    "we find that stars fainter than @xmath125 are effectively uncorrelated in time while brighter stars appear to be uncorrelated on time - scales longer than @xmath126 .      to identify the best - fit transit signal in each light curve we use the bls algorithm .",
    "we apply two slight modifications to the algorithm :    1 .   rather than searching over a fixed range of fractional transit width @xmath127 values ( where @xmath128 is the duration of the transit and @xmath98 is the orbital period ) , we allow the @xmath129 range to vary with the trial frequency . we do this by assuming a stellar radius range of @xmath130 to @xmath131 and taking @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the trial frequency in @xmath134 , and assuming that @xmath135 for lower main sequence stars .",
    "while the post - processing described above substantially reduces the systematic variations in the light curves , some variations remain ( see fig .  [ fig : rmsplot ] ) .",
    "these variations give rise to increased power at low frequencies in the bls periodogram of each light curve . as a result",
    ", long period transits should be treated with greater caution than short period transits . to account for this",
    "we subtract a mean filtered periodogram from the raw periodogram for each light curve before selecting the peak frequency . to mean filter the periodogram we replace each point in the periodogram by the mean value of the 200 points closest in frequency to the given point after applying an iterative @xmath136 clipping . testing",
    "this modification on light curves with injected transits shows a very slight improvement ( @xmath137 ) in the fraction of light curves for which the recovered period agrees with the injected period .",
    "we conduct both a high resolution and a low resolution bls search on the light curves .",
    "the low resolution search is needed for the transit recovery simulations (   [ sec : peps ] ) to finish in a reasonable amount of time . for the high resolution search",
    "we examine @xmath138 frequency values over a period range from @xmath139 to @xmath140 days using 200 phase bins at each trial frequency , using @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "for the low resolution search we examine 3072 frequency values over the same period range , using the same number of phase bins . in searching for candidates with the low resolution search we use identical parameters to those used in conducting the transit recovery simulations (   [ sec : peps ] ) .",
    "we use slightly different parameters for possible cluster members and for field stars ( see the selections of these stars in   [ sec : pmem ] and   [ sec : deteff_fieldstars ] ) . for candidate cluster members",
    "we take @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the radius of the star estimated from its photometry assuming that it is a cluster member . for the field",
    "stars we take @xmath146 and @xmath147 .    as discussed by b06 , a simple selection on the signal residue ( equation 5 in * ?",
    "* ) or the signal detection efficiency ( equation 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generally yields a large number of false positive detections that must then be removed by eye .",
    "however , because it is very difficult to accurately include by eye selections in a monte carlo simulation of the transit selection process , it is necessary to devise automatic selection criteria that minimize the number of false positive detections to calculate a robust limit on the frequency of stars with planets .",
    "we discuss the three distinct selection criteria that we have devised in turn .      to devise the first set of selection criteria we inject fake transit signals into the light curves of 1366 stars that lie near the cluster main sequence on a cmd and choose criteria that maximize the selection of high signal - to - noise simulated transits , while minimizing the selection of false positives .",
    "the simulated transits have radii of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath11 , and inclinations of @xmath150 . for each star /",
    "radius we simulate ten transits with periods ranging from @xmath151 to @xmath152 and random phases .",
    "we use the relations between @xmath67-magnitude and mass , and @xmath67-magnitude and radius for the cluster that were determined in paper i to estimate the mass and radius of each star .",
    "the light curves including injected transits are passed through the pipeline described in the previous subsection before running the bls algorithm on them .    to calibrate the selection criteria we first must define the set of injected transits which we consider to be recoverable",
    ", we then adopt selection criteria that maximize the selection of these light curves while minimizing the selection of all other light curves .",
    "note that we use information from the injected transits to define the recoverable sample , while we can not use any of this information when defining the selection criteria .",
    "we consider the transit to be recoverable if @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the reduction in @xmath103 for the best - fit bls model to the light curve with the injected transit , and @xmath155 is for the light curve prior to injecting the transit .",
    "when a light curve satisfies this criterion the best - fit bls model is strongly influenced by the transit signal .",
    "this can happen even if the identified period does not match the injected period , or a harmonic of the injected period , however , in these cases , detailed follow - up may eventually yield the correct period .",
    "note that for transit selection criteria sets 2 and 3 we adopt the more conservative recoverability criterion that the recovered period must match the injected period , or one of its harmonics , to within @xmath156 .",
    "we find that the following selection criteria accurately distinguishes between the recoverable and non - recoverable transits :    1 .",
    "following b06 we use bls to identify both the best - fit transit signal and the best - fit inverse transit signal for each light curve .",
    "for the best - fit transit signal we calculate the signal - to - pink - noise ratio @xcite via : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the depth of the transit , @xmath159 is the number of points in the transit , @xmath160 is the number of distinct transits sampled , @xmath161 is the white noise , and @xmath118 is the red noise at the time - scale of the transit . to calculate the white noise for a light curve",
    "we subtract the best - fit bls model from the light curve and set @xmath161 equal to the standard deviation of the residual . to calculate the red noise we bin the residual light curve in time with a bin - size equal to the duration of the transit and set @xmath118 equal to its standard deviation . note",
    "that while this technique provides a convenient method to determine an individual red and white noise estimate for each light curve , it overestimates the noise for an uncorrelated signal by a factor of @xmath162 .",
    "we select candidates that have @xmath163 .",
    "figure  [ fig : transselectcalib_1 ] shows this selection .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : transselectcalib_1 ] , some of the transit signals that are not expected to be detectable pass the selection from the previous step",
    ". we can further reduce these potential false alarms with negligible loss of detectable transits by the following selection .",

    "what is important is that we apply the same selections and weighting scheme to the transit injection simulations as we do to the actual data and that the post - selection vetting procedure that we apply to the actual data would not reject any of the injected candidates . making a uniform change to the weighting scheme will affect the selection of real candidates and injected transits in the same manner , so the transit detection efficiency measured by the injection simulations will accurately reflect the detection efficiency for the survey .",
