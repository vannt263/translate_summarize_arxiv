    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of polyhedra in the uniform category , thereby fulfilling what seems to be the basic aims of a research program initiated by j.   r.   isbell in the 1950s .",
    "specific terms of his program will be reviewed at the end of this introduction .",
    "this paper is a common sequel to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) and @xcite and will in turn be followed by applications to ( i ) the hilbert ",
    "smith conjecture ; ( ii ) @xmath0 versus @xmath1 of groups and borsuk s problem on embeddability of compact absolute retracts ; ( iii ) sklyarenko s problem on shape invariance of steenrod ",
    "sitnikov homology .",
    "since topological and uniform notions agree on compact spaces ( recall that continuous maps with compact domain are uniformly continuous ) , the theory of uniform polyhedra is not supposed to say anything new about compact polyhedra .",
    "moreover , there is nothing deep about finite - dimensional uniform polyhedra : any reasonable attempt to define them is expected to succeed , and end up with just an equivalent form of what isbell himself once did in a few pages @xcite .",
    "a key difficulty in the infinite - dimensional case can be seen from the following example .",
    "let @xmath2 be the standard @xmath3-simplex in @xmath4 , that is the intersection of the first octant with the hyperplane @xmath5",
    ". then @xmath2 has a constant ( i.e.  independent of @xmath3 ) edge length in euclidean , or @xmath6 , or @xmath7 metric .",
    "however , the distance from the barycenter of @xmath2 ( at @xmath8 ) ) to the barycenter of a facet of @xmath2 ( at @xmath9 ) tends to zero as @xmath10 , in either metric .",
    "thus barycentric subdivision does not work uniformly .",
    "it seems to be a difficult geometric problem whether there exists _ any _ subdivision of simplices into simplices with the property that for some metric ( say @xmath6 , but not necessarily linear in general ) , the cover by the open stars of vertices in the @xmath3th iterate of the subdivision refines the cover @xmath11 by all balls of radius @xmath12 , yet is refined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath10 .",
    "our basic approach is to take a detour and use the `` canonical subdivision '' of @xcite , which when applied to a simplicial complex produces a cubical complex ( versions of this construction are well - known in geometric group theory and in topological combinatorics ) ; each cube is then endowed with the @xmath7 metric .",
    "this yields a combinatorially controlled uniform structure , since when applied to a cubical complex , the canonical subdivision is the obvious silly procedure producing another cubical complex by cutting every @xmath3-cube into @xmath16 of @xmath3-cubes .",
    "this is how we arrive at the uniform geometric realization of a simplicial complex .",
    "while this simple idea already suffices for many practical purposes , it also brings some deep combinatorial complications . at least at a first glance",
    ", the `` cubical '' uniform structure appears to be in an endless conflict with basic pl constructions such as cone , join and mapping cylinder , which are manifestly `` non - cubical '' .",
    "it is this conflict that in a sense is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "our first step towards resolution of the conflict is to further subdivide the cubes into simplices , without introducing new vertices .",
    "these simplices are now asymmetric , but each comes with a natural total order on its vertices , for it is isometric to the `` standard skew @xmath3-simplex '' @xmath17 for some @xmath3 with the @xmath7 metric .",
    "one can now use these asymmetric metric simplices as separate building blocks , making sure their vertex orderings agree whenever they overlap .",
    "thus let us call a partial ordering of the vertices of a simplicial complex _",
    "compatible _ if it induces a total ordering on each simplex , or equivalently if vertices connected by an edge are comparable .",
    "if @xmath18 is a simplicial complex with a compatible partial ordering of vertices , or more generally any @xmath19-set ( = semi - simplicial set in a modern terminology ) , then we can canonically endow every simplex of @xmath18 with the standard skew metric ; as long as there are no loops in the @xmath20-skeleton ( in the case of a @xmath19-set ) , this can be shown to extend to a path metric on the entire @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , this metric is generally plagued by the very same problem that we intended to avoid : it turns out that for each @xmath21 there exists an @xmath3 such that every point of the standard skew @xmath3-simplex is @xmath22-close to some point in its boundary ( see example [ counterexample ] ) .    for this reason",
    "we restrict our attention to flag complexes ( a simplicial complex @xmath18 is called `` flag '' if every subcomplex of @xmath18 isomorphic to the boundary of a @xmath23-simplex , @xmath24 , lies in an actual @xmath23-simplex in @xmath18 ) . a flag simplicial complex with a compatible partial ordering of vertices",
    "will be called a _ preposet_. note that the @xmath20-skeleton of a preposet carries the structure of an acyclic digraph ( = a directed graph with no directed cycles ) .",
    "conversely , the flag complex spanned by an acyclic digraph is a preposet , with vertices partially ordered by the relation : @xmath25 if and only if there exists a directed path from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in the @xmath20-skeleton .",
    "a special case of a preposet is ( the order complex of ) a poset .",
    "thus we arrive at the uniform geometric realization of a poset @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath28 happens to the the poset of all nonempty faces of a simplicial complex @xmath18 , this simply brings us back to the uniform geometric realization of @xmath18 , as discussed above .",
    "all posets and other combinatorial objects will be assumed countable throughout .",
    "we consider three notions of uniform geometric realization of a poset ( in particular , of the poset of nonempty faces of a simplicial or cubical complex ) by a separable metrizable uniform space :    * by constructing an explicit embedding into the unit cube of the functional space @xmath29 ( generalizing a construction of shtanko ",
    "shtogrin @xcite ) ; * by gluing together the standard skew simplices via quotient uniformity ( akin to the traditional geometric realization of a simplicial set via quotient topology ) ; * by gluing together the standard skew simplices via path metric ( like in geometric polyhedral complexes used in geometric group theory ) .",
    "the following follows from theorems [ isometry ] and [ cw ] :    all three notions of geometric realization are equivalent .",
    "the geometric realization of a locally infinite dimensional poset ( even a simplicial complex ) may fail to be complete ; however it is `` homotopy complete '' in the sense that the completion can be instantaneously taken off the remainder by a homotopy ( lemma [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "geometric realization is promoted to a functor from monotone maps between posets to uniformly continuous maps between separable metrizable uniform spaces , which is shown to preserve pullbacks and those pushouts that remain pushouts upon barycentric subdivision ( theorem [ pullback - pushout ] ) .",
    "in particular , the functor respects joins , and mapping cylinders of simplicial maps . here",
    "the join of posets can refer to any of the two well - known distinct notions , and the join and mapping cylinder of metrizable uniform spaces are defined in @xcite .    to include arbitrary pushouts , such as mapping cylinders of general monotone maps",
    ", the geometric realization functor has to be extended to preposets .",
    "let us emphasize that the mapping cylinder fails to be a poset ( and so is only a preposet ) for some monotone maps between posets that arise naturally in practice :    * the diagonal embedding @xmath30 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example [ comb : diagonal ] ) ) ; * approximations to uniformly continuous maps ( see theorem [ monotone approximation ] ) ; * bonding maps between nerves of covers ( see example [ bad bonding map ] and lemma [ 6.1 ] ) .",
    "one can , however , emulate the mapping cylinder of a monotone map between posets by a certain poset , without changing the relative uniform homotopy equivalence class of the geometric realization ( corollary [ hmc ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , preposets do not quite live up to our expectations .",
    "it turns out that there exists a preposet @xmath31 whose geometric realization is not uniformly locally contractible ; worse yet , it contains essential loops of arbitrarily small diameters ( example [ counterexample2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath32 is not uniformly homotopy equivalent to the geometric realization of any poset ( theorem [ ccp - homotopy ] ) .",
    "the geometric realization of every poset @xmath28 is uniformly locally contractible .",
    "this is saying that for each @xmath21 there exists a @xmath33 such that every two @xmath34-close uniformly continuous maps from an arbitrary metric space into @xmath35 are uniformly @xmath22-homotopic with values in @xmath35 ( theorem [ lcu ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a poset @xmath36 whose geometric realization is not a uniform anr ; worse yet , for each @xmath21 it contains an embedded sphere of some dimension that is essential in @xmath37 , but null - homotopic in the @xmath22-neighborhood of @xmath37 in some fixed uniform anr ( example [ counterexample3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 is not uniformly homotopy equivalent to the geometric realization of any _ conditionally complete _ poset ( theorem [ hahn - homotopy ] ) , that is , a poset where every nonempty set has either the least upper bound or no upper bound whatsoever .",
    "conditionally complete posets include ( the posets of nonempty faces of ) simplicial and cubical complexes but exclude for instance ( those of ) some simplicial pseudo - complexes in the sense of hilton  wylie ( where each simplex is embedded , but different simplices may have more than one face in common ) .",
    "fortunately , the geometric realization of a conditionally complete poset does turn out to be a uniform anr ( corollary [ ccp - anr ] ) .",
    "it is the geometric realizations of conditionally complete posets that we call _ uniform polyhedra_.    [ main1 ] uniform polyhedra are uniform anrs .",
    "this is saying that whenever a uniform polyhedron is uniformly embedded as a closed subset of a metrizable uniform space @xmath31 , then it is a uniform retract of some its uniform neighborhood in @xmath31.-lipschitz anrs . ]",
    "theorem [ main1 ] is arguably the hardest result of the paper .",
    "the case of simplicial complexes is somewhat easier ( theorem [ simplicial anr ] ) , and actually reduces to the case of `` cubohedra '' , which was already treated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem [ metr : cubohedron ] ) .",
    "( a cubohedron is a cubical complex that is a subcomplex of the standard cubical lattice in @xmath29 . )",
    "the finite - dimensional simplicial case is equivalent to a result of isbell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.9 ) , taking into account that his geometric realization is uniformly homeomorphic to ours in the case of a finite - dimensional simplicial complex .",
    "simplicial and/or cubical complexes alone do not form a closed theory with respect to a sufficient supply of operations that work uniformly .",
    "the mapping cylinder of a simplicial map , while being a poset , is certainly not a simplicial complex in general .",
    "worse yet , it need not even be a conditionally complete poset ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example [ comb : non - ccp mc ] ) ) .",
    "this is arguably the single most important deficiency of our theory ; but up to uniform homotopy , there is a remarkable workaround .",
    "the _ thickened mapping cylinder _",
    "@xmath38 of a monotone map @xmath39 between posets is a natural subset of the join @xmath40 , related to the graph of @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath42 are conditionally complete , then so is @xmath38 , and up to relative uniform homotopy equivalence of geometric realizations it is the same as the usual mapping cylinder ( theorem [ tmc2 ] ) . using this , we obtain the following result ( theorem [ mather trick ] ) :    if @xmath31 is a uniform anr , then @xmath43 is uniformly homotopy equivalent to a uniform polyhedron .",
    "we also establish what appears to be the ultimate inverse limit representation theorem , and a uniform analogue of hanner s characterization of anrs ( theorems [ inverse limit ] and [ domination ] ) :    [ main2 ] ( a ) every separable metrizable complete uniform space is the limit of an inverse sequence of uniformly continuous maps between geometric realizations of simplicial complexes .",
    "\\(b ) a separable metrizable uniform space is a uniform anr if and only if it is uniformly @xmath22-homotopy dominated by the geometric realization of a simplicial complex for each @xmath21 .",
    "weaker forms of ( a ) and ( b ) , with cubohedra in place of simplicial complexes , are contained in the author s previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary [ metr : hanner2 ] and theorem [ metr : intersection of cubohedra2 ] ) . the present versions , being based on nerves of uniform covers rather than uniform neighborhoods in @xmath29 , have the advantage of greater flexibility , so they can be straightforwardly adapted , for instance , to equivariant contexts .",
    "the compact case of ( a ) is due to freudenthal @xcite , though the basic idea goes back to alexandroff s earlier work ( see remark [ alexandroff ] ) .",
    "the residually finite - dimensional case of ( a ) is equivalent to a result of isbell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma v.33 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.6 ) , ( * ? ? ? * lemma 14 ) ) , though he made a minor mistake in his proof , which can be corrected as we show in the proof of theorem [ inverse limit ] .",
    "the residually finite - dimensional case of the `` only if '' direction in ( b ) is equivalent to another result of isbell @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss how our results address isbell s research program .",
    "one attempted formulation appears in his book `` uniform spaces '' :    comments : ( i ) as stated , the problem is quite vague , but some clarification on what kind of infinite - dimensional uniform complexes are sought here can be inferred from isbell s previous comments in his earlier papers , quoted below .",
    "\\(ii ) the covers by the stars of vertices in iterated _ canonical _ subdivisions do form a basis of the uniformity of our uniform polyhedra ( see theorem [ canonical ] ) .",
    "comments : indeed , with our adjusted uniformity , the theorem is now extended to infinite - dimensional simplicial complexes ( theorem [ simplicial anr ] ) , apart from the completeness .",
    "isbell only considered complete uniform anrs , as well as their non - metrizable generalization , called anrus .",
    "indeed he showed that completeness is forced by including certain non - metrizable spaces in the setup .",
    "however , if one works in the category of metrizable uniform spaces , then there is no such restriction , as noticed independently by g. l. garg and n. t. nhu in the 1970s ( see ( * ? ? ? *  [ metr : uniform - anrs ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting theory of ( possibly non - complete ) uniform anrs has been developed only recently but turns out to be very flexible @xcite .",
    "these uniform anrs are homotopy complete ( i.e.  the completion can be instantaneously taken off the remainder ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem [ metr : uniform anr ] ) , which for all practical purposes makes them just as easily manageable as if they were complete .",
    "comments : indeed , the said results extend to all separable uniform spaces , using our adjusted uniformity on ( countable ) infinite - dimensional simplicial complexes ( corollary [ inverse limit2 ] and theorems [ inverse limit - general ] and [ domination - general ] ) , except that cubical , rather than simplicial , complexes are needed for the generalization of 7.2(i ) .",
    "neither of the results extends to inseparable uniform spaces by the negative solution to isbell s `` research problem @xmath44 '' , obtained independently by j. pelant and e. v. shchepin in 1975 , and clarified recently by a. hohti ( see references in ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  [ metr : finiteness ] ) ) .",
    "hohti s result is that the unit ball of the inseparable space @xmath7 is not point - finite , i.e.  does not have a basis of uniform covers that have a finite multiplicity at each point .",
    "i would like to thank p. m. akhmetiev , n. brodsky , a. n. dranishnikov , j. dydak , s. illman , e. v. shchepin and m. skopenkov for useful discussions .    in what follows we assume some degree of familiarity with ( * ? ? ?",
