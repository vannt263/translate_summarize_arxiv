    "one of the most important physical systems for both classical and quantum mechanics is the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in contrast to the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator that is discussed in most textbooks , the theory of relativistic harmonic oscillator is far from complete .",
    "the reason for this is the complexity of the problem related to the nonlinearity of differential equations of motion for the classical relativistic oscillator .",
    "no wonder that even in the simple case of the massive one - dimensional relativistic oscillator there are problems with identification of periodic solutions to equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the problem of a quantum relativistic harmonic oscillator is usually formulated in one of three different frameworks : the klein - gordon , dirac or salpeter equations .",
    "the first one uses the spinless klein - gordon equation with a lorentz invariant oscillatory potential @xcite .",
    "however , the solutions of that equation are blamed by pathologies such as the appearance of ghost states . the second approach , referred to by moshinsky @xcite as the  dirac oscillator `` and describing spin one - half particles utilizes the dirac equation with an appropriate combination of the scalar , vector and tensor couplings with an external field @xcite .",
    "it can be successively applied to analysis of relativistic symmetries which recently were recognized experimentally in both nuclear and hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approach has no classical relativistic counterpart .",
    "finally , the third approach follows from the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics for a scalar particle and on the quantum level it is based on the spinless salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "the salpeter equation @xcite is a ' ' square root \" of the klein - gordon equation @xcite and can be regarded as its alternative @xcite .",
    "the serious advantages of the salpeter scheme are the lack of problems with probabilistic interpretation on the quantum level as well as the classically well - defined physical content of this theory .",
    "this last framework is frequently used as a phenomenological description of the quark - antiquark - gluon system as a hadron model .",
    "surprisingly , to our best knowledge , the simplest case of the massless relativistic harmonic oscillator was not discussed in the literature . in this work",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the massless relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "in particular we find the exact solutions to the classical hamilton equations as well as to the corresponding quantum salpeter equation and discuss their basic properties .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , by integrating the corresponding hamilton system we identify all kinds of possible motion of the oscillator as well as find its quantative characteristics . for an easy illustration of the dynamics of the relativistic massless harmonic oscillator we also provide a graphical presentation of numerical integration of equations of motion .",
    "section iii is devoted to the quantization of the massless relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "the hamiltonian of the relativistic massless particle subject to the potential @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the position and the momentum of a particle , @xmath4 is the norm of the vector @xmath3 ( so @xmath5 is the kinetic energy of the particle ) , @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath7 is the speed of light .",
    "therefore , the hamilton s equations are @xmath8 we point out that an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) is @xmath9 , that is the length of velocity is @xmath7 as should be for a massless particle .",
    "the familiar integrals of the motion in a central field @xcite are the energy @xmath10 and the angular momentum @xmath11 : @xmath12 as a result of the conservation of the angular momentum @xmath11 the motion is planar and we can restrict , without loss of generality , to the case of a particle moving in the @xmath13 plane . on passing to the polar coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , we obtain from eq .  (",
    "2.2 ) the following system : @xmath18 the integrals of the motion take the form @xmath19 from ( 2.5 ) , ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) we find @xmath20 we point out that the `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' signs correspond to the two possible orientations of the angular momentum .",
    "we choose , without loss of generality , the sign `` @xmath21 '' and @xmath23 throughout this work .",
    "now , from eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) we find that the trajectories should satisfy @xmath24 and we can classify the types of motion as folows .",
    "the first two possibilities refer to @xmath25 .",
    "namely , + 1)for @xmath26 , we get @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "so in this case we have a uniform motion in a circle with the linear speed @xmath29 .",
    "this solution can also be obtained from eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) by demanding @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , it can be easily checked that ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) imply the system @xmath31 from ( 2.11 ) it follows easily that the orthogonality of @xmath2 and @xmath3 refers to the motion of a particle in a circle with radius @xmath32 .",
    "+ 2)for @xmath33 , the path lies entirely within the annulus bounded by the circles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that is we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the real positive solutions of the equation @xmath39 we find after some calculation @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "we now return to eq .",
    ". an immediate consequence of integration of eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) is the the relation @xmath43 in the particular case of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the integral from the right - hand side of ( 2.16 ) can be expressed by means of the elliptic integral of the third kind @xmath47 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , 3.137 , eq .",
    "3 ) , namely we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the negative root of the polynomial from the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) satisfying @xmath50 clearly , eq .  ( 2.17 ) defines @xmath51 as an implicit function of @xmath52 .    furthermore , for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath46 , the implicit equation for the trajectory can be obtained from ( 2.16 ) with the help of the elliptic functions of the third kind @xmath47 and first kind @xmath55 ( see @xcite , 3.137 , eq.4 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath56,\\quad r_0=r_{\\rm max}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the four - dimensional system ( 2.2 ) , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is completely integrable . indeed , it possesses two integrals in involution @xmath10 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the motion between two circles with the radius @xmath37 and @xmath60 can be only quasiperiodic and periodic .",
    "of course the case of the periodic motion refers to a closed path .",
    "this means that an angle @xmath61 given by ( see formula ( 2.17 ) ) @xmath62 should be a rational function of @xmath63 , i.e.  @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are integers .",
    "an example of a periodic motion between two circles is presented in figs 1 and 2 .",
    "it should be noted that the length of momentum ( kinetic energy of the particle @xmath5 ) has maximum at @xmath67 , decreases ( increases ) as @xmath51 approaches @xmath38 ( @xmath37 ) , and for @xmath35 has minimum .",
    "clearly , such behavior of the momentum of a massless particle is consistent with the form of ( 2.6 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as well as extrema of the length of momentum can be expressed as a function of the energy by means of the implicit formulas ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.15 ) .",
    "we finally remark that the case of the uniform motion in a circle discussed earlier [ type 1 ) of the motion ] refers to the condition @xmath68 .",
    "the third type of the motion corresponds to @xmath69 , so we have + 3)@xmath70 . from this inequality",
    "we find @xmath71 . on the other hand , taking into account ( 2.7 ) we find that for @xmath69 the system ( 2.5 ) reduces to @xmath72 where @xmath73 or @xmath74 . therefore a particle motion is uniform in a segment @xmath75 $ ] , more precisely , we have @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and the two signs correspond to two possible directions of motion . assuming that a particle moves in the @xmath78-coordinate line ,",
    "( i.e.  @xmath79 ) , we get @xmath80 where the turning points are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "on setting @xmath83 we can write the trajectory explicitly as @xmath84}c\\left\\{t-\\left(2\\left[\\frac{2t}{t}\\right]+ 1\\right)\\frac{t}{4}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the period of oscillations of a massless particle between the turning points @xmath81 and @xmath86 , and @xmath87 $ ] is the biggest integer in @xmath88 . the trajectory ( 2.23 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "notice that at the turning points the momentum of a massless particle vanishes [ see eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) for @xmath35 ] that is @xmath90 .",
    "the maximum value of momentum @xmath91 is reached for @xmath92 .",
    "the time development of the momentum for @xmath93 and @xmath83 can be written in the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is given by ( 2.23 ) .",
    "the plot of @xmath96 versus @xmath97 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . because the momentum of a massless particle tends to zero as its position approaches the turning point we deal with a `` red shift '' similar to the gravitational one .",
    "it should also be noted that the motion in the segment can be easily obtained from ( 2.11 ) by setting @xmath98 , that is @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parallel or antiparallel and therefore satisfy @xmath99 .",
    "evidently , in the case of the system ( 2.2 ) this condition is equivalent to @xmath69 .",
    "we point out that the motion in a segment corresponds to the condition @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the nonnegative solutions to ( 2.13 ) .",
    "we finally remark that the type of motion is completely determined by the values of the energy @xmath10 and the angular momentum @xmath59 .",
    "namely , using the parametrization of @xmath102 and @xmath38 defined by ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.15 ) we find @xmath103 where @xmath104 refers to the motion in a circle , @xmath105 corresponds to the motion between two circles , and @xmath106 , i.e.  @xmath69 is the condition for the motion in the segment .",
    "in relativistic quantum mechanics the massless harmonic oscillator defined by the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) is described by a massless version of the spinless salpeter equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "therefore the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian @xmath109 takes the form of the pseudodifferential equation @xmath110 performing the fourier transformation @xmath111 we get from ( 3.2 ) the following equation : @xmath112 where @xmath113 . finally , switching over to the spherical",
    "coordinates @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , and making the ansatz @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the spherical functions , we obtain the `` radial equation '' @xmath118 to our best knowledge in the case of @xmath119 the solution of ( 3.6 ) is not known . for @xmath120 the solution to ( 3.6 ) can be expressed by means of the airy function @xmath121 @xcite , namely @xmath122,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is constant .",
    "we point out that @xmath120 was also the case discussed in @xcite , where the recurrence was identified satisfied by coefficients of the formal power series expansion for the solution to the spinless salpeter equation corresponding to the massive relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "clearly , @xmath120 refers to the vanishing angular momentum , therefore we deal in this case with the quantization of the motion of a massless particle in the segment @xmath71 discussed in the previous section corresponding to the condition @xmath69 ( third type of the motion ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath120 the ansatz ( 3.5 ) takes the form @xmath124 demanding that @xmath125 is well defined for @xmath126 we find @xmath127 ( compare @xcite eq .  ( 32.11 ) ) , which leads to @xmath128 .",
    "this quantization condition means that the values of the energy @xmath129 , @xmath130 , are given by zeros of the airy function @xmath131 .",
    "we have @xmath132 using the fact that the functions @xmath133 , @xmath130 , where @xmath134 designates the derivative of the airy function @xmath121 , form an orthonormal basis on the interval @xmath135 @xcite , we find that the normalized solutions ( 3.5 ) to ( 3.4 ) in the hilbert space @xmath136 , with @xmath120 can be written as @xmath137 from ( 3.10 ) and ( 3.3 ) we finally obtain the normalized wave functions such that @xmath138 where @xmath16 .    as in the case of the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator with the probability density different from zero outside the turning points , the probability density @xmath139 does not vanish for @xmath140 , where @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "however , it follows from the numerical calculation that @xmath143 has no maxima for @xmath140 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "furthermore , taking into account all directions of the motion in the segment @xmath144 $ ] ( classical limit does not deal with a single classical orbit but an ansamble of classical orbits @xcite ) and taking into account that the probability of finding a particle in the spherical layer @xmath51 , @xmath145 is inverse proportional to the surface of the sphere with radius @xmath51 , we find that the classical probability density is given by the formula @xmath146 where @xmath101 and @xmath147 is the heaviside step function . clearly , the normalization condition is of the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 . the comparison of the quantum probability density @xmath143 , and the classical one @xmath150 for @xmath151 is shown in fig .  4 . as expected the differences between the quantum and the classical descriptions decrease as the quantum number @xmath66 increases .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now discuss the expectation values of both the kinetic and potential energies . using the identity @xcite @xmath152 ^",
    "2}\\int_0^\\infty x{\\rm ai}^2(x+a_n)dx= -\\frac{2}{3}a_n,\\ ] ] ( 3.10 ) and ( 3.9 ) we get @xmath153 where @xmath154 . hence ,",
    "taking into account the form of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) we find @xmath155 where @xmath156 . we conclude that the virial theorem takes the nonstandard form in the case of the massless relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "more precisely , the roles of the kinetic energy and potential energies are exchanged .",
    "interestingly , we have the same formulas on average kinetic and potential energies in the classical case . indeed , from eq .",
    "( 3.12 ) it follows easily that @xmath157 therefore , by virtue of the first equation of eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) we have @xmath158 we finally write down the following approximate relation obtained numerically : @xmath159 where the formula is exact in the limit @xmath160 .",
    "the approximation in ( 3.19 ) is very good .",
    "the maximal relative error @xmath161 arising in the case with @xmath162 is about 5% and is lesser than 1% for @xmath163 . the fact that the limit @xmath160 when we have the exact equality in ( 3.19 ) , is the classical limit",
    "is confirmed by the classical formula @xmath164 following directly from eq .",
    "in this work we study the relativistic massless harmonic oscillator in both classical and quantum cases .",
    "it seems that the obtained results concerning the classical oscillator are of importance not only from the physical point of view .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( 2.2 ) is one of the simplest examples of a nonlinear hamiltonian system with constant length of velocity . as far as we are aware",
    "such an interesting class of nonlinear dynamical systems was not discussed in the literature . referring to the observations of this work related to the quantum mechanics of the relativistic massless harmonic oscillator we wish to point out that eq .",
    "( 3.11 ) is , to our best knowledge , the first example of the nontrivial exact solution to the salpeter equation .",
    "we also stress the good behavior of the corresponding probability density and expectation values of observables which confirms the correctness of the quantization based on the massless spinless salpeter equation .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the exact formula ( 3.9 ) on the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted that for the salpeter equation only energy bounds were analyzed in the literature so far ( for the massive relativistic harmonic oscillator see ref .",
    "finally , we have obtained the interesting form of the virial theorem for the massless relativistic harmonic oscillator with the exchanged roles of the kinetic and potential energies .",
