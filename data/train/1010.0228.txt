    "finite division rings , also known as * finite semifields * , are nonassociative rings with identity such that the set of nonzero elements is closed under the product ( i.e. , a loop @xcite ) . in case",
    "it has no identity they are known as * presemifields*. these objects have been studied in different contexts : finite geometries ( they coordinatize projective semifield planes @xcite ) , coding theory @xcite , combinatorics and graph theory @xcite .",
    "computational methods have been considered in the study of these objects . among others ,",
    "the classification of finite semifields of orders 16 @xcite , 32 @xcite and , more recently , orders 64 @xcite and 81 @xcite have been obtained with the help of computational tools .",
    "presently , only the cases of orders 128 , 243 and 256 remain to achieve the classification of semifield planes of order 256 or less suggested in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a classification of semifields with * 243 elements * up to isotopy .",
    "it is a computer - assited classification based on the algorithms introduced in @xcite .",
    "in this section we collect some definitions and facts on finite semifields , presemifields and planar functions ( see , for instance @xcite ) . we restrict ourselves to the particular case of order @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic of a finite presemifield @xmath1 with @xmath2 elements is @xmath3 , and @xmath1 is a @xmath4dimensional algebra over @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a semifield , then @xmath5 can be chosen to be contained in its associative - commutative center @xmath6 .",
    "other relevant subsets of a finite semifield are the left , right , and middle nuclei ( @xmath7 ) , and the nucleus @xmath8 which have to be field extensions @xmath9",
    "( @xmath10 ) .",
    "classification of presemifields is usually considered up to _ isotopy _ ( since this corresponds to classification of the corresponding projective planes up to isomorphism ) : if @xmath11 are two presemifields of order @xmath2 , an isotopy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a triple @xmath14 of bijective @xmath15linear maps @xmath16 such that @xmath17 any presemifield is isotopic to a finite semifield .",
    "if @xmath18 $ ] is a @xmath5-basis of a presemifield @xmath1 , then there exists a unique set of constants @xmath19 such that @xmath20 this set of constants is known as * cubical array * or * 3-cube * corresponding to @xmath1 with respect to the basis @xmath21 , and it completely determines the multiplication in @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a presemifield , and @xmath22 ( the symmetric group on the set @xmath23 ) , then the set @xmath24 is the 3-cube of a presemifield .",
    "different choices of bases lead to isotopic presemifields .",
    "up to six projective planes can be constructed from a given finite semifield @xmath1 using the transformations of the group @xmath25 .",
    "so , the classification of finite semifields can be reduced to the classification of the corresponding projective planes up to the action of the group @xmath25 .",
    "finite semifields of order 243 can be constructed from sets of matrices with certain properties @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3 ) .    [ matrices ]",
    "there exists a finite semifield @xmath1 of order @xmath2 if , and only if , there exists a set of @xmath26 matrices ( a * standard basis * of @xmath1 ) @xmath27 ( the set of invertible matrices of size @xmath26 over @xmath28 ) such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath29 is the identity matrix @xmath30 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath31 , for all non - zero tuples @xmath32 , that is , @xmath33 .",
    "the first column of the matrix @xmath34 is the column vector @xmath35 with a @xmath36 in the @xmath37-th position , and @xmath38 everywhere else .",
    "in such a case , the set @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , is the 3-cube corresponding to @xmath1 with respect to the canonical basis of @xmath41 .    if we identify the elements of @xmath5 with the natural numbers @xmath42 , then we can use the following convention to represent a semifield @xmath1 of order @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath43 be one of its standard bases .",
    "since the first column of @xmath34 has always a one in the @xmath37-th position and zeroes elsewhere , we can encode @xmath34 as the natural number @xmath44 , where @xmath45    for a concrete representation of the semifield one can identify the semifield with @xmath41 , and the multiplication with @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath34 is the matrix of left multiplication by the element @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the canonical basis of @xmath41 .",
    "so , the elements of the standard basis are simply coordinate matrices of the linear maps @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the following result shows that , in order to classify finite semifields of order 243 , it is possible to impose for extra conditions on the standard bases .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite semifield of order 243 .",
    "then , there exists an isotope @xmath51 of @xmath1 such that , if @xmath52 is a standard basis of @xmath51 , then @xmath53 has one of the following forms : @xmath54 or @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the companion matrix of the polynomial @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we first show that there exists an element @xmath58 ( i.e. , _ non - scalar _ ) such that the characteristic polynomial of the linear transformation @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "we fix @xmath62 , a @xmath5-basis of @xmath1 , and consider the characteristic polynomial of @xmath63 for a generic element @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath67=\\mathbb{f}_3[\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4,\\lambda_5]$ ] , of degree @xmath37 . consider the system of equations @xmath68 . from the chevalley - warning theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.6 ) it has a nonzero solution , i.e. , there exists a nonzero element @xmath69 such that the characteristic polynomial of @xmath63 is of the claimed form",
    ".    the element @xmath70 can not be @xmath36 or @xmath71 , since the trace of the polynomials @xmath72 and @xmath73 is not zero , and so @xmath70 is non - scalar .",
    "because of @xcite[lemma 5 ] , the characteristic polynomial of @xmath63 has no linear factors , and so it has to be one of the following six polynomials : @xmath74    the first four polynomials are irreducible , and so the set @xmath75 is a @xmath5-basis of @xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) , there on the right , here on the left ) .",
    "this provides a standard basis @xmath76,[l_b],[l_{b^2}],[l_{b*b^2}],[l_{b*(b*b^{(2})}]\\}$ ] where @xmath77 $ ] has one of the forms in equation ( [ primera ] ) ( notice that @xmath1 is an isotope of itself ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the last two polynomials have the following factorizations : @xmath78 because of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5 ) , there exists an isotope @xmath51 of @xmath1 and an element @xmath79 such that its _ minimal function _ is the first factor .",
    "so , because both factors are croprime , we can choose a @xmath5-basis of @xmath51 of the form @xmath80 .",
    "in the corresponding standard basis @xmath81,[l_c],[l_{c^2}],[l_{d}],[l_{c*d}]\\}$ ] , the matrix @xmath82 $ ] has one of the forms in equation ( [ segunda ] ) .",
    "we obtained a complete classification of finite semifields of order 243 with the help of the algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm searchs for standard bases of division algebras with 243 elements , and classify them according to equivalent @xmath25-equivalent semifields .",
    "this is done either for partial or for complete standard bases .",
    "our algorithm was processed in parallel in magerit , a cluster of 1204 nodes eserver bladecenter ( 1036 js20 and 168 js21 , both powerpc 64 bits ) .",
    "each js20 node has two processors ibm powerpc single - core 970fx ( two cores ) with 2.2 ghz , 4 gb of ram and 40 gb of local hard disk . on the other hand ,",
    "each js21 node has two processors ibm powerpc dual - core 970fx ( four cores ) with 2.2 ghz , 8 gb of ram and 80 gb of local hard disk .",
    "it was installed in 2006 and reached the 9th fastest in europe and the 34th in the world ( top 500 : list from november 2006 ) . in may 2008",
    "it was upgraded to reach 16 tflops .",
    "this powerful cluster has allowed us to fill the gap between the commutative and the nonconmutative case .",
    "next we present the results obtained from our classification ( table [ tabla1 ] ) .",
