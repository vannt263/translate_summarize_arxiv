    "the coplanar orbits of the planets around the sun inspired laplace ( 1796 ) to postulate the nebula hypothesis for solar system formation .",
    "the first evidence for these long anticipated protostellar disks was inferred from continuum ir emission at a level well above the stellar black - body spectrum for a large fraction of stars in young clusters ( adams _ et al .",
    "some flattened structures have also been resolved with mm imaging ( beckwith & sargent 1992 ) .",
    "the ir and mm excess emissions are attributed to the reprocessing of stellar light by dust grains .",
    "since these disks are assumed to be the cradle of planet formation , the determination of their structure and evolution has been a central task in the quest to reconstruct the origin of planetary systems .",
    "obtaining accurate models of the thermodynamical structure of protostellar disks is important both from observational and theoretical points of view .",
    "firstly , while spatially resolved observations are possible for disks around nearby stars , the majority of the available data is in the form of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and can only be fully interpreted with a thorough understanding of the underlying disk properties .",
    "secondly , the details of the interaction between the gas and the condensed heavy elements ( in any form from dust grains to planets ) depend sensitively on the temperature and pressure gradient of the gas within the nebula . in short , to understand both observationally _ and _ theoretically the processes associated with planetary formation requires first and foremost a better understanding of the basic disk structure .",
    "this is the task we set out to do in this paper .      in recent years",
    ", multi - wavelength observations have provided a rich data bank of seds for most of the young stellar objects within several nearby clusters ( cf lada _ et al .",
    "detailed numerical modeling in terms of reprocessed stellar irradiation has been successful in reproducing observations ( goldreich & chiang 1997 , bell 1999 , dalessio _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , calvet _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "these analyses show that seds are particularly sensitive to three properties of the disks : 1 ) the nature of the dust grains ( density , size distribution , physical and chemical composition ) , 2 ) the thermal and chemical structure of the gas , and 3 ) the global geometrical structure of the disk such as the inclination , degree of flaring , size , presence / absence of a hole ( dullemond _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) .",
    "current models of dust particles in disks usually assume that they have the same power - law size distribution as that of the interstellar grains ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 , mrn hereafter ) , but with varying upper and lower cutoffs .",
    "this power law of the mrn distribution implies that the total cross sectional area is dominated by the contribution from the smallest grains ( below micron size ) whereas the large grains ( @xmath6 mm ) contain most of the solid - phase mass of heavy elements .",
    "consequently the disk seds in the wavelength range observed by spitzer are most sensitive to the small grains , which are tightly coupled to the gas both thermally and dynamically .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct a set of comprehensive analytical models of the thermodynamical structure of the disks , which can easily be utilized for the statistical analysis of large sed datasets and a more physical interpretation of the planet formation environment .      in parallel with the observational aspects of the study of the disk seds , large theoretical efforts",
    "have recently been deployed toward understanding the growth of small grains as well as the motion of the larger particles ( and small planetesimals ) within the primordial solar nebula ( weidenschilling 1977 , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "the properties of the dust grains have recently been thoroughly studied since evidence for dust growth ( dalessio _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , shuping _",
    "_ 2003 , mccabe _",
    "et al . _ 2003 ) or local ( spatial ) accumulation ( greaves _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) could be the first signs of ongoing planet formation .    while the tiniest dust grains are dynamically very strongly coupled with the gas and largely follow its evolution , intermediate size objects ( `` pebbles '' to `` boulders '' ) have a different intrinsic motion which is sensitively dependent on the structure ( temperature , pressure gradient ) and dynamical nature ( turbulent versus laminar ) of the nebular gas ( morfill & voelk 1984 , supulver & lin 2000 , youdin & chiang , 2004 , ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ) .",
    "it is thought that gas drag causes m - size objects to spiral into the central star within a few hundred orbital periods ( adachi _ et al .",
    "_ 1976 ) , but the ubiquitous presence of planets around at least 10% of all observed stars ( marcy _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) suggests the existence of a reliable , yet still unidentified mechanism for the retention of at least a few percent of the total content of heavy - elements passing through the nebula .",
    "meanwhile , upper limits on this retention efficiency have independently been set through the observed homogeneity of the heavy - element abundances among sun - like stars in older clusters such as the pleiades ( wilden _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , the hyades ( quillen 2002 ) and ic4665 ( shen _ et al .",
    "these studies suggest that the total mass of heavy elements retained by the protostellar disks towards planet formation is at most a few times that contained in a minimum solar nebula ( msn , hereafter ; hayashi _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) .",
    "a self - consistent model of the thermal structure of protostellar disks is essential to understand these rather strongly constrained estimates of the heavy - element retention efficiency during planet formation .",
    "the thermal structure of the gas is determined by a balance between the generation of heat ( through stellar irradiation ( adams _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) and viscous dissipation ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) , its transport ( through radiative diffusion and advective transport ) and finally cooling ( through emission by the gas itself , or more importantly by the dust grains with which the gas is thermally connected ) . in existing analytical models of protostellar disks , the energy source is usually either attributed to viscous dissipation ( lin & papaloizou 1980 , 1985 , ruden & lin 1986 ) or stellar irradiation ( adams _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , chiang & goldreich 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , numerical models of the disks have begun to take both sources into account ( bell 1999 , dalessio et al .",
    "2001 , dullemond & dominik , 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new simple kind of analytical model to calculate the two - dimensional @xmath7 thermal structure of the disk taking into account both energy sources .",
    "the nature of the model enables us to derive analytical formula for all of the disk quantities , and derive scaling relations between the disk properties and the host star properties .",
    "our work is largely inspired from the seminal paper by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) ( cg97 thereafter ) .",
    "as they suggest , most of the stellar radiation is intercepted by a superheated layer of grains which re - emits part of it towards the disk mid plane .",
    "we also adopt an isothermal structure in the optically thin regions above the disk photosphere ( in the case where the mid - plane is optically thick ) and in the marginally opaque or optically thin outer regions of the disk . however , we introduce two major modifications to their work .",
    "firstly , we model the optically thick regions in more detail by considering their non - isothermal structure .",
    "a warmer mid - plane is a natural consequence of heating by viscous dissipation ( in the case of optically thick disks ) combined with down - gradient transport towards the photosphere .",
    "we assume a polytropic structure for the disk stratification in the direction across the mid - plane .",
    "this assumption can be shown to be consistent with some possible heat generation and transport mechanisms , as for instance in the case of viscously heated convectively unstable disks .",
    "it can also naturally be considered an approximation to the true stratification of the disk , with a polytropic index to be chosen from best fits of numerical simulations .",
    "radiative heating by the central star is well - known to be the dominant heat source throughout most disks ; nonetheless for completeness we also consider regions of the disk in which the dominant heating process is through viscous heating , which naturally occurs close to the central star . while this effect is not particularly important for classical t tauri stars ( @xmath8yr ) outward of 1au , the viscously dominated region can extend up to tens of au for much larger mass accretion rates .    secondly ,",
    "while cg97 specifically assumed an msn surface density profile ( @xmath9g/@xmath10 ) we derive instead self - consistent formula between the disk structure and the mass accretion rate . the evolution of the disk",
    "can then be studied for a set of arbitrary initial and boundary conditions if desired . in this paper",
    "we restrict our study to the case of steady accretion ( with a radially constant @xmath11 ) for the sake of simplicity .",
    "while still being an idealized assumption , this is the state towards which accretion disks relax should a constant supply of material be provided near their outer rim .",
    "consequently , it is a better approximation to the disk structure for the inner regions of the disk ( and presumably out to a few hundred au ) ( lin & papaloizou 1980 , 1985 ) than the standard msn power law surface density profile usually used .      the temperature of a typical t tauri disk decreases from over @xmath12k within a fraction of 1au to well below @xmath13k beyond 10au ( see  6 ) . in the low pressure and tenuous environment of protostellar disks , ice grains sublimate between 150k and 170k . the snow line is generally defined to be the location where the gas temperature attains these values ( hayashi _ et al . _ 1985 ) .    as an example of the potential of the new disk model we propose , we present new results on the evolution of the snow line around solar - type t tauri stars",
    "this analysis is much more than an academic exercise , however , since the snow line is thought to play a very important role in the formation of planets .",
    "the presence of a snow line somewhere in the disk separates regions primarily containing refractory silicates from those containing volatile ices .",
    "since the relative abundances of the lighter elements is at least a factor of four larger than that of metals , the supply of grains as planet building materials is much richer beyond the snow line .",
    "the large difference between the typical radial velocity of heavy - elements in condensed form and in gaseous form suggests the possibility of accumulation of material near the snow line ( takeuchi & lin 2005 , ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ) .",
    "the thermal `` anomaly '' in the disk structure caused by the presence of the snow line may also be associated with a flattening of the pressure gradient , which could slow down the radial migration of the larger particles , and further enhance the local accumulation of material . finally , this boundary may separate the domain of terrestrial planet versus gas giant planet formation ( ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "observational evidence for the presence of a snow line in disks around other stars is scarce .",
    "measurements of the location of the snow line in the protosolar nebula have been inferred from the actual water content and suggestions of aqueous alteration in various families of meteorites ( lunine 2005 ) to be between 2.5 and 3 au , within the asteroid belt .",
    "we will show that while our model naturally reproduces its current location , it also predicts large excursions in the position and extent of the snow line during the early stages of the protosolar nebula .",
    "we will discuss the consequences of these findings for the formation and hydration of planets in our solar system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly recapitulate the total energy balance in the disk as a function of the dominant heating and cooling processes . we largely follow the footsteps of cg97 except where explicitly mentioned .",
    "in particular , we use their prescription for the absorption and emission properties of the dust grains , which are both sensitively dependent on the typical wavelength of the photons considered .",
    "this leads to a complex vertical and radial structure of the disk , which is also presented in  2 .    in  3 and  4",
    ", we derive analytical formula for the density and temperature profile in each of the layers for each of the regions considered , and deduce the two - dimensional structure of the disk .",
    "the methodology followed consists in calculating the position of the superheated dust grains as a function of the total optical depth of the disk , deducing the flaring angle of the disk and the associated intercepted stellar flux and equating it with the energy lost through radiation to deduce the thermal structure of the disk .",
    "once obtained , we can then evaluate the mass accretion rate . in the steady - state accretion approximation , the constant mass accretion rate assumed",
    "is then used to calculate the total surface density of the disk , and to deduce the total optical depth which closes the system of equations .",
    "naturally , some of these steps are simplified in the isothermal case , and in the case where the dominant energy source is viscous heating . by following this method ,",
    "we ensure that the disk structure is determined in a self - consistent manner .    in  5",
    ", we estimate analytically the location of various critical radii as a function of the accretion rate and the mass of the central star .",
    "these radii include those separating the radiatively dominated optically thin , marginally opaque , optically thick and finally viscously dominated regions of the disk .",
    "we also obtain a rough estimate of the radial location of the snow line from the radius below which the disk mid - plane temperature exceeds 160k .    in  6 , we apply our prescription to compute the structure of disks with a range of accretion rates around t tauri stars .",
    "we confirm that throughout most of the disk , the flaring angle in a steady - state accretion state increases with radius . in the optically thin region",
    ", we recover the scalings of cg97 for the temperature and scale height profiles , since these are independent of mass accretion rate .",
    "however , our surface density profile falls off with radius much less steeply ( as @xmath5 ) than that assumed for the msn .",
    "this finding is consistent with recent observations of spatially resolved disks ( mundy _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , looney _",
    "et al . 2003 _ ) . in the marginally opaque region",
    ", we also coincidentally recover the scalings of cg97 since our model predicts in this region a surface density profile varying as that of the msn .",
    "the temperature is interestingly found to be significantly larger than in the optically thick region just within : thus we predict the existence of a `` hot ring '' at radii @xmath14 au around classical t tauri stars . in the optically thick regions",
    "our model predicts a significantly flatter disk , with notable consequences on the surface density , photospheric temperature profile and on the position of the snow line .",
    "we deduce three important results : the snow line can be very extended , it has a largely non - monotonic evolution , and can move ( for a solar - type t tauri star ) as far in as the current orbit of venus .    finally , we discuss the assumptions of the model in  7 , as well as its implications for planetary formation and observations of protostellar disks .",
    "our model follows a standard 1 + 1d methodology which implicitly assumes that the disk is thin , with independent vertical ( i.e. normal to the disk plane ) and radial structures .",
    "the dust , which largely governs the thermal structure , is initially assumed to be fully mixed with the gas ; this assumption will be relaxed in future work . in the present context , we adopt a prescription in which @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gas density , @xmath17 is the dust density , and the `` metallicity '' @xmath18 is in principle a slowly varying function of radius and time",
    ". however , note that the magnitude of @xmath18 may change abruptly near transition fronts ( _ eg _ , it decreases by a factor of four as ice grains cross the sublimation line ) .",
    "we will consider the details of the disk structure near the snow line in a follow - up paper .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath17 refers to the heavy - element mass density contained in small particles only ( with settling times which are much larger than the turbulent diffusion time ) ; there could be a significant fraction of `` undetectable '' heavy - elements condensed in larger - size objects , that the model presented here neglects .",
    "the disk has two principal thermal energy sources : radiative heating ( from the central star ) and viscous heating ( from turbulent dissipation associated with momentum transport ) . in intermediate and outer regions of typical disks around t tauri stars ,",
    "radiative heating is by far the largest contribution to the total energy budget and essentially determines the thermal properties of both the grains and the gas in the disk . in optically thick regions , even when radiative heating dominates the _ total _ energy budget , viscous heating plays an important role in maintaining a warmer mid - plane layer , and determines the vertical stratification of the disk .",
    "finally , much closer to the central star , viscous dissipation becomes the main agent in heating the disk .",
    "the effectiveness of the conductive thermal coupling between the gas and the dust is crucial to the determination of the disk structure .",
    "this coupling depends essentially on the wavelengths considered , as well as on the collision time - scale between the dust particles and the gas molecules .",
    "cg97 discussed these processes in their seminal work ; we will not repeat them here .    for computational convenience and reasonable accuracy ,",
    "we assume as they do that the emissivity and opacity of the grains interacting a black - body photon spectrum peaked at temperature @xmath19 are @xmath20 when applying the model to t tauri stars ( see  6 ) , we shall adopt the value @xmath21 although all the formula are given for arbitrary values of @xmath22 . in the same spirit",
    ", we shall also adopt the approximate value of @xmath23@xmath24/g suggested by the work of dalessio _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) .      following the model of cg97",
    ", we identify several layers in a typical disk . the detailed structure of these layers in various disk regions is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig:4zones ] .",
    "the top layer of the disk is referred to as layer 1 where the grains are directly exposed to the stellar photons . since sub - mm size",
    "dust grains are inefficient radiators at ir wavelengths , and dust - gas collisions are too scarce to account for significant cooling , grains in layer 1 are `` super - heated '' to a temperature @xmath25 satisfying roughly @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath28 is the distance from the central star , @xmath25 is the temperature of the superheated dust grains and @xmath29 is their emissivity at that temperature .",
    "the energy balance in equation ( [ eq : balance1 ] ) is valid as long as the grains are directly heated by the central star .",
    "thus , layer 1 extends from the central star outward until a visual optical depth @xmath30 is reached ( dotted line ) .",
    "the temperature of the gas in this layer is difficult to determine without a complete description of the ( dynamical , thermal , and chemical ) interaction between the dust grains , the h@xmath31 molecules , and the coolant molecules ( such as h@xmath32o , and others ) .",
    "however , the gas temperature in layer 1 has relatively little impact on the vertical stratification of the lower regions of the disk , and for simplicity we shall set it to either the temperature near the mid - plane @xmath33 ( in the optically thin case ) , or the effective temperature of the disk @xmath34 ( in the optically thick case ) .",
    "super - heated dust grains re - radiate half of the absorbed flux towards infinity and half towards the disk mid - plane . where this radiation is absorbed depends on the optical depth of the mid - plane layer to re - processed ir photons .",
    "thus we construct layers 2 and 3 where layer 2 is optically thin to the radiation emitted by the superheated dust - grains , while layer 3 is optically thick to it ( note that layer 3 only exists for large enough surface density ) .",
    "the two layers are separated by the dashed line , defined as the position where the optical depth of the grains to the radiation from the superheated layer reaches unity on a path perpendicular to the midplane .    finally",
    ", the heated mid - plane grains re - emit towards infinity at some temperature lower than @xmath25 still .",
    "again , the total outgoing flux depends on the optical depth of the mid - plane to its own emission : if the surface density is large enough , the disk is optically thick to its own emission and we construct a fourth layer ( layer 4 ) delimited by the photosphere ( solid line ) . at the photosphere",
    ", the disk emits a black - body spectrum with temperature @xmath34 which is always lower than @xmath25 .",
    "owing to the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath25 there exist a small difference between the mid - plane layer photosphere ( solid line ) and the edge of layers 2 and 3 ( dashed line ) .",
    "while this difference is usually negligible ( and neglected ) when the inner disk is optically thick , there can exist an intermediate regime ( also discussed by cg97 ) where the mid - plane layer is optically thin to its own radiation but optically thick to the radiation from the superheated layer ; in this case , layer 4 vanishes .",
    "we refer to this region as the _ marginally opaque _ region . when the mid - plane layer is also optically thin to the superheated grains , layer 3 vanishes and we refer to this region as the _ optically thin",
    "note that for even smaller total dust content , the whole disk becomes optically thin to the radiation from the central star .",
    "we do not model this last phase in this paper .",
    "the total energy balance in the various radial regions of the disk is now described in more detail .    _ optically - thin disk regions . _",
    "+ in the low - surface density regions , mostly at large disk radii , the entire mid - plane layer is optically thin to the radiation from the superheated grains as well as to its own emission . in these regions , layers",
    "3 and 4 vanish while layer 2 is preserved .",
    "the grains in the mid - plane ( now layer 2 ) are heated by reprocessed radiation from the superheated grains located on both sides of the disk . as a result ,",
    "both gas and individual dust grains have a temperature @xmath33 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total emitting area - filling factor of superheated grains above @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ the fraction of solid angle covered by grains ) , @xmath33 is the mid - plane temperature ( the gas is assumed to be isothermal in this region ) , and @xmath38 is the corresponding emissivity .",
    "note that the factor of @xmath29 on the lhs accounts for the fact that the grains are inefficient absorbers at ir wavelengths .",
    "we also include the additional factor of 2 accounting for the emission from both layers , which was neglected by cg97 .    _ marginally opaque disk regions . _",
    "+ in an intermediate range of surface density , the mid - plane layer is optically thick to the radiation from the superheated dust grains , but optically thin to its own emission . in this region , the disk is again assumed to be isothermal and layer 4 does not exist .",
    "taking into account for the energy budget for the entire disk , the grain and gas temperature are determined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total area filling factor of grains in the mid - plane layer",
    ".    _ opaque disk regions . _",
    "+ in the limit where the surface density is sufficiently large for the mid - plane layer to be optically thick to its own radiation , @xmath33 can not be directly determined from the stellar flux .",
    "the total energy budget determines instead the effective temperature @xmath34 since the photosphere is reasonably close to the location where the reprocessed radiation emitted by the superheated grains is deposited .",
    "thus @xmath41 where @xmath34 is the temperature ( of both dust and gas ) at the photosphere .",
    "note that this equation assumes that the contribution from viscous heating is negligible , which can be shown to be valid outward of about 1 au for a typical t tauri star .",
    "if we are interested only in regions outward of the snow - line anyway , this approximation is justified .",
    "however , in the innermost region of the disk where viscous dissipation is the dominant heating mechanism the total energy budget becomes @xmath42 instead , where @xmath11 is the local mass accretion rate , and @xmath43 is the local keplerian angular velocity .",
    "this equation relates the total energy generated by viscous dissipation within the disk mid - plane to the emitted flux on both sides of the disk .      for simplicity",
    ", in each of the four regions , we write the mid - plane quantities as @xmath44 where here and all that follows , we set @xmath45 .",
    "this uniquely defines the indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in a manner consistent with the notation of takeuchi & lin ( 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting isothermal disk scale height is therefore obtained as @xmath48 note that @xmath49 corresponds to a flaring disk , whereas @xmath50 corresponds to a self - shadowed disk . in all that follows ,",
    "we assume that the disk is flaring and check this assumption for self - consistency .",
    "the disk surface density profile is @xmath51 for instance , one can set @xmath52 to recover the msn model . for a steadily accreting disk on the other hand",
    "we determine @xmath53 from the requirement that the total mass accretion rate @xmath54 be constant with radius , where we have adopted a standard @xmath55-prescription for the eddy - viscosity @xmath56 with value @xmath57 in that case @xmath58",
    "in the outer regions of the disk , the total surface density of grains is sufficiently low for the disk to be optically thin to its own radiation . in this case ,",
    "layer 4 vanishes .",
    "we assume , as in cg97 , that the gas is isothermal in the direction normal to the plane of the disk and has a temperature @xmath33 .",
    "integrating the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium yields the standard gaussian vertical density distribution for the gas : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the sound speed for a gas at temperature @xmath33 , with mean molecular weight @xmath61 and adiabatic index @xmath62 ; @xmath63 is the gas constant .",
    "when the dust and the gas are fully mixed , the interface @xmath37 between layer 1 and layer 2 ( which can be thought of as the position of the superheated dust layer ) is obtained by solving the equation @xmath64 on a straight path @xmath65 from the central star to the point @xmath66 ( namely , @xmath67 ) . here , @xmath68 is the assumed metallicity @xmath18 normalized to the value used for the determination of @xmath69 , namely 1% .",

    "the disk is flaring , one can approximate this equation using the variant of a stationary phase method ( see appendix ) , which yields the equation ( valid at every radius @xmath28 within the region ) @xmath72 where we have defined @xmath55 as the grazing angle between the incoming radiation from the star and the local stratification : @xmath73    note that this approximation is only strictly valid in the limit where @xmath37 is larger than a few scale heights . by inspection , one can note that the second term on the rhs of equation ( [ eq : tau0 ] ) is negligible within the same limit unless the disk has a sudden jump in gas density or metallicity ( this could occur near a planet - induced gap , or near the successive sublimation zones ) . deferring the study of these transition zones to a later paper , we find that the ratio @xmath74 is otherwise given by @xmath75^{1/2 } \\mbox {    ,    } \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the total visual optical depth from the mid - plane to infinity on a path perpendicular to the disk",

    "however , for other stellar types or for other mass accretion rates , we find that the superheated dust layer position varies widely ( with @xmath87 taking any value between 1 and 6 ) .",
    "once the magnitude of @xmath37 is determined , we need to identify the surface area filling factor @xmath36 of the reprocessing material contained within the superheated layer which is equal to the visual optical depth @xmath89 .",
    "this is done through the integral @xmath90 using the same stationary phase approximation ( see appendix ) , we evaluate the integral to get @xmath91 and combining this with equation ( [ eq : tau0 ] ) yields @xmath92 note that this expression differs from the one suggested by cg97 by a geometrical factor of @xmath93 ; this difference arises in choosing to determine @xmath36 from a path that is perpendicular to the mid - plane rather than perpendicular to the disk stratification .",
    "we prefer the former interpretation as more consistent with the 1 + 1d assumption , although the latter is also acceptable within the degree of approximation associated with this analytical approach .",
    "to compute the radial structure of the disk , we combine equations ( [ eq : tmthin ] ) , ( [ eq : zsh ] ) , and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , and ignore the slow dependence in @xmath28 of @xmath86 .",
    "this derivation yields an equation for @xmath94 for instance , of the general form described and solved in the appendix : @xmath95 which can be integrated to yield equation ( [ eq : hrad ] ) with @xmath96^{-\\frac{1}{7 + 2\\beta } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\cdot & & \\left(\\frac{r_\\star}{1\\mbox{au}}\\right)^{-\\frac{8 + 4\\beta+\\beta^2}{28 + 15\\beta+2\\beta^2 } }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97 if @xmath21 then @xmath98 , with @xmath99 and the flaring angle @xmath100 .",
    "this result is independent of the surface density distribution of the gas , and is similar ( within factors of order unity ) to the expression derived by cg97 .",
    "if we require in addition that the disk be in a state of steady accretion , the surface density distribution can be deduced directly from ( [ eq : sigmarad ] ) , and in that case @xmath101 .",

    "note that in a real disk the temperature `` jump '' would be more diffuse ( as a result of radial thermal and viscous diffusion processes unaccounted for in our 1 + 1d model ) , and could span a radial extent of up to one scale height .",
    "the artificial transitions and associated discontinuities observed in the opaque region , ( from left to right ) between radiatively heated and viscously heated regions , and between the weakly opaque and strongly opaque regions , are mathematical artifact of our crude patching procedure between various asymptotic approximations ( in the former case , for the dominant heating mechanism and in the latter for equation ( [ eq : nasty ] ) ) ; they are represented by dotted vertical lines .",

    "we shall describe in detail a new snow - line model in a following paper .",
    "note that the temperature of the superheated grains reaches 160k at a far greater radius than the marked ( mid - plane ) snow line .",
    "the sublimation of the icy particles in the superheated layer results in a drop in @xmath68 above @xmath37 , but as shown in equation ( [ eq : c(r ) ] ) , this would only have a small effect on the value of @xmath86 .",
    "hence in what follows we ignore the effect of the successive sublimation lines on the structure of the superheated layer .",
    "note that since the outer edge of the disk depends on a number of potentially important factors ( initial radius , self - shadowing in the very optically thin case , total mass , thin - disk approximation , etc ... ) , we have not marked it on the figures presented .",
    "the reader should also bear in mind that the model has less predictive power in regions much beyond 100 au , where the assumptions inherent to steady - state accretion are no longer satisfied ; in these regions , the problem is best solved as an initial value problem .",
    "several notable qualitative features can be readily seen from these t tauri star models and are also found in disks with a wide range of accretion rates , around stars with a wide range of stellar types .",
    "firstly , we observe the presence of a wide , radially isothermal region ( corresponding to the marginally opaque region ) .",
    "although the isothermal nature of this section of the disk was already inferred by cg97 , we find that it also has the remarkable property of being notably hotter than the region immediately within , so that _ the overall photospheric temperature profile is not a monotonically decreasing function of radius_. the hotter temperature is a result of the larger flaring angle of this region compared to the one within , implying that a larger fraction of the stellar flux is absorbed locally .",
    "the presence of a `` hot ring '' could have very interesting consequences , both from an observational point of view and from the point of view of the dynamics of dust grains in the disk .",
    "this is discussed in detail in  [ sec : discuss ] .    secondly , although a more rigorous snow - line model will be needed for more accurate quantitative discussions , it is already apparent in the models presented that the radial extent of the snow line can be considerable when it lies within the optically thick region . by radial extent ,",
    "we imply the region between the radius at which the mid - plane temperature becomes equal to the ice - sublimation temperature , to the radius at which the photospheric temperature reaches the same value .",
    "for example , our results indicate that for a standard accretion rate of @xmath215yr , the snow line extends from 0.4 au ( where @xmath216k ) to 1.35 au ( where @xmath217k ) .",
    "we also note that its extent increases with mass accretion rate ( see also figure [ fig : snow ] ) . on the other hand , for low mass accretion rates ( for a 1@xmath218 , 1@xmath219 t tauri star when @xmath220/yr ) we find that the snow line is located in the optically thin region , with entirely different physical and dynamical characteristics .",
    "the consequence of the transition from an optically thick to an optically thin snow line will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "thirdly , we note that the predicted overall surface density profile is notably shallower than a minimum solar nebula model . only in the marginally opaque region",
    "do we reproduce the standard msn radial power law scaling .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in  7 .",
    "our new disk model is based on that proposed by cg97 , but it contains two significant additions . in our analysis , a polytropic assumption for the disk in optically thick regions enables us to study the largely non - isothermal structure of typical inner disks , while retaining the analytical nature of the mathematical solutions .",
    "we have also incorporated the contribution to heating due to viscous dissipation which necessarily accompanies mass accretion .",
    "in addition , unlike cg97 we do not assume a msn surface density profile .",
    "we can therefore calculate self - consistently all disk quantities as a function of radius assuming steady - state accretion or , as we shall consider in a future investigation , solve numerically for the temporal evolution of the disk as an initial value problem , using the mass accretion rates derived in the model    in this section , we begin by a direct comparison of our model predictions with those of cg97 using their chosen fiducial t tauri star characteristics .",
    "then , we critically discuss the model assumptions and finally , the model predictions in the light of recent observational and theoretical advances .",
    "we compare our model predictions for the temperature profile in a protostellar disk around a @xmath221 , @xmath222 t tauri star to the formula given by cg97 based on their isothermal model .",
    "a straightforward comparison is impossible since the mass accretion rate in their model varies between about @xmath223 to about @xmath224/yr ( assuming the same value of @xmath225 in both models ) , as a result of their assumed surface density profile . on the other hand ,",
    "we need to fix @xmath11 so we choose a fiducial value of @xmath208yr for the purpose of the comparison .",
    "in addition , for this simulation only we change the opacity @xmath69 to the value of 400@xmath24/g used by cg97 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : chiang ] .",
    "we note first that regardless of the inherent difficulty in comparing models with different assumptions , the predictions for the photospheric temperatures do , at a first glance , match fairly well .",
    "this agreement is expected since the only difference in the total energy budget in the optically thick , radiatively heated regions of the disk arises from slightly different predicted flaring angles in the two approaches .",
    "however , beyond this overall match , we note several points of discrepancy .",
    "firstly , the photospheric temperature in the optically thick inner nebula in our model is in fact systematically lower than theirs by 10 - 20% , except very near the central star .",
    "this difference solely arises from the lower flaring angle predicted when heating is taken into account in the disk mid - plane .",
    "secondly , the position of the transition between optically thick and optically thin regions of the disk is closer to the central star in their model than in ours .",
    "this mis - match is caused by our largely different prediction for the surface density profile of the disk , which implies that the outer regions have higher overall mass content ( and optical depth ) than in a standard msn model for the mass accretion rate considered .",
    "finally , note that their isothermal model predicts a snow line located around 1au , while taking into account the non - isothermal nature of the optically thick region implies that the snow line extends as far out as 10 au for this particular t tauri star .",
    "indeed , at 1au for instance our mid - plane temperature is @xmath226k , and exceeds the photospheric temperature by a factor of five .",
    "neglecting this effect can lead to a gross mis - calculation of the position of the snow - line .",
    "the three major assumptions of the proposed model are the following : viscous dissipation is modeled by an ad - hoc @xmath227prescription , the disk stratification is modeled as a polytrope in optically thick regions and finally the dust grains are assumed to be uniformly mixed with the gas at all heights and radii .",
    "turbulent viscous dissipation affects the disk in two ways : it promotes the outward transfer of angular momentum enabling gas accretion onto the central star , and generates heat preferentially in the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "for modest accretion rates , the viscous contribution to the total energy budget of the disk at any particular radius is significant only well within the snow - line .",
    "however , it does does play a role in driving a small temperature gradient between the mid - plane and the photosphere in optically thick regions well outside of the snow - line . by modeling the turbulent viscous dissipation using an @xmath227prescription",
    "we implicitly assume that the mechanism driving turbulence is robust , and independent of position within the disk .",
    "while observations ubiquitously suggest that accretion is an ongoing process in protostellar disks ( hartmann 2001 ) , and that it must be approximately quasi - steady ( otherwise , strong accumulation of matter near specific locations in the disk would be systematically observed ) , the origin of turbulence still remains largely unclear .",
    "turbulent mixing can not be of convective nature only , since heating of the surface layers may suppress convection ( watanabe _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) . mixing by a magneto - rotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1990 ) is difficult to sustain in regions where the ionization fraction of the gas is too low ( the dead - zones ) .",
    "although surface layers of the disk are always potentially subject to the mri since they are exposed to a significant ionizing flux both from cosmic rays and from the central star ( gammie 1996 ) , it is not clear that turbulent motions driven high above the disk are strong enough to sustain a high @xmath227value all the way down to the disk mid plane .",
    "finally , turbulent mixing by a sub - critical instability of the background keplerian shear has also been proposed ( richard & zahn 1999 , dubrulle _",
    "_ 2005 ) , as well as shearing instabilities in the mid - plane layer caused by the sedimentation of the dust particles ( goldreich & ward 1973 , weidenschilling & cuzzi , 1993 garaud & lin 2004 , gomez & ostriker 2005 ) , but while the former has not yet been formally proven to exist , the typical growth rates of the latter may be too long compared with the dynamical timescale to be effective in providing a reliable source of angular momentum mixing .",
    "to complicate matters , it is likely that the intrinsic disk stratification ( both radially and across the mid plane ) may result in largely non - uniform turbulent transport properties .",
    "thus we recognize that the @xmath227 prescription is merely an ad - hoc assumption , necessary to our simplified treatment , and now discuss to which extent the results we obtain are model - dependent .    in our model , the @xmath55-prescription is used to calculate the surface density profile of disks under the assumption of steady - state accretion . consequently , if @xmath55 varies significantly with radius , the radial profiles obtained in the steady - state accretion assumption must be modified accordingly , and the radial scaling laws obtained should be revised entirely .",
    "the generation of heat by viscous dissipation is on the other hand subtly disguised in our model by the assumption of a polytropic stratification for the gas / dust mixture .",
    "thus the model is indirectly dependent on @xmath55 through the polytropic index assumed .",
    "finally , the last questionable assumption of the model involves the fully mixed nature of the dust grains with the gas .",
    "grains are fully suspended in the gas only when their stopping time is much longer than the turnover time of the turbulent eddies ( which no more than one order of magnitude larger than the orbital time ) .",
    "for the smallest grains ( typically , 0.1@xmath61 m ) which are responsible for most of the absorption of the stellar light within the superheated layer , this approximation is largely satisfactory at all radii .",
    "thus we do not expect the position and structure of the superheated layer to be affected by this simplified approximation : significant sedimentation of larger grains ( mm - size ) will leave the superheated layer unaffected . on the other hand , the disappearance of the smallest grains resulting from the _ overall",
    "_ growth may result in a change in @xmath228 by a factor of order unity .",
    "this possibility should be taken into account self - consistently in future models .",
    "with respect to the mid - plane and radial structure , grain growth results in a change in @xmath69 and @xmath22 , which will affect the radial temperature distribution ( and therefore the spectral slope ) in all regions of the disk .",
    "sedimentation does nt affect the re - processing of light in the optically thin regions , but may have a detectable effect on the position of the photosphere ( and therefore the radial profile ) in the optically thin regions .      _ disk geometry _ : + as in ch97 , we find that the stellar radiation is primarily absorbed by a flaring layer ( @xmath229 ) of superheated grains in the radiatively heated regions , including in the newly studied case of optically thick , non isothermal disks .",
    "regions where viscous dissipation is the principal source of energy are , on the other hand , found to be non - flaring ( @xmath230 ) although their overall geometry is very close to flat .",
    "from the central regions to the outer regions of the disk we find that the flaring angle gradually increases outward .",
    "the viscously heated , and radiatively heated , strongly opaque regions of the disk are close to a flat geometry ( @xmath231 ) , with the temperature index @xmath47 increasing from @xmath232 to @xmath233 ( corresponding to @xmath234 and @xmath235 respectively ) . thus we note that a flat disk geometry does not necessarily imply any grain sedimentation , and it can also straightforwardly be reproduced by a appropriately modeled optically thick disk .",
    "the marginally opaque transition region ( from optically thick to optically thin disks ) is accompanied by a very sharp , local increase in the flaring angle with @xmath236 .",
    "this transition is therefore accompanied by a sharp local increase in the temperature , reaching values up to 40% larger than in the optically thick region immediately within .",
    "self - consistent calculations of the height of the superheated layer in the optically thin regions shows that the flaring geometry persists all the way out to several hundred aus , albeit with a slightly smaller flaring angle ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "self - shadowing of the outermost regions may occur , as discussed earlier , when @xmath55 exceeds a fraction of the total visual optical depth , unless other mechanisms truncating the disk occur first .",
    "this sharp cut off in the reprocessed radiation could appear as an outer edge of the disk .",
    "_ disk seds and surface density distribution _ + the mir and fir photons are emitted by both grains at photosphere of the inner opaque regions where @xmath238k and by the superheated grains with @xmath239k at much larger radii . around classical t tauri stars",
    "where @xmath240 yr@xmath2 , the radii where @xmath34 and @xmath193 decrease below 200k are @xmath241 and 30 au respectively .",
    "around weak - line t tauri with @xmath242 yr@xmath2 the radii where they fall below @xmath243 are 0.07 and 30 au respectively .",
    "although the area filling factor @xmath244 of the superheated grains with @xmath239k is well below unity , their total emitting area is much larger than the opaque inner region with @xmath238k .",
    "consequently , the superheated grains contribute to a large fraction of the mir and fir radiation and the sed in this wavelength range is essentially flat ( cg97 ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath34 of the opaque regions is generally too high for the emerging photons to contribute significantly to the sub - mm radiation .",
    "these photons are emitted by much - cooler and much - larger ( mm to cm size ) grains near the mid plane of marginally- transparent and optically - thin regions in the outer disk .",
    "at very large disk radii , the superheated grains also contributes to these long wave radiation .",
    "a robust feature of our model is the prediction of an overall disk surface density much shallower than the standard msn ; this prediction is associated with the assumption of steady - state accretion .",
    "more precisely , we find that the opaque inner disk regions satisfy roughly @xmath245 and @xmath246 in the viscously and radiatively heated regions respectively . the marginally opaque disk regions , however , are radially isothermal which implies a surface density profile varying as the msn profile ( hayashi _ et al_. 1985 ) under the steady - state accretion approximation .",
    "this is particularly interesting since these intermediate regions can have a large radial extent ( between 100 - 200 au and 4 - 7 au respectively as @xmath11 decreases from @xmath247/yr to @xmath248/yr ) . finally , in the optically thin regions we find @xmath249 . around some t tauri stars ,",
    "the outer regions have been resolved by mm interferometer observations .",
    "our prediction on the surface density distribution in this region is very similar to that inferred from the mm maps of resolved protostellar disks around t tauri stars ( mundy _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , looney _",
    "the disk mass determination based on the assumption that these regions are optically thin ( beckwith & sargent 1991 ) is fully justified .",
    "_ snow line position , structure and history _ + as seen in figure [ fig : ttauri - dotm ] , the snow line around @xmath250 classical t tauri stars shrinks from a few au to about 0.6au as @xmath251 decreases from @xmath252 to @xmath253yr@xmath2 , then re - expands to slightly over 2.2 au .",
    "this interesting non - monotonous variation of the snow line position with mass accretion rate ( and therefore with time ) is illustrated in figure [ fig : snow ] .",
    "for relatively high values of the mass accretion rate , we confirm that the snow line is located in the strongly opaque region , and therefore has a significant radial extent . for @xmath254 y@xmath2",
    "the snow line is located near the present - day radius of jupiter ; it may have been critical in promoting the emergence of the first gas giant planet at this location in the solar system ( ida & lin 2004 ) .    during the final stage of disk depletion",

    "this transition occurs when @xmath11 drops below @xmath257 yr@xmath2 .",
    "note that the sharpness of the transition observed in fig [ fig : snow ] may be an artefact of the simplistic snow line model used here ; we will study the physics of the snow line and the consequences of the transition from optically thick to optically thick in more detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "most interestingly , we find that the position of the snow line drops down to a radius of about 0.6 au before expanding out again .",
    "this location is comparable to the inner boundary of the habitable zone around solar - type stars ( kasting _ et al .",
    "the discrepancy between our results and those obtained by lecar _",
    "( 2006 ) for instance arises from our self - consistent calculation of the flaring angle in the optically thick regions of the disk , combined with the assumption of steady - state accretion .",
    "the consequences of this finding are potentially far reaching .",
    "when the disk mass accretion rate has declined to about @xmath258 yr@xmath2 , the snow line crosses the earth s orbit and steadily continues shrinking ; at this point , the local total surface density of the disk is about 400 g/@xmath24 , so that in a ring of with a width @xmath259 around the earth s orbit one may find about @xmath260 of condensed water in the form of icy particles .",
    "about half this amount in ices is also found around the orbit of venus when the snow line crosses its orbit .",
    "this amount largely exceeds the current total water content of earth and venus , and could provide an alternative explanation for their hydration : the possibility of a late stage accretion of ice grains onto large protoplanetary embryos _ in situ _ has the main advantage of providing a simple deterministic explanation for the measured d / h abundance ratio ( lunine 2005 ) of the oceans water .    finally , we also note that t tauri stars younger than 1 myr undergo fu orionis outbursts ( herbig 1977 , hartmann & keyon 1985 ) . during these outbursts , the central luminosity increases above @xmath261",
    "( hartmann 2001 ) and the snow line can near - instantly expand well beyond 100au , then retreat back to its initial position in a short period of time ( @xmath262 100 yr ) .",
    "this episodic relocation of the snow line will clearly be very disruptive to the growth of any icy body in most regions of the disk within the first @xmath82 yr of the disk s evolution .",
    "this phenomenon may be observable through the coexistence of water vapor and ice at large radii in very young protostellar disks .",
