    "we observe a striking response to temperature changes leading to negative thermal expansion and tuneable porosity of the liposome networks .",
    "these counterintuitive effects emerge from the interplay between the temperature - dependent mechanical properties of the liposomes and the mobility of the dna linkers , and can not be replicated with stiffer materials , including solid particles and oil droplets .",
    "the latter , because of the high interfacial tension as compared to the strength of dna - mediated adhesion , are nearly undeformable .",
    "we focus on the quantitative understanding of the morphological changes and interactions in pairs of identical liposomes and rationalise our experimental observations by means of a detailed model that , with a single fitting parameter , is capable of predicting the temperature dependence of all the morphological observables as well as the fraction of formed dna bonds .",
