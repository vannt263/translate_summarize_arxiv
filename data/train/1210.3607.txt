    "now suppose that @xmath21 is a symmetrically reciprocal matrix ( _ sr_-matrix ) , so that @xmath272 for all @xmath107 .",
    "such matrices arise as a result of pairwise comparisons in the analytic hierarchy process ( ahp ) , which is a widely used framework for decision making . the typical interpretation is that @xmath14 indicates the relative strength ( or score ) of option @xmath4 to option @xmath8 .",
    "a central question in the ahp is to determine a weight vector @xmath35 in which @xmath273 represents the weight given to option @xmath4 .",
    "saaty @xcite suggested to take @xmath35 to be the perron vector of @xmath21 .",
    "elsner and van den driessche @xcite suggested selecting @xmath35 from the set of vectors , including the max - algebraic eigenvector , that minimises the functional @xmath274 recall that the set of vectors that minimise ( [ eq : errf ] ) is the subeigencone of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath160 for an _",
    "sr_-matrix @xmath21 @xcite .    in this context , a spanning tree in @xmath275 rooted at @xmath4 represents an accumulation of _ relative _ scores with respect to all other options in @xmath276 . with this in mind , the vector of maximal rst weights for @xmath277 is a reasonable choice of ranking vector . from proposition",
    "[ pro : irred ] , we know that @xmath35 must solve the generalised max - eigenvector equation @xmath278 where @xmath3 is diagonal and satisfies @xmath279 it is worth noting that such a @xmath35 does not minimise the maximal relative error functional in ( [ eq : errf ] ) and may give different rankings to the schemes considered there .",
    "on the other hand , it has the advantage that the maximal rst vector is unique , while the optimisation problem studied in these earlier papers may give rise to multiple rankings .",
    "another scenario in which these results could be applied is as follows .",
    "suppose we have a set of @xmath280 `` judges '' and @xmath281 `` competitors '' .",
    "each judge is asked to give the competitors a score between 0 and 1 with the highest ranked competitor scoring a @xmath54 and the others scored accordingly . moreover ,",
    "each competitor is asked to score the judges in the same way .",
    "the judges scores will generate a matrix @xmath282 with a row for each judge , while the competitors scores will generate a matrix @xmath283 with a row for each competitor s scores .",
    "consider now the matrix @xmath284 .",
    "for @xmath285 , consider the entry @xmath286 .",
    "each product @xmath287 can be viewed as an indirect score given by competitor @xmath77 to competitor @xmath288 via judge @xmath159 .",
    "thus the entry @xmath289 is the maximal such score over all judges .",
    "it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath290 will be max - stochastic . the maximal rst vector @xmath35 associated with @xmath291 can be used to rank the competitors and theorem  [ thm : maxtreethm ] shows that @xmath35 is a max eigenvector of @xmath292 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the matrix @xmath293 .",
    "we have shown that the markov chain tree theorem extends to the max algebra .",
    "we have also shown that this fact follows from the classical result via dequantisation .",
    "we have related the maximal rst vector to the entries of the kleene star and briefly discussed some possible applications of these results to ahp and ranking ."
