    "at the distance of @xmath5 kpc , m31 is the normal , bright spiral galaxy closest to us .",

    "the close proximity enables us to obtain very detailed observations in the x  ray band also with current missions , and we can therefore study the properties of its x  ray emitting evolved stellar population .",
    "this gives us the opportunity of better understanding analogous sources in our own galaxy .",
    "there are several advantages of a detailed study of m31 over our own galaxy , in spite of the fact that sources are more distant than galactic objects , and therefore require higher sensitivity and better spatial resolution : the distance to m31 is well known , so that the luminosities of its sources can be accurately calculated ; the location of individual sources , @xmath7 whether in the bulge or in the disk of the galaxy , can be more easily assessed so that the association with the stellar population is more reliable ; the much lower line  of  sight column density ( n@xmath8 @xmath0 7 @xmath9@xmath10 in our galaxy ) allows a more comprehensive investigation of the spectral properties over a larger energy range than it is possible in objects in the plane of our own galaxy .",
    "moreover , due to its relatively favorable orientation , absorption internal to the m31 disk is also reduced relative to that affecting sources in the milky way disk .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]",

    "2 .   given the possible association with more than 1 rosat ( @xmath4 ) source , the flux of all is reported for comparison with the  flux .",
    "source at the edge of the field 4 .",
    "flux of source #  9 is in 4@xmath11 radius circle ( see text ) .    to search for long term variability we compared the flux measured at different epochs by different instruments .",
    "table  [ flux ] shows the comparison between mecs fluxes and the average fluxes obtained with @xmath4 and rosat for the different sources detected with .",
    "we have converted the 0.2 - 4 kev fluxes given in ft , s97 and p93 to a 2 - 10 kev flux assuming a @xmath12 kev bremsstrahlung model . when more than 1 rosat ( @xmath4 ) source is included in the count extraction region , the sum of all fluxes",
    "is given in table  [ flux ] .",
    "the adopted count - to - flux conversion of table  [ spectramecs ] are expected to be reasonably accurate .",
    "however , the flux of sources at large off - axis angles or near the strongback could be under / overestimated , since the arf ( which properly models the expected spectral distribution of the photons , as already discussed ) does not take into account distortions at large off - axis angles and does not properly correct for the strongback absorption .",
    "this could lead to an overestimate of the flux for sources near the strongback ( although probably @xmath13 40% in the worst case , and our sources are only partially affected by the strongback ) , and to an underestimate for very off - axis sources , in particular as a result of the small area that we had to use due to field crowdedness .",
    "in fact , the flux for source #  9 derived from a 4@xmath11 radius circle is higher by @xmath14% than that obtained from the @xmath15 circle reported in table  [ spectramecs ] .",
    "unfortunately , this is the only source at large off - axis angles for which a larger area can be used to test this .",
    "all other sources ( namely #  8 , #  10 and #  11 ) are either close to the strongback or to other  sources .",
    "the comparison in table  [ flux ] indicate that  fluxes are systematically slightly higher than either rosat or @xmath4 fluxes .",
    "however , there appears to be a roughly constant factor of @xmath16 between  and @xmath4 fluxes , regardless of source position in the field , which would point to a further systematic off - set , rather than a flux increase for all sources .",
    "in fact , if we consider that most of the sources are close to or embedded in the hi disk , and that absorption effects are much more important in the softer energy bands of @xmath4 and even more of rosat , it is likely that neglect of the internal absorption in m31 in the counts - to - flux conversion in the softer enegy bands ( both ft and s97 have assumed only absorption equivalent to the galactic line - of - sight value ) accounts for most of this off - set .",
    "three sources however deviate from this trend : source #  9 is much stronger in the  data of dec .",
    "97 than in previous observations , and sources #  6 and ( less drammatically ) #  7 are stronger than measured by @xmath4 ( rosat fluxes are consistent with a increase since then ) .",
    "their location in m31 indicates that absorption could be severe if they are in or behind the hi ring .",
    "however , this would not be sufficient to reconcile the different fluxes .",
    "moreover , only the spectrum of source 9 is significantly different from the one adopted in the flux - to - counts conversion , and again this is not enough to bring @xmath4 or rosat fluxes to the level .",
    "it is therefore likely that these sources have varied in the @xmath17 years elapsed between observations .",
    "a better assessment of the amplitude variation will however require a more precise knowledge of the spectrum , which will be possible with future , broad band observations such as those available with the axaf or xmm missions .",
    "all m31 source detected with   have high x  ray luminosity ( l@xmath18 erg s@xmath19 in the 2 - 10 kev band ) , and have been identified mostly with globular clusters .",
    "this suggests that they are most likely low mass x - ray binary sources .",
    "although the quality of the data does not allow us a precise assessment of their spectral properties , we find that most of the high luminosity sources have a similar spectrum , that can be described with a single temperature component with kt@xmath20 kev .",
    "two sources however have significantly different spectral properties : source #  3 and #  9 , both identified with globular clusters , have a much harder spectrum , with @xmath21 .",
    "although detailed observations of high signal - to - noise galactic sources might require more complex models , the spectrum of a lmxb , with a weak - field neutron star as the accreting object , is reasonably well approximated by a bremsstrahlung model from a few to @xmath22 kev ( see van paradijs 1998 and references therein ) . in globular cluster sources , where lmxb are expected , a range in temperatures , from @xmath23 kev has been found from archival exosat data ( callanan et al .",
    "this is the same range of temperatures we find for the globular cluster system in m31 , with the possible exception of one source ( #  9 ) .",
    "therefore it appears that the spectral properties of the globular clusters in m31 and in our galaxy in the @xmath24 kev band do not differ significantly . to better model the low energy data , that can not be reproduced simply by the effect of absorption , callanan et al",
    ". also include a blackbody component with kt @xmath25 kev .",
    "as shown by table  [ lecs+mecs ] , data do not require additional components , since a single p or b model plus absorption is adequate in most cases .",
    "the addition of a blackbody component would in some cases reduce the requirement of high absorption , but without improving the quality of the spectral fit and without reconciling the n@xmath8 to the line - of - sight value ( for example , the absorption for source #  7 is reduced to 2820 @xmath10 , if a @xmath26 kev bb is added to the p model , see table  [ lecs+mecs ] ) .    the sample examined by callanan et al .",
    "spans a rather large range in x  ray luminosities ( from 5@xmath27 to 5@xmath28 erg s@xmath19 ) , while the globular cluster sources in m31 are all bright sources ( l@xmath29 erg s@xmath19 ) .",
    "all of the sources studied by callanan et al . have metallicities lower than 1/2 solar , while the globular clusters have metallicities up to @xmath30 ( huchra et al .",
    "it has been recently proposed by irwin & bregman ( 1999 ) that the soft x  ray properties of the globular cluster systems in m31 depend on metallicity , in the sense that the spectra become softer with increasing metallicity .",
    "no such trend was found in the galactic globular clusters , however irwin & bregman suggest this is due to the lower average metallicity considered .",
    "like for the galactic clusters , no trend is observed between the 2 - 10 kev spectra of our sources and metallicity : the same best fit temperature is derived for clusters at the opposite end of the metallicity range .",
    "although the sample is limited ( more so than the rosat sample studied by irwin & bregman ) and spans a somewhat narrower range in metallicity ( they have 1 object with higher metallicity ) , we can not extend their suggestion to the harder energies .",
    "we have also considered the softer energy band , where however the sample is further reduced both in numbers ( 3 objects ) and in metallicity ( all metal poor ) . as discussed above",
    ", the data do not require a second component in the fit .",
    "while this is probably due to the data quality , it could again be interpreted in the framework of metallicity : we have lecs data only for the lower metallicity objects , and if the requirement of a second component is not as stringent for these objects , our 1-component fits are consistent with the low metallicity globular cluster population of our galaxy .",
    "we have also compared the best fit spectral parameters derived from rosat and data .",
    "the comparison is not straightforward , given the almost completely separate wavebands considered , also in view of the supposedly complex spectrum of these sources .",
    "nontheless , we find that the results are in good , though loose , agreement .",
    "the higher than galactic absorption required by the fit of sources 2 and 7 is also detected in the rosat data ( rosat source 73 and 205 respectively have the highest values of n@xmath8 in the irwin & bregman sample ) .",
    "there is a much looser agreement with the temperatures ; however , the determination of temperatures such as those measured in these sources is very hard with rosat data .",
    "we notice however that the spectra of irwin & bregman can be divided in two classes : hard ( kt @xmath31 3 kev ) and soft ( kt @xmath32 ) .",
    "while we do not have any evidence for the soft spectra , it is possible that they represent the soft component that we do not measure in our data , either for lack of lecs data ( source #  8) or possibly because of confusion in the presence of high absorption ( source #  2 ) . given the extremely limited size of the sample , and the limited quality of our data , we have to wait for future observations of m31 to really better measure the spectral properties of its globular cluster population in the entire @xmath33 kev band .",
    "source 9 has a much harder spectrum than all other sources in m31 , and in particular it is harder than all other globular cluster sources .",
    "hard spectra such as these are more typical of binary systems containing a strong - field neutron star , or black hole candidates .",
    "this is a rather unusual spectrum for a globular cluster source , as none are known in our own galaxy .",
    "we therefore suggest two possible interpretations : either the surce has been incorrectly associated with a globular cluster , or this is the first evidence of black hole formation in a globular cluster .",
    "while this latter would be a more intriguing possibility , we can not at the present time rule out a mis - identification .",
    "a precise determination of the x - ray position of this very hard source will be possible with future imaging telescopes and will allow us to confirm its identification with the optical counterpart .",
    "we have measured the spectrum of the m31 bulge as a whole .",
    "we find that a single temperature thermal model can represent well the lecs data at high energies up to @xmath34 kev , but fails to account for excess emission at low energies .",
    "moreover , if the detection at @xmath35 kev obtained with the pds is associated with the bulge , a more complex model is needed also at high energies . unfortunately , the data quality does not allow us to uniquely identify the different components required to fit the entire @xmath36 kev range of data .    _ high energy emission _ : until imaging data at high energies are available , the association between the emission at @xmath37 kev and the bulge can not be confirmed . when a combination of power law and blackbody ( also used for the galactic lmxb ) is fitted to the lecs data of the bulge , the pds data appear as the extension at higher energies of the bulge emission , indicating that the association is at least likely .",
    "however , we can not unambiguously determine the spectral models to describe the data : a power law plus black body is sufficient to model the lecs + pds data , but the bb+diskbb+p model , with the parameters used for ginga data , could also describe data .    _",
    "soft excess _ : within the lecs data , we can model equally well the soft component with either a @xmath38 kev black body or a @xmath39 kev @xmath40 model .",
    "however , when the power law + black body is used at high energies , the black body might be slightly preferred .",
    "we have tried to understand whether the model used for the bulge is consistent with that of galactic sources .",
    "the much better quality spectra that can be obtained for these latter complicates the comparison , since more detailed complex models are needed to fit the data . on the other hand , the much higher typical line - of - sight column densities of lmxb in the disk of our galaxy ( with the exception of those nearby )",
    "prevent a proper study of their soft spectra .",
    "two of the most nearby galactic lmxb s ( hercules x-1 and 4u 1626 - 67 ) have been recently observed both with asca and with .",
    "their spectrum needs at least two components ; in either case a black body at low energies and a power law have been used .",
    "residual excess emission around @xmath411 kev has been modeled with fe lines in hercules x-1 ( oosterbroeck et al .",
    "1997 ) and with o and ne lines in 4u 1626 - 67 ( owens et al .",
    "the lmxb in globular clusters also require a two component model , composed of a black body and bremsstrahlung or power law component ( callanan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the requirement of two black bodies in the m31 data is due to the need of accounting for both excess at low energies and for the high energy emission , while retaining enough curvature in the spectral shape to be consistent with the energy distribution of the photons .",
    "the temperature of the softer black body component ( @xmath0 0.15 kev , see table  [ bulge ] ) is intermediate between her x-1 and 4u 1626 - 67 ( kt @xmath0 0.1 and 0.3 kev respectively , oosterbroeck et al .",
    "1997 ; owens et al .",
    "1997 ) , and represents a similar percentage of the total 0.1 - 10 kev flux .",
    "however , it gives a much smaller contribution if softer energy bands are considered ( @xmath42 , in the rosat band , the unabsorbed flux due to the black body is 30% of the total flux , compared to @xmath0 50% in her x-1 ) .",
    "the hard part of the spectrum is however significantly different , in particular it is much softer than in the two lmxb , and more reminescent of the spectra of the globular cluster sources .",
    "line emission , that has been recently added to the spectra of disk lmxb , is not formally required by our data . however",
    ", this might only be a limit of the data quality , rather than an intrinsic difference between the two groups of sources .",
    "it therefore appears that the spectral properties of the bulge reflect both the disk and the globular cluster lmxb properties ( assuming that her x-1 and 4u 1626 - 67 are typical of disk lmxb , which they could not be , since they are pulsating sources ) .",
    "this result is not surprising , since several sources contribute to the bulge emission , and a mixture of disk and globular cluster lmxb is to be expected , given the proposed identifications ( tf ; s97 ; p93 ) .    from the normalizations of the black body models , we derive a similar luminosity l@xmath43 4@xmath44 erg s@xmath19 in both components , and surface areas r@xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 km@xmath45 for the soft and the hard components respectively .",
    "the parameters for this latter are quite reasonable , and suggest the presence of @xmath48 neutron stars in the area , consistent with the imaging data ( tf , p93 ) .",
    "the parameters of the soft black body are less clearly understood .",
    "the luminosity would suggest the presence of @xmath49 her x-1 type sources ( assuming a black body luminosity of 6@xmath27 erg s@xmath19 , dal fiume et al .",
    "1998 ) , each with a radius of @xmath50 km ( which is larger than the radius of the neutron star in the system as this component is thought to be due to reprocessing in the accretion disk ) .",
    "this is in contrast both with the number of neutron stars derived from the hard data , with the total luminosity and with the shape of the hard spectrum .",
    "however , until we can precisely assess the proper model for the soft component , we can not reliably determine its intrinsic parameters .",
    "alternatively , we could consider whether the soft excess could be attributed to the diffuse emission apparent in the rosat bulge image , that p93 do not attribute to individual lower luminosity sources .",
    "p93 estimate that @xmath3% of the total bulge luminosity could be attributed to either a new class of sources or to a hot interstellar medium . in this latter case",
    ", it would most likely have a plasma spectrum . in our analysis",
    "however we find that the @xmath51 component contributes @xmath0 15% of the bulge luminosity in the rosat band , and would therefore only account for 1/2 of the residual emission . furthermore",
    ", this interpretation poses limits to the presence of her x-1 type sources from the bulge , since they also appear to contribute significantly to the soft band .",
    "spatially resolved spectra of the bulge are needed to clarify the issue further .",
    "irwin & sarazin have recently suggested that lmxb sources could be entirely responsible for the soft x ",
    "ray emission detected in the x  ray faintest early type galaxies .",
    "they suggest that the colors of lmxb and of the bulge of m31 determined within the rosat band are in excellent agreement with those of the low l@xmath52 objects , and that consequently the need to resort to additional components ( stellar coronae , a hot interstellar medium ) are significantly reduced .",
    "while the presence of at least 2 components in the bulge data has been established , with roughly the correct parameter values , which would support irwin & sarazin s proposal , the relative contributions appear to be different from what is measured in low x ",
    "ray luminosity early type galaxies .",
    "in early type galaxies , the soft and hard components contribute almost equal amounts in the 0.1 - 2 kev ( rosat ) band . in the harder @xmath4 band ( 0.2 - 4 kev ) the hard - to - soft ratio is @xmath53 and becomes @xmath54 in broader , harder bands ( kim et al .",
    "1996 ; fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1994 ) . in the r+b model ( used for the early type galaxy spectra )",
    ", the hard component contributes @xmath55 the soft component in the three bands respectively ( although similar ratios are found also in the asca results , this can not be used as a strong support , since asca data do not formally require the soft component ) .",
    "this would suggest that while qualitatively similar , the spectrum of the m31 bulge can not entirely reproduce the spectra of low x ",
    "ray luminosity early type galaxies , that require an additional component over the pure lmxb contribution . the positive detection of gas in one of the low l@xmath52 early type galaxies , ngc 1316 ( kim et al . 1998 ) ,",
    "further reinforces the need of more than just binaries in these objects .",
    "clearly , the presence of a soft component in the spectral properties of lmxb will have to be properly taken into account to correctly measure the contribution from an additional soft component in early type galaxies . on the other hand , the present observation shows that the spectral analysis of sources as complex as the bulge of m31 , in which the contribution of several different components and/or objects are expected , requires high signal to noise data over a large energy range , to properly assess the individual contributions , and correctly interprete the origin of each of them .",
    "it is to be expected that the forthcoming high throughput and high spatial resolution missions such as xmm and axaf will give us the wealth of data necessary to properly address the study of complex sources such as galaxies .",
    "we have measured the spectral characteristics of 10 individual sources and of the bulge region in m31 .",
    "most of the sources we have detected are identified with globular cluster , and they appear to have spectral properties consistent with those of the milky way sources .",
    "one of them however appears to have a significantly harder spectrum , uncharacteristic of lmxb with a weak field neutron star as the accreting object . since high mass x  ray binaries are extremely unlikely in globular clusters , we propose that either this is a mis - identification , or that the lmxb is a black - hole candidate",
    "this would be the first such object detected in globular clusters .    the bulge of m31 as a whole has a multicomponent spectrum . at high energies ,",
    "it is well modeled with a lmxb spectrum , consistent with the high resolution images that suggest the dominant presence of many individual sources in the area . at low energies , however , an additional component is needed to model excess emission below @xmath26 kev , also possibly associated with the lmxb disk population of the bulge .",
    "high energy emission is detected at @xmath2 kev with the pds instrument .",
    "it is likely that a major fraction of this emission results from the m31 bulge , although a contribution from other m31 sources can also be expected .",
    "as already discussed , due to the configuration of the  satellite , the positions of the sources are different in the two mecs instruments . in particular",
    ", the peak of the bulge emission is located right under the circular structure of the strongback in mecs2 , while it is at a smaller off - axis angle in mecs3 .",
    "the correction applied to the two sets of data are therefore different . on the other hand , the customized arf that we have produced takes into account the effects of the obscuration from the  strongback \" , as shown by the shape of the spectral models folded through the instrument response .",
    "moreover , the reliability of the arf has been further confirmed also on the spectral analysis of a couple of pulsars that are located at different off - axis angles in different observations , as already discussed earlier .",
    "the corrections included in the arf assume that the photons are distributed as a point source and refer to the peak position .",
    "this would suggest that the effective area file produced for mecs2 simulates more accurately the effects of the obscuration from the strongback than that produced for mecs3 , for which a more sophisticated model for the spatial distribution of the photon should be used , to take into account the fact that a larger fraction of photons than expected based on a psf model are obscured at off - peak positions .",
    "we also noticed that , if this assumption is correct , the flattening observed at lower energies in mecs3 is consistent with a heavier absorption , not properly corrected .    on the other hand , data obtained in a region covering the bulge emission but small enough to be  free \" from the strongback contamination ,",
    "should provide a cleaner way of determining the spectral parameters of the bulge ( if we choose to remain inside the strongback , where calibrations are better , we are in a situation analogous to source #  7 w.r.t .",
    "the strongback ) . in mecs3",
    "we can define a circle centered on the peak position of the bulge emission , while in mecs2 we can define only regions at the outskirts of the bulge .",
    "however , if the spectral parameters are uniform across the entire region this should not introduce additional parameters .",
    "we find that the spectral results obtained from these smaller areas are consistent with those from the whole source in the same instrument .",
    "this suggests that there are residual calibration problems even in regions ",
    "free \" of the strongback ( caution however should be taken in defining a region as  free \" of the strongback , since the boundaries of its effects are not sharp , and obscuration in its vicinities also also depend on the stability of the satellite during the observation ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the effects of the strongback on the spectral distribution of the photons from a point source are accounted for .",
    "we conclude that the extended and complex morphology of the source is responsible for the failure to reconcile the spectra from the two mecs , since it is likely that a very accurate and specific modeling not available at the present time is required to reproduce the effects of obscuration and scattering produced by the strongback .",
    "we have further checked the above considerations with lecs data .",
    "as discusses in   [ thebulge ] , lecs should provide a cleaner set of data for the bulge region . for a direct comparison with the mecs data , we have used the lecs data in the @xmath56 kev range .",
    "a single power law model gives @xmath57 ( intermediate between the two mecs ) , but it is not a good fit ( minimum @xmath58 = 1.5 for 14 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) . a broken power law or a bremsstrahlung model significantly improve the minimum @xmath59 value ( @xmath60 ) , again with best fit parameters intermediate between the single mecs values : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , e@xmath63 , @xmath58 = 0.8 for 13 dof ; or kt@xmath64 kev , @xmath58 = 0.8 for 14 dof .",
    "we retrieved the screened data files processed with rev2 from the archive .",
    "we have used data from all 4 instruments without further cleaning of the data , and selected the  bright \" data mode for sis0 and sis1 .",
    "this results in @xmath65 ks exposure for gis , and @xmath0 76 ks and @xmath0 81 ks for sis0 and sis1 respectively .",
    "spectral data have been extracted in circles , centered at the peak position of the x  ray source coincident with the bulge .",
    "for gis data , we have selected a circle of 20 pixel radius ( @xmath66 ) , while for sis data we have used a smaller circle of 30 pixels ( @xmath67 ) so that the source region is entirely contained in the ccd chip .",
    "this causes a problem in the flux determination , but should not affect the spectra if the characteristics are the same throughout the region .",
    "the background was obtained from a circle of the same dimension at the same detector position from the blank sky fields also available from the asca archive .",
    "arf files have been obtained with the @xmath68 routine in @xmath69 and the appropriate rmf have been obtained from the archive for gis and build with @xmath70 for sis .",
    "we have used the @xmath71 kev range for gis and @xmath72 kev for sis , to restrict ourselves to the best calibrated energies .",
    "we have then followed the same procedure as for the data , first on the sis and gis separately .",
    "we have forced the spectral parameters to be the same in different instruments but let the normalization free",
    ". at high energies , the data can be fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model , but the best fit temperatures of gis and sis are significantly different , higher for gis than for sis .",
    "an excess over a single temperature model is present at low energies .",
    "a discrepancy between gis and sis was already noticed in the spectral data of 3c 273 , reported in the comparison of asca / xte / results ( yaqoob et al .",
    "1997 ) , although the discrepancy goes in the opposite sense than here .",
    "we checked that this result is not due to the different extraction regions ( smaller for sis ) by extracting the gis in the same size circle , and found almost identical best fit values . since asca - sis ,",
