    "a skyrmion is a particle - like topologically nontrivial soliton @xcite which is studied in a variety of research fields , especially in the condensed matter physics such as the quantum hall effects @xcite , the liquid crystals @xcite , and the helical ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "it is noted early that skyrmions in three dimensions ( 3d ) have physical properties of baryons while skyrmions in two - dimensional ( 2d ) play an important role in condensed matter systems . in recent experiments",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the 2d skyrmion spontaneously appears as the ground state in the helical magnets@xcite and in the quantum hall systems at fillings slightly away from unity .",
    "since the experimental realization of quantized vortices in alkali atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , phenomena related to the internal degrees of freedom are appealing for the investigation of topological objects@xcite .",
    "furthermore , precise spin manipulation techniques have been developed to prepare topological spin structures of interest and provide unique opportunities to study their stability and dynamics @xcite .",
    "the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction may lead to the formation of a skyrme crystal .",
    "meanwhile , the periodic skyrmion crystal configurations could be used to model nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "such a state was recently observed in a neutron scattering experiment@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to seek exact stationary solutions to the 2d coupled nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) which describe the pseudo - spin-1/2 becs .",
    "the intra- and inter - species interactions are assumed to be equal and the system is exposed to a uniform external field .",
    "we propose a method to decouple the gpes by re - combinations of the nonlinearity and the spatial dimensions .",
    "periodic solutions are obtained which are shown to form the skyrmion crystals in the pseudo - spin representation . in sec.ii",
