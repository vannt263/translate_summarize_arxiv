    "additionally , in the fusion technology applications , zirconium hydrides are unavoidably precipitated in the excess of the hydrogen solubility , which may adversely affect several mechanical and thermal properties in some crystal orientations @xcite involving different stable and metastable hydride phases which may lead to a significant embrittlement .",
    "furthermore , zirconium hydrides are also served as a part of the promising new type of actinide hydride fuels , such as u-(th - np - am)-zr - h @xcite .",
    "consequently , great attentions are needed to focus on the basic scientific research of zirconium hydrides .",
    "since 1952 , there has occurred in literature large amounts of experimental investigations on zirconium hydrides .",
    "the electronic structures of zrh@xmath2 ( 1.63@xmath3x@xmath31.94 ) was studied using photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation @xcite , where the jahn - teller effect is demonstrated by the changes of electrons occupation at the fermi level .",
    "an assessed h - zr phase diagram was successfully constructed by zuzek _",
    "@xcite in 1990 . and",
    "the transition between the cubic and the tetragonal phases has been suggested by ducastelle _",
    "@xcite to be of jahn - teller type too . from theoretical point of view",
    ", the phase transition between cubic and tetragonal phases has been investigated by switendick @xcite , where the non - self - consistent augmented plane wave ( apw ) method was employed .",
    "most importantly , the study of the electronic structure and energetics for the tetragonal distortion in zrh@xmath0 has been extensively performed .",
    "using the pseudopotential method with both local density approximation ( lda ) and general gradient approximation ( gga ) , ackland @xcite obtained a double minimum in the energy surface , one minimum for _ _ c / a__@xmath41 and the other for _ _ c / a__@xmath51 with an energy barrier in between of roughly 0.1 ev .",
    "but the ground state for _ _ c / a__@xmath51 was in clear disagreement with the experimental data @xcite . recently , wolf and herzig @xcite and quijano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the accurate total energy and the electronic structure characteristic of zrh@xmath0 by using lda and gga , respectively , within the full potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method .",
    "both of these works obtained the correct ground state for _ _ c / a__@xmath41 and made a clear explanation of the cubic to tetragonal distortion .    however , despite the abundant theoretical and experimental research on zirconium hydrides , relatively little is known regarding their chemical bonding nature , mechanical properties , and the phonon dispersions .",
    "until now , the elastic properties , which relate to various fundamental solid state properties such as interatomic potentials , equation of states , phonon spectra , and thermodynamical properties are nearly unkown for zrh@xmath0 . moreover , although the electronic properties as well as the chemical bonding in zirconium dihydride have been calculated @xcite , the study of the bonding nature of zr - h involving its mixed ionic / covalent character is still lacking . as a consequence ,",
    "these facts inhibit deep understanding of the zirconium dihydride .",
    "motivated by these observations , in this paper , we present a first - principles study by calculating the structural , electronic , mechanical , and thermodynamical properties of zirconium dihydride .",
    "our calculated results show that the bistable structure of zrh@xmath0 is the fct phase at _ _ c / a__=0.885 and _ _ c / a__=1.111 , respectively . the mechanical and dynamical stability of fct and fcc phases of zrh@xmath0 are carefully analyzed .",
    "in addition , through bader analysis @xcite we find that about 1.5 electrons transfer from each zr atom to h atom for zrh@xmath0 .",
    "our total energy calculations are self - consistently carried out using density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , which is based on pseudopotentials and plane wave basis functions .",
