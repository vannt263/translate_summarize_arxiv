    "the principal purpose of this paper is to provide proofs for several inequalities involving bandlimited functions ( see section  [ sec_summary ] below ) . while some of these inequalities are known from `` numerical experience '' ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , their proofs appear to be absent in the literature .",

    "while defines @xmath4 for all real @xmath5 , one is often interested in bandlimited functions , whose argument is confined to an interval , e.g. @xmath6 .",
    "such functions are encountered in physics ( wave phenomena , fluid dynamics ) , engineering ( signal processing ) , etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "about 50 years ago it was observed that the eigenfunctions of the integral operator @xmath7 \\to l^2\\left[-1,1\\right]$ ] , defined via the formula @xmath8 } { \\left ( x \\right ) } = \\int_{-1}^1 \\varphi(t ) e^{icxt } \\ ; dt , \\label{eq_intro_fc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provide a natural tool for dealing with bandlimited functions , defined on the interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "moreover , it was observed ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that the eigenfunctions of @xmath10 are precisely the prolate spheroidal wave functions ( pswfs ) , well known from the mathematical physics ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "this property , being remarkable by itself , also plays an important role in both the analysis of pswfs and the associated numerical algorithms ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is perhaps surprising , however , that the analytical properties of pswfs have not been investigated as thoroughly as those of several other classes of special functions . in particular ,",
    "when one reads through the classical works about the pswfs ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , one is amazed by the number of properties stated without rigorous proofs .",

    "still , the gap between numerical experience and asymptotic expansions , on the one hand , and rigorously proven explicit bounds and estimates , on the other hand , is rather wide ; this paper offers a partial remedy for this deficiency .",
    "this paper is mostly devoted to the analysis of the differential operator @xmath11 , defined via .",
    "in particular , several explicit bounds for the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are derived .",
    "these bounds turn out to be fairly tight , and the resulting inequalities lead to rigorous proofs of several other properties of pswfs .",
    "the analysis is illustrated through several numerical experiments .",
