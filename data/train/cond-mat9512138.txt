    "surfaces of fcc metals , in particular ( 110 ) faces , display a variety of phase transitions which have been the subject of considerable experimental and theoretical work .",
    "experimentally , the ( 110 ) faces of some fcc metals  such as au or pt  reconstruct at low temperature into a @xmath0 missing - row ( mr ) or related structures , whereas other metals  like ag , ni , cu , rh , and pd  retain ( at least when clean ) their bulk  like periodicity .",
    "as temperature is raised , reconstructed surfaces tend to show two separate transitions : a critical deconstruction transition , and , at a higher temperature , a kosterlitz - thouless roughening transition.@xcite on the other hand , unreconstructed surfaces have not been shown , so far , to reveal a similar two - transition scenario . only a roughening transition is well documented in this case.@xcite    based on theoretical considerations and on simulation work , an interesting and nontrivial interplay has been anticipated between in - plane disordering , related to deconstruction , and vertical disordering , related to roughening,@xcite and many other studies have been devoted to the problem .",
    "@xcite the situation is , in principle , somewhat different for the two types of situations , i.e. , the unreconstructed and the mr reconstructed cases . on an fcc ( 110 ) surface one can identify two interpenetrating rectangular sublattices , with origin , say , at @xmath2 ( the `` white '' sublattice ) and a at @xmath3 ( the `` black '' sublattice ) where @xmath4 is the lattice parameter , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the unreconstructed ( ideal ) surface has therefore _ two _ @xmath8 ground states , differing for the sublattice which occupies the top layer ( see fig .  [",
    "gs : fig ] ) .",
    "den nijs has argued that , in such a case , the phase diagram should be qualitatively the same as that of a simple cubic ( 100 ) surface.@xcite in particular , den nijs,@xcite jug and tosatti,@xcite kohanoff _",
    "et al._,@xcite and mazzeo _",
    "et al._@xcite argued that ( 110 ) surfaces like those of ag and pd ( which do not reconstruct ) are good candidates for realizations of _ preroughening _ , a critical ( non - universal ) transition from a low temperature ordered phase to an intermediate _ disordered flat _ phase , previously identified in the context of restricted solid - on - solid models for simple cubic ( 100 ) surfaces.@xcite in terms of the two ground states of the unreconstructed surface , the preroughening transition can be viewed as a disordering of the surface due to the proliferation of monoatomic steps ( see fig .",
    "[ defects : fig ] ) separating terraces with one type of ground state from others where the other ground state is locally present .",
    "these steps retain , however , an up - down long range order  stabilized by a combination of up - up ( down - down ) step repulsion and entropy  which prevents the surface from being rough.@xcite    on the @xmath0 mr reconstructed surfaces , with half of the @xmath9 close - packed rows missing , the periodicity in the @xmath10 direction is doubled .",
    "the surface has therefore _ four _ degenerate @xmath8 ground states , which can be classified by a clock variable @xmath11 , according to the `` color '' and the position of the mr in the doubled unit cell , i.e. , determined by which of the four sublattices sits in the top layer ( see fig .  [",
    "gs : fig ] ) .",
    "the elementary extended defects which one can consider here were discussed by vilfan and villain @xcite and den nijs @xcite ( see fig .  [ defects : fig ] ) .",
    "these are a ) _ steps _ , which simultaneously change the average height by @xmath12 , and the reconstruction variable @xmath13 by @xmath14 [ _ clockwise _ or @xmath15 steps ] or @xmath16 [ _ anticlockwise _ or @xmath17 steps ] , b ) _ ising wall defects _ with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which can be seen as a tightly bound state between two steps of opposite sign ( up and down ) , but _ same _",
    "@xmath20.@xcite    in this framework , den nijs introduced a phenomenological four state clock - step model to describe the interplay between reconstruction and roughening degrees of freedom.@xcite the model is formulated on a length scale larger than microscopic , through the introduction of a coarse grained lattice of cells in which a integer variable @xmath21 , representing the average height in the cell , and a clock reconstruction variable @xmath22 are defined .",
    "a bond in the lattice can be either empty ( no defect ) , or occupied by an up or down step of either kind , or doubly occupied by an up and down step of the same kind ( equivalent to an ising wall ) .",
    "den nijs found that when @xmath17 and @xmath15 steps have the same energy ",
    "the so - called _ zero chirality limit _  the model displays two possible scenarios : _ ( i ) _ if the energy of an ising wall @xmath23 is less than roughly twice the energy of a step @xmath24 , temperature drives the system from the ordered phase to a disordered flat phase through an ising transition , and then to a rough phase through a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition ; _ ( ii ) _ when steps are energetically favored , @xmath25 , the system undergoes a single roughening  plus  deconstruction transition , which is ising - like for the reconstruction degrees of freedom and kt - like for the height degrees of freedom .",
    "the disordered flat phase present for @xmath26 is quite clearly characterized by the proliferation of ising wall defects ( their free energy per unit length goes to zero at the deconstruction ) .",
    "accordingly , the surface shows a prevalence of @xmath27 and @xmath28 terraces , say , over @xmath29 and @xmath30 ones . using the terminology introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a phase could be called disordered even flat ( def ) .",
    "it has an obvious non - zero order parameter which counts the difference in the abundance of @xmath31 terraces over that of @xmath32 ones , and vanishing only in the rough phase .",
    "by contrast , when single steps dominate ",
    "i.e. , @xmath33  there is apparently no mechanism , in this simple model , which may stabilize the up - down long range order for steps , typical of disordered flat phases .",
    "it has been argued that suitable interactions penalizing the crossing of two up - up or two down - down steps  not considered by den nijs  could stabilize such a hypothetical step - dominated disordered flat phase.@xcite a disordered flat phase of this kind  termed dof in ref .",
    "@xcite  should be characterized by an equal abundance of all types of cells @xmath11 , i.e. , by _ a vanishing of the order parameter characterizing the def phase_.@xcite    interestingly , the situation does not change much in the so - called _ strong chirality limit _ considered by den nijs , i.e. , when anti - clockwise steps , say , are very costly and thus completely negligible . in such a case",
    "the problem may be mapped onto a one - dimensional fermionic model containing a hubbard type on - site step - step interaction @xmath34 such that the energy of a ising wall configuration ( doubly occupied site ) is @xmath35.@xcite for @xmath36 , the result is the same as in the zero chirality limit case , i.e. , a def phase is obtained . when steps dominate ",
    "i.e. , for @xmath37  two distinct rough phases appear , the deconstruction transition is no longer of the ising type , but , again , no disordered flat phase exists .",
    "the variety of possibilities introduced by the phenomenological models is thus very rich .",
    "microscopic _ models display just the same , or any new features , one might ask ? in the light of the previous discussion , the question naturally arises as to what kind of disordered flat phase ( or phases ) is realized in simple solid - on - solid ( sos ) models .",
    "the question has been considered by mazzeo _",
    "et al . _ , who have introduced , and studied by monte carlo simulation , a restricted sos model which is able to deal with both unreconstructed and reconstructed situations.@xcite their model  which we will refer to as `` @xmath38model ''  is a simple modification of the exactly solvable body - centered solid - on - solid model ( bcsos ) @xcite obtained by adding a further neighbor interaction , which can stabilize the @xmath0 mr reconstruction if required . for a reconstructed case",
    ", they find two - transitions : a 2d - ising deconstruction to a disordered flat phase , and a kt roughening at a slightly higher temperature .",
    "the unreconstructed case studied also shows two transitions , with a non - universal critical transition to a disordered flat phase followed by a kt roughening.@xcite the nature of the disordered flat phase present in the model was , however , not fully characterized .    in the spirit of investigating simple but fully microscopic models , santoro and fabrizio",
    "have studied a slightly different modification of the bcsos model , which will be referred to as `` @xmath39model''.@xcite they found that this model could be mapped onto a quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with further - neighbor interactions.@xcite the phase diagram they obtained has two low - temperature ordered phases  unreconstructed or @xmath0 mr reconstructed , depending on the parameters of the interactions  a high - temperature rough phase , and an intermediate disordered flat phase .",
    "the physics of the disordered flat phase was argued , by analytical arguments , to be akin to that of the _ dimer quantum spin phase _ studied by haldane , @xcite i.e. , a doubly degenerate state which breaks translational invariance and in which dimer - dimer correlation functions acquire long range order .    in this paper",
    "we extend and apply the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in such a way as to provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of all the simple bcsos - like microscopic models of fcc ( 110 ) surfaces studied so far .",
    "first we show that a quantum spin-1/2 hamiltonian also underlies the more general restricted sos model where both the couplings considered in refs.@xcite and @xcite are included .",
    "the spin-1/2 model is , in all cases , a heisenberg chain with @xmath40 competing antiferromagnetic interactions ranging up to third neighbors .",
    "secondly , we unambiguously show that the dimer - phase scenario is realized in the disordered flat phase , and discuss in detail the surface physics implications of such a scenario .",
    "long - range dimer order suggests ( see section [ dimer : sec ] ) a particular type of long - range order for the correlation function between @xmath0steps , and also between _ local surface maxima_. in particular , one is led to study an order parameter @xmath41  previously introduced by bernasconi and tosatti @xcite  which measures the difference in the number of local surface maxima belonging to the white and the black sublattice of a fcc(110 ) . due to `` shadowing '' , or to surface lattice contraction , this order parameter is related to antiphase scattering intensity of he - atoms of x - rays , respectively , and is thus a quantity of direct interest .",
    "( see section [ mc : sec ] . )",
    "@xmath41 is studied by finite - size analysis of classical monte carlo data , and found to be non - zero in the disordered flat phase of both the @xmath38 and @xmath39model .",

    "the ( 110 ) surface of a fcc lattice is comprised of two interpenetrating rectangular sublattices of lattice constants @xmath42 , which we will conventionally refer to as the white ( w ) and the black ( b ) sublattice .",
    "the surface lattice basis vectors are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . in the ideal unreconstructed ( 110 ) surface ,",
    "one of the two sublattices lies above the other at a distance @xmath47 . within a solid - on - solid ( sos ) framework,@xcite one associates to each site @xmath48 of the lattice a height variable @xmath21 which can take only _ integer _ values ( take @xmath49 ) .",
    "the models we are going to study have an additional restriction , in that the height difference between each site and its four nearest neighbors ( belonging to the other sublattice ) are forced to be @xmath12 . a height difference of @xmath2",
    "is therefore excluded , as well as larger values of @xmath50 ( they are energetically more costly ) . as a consequence , the values of @xmath21 are forced to have opposite parity on the two sublattices , say even on w and odd on b. this restriction is typical of the bcsos model.@xcite it is probably justified for a metal , where strong inward relaxation makes the first  second ",
    "layer bonds extra strong . on the contrary",
    ", it should not be expected to hold for , say , a rare gas solid ( 110 ) face , where these bonds are in fact weaker .",
    "our hamiltonian is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 describes interactions between sublattice nearest neighbors , and @xmath53 takes into account further - neighbor interactions which will favor or disfavor reconstructed phases .",
    "specifically , @xmath52 is given by @xmath54 with different coupling strengths in the two directions to take into account the anisotropy of the surface .",
    "@xmath55 will be always assumed to be _ positive _ and is generally the largest energy in the problem .",
    "the correspondent physics is that it is very costly to create a kink on a tightly packed @xmath9 row .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath56 , i.e. , of the coupling between rows , is instead much smaller , since atoms in neighbouring rows are only second bulk neighbours . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the @xmath58 surface is stable in its @xmath17 unreconstructed form . if @xmath59 we recover the bcsos model which is exactly solved through a mapping to the six vertex model,@xcite and shows a",
    "_ single transition_. this is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type , between a low - temperature ordered ( unreconstructed ) flat phase and a high - temperature disordered rough phase . for @xmath60",
    "the surface becomes unstable against @xmath9 step formation . in this case the final stable state is determined by more distant interactions , contained in @xmath61 . as for @xmath61",
    ", two possible simple choices have been made in the literature , corresponding to what we will refer to as the `` @xmath38model '' and the `` @xmath39model '' .",

    "the introduction of this further - neighbor interaction stabilizes the @xmath0 mr reconstructed phase.@xcite in fact , it is very easy to check that @xmath60 , @xmath65 stabilizes an ordered succession of up and down @xmath9 steps , which is precisely the @xmath0 mr state .",
    "an alternative way of stabilizing the same @xmath0 mr state against @xmath66 faceting is realized with the @xmath39model , whose @xmath61 reads @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "the fourth neighbor interaction in the x - direction has the effect , once again , of increasing the energy of configurations with @xmath69 .",
    "this model was originally proposed by kohanoff and tosatti,@xcite and has been recently studied in detail in ref .",
    "more generally , we could include both types of couplings by taking @xmath70 in subsequent calculations and simulations , the lattice will be taken to have @xmath71 primitive cells , i.e. , @xmath72 sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in both directions . a schematic representation of the lattice and of the interactions considered is given in fig .  [ lattice : fig ]",
    ".    the classical @xmath8 ground states for both models are easy to work out as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath73 or @xmath74 . for both models",
    "one finds that @xmath75 corresponds to an unreconstructed ground state [ or @xmath17 ] , whereas for @xmath77 the ground state is @xmath0 mr reconstructed.@xcite for the sake of completeness , we mention that , for the @xmath38model , the ground state degenerates into an infinite @xmath66 large facet as soon as @xmath78.@xcite for the @xmath39model , on the contrary , an infinite @xmath66 facet sets is only for @xmath79 , and there is a whole series of intermediate regions [ @xmath80 with @xmath81 where the ground state is @xmath82 mr reconstructed . in the following",
    "we will be interested exclusively in the region of parameter space where the interplay between unreconstructed and @xmath0 mr reconstructed phases takes place , hence @xmath83 .",
    "neglecting adatoms , vacancies and ( as necessary in sos models ) overhangs , the defects which should play a role in the disordering and roughening transitions are unbound steps and bound pairs of steps , i.e. , ising domain walls .",

    "it is worth noting that the @xmath38model has defects whose energy goes to zero as @xmath84 .",
    "these are the @xmath0step and the @xmath85wall in the @xmath17 case , and the anticlockwise  step and the ising wall in the @xmath0 reconstructed case .",
    "since this leads to zero - point entropy , the @xmath84 region is therefore somewhat unphysical for the @xmath38model , where one might expect disorder to occur at very low temperatures.@xcite as a second point , we observe that in the @xmath39model a combination of two ising walls wins against combinations involving clockwise ",
    "steps for @xmath86 , while it always wins against anticlockwise  steps . in principle",
    ", therefore , a def ( wall dominated ) phase seems to be plausible for @xmath87 in the @xmath39model . later on",
    "we will present results which show how ground state defect energy considerations can be somewhat misleading : the disordered phase obtained does not have the features of an ideal def .",
    "an elegant and convenient way of studying the temperature phase diagram of the classical two - dimensional models introduced in the previous section consists in mapping them into one - dimensional quantum problems.@xcite the general procedure is well known,@xcite but we review it here for our specific case , and for the reader s convenience .",
    "the method consists in viewing the y - direction of the lattice as the ( imaginary ) time direction of an appropriate 1d quantum problem , different row configurations in the x - direction being viewed as subsequent time - slices for the quantum problem .",
    "the physical requirement which will turn out to be important is that the coupling @xmath55 in the y - direction is strong , while the other couplings are much weaker ( strong anisotropy limit ) .",
    "the starting point for the mapping is a transfer matrix formulation of the classical partition function @xmath88 .",

    "we must have @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we can associate to any row configuration @xmath103 a state @xmath104 in the hilbert space of a quantum spin-1/2 chain ( of length @xmath105 ) by the relationship @xmath106 ( in doing so we lose information on the absolute height of the surface , which is however irrelevant in a static context . )",
    "[ gs : fig ] illustrates the explicit mapping of the @xmath17 and @xmath0 ground states in terms of spin configurations .",

    "the outcome of our study is that neither of those simple prototypes applies , strictly speaking , to the description of the disordered flat phase we find , which is , on the contrary , closely related to dimer phase of one dimensional quantum spin-1/2 systems .",

    "second , the transition line between the unreconstructed and the df phase ( preroughening ) has variable exponents , as was predicted.@xcite third , the disordered phase has a non - trivial order parameter @xmath41 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that both the microscopic models discussed here and the cell model of ref .",
    "@xcite point in the same direction , to a disordered flat phase which has a non - vanishing order parameter of the type of @xmath41 .",
    "we recognize that such a feature is also present in the phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the obvious open question is whether the disordered phase discussed above is the only one possible .",
    "in other words , can we build microscopic models were defects other than @xmath0-steps play a role and the resulting disordered flat phase ( or phases ) has qualitatively different features ?",
    "the discussion has to consider separately , at this stage , the case of semi ",
    "microscopic cell - type models @xcite from that of fully microscopic surface models . in the former framework of a coarse - grained description of the system , as the four state clock - step model of den nijs @xcite ,",
    "the stage is clear and the actors are there : walls and steps .",
    "since white atoms stay on top in regions where the reconstruction variable @xmath13 is @xmath2 or @xmath308 , and black atoms do so in regions where @xmath13 is @xmath307 or @xmath411 , the @xmath41 order parameter has to be non - zero in the disordered flat phase of this model , which could therefore be called def .",

    ", @xmath41 is expected to vanish in a hypothetical dof phase , since in this case the relevant defects are steps , which involve a change of @xmath412 for @xmath13.@xcite the four values of @xmath13 should appear with the same probability in such a disordered phase , and there is no way of telling which `` color '' prevails in the top atoms .    the question of possibly finding a dof phase in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite in a model of the clock - step type deserves , however , a few comments .",
    "suppose that steps were indeed the most energetically favorable objects in the problem , @xmath413 , and imagine desiring a stable dof phase , i.e. , preventing the appearance of steps from making the surface immediately rough .",
    "the natural way of doing this is to assign vertex energies to the crossing of steps , in such a way as to _ disfavor the crossing of parallel steps _ with respect to antiparallel ones.@xcite this is indeed the standard mechanism by which a dof is stabilized in the context of rsos models for simple cubic ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "such 6-vertex energies have been neglected by den nijs in deriving the zero - chirality limit phase diagram for the clock - step model.@xcite it is therefore an appealing suggestion , deserving further study , that their proper inclusion might open up the possibility of a genuine dof phase in the model.@xcite    microscopic sos models are in many ways attractive , at first sight , as far as stabilizing a dof is concerned : they automatically tend to disfavor crossing of parallel steps which involve large height differences . moreover",
    ", tuning the model parameters offers , in principle , the possibility of making steps _ or _",
    "walls more favorable , at least as far as their @xmath8 energy is concerned .",
    "things are however not so straightforward in practice .",
    "consider , as a remarkable counter - example , the case of the @xmath39model .",
    "when @xmath414 , the ground state is @xmath0 mr reconstructed , and simple ising wall defects are energetically more favorable with respect to all kinds of steps ( see table 1 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath415 , which we considered in one of the simulations , would have seemed therefore a quite promising candidate for a def phase .",
    "what we end up with is , instead , a situation quite well represented by the snapshot in fig .",
    "[ snapshot : fig ] .",
    "the state of the system looks as predicted for a dimer spin state .",
    "we clearly see that there are large regions in which the surface looks unreconstructed ( with either the w or the b sublattice on the top layer ) , separated by @xmath0 steps , forming a fluid with up - down order but without positional order .",
    "it is worth stressing that the relevant objects in such a disordered phase ",
    "the @xmath0 steps  are the most natural defects of the _ unreconstructed _ surface , and the very building blocks of the neighboring mr reconstructed surface ( which can be seen as a solid of alternating @xmath0 steps ) .",
    "the result of tailoring the @xmath8 defect energies in such a way as to promote an ising - wall dominated def phase , ends up with an amusing realization of a dimer state instead .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that a dimer phase type of disordered flat phase is a natural candidate in systems with a bcsos - type of symmetry like the fcc(110 ) surfaces considered in this work .",
    "experimental signatures of such a scenario would be the the detection of a rapid fall of the anti - phase scattering intensity as the critical temperature is approached , followed by an intermediate temperature region ( before roughening ) in which the dominant defects are monoatomic steps , and where a small coherent anti - phase scattering intensity survives",
