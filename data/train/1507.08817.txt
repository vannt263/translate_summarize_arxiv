    "despite numerous studies indicating anomalous temporal statistics and scaling in spontaneous human activity and interhuman communication @xcite , there is much on - going discussion on the origin and universality of observed statistical laws .",
    "behavioural processes are frequently conveniently characterized in terms of stimulus - response approach @xcite , by adapting the same systematically repeated external sensory protocol , which allows to estimate the statistics of subject s responses . in a more general approach , in which brains are conceived as information processing input - output systems @xcite ,",
    "the observed self - similar temporal patterns of non - stimulated spontaneous neuronal activity can be determined by analysing spatiotemporal statistics of location and timing of neural signals .",
    "similar to scale - free fluctuations detected in psychophysical time series , also dynamics of collective neuronal activity at various levels of nervous systems exhibit power - law scalings .",
    "remarkable scale - free fluctuations and long - range correlations have been detected on long time scales ( minutes and hours ) in data recorded with magneto- and electroencephalography @xcite , and have been attributed to the underlying dynamic architecture of spontaneous brain activity discovered with functional mri ( fmri ) and defined by correlated slow fluctuations in blood oxygenation level - dependent ( bold ) signals .    on the other hand , negative deflections in local field potentials recorded at much shorter time scales ( milliseconds )",
    "have been shown to form spatiotemporal cascades ( neuronal avalanches ) of activity , whose size ( amplitude ) and lifetime distributions are again well described by power laws . these power - law scaling behaviours and",
    "fractal properties of neuronal long - range temporal correlations and avalanches strongly suggest that the brain operates near a critical , self - organized state @xcite with neuronal interactions shaping both , temporal correlation spectra and distribution of signal intensities .",
    "it seems thus plausible to further investigate timing , location and amplitudes of such cascades to gain information about underlying patterns of brain rhythms and to identify characteristics of stochastic spatial point processes which can serve as reliable models of the governing dynamics .",
    "also , if the behaviour can be described and interpreted as resulting interface between brain dynamics and the environment , scale invariant features may be expected to emerge in human cognition @xcite and human motion @xcite .",
    "some neurological and psychopathic diseases such as parkinson s disease , vascular dementia , alzheimer s disease , schizophrenia , chronic pain and even sleep disorders and depression are related to abnormal activity symptoms @xcite .",
    "so far , there are many non - unique evaluative measures used in clinical practice to determine severity of these disorders or the effect of applied drugs .",
    "the challenge thus remains to what extent correlations during resting state ( spontaneous ) activity are altered in disease states and whether a set of characteristic parameters can be classified unambiguously to describe statistics of healthy versus unhealthy mind states and spatiotemporal organization of such disrupted brain dynamics .",
    "an objective measure of differences in sleep durations and effects of sleep deficit on restlessness and impulsivity in human activity is based on _",
    "actigraph recording_. the instrument is used in sleep assessment to discriminate between stages of sleep and wake through documented body movements @xcite .",
    "the analysis of actigraphy data is frequently considered a cost - effective method of first choice , used both in clinical research and practice .    the aim of this study is to apply various complexity measures for large activity datasets and to quantify use of advanced statistical methods for activity data .",
    "our analysis is based on assumption that a typical actigraph time series that monitor records of movements per fixed time period of known duration can be analysed as a stochastic point process .",
    "we establish a time - inhomogeneity of such a renewal process and describe its fractional character by analysing counting number distributions .",
    "the renewal process is specified by probability laws describing waiting times or inter - arrival ( inter - event ) times @xcite .",
    "the survival probability @xmath0 is a common measure that relates the ( mean ) time of discharge ( or escape time ) to the probability density function @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the poisson case , for which a characteristic mean time of escape exists , fractional point processes may possess @xmath2 and @xmath3 functions which do not decay exponentially but algebraically . as a consequence of the power - law asymptotics , the process is then non - markovian with a long memory , which may result in a lack of characteristic time - scales for relaxation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in subsequent sections the method of data collection is presented ( section ii ) , followed by a brief description of a stochastic point process ( section iii ) which serves as a model for further statistical analysis .",
    "section iv demonstrates our results obtained by use of different complexity measures .",
    "the findings are concluded in section v.",
    "an actigraph is a watch - like device worn on the wrist that uses an accelerometer to measure any slight body movement over the investigated period of time .",
    "this instrument applies simple algorithms ( time - above - threshold , zero - crossing , and digital integration ) to summarize the overall intensity of the measured movement within consecutive time - periods ( usually 1 - 2 minutes long ) , so that the events recorded represent activity counts .",
    "the most general approach to analyse such a recording is to reduce the time series of measurements to a summary statistic such as sleep / wake ratios , sleep time , wake after sleep onset , and ratios of night - time activity to daytime or total activity @xcite .",
    "while such summary measures allow for hypothesis testing using classic statistical methods @xcite , large amounts of relevant information are disclosed in those complex data when more advanced tools of quantification ( cf .",

    "the circadian cycle of both groups differs substantially : while rw individuals have relatively long  nights \" and short  days \" , members of the sd group are characterized by a reversed motif of longer  days \" and shorter  nights \" , which clearly influences their activity / rest patterns . to overcome this problem we normalized the  days \" and  nights \" of both groups to the same length .",
    "the resulting time series have been statistically analysed as described previously in @xcite .",
    "in addition , in this study , complexity analysis has been extended to describe the statistics of events counts as a function of the observation time .",
    "many pulse signals observed in nature can be described in terms of stochastic point processes , i.e. , sequences of random points @xmath4 arriving in time @xcite .",
    "the simplest realization of such signals can be a  spike train \" composed of delta peaks arriving at random times @xmath5 .",

    "since dispersion of @xmath25 is finite in this case , very long inter - event times are exponentially rare .    passing the @xmath26-pulse signal of intensity @xmath27 through a linear filter @xmath28 results in  shot noise `` with exponentially decaying pulses @xmath29.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equations represent a basic model @xcite for synaptic noise with @xmath30 standing for a neuron s membrane potential and @xmath25 denoting relaxation time of the activated neuron . in more general terms",

    "the survival probability @xmath2 is expected to have a characteristic scale ( a relaxation time @xmath111 ) related to the probability @xmath112 .",
    "in contrast , for non - stationary complex systems with inhomogeneous distributions of decay times @xmath111 , the resulting complementary distribution @xmath2 may be scale invariant @xcite .    to further asses this point , we have assumed that the human subjects can be in two states ( active or resting ) with some dwell time distributions characterizing duration of active and resting phases .",

    "have been compared with the two - tailed @xmath45-tests performed at 95% confidence level , preceded by a set of tests for equal variances , as explained elsewhere @xcite . in the case of activity periods",
    "no clear difference between the rw and sd individuals has been observed .",
    "the overall fit ( averaged over days and individuals ) yields for the rw sample @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "similar values for the sd mode are not significantly different ( @xmath121 ; two - tailed @xmath45-test ) .    unlike these findings , the cumulative distributions @xmath2 of rest period durations , averaged over all participants indicate a significant difference in behavioural motifs between the control group and sleep deprived individuals .",
    "specifically , the means @xmath122 of exponents for rw and sd subjects are different at 5% level , with p - value @xmath123 ( for 4-hour sleep followed by 14-hour daytime activity ) ; additional leave - one out cross - validation was performed with the same conclusion . as mentioned before in sec .",
    "[ sec : ff ] , the reverse scheme of 14-hour daytime activity followed by 4-hour sleep ( the length of time series stays as before , but different parts of data are cut away ) was checked as well . in this instance , the means @xmath122 do not differ at 5% level , with p - value @xmath124 .",
    "the higher ( average ) coefficient @xmath125 extracted for sleep - deficient individuals emphasizes the fact that the pattern of their resting times consists of more short periods and , respectively , fewer longer inactivity time intervals than in the control group .",
    "vulnerability to chronic sleep deprivation is a complex phenomenon in which performance , subjective and neural measures indicate distinct features , possibly related to chronotype , somnotype and gender @xcite . although not used routinely as a measurement of choice for evaluating the severity of locomotor disorders related to sleep deprivation in patients , the actigraphy records are considered by many researchers and medical doctors a valuable tool for demonstrating behavioural disturbances related to sleep deficit .",
    "information detected in actigraph data provide measures for sleep and wake motifs in healthy individuals and in people with certain sleep problems and can be used to establish links between duration of sleep and fatigue and performance effectiveness @xcite . in particular , it seems that a strategy of assessment based on use of actigraphy recordings may serve as an objective tool to discriminate behavioural patterns associated with shortness of sleep and insomnia @xcite .    in this paper properties of actigraph time - records",
    "have been analysed by use of multiple complexity measures .",
    "presented model of a non - uniform random point process had successfully explained the main properties of analysed time - series indicating clustering of event counts as measured by fano and allan factors .",
    "provided estimates allow to detect correlations in inter - event periods typical for a fractal stochastic process @xcite .",
    "both factors increase with the counting time window as @xmath54 suggesting variability of the response ( activity counts ) characterized by the autocorrelation function : the linear growth in @xmath52 of the event count variance is characteristic of a diffusive process .",
    "in contrast , the ff value increasing as a power function of the counting window indicates that fluctuations in the rate are observable on many time scales with a self - similar exponent @xmath56 .",
    "the fano factors derived in our study are always larger than 1 , documenting that the rate of events in the data is an inhomogeneous process with aggregated event - counts .",
    "this super - poissonian behaviour is observed for bothnocturnal and day - time recordings .",
    "similarly , the allan factor which allows to detect the average variation in the pattern of adjacent counts , also points to the time correlations in analysed series .",
    "nevertheless , variations of extracted ff and af coefficients in both groups of examined subjects exclude drawing inference in hypothesis testing and do not allow to discriminate between the degree of correlation and patterns of bursting in the counts of events observed for the control ( rw ) or sleep - deprived ( sd ) individuals . in parallel to these findings ,",
    "the complexity scores based on dfa analysis stay in conformity with the observed self - affinity of activity signals .",
    "however , while series of nocturnal recordings display a higher median of the hurst exponent for the sd group with respect to the rw subjects , applied significance tests show no clear difference between the control group and the group with sleep deficiency . that observation limits practical use of dfa analysis in the identification of reduced sleep dynamics , in contrast to results on sleep impaired subjects diagnosed with acute insomnia @xcite .",
    "to further identify the best mathematical model behind measured activity signals , they can be tested for stationarity and ergodicity @xcite .",
    "verification of stationarity of the time series can be approached by quantile lines test , followed by checking ergodic behaviour @xcite to validate anomalous diffusion models of the data .",
    "these can be complemented by tests based on power spectra of farima model @xcite .",
    "while so far we have based our conclusions on fairly simple properties of the experimental data , there are indications of their non - stationarity .",
    "these issues are a starting point for our further research .",
    "altogether , our investigations of long - range correlations present in the analysed time - series provide evidence that the best measure of discrimination between healthy sleepers and sleep - deficient group is obtained by examination of the cumulative ( survival ) distribution of resting periods . even though period durations are limited by the time resolution of an actigraph and the night length ,",
    "the survival distribution in a resting state exhibits approximately a power - law scaling which is robust over two decades .",
    "significantly higher values of the exponent @xmath118 for sleep - deprived subjects signal less heavy tails of waiting - time distributions in an immobile ( resting ) state than in an analogous distribution for the control group and can be associated with restlessness / inquietude and increased variability ( burstiness ) of activity in recorded time series .",
    "consequently , those alterations of locomotor pattern can be informative about mood / behaviour disturbances related to sleep deficiency and possibly , used as a valuable diagnostic fingerprint discriminating between healthy and depressed / disordered individuals .",
