    "the investigation of the effects of external magnetic and electric fields on atomic spectra is an important activity in atomic physics .",
    "many theoretical and experimental studies have been made to understand the energy - level structure of rydberg atoms in magnetic , electric and combined electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , most studies were performed for only one of the two fields or for the special cases of parallel or perpendicular orientations of the electric and magnetic field vectors .",
    "many studies of the effects of magnetic fields were performed using strong fields , for which the diamagnetic contribution is dominant , starting with the early work of jenkins and segr @xcite and the discovery of quasi - landau resonances by garton and tomkins @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the diamagnetism of na rydberg states by high - resolution spectroscopy and analyzed in detail the magnetic - field dependence of the level structure from the low to the high field regime .",
    "the effects of high magnetic fields were also explored experimentally in the rydberg states of other atoms , including barium @xcite , helium @xcite , rubidium @xcite and hydrogen in the quasi - landau regime @xcite .",
    "_    the pure stark effect was also studied in numerous rydberg atoms , including the alkali and alkaline - earth metal atoms @xcite and the rare gases @xcite and in molecules @xcite .",
    "early experiments on rydberg states in parallel electric and magnetic fields were performed in lithium @xcite , hydrogen @xcite and helium @xcite .",
    "these studies also presented complete analyses of the observed structures , from which resulted a detailed understanding of the relevant physical processes and a classification of the rydberg states according to different types of behaviour in the fields . in all cases , excellent agreement between measured and calculated spectra was obtained .",
    "recently , the rydberg spectrum of rb was studied in the presence of strong magnetic and weak parallel electric fields in the @xmath0-mixing regime , with the goal of preparing states of large dipole moments and large optical excitation cross sections for possible applications in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "an experimental study of rydberg states of h in strong perpendicular magnetic and electric fields was reported by weibusch _",
    "et al . @xcite .",
    "the effect of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields was also examined in rydberg states of rubidium @xcite , sodium @xcite and barium @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms in strong perpendicular electric and magnetic fields are of interest because they exhibit a potential energy surface for the electron motion that has two minima @xcite .",
    "a narrow and deep potential well is centered at the nucleus and arises from the coulomb interaction , whereas a shallower well occurs at large distances from the nucleus .",
    "the first experimental evidence of a field - induced potential minimum at large distances was reported by fauth _",
    "@xcite following observation of the large electric dipole moment associated with these states .",
    "rydberg atoms in strong perpendicular electric and magnetic fields are also of interest for studying the quantum - mechanical properties of systems for which the corresponding classical behaviour is chaotic @xcite , which is the case when the interactions with the external fields become comparable in strength to the coulomb interaction @xcite . _",
    "_    only a few theoretical studies have been devoted to the behaviour of rydberg atoms in electric and magnetic fields with arbitrary relative orientations .",
    "calculations for weak external fields using perturbation theory were reported in @xcite and the effects of strong electric and magnetic fields were studied in @xcite . in their theoretical study of the hydrogen atom in combined electric and magnetic fields with arbitrary relative orientations , main _ et al .",
    "@xcite predicted large avoided crossings between eigenstates of the same approximately conserved @xmath0 values , a phenomenon which was interpreted as a quantum manifestation of intramanifold chaos . _    our motivation to study the spectrum of rydberg states of he in electric and magnetic fields with arbitrary relative orientations originated in experiments in which we seek to develop a new trap - loading scheme for cold paramagnetic atoms and molecules in supersonic beams relying on rydberg - stark deceleration and trapping @xcite .",
    "the strategy we follow to increase the density of cold trapped atoms and molecules consists of first decelerating and deflecting the rydberg atoms using a rydberg - stark decelerator @xcite , loading the atoms in an off - axis electric trap and waiting for them to radiatively decay to the ground or a metastable state , i.e. , the 1s2s @xmath6s@xmath7 = 2 @xmath6s@xmath7 state in the case of he .",
    "superimposing a magnetic trap on the electric trap would enable us to increase the density of trapped atoms at each cycle of our experimental procedure .",
    "a similar strategy , but based on multistage stark deceleration rather than rydberg - stark deceleration , has been pursued to trap nh molecules @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the distributions of electric ( red arrows ) and magnetic ( blue arrows ) fields in the overlaid electric and magnetic traps .",
    "the electric trap is generated by four electrodes in quadrupole configuration , and the magnetic trap , with a field minimum at the centre of the electric trap , is created by two permanent magnets placed above and below the plane of the figure .",
    "atoms trapped in such electric- and magnetic - field distributions experience all possible relative orientations between the electric- and magnetic - field vectors . whereas the weak electric fields we use for trapping ( @xmath8 v / cm , see figure 1 ) will not influence the behaviour of the ground state or metastable states accumulating in the trap",
    ", one can anticipate that the magnetic fields of up to 50 mt will influence the rydberg - stark deceleration and trapping processes .",
    "the success of rydberg - stark deceleration and trapping experiments critically depends on the ability to carry out realistic particle - trajectory simulations and these in turn require a good knowledge of the field dependence of the energy levels .",
    "the purpose of the study presented in this article is to develop and validate efficient procedures to compute the energy - level structure of rydberg atoms ( and molecules ) in electric and magnetic fields of arbitrary relative orientation .",
    "spectroscopic studies of rydberg states of he in magnetic , electric and combined magnetic and electric fields with arbitrary relative orientations are presented here as a necessary step in our overall strategy .",
    "procedures to compute rydberg spectra in pure electric fields , pure magnetic fields , and parallel and perpendicular electric and magnetic fields are well established , as reviewed above .",
    "we nevertheless chose to present such spectra because ( 1 ) pure stark and zeeman spectra are essential to calibrate the field strengths by comparison between experimental and computed spectra , ( 2 ) the field strengths themselves are crucial to accurately set the angle between electric and magnetic fields , and ( 3 ) spectra recorded for parallel and perpendicular electric and magnetic fields are useful , as limiting cases , in the validation of the procedure devised to calculate spectra for arbitrary angles between the electric- and magnetic - field vectors .",
    "schematic diagram of the overlaid electric and magnetic quadrupole trap with the magnetic ( blue arrows ) and electric ( red arrows ) field distribution in the central plane .",
    "the electric trapping fields are generated by applying @xmath9 v to the four parallel cylindrical metallic rods used as electrodes in a quadrupolar arrangement .",
    "the quadrupolar magnetic - field distribution is created by two permanent magnets in north - north configuration positioned in the center of the four electrodes above and below the plane of the figure , as indicated by the dashed circle .",
    "the maximal sizes of the red and blue arrows correspond to 250 v / cm and 47 mt , respectively . ]    at the @xmath0 values around 30 used and the typical fields of 0 - 250 v / cm and 0 - 50 mt relevant for our planned trapping schemes , the stark and zeeman interactions are much below the range where quantum chaos is expected .",
    "these interactions can be adequately treated by perturbation theory , which is the approach we follow in the analysis of our spectra . because adiabatic transitions between rydberg states of different electric dipole moments have an adverse effect on the deceleration and trapping efficiency , emphasis is placed on the characterization of avoided crossings between the rydberg states in energy - level maps in which the energy eigenvalues are plotted as a function of the electric field , the magnetic field , and the angle between the field vectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains the descriptions of the experimental setup and the method of calculating the spectra of rydberg helium in external fields .",
    "the experimental spectra are presented and discussed in section 3 , where they are also compared with calculated spectra .",
    "the discussion starts with the simplest case of rydberg helium spectra measured in pure magnetic and pure electric fields , continues with the special cases of parallel and perpendicular fields and ends with the general case of fields with arbitrary relative orientation .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in section 4 .",
    "a schematic view of the experimental setup is presented in figure 2 .",
    "a cold supersonic beam of helium is formed by expanding pure he gas into vacuum from a reservoir held at a stagnation pressure of 2.5 bar using a pulsed valve .",
    "the valve is cooled to 130 k with liquid nitrogen , resulting in a beam velocity of 1200 m / s .",
    "triplet 2 @xmath6s@xmath7 helium ( called metastable he or he * hereafter ) is produced in an electric discharge in the high - pressure region at the exit of the nozzle , as described in @xcite . after passing a skimmer ,",
    "the he * atoms enter a photoexcitation and ionization region surrounded by four parallel cylindrically - symmetric electrodes and by two pairs of coils in helmholtz configuration .",
    "the separation between the outer two electrodes in the stack is 1.5 cm and the four electrodes are equally spaced .",
    "the inner two electrodes are used to ensure the homogeneity of the electric field in the photoexcitation region . to generate magnetic fields perpendicular ( parallel ) to the electric field ,",
    "two coils are used with a center - to - center distance of 50 mm ( 33 mm ) and inner and outer radii of 84 ( 44.5 ) and 114.6 ( 75.1 ) mm , respectively .",
    "the number of windings of each coil is 70 .",
    "the he * atoms are excited to rydberg states using a pulsed ( repetition rate 25 hz , pulse duration @xmath103 ns , pulse energy 150 @xmath11j ) narrow - band ( full width at half maximum 150 mhz ) uv laser with a wavelength tunable in the region between 260.41 and 260.88 nm for transitions from the 2 @xmath6s@xmath7 state to rydberg states with @xmath0 between 30 and 45 . to generate the uv laser radiation , a continuous - wave single - mode tunable ir diode laser ( power 30 mw , wavelength 782 nm ) is pulse amplified using three successive dye cells operated with the dye styryl 11 and pumped with the second harmonic ( 532 nm ) of a nd : yag laser .",
    "the output ( 1 mj / pulse ) of the dye amplification stages is frequency doubled with a bbo crystal , and the doubled light , with a wavelength of @xmath10391 nm , is mixed in another bbo crystal with the fundamental ir laser output to get the desired uv radiation .",
    "the vacuum wavenumber of the uv laser radiation is determined from the wavenumber of the ir radiation , which is measured using a wavemeter ( accuracy 3@xmath12 200 mhz ) .",
    "the he rydberg atoms ( _ n = 30 or 45 ) are detected by field ionization with a pulsed electric field of 2 kv / cm , which also extracts the he@xmath13 ions toward a detector consisting of a pair of microchannel plates in chevron configuration .",
    "the joint effects of the laser bandwidth and doppler broadening led to single transitions having full widths at half maximum of 0.007 @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , all calculated stick spectra were convoluted with a gaussian line - shape function of 0.007 @xmath14 .",
    "_    figure 2 schematically illustrates the relative orientations of the molecular beam , the laser beam , the laser polarization ( @xmath15 ) , the axis of the cylindrically symmetric electrode stack used to generate the electric field ( @xmath16 ) and the axes of the two solenoid pairs used to produce the magnetic fields ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . the atomic beam propagates in a direction parallel to the electric field .",
    "the magnetic field can be produced at arbitrary angle to the electric field in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 plane by adjusting the currents flowing through the two pairs of coils .",
    "when the magnetic - field vector points parallel to the he * beam and the he@xmath13 flight axis ( @xmath20 axis in figure 2 ) , the lorentz force does not deflect the ions .",
    "consequently , the maximal value of the magnetic field in @xmath20 direction is only limited by the current that can be applied to the coils , i.e. , 200 a , corresponding to @xmath21 mt . when the magnetic field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the ion flight axis , the lorentz force deflects the ions , which makes it impossible to record spectra for @xmath22 mt .    the laser polarization used for the experiments",
    "is chosen so as to be predominantly perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields , implying the selection rule @xmath23 for the transition from the 2 @xmath6s@xmath7 state to the rydberg states . in some experiments ,",
    "the laser polarization was slightly tilted ( less than 5@xmath24 ) , so that the @xmath4 = 0 component in the pure zeeman spectra and the 31s level in the pure stark spectra and the spectra recorded for parallel fields could also be observed .",
    "the effects of the slightly tilted polarization on the spectra recorded in combined electric and magnetic fields are too weak to be observed .",
    "the calibration of the magnetic field is performed by measuring the zeeman splitting for a range of currents applied to the two pairs of coils and determining the relationship between current and magnetic field for each pair of coils separately .",
    "since the beam velocity is parallel to the applied electric field , the motional zeeman effect is zero .",
    "the motional stark effect resulting from the magnetic - field component perpendicular to the beam propagation axis is 0.09 v / cm for @xmath3 = 8 mt and is negligible compared to the typical electric - field strengths used in this work .",

    "this situation corresponds to the paschen - back regime , which describes the @xmath0 = 30 and 45 rydberg states of he explored in this work accurately , because the spin - orbit interaction is very weak in a light atom such as he and scales as @xmath55 .",
    "the paschen - back regime and the selection rules @xmath56 , @xmath57 allow us to ignore the spin part of the hamiltonian .",
    "all spectra presented in this article were recorded in the regime where the magnetic interaction is much weaker than the coulomb interaction but at the same time much stronger than the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the spectra for magnetic - field strengths beyond 100 mt were calculated using hamiltonian ( 1 ) but disregarding the electron spin .",
