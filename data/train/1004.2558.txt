    "in qcd phase diagram , the first order phase transition boundary separates the two phases : the hadron gas and the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) .",
    "the critical point(cp ) which locates at the end of the transition boundary , is a distinct singular feature of qcd phase diagram@xcite . to map the components of the qcd phase diagram",
    "is one of the main goals of heavy - ion physics , and searching for the critical point has been addressed in both theoretical and experimental studies@xcite , all these works help us to gather information of the singularities near the cp .",
    "if the cp existence around @xmath4300mev@xcite it can be studied by heavy ion experiments , like bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with its beam energy scan ( bes ) program@xcite , cern super proton synchrotron ( sps)@xcite and the future gsi facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair)@xcite .    the fluctuations of conserved quantities , like net baryon number , electric charge and strangeness , are considered to be sensitive indicators for the structure of created system  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of a cp is the diverge of the fluctuations .",
    "most proposed fluctuation of observables are variations of @xmath5 order moments of the distribution , such as particle ratio  @xcite , charged dynamical  @xcite and @xmath6-measure  @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that all these observables are proportional to approximately @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 is the correlation length which will diverges at the cp .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that @xmath9 fm for heavy ion collision  @xcite , thus , it is extremely difficult to measure in experiments .",
    "however , the recent results shown that higher moments of conserved quantities distribution are more sensitive to cp due to their strong dependence on @xmath8 , the @xmath10 order moment skewness@xmath11 while the @xmath12 order moment kurtosis@xmath13  @xcite . also the product kurtosis@xmath3 ( called @xmath14 in reference  @xcite ) which is equal to the ratio of @xmath12 order to @xmath15 order susceptibilities shows a large deviation from unity near the cp by lattice calculations and qcd based model studies  @xcite .    studying the event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite is an effective way to address fluctuations of a system created in a heavy ion collision  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present the study of higher moments as a function of evolution time , and we will discuss the acceptance effect on higher moments of net baryon distribution .",
    "monte carlo event generators , ampt and urqmd , have been used in this study .",
    "a multi - phase transport(ampt ) model is made up by four main parts : the initial conditions , partonic interactions , hadronization and hadronic rescattering .",
    "the initial conditions , which include the spatial and momentum distributions of minijet partons and soft string excitations , are obtained from the heavy ion jet interaction generator(hijing ) model  @xcite .",
    "scatterings between partons are modeled by zhang s parton cascade(zpc )  @xcite , which presently includes only two - body scatterings with cross sections obtained from the pqcd with screening masses . in the default ampt model(abbr .",
    "`` ampt default '' )  @xcite , partons are recombined with their parent strings when they stop interacting , and the resulting strings are converted to hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model  @xcite . in the ampt model with string melting(abbr .",
    "`` ampt stringmelting '' )  @xcite , the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is achieved by a simple coalescence model , which combines two quarks into mesons and three quarks into baryons  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ampt model use hadronic cascade , which is based on the a relativistic transport(art ) model  @xcite , to describe the dynamics of the subsequent hadronic matter .",
    "final results from the ampt model are obtained after hadronic interactions are terminated at a cutoff time @xmath16 . when setting the time - step(in @xmath17 ) for hadron cascade to 0.2 ( default value ) , the termination time of hadron cascade @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the number of time - steps , the default setting is @xmath20 .",
    "when the time - step is fixed , larger @xmath19 means longer time of hadron rescatterings .",
    "note @xmath19 lets all resonance rapidly decay(less than @xmath21 ) and turns off hadronic interactions effectively . in this paper",
    ", we measure the fluctuation which belongs to different processes : scenario ( a)``parton '' is a process between zpc and quark coalescence , it still locates in the partonic phase , scenario ( b)``w / o art '' is the time that hadronization(or quark coalescence ) has finished , it is in hadronic phase but no hadron cascade happens , scenario ( c)and ( d)are originated from different termination time @xmath16 , by setting different @xmath20 value we can control the hadronic process in the simulated heavy ion collisions .",
    "it helps us to understand the hadronic effect on the observable . in order to investigate different effects in time evolution",
    ", we will study the fluctuation of higher moments in each process . comparing the measured value from different processes",
    ", we can study whether the fluctuation of the higher moment can provide the information from the early stage of the collisions .",
    "the ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model  @xcite is also been used in this paper .",
    "it is a microscopic transport theory based on the covariant propagation of all hadrons on classical trajectories in combination with stochastic binary scatterings , color string formation and resonance decay .",
    "the urqmd model represents a monte carlo solution of a large set of coupled partial integro - differential equations for the time evolution of the various phase space densities @xmath22 of different species of particles . in the input file",
    ", one can control the time to propagate and output time - interval ( in fm / c ) , in this paper we set the time to propagate is 40 fm / c and the time - interval is 2 @xmath17 .",
    "more detail descriptions can be found in ref .",
    "in experiments , neutrons can not be detected , and the reconstruction efficiency is relatively low for strange hadrons , especially for multi - strange hadrons , such as @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , theoretical calculation suggests that the proton number is a meaningful observable for the purpose of detecting the cp in heavy ion experiments  @xcite , its fluctuation completely reflect the singularity of the baryon number susceptibility .",
    "thus , only if the measurements from net baryon and net proton distribution are similar , we can searching for the cp by measuring the fluctuation of various moments of net proton distribution .",
    "[ sect_discuss ]    -2.0 cm     observables that can reflect real dynamics and have little influence on the finite acceptance , are worth exploring from the theoretical point of view  @xcite . due to the limited acceptances in experiments ,",
    "it is necessary to study the acceptance effect by monte calor model . in the previous work  @xcite",
    ", we presented that the skewness and kurtosis have little influence on the size of rapidity windows and transverse momentum regions , they could be good candidate for searching the cp in experiments .",
    "firstly , we study the transverse momentum window cut effect on higher moments .",
    "figure 1 shows the centrality dependence of kurtosis of net - proton , net - cbaryon , net - baryon distribution at @xmath0 gev by ampt stringmelting .",
    "the transverse momentum window are 0@xmath250.4 ( @xmath26 ) , 0.4@xmath250.8 ( @xmath27 ) and 0.8@xmath251.2 ( @xmath26 ) , respectively .",
    "the only difference between net - baryon and net - cbaryon is that net - cbaryon excludes neutrons . as we presented before  @xcite",
    ", the kurtosis has a decreasing trend from peripheral to central collision .",
    "the value of kurtosis approaches to zero in the central collisions , it means that these distributions are more similar to gaussian distribution .",
    "based on discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite , kurtosis can be scaled by @xmath28 , if kurtosis deviate from this @xmath28 scaling curve and exhibit a non - monotonic behavior , it would indicate the new physics which is related to cp .    as shown in each panel of fig .",
    "1 , the results from net - proton , net - cbaryon and net - baryon are almost consistent with each other , especially in the central collisions . at the same time",
    ", the trends of kurtosis in three transverse momentum windows seems similar , it suggests kurtosis has little dependence on the chosen transverse momentum window . together with the previous results of windows size dependence  @xcite",
    ", we argue that kurtosis is independent on acceptance .",
    "we also calculate the transverse momentum window cut effect on skewness and find that skewness is an observable which does not depend on acceptance .    as an ideal observable for the signatures of cp",
    ", it should be only sensitive to the early stage of the collisions .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the behavior of these observables as a function of evolution time . in fig .",
    "2 we study the kurtosis of net - proton , net - cbaryon , net - baryon distributions as a function of evolution time by urqmd model .",
    "the measured values of kurtosis of net - baryon , net - cbaryon and net - proton distribution keep a constant .",
    "the results suggest that the kurtosis of the net - baryon distribution in the final state can reflect the distribution of the early stage .",
    "most importantly , the system s evolution does not affect the signature .",
    "based on the urqmd model calculation , we find the kurtosis can provide the information of the signature of the early stage . with ampt stringmelting , we can illustrate different effects on kurtosis in time evolution clearly . in fig .",
    "3 we study the kurtosis as a function of centralities in scenario ( a)parton , ( b)w / o art , ( c)@xmath20 = 3 , ( d)@xmath20 = 150 with @xmath29(@xmath26 ) and @xmath30 at @xmath2 = 17.3 gev , respectively . from scenario ( a ) to ( b ) , the system experiences the hadronization process . comparing panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "3 , we find the kurtosis of the distributions originate from early partonic phase , the quark coalescence - like hadronization almost does nt affect kurtosis .    in ampt stringmelting ,",
    "the hadron cascade procedure is regarded as two processes , resonance decay and hadron rescattering . from scenario ( b ) w / o art to scenario ( c ) @xmath20 = 3 , the system experiences the resonance decay process .",
    "4 is the particles yield in different evolution time in central collision at @xmath2 = 17.3 gev by ampt stringmelting .",
    "we can find all resonances decay before @xmath31 and the certain particle yield does nt change after @xmath20 = 3 . here",
    "the yield is the ratio of a certain particle number to the total particles number .",
    "when we compare panel ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "3 , it seems that the resonance decay process does nt affect kurtosis .",
    "on the other hand , large hadron rescattering effect may destroy the fluctuation which originates from the early stage of heavy ion collision .",
    "this effect depends on two factors : one is the time that particles go through the collision region , the other is the density in the collision region  @xcite . in ampt stringmelting",
    ", we can study the hadron rescattering effect on higher moments by controlling the termination time of hadron cascade(@xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath20 = 3 is regarded as that there is no hadron rescattering , while @xmath33 = 150 is corresponding to termination time of 30 @xmath17 . from panel ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "3 , it suggests the observed value of kurtosis nearly does not change and almost keeps the same trend , even though the system experiences full hadronic rescatterings .",
    "it is reasonably to conclude that hadron rescatterings do not have clear influence on kurtosis .    besides kurtosis and skewness",
    ", the product of kurtosis and variance ( kurtosis@xmath3 ) of the net - baryon distribution has also been used to search for the cp .",
    "this observable is related to the ratio of quartic ( @xmath12 order ) and quadratic ( @xmath15 order ) cumulates of baryon number susceptibilities .",
    "lattice qcd and some qcd based model  @xcite predicted that the fluctuation of kurtosis@xmath1 changed rapidly at the transition temperature @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , it is predicted that baryon number susceptibilities will diverge when close to the cp , this will bring about the deviation of kurtosis@xmath3 from being constant .",
    "all of the works argue that kurtosis@xmath3 is a worthful observable .",
    "however , as we presented before  @xcite , the kurtosis@xmath3 is dependent on the acceptance , namely , lager acceptance lead to smaller measured value .",
    "also , as shown in fig . 5 , results of kurtosis@xmath3 of net - baryon distribution from two versions of ampt model have a strong dependence on the collision energy , it is quite different from net - proton distribution . this difference may due to baryon stopping effect in low energy region .",
    "the similar result can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite by urqmd calculation .",
    "in this paper we study fluctuation of higher moments of net - baryon distriubtion with ampt and urqmd models . based on these results , we find the higher moments of net - baryon distribution are independent on the chosen transverse momentum window . together with the previous results of rapidity and transverse momentum windows size dependence ,",
    "we conclude that kurtosis and skewness are independent on acceptance .",
    "we also study the time evolution effects and late hadronic effects on higher moments of net - baryon distribution in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev with urqmd and ampt model .",
    "the results seem that quark coalescence hadronization process , resonances decay process and hadronic rescatterings do nt affect the trend and value of kurtosis and skewness as a function of centralities .",
    "thus , they should be good oberservables to searching for the possible critical point predicted by qcd , non monotonic behaviors of the kurtosis and skewness as a function of beam energy or centrality will demonstrate the existence of a cp .",
    "the kurtosis@xmath3 of net - proton distribution show great difference to that of net - baryon distribution when collisions energy is lower than @xmath2 = 20 gev , it deviates from the theoretical predictions .    in the future , the rhic beam energy scan and gsi facility for antiproton and ion research will provide the possibility to locate the critical point in experiment .",
    "higher moments of net - baryon distribution should be one of the powerful tools .",
