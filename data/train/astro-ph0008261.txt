    "discovered over 25 years ago ( balick & brown 1974 ) , sgr a@xmath2 is a bright , compact radio source coincident with the dynamical center of the galaxy , and now provides possibly the most compelling evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes .",
    "the suggested central dark mass concentration within the inner 0.015 pc of the galactic center is @xmath3 ( genzel et al .",
    "1996 ; eckart & genzel 1996 ; eckart & genzel 1997 ; ghez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "( 0.1@xmath4 corresponds to 800 astronomical units , or roughly @xmath5 cm at a distance of 8.5 kpc . )",
    "most of this mass is probably associated with sgr a*.    the spectrum of this unusual object is seen to be bumpy , but can be described as a power - law with a spectral index @xmath6 that varies between roughly @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) between ghz and mm wavelengths .",
    "however , one of the most interesting features currently under focus is the suggestion of a sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) bump in the spectrum ( zylka et al . 1992 ; zylka et al .",
    "1995 ) , since in all emission models the highest frequencies correspond to the smallest spatial scales , so that the sub - millimeter emission comes directly from the vicinity of the black hole ( melia 1992 , 1994 ; melia , jokipii & narayanan 1992 ; coker and melia 2000 ) .",
    "the existence of this bump ( or `` excess '' ) has been uncertain due to the variability of sgr a * , but is now well established following a set of simultaneous observations ( from @xmath920 cm to @xmath91 mm ) using the vla , bima , nobeyama 45 m , & iram 30 m telescopes ( falcke , et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "more recently , radio observations of sgr a * have focused on the detection of polarization from this source .",
    "although the upper limits to the linear polarization in sgr a * are found to be quite low ( less than @xmath10 ) below 86 ghz ( bower et al . 1999 ) , this is not the case at 750 , 850 , 1350 , and 2000 @xmath11 m , where a surprisingly large intrinsic polarization of over @xmath12 has now been reported ( aitken , et al . 2000 ) .",
    "> from the lack of polarization at longer wavelengths , aitken et al .",
    "conclude that their measured values at higher frequencies must arise in the mm / sub - mm `` excess '' .",
    "these observations also point to the tantalizing result that the position angle changes considerably ( by about @xmath13 ) between the mm and the sub - mm portions of the spectrum , which one would think must surely have something to do with the fact that the emitting gas becomes transparent at sub - mm wavelengths ( melia 1992 , 1994 ) .    in a companion paper ( melia , liu & coker 2001 ) we suggested that the mm and sub - mm `` excess '' in the spectrum of sgr a * may be the first indirect evidence for the anticipated circularization of the gas falling into the black hole at @xmath1 , where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the abundance of gas in the environment surrounding sgr a * clearly points to accretion as the incipient cause of the ensuing energetic behavior of this source ( melia 1994)whether or not it eventually leads to expulsion of some plasma at smaller radii ( see , e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "1993 ) . in their simulation of the bondi - hoyle accretion onto sgr",
    "a * from the surrounding winds , coker & melia ( 1997 ) concluded the accreted specific angular momentum @xmath15 can vary by @xmath16 over @xmath17 200 years with an average equilibrium value in @xmath9 of about @xmath18 or less .",
    "although this shows that relatively little specific angular momentum is accreted  so that large disks ( such as those required in adaf models ; narayan et al .",
    "1996 ) probably do not form around sgr a*it does nonetheless lead to the expectation that the plasma must circularize toward smaller radii before flowing through the event horizon . however , given the fluctuations in the accreted value of @xmath9 ( both in magnitude and sign ! ) , this keplerian flow is variable , and it probably dissolves and reforms ( possibly with a different sense of spin ) on a time scale of @xmath19 years or less .",
    "melia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated how this dichotomy comprising a quasi - spherical flow at radii beyond @xmath20 or so , and a keplerian structure toward smaller radii , may be the explanation for sgr a * s spectrum , including the appearance of the `` excess '' , which is viewed as arising primarily within the circularized component .",
    "it is our intention in this _",
    "letter _ to demonstrate how the linear polarization data may now be taken as direct evidence for the existence of this accretion profile .",
    "the structure of the flow within the circularization radius ( at @xmath21 ) is developed fully in melia et al .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we highlight the key elements of this calculation below .",
    "central to the modeling of the sub - mm `` excess '' is the supposition that within the keplerian flow , a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo produces an enhanced ( though still sub - equipartition ) magnetic field , dominated by its azimuthal component ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "although the process of magnetic field dissipation suppresses the field intensity well below its equipartition value in the quasi - spherical region ( kowalenko & melia 2000 ) , the magnetic dynamo evidently overwhelms the rate of field destruction in the differentially rotating portion of the inflow , and the field reaches a saturated intensity .",
    "the sub - mm `` excess '' in sgr a * may be the thermal synchrotron radiation produced in this inner region .    at a ( cylindrical ) radius @xmath22 in the keplerian flow where the column density is @xmath23 and the angular velocity is @xmath24 ,",
    "the radial velocity is given as ( e.g. , stoeger 1980 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath27 is the vertically integrated sum of the maxwell and reynolds stresses ( balbus et al . 1994 ) .",
    "for the problem at hand , the maxwell stress dominates , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the turbulent magnetic field ( the average inside the integral being taken over time ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , by brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ) show that @xmath30 changes very slowly with @xmath22 . in the particular cases considered by these authors",
    ", @xmath30 ranged in value from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , while @xmath22 decreased by a factor of @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    ", we will here adopt a `` mean '' value of @xmath34 for this quantity .    for steady conditions , one can obtain the vertical profile by assuming that the gas is in local hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "balancing gravity and the pressure gradient in the vertical direction , we obtain the scale height @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the gas temperature at radius r , @xmath37 is the gas constant , and @xmath11 is the molecular weight . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the keplerian flow is axisymmetric and is independent of the vertical coordinate .",
    "written another way , we have @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the gas pressure and @xmath40 is the mass density of the gas . the numerical simulations of the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo effect indicate that the field intensity is somewhat below its equipartition value , so that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is roughly constant with a value of @xmath43 . thus , with @xmath44 , we can integrate equation ( [ vr ] ) to obtain @xmath45 , and @xmath36 follows directly from the energy conservation equation ( melia et al 2001 ) .",
    "the flux density ( at earth ) produced by the keplerian portion of the flow is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 kpc is the distance to the galactic center , @xmath48 is the observed frequency at infinity and @xmath49 is the frequency measured by a stationary observer in the schwarzschild frame .",
    "( for simplicity , we here assume the metric for a non - spinning black hole . a more thorough exploration of the parameter values , including the black hole spin , will be discussed elsewhere . )",
    "the frequency transformations are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the frequency measured in the co - moving frame , and @xmath52 is the angle between the velocity @xmath53 and the line of sight .",
    "since the radial velocity is always much smaller than @xmath54 , we ignore this component in the transformation equations .",
    "so @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the inclination angle of the axis perpendicular to the keplerian flow , and @xmath57 is the azimuth of the emitting element .",
    "when the doppler shift is included , the blue shifted region is located primarily near @xmath58 while the red shifted region is at @xmath59 .",
    "the other quantities that are necessary for an evaluation of the flux density are the area element @xmath60 , and the specific intensity @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and the optical depth is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the absorption coefficient .",
    "when @xmath65 , kirchoff s law allows us to write @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the emissivity .",
    "the presence of a substantial azimuthal component of the magnetic field makes it convenient to calculate the observed flux directly from the extraordinary and ordinary components of the intensity .",
    "the most convenient approach is to select the symmetry axis of the keplerian flow as the reference direction .",
    "the observed flux densities in the azimuthal and the reference directions are given by @xmath68 respectively , where @xmath69 is the position angle of the magnetic field vector within the emitting element that has an azimuth of @xmath57 , so that @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the specific intensities for the extraordinary and ordinary waves , respectively . for thermal synchrotron",
    "radiation , the emissivities are @xmath73\\ de\\ , \\label{com1 } \\\\",
    "\\epsilon^o&= & { \\sqrt{3 } e^3\\over 8\\pi m_e c^2 } b \\sin{\\theta^\\prime } \\int_0^\\infty n(e)[f(x)-g(x)]\\ de\\ ; , \\label{com2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the electron distribution function at energy @xmath75 , and @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the corresponding modified bessel functions ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "the total flux density produced by the keplerian portion of the flow is the sum of these two .",
    "the expected fractional polarization is then given by @xmath79 .",
    "the temperature in this region reaches @xmath80 k , for which inverse compton processes must be taken into account .",
    "the self - comptonization of the sub - mm radiation is calculated according to the prescription in melia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , based on the algorithm described in melia & fatuzzo ( 1989 ) .",
    "the best - fit model for the polarized mm and sub - mm emission from sgr a * ( aitken et al . 2000 ) is shown in figures 1 ( the inset ) and ( the solid curve of ) 2 .",
    "the peak frequency of the flux density is @xmath81 hz , and the flip frequency ( at which the position angle changes by @xmath82 ) is @xmath83 hz . below this frequency , the first component is smaller than the second , and the corresponding percentage polarization is therefore ( by definition ) negative . above the flip frequency ,",
    "the first component is larger .",
    "although the fit is not optimized , both the spectrum and the percentage polarization appear to be consistent with the data .",
    "it is to be noted that the peak frequency is actually _ smaller _ than the flip frequency , which is distinct from other models that may also produce a rotation of the position angle ( see aitken et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "it is rather straightforward to understand the polarization characteristics in this model . in the optically thick region ( below about @xmath84",
    "hz ) , the specific intensity of the extraordinary and ordinary waves is almost isotropic in the co - moving frame because the optical depth @xmath85 is very large . even with the inclusion of the doppler effect , the emissivity of the source is relatively independent of position angle .",
    "but the optical depths are different for the two waves , as indicated by equation ( [ depth ] ) , and the specific intensity of the extraordinary wave is slightly larger than that of the ordinary wave . from equations ( [ com1 ] ) and ( [ com2 ] ) , we see that the second component is larger than the first , and the percentage polarization is therefore negative according to the definition of @xmath86 . with an increase in frequency ,",
    "the extraordinary amplitude becomes even larger ( relative to that of the ordinary wave ) and so the percentage polarization increases .",
    "however , in the optically thin region , the specific intensity is given by equation ( [ intensity2 ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity is very sensitive to the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field vector * b * ; synchrotron radiation is beamed into a plane perpendicular to * b * in the co - moving frame . with the inclusion of the doppler effect",
    ", the radiation is beamed into a cone , and the dominant contribution comes from the blue shifted region which has an azimuth of about zero .",
    "therefore , since the extraordinary wave is more intense than the ordinary wave and the integrals ( [ com1 ] ) and ( [ com2 ] ) are dominated by radiation from the emitting element with an azimuth of about zero , the first component is larger than the second . in this case , the fractional polarization becomes positive .    in other words ,",
    "the optically thick emission is dominated by emitting elements on the near and far sides of the black hole , for which the extraordinary wave has a polarization direction parallel to the reference axis .",
    "in contrast , the dominant contribution in the thin region comes from the blue shifted emitter to the side of the black hole , where the extraordinary wave has a polarization direction mostly perpendicular to this axis .",
    "the sharp decrease in polarization at still higher frequencies is due to the diluting effects of comptonization emission which begins to dominate over synchrotron emission at that point .",
    "the inclination angle dependence of the fractional polarization associated with emission by the keplerian portion of the inflow is shown in figure 2 .",
    "several issues remain to be investigated .",
    "an important result of our analysis is that only modest accretion rates appear to be consistent with the polarization characteristics of sgr a * at mm and sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the emitting region is compact  evidently no larger than a handful of schwarzschild radii . yet",
    "( coker & melia 1997 ) suggest that the rate at which plasma is captured at larger radii ( of order @xmath87 or so ) is several orders of magnitude higher",
    ". if our modeling is correct , this would seem to suggest that @xmath88 is variable , perhaps due to a gradual loss of mass with decreasing radius ( see , e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "it is essential to self - consistently match the conditions within the keplerian region of the flow with the quasi - spherical infall further out .",
    "these calculations are currently under way , and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in addition , if the _ chandra _ source is indeed the counterpart to sgr a * ( baganoff et al 2000 ) , then the spectrum shown in figure 1 suggests a correlated variability between the sub - mm and x - ray fluxes , which can be tested with the next round of coordinated observations .",
    "we are very grateful to marco fatuzzo for helpful discussions .",
