    "we obtained 1222 s2-meos2 trajectories from one _ escherichia coli _ ( _ e . coli _ ) cell ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the trajectories form a cylinder with hemispherical end caps , which is the typical shape of an _",
    "e. coli _ cell .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows two individual s2-meos2 trajectories which are confined to regions with radii of approximately 100 and 150  nm .",
    "this confinement is most likely due to the tethering of the 30s subunit to mrnas @xcite .        to investigate",
    "whether the diffusion of the small subunit is isotropic or not , we calculated the _",
    "x _ , _ y _  and _ z _  mean square displacements ( msds ) of the trajectories ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) . the msd curves plateau after 200  ms and the _ x _  and _ y _  msds are nearly identical , indicating that cellular confinement has a very small effect on s2-meos2 diffusion at this timescale .",
    "the _ z _  msd curve has a higher offset than the _ x _  and _ y _  msd curves but is otherwise very similar to these curves .",
    "the higher offset can be explained by the higher uncertainties of the _ z_-positions .",
    "the _ x _ , _ y _  and _ z _  apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by fitting lines to msds up to 100  ms are 0.04 , 0.04 and 0.06@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 , respectively . unlike the msds themselves , these coefficients are very similar since they are largely unaffected by the localization errors which mainly affect the offsets .    to further analyze the trajectories , we fitted cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) corresponding to one- , two- , and three - state diffusion models to the experimental cdf of 20-ms displacements ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that a one - state model is not sufficient in describing the data .",
    "the sum of the squared errors decrease two orders of magnitude when the number of states is increased from one to two but only a factor of two when the number of states is increased from two to three .",
    "this indicates that a model with two diffusion states is sufficient to explain the data .",
    "the apparent diffusion coefficient obtained from fitting the experimental cdf with a cdf corresponding to a one - state diffusion model is 0.07@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 .",
    "this apparent diffusion coefficient is higher than the apparent diffusion coefficients obtained from the initial slopes of the msd curves , @xmath5@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 , since it also includes the localization errors .    .",
    "error bars represent standard error of the means .",
    "all msd curves plateau after 200  ms .",
    "the _ x _  and _ y _  msds are nearly identical while the _ z _  msd curve has a higher offset than the _ x _  and _ y _  msd curves but is otherwise very similar to these curves .",
    "the _ x _ , _ y _  and _ z _  apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by fitting lines to the first 5 msds are 0.04 , 0.04 and 0.06@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 , respectively . ]    the apparent diffusion coefficients obtained from fitting the experimental cdf with a cdf corresponding to two diffusion states are @xmath6@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3  for the fast state and @xmath7@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3  for the slow state .",
    "when we take the localization errors into account we obtain @xmath8@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3  and @xmath9@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 .",
    "the occupancies of the two states are 54% for the fast state and 46% for the slow state .",
    "the diffusion states probably correspond to free 30s ribosomal subunits and translating 70s ribosomes .",
    "if this is the case , it implies that 54% of the small subunits are involved in translation under our experimental conditions .",
    "it should be noted that free s2-meos2 proteins in the cell diffuse too fast to be localized with 20-ms exposures .    .",
    "the cdf is fitted with two cdf models of brownian motion corresponding to one and two diffusion states .",
    "the sums of the squared errors are 0.4 and 0.004 , respectively . ]",
    "the 3d tracking reveals that the ribosomes move isotropically in _ x _ , _ y _  and _",
    "z_. this is advantageous since it implies that most information about ribosome movement can be extracted from diffusion along the bacterial long axis ( _ x _ ) alone .",
    "the advantage of studying diffusion along the long axis is that the diffusion in _ y _  and _ z _  will be spatially restricted by the membrane and possibly also the nucleoid .",
    "furthermore , the confinement in _ y _  will depend on the _ z_-position , which will always be the most inaccurate in a 3d imaging system based on astigmatism .    to check",
    "if the small subunit is excluded from parts of the cell , we constructed a super - resolution image from all independent s2-meos2 localizations in a 200-nm thick _",
    "z_-section of the cell ( see figure  [ fig:5 ] ) . s2-meos2 is excluded from certain parts of the cell , consistent with nucleoid exclusion .",
    "this effect has previously been observed by electron microscopy of fixed cells @xcite and super - resolution imaging of sra - meos2 @xcite .",
    "an ideal use of single - molecule tracking data is the determination of rates by which individual molecules go between different complexes with different diffusion properties . in our case",
    ", such states could for example correspond to free small subunits and translating 70s ribosomes .",
    "however , in our case , the average trajectory consists of 4 steps , corresponding to 80  ms , which implies that we would expect that less than 1% of the tracked ribosomes complete a round of translation within a trajectory , assuming that it would take at least 10  s to translate a typical open reading frame @xcite",
    ". the number of translation initiation events will be just as unlikely in a steady - state situation .",
    "therefore , in order to study the dynamics of translation initiation , elongation , termination and ribosome recycling using single - molecule tracking , the trajectories would have to span longer times .",
    "one way of achieving this is by spacing out the imaging events such that the molecules can be monitored for longer times at the same total exposures , since photobleaching is often the limiting factor .",
    "the disadvantage of spacing out the observation time points is that it is less certain that the same molecule is being tracked , _",
    "i.e. _ the molecule that is being imaged can photobleach in one frame while another molecule spontaneously photoconverts before the next imaging event .",
    "the rate of spontaneous photoconversion of an meos2 molecule is not known but can be considered to be very low .",
    "however , since there are so many ribosomes per cell ( @xmath425000 ) @xcite , the overall risk of spontaneous conversion under a time period corresponding to a translation cycle might be significant .    to conclude ,",
    "the 30s subunits are excluded from parts of the cell , consistent with nucleoid exclusion , the average apparent diffusion coefficient is 0.05@xmath1m@xmath2  s@xmath3 , and it appears that s2-meos2 diffuses in at least two different complexes that are likely to be free 30s subunits and translating ribosomes .",
    "the optical setup included a 405-nm photoconversion laser ( radius 405 - 50 , coherent ) , a 555-nm excitation laser ( gcl-150 - 555 , crystalaser ) , a cylindrical lens ( lj1516rm - a , thorlabs ) , an emccd camera ( du-897e - cs0-#bv , andor technology ) , an emission filter ( hq605/75 m , chroma technology ) , an excitation filter ( z550/20x , chroma technology ) , an image splitter ( optosplit ii , cairn research ) , an inverted microscope ( eclipse ti - e , nikon instruments ) , two dichroic mirrors ( z405rdc and z555rdc , chroma technology ) , two shutter drivers ( t132 and vmm - d3 , vincent associates ) and two shutters ( ls6t2 and ls6zm2 , vincent associates ) .",
    "metamorph 7.7.6.0 ( molecular devices ) was used to control the ls6t2 shutter , the camera and the microscope .",
    "the baseline offset and the standard deviation of the camera noise were determined by acquiring 200 images with 256  x  256 pixels at 50  hz with a closed shutter , and calculating and fitting a gaussian function to the experimental probability mass function of the intensities .",
    "the multiplication factor was determined by acquiring 200 images with 256  x  256 evenly illuminated pixels at 50  hz with a white paper placed in front of the objective , flattening them to correct for any unevenness in the illumination , and calculating and fitting a theoretical probability mass function of intensities to the experimental probability mass function of the intensities @xcite .",
    "the baseline offset , the multiplication factor and the quantum efficiency of the camera were used to convert the image intensities from counts to number of photons .",
