    "it has long been known that nearby galaxies roughly fall into two categories : 1 ) systems with prominent disks often exhibiting spiral structure and ongoing star formation , and 2 ) galaxies dominated by a spheroidal morphology ",
    "the most extreme being ellipticals  and harboring little if any star formation . with the advent of large galaxy surveys like sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "it had been possible to quantify the bimodal nature of the local population both in terms of morphology and star formation as a function of what appears to be the best observationally accessible variable for separating the two populations , the galaxy s stellar mass ( @xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bimodal nature of the galaxy population is apparent to @xmath0 @xcite and beyond ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is clear that the fraction of galaxies populating either side must evolve with time .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for an increase since @xmath0 in the global mass density of morphological spheroidals at the expense of star - forming irregulars , and @xcite showed that increasingly @xmath4-band luminous and therefore more massive galaxies exhibit higher specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) at early times .    a number of more recent studies have confirmed and extended these early results , using mass and luminosity functions to trace the evolution since @xmath5 of the two populations as partitioned by the amount of star formation or the rest - frame color @xcite and as a function of morphological type @xcite .",
    "the importance of environmental density has also been studied .",
    "the emerging picture is one in which , beginning at the highest masses , galaxies transform from blue , star - forming , disk - dominated systems into red , bulge - dominated spheroidals in which star formation has been quenched . as time proceeds , this transformation process works its way down the mass function , driving the apparent downward shift in the bimodality mass scale .",
    "understanding the physical driver of this evolution has been a key challenge , leading to a search for a process capable of simultaneously shutting down star formation and turning disks into spheroidals .",
    "morphological evolution has often been attributed to the `` merger hypothesis '' @xcite , in which galaxy mergers convert rotation - supported disks into pressure - supported spheroids . in a series of papers , hopkins and",
    "collaborators demonstrate the feasibility of this idea through detailed simulations and link mergers with an explosive quasar or starburst phase that may heat or drive out cold gas in the spheroidal merger remnant , thereby quenching star formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the idea that mergers quench star formation , at least in halos above a critical mass , @xmath6 ( where the cooling time is longer than the dynamical time , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has also been implemented in semi - analytic models , in which supposedly spheroidal merger remnants are kept `` red and dead '' by so - called `` radio mode '' active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue against the need for mergers and agn feedback , relying instead on the interplay between shock heating and cold flows in halos near @xmath7 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "semi - analytic models based on this framework have needed to include some additional quenching tied to bulge growth after galaxy mergers to match the observed fraction of passive galaxies @xcite .",
    "one way to distinguish between these scenarios and gain insight into the transformation mechanisms at work is to test the link between quenching and morphological evolution by studying those galaxies whose morphological type places them on one side of the bimodality but whose star formation identifies them with the other .",
    "star - forming blue ellipticals are one example ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are understood to be a combination of recent arrivals to the red sequence @xcite , bulge - dominated systems experiencing triggered star formation after minor mergers @xcite or , at low masses , the formation of new disks in gas - rich environments @xcite .",
    "the other possibility , namely quenched or passive disk galaxies , is more challenging to explain because the shutdown of star formation must leave the disk in place . yet examples in the local universe do exist .",
    "lenticular or s0 galaxies are one example , although they typically live in galaxy clusters where interactions with the intercluster medium ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping , see * ? ? ? * ) can remove the gas supply and shut down star formation .",
    "however , s0 s have properties that do not depend on cluster density and a non - negligible fraction ( @xmath88% ) of nearby s0 s are isolated , suggesting that not all s0 s form as a result of living in dense environments @xcite . at slightly higher redshifts , @xmath9 ,",
    "axis ratio distributions and galaxy zoo ( gz ) morphologies have demonstrated an unmistakable population of red , disk - dominated galaxies that appear to live in the field and slightly overdense environments , but are not found solely in dense regions @xcite . finally , using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) data in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields at @xmath0 , @xcite compared color and morphologically classified mass functions to argue that quenching appeared to precede spheroid formation , finding hints of a red disk population at @xmath0 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "some examples of passive disks have even been found at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to utilize the unprecedented size of the cosmos field with its 1.64 deg@xmath10 of _ hst _ imaging to revisit the question of red , passive disks in field environments and quantify their origin and evolution since @xmath0 .",
    "we argue that the behavior of this population presents a challenge to models that attribute morphological and color evolution to a single event , and may shed light on mechanisms that affect the galaxy population more broadly .",
    "this work follows on mass function studies of the cosmos field as a function of color and morphological type by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite specifically showed a broad connection in the behavior of morphologically early - type galaxies and those with passive stellar populations , but also presented evidence for an increasing fraction at high redshift of non - spheroidal morphologies among quenched systems  this is the starting point for the present study .    throughout this paper , we use the ab magnitude system and adopt a standard cosmology with @xmath11=70 @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.3 and @xmath15=0.7 .",

    "stellar mass estimates for galaxies with photo-@xmath41s  also suffer from the uncertainty in luminosity distance introduced by the photo-@xmath41  error and the possibility of catastrophically wrong redshift information @xcite .",
    "more broadly , any stellar mass estimate suffers potential systematic errors from uncertainties inherent in stellar population modeling and various required assumptions , such as the form of the imf .",

    "* ) an element that is missing in the @xcite models .",
    "the recent and thorough investigation of population synthesis modeling by @xcite , however , argues that @xmath49 ratios estimated from @xcite are largely resistant to the uncertain contribution from tp - agbs as well as other limitations of current models .",
    "a further test is provided in @xcite who compare mass functions computed using bc03 and bc07 stellar population codes and conclude that @xmath820% differences in abundances can be introduced , especially for star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is also important to recognize that @xmath3 estimates may be affected by unrecognized systematic uncertainties at the 0.10.2 dex level .      because our goal in this paper is to study disk galaxies that have stopped forming stars , in this section we discuss the rest - frame galaxy colors we use to identify passive stellar populations .",

    "the broad wavelength coverage of cosmos ensures that the flux corresponding to a given rest - frame filter is well sampled .",
    "a similar diagram was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the upper - left portion of each redshift panel in figure [ fig : bicolor ] exhibits a relatively tight clump of galaxies that we associate with passive stellar populations .",
    "a sequence of star - forming galaxies is evident below and to the right of the clump in each panel . as a test ,",
    "we have colored in red those galaxies with seds best fit by early `` spectral '' type templates , as determined by the photo-@xmath41  code ( this category includes types 18 in the cosmos photo-@xmath41fits , see * ? ? ?",
    "highly star - forming templates are shown in blue . at most redshifts ,",
    "the early - type sed designation overlaps well with the associated passive clump .",
    "note that the location and orientation of the passive clump and star - forming sequence evolves somewhat given our choice of filters .",
    "in what follows , we will isolate passive clump galaxies ( also referred to hereafter as the `` red sequence '' ) using a joint color cut that evolves accordingly and is indicated by the two lines in figure [ fig : bicolor ] . recognizing that such color cuts are somewhat arbitrary , our goal is to evenly split the now meandering `` green valley '' that separates the two populations .",
    "we specify our thresholds in terms of the given filters because they correspond well to our observations and do a good job of making the passive clump distinct , although we acknowledge that a more general treatment would be valuable in future work .",
    "still , we emphasize that adjusting the details of the cuts defined below has little effect on the analysis that follows .",

    "at @xmath61 the combination of the color cuts above select 10%20% more passive galaxies than those with early - type sed templates , many of them scattered between star - forming and passive sequences . at higher redshifts , however , the sed method appears to miss genuine galaxies in the passive clump , as many as 20% at @xmath62 .",
    "we note that our conclusions regarding passive disk galaxies are unchanged if we use the sed fits to define the passive population .",
    "finally , we have checked for obscured star formation among the passive population as indicated by mips 24@xmath63 emission .",
    "we note that a significant fraction of 24@xmath63 emission , especially among the passive population , might arise from agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , among star - forming galaxies , the implied sfr from 24@xmath63 emission must be added to that from the uv flux which will dominate the output luminosity from star formation in our sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as a result ,",
    "our constraints on hidden star formation in passive galaxies compared to star - formers are upper limits . using the morphological classifications defined below ( grouping `` early '' and `` late '' disks together ) , our first test compares 3@xmath24 mips detection rates of passive versus star - forming disk galaxies . for @xmath64 , no passive disks are detected with mips while the detection rate among star - forming disks is roughly 10% . in our lowest redshift bin , @xmath65 ,",
    "1% of passive disks are detected compared to 10% of star - formers . at redshifts in between , the highest detection rates of passive disks occur at @xmath66 , where 5% are detected compared to 8% for star - forming disks .",
    "considering the full redshift range , these numbers confirm that the color - color methodology described above does not lead to significant contamination from hidden star formation .",
    "however , given the small numbers of mips detections , it is not possible to compare 24@xmath63 flux as a function of @xmath3 or put constraints on the relative amount of sfr hidden among passive population but below the mips detection limits .    for this , we perform a stacking analysis of the mips data in bins of stellar mass ( of width 0.5 dex ) and in the redshift intervals used throughout ( the minimum number of galaxies per bin is roughly 20 ) .",
    "using @xcite , we estimate mean ssfr given the stacked 24@xmath63 emission . across our @xmath830 stacked bins ,",
    "the average passive ssfr is roughly an order of magnitude less than the star - forming ssfr . in two bins this difference approaches a factor of 2 , and in several other bins , there is no stacked mips detection for passive galaxies .",
    "we note that the ir / sfr calibrations become uncertain at low 24@xmath63 luminosities below @xmath67 and several of our bins reach this limit . with this caveat and again ignoring contributions from agn",
    ", our stacking analysis provides a rough upper limit to the possible amount of hidden star formation ( sf ) in the average passive galaxy that corresponds to growth rates of 3%5% in @xmath3 per gyr .",
    "understanding the morphological makeup of the galaxy population is crucial to our goals in this paper . given the large samples ( typically more than @xmath68 galaxies ) made possible by the cosmos data , automated morphological classifiers figure prominently .",
    "it is well known , however , that techniques such as cas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or gini / m20 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) often disagree when compared to visual morphologies and can differ from each other . indeed , @xcite use two different classifiers  the gini / m20 method described in @xcite and a cas - like technique used in @xcite  to gauge the systematic uncertainty of broad categories such as `` spheroidal '' or `` disk - like . ''",
    "their analysis of the evolving distribution of morphologies in cosmos from @xmath0 serves as the basis for this work .",
    "we should also note that `` wiki - morphologies '' of the kind pioneered by gz @xcite are an alternative way to obtain visual morphologies for large samples .",
    "in this work , we are specifically interested in disk components living in passive galaxies . as such , the exact definitions of morphological type are less important than confidence in the ability of the chosen classifier to find disk - like structure even if embedded in bulge - dominated galaxies and , ideally , to parametrize the prominence of disks compared to an accompanying bulge component .",
    "the zest automated classifier satisfies these requirements and has also been trained to match visual classifications of local surveys .",
    "our strategy is to adopt the zest classification in the cosmos sample and test it both through visual inspection of cosmos galaxies and an independent check of our results using visual morphologies determined in goods - n and published in @xcite .",

    "of particular concern is the possibility that dust contamination in edge - on systems could hide residual star formation given that the integrated colors could be dominated by a quiescent bulge . to check this , we have recomputed the mass functions of passive galaxies with the requirement that all galaxies have a zest ellipticity class of 0 , corresponding to completely face - on systems .",
    "this reduces the sample size by @xmath880% .",
    "while the mass functions shift a bit under this assumption , the essential behavior captured in figure [ fig : mfnf_time_morph ] is unchanged , with the same relative abundance and mass dependence of the various morphological types preserved .",

    "another concern is the morphological @xmath4-correction which could mimic the rising abundance of passive disks at early times if , as expected , galaxies appear more disk - dominated at bluer rest - frame wavelengths . over the redshift range of the sample ( @xmath129 )",

    "passive disks account for about 10% of all galaxies .",
    "the fact that their abundance depends on both @xmath3 and redshift , and that these dependences are influenced by the strength of the disk component argues that passive disks hold clues to understanding both the quenching of star formation and morphological evolution within the galaxy population more broadly .",

    "we then discuss possible formation mechanisms , first ruling out simple fading of star - forming disks and strong environmental processes and then moving on to discuss disks regrown in mergers and the suggestion that quenching is initiated by internal structural changes .",
    "while no current model fully reproduces the observations at present , our constraints will help refine proposed quenching mechanisms and indicate that morphological and color transformations in galaxies proceed in multiple and sometimes separate stages .",
    "how significant are passive disks in the evolutionary history of galaxies ? ideally , we could answer this question by tracking the mass - dependent flow of galaxies transitioning through different evolutionary phases , but unfortunately , as discussed in section [ cosmic_variance ] , the strong cosmic variance uncertainties in the single cosmos field prevent a detailed treatment . broadly speaking",

    "* ) , passive disks always dominate at lower masses which is also where the newest arrivals to the red sequence can be found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that a large fraction of these quenching galaxies experience an initial passive disk phase .",

    "choosing a mass between 10@xmath121 and 10@xmath123 and comparing the highest and lowest redshifts sampled , we see that @xmath820%40% of new red sequence galaxies formed over this interval can be accounted for by the increase in the number of passive disks . at masses above @xmath810@xmath123 ,",

    "this reinforces the visual impression of figure [ fig : mfnf_time_morph ] , namely that passive disks evolve into spheroidals .",

    "[ fig : disk_c ] ]    at all times , there are as many if not more star - forming disks than passive disks , so it is easy to imagine that passive disks may be drawn from the star - forming population with one important caveat : there are almost no passive galaxies with `` extreme disk '' ( srsic  @xmath139 ) morphologies .",
    "such extreme disks are common in large numbers among star - forming galaxies at all masses and even dominate at the lowest masses where passive disks are most abundant .",
    "they would be easily detected if they existed in the passive population .",
    "therefore , the transformation to the red sequence either leads to the formation a bulge component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or requires the existence of one . in the latter case ,",
    "star - forming and passive disks with similar bulge components should differ only in color but not in their intrinsic structure .",
    "we will postpone a detailed comparison of bulge / disk decompositions , scale lengths , and @xmath49 evolution to future work and focus here on a simple comparison of the concentration ( @xmath140 ) of passive and star - forming early disks ( figure [ fig : disk_c ] ) .",
    "we consider the nearest redshift bin @xmath141 so that the acs @xmath18-band probes the reddest possible wavelengths ( least affected by star formation ) , and consider the mass range of @xmath142 .",

    "it also holds to @xmath145 despite rest - frame morphologies that sample bluer wavelengths .",
    "still , this signature could largely be driven by differences in @xmath49 gradients between star - forming and passive systems .",
    "given this tentative result and the stronger requirement that passive disks be more bulge - dominated than star - forming disks , it seems unlikely that passive disks form simply via the quenching and fading of star formation disk galaxies .      could passive disks be a product of dense environments ?",

    "in addition , @xcite show that less concentrated disks are more susceptible to starvation . yet , the very low - concentration `` extreme disk '' morphologies found in the star - forming population are almost completely absent among passive galaxies .",

    "instead agn may be responsible for subtle feedback cycles that prevent gas cooling on longer timescales ( 12 gyr ) after the cold gas is depleted ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this feedback is tied to the central black hole mass , this could explain why passive disks have large bulges ( section [ concentration ] ) , but it does not make clear why other star - forming disk galaxies with similar bulges have not been quenched ( figure [ fig : disk_c ] ) .",
    "finally , if quenching is initiated by low luminosity agn feedback , are mergers even required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the specific quenching process in these scenarios remains unknown , the agreement in figure [ fig : gas_disk_remnants ] nevertheless supports a formation mechanism in which the frequency and appearance of passive disks is strongly linked to their progenitor gas fractions .",
    "if star formation in passive disks is shut down because the gas supply is depleted , simulations show that such gas - poor disks can be more easily disrupted by mergers with lower mass ratios  that is , more minor interactions  than disks with high @xmath136 , owing to the ability of gas to regrow disks and suppress bulge formation @xcite .",
    "this suggests a two - step process where first , late - type star - forming disks are quenched and transformed into bulge - dominated , passive disks .",

    "the predicted remnants of morphological quenching are consistent with many of our observations .",
    "they would appear as passive disks with large bulges , would have a weak environmental dependence , and exhibit slow quenching , in this case initiated by gradual changes in internal structure .",
    "while more detailed comparisons between observations and simulations of morphological quenching @xcite are clearly needed , we note that many of the examples in figures [ fig : ex_rd_b1][fig : ex_rd_goods ] show large , thick disks . in future work , this may help distinguish between an early formation with thickening from disk instabilities that could accelerate mq @xcite and later disk regrowth @xcite .",
    "it is also important to determine if mq can explain why bulge growth leads to quenching in some galaxies but not in others as well as why passive disks are more disk - dominated at lower @xmath3 ( figure [ fig : mfn_abs ] ) .",
    "the higher gas fractions at these masses would naively require larger , not smaller bulges .",
    "finally , we note that morphological quenching requires testable deviations from the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and implies that gas disks in passive galaxies remain intact .",
    "subsequent mergers of passive disks in this scenario could therefore produce new star - forming galaxies instead of passive spheroidals .      finally ,",
    "while this work has focused on mass - limited samples at high redshift , a detailed study by @xcite of a subset of passive disks identified using gz in sdss provides additional insight .",
    "a direct comparison is not possible because the gz passive disks were selected using a single color ( @xmath167 ) and were required to be mainly face - on and to have spiral arms as identified by gz users .",
    "still , the two samples paint a consistent picture .",
    "red gz disks are more common at higher masses ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and tend to host larger bulges than their star - forming counterparts .",
    "their emission lines indicate little ongoing sf but are inconsistent with post - starburst spectra , favoring instead a gradual decline of sf over 12 gyr .",
    "they tend to live in intermediate environments consistent with the @xmath12010@xmath168 halos our observations suggest .",
    "more than 75% host nuclear bars and 50%80% show evidence for liner emission . assuming the gz sample is representative of passive disks in general , the @xcite analysis supports a formation mechanism that is strongly tied to a bulge and a central bar , somewhat weakly tied to environment , and capable of quenching star - formation slowly .",
    "we have used the cosmos survey to identify a significant population of non - star - forming , passive disk galaxies and have studied their importance with respect to the growth of the red sequence and the formation of spheroidal galaxies . after removing dusty contaminants , evidence for disk components",
    "is found in nearly half of galaxies on the red sequence at all redshifts , primarily at the low - mass end .",
    "the absolute number of passive disks below @xmath810@xmath123 appears to increase with time , mirroring the growth of the red sequence , although the number of passive spheroidals increases faster . above @xmath810@xmath123 ,",
    "the abundance of passive disks has declined since @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret these trends to indicate that passive disks may be a relatively common phase of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence , accounting for as much as 60% of newly quenched systems .",
    "the declining contribution of passive disks to the red sequence with time suggests that , once formed , they transform into spheroidals on moderately fast ( 13 gyr ) timescales .",
    "this is likely aided by the fact that unlike star - forming galaxies , passive disks may be more susceptible to morphological evolution induced by minor mergers , given their depleted gas supply @xcite .",
    "thus the formation of many red sequence ellipticals does not occur in a single event like a major merger , and may instead proceed through two or more evolutionary stages .",
    "understanding how passive disks form can shed light on the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution more broadly .",
    "do passive disks evolve slowly from star - forming disks that exhaust their gas supply after cooling is suppressed or become stabilized to fragmentation ? or , do they form more rapidly after some event , such as a merger or falling into a galaxy group ?",
    "while more work is needed , early results from this analysis and a study of a subset of passive disks in sdss @xcite provide tantalizing clues .",
    "first , passive disks are almost exclusively bulge - dominated .",
    "star - forming disks on the other hand include a large number of strongly disk - dominated galaxies at all epochs .",
    "a bulge component is either required to shut down star formation  perhaps because a bulge signals the presence of a potential agn  or",
    "is built during the formation process .",
    "the presence of a large bulge , however , does not guarantee that star formation is shut down . beyond this , passive disks with the same mass , redshift , and morphological type are more concentrated on average than star - formers .",
    "while these assertions should be verified with stellar mass bulge / disk decompositions , it appears that at least some fraction of passive disks is structurally distinct .",
    "we have used a toy model to show that mergers , which naturally increase bulge mass but can also form a new disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , produce remnants with a similar mass and redshift dependence as passive disks .",
    "this agreement suggests a strong link between morphology and @xmath169 .",
    "the problem with the merger / regrowth model remains understanding how the merger induces quenching .",
    "sdss observations of passive disk emission lines favor a slow process @xcite that operates over 12 gyr .",
    "this seems inconsistent with a merger - triggered quasar phase , which must be delayed to allow enough time for a new disk to form . on the other hand",
    ", slow quenching may take place in 10@xmath168 halos in which the group medium can slowly `` starve '' galaxies of fuel by stripping their hot gas reservoirs .",
    "environmental processes therefore present an alternative to the merger / regrowth model but have trouble accounting for the importance of bulges and the way in which passive disk morphologies depend on mass and redshift .",
    "the newly proposed morphological quenching scenario @xcite also predicts slow quenching as internal structural changes suppress disk fragmentation and star formation .",
    "this mechanism requires large bulges , as observed , and predicts thick stellar disks @xcite .",
    "more detailed comparisons and a test of the predicted mass and redshift dependences in this scenario are now needed .",
    "the prospects for resolving the formation mechanism look promising and we note that some combination of the processes considered here may be operating simultaneously .",
    "more detailed studies of the structure , color gradients , and stellar populations of passive disks will help link them with their progenitors . at the same time , it is important to verify the high disk fractions revealed by the zest classifier with bulge - to - disk decompositions , ideally performed in terms of stellar mass .",
    "this will confirm the significance of disk components and enable more direct comparisons to star - forming samples as well as simulations .",
    "improvements at low-@xmath41 will come from expanded , mass - limited samples , and at high-@xmath41 from clustering and pair - count studies .",
    "larger samples from future surveys will overcome cosmic variance and allow individual populations to be tracked as they evolve through different stages .",
    "both with current surveys and in the future , passive disks offer a unique opportunity to separate and understand the processes that drive global patterns of galaxy evolution since @xmath0 .",

    "<S> the increasing abundance of passive `` red - sequence '' galaxies since @xmath02 is mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies . in this paper , however , we show that in detail the correspondence between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect , providing insight into the physical origin of this evolution . using the cosmos survey , we study a significant population of red - sequence galaxies with disk - like morphologies . </S>",

    "<S> they represent nearly one - half of all red - sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses ( @xmath1 ) where they are increasingly disk - dominated . as a function of time , the abundance of passive disks with @xmath2 increases , but not as fast as red - sequence spheroidals in the same mass range . at higher mass , </S>",
    "<S> the passive disk population has declined since @xmath0 , likely because they transform into spheroidals . </S>",
    "<S> based on these trends , we estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of passive disks therefore has broad implications for our understanding of how star formation shuts down . because passive disks tend to be more bulge - dominated than their star - forming counterparts , a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain their origin . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the strengths and weaknesses of several more sophisticated explanations , including environmental effects , internal stabilization , and disk regrowth during gas - rich mergers . </S>",
    "<S> while previous work has sought to explain color and morphological transformations with a single process , these observations open the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may actually proceed through several separate stages . </S>"
