    "we reproduce here , for completeness , the derivation in @xcite of the on - shell overlap for the homogeneous spin chain , but all the next steps are mathematically the same as in the case of @xmath118 considered in @xcite .",

    "any on - shell bethe state , @xmath123 , must be an eigenstate of @xmath122 .",
    "since the eigenvalue of @xmath122 is conserved , the overlap of the mps with @xmath123 , can be non - zero only if the @xmath122-eigenvalue of @xmath123 is equal to that of the mps , that is , also zero .",
    "for @xmath123 to have an @xmath122-eigenvalue zero , it must be parity - even , that is , the set of bethe roots , @xmath124 , of @xmath123 must be invariant , as a set , under the parity transformation @xmath125 . since the partial nel states are components of the mps , the same reasoning applies to the overlap of a partial nel state and @xmath123.*. the reason is that the latter is not an eigenstate of @xmath126 , and the @xmath126 selection rule does not apply to its overlap with mps and consequently with any of the nel states . ]    aside from the above reasoning , the technical reason for the vanishing of the overlap , in either ( [ off - shell ] ) or ( [ homogenb ] ) , is not immediately obvious .",
    "however , it can be proven in the latter representation by noting that the matrix @xmath21 in ( [ bmatrix ] ) has a zero eigenvalue if the variables @xmath30 are bethe roots .",

    "setting the rapidity variables @xmath124 on - shell , the matrix @xmath21 becomes ,    @xmath127    the fact that this matrix is degenerate follows from the identity    @xmath128    where the contour of integration encircles the poles of the integrand at @xmath129 counterclockwise , and the last equality is obtained by evaluating the residue at infinity . as a consequence of ( [ identity.01 ] ) ,",
    "the vector with components    @xmath130    can be seen to be a zero eigenvector of @xmath21 ,    @xmath131    this implies that a partial nel state has a zero overlap with a generic highest - weight on - shell bethe state , where _ generic _ here means a state which is _ not _ invariant under parity transformation , @xmath132 .",

    "more concretely , the rapidity variables form pairs of equal magnitudes but opposite signs ,    @xmath134    which leads to a pole in the prefactor of ( [ homogenb ] ) .",
    "this pole cancels the zero in the determinant which lead to the vanishing of the overlap in subsection * [ overlap.vanishes]*. to compute the overlap , we resolve the @xmath135 ambiguity , due to the zero and the pole , by shifting the rapidity variables slightly away from their parity - invariant values , by defining    @xmath136    calculate the overlap for small but finite @xmath137 , then take the limit @xmath138 .",
