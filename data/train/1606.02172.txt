    "in the past thirty years piezoelectric materials has been widely used as sensors or actuators for the active vibration control of various smart structures like beams @xcite , plates @xcite , and shells @xcite . in typical situations one or two",
    "piezoelectric patches are attached to one or both sides of the elastic structure to be controlled @xcite .",
    "if these patches are excited by an oscillating voltage , they contract or elongate and thereby exert , depending on the configuration of patches and electrodes , membrane force or bending moment on the structure . in the area of bonded patches",
    "the structure changes from homogeneous through the thickness to a sandwich structure with two or three layers : one elastic layer and one or two piezoelectric patches perfectly bonded to it .",
    "modern piezoelectric devices , such as harvesters @xcite , require more complicated piezo patch arrangements .",
    "thus , shape and topology optimization of piezo patches integrated into elastic structures becomes a challenging open field of research , in particular for thin smart structures ( see , eg . , @xcite and the references therein ) .    due to the above",
    "mentioned complicated laminate structure , the problems of equilibrium and vibration of smart sandwich plates and shells admit exact analytical solutions of the three - dimensional theory of piezoelectricity only in a few exceptional cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by this reason",
    "different approaches have been developed depending on the type of the structures .",
    "if smart sandwich plates and shells are thick , no accurate two - dimensional theory can be constructed , so only the numerical methods applied to three - dimensional theory of piezoelectricity make sense @xcite . however , if smart plates and shells are thin , the reduction from the three- to two - dimensional theory is possible and different approximations can be constructed . up to now",
    "two main approaches have been developed : ( i ) the variational approach based on hamilton s variational principle and on some ad - hoc assumptions generalizing kirchhoff - love s hypothesis to smart sandwich plates and shells @xcite , ( ii ) the asymptotic approach based on the analysis of the three - dimensional equations of piezoelectricity , mainly for the plates @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the variational approach is the necessity of having an ansatz for the displacements and electric field that is difficult to be justified , while simplicity and brevity are its advantages .",
    "the asymptotic method needs no a priori assumptions ; however , the direct asymptotic analysis of the 3-d differential equations of piezoelectricity is very cumbersome .",
    "the synthesis of these two approaches , called the variational - asymptotic method , first proposed by @xcite and developed further in @xcite , seems to avoid the disadvantages of both approaches described above and proved to be quite effective in constructing approximate equations for thin - walled structures .",
    "note that this method has been applied , among others , to derive the 2-d theory of homogeneous piezoelectric shells in @xcite and the 2-d theory of purely elastic sandwich plates and shells in @xcite .",
    "note also the closely related method of gamma convergence used in homogenization @xcite and plate theories @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct the rigorous first order approximate two - dimensional smart sandwich shell theory by the variational - asymptotic method .",
    "we consider the sandwich shell with one elastic layer in the middle and two piezoceramic patches symmetrically bonded to it .",
    "the dimension reduction is based on the asymptotic analysis of the action functional containing small parameters that enables one to find the distribution of the displacements and electric field from the solution of the so - called thickness problem . using the generalized prager - synge identity for the inhomogeneous piezoelectric body ,",
    "we provide also the error estimation of the constructed theory in the energetic norm .",
    "we apply this theory to the problem of forced vibration of a circular plate partially covered by two circular rings of piezoceramic layers with thickness polarization excited by a harmonic voltage and find the exact analytical solution to this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this short introduction the variational formulation of the problem is given in section 2 .",
    "sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the asymptotic analysis of the action functional . in section 5 the two - dimensional theory of piezoelectric sandwich shells is obtained . in section 6",
    "we provide the error estimation of the constructed theory .",
    "section 7 presents the exact analytical solution to the forced vibration of a circular sandwich plate .",
    "finally , section 8 concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a two - dimensional smooth surface bounded by a smooth closed curve @xmath1 .",
    "at each point of the surface @xmath0 ( called the middle surface of the shell ) a segment of length @xmath2 in the direction perpendicular to the surface is drawn so that its centre lies on the surface .",
    "if the length @xmath2 is sufficiently small , the segments do not intersect each other and fill the domain @xmath3 occupied by a sandwich shell in its undeformed state .",
    "we analyze the forced vibration of the sandwich shell consisting of three layers shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the middle layer is made of an elastic ( dielectric ) transversely isotropic and homogeneous material that does not exhibit piezo - effects .",
    "the upper and lower layers are made of the same transversely isotropic homogeneous piezoceramic material with the thickness polarization perfectly attached to the middle one .",
    "these layers can be used as sensor or actuator for the purpose of active control of shell vibration .",
    "the faces of piezoelectric layers are covered by the electrodes whose thickness is neglected .",
    "thus , the undeformed shell occupies the domain specified by the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the equation of the middle surface @xmath0 , and @xmath6 are the cartesian components of the normal vector @xmath7 to this surface .",
    "we shall use latin indices running from 1 to 3 to refer to the spatial co - ordinates and the greek indices running from 1 to 2 to refer to the surface co - ordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the curvilinear co - ordinates @xmath10 take values in a domain of @xmath11 , while @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "let the upper and lower faces of the piezoceramic layers covered by the electrodes ( at @xmath13 ) be denoted by @xmath14 . on these surfaces the electric potential",
    "is prescribed @xmath15    hamilton s variational principle of piezoelectricity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) states that the true displacement @xmath16 and electric potential @xmath17 of an inhomogeneous piezoelectric body change in space and time in such a way that the action functional @xmath18=\\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\\int_{\\mathcal{v}}[t(\\mathbf{x},\\dot{\\mathbf{w}})-w(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon } , \\mathbf{e})]\\ , dv \\ , dt\\ ] ] becomes stationary among all continuously differentiable functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfying the initial and end conditions @xmath21 as well as constraint .",

    "the material constants with an over - bar correspond to those of the elastic ( dielectric ) material .    the problem is to replace the three - dimensional action functional by an approximate two - dimensional action functional for a thin shell , whose functions depend only on the longitudinal co - ordinates @xmath60 and time @xmath61 .",
    "the possibility of reduction of the three- to the two - dimensional problem is related to the smallness of the ratios between the thickness @xmath2 and the characteristic radius of curvature @xmath62 of the shell middle surface and between @xmath2 and the characteristic scale of change of the electroelastic state in the longitudinal directions @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "we represent the latter as the sum of two quadratic forms @xmath91 and @xmath92 corresponding to longitudinal and transverse electric enthalpy densities , respectively .",
