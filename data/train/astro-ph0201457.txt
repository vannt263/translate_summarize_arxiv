    "ls  5039 is a relatively faint ( @xmath2 ) and massive star of type o6.5  v((f ) ) @xcite that is one of only a few confirmed massive x - ray binaries ( mxrbs ) with associated radio emission @xcite .",
    "it has radio - emitting relativistic jets characteristic of galactic microquasars , and it is probably a high energy gamma ray source as well @xcite .",
    "we recently discovered that the system is a short period binary ( @xmath3 d ) with the highest known eccentricity ( @xmath4 ) among o star binaries with comparable periods @xcite .",
    "this high eccentricity probably results from the huge mass loss that occurred with the supernova ( sn ) explosion that gave birth to the compact star in the system @xcite .",
    "binaries that suffer large mass loss in a sn are expected to become runaway stars , and recently both we @xcite and @xcite found that ls  5039 has a relatively large proper motion that indicates that the binary has a record - breaking peculiar space velocity among mxrbs .",
    "reliable estimates for the masses of the components of the binary are of key importance for any discussion about the evolution of this remarkable system . here",
    "we present an investigation of the possible mass range for the x - ray star based on a stellar wind accretion model for the x - ray production (  2 ) .",
    "this analysis relies on our observations of the wind emission effects in the h@xmath0 profile and the wind models of @xcite .",
    "we then apply our derived mass estimates for both stars to determine the probable masses and orbital parameters prior to the sn based on the system s current eccentricity (  3 ) .",
    "we find that the predicted and observed runaway velocities are in good agreement , and , thus , ls  5039 provides the best verification to date of model predictions about the outcome of a sn explosion in a massive binary .",
    "the x - ray production in mxrbs results from mass accretion through a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) stream or by bondi - hoyle accretion from the stellar wind of the luminous primary @xcite .",
    "the systems experiencing rlof usually have large x - ray luminosities and striking optical emission lines",
    ". however , ls  5039 has a modest x - ray flux @xcite and no obvious emission lines @xcite , and we show below that the o - star is probably smaller than its critical roche surface .",
    "thus , we can safely assume that most of the mass accretion in ls  5039 occurs through capture of the primary s stellar wind flow .",
    "the wind accretion luminosity of mxrbs depends on the system separation , wind velocity law , mass loss rate , and mass of the accretor @xcite .",
    "if we can estimate these binary and wind parameters from spectroscopy , then the mass of the compact star can be found by comparing the predicted and observed x - ray luminosities , @xmath5 . here",
    "we present such an analysis based on the mass loss rate derived from our observations of the h@xmath0 profile @xcite .",
    "all the parameters needed in this analysis ultimately depend on the assumed mass of the o - star primary that is poorly constrained at the moment .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the primary has a mass typical of single stars of its spectral classification , approximately @xmath6 ( see the mass calibration of @xcite and the study of comparable stars in the young binary , dh  cep , by @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , there is evidence that the primaries in mxrbs may be undermassive for their luminosity @xcite , and in extreme cases , their mass may be a factor of three lower than the mass derived by comparing their position in the hertzsprung - russell diagram with evolutionary tracks .",
    "thus , we show here the results of a wind accretion model for ls  5039 based on a range in assumed primary mass of 10  @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite show how the h@xmath0 profile in o - stars grows from a pure absorption feature to a strong emission line with increasing stellar wind mass loss rate , and they present a scheme to estimate the mass loss rate based on the observed equivalent width , @xmath7 , of h@xmath0 .",
    "we observed the h@xmath0 line in the spectrum of ls  5039 over three runs in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 with the coude feed telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( see @xcite for details ) , and we show in figure  1 the average profile from each run after shifting each spectrum to the rest frame and convolving the 1998 and 2000 spectra to the resolution of the 1999 run ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile appears to be filled in by broad , residual emission that appears as shallow emission peaks in the wings ( perhaps also present in the vicinity of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the emission was apparently stronger during the 1998 and 1999 runs , and we compare in figure  1 these profiles with the deeper absorption observed in 2000 ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "the net equivalent width over the entire emission and absorption blend was 2.22 , 2.15 , and 3.10   ( @xmath11 ) for the average profiles from 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 , respectively .",
    "we use the mean of these values , 2.49  , in the analysis below .",
    "we see no evidence in our spectra of variations in the residual emission with orbital phase , and so we can reliably assume that this weak emission forms in the wind of the primary ( and not , for example , in a gas stream or accretion disk in which we would observe orbital variations in radial velocity ) .",
    "we need estimates of the underlying photospheric component of absorption equivalent width , effective temperature , @xmath12 , radius , @xmath13 , and wind velocity law in order to derive a mass loss rate from the observed equivalent widths using the wind models of @xcite ( see their table  7 ) .",
    "we adopted the spectral classification calibration of @xcite to estimate @xmath14  kk and @xmath15 for the o6.5  v((f ) ) primary , which is in reasonable agreement with the results from strmgren photometry by @xcite and with the values of these parameters derived by @xcite for similar stars .",
    "the radius , @xmath13 , follows from @xmath16 and the assumed mass , @xmath17 .",
    "we assumed the wind velocity law usually applied to o - stars : @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the final parameter to be set is the appropriate photospheric absorption equivalent width .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite only give one value of @xmath23    that is specified for a model photosphere with @xmath24  kk and @xmath25 .",
    "while this effective temperature is nearly applicable here , we expect the equivalent width will be larger in our @xmath26 case since the stark broadening of the balmer lines increases with gravity .",
    "we used the nlte models of @xcite to estimate that the h@xmath0 equivalent width should be @xmath27 stronger at @xmath26 compared to @xmath25 ( for @xmath24  kk ) , and we pro - rated accordingly the photospheric equivalent width given by @xcite .",
    "our derived estimates of @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and mass loss rate @xmath29 are given for several assumed values of @xmath17 in table  1 .",
    "the mass loss rate values are close to the average found for o6.5  v stars by @xcite , @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath31  y@xmath32 ) .",
    "we next calculated the predicted x - ray luminosity for a range in assumed secondary mass , @xmath33 , using the wind accretion model of @xcite ( using the wind velocity law noted above ) .",
    "their expression for the x - ray accretion luminosity is @xmath34 where the efficiency factor for the conversion of accreted matter to x - ray flux is @xmath35 .",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath36 for a separation @xmath37 and an accretion radius @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the flow velocity of the wind relative to the accreting star ( see their eq .",
    "given the two assumed masses and the known period , we determined the time - averaged separation of the binary and then calculated @xmath5 using our estimates of the wind speed and mass loss rate from above .",
    "a sample result is shown in figure  2 for the average and extreme values of the derived mass loss rate ( from the 1999 and 2000 h@xmath0 equivalent widths ) for a test primary mass of @xmath40 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath5 depends on the assumed distance .",
    "we used the magnitude @xmath41 and reddening @xmath42 from @xcite , and then estimated the star s angular diameter by comparing the unreddened magnitude with model magnitudes from @xcite for the adopted @xmath12 and @xmath16 ( calibrated with the fundamental @xmath12 data of @xcite ) .",
    "the distance is then found from the working value of the stellar radius , @xmath43  kpc .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity was adjusted from the measurements of @xcite who assumed a distance of 3.1  kpc .",
    "this prorated estimate of @xmath5 is shown as the shaded region in figure  2 .",
    "the estimated mass of the secondary is found where the predicted wind accretion luminosity matches the observed @xmath5 .",
    "we repeated the wind accretion calculation for a grid of assumed o - star masses , and our final results are listed in table  1 and plotted in a mass diagram in figure  3 .",
    "the results are relatively insensitive to our assumptions about @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "we found , for example , that models made using @xmath25 led to lower mass loss rates but also lower wind velocities , so that the wind accretion rates changed very little . because the slope @xmath44 is relatively large ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the details of the accretion model ( for example , the value of the efficiency parameter , @xmath45 ) do not greatly affect the implied secondary masses .",
    "in fact , the largest uncertainty in the results comes from the variation in h@xmath0 equivalent width between observing runs , which presumably reflects significant changes in the stellar wind mass loss rate .",
    "table  1 also lists the size of the roche radius at periastron , and we find that the o - star fits comfortably within its roche lobe over the full range in assumed mass .",
    "our results indicate that the secondary has a mass between 1 and @xmath1 ( based on the extremes of the observed h@xmath0 equivalent width and adopted primary mass range ) , and , thus , the secondary is probably a neutron star .",
    "the catastrophe of a sn explosion in a massive binary has two immediate consequences .",
    "first , the system acquires a large eccentricity that is directly related to the amount of mass lost in the sn event .",
    "the periastron separation in the altered orbit corresponds to the pre - supernova semi - major axis .",
    "second , by conservation of momentum , we expect the entire system to attain a runaway velocity that again depends on the mass lost in the sn .",
    "we demonstrate here that the values of the observed eccentricity and the probable masses derived above indicate that a huge amount of mass was lost in the sn event that formed ls  5039 .",
    "we can use the observed eccentricity to relate the pre- and post - sn orbital parameters if we make the following reasonable assumptions : ( 1 ) the pre - sn orbit was circular ( almost certainly the case for such a short period and evolved system ) , ( 2 ) any kick velocity imparted to the remnant core due to asymmetries in the explosion was relatively small @xcite , ( 3 ) the primary suffered only minor ablation of mass in the explosion so that its pre- and post - sn mass is the same @xcite , and ( 4 ) the system has experienced little or no tidal reduction of the orbital eccentricity since the sn event . @xcite and",
    "@xcite give the expressions required to calculate the pre - sn parameters , and we list in table  2 the resulting orbital and physical parameters for an eccentricity @xmath46 @xcite and the masses derived in  2 . table  2 gives the pre - sn period , @xmath47 , semi - major axis , @xmath48 , sn precursor mass , @xmath49 , and the mass lost in the sn , @xmath50 .",
    "the first striking result is the large mass loss that occurred in the sn in ls  5039 .",
    "some 5 - @xmath51 was lost in the explosion , amounting to more than 81% of the precursor s mass .",
    "this is much larger than the typical inferred mass loss fraction of 35% found by @xcite for black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the sn precursor had a smaller mass than the primary at the time of the explosion , so the system was not in danger of total disruption @xcite .",
    "the pre - sn orbit was very compact and the stars were in close proximity .",
    "we list in table  2 the sizes of the roche radii in the pre - sn stage .",
    "these radii are quite restrictive , and we find that the primary overfills the roche lobe in the higher mass solutions .",
    "however , the current radius @xmath13 given in table  2 may be larger than the radius at the time of the sn if the primary has evolved to a larger size since then .",
    "nevertheless , the secondary s roche radius is also quite small , and it is possible that the system was in a contact or over - contact configuration at the time of the sn . some kind of close interaction must have occurred since by the time of the sn the mass ratio had reversed and the separation had been increasing @xcite . given this evidence of a pre - sn interaction , the observed c deficiency of the primary @xcite probably results from nuclear - processed gas transferred from the sn progenitor .",
    "the currently faster than synchronous rotation of the primary @xcite may correspond to the synchronous rate in the shorter period , pre - sn configuration .    finally , we list in table  2 the predicted system runaway velocity , @xmath52 , based on conservation of momentum ( with errors propagated from the uncertainty in the observed eccentricity ) .",
    "the predictions suggest that the system should have a runaway velocity in excess of 100 km  s@xmath32 .",
    "although the systemic velocity along the line of sight is unexceptional @xcite , the tangential velocity does appear to be large .",
    "the system has a proper motion of @xmath53 mas  y@xmath32 and @xmath54 mas  y@xmath32 in the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite , and @xcite have recently used optical and radio astrometry to find an improved estimate of @xmath55 mas  y@xmath32 and @xmath56 mas  y@xmath32 .",
    "we used the latter measurement together with the systemic radial velocity from @xcite ( adjusted to the velocity offset of the @xmath57 line that presumably forms deep in the photosphere and is less affected by expansion in the atmosphere ) to find the peculiar component of space motion , @xmath58 ( following the methods described in @xcite ) , and this quantity is listed in the final row of table  2 .",
    "we find that there is satisfying agreement between the predicted and observed space velocities , especially towards the higher mass range .",
    "note that if the eccentricity had decreased since the the explosion , then the predicted velocities would be lower than the observed velocities , which is contrary to the results in table  2 .",
    "this strengthens our assumption that little or no circularization has occurred in ls  5039 since the sn .",
    "the example of ls  5039 provides a strong confirmation of the predictions made about the eccentricity and runaway velocity that result from a sn explosion in a binary , and we find that both the observed eccentricity and peculiar space velocity can be consistently explained by our derived set of pre- and post - sn parameters . on the other hand",
    ", the system may be exceptional among mxrbs in the huge amount of mass lost in the sn .",
    "indeed , ls  5039 appears to be the fastest runaway object known among the mxrbs @xcite .",
    "the example of ls  5039 hints that there are other similar systems with low x - ray luminosity and small radial velocity variations , but this class of `` x - ray quiet '' sn descendants will be difficult to detect @xcite .",
    "we thank the kpno staff , and in particular diane harmer and daryl willmarth , for their assistance in making these observations with the kpno coude feed telescope .",
    "institutional support has been provided from the gsu college of arts and sciences and from the research program enhancement fund of the board of regents of the university system of georgia , administered through the gsu office of the vice president for research .",
