    "as a central problem of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , heat conduction has been of vital interest since the beginning of the 19th century . during his extensive investigations on heat transport in solids",
    "fourier discovered around 1807 @xcite a proportionality between the temperature gradient @xmath0 and the heat respectively energy current density in the material , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is some material constant  the heat conductivity .",
    "concentrating on one - dimensional chains of interacting subsystems the temperature gradient can be discretized as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the temperature difference between two adjacent subsystems and @xmath5 their distance . introducing the current @xmath6 through some area @xmath7 , fourier s law ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "instead of approaching a global equilibrium state with some temperature @xmath10 , a solid , under some external perturbation by a temperature gradient ( introduced by heat baths with different temperatures ) , enters a local equilibrium state only : the temperature may vary from one macroscopically small but microscopically large part of the system to the other . the heat transport itself",
    "is called _ normal _ if the conductivity @xmath11 remains finite , whereas a diverging @xmath11 indicates a _ ballistic _ transport .",
    "having established a normal diffusive behavior , all further efforts on the topic of heat conduction in the last decades have been directed towards a microscopic foundation of the above phenomenological law .",
    "one of the first concepts addressing the occurrence of regular heat conduction from a microscopic basis is the peierls - boltzmann theory @xcite .",
    "essentially , peierls proposed a modified boltzmann equation replacing classical particles by quantized quasi particles , the phonons .",
    "he was able to show that in order to obtain normal heat conduction an anharmonicity in the interaction potential was necessary , associated with the well known umklapp processes of phonon scattering in solids .",
    "since quantized normal modes are treated here as classical particles , i.e. , as being always well localized in configuration as well as momentum space , this approach contains some conceptual shortcomings , though .",
    "another microscopic approach to heat conduction is the famous green - kubo formula , derived on the basis of linear response theory @xcite .",
    "thereby , the current is taken as the response of the material to an external perturbative potential , originally , the electromagnetic potential . by a direct mapping of these ideas on thermal transport phenomena ( perturbations due to thermal gradients @xcite )",
    "serious questions remain open , since in this case it is not possible to define a proper potential in the hamiltonian of the system resulting in a temperature gradient .    to account for the problem of defining a proper potential for a thermal perturbation",
    ", there have been efforts to model the system coupled to several heat baths in terms of an open quantum system @xcite .",
    "these methods reveal a normal transport behavior even in very small quantum systems , but are numerically challenging , especially for larger systems , since the investigations are done in the liouville space instead of the hilbert space .",
    "all of the above microscopic approaches to heat conduction assume that the system under consideration is perturbed by some external environment ( e.g.  a scenario , where a solid is heated at one side cooled at the other ) .",
    "as already predicted by einstein in his considerations on brownian motion @xcite , the diffusion constant appearing in a local equilibrium steady state scenario of heat conduction should equal the decay constant for the relaxation from a non - equilibrium state to the global equilibrium in the same system . in the latter case",
    "there is no further external perturbation involved . in the same spirit we will introduce yet another approach to heat transport within quantum systems .",
    "recently , the relaxation behavior of small quantum systems has been considered within the theory of quantum thermodynamics @xcite , calling for a direct solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "based on the hilbert space average method ( ham ) @xcite , the complicated schrdinger dynamics of a multi level system may be reduced to a set of simple rate equations . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss the application of ham on heat conducting model systems .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss the connection of heat diffusive behavior with energy diffusion and present a comparison of the results of ham with the full numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to show how heat respectively energy diffusive behavior may emerge from first principles  here the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the class of systems we are going to analyze first is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and described by the hamiltonian @xmath12     coupled subunits with ground level and band of @xmath13 equally distributed levels ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "black dots indicate the initial state used.,width=264 ]    here @xmath15 identical subunits according to the same local hamiltonian @xmath16 are assumed to have a non - degenerate ground state and a band of @xmath13 exited states each , equally distributed over some band width @xmath17 such that the band width is small compared to the local energy gap @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , @xmath19 , @xmath17 in units of @xmath18 ) .",
    "these subunits are coupled by an energy exchanging next neighbor interaction @xmath20 , chosen to be a ( normalized ) random hermitian matrix allowing for any possible transition such as to avoid any bias .",
    "our results will turn out to be independent of the exact form of this matrix .",
    "we choose the next neighbor coupling to be weak compared to the local gap ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 in units of @xmath18 ) .",
    "this way the full energy is approximately given by the sum of the local energies and those are approximately given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the probability to find the @xmath25-th subsystem in its excited state .",
    "one of the big advantages of the present model is the clear partition of the hamiltonian in a local and an interaction part , respectively .",
    "this partition allows for a unique definition of both a local energy or even a local temperature as well as a proper current .",
    "however , note that the presented method itself does not need such a special kind of model system but is in principle also applicable to more general situations .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the single excitation subspace , i.e. , all states with one subsystem excited ( irrespective of which state within the band ) , all others in the ground state .",
    "let us introduce a set of projection operators @xmath26 in this subspace , projecting out the set of states corresponding to the @xmath25-th subsystem occupying its excitation band , rather than its ground state ( these operators feature the unit operator of dimension @xmath13 for the excited band of the @xmath25-th system else zeros ) .",
    "thus , the total system state is given by @xmath27 where none of the @xmath28 is normalized individually .",
    "furthermore , one may introduce also some standard transition operators @xmath29 ( unit operator at position @xmath30 ) . according to the properties of transition operators we find @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 both , the local and the interaction part of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:3 ] ) in our reduced hamiltonian model",
    "can now be written in terms of these new operators as @xmath33 with a local diagonal hamiltonian matrix @xmath34 and a hermitian interaction matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamics of the model system defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq:3 ] ) respectively ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) is governed by the schrdinger equation . here",
    "we will mainly be interested in a coarse - grained description suppressing the information about the state index within the respective bands , concentrating , e.g. , on the total probability of occupying a band or not , only .",
    "after transforming the hamiltonian to the interaction picture we perform a second order dyson expansion of the time evolution for the short time step @xmath36 @xmath37 with the two time evolution operators @xmath38    a pertinent quantity in the context of heat conduction will be the change of local energy in one subunit @xmath25 in the time interval @xmath36 given by the probability @xmath39 using the short time evolution operator ( [ eq:8 ] ) , one gets @xmath40 for simplicity we suppress in the following the explicit notation of the time dependence of the operators , states and probabilities . according to the definition of @xmath41 we find in second order @xmath42 (",
    "note that @xmath43 is hermitian due to the hermiticity of the interaction ) .    due to the additive representation of the interaction ( [ eq:7 ] ) and the definition of the first oder time evolution operator ( [ eq:9 ] ) one may find the analogous off - diagonal block form for the first oder time - evolution operator @xmath44 the time dependent coefficients @xmath45 contain the integration of the interaction matrix @xmath46 over @xmath47 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , the second oder time evolution operator ( [ eq:10 ] ) has a more complicated structure in terms of the transition operators .",
    "introducing the interaction ( [ eq:7 ] ) into ( [ eq:10 ] ) ( using the property ( [ eq:5 ] ) ) one finds @xmath48 this operator decomposes into a diagonal and an off - diagonal part @xmath49 with @xmath50 and a suitable definition of the coefficients @xmath51 . by using ( [ eq:5 ] )",
    "one may convince oneself of the operator identities @xmath52 by means of the expansion of the time - evolution operators in terms of projectors and transition operators and those operator identities one is able to reformulate ( [ eq:13 ] ) by exchanging time evolution operators and projectors as @xmath53 since @xmath54 is a probability we get , furthermore , the normalization condition @xmath55 .",
    "this condition is already fulfilled in the zeroth order of all probabilities @xmath56 . due to this fact the sum over all other orders has to vanish .",
    "all first order terms together cancel out each other directly .",
    "remaining second oder terms lead to the additional conditions @xmath57",
    "according to ( [ eq:11 ] ) the expectation value of the operator ( [ eq:20 ] ) defines the time dependence of the probability @xmath24 .",
    "we approximate this expectation value by an average over some appropriate hilbert space compartment  say the mean of the expectation value over all reachable states  called the hilbert space average @xmath58 .    the hilbert space average method ( ham )",
    "is , in essence , a technique to guess the value of some quantity defined as a function of the full system state @xmath59 if @xmath59 itself is not known in full detail .",
    "here it is used to produce a guess for the expectation values @xmath60 if the only information about @xmath59 is the given set of initial expectation values @xmath61 .",
    "such a statement naturally has to be a guess , since there are , in general , many different @xmath59 that are in accord with the given set of @xmath62 but possibly produce different values for @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the key question for the reliability of this guess is whether the distribution of the @xmath60 produced by the respective set of @xmath59 s is broad or whether almost all those @xmath60 are approximately equal .",
    "it can be shown that if the spectral width of @xmath63 is not too large and @xmath63 is high - dimensional almost any @xmath59 yields an expectation value close to the mean of the distribution of the @xmath60 and thus the ham guess will be reliable @xcite . to find that mean one has to average with respect to the @xmath59 s .",
    "this is called a hilbert space average and denoted as @xmath64 such averages are well known and derived in all detail in @xcite .",
    "for any hermitian operator @xmath65 one finds @xmath66 with the partial traces in the respective subspace @xmath25 with dimension @xmath67 ( note @xmath68 ) .    plugging in the operator @xmath63 from ( [ eq:20 ] ) into the probability ( [ eq:12 ] ) , approximating the expectation values by the hilbert space average and furthermore using the operator identities ( [ eq:21 ] ) , one finds for the probability @xmath69 furthermore , using ( [ eq:23 ] ) with the dimension @xmath70 in each subspace",
    ", we end up with the probability @xmath71    a first order approximation of these traces is straightforward and done like in the derivation of fermi s golden rule ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) getting here @xmath72 defining the decay constant @xmath73 and remembering that @xmath74 one eventually finds @xmath75    the above approximation for the trace of the square of the time - evolution operator ( [ eq:26 ] ) is only valid within a small time interval like for fermi s golden rule implying the two conditions ( see @xcite ) @xmath76 as long as these conditions are fulfilled the given second order time evolution approximation is valid and one may iterate ( [ eq:28 ] ) in the limit of @xmath36 being extremely small to find the _ rate equation _ for the system . since the system is a finite chain of @xmath15 subsystems we get a slightly different equation for the first and the last system in the chain .",
    "the complete system of differential equations , thus , reads @xmath77 @xmath78 under the conditions ( [ eq:29 ] ) the system should follow this rate equation thus establishing a statistical behavior from pure schrdingerian dynamics !    from ( [ eq:31 ] ) one finds that the change of the probability in the @xmath25th subsystem only depends on its left and right neighbor . therefore ,",
    "if the above criteria ( [ eq:29 ] ) are fulfilled , so that the system indeed follows the respective rate equation , we may concentrate on the minimal model of two subunits only , without loss of generality . because of the special next neighbor relationship of the above dynamical equation the results of the minimal model can be generalized to the behavior of a chain of a large number of such subsystems .",
    "that such a behavior as described in the last sections is , indeed , feasible can be demonstrated by a comparison of the solution of the above rate equation with the exact solution of the full system schrdinger equation .",
    "for this reason we consider a model consisting of three subunits with @xmath79 levels each in the exited band of width @xmath80 coupled by a random energy exchanging next neighbor coupling @xmath81 .",
    "for these parameters the two criteria ( [ eq:29 ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "initially we start with an excitation in the first system , all other systems being in their ground state , observing the redistribution of energy . the comparison for @xmath82 in fig .",

    "the results are condensed into the histogram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . obviously , almost all initial states lead to approximately the same small deviation .",
    "thus a good agreement of ham with the exact result may safely be expected regardless of ham being a best guess only .",
    "( in fact this is the essence of thermodynamical statements : they hold typically , but not always . )",
    "furthermore , to analyze how big this `` typical deviation '' is , we have computed @xmath86 for a @xmath82 system with the first subunit initially in an arbitrary excited state , for different numbers of states @xmath13 in the bands .",

    "inset : dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath15 for @xmath79.,width=302 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3a ] , the deviation scales like @xmath88 with the band size , i.e. , vanishes in the limit of high dimensional subunits .",
    "this behavior does not come as a complete surprise since it has theoretically been conjectured and numerically verified in the context of equilibrium fluctuations of non - markovian systems @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3a ] shows that @xmath89 goes down also with increasing number of subunits @xmath15 but then levels off .",
    "altogether the new method ham appears to be applicable even down to moderately sized subsystems , i.e. , not too few levels @xmath13 in the upper band .",
    "thus , as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , a system with only a single excited level would lead to large deviations from the rate equation behavior .    using instead of pure initial states mixed states ( which are typical in the context of thermodynamical phenomena )",
    "a drastic further reduction of @xmath90 can be expected .",
    "this is due to the fact that pure state fluctuations may cancel partially if added together .",
    "we concentrate in the following on a model ( cf .  fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) for which the criteria ( [ eq:29 ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "in essence , the used subunits should be weakly coupled to fulfill the given criteria , i.e. , the interaction between the subunits has to be small compared to the local energy .",
    "the dynamical behavior is then approximately governed by the rate equation ( [ eq:30])-([eq:32 ] ) . as argued in the last paragraph of sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , it is enough to consider a minimal model of @xmath84 subunits , without loss of generality .",
    "this minimal system behaves according to the rate equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) with the decay constant ( [ eq:27 ] ) . the respective equation for the second system is simply obtained by an exchange of the indices in ( [ eq:30 ] ) .",
    "in order to compute the energy diffusion constant in the given model system , we have to consider the energy current inside the system .",
    "the energy current is defined by the change of the internal energy @xmath91 in the two subunits @xmath92 the total internal energy in such a subunit is given by the probability to be in the excited band of the subunit times the width of the energy gap , @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we may reformulate the current due to the change of the probability being in the excited band as @xmath94 the change of the probabilities in time are given by the rate equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) so that @xmath95 for a larger system with @xmath96 the consideration is quite similar and the result in principle the same .",
    "of course , the current definition is a little bit more complicated , since the energy relaxation in a central system leads to a current to both sides .",
    "but by properly splitting up the result into a current to the left respectively right system leads to the same dependence of the current between subunit @xmath25 and @xmath97 on the respective probability difference .",
    "according to ( [ eq:36 ] ) the current is a linear function of the probability difference ( gradient ) respectively _ energy difference ( gradient ) _ inside the system .",
    "this refers to a statistical behavior since energy diffuses through the system only due to the energy distribution in the system .",
    "therefore we may extract the energy diffusion constant from the above equation , identifying the parameter @xmath98 with the transport coefficient given in ( [ eq:27 ] ) .",
    "this energy diffusion constant only depends on the coupling strength of the subunits @xmath22 and on the state density of the excited band @xmath99 .",
    "( note that in the model at hand the energy gradient is discretized as an energy difference , because of the discrete structure of the model , as already stated in sect .",
    "[ sec:1 ] [ cf .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ] . )",
    "up to now we have restricted ourselves to the energy transport within the system on the route from a non - equilibrium initial state to a global equilibrium final state . of course",
    "this could be translated into heat transport insofar as heat is nothing but thermal energy .",
    "however , the states far away from equilibrium preclude a straight - forward interpretation : in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we have prepared the system initially in a state with the first system completely in its exited band , all others being in their ground states and , indeed , the system behaves statistically . by a simple translation to temperatures by fitting to a boltzmann distribution",
    "this initial state would show a really strange temperature profile : one finds the first system at negative temperature ( completely excited , i.e. , inversion and therefore negative , infinite temperature ) , all others at zero temperature .",
    "nobody would expect a normal heat conduction behavior in such a far from equilibrium situation .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case we have confirmed a statistical relaxation of energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .    to investigate a situation more appropriate for heat transport we should use an initial state already near the final global equilibrium state , with only a small temperature gradient .",
    "we first start with a pure state observing the decay of such a state by solving the schrdinger equation only . finally , one may sum up over many pure state trajectories finding the time evolution for an initially mixed state .",
    "but with a temperature diffusive behavior already for pure states we are sure to find it also for an initially mixed state , even with reduced fluctuations .",
    "let us restrict ourselves in the following to only two subunits  the proper minimal model as argued before .",
    "however , let us immediately generalize the model to a more complicated structure with more than one excitation band per subunit .",
    "the results of ham from the above considerations is valid also for this more general situation .",
    "the model system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .     equally distributed levels ( @xmath84 subunits).,width=302 ]    the band index @xmath100 is reserved for the left system whereas @xmath101 belongs to the right system .",
    "we take a product state @xmath102 as the respective initial state for all further investigations . for the single subsystem states we choose a `` quasi '' thermal state with temperature @xmath103 , i.e. , a superposition of states according to the boltzmann distribution . here , we use the term `` quasi '' to label this special group of pure states , even if it is _ not _ a mixed state as usual for thermal states .",
    "nevertheless , the occupation probability of the energy eigen states refers to the boltzmann distribution !",
    "thus , a mixture of many of such `` quasi '' thermal pure states may lead to the usual thermal state .",
    "furthermore , we treat the bands as `` quasi '' degenerate since the band width is much smaller than the gap @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the levels inside each band are equally occupied according to the temperature @xmath103 . the probability distribution of the first subsystem depending on the band energy @xmath104 and the appropriate number of states @xmath105 in the band is therefore given by @xmath106 with the partition function @xmath107 .",
    "the second subsystem distribution is obtained simply by exchanging @xmath100 by @xmath101 and the respective quantities of the second subsystem .",
    "the important quantity for all further considerations is the probability distribution of the whole system .",
    "since the total state is a product state the probability distribution of the complete system state @xmath108 is simply the product of the single probabilities @xmath109 however , it is convenient here to use a new set of coordinates for the combined spectrum in terms of the mean energy @xmath110 of a band and some energy displacement @xmath111 @xmath112    , @xmath113 axes respectively ; transformation to the new parameters @xmath114 ; black bands indicate the complete spectrum .",
    "examples : @xmath115 are states , where the first system is in its first band , the second one in its ground state , @xmath116 are states , where both systems are in the first excited band etc.,width=302 ]    ( all energies , also @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are measured in units of @xmath18 . ) to support intuition we show both sets of coordinates in fig .  [ fig:5 ] : the full spectrum ( black bands ) can either be characterized in terms of the single subsystem spectra @xmath117 or by @xmath114 .",
    "the latter coordinates appear as a @xmath118-rotation of the original ones .",
    "introducing a small temperature difference @xmath4 around the mean temperature @xmath10 so that @xmath119 and transforming to the new parameters ( [ eq:39 ] ) one finds the probability distribution @xmath120 with the number of states @xmath121 in the band @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , in order to get a near equilibrium situation the temperature gradient @xmath4 has to be very small in comparison to the mean temperature @xmath122 .",
    "therefore we expand the exponential function in ( [ eq:40 ] ) in terms of @xmath4 finding in first order @xmath123 where also the product of partition functions has been approximated in first order of the temperature gradient @xmath4 by @xmath124 .",
    "again , the important quantity is the energy current between the two subsystems . the total energy in the first subunit is now given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the time dependent probability distribution in the first system .",
    "to get the respective first system probability distribution @xmath126 from the time dependent full system probability distribution @xmath108 we have to trace over the second subsystem by summing over @xmath101 , finding @xmath127 . according to this total energy in subsystem 1",
    "the current along the chain reads @xmath128 or , switching to the new parameters ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:39 ] ) ) @xmath129 for a single band model the sum over @xmath110 would break down and we recover the result ( [ eq:35 ] ) .",
    "the change of the probability @xmath130 is again described by the rate equation according to the ham .",
    "since the complete model decomposes into several energy subspaces , the derivation is essentially just as given in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the respective energy transport coefficient results as a more complicated form depending on the band it belongs to ( @xmath131 ) . however , we require that @xmath98 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath111 and @xmath132 , since the energy transport from system 1 to system 2 should be as good as in the reverse direction",
    ". therefore we end up with the ham rate equation @xmath133 the fact that @xmath98 depends on the respective band is already obvious from ( [ eq:27 ] ) , which depends on the state density of the band . plugging in the rate equation ( [ eq:44 ] ) into the current ( [ eq:43 ] )",
    "we find @xmath134 again , the current is simply a function of the actual state .    for a short time",
    "step we may use the first order approximation of the `` thermal '' initial state ( [ eq:41 ] ) . since we are summing over @xmath111 and @xmath132 the zeroth order terms according to ( [ eq:41 ] )",

    "the remaining first order part @xmath135 gives a heat current proportional to the temperature difference @xmath4 . by comparing this current with fourier s law ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    ", one can extract the heat conductivity coefficient as @xmath136 a quantity depending only on parameters of the respective model system and on temperature .",
    "this is a very general formula for the heat conductivity derived from ham , valid for the class of model systems depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] with an arbitrary number of bands .",
    "let us return in the following to the single band model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , with the partition function of a single @xmath137-level subsystem @xmath138 . in this case ham leads to the unique energy diffusion constant @xmath139 ( see ( [ eq:27 ] ) ) . furthermore",
    ", in this single band model only the energy band @xmath140 contributes to the conductivity @xmath11 , since for all other bands all possible @xmath111 parameters are zero ( cf .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "there are two possible values for the band @xmath141 , namely @xmath142 and the number of levels in these two sub - bands are equal @xmath143 , due to the construction of the model .",
    "one thus gets for the conductivity ( [ eq:47 ] ) @xmath144    the dependency of the transport coefficient @xmath11 on temperature is displayed in fig .",

    "there is , however , no @xmath147 behavior for small temperatures , but note that this is only to be expected for three dimensional crystal lattices with a linear phonon dispersion relation for small momenta . the exponential behavior for small temperatures @xmath148 results from the gap in the system and is difficult to treat for small temperatures since it is an essential singularity ( typical for systems with an energy gap ) .",
    "furthermore we find a @xmath149 behavior rather than the usual @xmath150 behavior in the high temperature limit .",
    "again , the usual @xmath150 is no rigorous general result , peierls only states that the exponent should be between minus one and minus two .    by introducing the heat capacity",
    ", the above result for the heat conduction coefficient can further be simplified . starting with the canonical partition function of a single subunit @xmath151 and the definition of the heat capacity in terms of the partition function @xmath152 one finds for the heat capacity of one subunit @xmath153 from a comparison with ( [ eq:48 ] )",
    "one derives @xmath154 i.e. , the heat conductivity is given by the energy diffusion constant @xmath98 multiplied by the heat capacity @xmath155 of a single subunit .",

    "furthermore , two conditions have been established which could help to classify whether a given model should show a statistical diffusive behavior or not .    the approximation involved ( mainly the replacement of exact expectation values by a hilbert space average ) has been tested by a numerical comparison of the derived rate equation and the exact schrdinger equation .",
    "surprisingly , we have found for the present model system that energy diffusion occurs right from the start and already far from equilibrium .    for an initial quasi thermal state featuring a small but finite temperature gradient",
    "we have been able to find a normal heat conducting behavior in terms of a finite _ heat conductivity _",
    "@xmath11 . even for a more complicated model system ( several bands per subunit ) it was possible to derive a theoretical expression for the transport coefficient in terms of the parameters of the hamiltonian",
    "finally , a reformulation of the transport coefficient has led to a connection with the energy transport coefficient and the heat capacity .",
    "what impact do those results for our `` design model '' have on real physical systems ?",
    "for an application of ham one has to organize the system as a `` grain - structure '' of weakly coupled subunits .",
    "then , for the emergence of normal transport , the local bands and their couplings that mediate the transport should obey the criterion ( [ eq:29 ] ) individually .",
    "if this can be established ham predicts that energy will diffuse from subunit to subunit .",
    "it has long since been appreciated that coarse - graining ( i.e. , tracing out irrelevant degrees of freedom ) may change the effective dynamical laws even qualitatively . an obvious example is encountered when some accelerated electron in a solid transfers energy and momentum to vibrational degrees of freedom thus giving rise to particle transport . for the origin of heat transport in insulators",
    "a correspondingly simple picture seems to be missing though .",
    "here we have introduced a specific model class for which such a concept of information reduction can easily be incorporated .",
    "we thus have been able to clearly specify the conditions under which the resulting effective dynamics can be characterized as normal energy diffusion .",
    "irreversibility and thermal resistance are thus traced back to a `` reduced description '' : `` in reality '' the full dynamics is still controlled by the schrdinger equation , as has explicitly been checked here for still small enough total quantum systems .    the desired structure may be achieved by coarse - graining periodic systems like spin chains , crystals , etc .  into entities containing many elementary cells and taking the mesoscopic entities as the subunits proper and the effective interactions between the entities as the couplings .",
    "increasing the `` grain size '' will result in higher state densities within the subunits and relatively weaker couplings such that above a certain minimum grain size the criteria ( [ eq:29 ] ) will eventually be fulfilled . in this way",
    "a qualitatively new type of dynamical behavior can be seen to evolve as the observational level becomes more and more coarse - grained .",
    "of course , the resulting subunits can not generally be expected to feature the same gapped spectral structure as our design model .",
    "but ham should be applicable also to more realistic systems , and work in that direction is under way .",
