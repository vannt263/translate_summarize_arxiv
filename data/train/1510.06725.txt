    "nanoscale thermal transport is of considerable importance in the operation of modern electronic , optoelectronic , and thermoelectric devices.@xcite in superlattices ( sls ) , multiple interfaces between different materials play a critical role in thermal transport.@xcite advanced experimental techniques have enabled the measurements of the in - plane@xcite and cross - plane@xcite thermal conductivity is sls .",
    "experiments show that the thermal conductivity of sls is anisotropic and considerably lower than that of the constituent bulk materials.@xcite theoretical studies find that diffuse interface scattering is responsible for lowering of the in - plane ( and , in part , the cross - plane ) thermal conductivity , while the thermal boundary resistance ( tbr ) between adjacent layers is a key factor in the cross - plane thermal - conductivity reduction.@xcite    superlattices based on iii - v compound semiconductors have widespread use in optoelectronics .",
    "@xcite in quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) , self - heating is the main issue limiting the development of room - temperature ( rt ) continuous - wave lasing , which is exacerbated by the poor thermal conduction through hundreds of interfaces in a typical structure .",
    "@xcite a good understanding of the influence of interfaces on the thermal conductivity tensor of iii - v sls would enable advances in the design and modeling and optoelectronic devices for enhanced reliability .    the interfacial transport behavior is largely dependent on the material system and interface quality.@xcite the acoustic mismatch model ( amm ) and the diffuse mismatch model ( dmm )",
    "have been traditionally used to calculate the phonon transmission coefficient and the resulting tbr of an interface.@xcite these two models yeild the lower and upper limits of the tbr , respectively , but do not satisfactorily explain realistic experimental results.@xcite molecular dynamics simulations @xcite have provided valuable insights into heat transport across a number of solid - solid interfaces .",
    "the non - equilibrium green s function technique ( negf ) has also been applied to describe the phonon dynamics,@xcite generally without phonon - phonon scattering . in general ,",
    "atomistic simulations are limited by computation burden , which makes it hard to study complicated sl structures , such as the active region of solid - state lasers.@xcite    in this paper , we present a semiclassical model describing the full thermal conductivity tensor of iii - v compound sl structures , and apply it to iii - arsenide systems .",
    "the phonon transport inside each layer is captured by solving the phonon boltzmann transport equation ( pbte ) in the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) , with rates describing the common internal scattering mechanisms as well as the partially diffuse scattering from the interfaces.@xcite the in - plane thermal conductivity is obtained from the layers connected in parallel , while the cross - plane conductivity is calculated from the layers and tbrs in series .",
    "the tbr of each interfaces is calculated by interpolating between the amm and dmm transmission coefficients at the interface .",
    "both the partially diffuse interface scattering and the amm - dmm interpolation are described with the aid of the same momentum - dependent specularity parameter , in which there is a single adjustable parameter",
    " an effective interface rms roughness .",
    "the model can effectively describe complicated systems with an arbitrary number of interfaces and random layer thicknesses . despite the model simplicity ,",
    "the calculation results agree well with experimental data from multiple studies by different groups.@xcite the model is also quite general : it is applicable to sls in other material systems with good - quality interfaces and semiclassical phonon transport.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sl ] describes the sl thermal transport model in detail : the role of interface roughness on the baseline layer conductivity that affects both cross - plane and in - plane conduction , as well as the additional effect it has on cross - plane transport through the tbr . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we illustrate the robustness of the transport model by comparing our calculation results with a number of experiments on gaas / alas and ingaas / inalas superlattice systems , and we also calculate the thermal conductivity tensor in a quantum cascade laser active region .",
    "we conclude with sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this paper is accompanied by electronic supplementary materials .",
    "a semiconductor superlattice ( sl ) is a periodic structure , with each period consisting of two or more thin layers of different materials .",
    "iii - v semiconductor sls have been widely used in electronic and photonic devices.@xcite experimental results on several material systems show that thermal conductivity of a sl is substantially lower than that of a weighted average of the constituent bulk materials.@xcite thermal transport in sls also exhibits pronounced anisotropy : the cross - plane thermal conductivity ( the thermal conductivity in the sl growth direction , normal to each planar layer ) is much lower than the in - plane thermal conductivity.@xcite theoretical studies show that the interfaces between adjacent layers are responsible for both the overall reduction and the anisotropy of thermal conductivity .",
    "@xcite here , we offer a model that quantitatively captures both effects of the interfaces .    even though a typical layer thickness in iii - v sl structures is on the order of a few nanometers",
    ", we argue that coherent phonon transport can be neglected and that the semiclassical phonon boltzmann equation provides an appropriate framework for analyzing heat flow in these systems over a range of temperatures .",
    "the reasons for this assertion are the following :    1 .",
    "we are interested in the thermal conductivity of sls near room temperature , where the phonon - phonon interaction is strong and breaks the phonon wave coherence.@xcite the phonon coherence length in bulk gaas at room temperature has been estimated to be smaller than 2 nm@xcite and this value will be even lower in ternary compounds owing to alloy scattering .",
    "several sl structures we consider here @xcite have layers of thickness greater than or comparable to the phase - breaking length in individual layers , which implies that transport in them is largely incoherent .",
    "indeed , experiments find that coherent transport features are important in gaas / alas sls below t@xmath0100 k.@xcite in sls with ternary iii - v compounds , coherent transport phenomena would be important at even lower temperatures .",
    "2 .   even in best - quality lattice - matched sls",
    ", there exists atomic scale interface roughness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slsche])@xcite which may break phonon phase coherence.@xcite based on molecular dynamics , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the thermal conductivity of sls with rough interfaces increases monotonically with period length , in contrast to perfect sls that feature nonmonotonic dependence .",
    "this finding confirms that phonons suffer from phase - breaking scattering in rough - interface sls .",
    "3 .   in qcls ,",
    "the sl has multiple periods , often called stages , with many layers in each stage .",
    "the layer thickness in each stage is highly variable , depending on the desired optoelectronic properties.@xcite consequently , the qcl sl structure behaves as a nearly random multilayer system , which breaks phonon phase coherence.@xcite    as a result of all the reasoning above , we do not consider phonon coherent transport or phonon confinement to analyze thermal transport .",
    "we use bulk dispersions and the phonon boltzmann transport equation in the sl thermal conductivity calculations .      as mentioned briefly above",
    ", there will inevitably exist a few transition layers between adjacent materials in a sl structure.@xcite figure  [ fig : slsche ] shows a schematic of interfaces between lattice - matched crystalline layers in sls . in the transition region , if we drew a line that separated the atoms of one crystal from those of the other , we would get a jagged boundary .",
    "therefore , we model the interface with an effective interface rms roughness @xmath1 , which captures the basic properties of interfacial mixing .",
    "the thicker the transition layer , the higher the @xmath1 .",
    "most iii - v sls are grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe)@xcite or metal - organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd),@xcite both well - controlled growth environments . as a result",
    ", all the interfaces in the sl should be nearly identical .",
    "therefore , we use a single roughness @xmath1 to model all the interfaces .",
    "the probability of a phonon reflecting specularly from a rough interface is represented by a wave - number - dependent specularity parameter@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the magnitude of the wave vector , and @xmath4 represents the angle between @xmath5 and the normal direction to the interface .",
    "this expression is nominally derived in the limit of uncorrelated roughness;@xcite but considering that more correlated surfaces scatter phonons more specularly,@xcite surface correlation can effectively be captured by using a lowered @xmath1.@xcite    diffuse interface scattering affects all phonons in the sl and influences phonon mode occupation inside each layer .",
    "@xcite the effect on interface roughness on mode population can be captured by solving the pbte with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the result is an effective interface scattering rate @xcite that captures the interplay between internal mechanisms ( normal and umklapp three - phonon , isotope , alloy , dopant , and electron scattering ; see supplementary materials ) and interface roughness in a layer of thickness @xmath6 :    @xmath7    where @xmath8\\{1-\\exp[-l/\\tau_\\mathrm{b , internal}(\\vec{q})v_\\mathrm{b,\\perp}]\\}}{1-p_\\mathrm{spec}(\\vec{q})\\exp[-l/\\tau_\\mathrm{b , internal}(\\vec{q})v_\\mathrm{b,\\perp}]}\\ ] ]    is a mode - dependent scaling factor .",
    "here , b denotes the phonon branch and @xmath5 its wave vector , @xmath9 is the component of the phonon group velocity normal to the interface , and @xmath10 is the total relaxation time due to internal scattering mechanisms in the layer ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the effective rate of interface scattering ( [ eq : interface rate ] ) depends on both roughness and the relative size of the layer thickness ( @xmath6 ) to the mean free path for internal scattering ( @xmath11 ) : for very thin layers ( @xmath12 ) the phonon `` sees '' both interfaces of a layer ( @xmath13 , a well - known expression derived by ziman@xcite ) , while for very thick layers ( @xmath14 ) , the phonon will scatter many times due to internal mechanisms between successive interactions with interfaces , as if the interfaces were completely independent ( @xmath15 $ ] ) . for details , see ref . [ ] . through this additional effective scattering rate ,",
    "rough interfaces that bound each layer affect phonon population and thus influence both in - plane and cross - plane thermal transport.@xcite this is the first aspect of interfacial influence on thermal transport in sls .",
    "the cross - plane thermal conductivity bears an additional influence of the interfaces.@xcite in order to carry heat along the cross - plane direction , phonons must cross interfaces . as there are two different materials on the two sides of the interface ,",
    "the phonon transmission probability through the interface is not unity , and a thermal boundary resistance emerges .",
    "there have been two widely accepted models  the acoustic mismatch model ( amm)@xcite and the diffuse mismatch model ( dmm )  for the calculation of the phonon transmission coefficient and the tbr.@xcite    from the amm point of view , the interface between two isotropic media is treated as a perfect plane and the phonons are treated as plane waves .",
    "the amm transmission coefficient is the ratio of transmitted to injected heat flux , and is calculated upon solving the elastic continuum equation with appropriate boundary conditions ( continuity of the normal component of the wave number , which will yield a snell s law analogue , and continuity of the velocity field and tangential force ) .",
    "the amm transmission coefficient for a phonon going from material 1 to material 2 can be expressed as : @xmath16 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the perpendicular acoustic impedances of sides 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath18 is the mass density of a material . here , we work with full phonon dispersions , so it is hard to achieve detailed balance , i.e. , conserve both momentum and energy for a phonon going through an interface . however , the lattice structures and dispersion curves for iii - as are very similar , so we simply momentum and the resulting error in energy conservation is quite small .",
    "on the other hand , in the dmm , the assumption is that the coherence is completely destroyed at the interface : a phonon loses all memory about its velocity and randomly scatters into another phonon with the same energy .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be derived from the principle of detailed balance as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the phonon densities of states in materials 1 and 2 , respectively .    in reality , for a high - quality interface like that in a iii - v sl structure , phonon interface scattering is neither purely specular nor completely diffuse ; consequently , the amm overestimates while the dmm underestimates the transmission coefficient .",
    "@xcite in order to accurately model the tbr in a large temperature range and for various interfaces , we will _ interpolate _ between the two models for the transmission coefficient.@xcite _ we posit that the specularity parameter ( [ equ : spec ] ) can also be used to give weight to the probability of phonon transmission without momentum randomization , i.e. , to the amm transmission coefficient . _ in other words , we introduce an effective phonon transmission coefficient as @xmath22\\cdot t_{\\mathrm{b}}^\\mathrm{dmm}(\\vec{q}).\\ ] ] this coefficient captures both the acoustic mismatch and the momentum randomization at a rough interface between two media .",
    "the rougher the interface , the lower the specularity parameter , and therefore the higher the tbr .",
    "the tbr will only be picked up by the phonons trying to cross an interface , thus having an influence on cross - plane transport only .",
    "this is the second effect the roughness has on the thermal transport .",
    "we note that the above discussion holds for acoustic phonons , which are the dominant carriers of heat in semiconductors .",
    "the role of optical phonons in bulk heat transport has recently been highlighted,@xcite but they are relatively minor contributors to bulk heat transport owing to the low occupation number and group velocity .",
    "it is also unclear how optical phonons behave when crossing boundaries , but it is likely that their transmission is highly suppressed because their existence hinges of good crystallinity . a recent paper by ong and zhang supports this assertion .",
    "@xcite therefore , optical phonons are neglected in this study .      first , each layer s thermal conductivity is calculated in the same way as the bulk thermal conductivity of a material ( see sec . s - i in supplementary materials ) , but with an additional scattering rate ( [ eq : interface rate ] ) due to the presence of interfaces.@xcite the layer thermal conductivity obtained this way will already be lower than the bulk thermal conductivity of the same material .",
    "second , the tbr is calculated using a transmission coefficient interpolated from the amm and the dmm values .",
    "the tbr from material 1 to material 2 , denoted @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24 the denominator in the expression is a correction factor introduced following the modified definition of temperature of simons@xcite and zeng and chen,@xcite as the phonon distribution at the interface is far from equilibrium .",
    "the correction ensures that the tbr vanishes at a fictitious interface inside a material . here",
    "@xmath25 represents the average value of transmission coefficients over the brillouin zone .    with properly calculated layer thermal conductivity and the tbr",
    ", the in - plane and cross - plane thermal conductivity of a sl with two layers per period can be written as@xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the layer thicknesses of materials 1 and 2 , respectively , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the corresponding layer thermal conductivities .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath31 represent the tbrs from layer 1 to layer 2 and from layer 2 to layer 1 .",
    "the expressions can be extended to the situation of a sl with @xmath32 layers of thicknesses @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35    with the understanding that @xmath36 , owing to periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. , after the last layer @xmath32 comes layer @xmath37 again ) .",
    "considering that the tbrs are generally not symmetric ( @xmath38 ) , the cross - plane thermal conductivity is not the same in both directions , so sls can exhibit thermal rectification properties .",
    "we have compared the results from our simple model with several experimental results by different groups on both in - plane@xcite and cross - plane@xcite thermal conductivity of iii - arsenide sls and obtained good agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : yao ] shows the rt in - plane thermal conductivity of gaas / alas sls with various layer thicknesses . to compare with yao s",
    "data,@xcite we set the effective interface roughness to 6 @xmath39 .",
    "the in - plane thermal conductivity should first increase monotonically with increasing layer thickness , then saturate at the average bulk value of roughly 66 w / mk .",
    "the measurement is non - monotonic and appears to saturate at a lower value , which yao @xcite suggested stems from pronounced interfacial mixing and thus considerable alloy scattering of phonons between layers .",
    "we note that our model does not capture significant interfacial mixing and is instead suitable for high quality interfaces with only atomic - scale roughness .",
    "figure  [ fig : yu ] shows the in - plane thermal conductivity of a gaas / alas sl with a layer thickness of 70 nm at various temperatures .",
    "the symbols are the experimental results reported by yu _ _ et al.__@xcite and the line is our calculation with @xmath40 .",
    "the calculation agrees well with experiment over a wide temperature range .",
    "figure  [ fig : capinski ] shows the cross - plane thermal conductivity of gaas / alas sls with various layer thicknesses and from 100 k to 400 k. symbols show the experimental results reported by capinski and maris@xcite and capinski _ _ et al.__@xcite the corresponding curves are obtained from our model .",
    "we first set the layer thicknesses to those reported in experiments and then vary the effective roughness to get the best fit ; panels ( b1)(b4 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : capinski ] illustrate how sensitive thermal conductivity is to rms - roughness variation .",
    "the optimal - fit rms roughness is 1.75 @xmath39 , 1.65 @xmath39 , 1.3 @xmath39 , and 1.8 @xmath39 for the 40@xmath4140 , 25@xmath4125 , 10@xmath4110 , and 12@xmath4114 sls , respectively [ @xmath41 is the notation in these two experimental papers ] .",
    "the small values of the rms roughness are in keeping with high - quality interfaces , featuring large - area atomically flat terraces .",
    "the cross - plane thermal conductivity varies very little as the temperature changes , indicating that the tbr indeed dominates thermal transport across layers .",
    "luckyanova _ _ et al.__@xcite recently measured both the in - plane and the cross - plane thermal conductivity of a gaas / alas sl . our calculation for the same structure and the experimental results are shown in table  [ tab : luck ] .",
    "all the calculation results used an effective interface rms roughness of 1.1  for the 2-nm system and 1.9  for the 8-nm one , which results in good agreement for the cross - plane conductivity ; however , the measured in - plane thermal conductivity is considerably lower than the calculation .",
    "in fact , the experimental data from luckyanova _ _ et al.__@xcite shows a great discrepancy with all the previous experiments on similar systems.@xcite for example , the in - plane thermal conductivity of their 8-nm sl is considerably smaller than that of the 5-nm sl in yao s paper,@xcite which is counterintuitive and does not agree with well - established trends of increasing thermal conductivity with increasing layer thickness . furthermore , the cross - plane thermal conductivity ( 8.7@xmath42 w / mk ) is considerably smaller than that of capinski _ et al . _ ( 10.52 w / mk ) with similar layer thickness .",
    "the earlier experiments@xcite should have worse or at best equivalent interface quality to the samples in the most recent work,@xcite owing to the development in growth techniques that happened over the past few decades ; yet , older samples show higher conductivities . luckyanova _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite also performed density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) simulation , the results of which are about twice what they measured .",
