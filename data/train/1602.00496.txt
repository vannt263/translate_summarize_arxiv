    "lorentz symmetry  @xcite , the covariance of the laws of physics under rotations and boosts in four - dimensional spacetime , plays a central role in physics and is at the basis of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and general relativity . in particle physics , it is closely related to the invariance under the combined transformations of charge conjugation , parity , and time reversal ( cpt ) . in quantum field theories , with mild assumptions , lorentz symmetry implies cpt invariance , while cpt violation implies lorentz violation ( lv )  @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "research into the breaking of lorentz symmetry is strongly motivated by theories that attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity  @xcite .",
    "some of these theories contain mechanisms that naturally lead to lorentz violation @xcite .",
    "the intriguing possibility exists that remnants of lv at high energy are detectable at energies that are in reach of present - day experiments .",
    "the detection of the corresponding signals would be a revolutionary discovery and could point us to the correct theory of quantum gravity .",
    "lv , in fact , is one of the few possibilities to get an experimental handle on quantum gravity .    in particle physics , the consequences of lv at low energy",
    "are conveniently studied within an effective field theory ( eft ) , which allows for a systematic and model - independent framework .",
    "the pertinent operators are built from sm fields coupled to fixed - valued lorentz tensors ( sometimes called `` background fields '' ) , while keeping many desirable sm features , such as gauge invariance and the sm gauge - group structure , energy and momentum conservation , micro - causality , and observer lorentz covariance @xcite .",
    "the tensors parametrize lv , which presumably originates from more fundamental lorentz - tensor fields that obtained a vacuum expectation value through spontaneous symmetry breaking at high energy .",
    "this approach has led to the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite , which is the most general and widely - used framework for theoretical and experimental considerations of lorentz and cpt violation in particle physics .    at low energy , lv results in unique experimental signals that are in principle",
    "easily distinguished from lorentz - invariant physics beyond the sm , in particular frame dependence of observables and a dependence on sidereal time .",
    "experimental constraints can be characterized and classified in terms of bounds on the components of the lv tensors in the sme .",
    "an overview of the existing experimental bounds can be found in ref .",
    "most experimental bounds on lv have been obtained in the area of quantum electrodynamics , while recently progress also has been made in the weak sector  @xcite .",
    "however , most precision tests of lorentz and cpt symmetry take place at low energies where quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is nonperturbative .",
    "this complicates the study of lv operators that contain quark or gluon fields , to the extent that only a relatively small number of direct bounds exists for the strong sector @xcite .    in this paper , therefore , we explore the use of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) , the low - energy eft of qcd  @xcite ( for reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , to investigate the consequences of several higher - dimensional lv operators with quark and gluon fields . we construct , in section  [ sec : lvlagr ] , chiral lagrangians that describe lv interactions between pions , nucleons , and photons .",
    "the large nucleon mass is treated in the heavy - baryon approach @xcite .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to previous studies of the breaking of parity  @xcite and time reversal  @xcite from dimension - six operators , as applied , for example , to p - odd  @xcite and p- and t - odd  @xcite electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon . within this framework ,",
    "it becomes possible to study various lv observables for hadronic and nuclear degrees of freedom . in section [ sec : lvham ] we first construct the lv hamiltonian , and next we identify in section [ sec : expts ] observables for clock - comparison experiments with nuclei in atoms and ions and storage - ring experiments with nucleons .",
    "we obtain bounds on our lv tensors from existing experiments and identify opportunities to further constrain the parameter space .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook in section  [ sec : summary ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : so4 ] we briefly review the construction of the chiral lagrangian and the use of naive dimensional analysis .",
    "appendix  [ app : eom ] is devoted to the use of field redefinitions to reduce the number of effective operators .",
    "we start with a set of operators relevant below the electroweak scale @xmath1 gev , but above the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking @xmath2 1 gev in qcd , where @xmath3 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "lv is associated with a high - energy scale @xmath4 beyond @xmath5 , presumably to be identified with the planck scale .",
    "many lv operators have been discussed elsewhere in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite all possible lv operators compatible with the sm gauge structure and of mass - dimension 3 and 4 are given .",
    "this restriction to power - counting renormalizable operators is sometimes called the minimal standard - model extension ( msme ) .",
    "a characterization of nonminimal , higher- ( 5- , 6-,@xmath6 ) dimensional operators exists for electrodynamics , neutrinos , and free fermions @xcite .    in an eft framework ,",
    "higher - dimensional operators are expected to be suppressed by powers of some high - energy scale , @xmath7 . in this respect , dimension-3 and",
    "-4 operators are less natural in an eft for lv , where one assumes that @xmath8 .",
    "additional symmetry arguments are then needed to prevent the lv physics at high energy from resulting in large dimension-3 and -4 lv operators at a low - energy scale such as @xmath9 . to evade the strong experimental limits on lv",
    ", these symmetry arguments should forbid the appearance of the dimension-3 and -4 operators , or at least make them scale like @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , where @xmath12 is e.g. the scale of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath13 .",
    "remarkably , for lv in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the lowest dimension for lv operators is 5  @xcite , so that lv is suppressed by at least one power of the high - energy scale .",
    "a similar suppression of dimension-3 and -4 operators occurs when we construct the effective chiral lagrangian that is induced by dimension-5 operators in the lv qcd lagrangian .    in ref .",
    "@xcite all dimension-5 operators were classified that can be built out of sm fields and are restricted by a set of `` uv - safety '' conditions that protect the operators from transmuting into lower - dimensional operators by quantum effects . in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to a subset of the quark and gluon operators listed in ref .",
    "the operators we choose are , for our exploratory purpose , the most interesting ones from the point of view of @xmath0pt . other lv qcd operators can be treated in the same way , but we leave this for future work .    at a scale of 1 gev there is a limited set of protected dimension-5 operators in the quark sector .",
    "they are summarized in eq .  (",
    "18 ) of ref .  @xcite . of this set ,",
    "we consider the only two that explicitly contain the gluon field strength @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the gell - mann matrices , are the generators of the @xmath18 color group ) .",

    "our naming of the lv tensors differs from ref .",
    "@xcite , wherin @xmath20 is called @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "although these operators should be considered as part of a theory where the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bosons are already integrated out , one should keep in mind that @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain ( different ) contributions from the same high - energy operators , because of mixing due to @xmath24- and @xmath25-boson loops . lacking a renormalization - group analysis for such operators",
    ", we will here consider @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be independent .",
    "for isospin considerations we split the lagrangian density in eq .   in two parts , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the third pauli matrix .",
    "operators similar to those in eq .   exist that contain the photon field strength @xmath33 instead of the gluon field strength .",
    "some phenomenological effects of these operators are considered in refs .",
    "since we are interested in observables for non - strange baryons , we have focused on operators with up and down quarks only .",
    "our analysis can be extended to include the strange quark and observables with kaons and hyperons .",
    "in addition to the quark operators we consider the only dimension-5 pure - gauge term that satisfies the uv - safety conditions of ref .",

    "the operator @xmath49 can be written as @xmath50 where , here and in the following , the dots represent total - derivative terms and/or terms containing the electromagnetic field strength and higher - order pion terms .",
    "the latter two originate from the commutator of covariant derivatives given by @xmath51n = \\frac{ie}{2}f_{\\mu\\nu}(1+\\tau_3)n + { \\rm pion\\ terms}\\ .\\ ] ] all terms in this expression raise the chiral index by two with respect to terms without the commutator . for convenience ,",

    "we get on the one hand that @xmath62 on the other hand , if we use partial integration to let the covariant derivative act on @xmath63 , we get that @xmath64 therefore , on - shell and up to terms of higher chiral order and a total derivative , @xmath65 .    for operators of the form @xmath66 ,",
    "the equation of motion gives @xmath67 using partial integration to let the covariant derivative in @xmath68 act on @xmath63 , then using the equation of motion and one more partial integration , we can also write @xmath66 as @xmath69 combining these two results , we see that @xmath66 is equivalent to @xmath70 the first term is equal to an operator that is already included in the effective chiral lagrangian , while the other terms are of higher order .",
    "in addition to @xmath71 , as mentioned in table  [ tab : tforms ] , @xmath66 also corresponds to operators that could be included in eq .  .",
    "this is the case if we replace @xmath53 by a contraction of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "using the analysis above it is then easy to show that such operators are equivalent to the one displayed in eq .  .",
    "this shows that all operators in this appendix are redundant up to higher - order operators with the correct chiral transformation properties .",
    "in other words , if we would want to extend the chiral lagrangian to include higher - order operators , we would not need to reconsider the operators in eqs .  .",
