    "it should be noted that the fermi liquid states always dominate the low temperature physics of this system because the resistivity was found to follow @xmath12 law in both isotropic and nematic phases .",

    "when approaching quantum critical points , not only the zero temperature electronic ground state but also the low - temperature properties are modified radically .",
    "pioneering theoretical works done by hertz@xcite and extended by millis@xcite have addressed the physics near the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic quantum critical points , showing that the critical fluctuations are scale invariant in the vicinity of quantum critical points due to the divergence of the correlation length right at these points .",

    "these findings have posted a challenge to understand the critical behavior in this material .    in this article , we show that the tight - binding model derived by arovas and two of us@xcite together with the on - site interactions treated simply at the mean - field level already gives rise to divergences in these properties without involving quantum fluctuations .",

    "the reason why the small energy scale like zeeman energy ( @xmath115 ) can push the system to get closer to the van hove singularities at energies far away from the fermi energy is the help of the metamagnetism .",

    "experimentally , it has been concluded from the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements@xcite that the resistive anisotropy disappears very quickly as the magnetic field is tilted away from the @xmath17-axis , suggesting that the nematic ordering vanishes with the increase of the field angle @xmath50 .",

    "the point is that the nematic phase is mostly associated with the states near the van hove singularity whose fermi velocities are too small to have sizable contribution to the transport properties . therefore the observed anisotropic resistivity is mostly likely due to the scatterings between nematic domains , and the tilt of the magnetic field helps lie up the domains .",
    "however , if the domains are fully lied up , the resistivity measurement becomes insensitive to the nematic phase due to the diminishing scatterings between nematic domains , despite the nematic order could be stronger .",

    "the white oval represents the wave function of @xmath9 orbital on each site .",
    "the current flows much more easily along @xmath145-axis than @xmath142-axis since the electrons suffer less domain scatterings hopping along this direction . as the in - plane magnetic field is strong , these high - energy domains vanish , thus there is no longer an easy axis for the current flow . ]",
    "one remaining puzzle of this domain scattering argument is why the easy axis for the current flow is perpendicular to the in - plane component of the @xmath72-field @xcite .",
    "we provide a natural argument based on the anisotropic spatial extension of the domain walls as explained below . assuming the @xmath72-field lying in the @xmath49-plane , the in - plane @xmath146 orbital zeeman energy reads @xmath147 , which couples the @xmath10 and @xmath8-orbitals and breaks the degeneracy between the @xmath8 and @xmath9-orbitals .",
    "since the @xmath10-orbital has lower on - site energy due to the crystal field splitting than that of @xmath8 , the @xmath8-orbital bands are pushed to higher energy than @xmath9-orbital bands by this extra coupling . as a result , the nematic state with preferred @xmath9-orbitals ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) has lower energy in the homogeneous system . at small angles of @xmath50 ,",
    "domains with preferred @xmath8-orbitals ( i.e. @xmath144 ) could form as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] ( a ) as meta - stable states , which occupy less volume than the majority domain of @xmath143 .",
    "let us consider the shape of the domain walls . because of the quasi-1d features of the @xmath8 and @xmath9-orbitals , the horizontal ( vertical ) domain wall breaks the bonds of the @xmath148-orbital as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] ( b ) , respectively . since the @xmath9-orbital is preferred by @xmath149 , the horizontal domain wall costs more energy .",
    "consequently , the domain structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] ( a ) with longer vertical walls than the horizontal walls is energetically favored .",
    "since the electrons suffer less domain scatterings hopping along the @xmath145-axis in this domain structure , it becomes the easy axis for the current flow . at large values of @xmath50 ,",
    "higher energy domains are suppressed and eventually vanish , and thus the resistivity measurement becomes insensitive to the nematic phase because of vanishing of the domain scatterings .",
    "our results have posted a possibility that the nematic order could occur in a larger range of the magnetic field for @xmath150 than for @xmath151 .",
    "detection methods other than resistivity would be desirable . one feasible way is to measure the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) in the spectroscopic imaging stm which has been examined in detail in our previous work@xcite .",
    "it has been predicted by us that if there is a nematic order , qpi spectra will manifest patterns breaking rotational symmetry .",
    "another possible experiment is the nuclear quadruple resonance ( nqr ) measurement , which has been widely used to reveal ordered states in high-@xmath122 cuprates@xcite and recently the iron - pnictides@xcite .",
    "this technique utilizes the feature that a nucleus with a nuclear spin @xmath152 has a non - zero electric quadruple moment .",
    "because the electric quadruple moment creates energy splittings in the nuclear states as a electric field gradient is present , a phase transition could be inferred if substantial changes in the resonance peak are observed in the nqr measurement .",
    "besides , since this is a local probe at the atomic level , it is highly sensitive to the local electronic change . given that ru atom has a nuclear spin of @xmath153@xcite and the orbital ordering in the quasi-1d bands significantly changes the charge distribution around the nuclei , a systematic nqr measurement as functions of magnetic field and field angle will reveal more conclusive information about nematicity .",
    "in this paper we have shown that a number of important properties observed in the bilayer sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 could be qualitatively consistent with a realistic tight - binding model together with on - site interactions treated at mean - field level .",
    "the band structure of this material is complicated by multibands , bilayer splitting , rotations of ruo octahedra , and the spin - orbit coupling , collectively leading to the high sensitivity to the small energy scales .",
    "this is the main cause of the singular behavior in the evolution of the fermi surfaces under magnetic field . using our tight - binding model and the standard mean - field approaches on the intra- and inter- orbital hubbard interactions",
    ", we find that for the case of magnetic field parallel to the @xmath17-axis , the nematic order , which is interpreted as the orbital ordering in quais-1d @xmath9 and @xmath8 bands , appears at the magnetic field at the same order of the experimental values @xmath5 8 t .",
    "moreover , we find that the total density of states at the fermi energy @xmath11 under the magnetic field does not follow a rigid band picture , in agreements with the results of stm measurement@xcite .",
    "the failure of following a rigid band picture is essentially a consequence of the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman energy , despite the strong correlation effect could also result in the violation of the rigid band shift upon doping@xcite .",
    "because the spin - orbit coupling hybridizes the quasi-1d bands and 2-d bands with _ opposite _ spins , the zeeman energy naturally induces the reconstruction of the fermi surfaces instead of just rigid chemical potential shifts .",
    "this singular behavior in @xmath11 also results in the divergences in the entropy and specific heat landscapes , since at very low temperature both quantities are approximately proportional to @xmath11 . because the divergence observed by rost _ el .",
    "al._@xcite start approximately at 6 - 7 tesla which is not very close to the quantum critical point residing about 8 tesla , a direct application of the quantum critical scaling seems to be inappropriate .",
    "the explanation of the critical exponent associated with this divergence could not be complete without taking the band structure singularity into account in this particular material @xcite .    as the magnetic field is tilted away from the @xmath17 axis ( @xmath54 ) , we find that nematic region expands instead of shrinking as the resistivity measurement has indicated . from the theoretical viewpoints ,",
    "the tilt of the magnetic field induces an extra in - plane component of the orbital zeeman energy which explicitly breaks the @xmath132 symmetry down to the @xmath133 symmetry .",
    "as argued above that this system is very sensitive to small energy scale , the effect of this extra zeeman energy is not important at low field but could amplify the effect of interaction to drive the system toward nematicity as the quantum critical point is approached . as a result ,",
    "the nematic phase is more favored and stable in the presence of the in - plane magnetic field and it requires another fermi surface reconstruction at even higher magnetic field in order to weaken the nematic phase by reduced @xmath11 .    to explain this discrepancy between our theory and the resistivity measurement",
    ", we adopt the domain scattering argument proposed by raghu _ et .",
    "furthermore , we have given an explanation for another experimental puzzle that the easy axis for the current flow is always perpendicular to the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "measurements like quasiparticle interference in the spectroscopic imaging stm and nqr which could detect the orbital ordering directly have been proposed to be more reliable probes for the nematicity in this material than the resistivity measurement .",
    "finally we would like to comment on limitation of the present theory .",
    "although we have found the re - entry behavior of the nematic phase , i.e. , the appearance of the nematic phase only at the finite temperature but not at the zero temperature , near the upper - field boundary , the experiments showed this behavior near both upper- and lower- field boundary .",
    "in our calculations , the re - entry behavior is due to the increase of the density of states within the narrow energy window around the fermi energy opened by thermal energy , but we do not reject other schemes for the re - entry behavior .",
    "one possible scheme is an analogue of ferromagnetism without exchange splitting proposed by hirsch@xcite .",
    "he showed that the nearest neighbor interactions could result in a spin - dependent renormalization on the bandwidth ( equivalently , the effective mass ) . as a result ,",
    "the filling for different spin bands can be different because of the unequal effective masses , leading to the ferromagnetism even without the exchange splitting as in the stoner model .    in hirsch s original paper ,",
    "the re - entry of the ferromagnetism at higher temperature was found .",
    "since we only considered the on - site interactions in our model , such an effect is beyond the scope of the current theory .",
    "it is possible that after including the nearest neighbor interaction , the renormalizations of the bandwidths have novel temperature - dependences , leading to a phase diagram better consistent with the experiments .",
    "if this is the correct scheme , the re - entry of the nematic states should be accompanied by a change in the kinetic energy due to the effective mass renormalization , which could be examined by the sum rules for the optical properties @xcite .",
    "another possible scheme for the re - entry behavior is the quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "it is well - known that the influences of the critical fluctuations extend from the quantum critical point to finite temperature in a @xmath154-shape region in the phase diagram .",
    "moreover , the critical fluctuations in this material contain not only the ferromagnetic but also the nematic ones . as a result",
    ", it is not surprising that the competition between these two types of critical fluctuations leads to a intriguing phase diagram at the finite temperature , and the study toward this direction is currently in progress .",
