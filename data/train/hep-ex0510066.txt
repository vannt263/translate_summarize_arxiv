    "in flavor-@xmath10 , the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons belong to the same pseudoscalar nonet . the physical states @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to the @xmath14-octet state @xmath15 and the @xmath14-singlet state @xmath16 , via the usual mixing formulae : @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pseudoscalar mixing angle  @xcite . the conventional estimate of @xmath20 mixing uses the quadratic mass matrix @xmath21 where @xmath22 is given by the gell - mann - okubo mass formula .",
    "diagonalization of this matrix gives @xmath23 with a linear mass matrix and the linear gell - mann - okubo mass formula @xmath24 , @xmath19 is computed to be about @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle has been measured experimentally in different ways , and the value is around @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "one of these measurements is based on @xmath2 radiative decays . in the limit where the ozi rule and @xmath14 symmetry are exact , one gets  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the momenta of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the @xmath2 center of mass system ( cms ) .",
    "the first - order perturbation theory  @xcite expression for the partial width @xmath30 is @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wave functions at the origin of the @xmath2 and the pseudoscalar with mass @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the charge of the charmed quark . the pseudoscalar helicity amplitude @xmath36 depends on @xmath37 ; numerically @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",

    "the value of @xmath44 determined from the same formula disagrees with measurements .",
    "some models that assign a small admixture of @xmath12 and @xmath13 to other states have been proposed to explain the large value of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "for example , ref .",

    "a precision measurement of @xmath51 could distinguish between these mixing models , as well as provide a determination of the mixing angle @xmath19 .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath52 and @xmath53 were reported by the desy - heidelberg group  @xcite , the crystal ball  @xcite , markiii  @xcite and dm2  @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath54 is suppressed because the photon can only be radiated from the final state quarks .",
    "this branching fraction was measured by dasp  @xcite and crystal ball  @xcite ; the average of the measurements , @xmath55  @xcite , is in agreement with the vmd prediction @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the qcd multipole expansion theory  @xcite predicts a value of @xmath57 .    in this paper , @xmath54 is studied using @xmath58 decay , @xmath59 is measured using @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath58 , and @xmath43 is studied using @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath60 .",
    "the analyses use a data sample that contains @xmath65 @xmath2 decays collected with the updated beijing spectrometer ( besii ) operating at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) .",

    "particle identification is accomplished using specific ionization ( @xmath69 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) information from a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath69 resolution is @xmath70 ; the tof resolution for bhabha events is @xmath71 ps . radially outside of the time - of - flight counters is a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas tubes interleaved with lead sheets .",
    "the bsc measures the energy and direction of photons with resolutions of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 in gev ) , @xmath74 mrad , and @xmath75 cm .",
    "the iron flux - return of the magnet is instrumented with three double layers of proportional counters that are used to identify muons .",
    "a geant3-based monte carlo simulation package  @xcite , which simulates the detector response including interactions of secondary particles in the detector material , is used to determine detection efficiencies and mass resolutions , optimize selection criteria , and estimate backgrounds .",
    "reasonable agreement between data and mc simulation is observed for various calibration channels , including @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "in the @xmath82 decay mode , there are no charged tracks in the final states . each candidate event is required to have three and only three photon candidates ; the mc indicates that the number of these decays that produce final states with more than three photon candidates is negligible .",
    "a photon candidate is defined as a cluster in the bsc with an energy deposit of more than 50 mev , and with an angle between the development direction of the cluster and the direction from the interaction point to the first hit layer of the bsc that is less than 20@xmath83 .",
    "if two clusters have an opening angle that is less than 10@xmath83 or have an invariant mass that is less than 50 mev@xmath84 , the lower energy cluster is regarded as a remnant from the other and not a separate photon candidate . a kinematic fit that conserves energy and momentum",
    "is applied to the three photon candidates , and @xmath85 is required .",
    "we also require @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the polar angle of a decay photon in the pseudoscalar s cms ( shown in fig .",
    "1a ) , and @xmath89 is the minimum angle between any two of the three photon candidates ( shown in fig .",
    "this rejects background from the continuum @xmath90 process .",
    "figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution in the @xmath11 mass region of the two photon candidates that have the smallest opening angle .",
    "a peak at the @xmath11 mass is evident .    from mc studies , background channels that produce a peak in the @xmath11 signal region come mainly from channels with @xmath92 final states , such as @xmath93 , via the @xmath94 , @xmath95 etc .",
    "( @xmath96s violates c - parity ) .",
    "these background sources are studied using events where the number of photon candidates in the event is four .",
    "four photon events are selected and subjected to a four - constraint kinematic fit to @xmath82 , using any three of the four photons ; the three - photon combination with the smallest @xmath97 is selected for the background study .",
    "figure  3 shows the invariant mass distribution for the two photons with the smallest opening angle from four - photon events .",
    "a peak is observed in the @xmath11 mass region that agrees with expectations from mc simulations that include all known modes that produce @xmath92 final states .",
    "however , since the known background channels do not account for the level of the observed background in the data sample , a scale factor is introduced to scale the mc background predictions for fits to the distribution in fig .  2 .",
    "the scale factor depends strongly on which intermediate states are considered for @xmath98 decays ; the difference between the scale factors determined from different channels is treated as a systematic uncertainty of the background subtraction .",
    "figure 2 is fit with a mc - simulated @xmath54 histogram for the signal , a mc - simulated @xmath98 background shape , as well as a shape of mc simulated phase space for other sources of backgrounds .",
    "the number of @xmath99 events determined from the fit is @xmath100 .",

    "the mc - determined detection efficiency is @xmath106 .",
    "since the momentum of the @xmath13 is lower than that of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath2 radiative decays , the angle between the two @xmath13 decay photons is not small enough to be useful for distinguishing them from the radiative photon . for this channel , the mass distribution of the three @xmath103 combinations for each event",
    "are plotted in fig . 5 , where an @xmath13 signal is evident above a smooth background due to wrong @xmath103 combinations plus other background sources .",
    "a fit to the data points , with the mc simulated mass distribution for the @xmath107 decay including combinatorial background for the signal and a second order legendre polynomial for background between 0.8 and 1.2 @xmath108 , yields @xmath109 entries .",

    "the combinatorial background is about @xmath112 for both data and mc simulation , and they cancel out when the @xmath113 is divided by the efficiency @xmath114 in the branching fraction calculation .      in this final states , there are two charged particles @xmath116 and @xmath117 and three photons .",
    "candidate events are required to satisfy the following common selection criteria :    1 .",
    "two good charged tracks with net charge zero .",
    "each track must have a good helix fit , a transverse momentum larger than 60 mev / c , and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the polar angle of the track , and must originate from the interaction region .",

    "3 .   at least three photon candidates are required .",
    "the photon identification is similar to that used in the @xmath82 analysis , except that the angle between a cluster and any other cluster must be greater than @xmath124 , and the angle between the cluster and any charged track must be greater than @xmath125 .",
    "these differences reflect different sources of fake photons .",
    "a four - constraint kinematic fit is applied to all three - photon combinations plus the two charged tracks assuming @xmath115 .",
    "the three - photon combination with the smallest @xmath97 is selected , and the @xmath97 of the kinematic fit is required to be less than 20 .    the events that survive these selection criteria with an invariant mass in the range @xmath126 are assumed to come from either @xmath12 or @xmath13 decays , and the other photon is considered to be the radiative photon .",
    "figure 6 shows a scatterplot of @xmath110 versus @xmath127 for the selected events .",
    "clear @xmath12 and @xmath13 signals corresponding to @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are observed .      after the requirement that the @xmath103 invariant mass is in the @xmath11 mass region ( @xmath131~\\hbox{gev}/c^2 $ ] , @xmath132 ) , a clear @xmath12 signal is evident in the @xmath133 invariant mass distribution shown in fig .",

    ".    a similar fit as for @xmath61 yields @xmath140 @xmath13 events ; the mc - determined detection efficiency for @xmath141 , and @xmath60 is @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath43 is also studied using the @xmath63 decay channel . for this study , the @xmath144 and photon selection requirements are the same as used for the @xmath115 final state , and the event selection is similar , except that here at least two photons are required in the event .",
    "the photons and charged tracks are kinematically fitted to @xmath143 assuming four - momentum conservation , and @xmath85 is required .",

    "the efficiency for photon i d is discussed in ref .",
    "it is found that the relative efficiency difference between data and mc simulation for high energy photon detection is about 0.8% per photon , while for low energy photons , the difference is around 2% per photon .",
    "since the energy of the radiative photon in @xmath149 , and @xmath1 is high , and the energies of the photons from pseudoscalar particle decays are low , the total systematic error due to photon i d is taken as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the number of photons from the pseudoscalar particle decay .",

    "a clean charged @xmath120 sample obtained from @xmath152 without the use of particle i d is used to study data - mc differences between particle i d efficiencies for different momentum ranges . since only one of the two charged tracks",
    "is required to be identified as a pion , the mc simulates data rather well ; it is found that the mc simulation agrees with data within 0.2% for both @xmath115 and @xmath143 modes .",
    "samples of @xmath152 and @xmath153 events selected without using kinematic fits are used to study the systematic error associated with the four - constraint kinematic fit . for the @xmath85 criteria ,",
    "the difference of kinematic fit efficiencies between data and mc simulation is less than 1.2% for @xmath154 , and 2.4% for @xmath153 . extrapolating these differences to the channels reported here ,",
    "we conservatively assign a 4% systematic error to the kinematic fit efficiency .",
    "there is a slight difference of the mass resolution between mc simulation and data .",
    "when the histogram shape of invariant mass distribution from mc simulation is used to fit the invariant mass distribution of data , it introduces some systematic error .",
    "the high statistics decay channels @xmath102 , @xmath155 and @xmath147 are used to study this source of systematic error . for these channels ,",
    "we allow the mass resolution to vary in the fit to the invariant mass distributions , and we also determine the number of signal events by subtracting side - band - estimated backgrounds .",
    "the resulting branching fractions change by at most 1.6% , 0.1% , and 0.6% for @xmath102 , @xmath141 , and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "we assign 1.6% , 0.1% and 0.6% as the systematic errors due to mass resolution uncertainties for the @xmath82 , @xmath115 and @xmath143 decay modes , respectively .      in @xmath54 ,",
