    "materials known as martensites undergo first - order , diffusionless structural transformations from one crystal phase ( austenite ) to another , usually a twinned , phase ( martensite ) due to shear strains .",
    "a subclass of these materials with displacive transformations exhibits the shape memory effect @xcite .",
    "this effect refers to the existence of a residual strain upon unloading that can be recovered on heating to the high temperature austenite phase . in the austenite phase , these materials exhibit pseudoelastic behavior where a plateau in the stress - strain curves is observed ; however , there is no residual strain as the macroscopic deformation is completely recovered when the load is removed .",
    "interestingly , these unusual mechanical properties of shape memory alloys do not involve any plastic effects such as those caused by dislocation motion but are entirely due to the intrinsic elastic nonlinearities . as a consequence of these unique properties ,",
    "shape memory materials have many technological applications @xcite .",
    "some examples include niti , fepd , aucd and copper - based ternary alloys , e.g. cuauzn .",
    "most commercial applications of shape memory alloys make use of polycrystalline specimens and therefore it is important to compare the mechanical response of polycrystals to that of single crystals .",
    "the problem of finding the effective properties of martensitic polycrystals has been studied by analytical methods @xcite and finite element simulations @xcite . however , these methods do not account for the complex polycrystal geometry and also do not incorporate the long - range elastic interactions between the grains .",
    "continuum simulations that span a range of length scales are good candidates to describe these issues .",
    "recently , phase - field micro - elasticity models that employ static grains created by the voronoi construction have been studied @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to regard the grain orientation as a thermodynamic variable since a polycrystal , in reality , is a metastable state that is formed by a grain growth process . in the present work",
    ", we attempt to account for this metastability of a polycrystal .",
    "the evolution of grains during grain growth has been studied using the phase - field approach @xcite .",
    "although these models correctly describe the grain morphologies and domain coarsening , they do not address the issues of elasticity and crystal symmetry .",
    "a coupling of these models with continuum elasticity models of martensitic transformations provides a framework to model mechanical properties of shape memory polycrystals .",
    "here we propose a model in which elastic strains are coupled to a phase - field model through an orientation field that is determined from a multi - component order parameter describing the crystal orientations . due to this coupling , the strains as well as",
    "the grain orientations can change under an external load . in section 2",

    "our main findings are summarized in section 4 .",
    "a landau theory for shape memory materials was first proposed by falk @xcite .",
    "this one dimensional model captures the salient physics of a number of experimentally observed features of martensites .",
    "however , the model does not incorporate the elastic long - range interactions that are crucial to describe the microstructure of martensites .",

    "figure 1 shows that for a homogeneous system , the transformation free energy @xmath120 for @xmath119 gpa has a local maximum at @xmath121 and two degenerate global minima . in the absence of applied stress ( @xmath114 ) ,",
    "the arrested polycrystal evolves into a domain pattern of the variants of the martensitic phase ( there is no austenite present since @xmath121 is unstable ) .",
    "the strains in each grain as well as the orientation of the martensitic domain walls ( i.e. twin boundaries ) are determined by the orientation of the grain .",
    "this behavior is clear from figure 2(a ) that shows the distribution of the strain @xmath122 ( deviatoric strain relative to the global frame of reference ) and figure 2(b ) that shows the local orientation @xmath123 .",

    "we point out that the average strains for this configuration are very small and correspond to a system with no macroscopic deformation .    to simulate mechanical loading , an external tensile stress @xmath58",
    "is applied quasi - statically , i.e. , starting from the unstressed configuration of figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) , the applied stress @xmath58 is increased in steps of @xmath126 mpa , after allowing the configurations to relax for @xmath127 time steps after each increment .",
    "the loading is continued till a maximum stress of @xmath128 mpa is reached .",
    "thereafter , the system is unloaded by decreasing @xmath58 to zero at the same rate at which it was loaded",
    ". figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) relate to a stress level of @xmath129 mpa during the loading process .",
    "the favored variants ( red domains in the left panel ) have started to grow at the expense of the unfavored variants ( blue domains in the left panel ) .",
    "the orientation distribution @xmath123 in figure 2(d ) has not changed much . as the stress level is increased further ,",
    "the favored variants grow .",
    "even at the maximum stress of @xmath130 mpa , some unfavored variants persist , as is clear from figure 2(e ) ( in fact , further application of stress does not remove such structures as the unfavored variants are in a `` locked '' state due to intergranular constraints ) .",
    "we note that the grains with large misorientation with the loading direction rotate , as is clear by comparing figure 2(f ) with figure 2(b ) and figure 2(d ) , where we can observe that dark red colored grains have turned orange , indicating rotation of those grains .",
    "grains with lower misorientation do not undergo significant rotation .",
    "this rotation is due to the tendency of the system to maximize the transformation strain in the direction of loading so that the total free energy is minimized . within the grains that rotate , sub - grain bands with slightly higher values of the orientation",
    "@xmath123 are present .",
    "these bands correspond to the unfavored strain variants that still survive .",
    "figure 2(g ) and 2(h ) show the situation after unloading to @xmath114 . upon removing the load , a domain structure",
    "is nucleated again due to the local strain gradients at the grain boundaries and the surviving unfavored variants in the loaded polycrystal configuration in figure 2(e ) .",
    "this domain structure is not the same as that prior to loading ( figure 2(a ) ) and thus there is an underlying hysteresis .",
    "the unloaded configuration has non - zero average strain .",
    "this average strain is recovered by heating to the austenite phase , as per the shape memory effect .",
    "figure 2(h ) shows that the orientation distribution reverts to its preloading state as the grains rotate back when the load is removed . to show the rotation of grains more clearly , we plot in figure 3 the change in orientation @xmath131 for @xmath128 mpa",
    "it is clear by comparing this figure with figure 2(b ) that only grains with large misorientations with the loading axis ( @xmath22 ) rotate in order to decrease the misorientation . in some of these rotating grains ,",
    "we observe bands where the misorientation has increased . as discussed earlier ,",
    "these bands correspond to regions where the unfavored variants do not disappear even at high stresses .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the intergranular constraints .",
    "we compare the above mechanical behavior of the polycrystal to the corresponding single crystal .",
    "a single crystal simulation is set up with exactly the same elastic free energy parameters as the polycrystal case but the orientation is fixed at @xmath22 .",
    "loading conditions are also identical to the polycrystal case .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of the martensitic variants during the loading - unloading cycle for the single crystal .",
    "figure 4(a ) , shows the simulated microstructure ( @xmath113 ) prior to loading , with domain wall orientations at @xmath132 or @xmath133 everywhere .",
    "in contrast , the domain wall orientations change from grain to grain in the polycrystal case depicted in figure 2(a ) .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the domain patterns for a stress @xmath129 mpa .",
    "we see that the favored variants ( red domains ) grow at the expense of the unfavored variants ( blue domains ) .",
    "this growth continues , as shown in figure 4(c ) ( @xmath134 mpa ) and figure 4(d ) ( @xmath135 mpa ) . finally , in figure 4(e )",
    "( @xmath128 mpa ) all unfavored variants disappear and we obtain a single domain , in contrast to the polycrystal case at the same stress level ( figure 2(e ) ) where unfavored variants persist . upon unloading ,",
    "the single crystal remains in a single domain state ( figure 4(f ) ) .",
    "this is because there are no inhomogeneities or thermal noise in the simulations to cause renucleation of the domain structure and so the system remains in the positive strain minimum homogeneously .",
    "the unloaded polycrystal , however , reverts to the domain pattern ( figure 2(g ) ) .",
    "this also shows that , unlike the single crystal case , the mechanical behavior of the polycrystal is not necessarily governed by @xmath136 but by a more complex inhomogeneous free energy landscape .",
    "a consequence of this is that the residual strain for a single crystal @xcite will be larger than that for a polycrystal @xcite .",
    "the stress - strain curves corresponding to figure 2 and figure 4 are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the residual strain for the polycrystal ( @xmath137 ) is smaller than that for the single crystal ( @xmath138 ) due to an effective averaging over different orientations and nucleation of domains at grain boundaries upon unloading . also , the change in the stress - strain curve for the polycrystal is not abrupt because the response of the polycrystal is averaged over all grain orientations .",
    "we now discuss cases where the material exists in the austenite phase prior to loading .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 gpa correspond to this situation . for @xmath141 gpa ,",
    "the austenite @xmath142 is a metastable local minimum and there are two stable martensitic minima .",
    "figure 6(a ) and 6(b ) show the situation for @xmath114 .",
    "since there are no nucleation mechanisms in the present simulations , the system remains in an austenite phase @xmath142 in all the grains .",
    "loading is simulated in exactly the same manner as for the @xmath119 case . in figure 6(c ) and figure 6(d ) we observe that a stress induced transformation has heterogeneously occured in all the grains ( @xmath143 mpa ) ( although no local stresses have been introduced in the model , the heterogeneous nucleation occurs due to the strain gradients at the grain boundaries which act as embryos for the transformation ) .",
    "the transformed regions are represented by yellow / red shades whereas the untransformed austenite regions are represented by light green shades .",
    "some grains also show the presence of the unfavored variant @xmath144 represented by dark green and blue shades .",
    "figure 6(d ) shows that at this stress level , the texture is the same as for the unloaded configuration .",
    "at the maximum stress ( figure 6(e ) ) @xmath128 mpa , most of the system has transformed although some austenite and the unfavored variant domains remain . as in the earlier case ,",
    "grains with higher misorientation have also rotated ( figure 6(f ) ) . upon unloading , for this case also some of the unfavored domains reappear , as can be seen in figure 6(g ) .",
    "figure 6(h ) shows that the texture returns to its preloading state .",
    "next , we consider the case @xmath145 gpa for which @xmath121 is the global minimum and there are two metastable martensitic minima . for this case ,",
    "the  arrested \" polycrystal exists in the austenite phase before loading .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure 7(a ) where the strain @xmath61 is close to zero everywhere .",
    "the corresponding orientation distribution is shown in figure 7(b ) .",
    "the system is loaded at an identical loading rate as in the earlier cases .",
    "figure 7(c ) shows the spatial distribution of @xmath61 at a load of @xmath143 mpa .",
    "stress induced _ martensitic transformation from the square phase to the rectangular phase takes place heterogeneously , as can be seen from the transformed regions ( yellow / red shades ) that are embedded in a matrix of the untransformed austenite ( green / blue shades ) . figure 7(d ) shows that at this stress level , the orientation distribution does not change appreciably .",
    "upon loading further to @xmath128 mpa , the transformed phase grows although the austenite phase is locally retained in some regions ( figure 7(e ) ) .",
    "similar to the earlier cases , transformation accommodating grain rotations are also observed for this case , as seen in figure 7(f ) . when the load is removed , the domain structure shown in figure 7(g ) is observed . here",
    ", most of the system reverts to an austenite phase but some martensitic domains ( as yellow streakings ) remain giving rise to a very small residual strain .",
    "figure 7(h ) shows the corresponding orientation distribution that returns to its preloading state .",
    "finally , we discuss the case @xmath146 gpa which delineates a pseudoelastic behavior .",
    "the appropriate free energy shown in figure 1 has only one minimum , corresponding to @xmath121 . for this case as well",
    ", the preloading state is austenite and the strain @xmath61 is very small everywhere , as seen in figure 8(a ) .",
    "the corresponding orientation distribution is shown in figure 8(b ) .",
    "nucleation of martensitic variants in the austenite matrix can be observed in figure 8(c ) , corresponding to @xmath143 .",
    "figure 8(d ) shows that the orientation distribution associated with this stress does not change much . as the stress",
    "is further increased to @xmath128 mpa , most of the system is transformed to ( stress induced ) martensite , as shown in figure 8(e ) .",
    "rotations of grains with large misorientation with the loading axis are observed for this case also ( figure 8(f ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath119 gpa and @xmath145 gpa cases , this system reverts to a homogeneous austenite phase upon unloading ( figure 8(g ) ) , i.e. there is no residual strain .",
    "thus , this case shows pseudoelasticity .",
    "the grain rotations are also recovered upon unloading , as seen in figure 8(h ) .",
    "we have also simulated the single crystal loading - unloading cycle corresponding to figures 6 , 7 and 8 . unlike the @xmath119 gpa case discussed in figure 3",
    ", the system always remains in a single domain state during the loading and unloading .",
    "this is because there are no nucleation mechanisms in the single crystal cases to create twin boundaries .",
    "a stress induced martensitic transformation occurs homogeneously at a critical load , for all these cases . upon unloading ,",
    "there is no renucleation of the twinned state .",
    "the stress - strain curves corresponding to figures 6 , 7 and 8 are depicted in figure 9 .",
    "the corresponding single crystal curves are also shown .",
    "it is clear that the residual strain decreases as the elastic constant @xmath91 ( or the temperature ) increases .",
    "it is also seen that the residual strains for the polycrystal simulations corresponding to @xmath141 gpa and @xmath145 gpa are smaller than their single crystal counterparts due to averaging over different orientations and nucleation mechanisms that exist in the polycrystal",
    ". however , for the pseudoelastic case ( @xmath146 gpa ) , the residual strains are zero for both the single- and polycrystal cases .",
    "we have proposed a framework to study the mechanical properties of shape memory polycrystals .",
    "we have coupled the elastic free energy for a square to rectangle transition to a phase - field model describing crystal orientations .",
    "this approach can be readily extended to any crystal symmetry and does not require any a priori assumption of grain shapes or microstructure .",
    "the microstructure is governed by the crystal symmetries encoded in the appropriate elastic free energy functional . the long - range elastic interaction between the grains",
    "is also incorporated .",
    "an important feature of the present work is the coupling between the grain orientation and elasticity so that the metastability of the polycrystal may be accounted for within the same framework .",
    "we studied mechanical properties of shape memory polycrystals and single crystals in different temperature regimes .",
    "there are significant differences between the mechanical response of single- and polycrystals . since the mechanical properties of the polycrystal are an average of individual grains , the stress - strain curves are smoother compared to those of the single crystals .",
    "the inhomogeneities in the polycrystal ensure that domain walls influence the mechanical behavior throughout the loading - unloading process .",
    "in the temperature regimes with nonzero residual strain , the unloaded polycrystals not only have reduced strain but also show domain microstructure .",
    "in contrast , the simulated defect free single crystals exhibit no such patterns after unloading and have much higher residual strains .",
    "our findings are consistent with the fact that in general , polycrystals have poor shape memory properties in comparison to single crystals @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our findings apply to materials where the symmetry change due to the transformation is not particularly large and the number of low symmetry variants is relatively small ( for example materials that show a cubic to tetragonal transformation ) . materials such as niti , which undergo a cubic to monoclinic transformation have a relatively larger symmetry change and larger number of low symmetry variants . for niti , the differences between shape memory behavior of polycrystals and single crystals is not significant .",
    "thus , the issues of how well strain is accommodated and how favored are the variants can play a role in determining the shape memory properties . clearly , further investigation of this aspect is required .",
    "the simulations also predict that grains with a large misorientation with the loading direction can undergo reversible rotations , even in the absence of plastic flow .",
    "the magnitude of the rotation is very small in the linear elastic regime and significant rotation occurs only after the transformation begins .",
    "it is well known that grains can rotate in the plastic regime to accommodate crystallographic slip @xcite . although there are no plastic effects within the present model , there are elastic nonlinearities that couple to the orientation degrees of freedom",
    ". measurements of texture evolution upon loading in niti shape memory alloys have recently been reported @xcite . however , from these experiments , it is not possible to clarify if the rotational mechanism we observed exists .",
    "our simulations suggest that for grains with a high misorientation with the loading axis , in principle , rotation as well as detwinning can occur simultaneously for shape memory polycrystals .",
    "there appears to be an underlying tendency in the polycrystal to decrease the effect of misorientations . based on experiments and finite element simulations , a similar tendency where favorably oriented grains induce the transformation in unfavorably oriented grains , thereby effectively reducing the effect of grain misorientations , has been discussed by gall et al @xcite . since the grain orientations are not fixed in our simulations , this reduction in the effect of misorientations can be achieved by evolution of the transformation strains as well as the grain orientations .",
    "further experiments are needed to clarify to what extent such a mechanism indeed exists in real shape memory polycrystals .",
    "the magnitude of this grain rotation depends on the parameters of the polycrystal phase field model , or on the energy barrier between the grains .",
    "these parameters have been chosen arbitrarily for illustrative purposes in the present simulations .",
    "an estimation of these parameters from experiment or atomistic simulations will be useful for a better comparison with experiments .",

    "<S> we propose a ginzburg - landau theory for the elastic properties of shape memory polycrystals . a single crystal elastic free energy for a system that undergoes a square - to - rectangle transformation is generalized to a polycrystal by introducing a crystal orientational field that is determined from a continuum phase field model . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled system is used to study domain morphology and mechanical properties of shape memory alloys in different temperature regimes . + keywords : shape memory , martensites , polycrystals , stress - strain response , landau theory . </S>"
