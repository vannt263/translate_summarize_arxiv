    "growing evidence suggests that metabolism is a dynamically regulated system that reorganizes under evolutionary pressure to safeguard survival  @xcite .",
    "this adaptability implies that metabolic phenotypes directly respond to environmental conditions .",
    "for instance , unicellular organisms can be stimulated to proliferate by controlling the abundance of nutrients available . in rich media , cells reproduce as quickly as possible by fermenting glucose , a process which produces high specific growth rates as well as large quantities of excess carbon in the form of ethanol and organic acids  @xcite , a process known as the crabtree effect  @xcite . to survive the scarcity of nutrients during starvation periods ,",
    "glycolysis is hypothesized to switch to oxidative metabolism , which no longer maximizes the specific growth rate , but instead the atp yield needed for cellular processes .",
    "cells of multicellular organisms show similar metabolic phenotypes , relying primarily on oxidative phosphorylation when not stimulated to proliferate and changing to non - oxidative glycolytic metabolism during cell proliferation , even if this process known in cancer cells as the warburg effect  @xcite is much less efficient at the level of energy yield .",
    "these metabolic phenotypes are captured by computational approaches like flux balance analysis  @xcite ( fba ) that has been applied to high - quality genome - scale metabolic network reconstructions  @xcite to estimate the fluxes of biochemical reactions at steady state .",
    "compliant with stoichiometric mass balance constraints and with imposed upper and lower bounds for nutrients , fba determines the flux distribution that optimizes a biological objective such as specific growth rate , biomass yield , atp yield or the rate of production of a biotechnologically important metabolite .",
    "this important tool has been used to predict the growth rate of organisms and to analyze their viability  @xcite .",
    "minimization of metabolic adjustment ( moma )  @xcite , which identifies a single suboptimal point in flux space , has been proposed as an alternative option for perturbed metabolic networks not exposed to long - term evolutionary pressure . in any case , the identified solutions are frequently inconsistent with the biological reality since no single objective function describes successfully the variability of flux states under all environmental conditions  @xcite , and in fact the highest accuracy of fba predictions is achieved whenever the most relevant objective function is tailored to particular environmental conditions according to the empirical evidence for a very specific metabolic phenotype .",
    "for instance , fba maximization of growth rate , by far one of the most common assumption , requires either a rich medium or a manual limitation of the oxygen uptake to a physiological enzymatic limit to mimic the observed fermentation of glucose to formate , acetate , or ethanol typical of proliferative metabolism , while in minimal medium optimization of growth rate relies primarily on oxidative phosphorylation , which increases atp production converting glucose to carbon dioxide , as in starvation metabolism .    along optimal metabolic phenotypes",
    ", there is however a whole space of possible states non - reachable by invoking optimality principles that prevent non - optimal or typical biological states .",
    "optimization of a biological function in the absence of _ a priori _ biological justification , like what happens under conditions for proliferative or starvation metabolism , may indeed weaken _ in silico _ predictions .",
    "elementary flux modes  @xcite non - decomposable steady - state pathways through a metabolic network such that any possible pathway can be described as a non - negative linear combination of them provide a view on the flux space without the requirement of any optimality function . however , calculation of all elementary flux modes for an entire network is computationally very demanding due to the combinatorial explosion of their number with increasing size of the network  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the core metabolism of _ escherichia coli _ in  @xcite consists of around 271 million elementary flux modes  @xcite . to overcome this handicap , recent advances avoid the comprehensive enumeration of elementary flux modes using instead a sample of the available elementary flux mode solution space  @xcite .",
    "even admitting one is able to enumerate all elementary flux modes , it is however impossible to assess the likelihood of observing a given linear combination of them in a typical phenotype .",
    "further , elementary flux modes can not capture changes associated with reaction fluxes being capped for whichever physiological reason ( fig .",
    "s6 in supporting information ( si ) ) . on top , due to functional redundancy , the expansion of possible metabolic pathways in elementary flux modes is not unique . therefore , enumeration of the elementary flux modes is not as insightful as characterizing the whole phenotypic space , albeit requiring a comparable computational complexity .    here",
    ", we introduce an alternative approach that estimates directly the feasible flux phenotypic ( ffp ) space using a mathematically well characterized sampling technique which enables the analysis of feasible flux states in terms of their likelihood .",
    "we use it to confront optimal growth rate solutions with the whole set of feasible flux phenotypes of _ escherichia coli _",
    "( _ e . coli _ ) core metabolism in minimal medium .",
    "the ffp space provides a reference map that helps us to assess the likelihood of optimal and high - growth states .",
    "we quantitatively and visually show that optimal growth flux phenotypes are eccentric with respect to the bulk of states , represented by the feasible flux phenotypic mean , which suggests that optimal phenotypes are uninformative about the more probable states , most of them low growth rate .",
    "we propose feasible flux phenotypic space eccentricity of experimental data as a standard tool to calibrate the deviation of optimal phenotypes from experimental observations .",
    "finally , the analysis of the entire high - biomass production region of the feasible flux phenotypic space unveils metabolic behaviors observed experimentally but unreachable by models based on optimality principles , which forbid aerobic fermentation -a typical pathway utilization of proliferative metabolism- in minimal medium with unlimited oxygen uptake .",
    "the ffp space , also termed the flux cone  @xcite , of a metabolic model in a specific environment has been explored using different sampling techniques  @xcite . here",
    ", we use the hit - and - run ( hr ) algorithm to explore the ffp space , tailoring it to enhance its sampling rate and to minimize its mixing time .",
    "we refer the interested reader to  @xcite , where our implementation was first introduced , stating here only the key points and ideas .",
    "we start by noticing that all points in the ffp space must simultaneously satisfy mass balance conditions and uptake limits for internal and exchanged metabolites , respectively .",
    "the former requirement defines a set of homogeneous linear equalities , whose solution space is @xmath0 , while the latter defines a set of linear inequalities , whose solutions lie in a convex compact set @xmath1 . from a geometrical point of view , the ffp space is thus given by the intersection @xmath2 .",
    "a key step of our approach consists in realizing that one can directly work in @xmath3 by sampling @xmath1 in terms of a basis spanning @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to retrieve all ffps that satisfy mass balance in the medium conditions under consideration , without rejection .",
    "additionally , sampling in @xmath3 allows to perform a drastic dimensional reduction and to decrease considerably the computation time . indeed , assuming to have @xmath4 reactions , @xmath5 internal metabolites , and @xmath6 exchanged metabolites ( @xmath7 ) , one has that @xmath8 , which is typically a space with greatly reduced dimensionality with respect to @xmath9 .    once a basis for @xmath0 is found , the main idea behind hr is fairly simple .",
    "given a feasible solution @xmath10 , a new , different feasible solution @xmath11 can be obtained as follows :    1 .",
    "choose a random direction @xmath12 in @xmath13 2 .",
    "draw a line @xmath14 through @xmath15 along direction @xmath12 : @xmath16 3 .",

    "s4 in si for an illustrative representation of the algorithm ) . the initial condition , which must be a feasible metabolic flux state itself ( _ i.e. _ it must belong to @xmath3 ) ,",
    "is obtained by other methods .",
    "we used and recommend minover , see  @xcite , but any other technique is valid .",
    "in particular , in cases where small samples of the ffp space have been already obtained by other sampling techniques , such points can be used to feed the hr algorithm and produce a new , larger sample .",
    "it was proven that hr converges towards the uniform sampling of @xmath3  @xcite and we took several measures to ensure that this was the case in our implementation ( fig .",
    "s4 in si ) . for each model , we initially created samples of size @xmath25 , giving rise to a final set of @xmath26 feasible solutions , uniformly distributed along the whole ffp space .",
    "compared to phenotypic optimisation or , _",
    "e.g. _ , elementary flux modes , ffp sampling has the advantage of allowing the computation of reaction pairs correlations .",
    "these may be exploited to detect how global flux variability emerges in the system through principal component ( pc ) analysis@xcite and to quantify , in turn , the closeness of optimal phenotypes to the bulk of the ffp . in what follows",
    "we briefly describe the method , while an illustrative example is provided in fig .",
    "s5 in si .",
    "to perform such study , we start by writing down the matrix @xmath27 of correlations between all reaction pairs @xmath28 . in doing this",
    ", we measure how much the variability of reaction flux @xmath29 affects the flux @xmath30 ( and viceversa ) . in mathematical terms , for each pair of reactions @xmath31 , we have : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes an average over the sampled set and the denominator of the fraction is simply the product of the standard deviations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we plot such matrix in fig.[fig1]e .",
    "matrix @xmath34 is real and symmetric by definition and , thus , diagonalizable .",
    "this means that , for every eigenvector @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 .",
    "note that matrix @xmath34 describes paired flux fluctuations , in a reference frame centered on the mean flux vector . the eigenvectors @xmath35 of @xmath34 express , in turn , the directions along which such fluctuations are taking place .",
    "in particular , the eigenvectors @xmath37 associated with the first two largest ( in modulo ) eigenvalues dictate the two directions in space where the sampled ffp displays the greatest variability ( see fig .",
    "s5 in si ) .",
    "this implies that sampled phenotypes lie closer to the plane spanned by @xmath38 and @xmath39 than the ones produced by any other linear combination of @xmath34 eigenvectors . projecting",
    "all sampled ffp onto this plane allows thus to perform a drastic dimensional reduction yet retaining much of the original variability and allows to have a direct graphical insight on where phenotypes lie , on where the bulk of the ffp is located and on how the fba solution compares to them . in such plot , each phenotype @xmath40 is described by two coordinates , that may be parameterized via a radius @xmath41 and an angle @xmath42 .",
    "since the projection is normalised , it follows that @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the closer @xmath41 to one , the better the phenotype @xmath40 is described by only looking at variability along @xmath37 . as @xmath41 is one at the most and since we have",
    "so many phenotypes clustered together , we chose to plot the pcaprojection by using an effective radius @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig1]f . in this way",
    "we could better discriminate among different phenotypes and got a ` closest to the origin , closest to the @xmath45plane ' setup .    as compared to previous works focused on characterizing the principal components of the solution space to obtain a low - dimensional decomposition of the steady flux states of the system  @xcite , our approach presents two main conceptual differences .",
    "first , the sampling method used here produces a uniform sample over the full set of feasible flux states without introducing any bias towards high - growth flux states .",
    "second , we aim at a full description of all feasible flux states to conduct a statistical analysis of feasible phenotypes , which can not be done by only retaining pcs .",
    "we use pc analysis to visualize the eccentricity of the fba solution , but for all other purposes we take into account the whole set of metabolic states .",

    "this network is complemented with the biomass formation reaction and the atp maintenance reaction . as in fba ,",
    "feasible flux states of a metabolic network are those that fulfill stoichiometric mass balance constraints together with imposed upper and lower bounds on the reaction fluxes .",
    "these constraints restrict the number of solutions to a compact convex set which contains all possible flux steady states in a particular environmental condition . in glucose",

    "note that we allow negative values for reversible reactions .",
    "we apply a fast and efficient hit - and - run algorithm  @xcite ( see materials and methods ) that explores the full solution space at random to produce a raw sample of @xmath50 feasible states from which we extract a final uniform representative set of @xmath51 feasible states .",
    "notice that our approach is suitable for genome - scale network sizes beyond the reduced size of the _ e. coli _ core model .",
    "there is not any fundamental or technical bottleneck that prevents its application to complete metabolic descriptions at the cell level since uniform samples can also be generated in genome - scale networks .",

    "interestingly , we find that this coefficient is significantly anticorrelated with the essentiality of reactions , as observed experimentally  @xcite ( point - biserial correlation coefficient @xmath56 with p - value @xmath57 ) .",
    "this means that essential reactions tend to have a highly concentrated profile of feasible fluxes . besides , and only for the glucose transferase reaction glcpts , we find a zero probability of having a zero flux , which is not surprising as the lower bound given by fva is strictly greater than zero indicating that this reaction is essential for _ e. coli _ core metabolism in glucose minimal medium .",
    "the asymmetry of each profile was characterized by the distance between the more probable flux in the ffp space and the lower flux bound of the flux variability range rescaled by the flux variability range of the reaction ( table s1 in si ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c we show a scatterplot of values for all @xmath49 core reactions .",

    "this indicates that the most probable flux is close to either the lower or upper bound or , conversely , the probability distribution function tends to be quite symmetric .",
    "moreover , we also observe an anticorrelation between the length of the flux range and the position of the most probable flux , so that the closer is this to its maximum value the shorter is the allowed range of fluxes .    in order to assess the likelihood of fba maximization of the biomass reaction ( fba - mbr ) ( or equivalently of the growth rate ) solutions in relation to typical points within the whole ffp space ( typical , in our mathematical / computational context , means statistically representative in relation to the whole set of flux states contained in the ffp space ) , we calculated the average flux value for each reaction , that we named the mean , and compared it to the fba optimal biomass production flux .",
    "the complementary cumulative distribution function of the distances between these two characteristic fluxes rescaled by the flux variability range of reactions is shown in fig .",

    "deviated reactions include for instance excretion of acetate and phosphate exchange . as a summary ,",
    "we conclude that the mean and the fba biomass optimum are rather distant , which suggests that fba optimal states are uninformative about phenotypes in the bulk of states in the ffp space .    to visualize neatly the eccentricity of the fba maximum growth state with respect to the bulk of metabolic flux solutions , we used principal component analysis  @xcite in order to reduce the high - dimensionality of the full flux solution space projecting it onto a two - dimensional plane from the most informative viewpoint ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we took reaction profiles in pairs to calculate the matrix of pearson correlation coefficients measuring their degree of linear association fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ( table s3 in si ) .",
    "note that an ordering of reactions by pathways allows to have a clear visual feedback of intra- and inter - pathway correlations taking place in the core metabolic network , such that clusters of highly correlated reactions appear as bigger darker squares .",
    "the two axes of our projection correspond to the two first principal components of this profile correlation matrix @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which account for most of the variability in profile correlations .",

    "[ fig1]f in polar coordinates , where we applied a negative logarithmic transformation to the radial coordinate for ease of visualization .",
    "we see that the majority of phenotypes have a radius close to zero .",
    "since points closer to the origin are better described by the two principal components , this implies that @xmath38 and @xmath39 capture the largest variability of the sampled ffp .",
    "clearly , the fba optimal growth solution is rather eccentric with respect to typical solutions , with an associated radius of @xmath64 in this representation .",

    "[ fig2]c _ inset_. while fba - mbr is still reproducing well the experimental results of no acetate production in the low succinate uptake region , it can not predict production of acetate at any succinate uptake rate due to the fact that fba - mbr in minimal medium with unlimited oxygen does not capture the enzymatic oxygen limitation .",
    "the fba - mbr solution diverts resources to the production of atp entirely through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway .",
    "thus , it fails to reproduce experimental observations of acetate production in the region of high succinate uptake rates  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most metabolic states in the ffp space are consistent with acetate production , so that in this case the ffp mean turns out as a good predictor of the experimentally observed metabolic behavior .    in summary ,",
    "while fba - mbr predictions seem accurate for low carbon source uptake rate states in minimal medium as seen previously  @xcite , the experimental points diverge from the fba - mbr prediction state when increased values of carbon source uptake rates are considered .",

    "these results are consistent with values reported in  @xcite .",
    "fba privileges energy production by diverting fluxes to oxidative phosphorylation providing maximum energy for growth , so that fba should work worse the less effective the oxidation of the carbon source is for atp synthesis .",
    "this can be explained in terms of departures of energy from substrate catabolism to functions other than growth , like basal maintenance , which become more relevant in relative terms as compared to the total energy production when the energy - to - redox ratios of the carbon substrate are lower @xcite .",

    "we defined this region by setting a minimal threshold for the biomass production of @xmath80 mmol/(gdw@xmath53h )  @xcite , and produced a sampled with a final size of @xmath81 states .",
    "we note that phenotypes in this high - growth sample remain very close to the biomass yield threshold due to the exponential decrease of the number of feasible flux states with increased biomass production , as in the biomass flux profile in fig .",

    ", we identified pathway utilization typical of proliferative microbial metabolism , even when considering a minimal medium and unlimited oxygen uptake . this metabolic behavior is consistent with experimental data  @xcite but it is unreachable by fba models based on optimality principles ( unless optimization is accompanied by auxiliary constraints not assumed in standard fba implementations , like the solvent capacity constraint  @xcite , or by modelization beyond stoichiometric mass balance , introducing for instance thermodynamically feasible kinetics or enzyme synthesis  @xcite ) .",
    "we checked that the by - products can not be explained by fba - mbr in minimal medium with unlimited oxygen supply since , in this optimization framework , metabolic fluxes are basically forced to atp production through oxidative phosphorylation with excretion of co@xmath82 as waste .",
    "however , increasing the oxygen limitation in fba - mbr results in secretion of formate , acetate , and ethanol in that order , with corresponding shifts in metabolic behavior  @xcite .    according to the ffp space of _ e. coli _ core metabolism , we observe that the high - biomass production ffp subsample is characterized by the secretion of small organic acid molecules , even when the supply of oxygen is unlimited .",
    "this fact points to the simultaneous utilization of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to produce biomass and energy and so to suboptimal states .",
    "this observation is supported by results from @xmath83c - metabolic flux analysis in _",
    "e. coli _",
    "@xcite , where repressed oxidative phosphorylation was proposed as responsible for the measured submaximal aerobic growth .",
    "pathway utilization is illustrated in the schematic shown in fig .",

    "figure s3 in si gives results for lactate .",
    "as the levels of glucose and oxygen uptakes are raised , metabolic phenotypes can achieve an increased production of formate , acetate , and ethanol , even though the majority of feasible phenotypes remain at low organic acids production values .",
    "due to the high - growth requirement , oxygen uptake is always high but its variability increases with glucose uptake increase around a value of approximately @xmath84 mmol/(gdw@xmath53h ) , which clusters the majority of high - growth metabolic phenotypes .",

    "most states are concentrated in the range @xmath85 $ ] mmol/(gdw@xmath53h ) .        taken together , these results indicate that , contrarily to fba predictions , a high level of glucose uptake combined with unlimited oxygen can maintain the requirements of proliferative metabolism for biomass formation through aerobic fermentation even in minimal medium . at the same time , additional oxygen uptake diverts glucose back towards more efficient atp production through oxidative phosphorylation .",
    "hence , oxygen has the potential of regulating the glucose metabolic switch in which glucose uptake rates larger than a critical threshold around @xmath86 mmol/(gdw@xmath53h )  @xcite lead to a linearly increasing maximum organic acids by - products production by a gradual activation of aerobic fermentation and a slight decrease of oxidative phosphorylation .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the fba - mbr solution diverts resources to the production of atp entirely through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway , so that the more is the effective potential of the carbon source to recombine with oxygen to produce energy the more convergent will be the _ in silico _ prediction and the observed states .    in order to correct fba in high - growth conditions ,",
    "some investigations restricted the solution space beyond mass balance and uptake bounds through additional thermodynamic , kinetic or physiological constraints , like the solvent capacity constraint quantifying the maximum amount of macromolecules that can occupy the intracellular space  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the objective function implemented in fba has been modified to nonlinear maximization of the atp or biomass yield per flux unit  @xcite .",
    "other models consider constraints beyond stoichiometric mass balance , for instance thermodynamically feasible kinetics or enzyme synthesis  @xcite .",
    "while these fba modifications enhance some predictions , their effectiveness depends on the estimation of kinetic coefficients using empirical or experimental data .",
    "in contrast , the ffp map contains the set of all solutions determined solely on the basis of mass balance and upper and lower bounds for nutrients , and therefore it includes solutions compliant with physiological constraints or with the limitations imposed by complex metabolic regulation  @xcite . in particular , the ffp space naturally displays all high - growth feasible states which show characteristic metabolic behaviors like aerobic fermentation with unlimited oxygen uptake even in minimal medium without the need to determine additional constants .",
    "this aerobic fermentation , apparently inefficient in terms of energy yield as compared to oxidative phosphorylation but demonstrated as a favorable catabolic state for all rapidly proliferating cells with high glucose uptake capacity  @xcite , turns out as a probable metabolic phenotype even in minimal medium . results in this direction have been reported using steady - state @xmath83c - metabolic flux analysis , which has shown that _",

    "the investigation of fba optimal phenotypes in the framework of the ffp map can help to contextualize disease phenotypes in comparison to normal states .",
    "for instance , fba proved suitable for modelling complex diseases like cancer as it assumes that cancer cells maximize growth searching for metabolic flux distributions that produce essential biomass precursors at high rates  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the entire region of high - growth phenotypes will allow to reach and study a variety of suboptimal feasible flux states close to optimality but which can not be reproduced by optimality principles , and so it opens new avenues for the understanding of general and fundamental mechanisms that characterize this disease across subtypes .",
