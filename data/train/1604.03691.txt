    "<S> we investigate photoproduction of charged @xmath0 off the nucleon using @xmath1 regge pole exchanges by considering the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic multipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the ward identity at the @xmath2 vertex is emphasized for current conservation in the process . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath3 exchange with the well - known coupling constants for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we analyze the role of the @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes without model - dependences except for the magnetic moment @xmath8 and electric quadrupole moment @xmath9 @xmath10 taken from theoretical estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the nondiffractive feature of both cross sections is reproduced with a rapid decrease beyond the resonance region by the dominance of @xmath3 exchange over the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections for differential and density matrix elements are presented to compare with existing data . </S>",
    "<S> the parity and photon polarization asymmetries are predicted to demonstrate the apparent roles of the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic multipole moments .    </S>",
    "<S> charged @xmath0 meson , electromagnetic multipole moments , parity asymmetry , photoproduction , regge model    a charged @xmath0-meson has electromagnetic ( em ) multipole moments , where the canonical values for the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments are expected to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the limit of a point - like particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is interesting to investigate photoproduction of charged @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath13 because they provide a testing ground for observing any deviations in the @xmath0-meson em multipole moments from the canonical values due to the substructure of the vector meson .    unlike much studied case of the @xmath14 process featuring diffractive pomeron exchange @xcite , little is known about the production mechanism in the charged process .    in experimental studies , </S>",
    "<S> cross sections were measured for the total , differential , and spin density matrix elements of the @xmath15 process in the energy range of @xmath16 = 2.8 @xmath17 4.8 gev by the lamp2 group @xcite , and at @xmath16 = 9.6 gev by the rochester - cornell collaboration @xcite . in the case of the @xmath18 process , </S>",
    "<S> the total and differential cross sections in the range @xmath16 = 1@xmath175 gev were extracted from the deuteron target by the abbhhm collaboration at desy @xcite . in particular , the data obtained from the latter process had a sharp peak in the cross section , with @xmath19 7 @xmath20b at around @xmath21 1.6 gev and a steep decrease beyond the resonance region in a similar manner to the former process . </S>",
    "<S> hence , both cross sections exhibit the typical features of a nondiffractive process , where photoproduction of the charged @xmath0 is expected to proceed via nonresonant meson exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such a rapid decrease in the cross section over the peak with respect to the photon energy has also been observed in @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 photoproduction measured recently by the jlab @xmath24 clas collaboration @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate charged processes @xmath25 and @xmath18 within the regge framework for @xmath26 exchanges , where we utilize the born approximation amplitude for the gauge invariance of the @xmath27-channel @xmath0 exchange . </S>",
    "<S> existing data regarding the cross sections , including spin density matrix elements , are analyzed without fit parameters because we use no cutoff function for the regge pole exchange . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the coupling constants related to the @xmath27-channel @xmath0 and @xmath3 exchanges are known from the decay width as well as another reaction process , i.e. , pion photoproduction , so the role of @xmath0 with the em multipole moments can be clarified without model dependence .    however , previous studies of this issue were affected by the theoretical limits due to the difficulty establishing gauge invariance for the exchange of charged @xmath0 with the @xmath2 vertex coupling to charge , magnetic dipole , and electric quadrupole moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that an on - shell vertex for the @xmath2 coupling employed in these studies can not satisfy the ward identity , which should be addressed prior to any type of prescription for current conservation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a simplified charge - coupling of the @xmath2 vertex was considered previously in the regge model for the @xmath28 process @xcite . by satisfying gauge invariance </S>",
    "<S> , the model obtained agreement with existing data . + as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the divergence of the @xmath2 vertex should respect the ward identity @xcite , @xmath29 with respect to the propagator chosen in the unitary gauge , @xmath30 and its inverse @xmath31    the identity in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wardid ] ) allows us to derive the charge coupling term in the @xmath32 vertex , i.e. , @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{0.5 cm } + \\kappa_\\rho(k^\\nu g^{\\mu\\alpha}- k^\\alpha g^{\\mu\\nu } ) -{(\\lambda_\\rho+\\kappa_\\rho)\\over 2m^2_\\rho } \\biggl[(q+q)^\\mu k^\\nu k^\\alpha \\nonumber\\\\&&\\hspace{1cm}-{1\\over2}(q+q)\\cdot k(k^\\nu g^{\\mu\\alpha}+k^\\alpha g^{\\mu\\nu } ) \\biggr]\\biggr\\}\\eta_\\alpha(q ) \\epsilon_\\mu(k)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to the conservation of current in a rather simple manner , which is similar to the case of pion photoproduction with the contact term . in this case , </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0-meson magnetic moment with the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath38 is taken from lee and yang @xcite , and the electric quadrupole moment @xmath39 is taken to be gauge - invariant itself according to gross and riska @xcite . for on - shell @xmath2 coupling , i.e. , @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> they are reduced to @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a point - like @xmath0 meson @xcite , as stated earlier . in this study , we select @xmath45 in favor of its naturalness and @xmath46 in accordance with @xmath47 @xmath10 @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] . considering the parity and decay channels predicted in previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , the fully accounted amplitude will comprise the scalar meson @xmath51 , tensor meson @xmath52 , and axial mesons @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath3 exchanges in the @xmath27-channel . for simplicity and clarity , we consider the model of @xmath26 exchanges , although the remainder have minor roles with contributions at an order of @xmath55 at most according to the coupling constants predicted in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as well as based on the analysis of the regge - pole fit to the data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> then , in order to obtain a fair description of existing data up to @xmath56 10 gev , it is natural to employ @xmath57-parity counting to determine the phases of the degenerate trajectories @xmath0-@xmath58 and @xmath3-@xmath59 in a similar manner to pion photoproduction @xcite . to identify the sign of the photon - meson coupling , </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define the @xmath57-parity for a photon in the case where the isoscalar part of the photon is @xmath57-parity negative and the isovector part is @xmath57-parity positive @xcite . in the diagrams of the @xmath27-channel exchanges shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the @xmath57-parity negative @xmath3 and @xmath57-parity positive @xmath0 couple with the isoscalar photon , which does not change sign in the @xmath60 vertex , whereas the @xmath57-parity positive @xmath59 and @xmath0 couple to the isovector photon , which changes sign in the @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the signs of the exchange - degenerate ( exd ) mesons in the production amplitudes can be written as @xmath62 where the respective phases are determined according to the addition of each canonical phase , @xmath63 . the @xmath0 exchange with signs denoting the @xmath0-meson charge </S>",

    "<S> ( [ rho+ ] ) and ( [ rho- ] ) in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> in numerical calculations , either the complex or constant phase for the @xmath0 exchange will reproduce a slow decrease in the cross section according to the energy - dependence , @xmath66 which contradicts the rapid slope in the decrease observed in both cross sections . furthermore , the @xmath26 exchanges with the exd phases in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ regge - amp ] ) are largely overestimated for both cross sections , unless the intercept of the @xmath0 trajectory is smaller than usual , e.g. , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to obtain agreement with the experiments , we must use the cutoff function with the trajectory @xmath68 , as conventionally adopted by laget @xcite , or we assume a violation of the exd in one of these @xmath0-@xmath58 and @xmath3-@xmath59 pairs , as employed by clark and donnachie @xcite . to favor the dominance of @xmath3 exchange with the exd phase over @xmath0 </S>",
