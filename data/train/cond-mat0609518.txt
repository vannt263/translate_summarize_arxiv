    "since the pioneering work by flory @xcite self- and mutually avoiding walks on lattices have been used extensively to model linear polymer molecules . the realization that the graphs relevant in the high - temperature series expansion of the n - vector model of magnetism correspond to self - avoiding walks in the limit @xmath0 @xcite made it possible to apply the ideas of the renormalization group to polymer systems , and the concept of scaling has been very important in the later development of this field @xcite .    if the polymer chains are placed in a solvent , as the temperature is lowered the chains may change from an extended to a collapsed configuration .",
    "the temperature where this transition happens was named the @xmath1 temperature @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was modelled by self - avoiding walks with an attractive interaction between monomers on first neighbor sites of the lattice ( interacting saw s - isaw ) , and if this problem is considered in an ensemble which is grand - canonical with respect to the number of monomers the @xmath1-point of polymer collapse was found to be a tricritical point @xcite . thus , in these generalized parameter space , the transition between a non - polymerized and a polymerized phase is continuous at high temperatures , but becomes of first order as the temperature is lowered , and a tricritical point separates these two transition lines .",
    "the polymer - solvent system may also be treated in more detail , using a lattice gas model with two different particles ( polymer monomers and solvent molecules ) @xcite , and such models describe quite well experimental results of equilibrium polymerization in solution @xcite .",
    "actually the simpler isaw model may be obtained as a limiting case of the more general diluted polymer model @xcite , and the tricritical points in the two models apparently belong to the same universality class . in two dimensions ,",
    "extensive numerical work has been done to calculate the tricritical exponents of the isaw model @xcite , and for the diluted polymer model the tricritical exponents were calculated exactly @xcite .",
    "also , it was found that in some cases the isaw model may display a third phase , besides the non - polymerized and the polymerized phases , which is a dense phase .",
    "this behavior seems to be restricted to two - dimensional lattices , and was found on the husimi lattice @xcite as well as on the square lattice , using transfer matrix and finite size scaling techniques @xcite . from these studies one may conclude that even qualitative aspects of the thermodynamic behavior of interacting polymers may be determined by details of the model . on the square and the @xmath2 husimi lattice , for example , a dense phase exists if the interaction is assumed to be between first - neighbor bonds , but is not stable if interacting monomers are considered .",
    "including interactions between saw s is a major complication of the model , both in closed form approximations and in transfer matrix calculations . in a recent paper @xcite , krawczyk et .",
    "al . proposed and alternative approach which seems to be very promising , since only one - site interactions are present . in this model",
    ", @xmath3 monomers may be placed on site @xmath4 of the lattice , and each site contributes with a factor @xmath5 to the statistical weight of a configuration . without loss of generalization , we may fix the weight of an empty site to be equal to one .",
    "this model is inspired on a generalization of a model of weighted random walks proposed by domb and joyce some time ago @xcite and a it was also discussed in @xcite for the particular choice @xmath6 of the weight functions .",
    "the model was studied in @xcite using simulations for the particular case @xmath7 and as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , fixing @xmath10 . with a fixed value for @xmath11 only polymerized phases",
    "will appear , and the authors look for transitions between those phases . for the particular case of a model where immediate self - reversals are forbidden ,",
    "simulations on a cubic lattice ( model rf3 ) show a transition between extended and collapsed phases .",
    "as the parameters are changed , there are indications in the simulations that the transition changes from second to first order . in another case ( ra2-immediate reversals allowed , simulations on the square lattice ) , no evidence of a phase transition is found .    in this paper , we solve the model proposed in @xcite on a bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath12 .",
    "although the critical exponents are classical for bethe lattice solutions , they may provide better information on the thermodynamic behavior of models than simpler mean - field approximations , particularly for polymer models , since first neighbor correlations are included @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our calculation to the case @xmath13 , where collapse may already occur , but we will not assume @xmath10 , so that transitions between polymerized and non - polymerized phases may be found .",
    "similar to what happens in the studies of the isaw model and in the simulations of the model with multiple monomers per site @xcite , qualitative differences are found on the bethe lattice solutions of the ra and rf models . in the more restrictive rf model ,",
    "we find two distinct polymerized phases , one of them with double occupied sites only .",
    "this phase does not appear in the ra model .",
    "for @xmath14 , no qualitative differences in the phase diagrams are found as @xmath12 is changed .",
    "although a tricritical point is found in the rf model , as expected , in the ra model the transition between the non - polymerized and the polymerized phases is always discontinuous for non vanishing values of @xmath8 .    in section [ defmod ] the model",
    "is defined in greater detail and its solution on the bethe lattice in terms of recursion relations is presented .",

    "the polymeric chains are linear self- and mutually - avoiding walks , each step linking two monomers located on first - neighbor sites",
    ". thus multiple steps of the walk may be placed on the same bond of the lattice .",
    "the chains are not allowed to form rings .",
    "the statistical weight of a configuration will be a product over site configuration weights @xmath5 , where @xmath4 labels the site and @xmath3 is the number of monomers located on site @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the weight of an empty site to be unitary ( @xmath16 ) and the weights to be independent of the site ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the model may be interpreted as an interacting polymer model , so that @xmath18 is the fugacity of a monomer and @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the interaction energy of the set of @xmath21 monomers located on the same site .",
    "monomers on different sites do not interact .",
    "usually , if we are interested in the collapse transition , the monomer - monomer interactions should be attractive , and thus @xmath22 . for @xmath23 the usual polymerization model in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "is recovered , which has been much studied as a model for equilibrium polymerization @xcite .",
    "the model described here is the same studied by krawczyk et al @xcite , with a slight generalization , since they fixed @xmath24 in their simulations . with the parametrization adopted by them , the polymerization transition between a non - polymerized and a polymerized phase is not found .",
    "following krawczyk et al @xcite , we consider two versions of the model . in the ra ( reversion allowed ) variant ,",
    "all walks which obey the self - avoidance restraint are included , whereas in the rf ( reversal forbidden ) variant , only walks without immediate self - reversals are allowed . in other words , in the rf case configurations such that the walk reaches a site and immediately leaves this site through the same bond are prohibited .",
    "we will here discuss the solution of the model for the particular case @xmath13 on the bethe lattice .",
    "this is the smallest value for @xmath15 for which the collapse may be found , so we have chosen it for simplicity .",
    "the bethe lattice is the core of a cayley tree , and the exact solution of statistical models on it may be viewed as an approximation of the solutions of the same models on regular lattices with the same coordination number @xcite .",
    "we consider a cayley tree of coordination number @xmath12 and place the endpoints of the walks on the surface of the tree . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] a configuration which contributes to the partition function of the ra model is shown for a tree with @xmath2 and three generations .",

    "this configuration is allowed in the ra model , but not in the rf model .",
    "polymer bonds ( steps of the walks ) are represented by full lines , while the lattice bonds are dashed lines.,height=226 ]    the solution of the model on the bethe lattice is obtained by defining partial partition functions on rooted sub - trees , and realizing that a subtree with @xmath26 generations may be obtained through the connection of @xmath27 @xmath21-generations subtrees to a new site and bond @xcite .",
    "this operation leads to recursion relations for the partial partition functions .",

    "any expected value in the center of the tree may be expressed as a function of these ratios , so that if we are interested in the behavior of the model in the center of the tree and in the thermodynamic limit , we should find the fixed point of the recursion relations for the ratios , which are :    @xmath40 \\,\\frac{r_1}{d } ,    \\\\ [ 4ex ] % \\mbox { }   \\nonumber\\\\ r'_2 \\,&= & \\,2 \\,\\left[\\binom{q-1}{2 } \\,r_1 ^ 2 \\,+\\ ,   ( q-1 ) \\ , r_2 \\,\\right]\\,\\frac{\\omega_2}{d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ rrrf ]    where @xmath41    for the ra model , where immediate self - reversals are allowed , three other root configurations for subtrees are possible .",

    "the recursion relations for this generalized model are :    @xmath45    notice that , although the first five terms are similar to the ones in the rf model , the multiplicities related to the connections of the two additional monomers may be larger in the less restrictive ra model .",

    "<S> we solve a model of self - avoiding walks with up to two monomers per site on the bethe lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this model , inspired in the domb - joyce model , was recently proposed to describe the collapse transition observed in interacting polymers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when immediate self - reversals are allowed ( ra model ) , the solution displays a phase diagram with a polymerized phase and a non - polymerized phase , separated by a phase transition which is of first order for a non - vanishing statistical weight of doubly occupied sites . </S>",
    "<S> if the configurations are restricted forbidding immediate self - reversals ( rf model ) , a richer phase diagram with two distinct polymerized phases is found , displaying a tricritical point and a critical endpoint . </S>"
