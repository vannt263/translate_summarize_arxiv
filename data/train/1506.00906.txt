    "when disordered materials are quenched to low temperatures , the dynamics can become non - ergodic and the system may fall out of equilibrium  @xcite . understanding this phenomenon , known as the glass transition , is one of the open questions in current statistical mechanics .",
    "while a complete theory which satisfactorily explains all features of glass forming materials is missing , spin models have been proposed to understand particular aspects of the glass problem . for example , static properties of glasses are captured by ising models with random interactions , the so - called spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "these models have recently gained renewed interest in the context of both quantum adiabatic optimization  @xcite and , in presence of external random fields , of the many - body localization phase transition  @xcite .",
    "spin models which study dynamical properties of glasses are so - called kinetically constrained models  @xcite ( kcms ) . in these kcms , separation of relaxation timescales as well as space - time dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite result from transitions ( spin flips ) which are allowed or forbidden depending on the state of neighboring spins .",

    "tuning the driving strength @xmath3 of the @xmath4 transition , allows one to study the crossover from classical to quantum dynamics of rydberg excitations . for large @xmath3 ,",
    "the relaxation of rydberg excitations resembles the one of defects in a classical kcm , the one - spin facilitated model  @xcite ( 1-sfm ) . here , kinetic constraints are a consequence of the interplay between strong interactions of rydberg - excited atoms  @xcite and the laser detuning from @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , for vanishing @xmath3 , coherences of the @xmath5 transition dominate the dynamics within the lifetime of the rydberg states  @xcite . in the case of large laser detuning from the rydberg state",
