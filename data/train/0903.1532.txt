    "dynamical systems @xmath2 associated to a function @xmath3\\rightarrow [ a , b]$ ] with @xmath4 on a real interval are very well - known .",
    "their periodic orbits , if any , @xmath5 are an important feature .",
    "there is a growing interest in numerical analysis and industrial mathematics to study such systems , or systems in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "very often , dynamical systems in several dimensions are obtained coupling one - dimensional ones and their properties are strongly linked .",
    "simple dynamical systems often involve periodic motion .",
    "quasi - periodic or chaotic motion is frequently present in more complicated dynamical systems .",
    "the most famous theorem in this field of research is the sharkovskii s theorem , which addresses the existence of periodic orbits of continuous maps of the real line into itself .",
    "this theorem was once proved toward the year 1962 and published only two years after , a.n .",
    "sharkovskii @xcite .",
    "mathematical results concerning periodic orbits are often obtained using sets of real numbers . however , most of the time , as the complex behaviour of chaotic dynamical systems is not explicitly tractable , mathematicians have recourse to computer simulations .",
    "the main question which arises then is : does these numerical computations are reliable ?    as an example o.e .",
    "lanford iii @xcite reports the results of some computer experiments on the orbit structure of the discrete maps on a finite set which arise when an expanding map of the circle is iterated `` naively '' on the computer . due to the discrete nature of floating points used by computers ,",
    "there is a huge gap between these results and the theoretical results obtained when this map is considered on a real interval .",
    "( this gap can be narrowed in some sense ( i.e. avoiding the collapse of periodic orbits ) in higher dimensions when ultra weak coupling is used @xcite . )",
    "nowadays the claim is to understand precisely which periodic orbit can be observed numerically in such systems . in a first attempt we study in this paper the orbits generated by the iterations of a one - dimensional system on a finite set @xmath6 with a cardinal @xmath7 .",
    "the final goal of a good understanding of the actual behaviour of dynamical systems acting on floating numbers ( i.e. the numbers used by computers ) will be only reached when this first step will be achieved .    on finite",
    "set , only periodic orbits can exist . for a given function we can compute all the orbits , all together they form a global orbit pattern .",
    "we formalise such a gop as the ordered set of periods when the initial value thumbs the finite set in the increasing order .",
    "we are able to predict , using closed formulas , the number of gop for the set @xmath0 of all the functions on @xmath1 .",
    "we also explore by computer experiments special subsets of @xmath0 in which interesting patterns of gop are found .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ] we display some examples already known of such computational discrepancies for the logistic and circle maps . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we introduce a new mathematical tool : the global orbit pattern , in order to describe more precisely the behaviour of dynamical systems on finite sets . in section section4 we give some closed formulas giving the cardinal of classes of gop of @xmath0 . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we study the case of sets of functions with local properties versus their gop , in order to show the significance of these new tools .",
    "as an example of such collapsing effects , o.e .",
    "lanford iii , presents the results of a sampling study in double precision of a discretization of the logistic map @xmath8    which has excellent ergodic properties .",
    "the precise discretization studied is obtained by first exploiting evenness to fold the interval @xmath9 $ ] to @xmath10 $ ] , i.e replacing ( [ eq0 ] ) by    @xmath11    on @xmath12 $ ] it is not difficult to see that the folded map has the same periods as the original one .",
    "the working interval is then shifted from @xmath13 $ ] to @xmath14 $ ] by translation , in order to avoid perturbation in numerical experiment , by the special value 0 . then the translated folded map is programmed in straightforward way .",
    "out of 1,000 randomly chosen initial points ,    * 890 , i.e. , the overwhelming majority , converged to the fixed point corresponding to the fixed point-1 in the original representation ( [ eq0 ] ) , * 108 converged to a cycle of period 3,490,273 , * the remaining 2 converged to a cycle of period 1,107,319 .",
    "thus , in this case at least , the very long - term behaviour of numerical orbits is , for a substantial fraction of initial points , in flagrant disagreement with the true behaviour of typical orbits of the original smooth logistic map .      in the same paper , o.e .",
    "lanford iii , studies very carefully the numerical approximation of the map    @xmath15    it is perhaps better to think this map ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) as acting on the unit interval with endpoints identified , i.e. , on the circle .",
    "note that @xmath16 everywhere , so @xmath17 is strictly expanding in a particularly clean and simple sense . as a consequence of expansivity",
    ", this mapping has about the best imaginable ergodic properties :    * it admits a unique invariant measure @xmath18 equivalent to lebesgue measure , * the abstract dynamical system @xmath19 is ergodic and in fact isomorphic to a bernoulli shift , * a central limit theorem holds .",
    "( mod 1),width=226 ]    one consequence of ergodicity of @xmath17 relative to @xmath18 is that , for lebesgue almost initial points @xmath20 in the unit interval , the corresponding orbit @xmath21 is asymptotically distributed over the unit interval according to @xmath18 .    in numerical experiments performed by the author , the computer working with fixed finite precision is able to represent finitely many points in the interval in question .",
    "it is probably good , for purposes of orientation , to think of the case where the representable points are uniformly spaced in the interval .",
    "the true smooth map is then _ approximated _ by a discretized map , sending the finite set of representable points in the interval to itself .    describing the discretized",
    "mapping exactly is usually complicated , but it is _ roughly _ the mapping obtained by applying the exact smooth mapping to each of the discrete representable points and `` rounding '' the result to the nearest representable point .",
    "lanford iii has done two kinds of experiments , in the first one he uses double precision floating points , in the second uniformly spaced points in the interval with several order of discretization ( ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) are involved . in each experiment",
    "the questions addressed are :    * how many periodic cycles are there and what are their periods ? * how large are their respective basins of attraction , i.e. , for each periodic cycle , how many initial points give orbits with eventually land on the cycle in question ?",

    "it seems that the computation of numerical approximations of the periodic orbits leads to unpredictable results .",
    "many more examples could be given , but those given may serve to illustrate the intriguing character of the results : the outcomes prove to be extremely sensitive to the details of the experiment , but the results all have a similar flavour : a relatively small number of cycles attracts near all orbits , and the lengths of these significant cycles are much larger than one but much smaller than the number of representable points .",
