    "coupled einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) equations have been studied in various contexts , @xcite . bartnik and mckinnon found particle - like non - abelian solutions of the coupled eym theory , @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the eym system with a scalar field leads to several theories .",
    "we mention gravitating skyrmions , @xcite , black hole solutions in dilaton , @xcite , and massive dilaton and axion gravity , @xcite , and other field configurations in the eym - higgs theory with a higgs doublet , @xcite or with a higgs triplet , @xcite .",
    "non - topological solitons appeared initially as an attempt to explain the structure of hadrons with various  bag \" models , or independently , as mathematical objects , @xcite .",
    "there are two main kinds of non - topological solitons and soliton - stars , q - solitons ( q - balls and q - stars ) and  large \" non - topological solitons .",
    " large \" non - topological solitons are characterized by a potential of the form @xmath0 . inside the soliton or the soliton - star , @xmath1 , @xcite and the kinetic terms arising from the temporal variation of the scalar field dominate . in q - balls",
    "the total energy is minimized at the minimum of the @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "their relativistic generalizations , may consist of one or two scalar fields , @xcite , in a lagrangian with a global @xmath3 symmetry , or of a non - abelian scalar field in the adjoint representation of @xmath4 , @xcite , or with a scalar and a fermion field , @xcite in asymptotically flat or anti de sitter spacetime , @xcite .",
    "q - solitons with local symmetries have also been investigated .",
    "there are charged q - balls , @xcite , and charged q - stars , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to find numerical solutions of the eym equations in the presence of a higgs doublet in the fundamental representation of @xmath5 , reducing the eym - higgs equations to a field configuration corresponding to a ( charged ) q - star . in the absence of the gauge field ,",
    "the equations of motion give rise to a gravitating non - topological soliton , when using a special potential for which @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the free particles and imposing an harmonic time - dependence on the scalar field with the frequency equal to @xmath8 .",
    "our gravitating soliton is _ non - topological _ in the sense that @xmath9 for @xmath10 according to @xcite .",
    "it is a _ q - type _ non - topological soliton in the sense that in the absence of both gravitational and gauge fields one can find by simple calculations that this spherically symmetric higgs field rotates within its symmetry space with a frequency @xmath8 equal to the minimum of the @xmath2 quantity .",
    "the difference between this soliton and the usual non - abelian q - balls is that the symmetry space in the case of non - abelian q - balls is the entire @xmath4 space but in our case is an abelian @xmath3 subgroup of the @xmath5 , though both field configurations are non - abelian , and that non - abelian q - balls consist of fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath4 , when our higgs are in the fundamental representation .",
    "we also study the solutions of the above soliton when the spacetime is asymptotically anti de sitter . in any case",
    ", we find an analytical solution for the scalar field within the soliton , using the approximation known by the study of q - stars .",

    "the higgs field forms a soliton , which when coupled to gravity is a soliton star .",

    "there is also another condition for the existence of q - solitons : the total energy energy should be less than the energy of the free particles with the same charge .",
    "this condition can be handled only numerically : we solve the coupled system of eqs .",
    "[ 18]-[20 ] and include the solution in our figures only when the soliton is stable with respect to fission into free particles .",

    "the eym - higgs equations reduced to an easy - manageable system of equations , corresponding to ( charged ) soliton - stars , by choosing a special potential for the higgs field and imposing a certain time - dependence to it .",
    "the independent parameters are the coupling constant @xmath18 , which represents the  strength \" of the gauge field , the @xmath86 eigenvalue , straightforward connected to the surface gravity through eq . [ 16 ] and equal to the eigen - frequency of the soliton star in the absence of gauge fields , and the cosmological constant .",
    "all the matter and metric field configurations correspond to _ stars _ and not to black holes ( i.e. : no horizon and no anomalies at the center are formed ) , they are time - independent and stable with respect to gravitational collapse .",
    "all the field configurations discussed in the above section are stable with respect to decay into free particles , because their asymptotically anti de sitter mass is smaller than the energy of the free particles .",
    "when the energy of the free fields with the same particle number , equal to @xmath113 with @xmath7 unity for the sake of convenience , tends to become larger than the soliton energy , we interrupt calculations .",
    "the field configuration in the absence of gravitational and gauge fields corresponds to a soliton with @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 as one can find by some simple algebra , i.e. : corresponds to a q - ball type soliton . in the absence of gauge fields , but in the presence of gravity the field configuration corresponds to a soliton star with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath117 which corresponds to a q - type soliton star .",
    "the numbers within the figures [ figure1]-[figure5 ] denote the value of @xmath86 , which plays the same role as the frequency in solitons with global symmetries and the numbers within the figure [ figure6 ] denote @xmath93 .",
    "all the field configurations depicted in our figures are stable with respect to fission into free particles .    the total mass increases with the increase of the coupling constant due to the electrostatic - type terms arising in the @xmath101 component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the value of @xmath121 at the center of the soliton decreases due to the electrostatic repulsion between the different parts of the soliton .",
    "the influence of the cosmological constant to the energy , particle number and radius of the soliton is clear .",
    "the values of the above parameters are in general larger in an anti de sitter spacetime .",
