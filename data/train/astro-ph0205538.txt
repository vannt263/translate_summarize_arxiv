    "miller ( 1964 ) first noted the remarkable sensitivity of the gravitational @xmath0-body problem to small changes in the initial conditions .",
    "errors or perturbations in the coordinates or velocities of one or more stars grow roughly exponentially , with an @xmath3-folding time that is of order the crossing time .",
    "the implication , verified in a number of subsequent studies @xcite , is that @xmath0-body integrations are not reproducible over time scales that exceed a few crossing times .",
    "the instability is somewhat reduced when the newtonian force law is modified by a cutoff @xcite , indicating that it is driven by close encounters .    of interest",
    "is the behavior of miller s instability in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the @xmath0-body equations of motion go over to the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this would imply , for instance , that a particle trajectory which is integrable in a smooth potential should exhibit increasingly regular behavior as the number of point masses used to represent the smooth potential increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if the rate of growth of small perturbations remains substantial even for large @xmath0 , there would be an important sense in which the cbe does not correctly describe the behavior of @xmath0-body systems .",
    "in fact there are indications that the growth rate of miller s instability remains constant or even increases with @xmath0 @xcite , although this result is uncertain since published numerical experiments have been limited to @xmath7 . here",
    "we describe the application of a new , `` systolic '' @xmath0-body algorithm to this problem , which allows us to treat systems with @xmath0 as large as @xmath8 .",
    "we observe for the first time a clear @xmath0-dependence of the instability : the growth rate is found to increase approximately as @xmath9 .",
    "our methods and results are described in  2 and  3 , and the implications for galactic dynamics are discussed in  4 .",
    "following miller ( 1971 ) , we integrated the coupled @xmath0-body and variational equations :    @xmath10    here @xmath11 are the configuration - space coordinates of the @xmath12th particle and @xmath13 are the components of its variational vector .",
    "the masses @xmath14 are assumed equal .",
    "the variational equations represent the time development of the infinitesimal distance between two neighboring @xmath0-body systems .    equations ( [ eq_1a ] ) and ( [ eq_1b ] ) were integrated using the systolic @xmath0-body algorithm described by dorband , hemsendorf & merritt ( 2002 ) .",
    "this algorithm implements the fourth - order hermite integration as described by makino & aarseth ( 1992 ) .",
    "we adopted their formula for computing the time step of particle @xmath12 , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the acceleration @xmath17 , superscripts denote the order of the time derivative , @xmath18 is the system time , and @xmath19 is a dimensionless constant ; we set @xmath20 .",
    "the same time step was used to integrate both the @xmath0-body and variational equations .",
    "the systolic algorithm distributes the particles equally among @xmath21 processors and computes forces by systematically shifting the particle coordinates between processors in a ring .",
    "a single processor was used for small particle numbers while 64 processors were used for the largest-@xmath0 integrations ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the multi - processor integrations were carried out using the cray t3e at the hchstleistungsrechenzentrum in stuttgart .",
    "initial conditions were generated randomly from the isotropic plummer model , whose density and potential satisfy @xmath22 we adopted standard @xmath0-body units @xcite such that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , giving a scale factor @xmath25 .",
    "we defined the crossing time @xmath26 as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; in these units , @xmath30 .",
    "the variational vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 were assigned an initial amplitude of @xmath33 for each particle with randomly chosen directions .    the parameters of the integrations are listed in table 1 .",
    "each integration was continued until a time of 20 , or roughly @xmath34 crossing times , with the exception of the largest run , @xmath35 which was terminated at @xmath36 .",
    "this time is short enough that two - body relaxation should not be important except perhaps for the smallest @xmath0 , and long enough to show a clearly exponential growth of the solutions of the variational equations .",
    "we focussed on the amplitudes of the cartesian components of the variational vectors , @xmath37 , since the variational velocities tend to exhibit spikes in their time dependence @xcite .",
    "we examined three choices for the amplitude @xmath38 of the separation :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath39 , the maximum over @xmath12 of the @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 , the arithmetic mean of the @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath42 , the geometric mean of the @xmath40 .",
    "the instability growth rate @xmath43 was defined as @xmath44 except in the case of small @xmath0 , @xmath45 , growth in the variation was found to be nearly exponential and hence the computed values of @xmath43 depended only weakly on @xmath46 and @xmath18 .",
    "we chose @xmath47 and @xmath48 , except for the @xmath35 run for which @xmath49 .",
    "the three amplitudes @xmath38 defined above were found to be very similar in most of the integrations , as shown in figure 1 for the 10 integrations with @xmath50 . in what follows",
    "we adopt @xmath51 , the geometric mean .",
    "figure 2a shows @xmath52 for each of the integrations .",
    "the mean value of the @xmath3-folding time and its uncertainty are plotted in figure 2b ; the latter was defined as the standard error of the mean , or @xmath53 times the standard deviation , with @xmath54 the number of distinct @xmath0-body integrations .",
    "for the first time , a clear @xmath0-dependence can be seen , in the sense that the average value of @xmath55 declines with increasing @xmath0 : large-@xmath0 systems are more unstable than small-@xmath0 systems .",
    "a number of predictions have been made for the large-@xmath0 dependence of the @xmath3-folding time .",
    "gurzadyan & savvidy ( 1986 ) estimated @xmath56 based on a geometrical approach .",
    "this @xmath0 dependence is clearly inconsistent with figure 2 .",
    "gurzadyan & savvidy s approach was criticized already by heggie ( 1991 ) and goodman , heggie & hut ( 1993 ) due to its improper treatment of close encounters .",
    "the latter authors argued that @xmath57 or @xmath58 ; the weaker dependence would hold only after a time long enough that the perturbation from one star was able to propagate through the system .",
    "we tested these predictions against the @xmath0-body data .",
    "figure 3 shows fits of two functional forms to the mean growth rates :    @xmath59    since any such relation is expected to be valid only in the limit of large @xmath0 , we restricted the fits to @xmath60 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "we used a standard least - squares routine that accounts for errors in the dependent variable ( @xmath43 ) ; in the case of the data pointa with @xmath61 and 131072 , for which there was only one integration , the uncertainty in @xmath43 was assumed to be the same as in the integration with @xmath50 .",
    "these two data points were omitted when computing the values of @xmath62 given in table 2 .",
    "while @xmath63 dependence can clearly be ruled out , we can not distinguish between a @xmath9 and a @xmath64 dependence .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath26 , the best - fit relations are    @xmath65    distinguishing between these two functional forms , or other similar ones , would clearly be very difficult ; even for @xmath66 , the two relations predict values of @xmath55 that differ only by @xmath67 .",
    "our results confirm that the gravitational @xmath0-body problem is inherently chaotic and furthermore that the degree of chaos , as measured by the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories , increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we have directly established a characteristic @xmath3-folding time of @xmath68 for systems with @xmath69 ; if the weak @xmath0-dependence found here can be extrapolated , the characteristic time for systems containing @xmath70 particles would be only slightly smaller , @xmath71 .",
    "hence trajectories in stellar and galactic systems diverge on a time scale that is generically much shorter than the crossing time .",
    "if the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) is a valid representation of large-@xmath0 stellar systems , it should be possible to show that the @xmath0-body trajectories go over , in the limit of large @xmath0 , to the orbits in the corresponding smoothed - out potential .",
    "the generic instability of the @xmath0-body problem precludes this , since the characteristics of the cbe can not be identified with the @xmath0-body orbits for times longer than @xmath72 . at the same time , much experience with @xmath0-body integrations demonstrates that in many ways the behavior of large-@xmath0 systems matches expectations derived from the cbe ( e.g. aarseth & lecar 1975 ) .",
    "a likely resolution of this seeming paradox is that the macroscopic , or finite - amplitude , behavior of trajectories is not well predicted by the rate of growth of small perturbations .",
    "for instance , orbits integrated in `` frozen '' @xmath0-body potentials behave more and more like their smooth - potential counterparts as @xmath0 is increased , even though their liapunov exponents remain large @xcite .",
    "the initial growth of perturbations is exponential but it saturates , at an amplitude that varies inversely with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus the cbe may be a good predictor of the macroscopic dynamics of large-@xmath0 systems even if it does not reproduce the small - scale chaos inherently associated with @xmath0-body dynamics .",
