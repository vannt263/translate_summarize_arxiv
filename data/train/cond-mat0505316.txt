    "the experimental realization  @xcite of bose - einstein condensation in confined gases of atoms at low temperatures has been the stimulus for a wide range of experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . ) by ingenious experimental techniques it is possible to prepare the atoms as either bosons or fermions .",
    "there have now been a number of experiments on trapped gases of fermions , as well as mixtures of bosons and fermions  @xcite .    for a gas of fermions , it is a good approximation to model the system as a collection of non - interacting particles obeying fermi - dirac statistics confined by a simple harmonic oscillator potential . unlike the case of bosons ,",
    "the dominant @xmath0-wave scattering channel is suppressed making the effects of interactions less important  @xcite . with this simple theoretical model for the system ,",
    "it is easy to obtain exact and simple expressions for the single - particle energy levels using the standard quantum mechanical result for the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "this can serve as a starting point for a theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic behaviour of the system .",
    "because the energy levels for a set of particles ( bosons or fermions ) confined by a simple harmonic oscillator potential form a discrete set , in order to calculate the thermodynamic properties we must be able to perform sums over the quantum numbers labelling the states ; this can lead to difficulties in evaluation . by restricting the parameters of the system ( temperature and oscillator frequencies for example ) it may be possible to argue that the sums can be approximated with integrals , an approximation that renders the computation of analytical results easier .",
    "we will refer to the approximation of sums with integrals as the continuum approximation , since it is equivalent to regarding the discrete energy spectrum as continuous .",
    "this approximation was first applied to the fermi gas in the now classic paper of butts and rokhsar  @xcite .",
    "even when one goes beyond this approximation , as we will show below , the continuum approximation can still be very accurate in some temperature regimes , and can capture the leading order behaviour if the temperature is not too low .    the first study that showed there might be more features present beyond what is obtained by the continuum approximation was given by schneider and wallis  @xcite .",
    "these authors computed the thermodynamic expressions numerically , and their results showed that there were a number of step - like features present , not predicted by the continuum approximation . in particular , the chemical potential , which is a smooth function in the continuum approximation , has a series of step - like jumps when a numerical analysis of the exact result is performed .",
    "this in turn can lead to step - like , or oscillatory , behaviour of other thermodynamic properties , such as the specific heat .",
    "another important consequence of the work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is that at sufficiently low temperatures there are significant deviations in the specific heat from the linear temperature dependence predicted  @xcite by the continuum approximation .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to analyze the situation analytically to obtain the step - like behaviour of the chemical potential , and to apply this method to the evaluation of the specific heat .",
    "in addition to the two studies already mentioned  @xcite , there have been a number of other related theoretical works . ref .",

    "the key observation is that for a simple harmonic oscillator confining potential , the evaluation of the thermodynamic potential is mathematically very similar to that of a gas of charged fermions in a constant magnetic field .",
    "landau  @xcite was the first to show that the thermodynamic properties of electrons in a constant magnetic field undergo oscillations whose period is determined by the inverse of the magnetic field strength .",

    "this latter effect was not found for the isotropic case and it is worth commenting on why this occurs , in contrast with what might be expected from the de  haas - van  alphen effect where the thermodynamics shows a periodicity in the inverse magnetic field strength .",
    "the difference between the two cases is related to the relationship between the chemical potential and the particle number . in both cases (",

    "for the trapped fermi gas in an isotropic potential we found @xmath282 , so that @xmath130 is independent of @xmath207 , although there is a dependence on the particle number .",

    "for the single component gas , we expect that an analysis similar to that given by luttinger  @xcite in the de  haas - van  alphen effect could be used to show that both the amplitude and period of the oscillations are not affected by interactions to leading order .",
