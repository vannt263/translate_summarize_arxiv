    "recently , a number of important progress have been made in the physics of @xmath0 suppression as a signature of quark gluon plasma that inevitably leads us to augment the original work by matsui and satz@xcite with a more detailed study of heavy quark system at finite temperatures , before confronting the recent rhic data@xcite , and in predicting results for lhc . among these theoretical developments",
    "are the phenomenologically successful statistical model for @xmath0 production@xcite , based on a coalescence assumption near @xmath1@xcite , the recombination of charm pairs into @xmath0@xcite , and the recent lattice calculations , showing strong evidence that the heavy quarkonium will persist above @xmath1@xcite .",
    "while these results seem at odd with each other , it only suggests that one still needs a more detailed understanding of the properties of heavy quark system in the quark gluon plasma , especially between the phase transition and the dissolving temperatures , before a consistent picture of quarkonium suppression in heavy ion collision can be achieved .    in this respect ,",
    "an important quantity to investigate is the effective thermal width , and/or the effective dissociation cross section of a heavy quarkonium in the quark gluon plasma . except for its existence , the present lattice results are far from making quantitative statements on the magnitude of thermal width for charmonium states above @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in this work , we will use the perturbative qcd approach to calculate the thermal width .",
    "so far , such calculations have been limited to dissociation processes by gluons to the lowest order ( lo)@xcite , because the elementary @xmath0-parton dissociation cross section was available only to that order@xcite , and to part of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in the quasi free approximation@xcite .",
    "recently , two of us have performed the dissociation cross section calculation to nlo in qcd@xcite . here , we will implement the nlo formula , to calculate the corresponding thermal width of charmonium@xcite , and then perform a similar calculation for the bottonium case .",
    "the nlo calculation of @xmath0-parton dissociation calculations involves collinear divergence .",
    "when applying this elementary cross section to dissociation by hadrons , the collinear divergence is cured by mass factorization , which renormalizes the divergent part of the cross section into the parton distribution function of the hadron .",
    "such complications disappear at finite temperatures , as the thermal masses of the partons automatically renders the divergence finite .",
    "the magnitude of the thermal mass as a function of temperature has been obtained previously by examining the equation of state @xcite . in the region of @xmath1 to 2@xmath1 , they are of the order of 300 - 400 mev for quarks and 400 - 600 mev for gluons . in this work , instead of following the detailed temperature dependence , we shall study results with a thermal mass of 400 and 600 mev for both the quarks and gluons .",
    "as we will see , with an effective thermal mass of 400 mev , we find that the effective thermal dissociation cross section above 1.4 @xmath1 is larger than 250 mev .",
    "the nlo calculation is proportional to the derivative of the momentum space wave function .",
    "we will use the coulomb wave function , whose size have been fitted to reproduce the result obtained by wong@xcite , using a potential extracted from lattice gauge thermodynamical quantities .    in section",
    "ii , we will recapitulate the lo result . in section iii",
    ", we will discuss the nlo for @xmath0 .",
    "the lo and nlo results for bottonium are given in section iv .",
    "the lo invariant matrix element for the @xmath0 dissociation cross section by gluon first obtained by peskin@xcite and rederived by one of us@xcite using the bethe - salpeter equation is given as ,        @xmath3    here , @xmath4 represents the polarization index of the @xmath0 and gluon respectively , and @xmath5 are the four momentum of the gluon , @xmath6 . the quantity @xmath7 is the relative three momentum between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the charmonium wave function .",
    "@xmath11 is the mass of a quarkonium , and @xmath12 is the number of color .",
    "current conservation is easily shown to be satisfied , @xmath13 .",
    "the energy conservation in the non - relativistic limit implies , @xmath14 from which , the counting scheme for both the lo@xcite and the nlo@xcite are given as follows , @xmath15    the effective thermal width and cross section are obtained by folding the matrix element with the thermal parton distribution , @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the parton degeneracy , which is taken to be 16 for the gluon in the lo calculation . here",
    ", we will perform the calculation in the rest frame of @xmath0 , so the relative velocity of @xmath0 and initial parton is @xmath19 .",
    "the cross section is given as ,    @xmath20    .the binding energy , the rms radius , and its corresponding bhor radius of @xmath0 at finite temperature . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we have calculated the thermal widths of @xmath0 and @xmath2 at finite temperature using the elementary parton - quarkonium dissociation cross section at nlo in qcd and assuming thermal partons with effective thermal mass .",
    "we find that for @xmath0 at 1.4 @xmath1 , the thermal width will be 100 to 250 mev , which translates into an effective thermal cross section of several mb .",
    "however , the corrsponding width and effective cross section for the @xmath2 is much smaller .",
    "recently mocsy and petreczky @xcite have also calculated the thermal widths of charmonium and bottonium in qgp , assuming that the quarkonium and its constituents are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding .",
    "the thermal width estimated by mp is similar to ours for the bottonium but several times larger for the charmonium .",
    "the result for the charmonium by mp is obtained using a phenomenological formula obtained when the binding energy is much smaller than the temperature ; hence further work has to be performed to understand the discrepancy .",
