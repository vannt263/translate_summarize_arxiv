    "there has been great interest in transition - metal nitrides in the past several decades @xcite .",
    "this interest is fueled by their many potential , technological applications , including high hardness , @xcite high temperature stability @xcite , mechanical strength @xcite , magnetic @xcite , and electronic properties that vary from semiconducting to metallic phases @xcite .",
    "these unique properties make xn useful refractory materials and hard coatings for cutting tools @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned properties of these materials motivated a variety of experimental @xcite as well as theoretical studies @xcite with the latter utilizing computational techniques of varying sophistication , ranging from the tight binding and the empirical pseudopotential methods to ab - initio density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "even with the vast number of experimental and computational studies already available for xn , a satisfactory description of their electronic , transport ( effective mass ) , elastic , and structural properties is still an area of active research .",
    "experimentally , scn is known to be a semiconductor with a band gap in the range of 0.90 @xmath2 0.1 ev to 1.32 @xmath2 0.3 ev @xcite , while most dft calculations utilizing local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) potentials found it to be a metal @xcite .",
    "recent green s function quasiparticle @xcite , exact exchange @xcite and screened exchange @xcite calculations have reported that scn is a semiconductor with an indirect gap ( e@xmath0 ) in the range 0.54  1.70 ev . for yn , few theoretical calculations utilizing various forms of dft potentials have reported that it is semi - metallic or semiconductor with an indirect band gap ( e@xmath0 ) of 0.2  0.3 ev @xcite , 0.54 ev @xcite , and 0.80 ev @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any experiments reporting the indirect band gap of yn .",
    "theoretical computations have had difficulties in predicting the correct band gap energy and other related electronic properties of xn from first principle .",
    "indeed , the `` band gap problem '' is decades old .",
    "several approaches to solve it have been proposed with significant successes .",
    "density functional theory plus additional couloumb interactions ( dft+u ) formalism @xcite has had good successes in obtaining correct energy bands and gaps of materials , but can only be applied to correlated and localized electrons , e.g. , 3@xmath3 or 4@xmath4 in transition and rare - earth oxides .",
    "hybrid functionals @xcite have also been used in attempts to improve on the calculated energy bands and band gaps of materials .",
    "this approach involves a range separation of the exchange energy into some fraction of nonlocal hartree - fock exchange potential and a fraction of local spin density approximation ( lsda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange potential .",
    "we should note that this range separation is not universal .",
    "there is always a range separation parameter @xmath5 which varies between 0 and @xmath6 . while it is reasonably clear that there exists a value of @xmath5 that gives the correct gap for a given system , this @xmath5 is not universal as its value is always adjusted from one system to another @xcite .",
    "for example , in hse06 @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath7 0.11@xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the bohr radius ) and in perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbeh ) global hybrid @xcite , it is 25 @xmath10 short - range exact exchange and 75 @xmath10 short - range pbe exchange .",
    "even though the hse functional , in most cases , accurately reproduces the optical gap in semiconductors , it severely underestimates the gap in insulators @xcite and the band width in metallic systems is generally too large @xcite , the @xcite ( ev ) gga and the @xcite modified becke - johnson ( tb - mbj ) potentials have also provided some improvements to the calculated band gap of materials . for tb - mbj , while the band gaps are considerably improved , the effective masses are severely underestimated .",
    "@xcite in the case of the ev - gga potential , the equilibrium lattice constants are far too large as compared to experiment and , as such , leads to an unsatisfactory total energy @xcite .",
    "the theoretical underestimations of band gaps and other energy eigenvalues have been ascribed to the inadequacies of density functional potentials for the description of ground state electronic properties of xn @xcite . also , other methods @xcite that entirely go beyond the density functional theory ( dft ) do not obtain the correct band gap values of most semiconductors without adjustment or fitting parameters @xcite .",
    "this unsatisfactory situation is a key motivation for our work . in light of the promising technological properties of these materials ,",
    "parameter - free computations could aid significantly in the design and fabrication of devices . to this end",
    ", we have also investigated the elastic properties of scn and yn within our parameter - free method . in yn , we predict several of these properties for which there are yet no experimental data .    in this paper",
    ", we utilized a simple and robust approach based on basis set optimization .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . after this introduction in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the computational method and details used in our work are given in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows our computed results .",
    "calculated electronic structures are given in subsection  [ subsec : electronic ] .",
    "the results for the chemical bonding and structural properties are presented and discussed in subsections  [ subsec : dos ] and  [ subsec : structural ] .",
    "we will conclude with a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we utilized the electronic structure package developed at ames laboratory of the u.s .",
    "department of energy ( doe ) , ames , iowa @xcite . for the lda computations",
    ", we used the ceperley and alder dft exchange - correlation contribution @xcite as parameterized by vosko - wilk - nusair @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as the ca - vwn potential .",
    "the gga calculations were carried out using the ceperley and alder dft exchange correlation contribution @xcite as parameterized by perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as the ca - pw potential .",
    "we employed the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) approach where an unknown wave function , for the solid state , is expressed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals of the individual atoms in the system .",
    "the radial parts of these orbitals are generally exponential or gaussian functions resulting from self consistent calculations of energy levels of the atomic or ionic species that are present in the solid under study .",
    "we use gaussian functions and refer to that rendition of lcao as the linear combination of gaussian orbitals ( lcgo ) .",
    "in addition to the use of dft potentials and of the lcao formalism , our computational approach rests on the bagayoko , zhao , and williams @xcite method as recently enhanced by the work of ekuma @xcite and franklin @xcite ( bzw - ef ) . the method heeds the statement by kohn and sham @xcite that the equations defining lda have to be solved self - consistently . upon the selection of an exchange correlation potential , these equations reduce to ( 1 ) the one giving the ground state charge density in terms of the wave functions of the occupied states and ( 2 ) the kohn - sham equation .",
    "we describe below the aforementioned method .    in the bzw - ef method",
    ", we begin our calculations with the minimum basis set , the one that is just large enough to account for all the electrons in the system under study ( in this case xn ) .",
    "our self consistent calculation with this basis set is followed by another where the basis set is augmented with one additional orbital from one of the atoms or ions in the system .",
    "the comparison of the occupied energies from calculations i and ii generally shows that they are different , with those from calculation ii generally lower than their corresponding ones from i. a third , self consistent calculation is performed with a basis set that includes that for calculation ii plus another orbital from one of the atoms in the system . this process of augmenting the basis set and of carrying out self consistent calculations continues until a calculation , say n , is found to have the _ same occupied energies _ as calculation ( n + 1 ) that follows it , within computational uncertainty of about 50 mev .",
    "this convergence of the occupied energies identifies the basis set of calculation n as the optimal one .",
    "the optimal basis set is thus the smallest one with which the occupied energies verifiably reach their respective minima @xcite .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions provide the physics description of the system .",
    "the bzw - ef method has been shown to lead to accurate ground state properties of many semiconductors : c - inn @xcite , w - inn @xcite , w - cds @xcite , c - cds @xcite , rutile - tio@xmath11 @xcite , srtio@xmath12 @xcite , alas @xcite ,",
    "gan , si , c , ruo@xmath11 @xcite , batio@xmath12 @xcite , and carbon nanotubes @xcite .    in calculations with basis set larger than the optimal one , the ground state charge density does not change , nor do the hamiltonian and the eigenvalues of the occupied states .",
    "consequently , these calculations do not lower any occupied energies ( as compared to the results obtained with the optimal basis set ) , even though they generally lead to some lower , unoccupied energies @xcite by virtue of the rayleigh theorem @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh theorem can be stated as follows : if one solves an eigenvalue equation with two basis sets i and ii , with set ii larger than i and where i is entirely contained in ii , then the eigenvalues obtained with set ii are lower than or equal to their corresponding ones obtained with basis set i ( i.e. , e@xmath13 @xmath14 e@xmath15 , @xmath16 i @xmath17n ) .",
    "this theorem explains the reasons that some unoccupied energies are lowered when the kohn - sham equation is solved with basis sets larger than the optimal one .",
    "such a lowering of unoccupied energies with basis sets larger than the optimal one is fundamentally different from the one that occurs before the occupied energies reach their minima .",
    "the latter lowering is ascribed to physical interactions given that both the charge density and the hamiltonian change , from one calculation to the next , before one reaches the optimal basis set , while the former one is unphysical .",
    "important points about this method include the fact that it provides the needed variational freedom for the restructuring of the electronic cloud in the material under study , as opposed to the case in isolated atoms or ions .",
    "indeed , the methodical increase of the basis set remedies possible radial , angular symmetry , and size deficiencies by the time the optimal basis set is reached . by changing the basis set , i.e. , the external input to the charge density equation , the method solves self - consistently both this equation and the kohn sham equation in a way that is quintessentially different from input changes limited to new expansion coefficients in the iterative process @xcite .",
    "the latter input changes can not remedy any significant deficiency of the basis set , i.e. , in terms of radial orbital , angular symmetry , or the total number of functions ( the dimension of the hamiltonian ) . in light of the rayleigh theorem",
    ", a deficiency could be over - completeness as well , in single trial basis set calculations . _",
    "the critical importance of the bzw - ef method resides in part in the fact that , by its very variational derivation , the validity and the related physical content of the eigenvalues of the kohn sham equation directly hinge on the final , self - consistent charge density being as close as possible to that of the real material under study . _    the thesis work of williams @xcite showed that the method may not be needed for the description of materials established , experimentally , to be metals .",
    "at least one band crosses the fermi level in a metal and the lowest - laying conduction bands reach their minima at the same time as the valence bands do . consequently , the basis set and variational effect @xcite that explains the lowering of unoccupied energies , while the hamiltonian does not change , does not affect these lowest - laying conduction bands in metals , even though it lowers some other conduction bands .",
    "this fact partly explains the early success of dft for the description of metals as opposed to semiconductors and insulators . in the initial bzw method",
    ", we increased the basis set by adding orbitals in the order of increasing energies in the atomic or ionic species .",
    "recent works by ekuma @xcite and franklin @xcite led us to the realization that , for the valence states , polarization ( i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 orbitals ) have primacy over spherical symmetry ( @xmath19 orbital ) in diatomic molecules and more complex systems with three or more atomic or ionic sites .",
    "hence , while still useful , adding orbitals in the order of increasing energies in atomic or ionic species can be relaxed .      in the ground state , both scn and yn have the rock - salt crystal structure .",
    "we utilized room temperature experimental lattice constant of 4.501  @xcite and 4.837  @xcite for scn and yn , respectively . each sc ( or y )",
    "atom is surrounded by six n atoms , thereby providing the octahedral environment at the sc ( or y ) site , which leads to the splitting of the degenerate @xmath3 orbital into t@xmath20 and e@xmath21 states .",
    "every sc ( or y ) atom has 12 nearest neighbors sc ( or y ) atoms and 6 next nearest neighbors sc ( or y ) atoms .",
    "preliminary calculations indicated that scandium and yttrium are closer to sc@xmath22and y@xmath22 than to the neutral sc and y , respectively .",
    "similarly , nitrogen is n@xmath23 as opposed to the neutral n. therefore , we first carried out self consistent calculations of the electronic properties of x@xmath22 ( x = sc , y ) and n@xmath23 . atomic orbitals utilized in these calculations , for the valence states , are given between parentheses : sc@xmath22 ( 3@xmath193@xmath183@xmath34@xmath194@xmath184@xmath3 ) and n@xmath23 ( 2@xmath192@xmath183@xmath193@xmath18 ) for scn and y@xmath22 ( 4@xmath194@xmath184@xmath35@xmath195@xmath18 ) and n@xmath23 ( 2@xmath192@xmath183@xmath193@xmath18 ) for yn .",
    "other atomic states with higher binding energies were treated as deep core states . in the optimal basis set for the valence states of scn , ( 4@xmath184@xmath3 ) and ( 3@xmath18 ) are unoccupied for sc@xmath22 and n@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "for yn , the unoccupied orbitals in the optimal basis set for the valence states are ( @xmath24 ) and ( 3@xmath18 ) for y@xmath22 and n@xmath23 , respectively . nevertheless , these orbitals are included in the self - consistent lcao calculations to allow for a reorganization of electronic cloud in the solid environment , including polarization .    in the self - consistency calculation , both the potential and charge density",
    "are also expanded in terms of even tempered gaussian orbitals ( sc : 15 , 15 , and 13 ; y : 15 , 15 , and 13 ; n : 17 , 17 , and 15 for @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and @xmath3 orbitals , respectively ) .",
    "the exponents , @xmath25 , of the gaussian basis sets range from 0.19 to @xmath26 .",
    "the charge fitting error using the gaussian functions in the atomic calculation was about @xmath27 . since the deep core states are fully occupied and are inactive chemically in the materials , the charge densities of the deep core states",
    "are kept the same as in the free atoms . however , the core states of low binding energy are still allowed to fully relax , along with the valence states , in the self consistent calculations . the computational error for",
    "the valence charge was 1.2 @xmath28 @xmath27 and 5.9 @xmath28 @xmath29 per valence electron for scn and yn , respectively .",
    "the self consistent potential converged to a difference of @xmath27 after about 60 iterations .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration for the charge density in the self consistent iterations was based on 28 special k points in the irreducible bz ( ibz ) .",
    "the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were then obtained at 161 special k points in the ibz for the band structure .",
    "a total of 152 weighted k points , chosen along the high symmetry lines in the ibz of scn and yn , respectively , were used to solve for the energy eigenvalues from which the electron densities of states ( dos ) were calculated using the linear , analytical tetrahedron method @xcite .",
    "the partial density of states ( pdos ) and the effective charge of each atom were calculated using the mulliken charge analysis procedure @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the equilibrium lattice constant ( a@xmath1 ) , the bulk modulus ( b@xmath1 ) and the electron effective masses for different directions with respect to the @xmath30 point . for the calculation of the equilibrium lattice",
    "constant , we utilized the murnaghan equation of state @xcite . by applying an appropriate set of strains to the undeformed unit cell lattice , we calculated the elastic constants from the resulting change in total energy on the deformation using the strain - energy method . for a typical cubic crystal ,",
    "three independent elastic moduli are of importance ; they are usually denoted as c@xmath31 , c@xmath32 , and c@xmath33 .",

    "all energies are referred relative to zero energy at the top of the valence band ( vb ) .",
    "the electronic structures of the valence bands , the low energy conduction bands , and the band gap determine the most important properties of these materials in device applications .",
    "our ab - initio method shows that the fundamental gaps of both scn and yn are indirect ones , with the maximum of the valence band ( @xmath34 ) occurring at @xmath30 and the minimum of the conduction band ( @xmath35 ) at the @xmath36 point ( see figs .  [",

    "fig : scn_elec](c ) and  [ fig : yn_elec](c ) for scn and yn , respectively ) .",
    "the upper valence bands originated from the bonding between n@xmath38 states and an admixture of 3@xmath3 states ( for sc ) and 4@xmath3 states ( for y ) .",
