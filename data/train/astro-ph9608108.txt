    "the absolute magnitude of the rr lyrae variables , @xmath9 , is integral to determining distances to old stellar systems in our galaxy and to other nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , rr lyraes are widely used to measure the distances to galactic globular clusters , to the galactic center , and to many members of the local group .",
    "in addition , the distances to individual field rr lyrae stars in the thick disk and halo of our galaxy enable us to determine the kinematic and spatial distributions of these populations .",
    "precise distances to globular clusters are also necessary to determine their ages ( e.g. , buonanno _ et al .",
    "the variation of @xmath9 with abundance , [ fe / h ] , strongly affects the derived age spread and age - metallicity relation of the galactic globular cluster system . these quantities in turn place strong constraints on scenarios describing the formation of the galaxy , specifying the rate of halo formation and whether the chemical enrichment of the halo proceeded in a uniform , global fashion , ( eggen _ et al .",
    "_ 1962 ) or within autonomous star - forming fragments ( searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "the zero - point of the @xmath9[fe / h ] relation sets the mean absolute age of the globular cluster system , thus placing a critical lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "the rr lyraes in a given globular cluster are observed to have a very narrow range of intensity - mean magnitudes , typically @xmath14 = 0.060.15 mag ( sandage 1990a ) .",
    "though the @xmath9 variation from cluster to cluster over a broad range in [ fe / h ] is not so well understood , it is clear that rr lyrae stars have the potential to be excellent standard candles .",
    "historically , there has been discussion over the slope of the @xmath9[fe / h ] relation , with values ranging between @xmath15[fe / h ] = 0 to 0.4 mag dex@xmath5 ( corresponding to a globular cluster age range of @xmath165 gyr to approximately zero ) .",
    "recently , a consensus has begun to form that the slope has a value of 0.150.20 ( e.g. , carney _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 and chaboyer 1995 , though see sandage 1993 and mazzitelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 for dissenting opinions ) .",
    "however , the zero - point of the relationship continues to defy a consensus . at the characteristic abundance of the halo , [ fe / h ] = 1.6",
    ", @xmath9 values range from 0.45 to 0.75 mag , and usually fall either toward the brighter or the fainter end of this range .",
    "chaboyer ( 1995 ) showed that this `` two value '' effect translates to a @xmath1722% difference in the derived ages of the galactic globular clusters , and in fact represents the dominant uncertainty in the determination of cluster ages .",
    "a number of methods have been used to estimate @xmath9 , including baade - wesselink ( surface brightness ) analyses ( jones _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , main sequence fitting of globular clusters ( buonanno _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , application of stellar pulsation theory to field stars ( sandage 1990b ) , horizontal branch evolution theory ( lee _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) , calibrating the lmc rr lyraes using other lmc distance estimates ( walker 1992 , gould 1995 ) , and the statistical parallax method ( hawley _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , strugnell _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) .",
    "the essence of the statistical parallax ( `` stat-@xmath18 '' ) method is to balance the radial - velocity - derived kinematics of a homogeneous stellar sample with its kinematics as derived from proper motions .",
    "the former are independent of distance , while the latter are distance - dependent .",
    "they are balanced through a simultaneous solution for a distance scale factor .",
    "( 1986 ) discussed the stat-@xmath18 solutions performed prior to 1985 , and described the shortcomings in the methods that were employed .",
    "they argued that only a complete treatment using a maximum - likelihood formulation , together with a minimization technique which is tolerant of inter - dependent variables , can produce accurate solutions .",
    "two modern studies have employed these techniques ( hawley _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , and strugnell _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , hereafter referred to as hjbw and srm , respectively ) .",
    "hjbw compiled proper motion , radial velocity , apparent magnitude , and abundance data from the literature to produce a sample of @xmath17140 stars .",
    "srm employed the virtually same set of data .",
    "the two groups obtained similar values for @xmath9 , the only difference being in the details of the adopted reddenings and determination of the apparent magnitudes . both groups concluded that the sample was too small to constrain the slope of the @xmath9[fe / h ] relation .",
    "since then , considerable new data have become available , indicating that it is an opportune time for a new stat-@xmath18 analysis . the lick northern proper motion ( npm )",
    "program ( klemola , jones & hanson 1987 ) has measured absolute proper motions for over 1000 rr lyrae stars .",
    "these data are more uniform and have a more accurate zero - point than the proper motions employed in previous analyses , mainly because the plates , obtained from a single telescope and covering most of the northern hemisphere , were measured and reduced onto a single inertial frame tied to external galaxies . meanwhile , layden ( 1994 ) determined abundances and radial velocities for over 300 rr lyraes , including most of those in the hjbw and srm studies .",
    "blanco ( 1992 ) showed that the abundances used in those studies were of variable accuracy and zero - point .",
    "layden s [ fe / h ] measures are on a self - consistent system and are typically accurate to 0.150.20 dex .",
    "thus , a new stat-@xmath18 solution will reap the benefits of a 50% larger sample size ( 213 stars ) and higher quality data .",
    "furthermore , layden ( 1995 ) showed that the local rr lyrae sample breaks fairly cleanly into thick disk and halo populations at [ fe / h ] = 1 .",
    "the existence of two kinematically distinct populations had not been recognized in previous stat-@xmath18 studies , in part because the existing @xmath19 abundances were of insufficient accuracy to provide the the required abundance resolution . as a result , the two populations had been mixed .",
    "one worries that such mixing might have resulted in the @xmath9[fe / h ] slope being under - estimated . in the worst case ,",
    "population mixing might lead to errant solutions , since the stat-@xmath18 method is a simultaneous solution for kinematics and @xmath9 .",
    "we consider it safest to treat the disk and halo separately in our solutions .",
    "this paper reports the findings of our new stat-@xmath18 solutions , based on the improvements described above . throughout the paper ,",
    "we employ the stat-@xmath18 code used by hjbw . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe in detail the data used in our stat-@xmath18 solutions . in sec . 3 , we begin our analysis with an inverted approach",
    "; we assume an @xmath9[fe / h ] relation , and compute the distance and three space velocity components of each rr lyrae star in our sample .",
    "this gives us insight into how best to divide the sample during the stat-@xmath18 solutions . in sec .",
    "4 , we present monte carlo simulations which enable us to investigate the accuracy of our solutions , and to search for any inherent biases produced by the stat-@xmath18 technique . in sec . 5 , we present the absolute magnitude and kinematic results of the stat-@xmath18 solutions for the observed stars . in sec .",
    "6 , we compare our @xmath9 results with those obtained by other authors using other techniques . in sec",
    ". 7 , we discuss the implications of our results for some basic properties of the galaxy and the universe .",
    "we close with a short summary of our findings .",
    "our primary source of proper motions for this study is the lick northern proper motion ( npm ) program ( klemola , jones & hanson 1987 ) .",
    "the npm program is a photographic survey measuring precise absolute proper motions , on an inertial system defined by 50,000 faint galaxies ( @xmath20 ) , for over 300,000 stars with @xmath21 , covering the northern two - thirds of the sky ( @xmath22 ) , based on plates taken between 1947 and 1988 with the lick 51  cm carnegie double astrograph .",
    "details of the npm observing , plate measurement , and reduction procedures are given by klemola _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "part  i of the npm program , covering the 72% of the northern sky lying outside the heavily obscured regions of the milky way , was completed in 1993 , with the release of the lick npm1 catalog ( klemola , hanson & jones 1993 ; hanson 1993 ) , containing 149,000 stars .",
    "the stellar content of the npm1 catalog is detailed in the npm1 cross - identifications ( klemola , hanson & jones 1994a ; hanson & klemola 1994 ) .",
    "comprehensive error analyses ( klemola , hanson & jones 1994b ) have determined the rms error of the npm absolute proper motions to be @xmath23 in each coordinate , corresponding to a transverse velocity error @xmath24 .",
    "the npm1 catalog contains over 1000 rr lyrae variables ( klemola _ et  al .",
    "_ 1994a , appendix 2 ) .",
    "some 300 of these have @xmath25 ( corresponding to @xmath26 kpc ) and may be individually useful for stat-@xmath18 studies .",
    "the particular value of the npm proper motions for this work is that they are on an absolute reference frame .",
    "by contrast , previous rr lyrae stat-@xmath18 solutions have relied on relative proper motions , measured with respect to field stars ( generally with @xmath27 ) , and corrected to absolute by assuming the net motions of the reference stars from models of galactic kinematics and rotation .",
    "using relative proper motions inevitably raises the possibility that the resulting kinematics ( and luminosities ) may depend to some extent on the input assumptions .",
    "specifically , the hjbw and srm stat-@xmath18 solutions used the list of proper motions for 168 rr lyraes compiled by wan , mao & ji ( 1980 ; hereafter referred to as wmj ) .",
    "wmj added new relative proper motions from the shanghai observatory ( wan , he , zhu & li 1979 ) and other sources to the previous such compilation by hemenway ( 1975 ) .    because of their absolute character",
    ", we adopted the npm proper motions as the primary source for our stat-@xmath18 database .",
    "our search of the npm1 catalog , using the npm1 cross - identifications , found 171 rr lyrae stars from layden s ( 1994 ) list .",
    "however , the npm1 catalog does not cover low galactic latitudes ( @xmath28 ) , nor the southern sky below @xmath29 declination . to attain the complete sky coverage needed for reliable stat-@xmath18 solutions",
    ", we used the wmj compilation as a secondary source where npm proper motions were not available , adding another 42 stars . using the wmj data raises two practical problems :    first , should the wmj motions be corrected to the npm absolute system ?",
    "the heterogeneous nature of the wmj compilation might make any single correction doubtful .",
    "however , clube & dawe ( 1980b ) suggested that the existing rr lyrae proper motions needed a large correction `` in the direction of galactic rotation '' @xmath30 due to incorrect motions of the reference stars , making @xmath31 to 0.1  mag fainter .",
    "so large a systematic error should be easily detectable by comparing the npm and wmj proper motions .",
    "second , how should the wmj data be weighted relative to the npm motions ? wmj estimated the errors for each star from the repeatability of the existing proper motions for that star , but the number of determinations is generally small , so these estimates may not be individually reliable .",
    "for example , the range of @xmath32 is very large , some values are incredibly small ( one is zero ! ) , and the correlation between each star s right ascension and declination proper motion errors is very poor .",
    "one - fourth of the wmj stars have @xmath33 in one coordinate more than three times the value in the other coordinate . because all the sources cited in wmj used methods which should produce errors of equal size in either coordinate ,",
    "this is plainly an artifact of the wmj error analysis .",
    "however , the overall mean and rms errors ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath39 ) are quite comparable to values given in the literature ( wan _ et  al . _ 1979 ; hemenway 1975 ) , and may in fact be reliable error estimates .    to answer these questions , we compared data for the 109 stars in common between the npm1 catalog and the wmj compilation .",
    "the comparison was done twice ; using @xmath40 in equatorial coordinates ( @xmath41 ) and in galactic coordinates ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "normal probability plots ( lutz & hanson 1992 ) were used for robust estimates of the mean differences and rms dispersions .",
    "plots of @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 and magnitude were examined for any dependence on these observational variables . finally , we assessed the significance of the wmj individual proper motion errors @xmath33(wmj ) .",
    "two principal results were found , bearing on each of the questions posed above .",
    "first , the wmj proper motions in galactic longitude have a small but significant mean difference with npm1 .",
    "we found @xmath45 @xmath46 as clube & dawe ( 1980b ) suggest , such a systematic difference may reflect erroneous reference star motions , but our result is six times smaller than theirs .",
    "consequently , any effects on @xmath9 would be at the 0.01 mag level .",
    "so , there is no need to correct the wmj data for our stat-@xmath18 solutions .",
    "second , the wmj proper motion errors are only useful as an overall average , not on a star - by - star basis . figure 1 shows the npm  wmj proper motion differences versus the wmj listed errors . in each coordinate ,",
    "the stars with the smaller errors ( @xmath47 ) scatter just as much as the stars with the larger errors ( @xmath48 ) . for the very smallest errors ( @xmath49 ) the scatter is smaller , but the offsets from zero are large .",
    "a constant error describes the data much better than does the large variation in @xmath32 .",
    "figure 2 quantifies this , testing whether the rms error actually increases with @xmath33 . in each coordinate ,",
    "the 109 stars were sorted by the size of @xmath32 .",
    "figure 2 plots the running values of the rms nominal error and the actual rms dispersion of @xmath43 as a function of this rank .",
    "the nominal error @xmath50 is the quadratic sum of @xmath32 and @xmath51 .",
    "the smooth , slowly rising curve labeled `` tot '' in figure 2 is the running rms value of @xmath50 .",
    "if the wmj errors are correct , then @xmath52 , the rms dispersion of the proper motion differences , should follow this curve .",
    "the jagged line labeled `` @xmath43 '' traces the running value of the actual rms dispersion . in each coordinate",
    ", @xmath52 quickly rises to a large value ( @xmath53 in @xmath36 , @xmath54 in @xmath39 ) by rank @xmath55 , and remains at that level out to rank @xmath56 , rising somewhat at the end .",
    "this proves that the real error of the wmj proper motions is roughly constant , independent of the listed error @xmath32 .",
    "quadratically subtracting @xmath57 from these values gives @xmath58 in ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "almost identical error estimates were obtained from normal probability plots of @xmath60 .",
    "these estimates agree almost perfectly with the rms values of the wmj errors cited above .    in view of this result , we gave all wmj proper motions equal weights in our stat-@xmath18 solutions .",
    "test solutions with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , corresponding to the mean and rms wmj errors , respectively , gave very similar results .",
    "we decided to adopt the smaller value , @xmath63 , in order to weight all areas of the sky equally in the stat-@xmath18 solutions ( section 5 ) .",
    "our primary source for rr lyrae metal abundances is the work of layden ( 1994 , hereafter referred to as l94 ) .",
    "these abundances are based on the relative strengths of the k line and the balmer lines h@xmath64 through h@xmath65 , analogous to the @xmath66@xmath67 abundance technique of preston ( 1959 ) .",
    "the abundance scale is tied to the [ fe / h ] abundance scale for globular clusters developed by zinn & west ( 1984 ) , and the individual [ fe / h ] values are typically accurate to 0.150.20 dex .",
    "lambert _ et al_. ( 1995 ) have measured new high - dispersion abundances for a number of the stars in l94 , and find excellent agreement with those results .",
    "jurcsik & kovacs ( 1996 ) also discuss the high quality of the l94 abundances .",
    "previous statistical parallax solutions have used @xmath66@xmath67 values as the metallicity indicator . since then , blanco ( 1992 ) has shown that @xmath66@xmath67 values available to those authors were of variable accuracy and zero - point .",
    "the [ fe / h ] sample of l94 is both self - consistent and contains many more stars than a sample of @xmath66@xmath67 values collected from the literature .",
    "however , there are a few bright rr lyraes in the literature which are not included in the list of l94 . for these",
    ", we adopt the literature @xmath66@xmath67 values , converted to [ fe / h ] using eqn .",
    "we note that some of these values , those taken from hemenway ( 1975 ) , are actually _ inferred _ from photoelectric indices or a period - amplitude-@xmath66@xmath67 relation .",
    "we discuss these stars further in sec .",
    "l94 also measured radial velocities for the stars in his sample , and combined them with literature velocities to produce a catalog of radial velocities , the most accurate currently available , for over 300 nearby rr lyrae stars .",
    "l94 is our primary source of radial velocities .",
    "velocities for a few stars not observed by l94 were taken from the literature compilation shown in table 1 of l94 .",
    "we include these , adopting for their errors the typical errors for each source derived in sec . 2 of l94 .",
    "the existing photometry on field rr lyrae stars is a surprisingly heterogeneous data set .",
    "there are three principal works in the johnson @xmath68-band .",
    "the work of sturch ( 1966 ) is comprised mainly of observations at minimum light ; that of bookmyer _",
    "et al_. ( 1977 ) , which contains as a subset the better - known work of fitch , wisniewski & johnson ( 1966 ) , and is purported to be on the same photometric system ; and that of clube & dawe ( 1980b , hereafter referred to as cd80 ) .",
    "barnes & hawley ( 1986 , hereafter referred to as bh86 ) show that the photometric system of sturch is in good agreement with that of cd80 , and that both are offset from the work of fitch _",
    "et al._. we therefore adopt the cd80 photometry as the standard to which we will compare other photometric works .",
    "many of the existing rr lyrae light curves have incomplete phase coverage , so it is difficult to obtain their intensity - mean apparent magnitudes with accuracy .",
    "however , various relations exist in the literature which allow this quantity to be calculated from light curve extrema , rise times , etc .",
    "( e.g. , fitch _",
    "_ 1966 , cd80 ) .",
    "bh86 recomputed the coefficients for two of these methods using modern , self - consistent data , and find that the method of cd80 gives the tighter relation .",
    "we adopt this parameterization along with their coefficients , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the intensity - mean magnitude , @xmath71 is the magnitude at minimum light , and @xmath72 is the light curve amplitude . by using the cd80 photometry as the basis of our photometric system , and by employing intensity - mean magnitudes computed from the preceding equation ,",
    "our photometry system is equivalent to that of bh86 .",
    "we computed @xmath70 for the cd80 and bookmyer _",
    "et al_. data sets , and performed a linear regression between them to obtain a transformation between the two photometric data sets ( see table 1 , line 1 ) .",
    "we then adopted data values of cd80 ( 57 stars ) as the primary data , and supplemented it with the values from bookmyer _",
    "et al_. that had been transformed onto the cd80 system ( 81 additional stars ) .",
    "the resulting data set was used to transform the walraven photometry of lub ( 1977 ) onto the cd80 system .",
    "the transformation , given in line 2 of table 1 , is in close agreement with the relation of pel ( 1976 ) .",
    "this resulted in 7 additional stars being added to the data set .",
    "this data set was then used to transform the ccd photometry of schmidt _ et al _ ( 1991 , 1995 ) onto the cd80 system ( see line 3 of table 1 ) , adding 36 stars to the database .",
    "preliminary photometry from layden ( 1996 ; 8 stars ) was also included , though no transformations were possible since there were no stars in common with the database .",
    "data for 24 additional stars were adopted from the photometric compilation of l94 ( his table 9 ) , after converting from the @xmath70 definition of fitch _ et al .",
    "_ 1966 to that of cd80 .    clearly , this approach is not ideal , since it relies on the statistical transformations between photometric systems , and assumes that the cd80 system is equivalent to the modern systems used by observers ( e.g. , landolt 1992 ) and theorists ( e.g. , lee _ et al .",
    "the approach has the advantage of reducing systematic errors by placing all the stars on the same photometric system .",
    "ultimately , the transformations result in changes , typically 0.07 mag , which are small compared to the 0.20.3 mag disagreements which arise between different methods of measuring @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the sense of the transformation is to brighten the literature values ; had we used the fainter photometry , the @xmath9 values we derived would have been fainter as well . obtaining self - consistent photometry at",
    "the level of several hundredths of a magnitude is a problem shared , but seldom mentioned , by all observers attempting to measure @xmath9 .",
    "srm argued that reddenings derived from the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) reddening maps provide the most accurate and consistent estimates of rr lyrae reddenings , and hence absorption ( we assume @xmath73 = 3.1 ) .",
    "we therefore use burstein & heiles values when they are available , i.e. , for stars more than 10@xmath74 from the galactic plane .",
    "we reduce their tabulated reddenings by an amount consistent with a uniform dust distribution with an exponential scale height of 100 pc ( see l94 ) . in most cases",
    "this is a small or negligible correction .    for stars less than 10@xmath74 from the plane",
    ", we adopt the reddening values given by blanco ( 1992 ) , which are derived from the stars colors at minimum light .",
    "when neither are available , we interpolate between the burstein & heiles reddening at @xmath7510@xmath74 , and that of fitzgerald ( 1968 , 1987 ) at @xmath750.5@xmath74 , at the longitude of the star . the latter is clearly a poor solution , but it is the best available until accurate minimum - light colors can be obtained for these stars .",
    "fortunately , it was used for only 9 stars .      using the data sources described above",
    ", we find that 213 stars have values for all five of the fundamental data types : proper motion , abundance , radial velocity , apparent magnitude , and reddening .",
    "this is substantially more than were used in the recent studies of hjbw ( 142 stars ) and srm ( 139 stars ) .",
    "note that we do not consider bailey type-@xmath76 rr lyraes in this study , only type-@xmath77 stars .",
    "this database is presented in table 2 .",
    "the first column gives the variable star name , and the second column gives the npm1 catalog number .",
    "following this are the galactic longitude and latitude ( in degrees ) and the adopted proper motions in right ascension and declination ( in arcsec cen@xmath5 ) .",
    "the seventh and eighth columns give the adopted radial velocity and its error ( in km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "next is the adopted abundance , [ fe / h ] .",
    "the tenth column gives the adopted intensity - mean apparent @xmath68 magnitude , and the eleventh column gives the adopted interstellar absorption .",
    "the twelfth column gives references for the sources of the proper motion , abundance , photometry , and interstellar absorption , as listed at the end of the table .",
    "the final column indicates whether a star was treated as a disk ( 1 ) or halo ( 0 ) star under the three disk / halo definitions discussed in sec .",
    "3 . npm proper motions are used for 171 of the 213 stars in our sample .",
    "abundances from l94 are used for 187 of the stars , and apparent magnitudes computed directly from @xmath68band photometry are used for 182 of the stars .    given the dominance of npm proper motions in our catalog , one wonders if the distribution of stars on the sky is skewed , and whether this would introduce a bias into our stat-@xmath18 solutions ( e.g. , croswell , latham & carney 1987 ) . regarding the former , we find that 63% of our sample lies above the celestial equator ; we are weighted to the north celestial hemisphere , but not overwhelmingly so .",
    "similarly , 67% of our stars lie north of the galactic plane",
    ". however , these asymmetries can not produce the kind of biases discussed by croswell _",
    ", since our sample contains no proper motion bias . as klemola _",
    "( 1987 ) describe , samples of `` astrophysically interesting '' stars , such as rr lyraes , were selected for the npm program in advance of the plate measurements , and no star was omitted from the npm1 catalog because its measured proper motion proved to be small .",
    "this type of pre - selection is true of our secondary proper motion source as well . as confirmation",
    ", we note that our data show no sign of the `` croswell effect . ''",
    "the number of stars moving away from the galactic plane is almost identical to the number moving toward it : 106 @xmath78 108 , respectively .    finally , we note specifics of interest concerning several stars .",

    "( 1995 ) to be an eclipsing binary rather than an rr lyrae ( kholopov 1985 ) ; it was removed from our database .",
    "( 2 ) l94 found sv boo to have [ fe / h ] = 0.43 from a single low - quality spectrum , whereas hemenway ( 1975 ) quoted @xmath66@xmath67 = 7 ( [ fe / h]@xmath79 = 1.55 ) . since the kinematics of sv boo suggest it belongs to the halo , we adopt the hemenway abundance .",
    "( 3 ) the radial velocity of bb pup was revised to 98 @xmath75 9 km  s@xmath5 from that in l94 by eliminating the outlier velocity 255 @xmath75 16 km  s@xmath5 from the list in table 2 of l94 .",
    "( 4 ) for three stars , ae dra , bd dra , and bk eri , the proper motion was improved by removing one discordant measurement from the average value quoted in the npm1 catalog .",
    "( 5 ) the seven stars listed with the abundance source `` 3 '' in table 2 all had photometrically - determined [ fe / h ] values from hemenway ( 1975 ; see sec .",
    "2.2 ) which suggested that they were thick disk stars .",
    "however , their kinematics suggested that all seven stars are halo members .",
    "we therefore set [ fe / h ] = 1.5 for these stars .",
    "( 6 ) we found that rx cvn historically has been misidentified . the proper motion of wmj and the radial velocity of joy ( 1950 ) give a space velocity greater than the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the npm proper motion and the radial velocity measured by l94 ( see our table 2 ) give a reasonable space velocity for a halo star",
    ". inspection of the npm plates shows that the measured star has a nearby companion , probably a foreground dwarf , which was probably mistakenly observed by wmj and joy .",
    "the rr lyrae is the eastern - most of the pair .",
    "layden ( 1995 , hereafter referred to as l95 ) showed that the rr lyraes separate into a halo and a ( primarily thick ) disk population at [ fe / h ] = 1.0 .",
    "we wish to see if this separation persists using our improved database",
    ".    to do this , we computed provisional distances to the stars in our sample using the @xmath9[fe / h ] relationship of carney , storm & jones ( 1992 , hereafter referred to as csj ) , @xmath9 = 0.15[fe / h ] + 1.01 mag .",
    "we then computed the stars @xmath80 , @xmath68 , @xmath81 space velocities , following johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) with one exception : we take @xmath80 as positive outward . at distances of 12 kpc , typical of the distances in our sample , the sun - oriented @xmath80 , @xmath68",
    ", @xmath81 frame can be misaligned by a small angle in the @xmath80 , @xmath68 plane ( @xmath82 deg ) from the cylindrical galactic directions ( @xmath18 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) at each star .",
    "so , we rotated the @xmath80 , @xmath68 , @xmath81 velocities into the @xmath18 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 frame , after adding to @xmath68 the iau standard rotational velocity @xmath85 km s@xmath5 ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) , and after adding the `` dynamical '' solar motion ( 9 , + 12 , + 7 km s@xmath5 ; mihalas & binney 1981 , p.400 ) to correct @xmath80 , @xmath68 , @xmath81 to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the results are the velocity components @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , where @xmath86 increases outwards from the axis of galactic rotation , @xmath87 increases in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath88 increases toward the north galactic pole .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath86 and @xmath88 plotted against @xmath87 . clearly , the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath89 1.0 have large velocity dispersions and little net galactic rotation , typical of the halo .",
    "meanwhile , the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath90 are clustered around @xmath87 @xmath91 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath87 as a function of abundance .",
    "while the distribution of stars in figures 3 and 4 is consistent with the first - order view of a disk / halo separation at [ fe / h ] = 1.0 , there are four stars with @xmath87 @xmath92 km  s@xmath5 at [ fe / h ] @xmath93 , whose extreme kinematics clearly mark them as members of the halo . similarly , there may be an excess of stars with @xmath87 @xmath94 km  s@xmath5 at [ fe / h ] @xmath95 , which may belong to the `` metal - weak thick disk '' ( mwtd ; morrison , flynn & freeman 1990 ) .",
    "l95 discussed the presence of such stars in his sample of rr lyraes .",
    "it is not possible to assign these stars individually to the disk or halo populations without ambiguity .",
    "we therefore separate the disk from the halo using three distinct definitions , and perform the stat-@xmath18 solutions for each set of definitions , in order to test the effects of the different definitions on the derived kinematics and absolute magnitudes .",
    "the three disk / halo separation definitions are summarized in table 3 .",
    "all three definitions assign the four low-@xmath87 stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath90 to the halo .",
    "the first definition , similar to that of nissen & schuster ( 1991 ) , admits a small number of mwtd rr lyraes , primarily with @xmath96 [ fe / h ] @xmath95 , in agreement with l95 .",
    "the second assumes that no mwtd ( [ fe / h ] @xmath95 ) rr lyraes exist .",
    "the third definition admits a larger population of mwtd rr lyraes , which reaches to [ fe / h ] @xmath97 , more along the lines of the population of red giants described by morrison _ et al_. ( 1990 ) .",

    "we have moved these stars into the corresponding halo definitions , as noted in table 3 .",
    "we note that the choice of @xmath9[fe / h ] relations used to compute the distances does not significantly affect the separation .",
    "only one star crosses the sloping disk / halo line in fig .",

    "in sec . 5 we will present the stat-@xmath18 analysis of our data . first , however , we will test the hjbw stat-@xmath18 algorithm itself , using synthetic data with known properties ( positions , velocities , @xmath9 , etc . ) .",
    "this step seems vital to ensure reliable results .",
    "specifically , we test : ( 1 ) how accurately the stat-@xmath18 solutions reproduce the kinematics and luminosities of the input data ; ( 2 ) how reliable the error estimates are ; ( 3 ) the sensitivity to the number of stars and their distribution on the sky ; ( 4 ) whether all the free parameters in the hjbw stat-@xmath18 algorithm are necessary ; ( 5 ) whether the small misalignment ( sec .",

    "the hjbw algorithm uses a simplex optimization technique to maximize the likelihood in murray s ( 1983 ) kinematic model ( also used by srm ) .",
    "there are 11 free parameters : the solar motion ( @xmath101 ) , the velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath102 ) with three covariances ( @xmath103 ) to allow an arbitrary orientation , the distance scale parameter @xmath104 and its dispersion @xmath105 .",
    "the solution also returns an approximate standard error estimate @xmath106 for each parameter .",

    "we refer the reader to hjbw for full details of the stat-@xmath18 algorithm .",
    "we made two modifications to the hjbw procedure : ( 1 ) we fixed an error which caused the large velocity dispersion errors listed in table 2 of hjbw ; and ( 2 ) when necessary , we inspected the data to reject extreme outliers and repeated the solutions .      to perform monte carlo tests we generated an ensemble of simulated data sets as outlined in table 4 .",

    "space velocities ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath112 ) were generated from a gaussian velocity ellipsoid whose parameters are given in table 4 .",
    "each star s right ascension , declination , proper motion , radial velocity , and apparent magnitude were then calculated , with gaussian observational errors 0.5 arcsec cen@xmath5 and 20 km s@xmath5 added to the proper motion components and the radial velocity , respectively . for each simulation ( h1 , d1 ) we created @xmath113 different data sets ;",

    "2 , the actual distribution of our rr lyraes on the sky is far from uniform . to test whether this affects the stat-@xmath18 results , we prepared alternate data sets ( h2 , d2 ) using the observed sky positions , apparent magnitudes , and metallicities from table 2 , with the disk-1/halo-1 separation of table 3 .",
    "then , @xmath114 sets of synthetic proper motions and radial velocities were randomly generated as above .",
    "for each data set ( h1 , h2 , d1 , d2 ) , stat-@xmath18 solutions were performed as outlined in column 6 of table 4 .",
    "multiple solution sets tested particular parameters in the hjbw model . to test the effect of the hjbw distance scale dispersion parameter @xmath105 we ran two solutions for each halo data set , with @xmath116 as indicated in column 7 of table 4 .",
    "these solutions will be discussed in sec .",
    "4.6 . for the data sets h2 and",
    "d2 we ran solutions with and without the velocity covariance parameters ( @xmath117 ) , as indicated in column 8 of table 4 .",
    "the reasons for this will be discussed in sec .",

    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "before discussing the stat-@xmath18 solutions , we need to deal with an apparent inconsistency between the data simulations and the hjbw solution method .",
    "we generated our simulated velocities using velocity ellipsoids oriented to the cylindrical coordinate frame ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath112 ) which is physically the most appropriate frame for galactic velocities .",
    "however , the hjbw algorithm uses the ( @xmath101 ) rectangular coordinate frame to compute the solar motion and stellar velocity dispersions . in sec . 3",
    ", we noted that the ( @xmath119 ) coordinates can be misaligned with ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath112 ) , by a small angle ( rms @xmath120 deg ) .",
    "it is important to show that any effects of this misalignment are too small to significantly affect our results .",
    "we can do this directly with the simulated data , because for every star we know the space velocity in each coordinate frame .",
    "this lets us measure , for every data set , any differences ( 1 ) between @xmath121 and @xmath122 and ( 2 ) between @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we refer to the values computed directly from the simulated data as the `` true '' values for the data set .    for the halo ( h1 , h2 ) ,",
    "the principal effect is the projection of the long axis of the velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath125 ) partly onto the @xmath68 axis , increasing @xmath14 at the expense of @xmath126 .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath127 km s@xmath5 , and @xmath128 km s@xmath5 . clearly , these effects are far too small to be of any concern here .",
    "for the disk ( d1 , d2 ) , the principal effect of coordinate misalignment is the partial projection of the rotation vector @xmath129 km s@xmath5 onto the @xmath80 axis .",
    "distant stars in the direction of galactic rotation @xmath130 get a negative contribution to their @xmath80 velocity ; stars toward ( 270,0 ) get a positive contribution .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath131  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "also , @xmath132 is decreased by 1 km s@xmath5 .",
    "again , these effects are considerably smaller than the observational errors , and can be neglected in practice .",
    "stat-@xmath18 solutions for each of the 25 halo and 40 disk data sets were performed as outlined in table 4 .",
    "the results for each set of solutions are summarized in table 5 .",
    "the left side of table 5 gives results for the @xmath68 component of the solar motion , the three velocity dispersions ( @xmath133 ) , and @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath66 values on the right side of table 5 represent the differences ( solution @xmath134 `` true '' ) for each quantity .",
    "table 5 omits the @xmath80 and @xmath81 solar motion components , as these were always equal to the true values to @xmath135 km s@xmath5 .",
    "each solution set in table 5 lists two rows of results .",
    "the first row gives the mean of each quantity .",
    "the second row gives two different estimates of the uncertainty in the quantity : @xmath136 ( left side of table 5 ) gives the mean of the internal error estimates returned by the hjbw code for each parameter , while sd ( right side ) gives the rms dispersion about each mean difference .",
    "the latter external error estimates reflect how precisely the stat-@xmath18 program returns the `` true '' values .",
    "the values in row 5 of table 5 are more precise than those quoted for the other halo simulations , since they are based on 20 rather than 5 data sets .",
    "the major result of the monte carlo simulations is that the hjbw algorithm does an excellent job of returning the `` true '' input parameters , to within a few km s@xmath5 for the velocities and dispersions , and to within @xmath137 mag for @xmath107 .",
    "this is true for both the halo and the disk simulations , and for both the random and real space distributions .",
    "furthermore , in nearly all cases the external errors ( sd s of the @xmath66 s ) are no larger than the hjbw program s internal error estimates @xmath138 , and in some cases they are considerably smaller .",
    "detailed examination of table 5 shows some small systematic effects which are worth considering further .",
    "note that 7 out of 8 @xmath139 values are positive , all 24 @xmath140 values are negative , and 7 out of 8 @xmath141 values are positive .",
    "examination of the individual solutions shows that these same effects occur on a solution - by - solution basis , with @xmath68 , @xmath123 , and @xmath107 all varying in tandem , linked together by the hjbw distance scale parameter @xmath104 .",
    "the average values are slightly biased toward a `` short '' distance scale ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "this bias is larger for the real space distribution data sets ( h2 , d2 ) than for the random sets ( h1 , d1 ) . whether we can or should correct for this small bias will be discussed in sec .",
    "4.8 .    for the halo ( h ) solutions , the internal error estimates @xmath143 returned by the hjbw program tend to be larger than the external errors",
    "for example , @xmath138 for @xmath107 is 0.12 mag , while the sd of @xmath144 averages 0.08 mag . for the kinematic parameters , @xmath145/sd @xmath146 .",
    "these results indicate that the real accuracy of the halo solutions may be better than the internal errors claim .",
    "however , given the simplified nature of the simulations , we will conservatively adopt the internal error estimates in discussing our real data solutions ( sec .",
    "5 ) .    for the disk ( d ) solutions ,",
    "the internal and external errors for @xmath107 generally agree , though there is a small discrepancy for the kinematic parameters , @xmath145/sd @xmath147 .",
    "in addition , the standard error of @xmath107 is @xmath170.3 mag , 34 times as large as for the halo .",
    "the failure of the @xmath107 errors to follow an @xmath148 relation may mean that @xmath149 is near the lower limit for successful solutions ( see sec .",
    "4.5 ) , but it must also reflect the fact that the stat-@xmath18 method inherently works better for a population with a larger velocity dispersion .    the test solutions ( h1.0 , h2.0 ) with the hjbw distance scale dispersion parameter @xmath105 set to zero will be discussed in section 4.6 .",
    "the test solutions ( h2d , d2d ) without the velocity ellipsoid covariances ( @xmath103 ) will be discussed in section 4.7 .      since the number of stars in our disk samples ( both real and synthetic data ) is near or below the lower limit ( 50 stars ) that hjbw found necessary for successful solutions , we need to ask how reliable our disk solutions can be with so few stars .",
    "the symptom of having too few stars is that the hjbw likelihood function becomes ill - conditioned , and the iterative solution fails to converge to finite output parameters ( hence @xmath118 in table 4 ) .",
    "surprisingly , given the hjbw result , over 90% of our monte carlo disk solutions , and all 3 real - data disk solutions ( sec .",
    "5 ) did in fact converge .",
    "moreover , table 5 shows that the disk output parameters are well - determined , i.e. , they have little bias and accurate error estimates .",
    "the convergence of our monte carlo solutions for @xmath150 may reflect the gaussian nature of our simulations , in contrast to the vagaries of the real data that hjbw used . in our experience , the hjbw algorithm is not resistant to large outliers ; for real data , this makes the disk / halo separation quite critical .",
    "the success of our real - data disk solutions for @xmath151 is most likely due to the better separation we achieved using [ fe / h ] and @xmath152 ( sec .",
    "4 ) instead of @xmath19 and period ( hjbw ) .    without doing many more simulations ,",
    "it is not possible for us to state what the true lower limit on @xmath115 may be . nor is this necessary , since the clear result of our monte carlo simulations is that solutions that do converge give reliable results .",
    "both hjbw and srm found a strong correlation in their stat-@xmath18 solutions between @xmath9 and @xmath153 , the cosmic dispersion in @xmath9 . in the murray ( 1983 )",
    "model , the cosmic dispersion is parameterized by @xmath105 , the dispersion in the distance scale parameter @xmath104 .",
    "this correlation effectively prevents solving for @xmath105 ; instead this parameter must be fixed at a value chosen to represent a reasonable value of @xmath153 .",
    "equation 8 of hjbw relates @xmath153 , @xmath105 , and @xmath104 . for @xmath154 , @xmath155 . for @xmath156 and @xmath157 from our solutions , @xmath158  mag .",
    "observations show this to be a reasonable range of @xmath153 .",
    "sandage ( 1990a ) found the intrinsic dispersion of rr lyrae magnitudes within a globular cluster ( i.e. , at a single metallicity ) to be @xmath14 = 0.060.15 mag .",
    "for our field rr lyraes there will be an additional dispersion @xmath159 proportional to the slope of the @xmath9[fe / h ] relation .",
    "we estimated @xmath159 numerically by populating various @xmath9[fe / h ] relations with `` stars '' having the [ fe / h ] distribution of our halo sample .",
    "the total @xmath153 is then the quadratic sum of @xmath14 and @xmath159 . for @xmath160  mag , using the csj @xmath9[fe / h ] relation ( slope = + 0.15  mag  dex@xmath5 ) we obtain @xmath161  mag .",
    "using the steeper slope ( + 0.39 ) advocated by sandage ( 1990b ) gives @xmath162  mag .",
    "to reach @xmath163  mag , we must adopt an extreme value of @xmath164  mag along with the sandage ( 1990b ) slope .",
    "consequently , a reasonable range of @xmath105 to test in our monte carlo solutions is @xmath165 .",
    "solution sets ( h1.0 , h1 ) and ( h2.0 , h2 ) with @xmath166 respectively ( table 4 ) let us evaluate the effects on @xmath9 . the results in table 5 indicate that @xmath9 comes out @xmath170.03 mag brighter for @xmath156 than for @xmath167 .",
    "similar results were found by hjbw and srm .",
    "table 5 shows that the assumed value of @xmath105 does not affect the derived kinematics .",
    "clearly , our choice of @xmath105 will only have a small effect on our stat-@xmath18 results . to be conservative ,",
    "we will adopt @xmath156 to analyze our real data ( sec .",
    "5 ) . for a given solution the true value of @xmath9",
    "thus may be a few hundredths of a magnitude fainter than the value we derive .",
    "three of the 11 parameters in the murray ( 1983 ) model are the covariances ( @xmath168 which allow the velocity ellipsoid to have an arbitrary orientation with respect to the principal galactic directions .",
    "the results of hjbw strongly suggest that this may not be necessary in practice .",
    "given the apparent benefits of eliminating unneeded parameters from the model ( especially for the disk , where @xmath169 does not greatly exceed the number of free parameters ) , it seems wise to use our monte carlo simulations to test whether the covariances ( @xmath103 ) are needed in our real - data stat-@xmath18 solutions .",
    "because our simulated data were generated with no correlations among the ( @xmath101 ) velocities , the covariances ( @xmath117 ) returned by the stat-@xmath18 solutions simply reflect random scatter in the data .",
    "thus the covariances for the real - data solutions can be tested for statistical significance by comparison with the monte carlo simulations .    to do this , for each stat-@xmath18 solution we calculated the correlation coefficients ( cc s ) @xmath170 ,   etc .",
    "for each of the sets of simulated data listed in table 4 , we computed the mean , sd , and range of the cc s of the individual trials .",
    "for all the simulations , the mean correlations were near zero , as expected .",
    "for the halo , ( both h1 and h2 ) each of the three sd s was @xmath171 . by comparison ,",
    "the rms value of the real - data halo cc s was 0.10 , with none of the cc s exceeding the range of the simulated values .",
    "for the disk , the sd s were @xmath172 for set d1 ( random space distribution ) , and @xmath173 for set d2 ( real space distribution ) .",
    "the rms value of the real - data disk cc s was 0.13 ; again none of the cc s exceeded the range of the simulated values .    from these tests",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence , for either the halo or the disk rr lyraes , that the velocity ellipsoid deviates from the principal directions ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "consequently , we can run our stat-@xmath18 solutions with the covariance parameters ( @xmath174 ) removed from the model .",
    "the entries in table 5 for solution sets h2d and d2d show the results of these solutions on the data sets h2 and d2 .",
    "there is little difference in the kinematics or absolute magnitudes produced by the new solutions , save for a slight tendency for the errors to be reduced . analyzing our real data ( sec .",
    "5 ) without the unneeded covariances reduced the disk @xmath107 errors by 10% .      in sec .",
    "4.4 we found that the results in table 5 suggested that the stat-@xmath18 solutions may be slightly biased toward a `` short '' distance scale .",
    "the solution velocities are consistently several per cent too small , and @xmath175  mag too faint .",
    "the bias was largest ( @xmath176  mag ) for the data set d2 , the disk simulation with the space distribution of the real rr lyraes .",
    "although this bias is much less than the random error ( @xmath177  mag ) of a single disk solution , it may still be worth applying corrections to our real - data results ( sec .",
    "the above - mentioned bias toward a `` short '' distance scale should not be confused with a bias toward the _ fainter _ @xmath107 regime discussed in secs . 1 , 6 , and 7 ( i.e. , toward @xmath178 mag at [ fe / h ] @xmath97 , rather than + 0.4 mag ) .",
    "it can easily be demonstrated that our solutions have no intrinsic bias toward any particular @xmath107 value ; nor are the solutions biased by the choice of the starting value @xmath108 .",
    "tests using simulated data sets based on @xmath9 0.5 mag brighter than the csj relation adopted in sec .",
    "4.2 correctly returned @xmath107 values 0.5 mag brighter , with unchanged kinematics .",
    "these results were recovered exactly when a brighter starting value @xmath179 was used , and to within @xmath180 mag in @xmath107 and @xmath181% in the velocities even when the usual @xmath182 was used .    in the spirit of exploratory data analysis , we plotted @xmath144 versus the `` solution '' and `` true '' values of the velocities ( @xmath183 and dispersions @xmath123 for all 65 simulations .",
    "this led to the discovery that , for the real space distribution sets ( h2 , d2 ) , the bias was smallest when the velocity ellipsoid was `` long '' , i.e. when @xmath184 , and largest when the velocity ellipsoid was `` round '' , i.e. when @xmath185 . thus the disk is chiefly affected , while the halo is not .",
    "the 15 additional h2d solutions outlined in table 4 were performed to illuminate this situation .",
    "figure 5 plots @xmath144 as a function of @xmath186 for solution sets h2d and d2d .",
    "because of their markedly different distributions on the sky , we consider the halo and disk separately in fig .",
    "5 . for the halo , the small bias ( @xmath187 mag ) is well - determined because of the increased number of h2d solutions , but the slope is not statistically significant . for the disk , both",
    "the mean bias ( + 0.13 mag ) and the slope ( 0.69 mag ) are 2-@xmath188 significant .",

    ", we will also correct the disk kinematics for the `` short '' distance scale by enlarging the velocities and dispersions by a factor of @xmath190 .",
    "two objections may be raised to these corrections : first , that the reason for the bias is not understood , and second , that the `` true '' value of @xmath189 is not known for the real data",
    ". the latter problem can be overcome by computing @xmath126 and @xmath14 directly from the data , as in sec .",
    "3 . because we only need the ratio @xmath189 , any distance dependence from the assumed @xmath9[fe / h ] relation cancels out .",
    "it remains mysterious to us why the disk stat-@xmath18 solutions are slightly biased when the velocity ellipsoid is `` round '' .",
    "since the effect occurs for the real ( but not a random ) stellar distribution , it must be caused by the the uneven distribution of the disk rr lyraes on the sky .",
    "it might be possible to solve this puzzle with a much larger set of simulations , but that is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that maximum - likelihood methods in general are not unbiased ; clube & dawe ( 1980a ) found an equal @xmath107 bias ( @xmath191  mag ) in the opposite direction !",
    "we conclude simply that since our disk @xmath107 bias is relatively large and can be calibrated as a function of the observational variables , we should apply it to our real - data solutions .",
    "applying the lessons learned from our monte carlo simulations ( sec .",
    "4 ) , we analyzed our real data ( each of the disk / halo subsamples in table 3 ) by running the stat-@xmath18 program with @xmath156 and performing two sets of solutions , with and without the velocity ellipsoid covariances ( @xmath103 ) .",

    "most important , the errors returned by the stat-@xmath18 program for the disk data sets were typically 10% smaller without the covariances , presumably owing to the larger number of degrees of freedom attained by removing three free parameters from the solutions . since the correlation coefficients ( @xmath193 ) did not prove to be significant ( sec .",

    "the final column of table 6 shows the @xmath9 values after correction for the @xmath195 bias discussed in sec .",
    "examination of table 6 shows that the kinematics of the rr lyraes do not depend significantly on which disk / halo definition is employed . because definition 3 of table 3 gives the purest halo sample and the largest , best - determined disk sample , we adopt halo-3 and disk-3 as our best solutions in table 6 . thus , our best estimates of the net rotation and velocity ellipsoid of the halo rr lyraes are @xmath196 @xmath197 for the disk rr lyraes , after correcting ( by a factor of 1.07 ) for the distance scale bias ( @xmath198 mag , sec .",

    "these kinematic values are in excellent agreement with the rr lyrae kinematics derived by l95 .",
    "they also correspond quite well with the kinematics of the thick disk and halo based on other tracer populations ( _ cf .",
    "_ casertano _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; l95 table 8) , with two possible exceptions .",
    "first , the vertical velocity dispersion of the disk , @xmath201 km  s@xmath5 , is somewhat smaller than the typically quoted value of 3545 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "l95 suggested that the rr lyrae `` disk '' subsample contains stars from both the thick disk and the old thin disk populations , such that the net kinematics are intermediate between the two .",
    "unfortunately , the disk sample contains too few stars for us to subdivide it and perform meaningful stat-@xmath18 solutions for separate thin and thick disk components .",
    "second , @xmath126 for the halo rr lyraes is large compared to many other estimates , 168 km  s@xmath5 @xmath78 120155 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the cause of this effect is less clear",
    ". it may be due to our removing interloper thick disk stars more completely than other studies ( l95 ) , or it may be related to a subtle selection bias experienced by rr lyraes .",
    "for example , if the halo is composed of an accreted component and a dissipatively - formed component ( zinn 1993 , majewski 1993 ) , if the components have different kinematics ( e.g. , beers 1996 ) , and if rr lyraes are more easily formed in one component than the other , then using rr lyraes as kinematic tracers would bias the kinematic results to favor one or the other halo components , relative to their representation in samples using other stellar tracers . at present , it seems that the halo rr lyraes may be preferentially tracing the accreted halo component , though a detailed analysis outside the scope of this paper is required to further address this problem .      in table 6 , @xmath107 is virtually the same for each of the three halo definitions .",

    "both effects are largely due to the relatively small number of stars in the disk solutions .",
    "again we adopt disk-3 as the best solution .",
    "since the disk velocity ellipsoid is quite `` round '' ( @xmath205 ) , a bias correction of @xmath206  mag ( figure 5 ) was subtracted from the solution value , giving @xmath207 } \\rangle = -0.76.\\ ] ]      to see what would have happened had we been unable to separate the disk and halo rr lyraes , we performed a stat-@xmath18 solution ( last line of table 6 ) using all 213 stars .",
    "this solution is comparable to `` group rr  @xmath77 '' of hjbw ( 142 stars ) and to `` sample c@xmath208 '' ( 139 stars ) of srm .",
    "interestingly , the absolute magnitude ( @xmath209 ) for our `` all stars '' solution is almost exactly the same as for the three halo solutions , but the kinematics are rather different .",
    "for this mixture of disk and halo , @xmath132 , @xmath126 , and @xmath210 are smaller than for the pure halo , but @xmath14 is larger .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is much `` rounder '' ; @xmath211 , vs. 1.65 for halo-3 .",
    "hjbw and srm found @xmath212 1.25 and 1.29 , respectively , for the comparable groups .",
    "these results point out that a good disk / halo separation is necessary to get reliable kinematic results for the rr lyraes .",
    "the stat-@xmath18 method is robust enough to produce solutions for mixed populations with distinctly different kinematics , successfully determining @xmath107 , but it derives kinematics not accurately representing either population .      the fact that we have separate disk and halo solutions over a range of almost 1 dex in [ fe / h ] gives hope that we might obtain the slope of the @xmath9[fe / h ] relationship , a parameter of considerable astrophysical importance ( sec .",

    "it may be possible to avoid this problem by incorporating the [ fe / h ] dependence into the distance scale correction @xmath104 rather than @xmath108 ; we are continuing to work on this problem , and any results will be reported in a future paper .",
    "in sec . 1 , we mentioned the long history of efforts to determine @xmath9 .",
    "csj provide an extensive review of much of this work , which we shall not repeat here .",
    "table 7 presents the results of some of these efforts .",
    "values produced by the stat-@xmath18 method are for `` typical '' rr lyraes in the sample .",
    "these stars tend to be somewhat evolved off the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) .",
    "some @xmath9 estimates using different methods refer to @xmath9 at the zahb .",
    "we note these cases in table 7 , where we have corrected @xmath217 to @xmath9 using the eqn . 4 of csj .",
    "] they are plotted as a function of [ fe / h ] in figure 7 to facilitate comparison with the results of our stat-@xmath18 solutions .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the individual references in table 7 for more detailed discussions on these methods .",
    "we begin by noting that our stat-@xmath18 solutions are in good agreement with the results of the two recent applications of the method ( @xmath218 , bh86 ; @xmath219 , srm ) .",
    "this is not a complete surprise , given that the stars in those studies are all included in the present study , albeit with improved data .",
    "as shown in table 7 and figure 7 , the agreement between the various stat-@xmath18 solutions becomes even better when small corrections are made to bring the previous results onto the system of reddenings and magnitudes used in this paper .",
    "like us , neither of the previous groups was able to detect a meaningful trend in @xmath9 with [ fe / h ] due to the small sample sizes .",
    "at the characteristic abundance of the halo , [ fe / h ] @xmath220 1.6 , the various results shown in figure 7 cover a range of 0.20.3 mag , and appear to separate into a brighter and a fainter group .",
    "interestingly , whether a particular result is bright or faint does not seem to be a function of the method employed .",
    "for example , buonanno _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) found a bright zero - point by fitting 19 globulars to 5 subdwarfs , while csj found a faint zero - point by fitting a single cluster to the subdwarf ( of identical abundance ) with the best trigonometric parallax .",
    "similarly , using the sandage period - shift effect , sandage ( 1990b ) obtained a bright zero - point and a steep slope . using data for a different set of field stars , adopting a different effective temperature relation , and employing a different mass - metallicity relation ,",
    "csj obtained a moderate slope .",
    "fernley ( 1993 ) used infra - red rather than optical observations of field and cluster rr lyraes in his period shift analysis , and found a bright zero - point but a moderate slope .",
    "apparently , the current uncertainty in @xmath9 is dominated by differences in the details of the methods a particular author follows , and his or her choice of a particular data set or reddening correction .",
    "it is very difficult to determine which of these assumptions are correct or incorrect at this level of detail .    in deciding",
    "which methods shown in figure 7 should be given the most weight , it is worth noting several strengths of the stat-@xmath18 method .",
    "first , stat-@xmath18 is independent of other distance determinations .",
    "by contrast , cluster main sequence fitting requires precise trigonometric parallaxes to the nearby subdwarfs .",
    "calibrations of @xmath9 based on lmc distances determined by other methods are similarly complicated . for example , the cepheid calibration used by walker ( 1992 ) to obtain the lmc distance is based on main sequence fits of cepheid - bearing galactic open clusters to the pleiades , @xmath221 main sequence fits of the pleiades to local dwarfs with trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "a second strength of the stat-@xmath18 method is that it relies on a simple , extremely well - tested model .",
    "the kinematics of the galaxy are described by three mean velocities , three velocity dispersions , and the orientation of this velocity ellipsoid relative to the cardinal directions of the galaxy .",
    "countless kinematic studies over the past half century have shown this to be a very complete description of local galactic kinematics . by comparison ,",
    "the models or basic assumptions on which many of the other techniques rely are far more complex , and tend not to be so well - tested .",
    "for example , the baade - wesselink method depends on model atmospheres to determine both the surface brightness constant , @xmath222 , and the observed - to - pulsation velocity correction , @xmath223 ( jones _ et al .",
    "both the baade - wesselink and period shift methods rely on a color - index @xmath78 effective temperature relation , and different authors advocate different relations ( sandage 1990b , csj , fernley 1993 , sandage 1993 ) .",
    "the period shift method also relies heavily on the assumed rr lyrae mass - metallicity relation , yet the mass estimates from double - mode rr lyraes are in serious conflict with those derived from the baade - wesselink method , and to a lesser extent with masses derived from hb theory ( fernley 1993 , yi _",
    "meanwhile , @xmath9 estimates from hb theory are dependent on the color  temperature relation , the evolutionary models ( including the treatment of convection ) , and especially on the assumed main sequence helium abundance , @xmath224 ( lee 1990 ) .",
    "@xmath9 values derived from main sequence fits currently rely on theoretical isochrones to correct the colors and/or magnitudes of the clusters and/or field subdwarfs to a common metallicity ( buonanno _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , bolte & hogan 1995 ) .",
    "the reader is referred to the papers noted above and in table 7 for detailed discussion of these topics .",
    "our @xmath9 result for the halo is 0.06 mag brighter than the csj value at [ fe / h ] = 1.61 , and agrees better with this and other `` faint '' @xmath9 values than the `` bright '' results shown in fig .",
    "7 , which are @xmath170.2 mag brighter . given this dichotomy , it is valid to ask whether there are any parameters we could change that would push our result to a brighter value .",
    "the results of srm suggest that if we adopted the sturch ( 1966 ) reddening scale , based on the blanketing - corrected colors of rr lyraes at minimum light , we would obtain a result @xmath170.11 mag _ brighter _ than our current result .",
    "however , srm argue that the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) based redding scale is preferred .    in sec .",

    "figure 8 shows the space density of stars ( in arbitrary units ) as a function of distance through bw . using a variety of methods",

    "the difference in apparent magnitude between a cluster s rr lyraes and its msto , together with an adopted value for @xmath9 , can be used to find the absolute magnitude of the cluster s msto .",

    "the kinematic results for both the disk and halo may also be more precise than the errors cited above .",
    "however , it is outside the scope of this paper to determine which set of error values is correct .",
    "so , for the present , we have conservatively adopted the larger values .",
    "the simulations also enabled us to evaluate the effects of other factors on the solutions .",
    "all were negligible , except for a small bias towards `` short '' distance scales that is observed when the @xmath80 and @xmath68 velocity dispersions are of comparable size .",
    "we determined corrections based on the simulations : 0.15 mag for the disk and 0.04 mag for the halo solutions .",
    "the former correction was applied to the real - data solutions , while the latter was deemed too small to be of practical value .",
    "we discussed the effects of systematic errors .",
    "the main systematic uncertainty is in the adopted reddening scale .",
    "our scale ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) makes our @xmath9 value @xmath170.11 mag fainter than it would have been using the sturch ( 1966 ) reddenings , but srm argue that the former scale is preferred .",
    "our adopted photometric scale makes our quoted @xmath9 value as bright as possible ( @xmath170.07 mag ) .",
    "several other minor systematics , including the halo bias correction noted above , were also considered .",
    "it is unlikely that these systematic errors alone can account for the difference between our @xmath9 value and the brighter ( @xmath170.2 mag ) values found by some authors ( e.g. , buonanno _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; sandage 1990b , 1993 ; walker 1992 ) .    unlike the methods used by many authors ,",
    "the stat-@xmath18 method is independent of other distance calibrations .",
    "it also depends on a relatively simple and well - tested model ( galactic kinematics ) in comparison to the other methods , which employ model atmospheres , stellar evolution theory , empirical color  temperature relations , rr lyrae mass determinations , etc .",
    "we investigated the implications of our halo @xmath9 by using an @xmath9[fe / h ] relation based on an adopted slope of @xmath15[fe / h ] = 0.15 mag dex@xmath5 in combination with our halo zero - point .",
    "we found the distance to the galactic center to be @xmath268 kpc based on observations of the rr lyraes in baade s window , in good agreement with many other estimates of @xmath226 . using the `` brighter '' @xmath9 values",
    ", @xmath226 is 10% larger .",
    "following chaboyer _",
    "( 1996b ) , we found the mean age of the 17 oldest galactic globular clusters to be @xmath269 gyr , 3.4 gyr older than the mean age obtained using the brighter rr lyrae zero - point ; this places an important lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "we found the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud to be @xmath12 mag .",
    "any estimates of the hubble constant , @xmath13 , which are based on an lmc distance modulus of 18.50 mag ( e.g. , the cepheid study of ferrarese _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) increase by 10% if their distance scales are recalibrated to match our lmc distance .",
    "this increase implies a younger age for the universe , in conflict with the older globular cluster ages derived from our @xmath9 value .",
    "the conflict is lessened or eliminated if the true value of @xmath13 is low , if the cosmological constant is non - zero , or if further refinements to stellar evolution theory result in younger cluster ages .",
