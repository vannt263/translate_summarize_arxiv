    "few detections of extrasolar planets atmospheric species are reported so far , but they have been recognized as important steps in our understanding of these objects . of particular interest are the direct detections with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) during primary transits of nai by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as well as hi , oi and cii by vidal - madjar et al .  ( 2003 , 2004 ) ( hereafter vm003 and vm004 ) and ballester et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the recent paper by ben jaffel ( 2007 ) ( hereafter bj007 ) however casts some doubt on many aspects of the hi detection in the upper atmosphere of hd209458b and on the implication that the planet is evaporating due to the large energy input from its nearby host star ( e.g. , lecavelier des etangs 2007 ) .",
    "consequently , a related large number of theoretical studies would have to be revised .    in the present rebuttal paper ,",
    "we discuss the bj007 arguments and show where they are misguiding .",
    "bj007 completed a new data analysis based on sampling the same observations as vm003 in a different temporal manner , and adding data from two hst orbits from an archival program completed at another epoch ( two orbits added to the nine hst orbits of the vm003 observations ) . from the resulting new lyman  @xmath0  transit light curve , the transit absorption depth",
    "is evaluated by integrating the lyman  @xmath0  flux in two ranges  : `` blue '' ( 1214.83 - 1215.36 ) and `` red '' ( 1215.89 - 1216.43 ) .",
    "this slightly increases the wavelength domain excluded from the analysis because of geocoronal contamination , from 1215.5 - 1215.8  in vm003 to 1215.36 - 1215.89  in bj007 .",
    "this has , however , no significant consequences on the evaluation as shown in the figure  4 of vm003 .",
    "bj007 evaluates the transit depth by fitting a light curve over the observations sampled by 300s sub - exposures as a function of the planet orbital phase .",
    "the resampled observations show some level of variability mainly due to the variation of the stellar lyman  @xmath0  flux .",
    "the fitting procedure `` smooths '' these variations as if all observations were made with an average stellar lyman  @xmath0  flux .",
    "this gives an average hi absorption during the transit of ( @xmath7 by considering a wavelength range from 1214.83 to 1216.43    which corresponds to @xmath8  km / s in velocity space .",
    "the data analysis of bj007 is not put into question here .",
    "the major differences between bj007 and vm003 are on the data interpretation .",
    "both analyses provide a lyman  @xmath0  line flux as a function of time and wavelength , which includes possible stellar variations and planetary transit signature .",
    "the differences lie i ) in the wavelength ranges used to convert the spectra , as a function of time , into a single absorption depth measurement and ii ) in the reference flux used to correct for the intrinsic stellar flux variations .",
    "the lyman  @xmath0  emission of the star can significantly vary from epoch to epoch . because there is no detectable transit absorption signature in the lyman  @xmath0   line wings",
    "( the nominal 1.5% obscuration by the planetary disk is below the data s / n ) , vm003 calculated a _ relative _ absorption depth using wings of the lyman  @xmath0  line as flux reference .",
    "this method aims at correcting for any intrinsic and unknown changes in the lyman  @xmath0  stellar flux ( see   [ stellar variations ] ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lya ] , vm003 defined two spectral domains  : the line core from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( called `` in '' in vm003 and `` core '' in fig .  [",
    "fig : lya ] ; excluding the part of the spectrum contaminated by the geocoronal lyman  @xmath0  emission ) , and the remaining wavelength domain in the wings of the line used as a flux reference from 1214.4   to @xmath9 and from @xmath10 to 1216.8   ( called `` out '' in vm003 and `` wing '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : lya ] ) . the best domain defined by @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "is found by varying the positions of these two wavelengths until the strongest absorption signal is identified .",
    "vm003 found that the strongest absorption relative to the line wings takes place in the line core between @xmath9=1215.15 and @xmath10=1216.10   ( excluding the central geocoronal region ) .",
    "lccc & line core & intermediate & whole line + spectral domain & 1215.15 - 1216.10 & 1214.83 - 1216.43 & 1210 - 1220 + & vm003 limits & bj007 limits & + published absorption ( % ) & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + ( reference and data set ) & ( vm003 ) & ( bj007 ) & ( vm004 ) + absorptions using vm003 dataset@xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 +   +   +     +    because the hi absorption takes place only in the central part of the lyman  @xmath0  line , the absorption depth measurement must decrease for increasing wavelength range , including wings of the line where there is no absorption .",
    "this has already been found by vm004 with an independent data set obtained with stis in the g140l low resolution mode . in the low resolution data ,",
    "the lyman  @xmath0  stellar emission line is not spectrally resolved and only the total lyman  @xmath0  flux can be evaluated .",
    "vm004 obtained a @xmath18 transit absorption depth over the whole line , in agreement with the estimate obtained from the vm003 dataset ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .    to compare the vm003 result to that of bj007",
    ", we can also calculate the transit absorption depth over the spectral domain as defined by bj007 using the spectra of vm003 . keeping the same approach as in vm003 to account for stellar lyman  @xmath0  variations ,",
    "we evaluate the planetary absorption during transit using the line wings as flux reference . we find a mid - transit absorption of ( 7.3@xmath52.0)% over the same spectral region used by bj007 , which is in agreement with the bj007 result of 8.9% considering that the data set is the same , except for the addition of two hst orbits to the nine used by vm003 .",
    "this result shows that , considering the same wavelength range , similar transit absorption depths are found in the vm003 and bj007 spectra ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty and noise appear to be lower in bj007 than in vm003 .",
    "the difference is explained by the larger wavelength range used by bj007 to estimate the lyman  @xmath0  flux and by the uncertainty introduced by the correction of the lyman  @xmath0  variations applied by vm003 ( see   [ stellar variations ] ) .    in short ,",
    "the results given in vm003 and bj007 for lyman  @xmath0  absorption depths can be reconciled .",
    "the apparent difference is basically due to the width of the spectral domain over which the absorption is computed , acknowledging that the hi absorption does not cover the whole extent of the stellar lyman  @xmath0  line .",
    "when using a larger wavelength domain , the absorption signal is diluted and the absorption depth measurement is lower , as found in bj007 compared to vm003 , and in vm004 compared to bj007 .",
    "another argument , made by bj007 against the evaporation scenario , is that the blue - shifted absorption ( produced by hydrogen atoms at speeds up to @xmath2km / s identified by vm003 ) is not confirmed in the bj007 analysis .",
    "velocities of @xmath2km / s are above the escape velocity of about @xmath1942km / s ( at 1  @xmath20 ) .",
    "if observed , high velocity atoms must be escaping the planet .",
    "following the same approach as above using the vm003 dataset , we evaluate the absorption seen during transit within the `` blue '' and the `` red '' sides of the wavelength domain defined by bj007 . in this domain ,",
    "we find ( 9.8@xmath51.8)%  and ( 5.2@xmath51.0)%  absorption in the `` blue '' and the `` red '' sides , respectively .",
    "therefore , the large spectral domain defined by bj007 ( including velocities up to @xmath21km / s ) shows a significant absorption in both blue and red sides with , as found in vm003 , an absorption stronger in the blue than in the red .    finally ,",
    "although very little work has been published to explain these high velocities , they can be produced by radiation pressure from the intense lyman-@xmath0 flux of the nearby star ( see the velocity diagram and the cometary shape of the escaping atoms in fig .  3 of vidal - madjar & lecavelier des etangs ( 2004 ) ) . in which case ,",
    "a difference between blue and red absorptions is expected .",
    "in previous works , corrections for stellar variations was done either using the wings of the line ( vm003 ) or the observations before and after the transit ( vm004 ) , while bj007 correction was done by averaging the flux variations by fitting a standard transit curve over the phase - folded data points ( see fig .  2 in bj007 ) .",
    "contrary to the claim made by bj007 , the lyman  @xmath0  variations of hd209458 are not necessarily relatively large but normal for a quiet solar type star ( vidal - madjar , 1975 ) .",
    "in fact , when data are phase - folded , the apparent variations can be artificially enhanced due to the superimposition of observations made at different dates . moreover ,",
    "real stellar fluctuations are combined with significant noise which is expected to be large because of the limited number of photons in the short temporal bins .",
    "the sun can be used as a proxy to study the possible variations of the flux and shape of the hd209458 lyman  @xmath0  line .",
    "hd209458 is a solar type star ( g0v ) whose similarity with the sun is demonstrated by the observation of the chromospheric caii line profiles , which are relatively quiet for both stars . from observations obtained with soho ( solar and heliocentric observatory , lemaire et al . , 2002 ) , we show that the core - to - wing ratio of the solar lyman  @xmath0  line varies by about @xmath22 , while it varies by about @xmath23 for a given total lyman  @xmath0  flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sun_var ] ) .",
    "hd209458 is expected to have the same behavior and the 15%   transit measurements is unlikely to be due to stellar variations .",
    "this is strengthened by the hd209458 lyman  @xmath0  measurements which present two different groups of core - to - wing flux ratios ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sun_var ] ) : the ratios measured before the transit and the ratios during the planetary transit .",
    "although these measurements are obtained at various epochs , the dispersion within a given group is small and within the error bars , while the difference between the measurements taken during the transit compared to the reference measurements taken before the transit is significant and larger than variations observed in the sun .",
    "this behavior is unlikely to be coincidental and corresponds to the expected signal for a cloud of hi atoms in the environment of hd209458b .",
    "moreover , the dispersion of these individual measurements shows no correlation with the total lyman  @xmath0  flux .",
    "this shows that the stellar variations are unlikely to be responsible for the observed lyman  @xmath0  core - to - wings variations .",
    "the core - to wing variations are thus more likely related to the planetary transit .",
    "finally , it is extremely unlikely that stellar variations can mimic a transit light curve as seen in fig .  2 of bj007 , when measurements are phase - folded with the planetary orbital ephemerides .    in summary ,",
    "the stellar variations are taken into account by vm003 by comparing the variations in the core to the variations in the wings of the line , and by bj007 by averaging a smooth transit light curve over a fluctuating lyman  @xmath0stellar flux .",
    "the similarity of the resulting absorption depths , using the bj007 and vm003 dataset , when evaluated over the same spectral domain ( table  1 ) shows that the lyman  @xmath0  stellar variability does not corrupt the transit evaluation whatever the approach used for the data analysis .",
    "bj007 compares the @xmath24 absorption depth derived in his work to the absorption caused by an occulting disk with a size of @xmath25 r@xmath26 supposed to be the size of the roche lobe as calculated using equations found in gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the case of hd209458b ,",
    "a disk with a radius of @xmath25 r@xmath26 corresponds to an absorption depth of about 25@xmath27 during transit .",
    "bj007 thus concludes that the observed hydrogen atoms are inside the roche lobe and can not escape the planet .",
    "first , as discussed above , the bj007 evaluation of @xmath28 is only a fraction of the full hi absorption depth in the line core .",
    "second , the formula of gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for computing the roche lobe corresponds to the lagrangian point l1 between the star and the planet , i.e. the most distant roche limit position relative to the planet ( see eq .  b.8 and discussion in lecavelier des etangs , 2007 ) .",
    "however , the roche lobe around the planet is not spherical but elongated toward the star ( see e.g. lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "in a transit configuration , the observed limit of the roche lobe is in a direction perpendicular to the star - planet direction . in this perpendicular direction ,",
    "the roche lobe extension is about 2/3 of the extension toward the l1 point .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to use an average distance to the roche lobe , which was given by vm003 to be @xmath29 r@xmath26 ( paczynski , 1971 ) .",
    "a filled roche lobe corresponds to about 12%  absorption .",
    "this value is comparable to the hi observation of @xmath30 absorption depth in the line core .",
    "we can conclude that hi atoms reach the roche lobe or beyond , in agreement with the models of atmospheric escape .",
    "in addition , although observation of hydrogen atoms outside the roche lobe is a direct evidence for escape , it is not a necessary condition . even filling - up half a roche lobe would imply escape rates large enough to significantly affect atmospheric structure ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "thus , whether the hydrogen cloud actually fills up the roche lobe or not , the large extension of the upper atmosphere ( and possibly a cometary shape due to radiation pressure ) shows that the atmosphere is indeed escaping .",
    "we have demonstrated that the bj007 analysis is in agreement with hi escape from the hd209458b atmosphere . even if one considers that the absorption value given by bj007 is correct , then either : i ) this @xmath199%  absorption depth is taking place over the whole spectral range of @xmath31km / s , or ii ) the @xmath199%  absorption is the result of an unresolved larger absorption within a narrower wavelength range , produced by atoms below the escape velocity of about @xmath32km / s . in the first case ,",
    "hi atoms are detected to move at velocities much larger than the escape velocity . in the second case",
    ", the absorption takes place over a narrow spectral range , @xmath195 times narrower than the range considered in bj007 . in this narrow wavelength range",
    ", the absorption must be @xmath3312%   and hi atoms must be present beyond the roche lobe . in both alternatives , the result of the data analysis described in bj007 shows that hi must be escaping the planet atmosphere .",
    "bj007 called into question the vm003 discovery of the atmospheric escape from the hd209458b extrasolar planet .",
    "bj007 gives two main arguments  : i ) the absorption depth is smaller than previously estimated and the roche limit is not reached , and ii ) the data analysis is corrupted by intrinsic stellar lyman  @xmath0  variations .",
    "the first argument is not correct because the absorption is not taking place over the whole lyman  @xmath0  line .",
    "the absorption depth measurements depend on the considered wavelength range .",
    "in addition , the roche lobe shape and orientation must be taken into account when comparing the size corresponding to these absorption depths with the size of the roche lobe .",
    "the second objection is rejected by recalling that vm003 corrected for the stellar variations using the overall stability of the line shape and the line wings as flux reference .    finally , despite the affirmation in the introduction of bj007 ,",
    "works to transpose these observations into estimates of escape rate have been made early in vm003 and recently in schneiter et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as stated by our anonymous referee , these `` observational '' estimates agree with the most recent and sophisticated models which all find rather good agreement with mass loss rates of @xmath34  gs@xmath35 . therefore , at the orbital distance of hd209458b , atmospheric escape does not strongly affect the evolution of the planets , in accord with the evolutionary studies .",
    "last , but not least , ben jaffel ( 2007 ) performed an independent , thorough and careful analysis of the best available data set for measuring the lyman  @xmath0  transit absorption depth . despite a misinterpretation of the resulting spectra , this work confirms that the signal detected in vm003 is indeed present and is not related to the data reduction process .",
    "therefore , in the atmosphere of hd209458b , hi appears to be the only species to have been detected with two independent datasets , and now with independent data analyses .",
    "the bj007 data analysis strengthens the detection of the extended escaping atmosphere of hd209458b , in agreement with numerous theoretical studies of this phenomenon ( e.g. , lammer et al .",
    "2003 ; lecavelier des etangs et al . 2004 ; yelle 2004 , 2006 ; baraffe et al . 2005 ; tian et al . 2005 ; garcia - munoz 2006 ) .",
