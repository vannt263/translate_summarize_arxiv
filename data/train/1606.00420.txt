    "characterizing the quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is of central significance to both condensed matter physics and quantum information science .",
    "exactly solvable quantum many - body models are benefit to demonstrate the concept and characteristic of qpts .",
    "recently , topological phases and phase transitions @xcite have attracted much attention in various physical contexts . in general , qpts are classified two types , characterized by topologically nontrivial properties in the hilbert space , and by the local order parameters associated with symmetry breaking sachdev , respectively .",
    "both conventional and topological qpts refer tothe sudden change of the groundstate properties driven by the change of external parameters .",
    "a  topological qpt involves the change of ground - state topological properties which are indicated by topological quantum discrete numbers @xcite , while the various phases in a conventional qpt are distinguished by continuously varying order parameters .",
    "the topological quantum number is topological invariant , such as chern number and  majorana zero mode , which  have been received much recent interest wilczek , moore , nayak , ivanov , kitaev , fu , alicea , oreg , roy , sen , niu , chen1,chen2 .",
    "nevertheless , so far there are no evidences to suggest that the two types of qpts are absolutely incompatible , not occur at the same point for certain systems .",
    "an interesting question is whether the local order parameter and topological order parameter can coexist to characterize the quantum phase transitions . in recent work @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the variation of the groundstate energy density for a class of exactly solvable quantum ising models , which is a function of a loop in a two - dimensional auxiliary space , experiences a nonanalytical point when the winding number of the corresponding loop changes .",
    "this fact indicates that this class of models can be joint ones in which a topological and a conventional qpts occur simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate topological properties in a family of exactly solvable ising models with short- and long - range interactions .",
    "we introduce the concept of majorana charge to indicate the phase diagram based on the corresponding majorana tight - binding lattice with open boundary condition .",
    "the magnitude of majorana charge is determined by the distribution of majorana fermion probability in zero - mode states , while its sign is determined by the types of majorana fermions .",
    "we show that the topological invariants , the chern numbers of a corresponding bloch band equal to the winding number in the auxiliary plane . furthermore by direct calculations of the majorana modes we analytically and numerically verify that the majorana charge is equal to chern numbers and winding numbers .",
    "these indicate that three quantities can equally characterize the phase diagram in quantum spin systems .",
