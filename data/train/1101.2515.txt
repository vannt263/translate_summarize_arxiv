    "while the dark matter provides the necessary gravitational field to account for the observation , its composition remains unknown , probably consisting of particles not included in the standard model .",
    "the origin of the dark - matter problem is the measurement of the tangential velocity @xmath3 of stable circular orbits of hydrogen clouds in the outer regions of the halo .",
    "the observed constant velocity can only be explained by assuming that the energy density decreases with the distance as @xmath4 so that the increase in the mass of galaxies is proportional to the distance @xmath5 from the center .    of the many proposed candidates for dark matter , the most favored is the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) paradigm @xcite . another favorite is the @xmath6 cdm model that is related to the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . for a summary of some alternative theories such as scalar - tensor and brane - world models , see rahaman et al .",

    "we propose a new model based on a combination of a quintessence - like field and a field with ( possibly ) anisotropic pressure , representing normal matter .",
    "we study conditions leading to stable circular orbits and attractive gravity , as well as the observed equation of state of the galactic halo , based on a combination of rotation curves and lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "the conditions required for stable orbits and attractive gravity are rather stringent , but by comparing global and local effects , they proved to be consistent with earlier results obtained by guzman et al .",
    "in this paper the metric for a static spherically symmetric spacetime is taken as @xmath11 where the functions of the radial coordinate @xmath5,@xmath12 and @xmath13 , are the metric potentials .",
    "now we consider a model which contains a quintessence field and a second field with an anisotropic pressure representing normal matter . here",
