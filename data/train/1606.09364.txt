    "<S> fluorescence light is collected in a spectral window from to blocking the contributions from scattered laser light at both excitation wavelengths .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample investigated were prepared as follows : a native oxide si ( 100 ) substrate was cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone , isopropanol , and ethanol . before drop - casting of ethanol solution containing pristine h - bn flakes ( graphene supermarket ) of approximately onto silicon substrates . </S>",

    "<S> the defects lie in the materials band gap of @xmath3  @xcite and can be exited in the excited state @xmath1 using one or two photons before they decay to the ground state @xmath0 under emission of a photon .        </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : spectra](a ) shows the spectrum of this emitter using pulsed wavelength excitation . </S>",

    "<S> again , a clear peak is visible . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum around the peak differs slightly between ( a ) and ( b ) , what is attributed to excitations in the surrounding material , which are different when using different excitation wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the emission corresponds to an isolated defect embedded in a hbn lattice , in accordance to previous results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : spectra](c ) and ( d ) show intensity autocorrelation measurements of the photons from the defect with pulsed red and cw and pulsed green excitation , respectively . in these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the bandpass filter was employed in order to suppress background photons . </S>",
    "<S> excitation power was in ( c ) , what corresponds to approximately twice the saturation power @xmath4 ( see figure  [ fig : powerdependence ] and equation  [ eq : tp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> all excitation powers are measured before the beam enters the microscope objective . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements confirm that the addressed defect is a true single photon emitter . </S>",
    "<S> the complete absence of a peak in the coincidences at zero time delay for pulsed green excitation in the upper part of ( d ) indicates the purity of the emitter . from this measurement , also the excited state lifetime of the emitter </S>",
    "<S> is extracted to be . </S>",
    "<S> the cw green excitation measurement is taken in the saturated regime at an excitation power of . </S>",
    "<S> besides the antibunching dip ( with a depth limited by our detectors timing resolution ) , it shows a pronounced bunching behaviour , which indicates the presence of a metastable state  @xcite . using pulsed red excitation , also in the saturated regime ( see figure  [ fig : spectra](c ) ) this behaviour is not visible , an indication that due to different excitation wavelengths different levels in the defect are addressed that are not included in the simplified level scheme in figure  [ fig : setup](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> one possible explanation to this is , that the shelving state present gets depopulated by the red laser in a kind of re - pumping process  @xcite .    in order to get a better understanding of the defect and to proof that indeed two - photon excitation is the dominant excitation process using wavelength pulsed light , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the number of photons emitted on the excitation power was measured . for a one - photon process , ( denoted by subscript 1 ) this dependence follows  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the photon emission ate , @xmath7 is the excitation intensity , @xmath8 is the saturation intensity , and @xmath9 is the maximum photon emission rate . for a two - photon process ( denoted by subscript 2 ) , where the dependence on intensity is quadratic , the number of emitted photons follows : @xmath10     * b * , same as * a * , but using wavelength cw excitation light . </S>",
    "<S> the line is a fit to equation  [ eq : op ] * c * and * d * , double logarithmic plots of the data in * a * and * b * , respectively . note the different sloped for low excitation powers . </S>",
    "<S> integration for each data point was . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : powerdependence ] . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : powerdependence](a ) and ( c ) , the measurements using wavelength pulsed light are shown on a linear and double logarithmic scale , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to equation  [ eq : tp ] ( drawn through line ) yields @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : powerdependence](b ) and ( d ) , the measurements using wavelength cw light are shown on a linear and double logarithmic scale , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to equation  [ eq : op ] ( drawn through line ) yields @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> all fits were performed using a least squares algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> while these measurements proof the two - photon excitation using the red laser , there is a large difference in the maximum count rate @xmath15 between the different modes of excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this difference of over one magnitude can not be explained by different setup configuration or due to chromatic aberrations since the emitted photons have the same wavelength in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> bad alignment of the excitation hence would only influence @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as in the antibunching measurements , we assume that there are additional states present , which get populated differently depending on the excitation mode . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the emitter is brighter under green excitation , what is the opposite one would expect if it gets de - shelved by the red laser . </S>",
    "<S> this is a indication that the defects in hbn possess a complicated level structure . </S>",
    "<S> further evaluation of the level structure lies beyond the scope of this paper , but we want to point out that this makes defects in hbn highly interesting for applications in quantum optics , where it is highly desired to have the possibility to address different levels .     under pulsed red excitation . </S>",
    "<S> many lines are visible on a broad background . </S>",
    "<S> * b * , corresponding second order autocorrelation measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at zero time delay is considerably reduced proofing the non - classicality of the light emitted . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly shows that even in a small scan area as in figure  [ fig : scans ] many quantum emitters capable of two - photon excitation can be found . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fourth](a ) shows the spectrum of the defect labelled 2 in figure  [ fig : scans ] under pulsed red excitation . on a broad background , </S>",
    "<S> there are many lines visible . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from this , in the second order autocorrelation function shown in figure  [ fig : fourth](b ) the peak at zero is still present , yet reduced , what means that more than one emitter contributes to the signal measured . </S>",
    "<S> this shows , that even on a small scan as the scan in figure  [ fig : scans ] many quantum emitters can be seen . </S>",
    "<S> while many single emitters are observed using single photon ( green ) excitation , that is not necessarily the case for two - photon excitation . due to the high excitation powers used for two - photon measurements , stability of the defects </S>",
    "<S> becomes an issue . </S>",
    "<S> while some emitters , as emitter 1 , were long term stable , many others got destroyed by the laser . </S>",
    "<S> one way to solve this in future experiments would be to use a laser pulse shorter than the one of used here , what will reduce thermal load on the emitters considerably . nevertheless , as shown in figure  [ fig : fourth ] , it is possible to find more emitters that behave non - classically .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated two - photon excitation of single quantum emitters in two - dimensional hexagonal boron nitride . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such a measurement has successfully performed on a two - dimensional material or a single defect in general . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the capabilities of two - dimensional materials for potential use as small and stable bio - markers operating in the biological window wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> our findings achieved under different excitation conditions give first insights in the defects level structure , what is a prerequisite on the way to non - linear quantum photonics . </S>"
