    "understanding the origin of hierarchical fermion masses and mixing angles is one of most important issues in particle physics .",

    "recently new ideas related to extra dimensions have also been discussed .    in models with softly - broken supersymmetry ( susy ) ,",
    "a mechanism that generates the hierarchical structure of yukawa couplings generally affects the sfermion sector ; one would have a characteristic pattern of sfermion masses and susy - breaking trilinear couplings .",
    "for example , the froggatt - nielsen mechanism with an extra @xmath5 gauge symmetry leads to the so - called @xmath6-term contribution to soft scalar masses ,- term contributions through gut breaking and ref .",
    "@xcite for anomalous @xmath5 breaking.]which are proportional to the charges under the broken @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "such a pattern could be tested if superpartners will be discovered and sfermion masses as well as trilinear scalar couplings will be measured in future experiments . even at present ,",
    "soft susy - breaking parameters are constrained rather severely from the exprimental bounds on flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes as well as cp violation .",
    "this is the susy flavor problem .",
    "for instance , the flavor - dependent @xmath6-term contributions are generically dangerous . in general",
    ", the susy flavor problem can be solved if either of the following three is realized at least for the first two families ; 1 )  diagonal and degenerate sfermion masses , 2 )  decoupling of heavy sfermions , and 3 )  the alignment between the fermion and sfermion bases .",
    "much effort has been devoted to realize the first solution by seeking a flavor - blind mediation mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "nelson and strassler  @xcite have recently proposed an interesting mechanism to realize hierarchical yukawa couplings .",
    "the setup is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , or its extention , coupled to superconformal ( sc ) sector .",
    "the sc sector is strongly coupled and assumed to have an infrared ( ir ) fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the first and second families of quarks and leptons gain a large and positive anomalous dimensions through the sc dynamics .",
    "then their yukawa couplings to electroweak higgs fields are suppressed hierarchically at the scale @xmath7 where the sc sector is assumed to decouple from the mssm sector .",
    "the sc fixed point has more interesting consequences .",
    "when pure superconformal field theory ( scft ) is perturbed by soft susy - breaking terms , general argument shows that such perturbation is exponentially suppressed toward the sc fixed point  @xcite .",
    "specifically one expects that a sfermion mass is suppressed at the decoupling scale @xmath7 and eventually receives radiative corrections governed by the sm gaugino masses , which are flavor - blind .",
    "hence , we would have degenerate mass spectrum of sfermions like the ` no - scale ' model ( at least for the first two families ) .",
    "this possibility has already been mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "soft scalar masses are to be controlled by the flavor mechanism that generates hierarchical yukawa couplings , no matter how susy breaking is mediated and no matter what initial conditions of soft susy - breaking terms are .",
    "this approach , which we shall pursue in this paper , is quite opposite to the usual scenario in which degenerate soft scalar masses are supposed to be derived by a flavor - blind mediation of susy breaking .",
    "when the pure scft is perturbed by the sm gauge interactions and the sm gaugino masses , each sfermion mass is not completely suppressed , but converges on a flavor - dependent value  @xcite .",
    "the convergent value is one - loop suppressed since the sm gauge couplings are perturbatively small .",
    "it is then plausible that sfermion masses at the weak scale may be calculated solely in terms of the sm gauge coupling constants and gaugino masses .",
    "in fact , under some assumptions , we can estimate the degeneracy factor @xmath8 of sfermion masses up to a single model - dependent parameter @xmath9",
    "it was found that for @xmath10  gev , the degeneracy factor is @xmath11 for squarks and @xmath12 for sleptons . in particular , the right - handed sleptons are not well degenerate in mass . note that these degeneracy factors are evaluated in the sfermion basis .    in this paper , we first examine the assumptions that are implicit in the estimation of sfermion mass degeneracy in the present scft approach .",
    "we also discuss to what extent the degeneracy is required in the nelson - strassler scenario . to this aim",
    ", we take into account the fact that fcnc processes , when correctly evaluated in the fermion basis , have additional suppression since the nelson - strassler mechanism leads to hierarchical yukawa matrices .",
    "it is natural to extend the analysis to grand unified theories ( guts ) and to examine how much degeneracy of sfermion masses is achieved by coupling to scfts .",
    "that is our second purpose ; we explicitly study sfermion mass degeneracy within the framework of guts coupled to sc sectors .",
    "we take the @xmath0 and the flipped @xmath13 as a prototype of gut models .",
    "we shall show how much degeneracy of sfermion masses is expected in each case .",
    "it turns out that a simple extention of the mssm to the @xmath0 makes the degeneracy of the right - handed sleptons worse , because each right - handed lepton is embedded into a higher - dimensional representation .",
    "the situation is different in the flipped @xmath13 case , since the right - handed leptons remain @xmath0-singlets  @xcite , and the bino mass @xmath2 is determined by a combination of two independent gaugino masses of @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a brief review on the nelson - strassler mechanism in section  [ subsec : yukawa ] , we outline in subsection  [ subsec : mass ] the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on degeneracy of sfermion masses in the sfermion basis within the framework of the mssm coupled to sc sectors .",
    "we also discuss under what conditions the degeneracy factor can be estimated in a simple mannar .",
    "the fcnc constraints are examined in subsection  [ subsec : fcnc ] by taking into account yukawa - diagonalizing matrices . in sections  [ sec :",
    "gg ] and [ sec : flipped ] , we extend the model to guts and investigate generic features .",
    "specifically we argue that the degeneracy of the right - handed sleptons becomes worse in @xmath0 models than the mssm .",
    "we then show how the degeneracy for the right - handed sleptons can be improved in the flipped @xmath13 models . in section",
    "[ sec : threshold ] , we briefly discuss various sorts of threshold effects , which might affect the previous results .",
    "this in particular includes @xmath6-term contributions on sfermion masses in the flipped @xmath13 models .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "we note that luty and sundrum  @xcite discuss a scenario of ` conformal sequestering , ' which is another interesting approach to the susy flavor problem based on four - dimensional scfts .",
    "although closely related to the present scft approach , it is slightly different in that the scft couples to messenger fields of susy breaking , not to quarks and leptons .",
    "here we give a brief review on the nelson - strassler ( ns ) mechanism that generates the hierarchical structure of yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "we assume two sectors : one is the sm sector and the other is the sc sector .",
    "the sm sector has the gauge group @xmath15 , or its extention , and contains three families of quarks and leptons @xmath16 @xmath17 as well as higgs fields @xmath18 .",
    "the sc sector has a gauge group @xmath19 and matter fields @xmath20 .",
    "the fields @xmath16 and @xmath18 are taken to be @xmath19-singlets .",
    "the following superpotential is assumed ; @xmath21 where the first term describes the ordinary yukawa couplings in the sm sector and the ellipsis denotes terms including only @xmath20 .",
    "the second term represents the couplings of quarks and leptons @xmath16 to the sc sector , which we refer to as _ messenger couplings_. for the messenger coupling @xmath22 to be allowd by gauge invariance , either of @xmath20 or @xmath23 should belong to a nontrivial representation under the sm gauge group .    with sufficiently many matter fields ,",
    "the @xmath19 gauge theory resides in ` conformal window ' ; the sc gauge coupling @xmath24 has an ir fixed point  @xcite .",
    "suppose that the messenger couplings @xmath22 as well as @xmath24 approach ir fixed points .",
    "at this new fixed point , the field @xmath16 gains a large anomalous dimension @xmath25 through superconformal dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the yukawa couplings in the sm sector obey the power law and behave roughly like @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the cut - off scale , at which @xmath28 is expected .",
    "thus the hierarchical structure of yukawa couplings can be generated by family - dependent anomalous dimensions @xmath29 .",
    "the resultant yukawa matrices are similar to the ones obtained by the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism ; large anomalous dimension in the ns mechanism corresponds to @xmath5 charge in the fn mechanism . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the unitarity of the scft guarantees that the anomalous dimensions @xmath29 at the sc fixed point are always non - negative , whereas the non - negativity of @xmath5 charges is just the assumption in the conventional fn mechanism .",
    "since the top yukawa coupling should not be suppressed , the top quark as well as the up - type higgs field must not couple to the sc sector .",
    "although the bottom quark and tau lepton as well as the down - type higgs could couple , we will mainly consider , in what follows , the models in which only the first two families couple to the sc sector .",
    "next we outline , following ref .",
    "@xcite , how convergent values of soft scalar masses and sfermion mass degeneracy can be esitmated .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "we also discuss some subtleties about such estimation .",
    "the suppression of sfermion masses in the scft approach follows from a general property of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of soft susy - breaking parameters  @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate for a moment on the diagonal elements @xmath30 of a sfermion mass - squared matrix ( in a flavor basis in which fermion yukawa matrix takes the form ( [ yukawa ] ) ) .",
    "near an ir attractive fixed point of pure scft , the rge of @xmath31 takes the form @xmath32 where the coefficient matrix @xmath33 encodes full effects of the sc dynamics , and can be calculated by use of the ` grassmanian expansion method ' if the anomalous dimension @xmath34 is known as a function of coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "this matrix is positive - definite ( non - negative ) since the fixed point is ir attractive .",
    "it follows that certain combinations of @xmath31 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "moreover , _ each _",
    "@xmath30 is suppressed if its anomalous dimension @xmath29 is uniquely determined  @xcite by fixed point equations @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that in each model considered below , there exists a proper set of couplings that satisfies this condition .",
    "when we switch on the gauge couplings @xmath36 and gaugino masses @xmath37 in the sm sector ( @xmath38 ) , the rge ( [ rge : pure ] ) gets modified , at the leading order , into @xmath39 where @xmath40 with the quadratic casimir coefficient @xmath41 of the @xmath42 representation , and we have neglected for simplicity a possible contribution from the @xmath43 fayet - ilipoulos term @xmath44 .",
    "( [ rg - scalar - m ] ) implies that each sfermion mass eventually converges on one - loop suppressed value of the order @xmath45 .",
    "the convergent values generally depend on detailed structure of the sc sector , since the above rges are coupled equations for soft scalar masses in the sc sector as well as those of squarks and sleptons .",
    "we are interested in the convergent value of squark and slepton masses at the scale @xmath7 where the sc sector decouples .",
    "let @xmath46 denote soft scalar mass of the @xmath47-th family of squark or slepton @xmath48 .",
    "then the convergent value of @xmath49 at @xmath7 can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath50 in this expression , @xmath51 is the casimar factor for @xmath52 , and the prefactor @xmath53 summarizes the structure of the sc sector .",
    "typically , we find @xmath54 for squarks and sleptons . if @xmath29 and @xmath55 are different from each other , the factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 are also different .",
    "only the prefactor @xmath53 has flavor - dependency .",
    "consequently , the difference between the first and second families is given by @xmath58 which is also one - loop suppressed compared with @xmath59 .",
    "we have considered only the diagonal elements of sfermion mass - squared matrix . however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for pure scft , off - diagonal elements are also exponentially suppressed .",
    "even when we switch on sm effects , the rges of off - diagonal elements , unlike eq .",
    "( [ rg - scalar - m ] ) , contain no contribution from the sm gaugino masses at the leading order .",
    "thus the off - diagonal elements converge on sufficiently small values , which we can safely neglect .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , sfermion mass degeneracy was examined by assuming the mssm field content below @xmath7 .",
    "here let us recall some results for later convenience .",
    "the sfermion mass receives radiative correction @xmath60 between @xmath7 and @xmath61 , which is evaluated to be @xmath62 i_a(m_z , m_c ) & \\!\\equiv\\ ! &        1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2_a(m_z)}{\\alpha^2_a(m_c ) } \\ , \\qquad a_{fa } \\equiv \\frac{c_{fa}}{2b_a } \\",

    "these radiative corrections are much larger than the convergent value @xmath65 .",
    "it follows that @xmath66 where we define the degeneracy factor @xmath8 by @xmath67 the factor @xmath8 serves as an estimate of how much degeneracy of sfermion masses is achieved in the present framework .",
    "moreover , it is a calculable quantity independently of detailed structure of the sc sector , especially when the sm gaugino masses satisfy the ` gut ' relation , @xmath68 constant for @xmath38 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath69  gev gives  @xcite @xmath70 unfortunately , the degeneracy factor @xmath71 for the right - handed slepton is rather large .",
    "the primary reason is that the radiative correction to the right - handed sleton mass , which involves only @xmath2 , is smaller than the others .",
    "for the right - handed sleptons can be somewhat reduced  @xcite if there is a sizable contribution from the @xmath43 fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath72 ( with a suitable sign ) .",
    "note that we generally expect @xmath73 since soft scalar masses of the third family and higgs fields are not constrained by sc dynamics .",
    "] however , this result does not necessarily imply that the present scft approach to yukawa hierarchy leads to significant lepton flavor - violation , because the actual size of lepton flavor - violating processes depends on an explicit form of lepton yukawa matrix , as we discuss below .",

    "@xcite , the mass parameter @xmath7 should be extended to a background ( non - dynamical ) superfield , and its @xmath136-term will affect soft terms .",
    "one then expects that there arise sc threshold effects such that after the decoupling , sfermion masses are precisely anomaly - mediated one calculated in the mssm framework .",
    "thus the sc threshold effects are calculable in this case , although they are of no interest because of tachyonic sleptons .",
    "note that the latter sfermion masses and the expected convergent values are of the same order of magnitudes , @xmath137 .",
    "there is an interesting puzzle here .",
    "originally we are interested in the scft approach because it can provide degenerate sfermion spectrum no matter how susy is mediated ; if we consider rg flows of each sfermion mass corresponding to various initial conditions at the cut - off scale , all the flows converge on a certain value thanks to the sc dynamics .",
    "such rg flows would contain a special flow corresponding to anomaly - mediated spectrum .",
    "now , suppose that susy breaking is mediated _ not _",
    "purely by anomaly mediation . nevertheless , the above convergence property of rg flows would imply that the sfermion spectrum at the decoupling scale , and thus sc threshold effects , be almost the same as anomaly - mediated one .",
    "specifically the mssm coupled to sc sector would always lead to tachyonic sleptons no matter how susy is initially mediated .",
    "the resolution of this apparent puzzle is that the convergent value of each sfermion mass @xmath138 is independent of the initial conditions for @xmath138 , but does depend on the sm gaugino masses . therefore sfermion mass spectrum can be different from anomaly - mediated one , provided that the sm gaugino masses are different .    at any rate ,",
    "a lesson is that sc threshold effects would do affect sfermion masses , but their size would be at most comparable to the convergent values used in the previous sections .",
    "therefore we do not expect that our results would be modified substantially .",
    "it is interesting to confirm this expectation by explicit calculations .",
    "we have studied sfermion mass degeneracy within the framework of guts coupled to sc sectors . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath80 for the right - handed sleptons becomes worse than in the mssm .",
    "the reason is that the right - handed lepton @xmath95 is embedded into @xmath139-dimensional representation and the convergent mass value is enlarged .",
    "models with larger gauge group like @xmath129 and @xmath140 will have the same feature , as long as the sc sector decouples at the scale larger than the gut breaking scale .",

    ", we have assumed that the convergent value of sfermion masses at the decoupling scale is dominately determined by the sm one - loop terms in the rges .",
    "this assumption is plausible for the @xmath0 case , but is crucial especially for the right - handed sleptons in the mssm and the flipped model .",

    "we have also assumed that our estimation is not substantially modified by sc threshold effects .",

    "in particular , the flipped @xmath1 model requires that the tau neutrino yukawa coupling is as large as the top yukawa coupling .",
    "in general , the large mixings in lepton sector induce a significant flavor violation @xmath144 through the radiative corrections above the mass scale @xmath145 of the right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , and that constrains sfermion mass spectrum and/or requires a specific form of yukawa matrices . from this viewpoint",

    "we need further study concerning neutrino yukawa couplings .    in models with a product gauge group like @xmath13",
    ", the degeneracy can be improved if the gaugino masses do not satisfy the usual gut relation so that the convergent value of sfermion mass is much suppressed compared with the radiative corrections in the mssm regime .",
    "the @xmath147 models  @xcite will have a similar property .",
    "we speculate that even with a simple gauge group @xmath0 , such a suppression of the convergent value could be realized if one supposes that the @xmath0 gauge multiplets live in an extra - dimensional space - times . in this setup",
    ", the power - law evolution of gauge coupling and gaugino mass  @xcite makes them drastically small above @xmath120 ( in such a way that @xmath148 is still rg invariant  @xcite ) provided that the gauge coupling is asymptotically free . consequently the degeneracy would be improved if @xmath7 is taken as the energy scale where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are very small . to keep our rg calculations reliable in the sc regime ,",
    "quarks and leptons as well as sc - sector fields are supposed to live in four dimensions .",
    "such a setup could also explain why our gauge coupling @xmath149 is smaller than that in the sc sector , thanks to extra - dimensional volume suppression .",
    "the nelson - strassler scenario , which we have focused in this paper , assumes that anomalous dimensions of quarks and leptons take flavor - dependent values at the sc fixed point .",
    "the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath55 leads to hierarchical yukawa matrices , but at the same time , the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath151 leads to a distinctive non - degeneracy of sfermion masses .",
    "in the ` yukawa hierarchy transfer ' scenario  @xcite , the sc dynamics is supposed to be flavor - blind at the fixed point , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , ensuring complete degeneracy of sfermion masses .",
    "the hierarchy among yukawa couplings @xmath154 is derived by assuming the inverse hierarchy in the _ messenger _",
    "couplings @xmath22 at the cut - off scale and by _ transferring _ the initial hierarchy through the sc dynamics .",
    "moreover , the assumed hierarchy can be derived , , through the fn mechanism in the sc sector _ without _ spoiling the sfermion degeneracy by family - dependent @xmath6-term contributions .",
    "this new scenario provides an alternative way of realizing degenerate sfermion spectrum and hierarchical yukawa matrices at the same time .",
