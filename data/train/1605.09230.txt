    "the accurate delivery of various cargoes is of great importance for maintaining the correct function of cells and organisms .",

    "cells are equipped with a complex filament network and specialized motor proteins .",
    "the cytoskeleton serves as tracks for molecular motors .",
    "they convert the energy provided by atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) hydrolysis into active motion along the cytoskeletal filaments , while they simultaneously bind to cargo @xcite .",
    "in addition to intracellular transport , the dynamic cytoskeleton and its associated motors also stabilize the cell shape , adjust it to different environmental circumstances , and drive cell motility or division @xcite .",
    "+ the two main constituents of the cytoskeleton involved in intracellular transport are the polarized microtubules and actin filaments . in cells with a centrosome ,",
    "the rigid microtubules grow radially from the central mtoc ( microtubule organizing center ) towards the cell periphery . in conjunction with the associated motor proteins kinesin and dynein",
    ", microtubules manage fast long - range transport between the cell center and periphery .",
    "in contrast to microtubules , which spread through the whole cell , actin filaments are mostly accumulated in a random fashion underneath the plasma membrane and construct the so called actin cortex @xcite .",
    "myosin motors operate on actin filaments and are therefore specialized for lateral transport in the cell periphery . consequently",
    ", the cytoskeletal structure is very inhomogeneous and characterized by a thin actin cortical layer @xcite .",
    "+ the ` saltatory ' transport @xcite by molecular motors is a cooperative mechanism .",
    "several motors of diverse species are simultaneously attached to one cargo @xcite .",
    "this enables a frequent exchange between actin and microtubule based transport , which is necessary for specific search problems .",
    "a prominent example of collaborative transport on actin and microtubule networks is the motion of pigment granules in fish and frog melanophores @xcite .",
    "the activity level of the particular motor species , and thus the share in cooperation , is regulated by cell signaling @xcite . in fish and frog , pigment granules are accumulated near the nucleus by extracellular stimuli transduced via pka ( protein kinase a ) @xcite . the motor activity is thereby controlled via the level of camp ( cyclic adenosine monophosphate ) . while low concentrations promote the action of dyneins , intermediate values stimulate myosin motors and high amounts of camp active kinesins @xcite . moreover , the infection of cells by adenoviruses triggers signaling through pka and map ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) , which enhances transport to the nucleus @xcite ; and the net transport of lipid droplets in drosophila is directed to the cell center ( periphery ) by absence ( presence ) of the transacting factor halo @xcite . +",
    "another aspect of intracellular transport is its intermittent nature .",
    "molecular motors perform two phases of motility .",
    "periods of directed active motion along cytoskeletal filaments interfere with effectively stationary states @xcite .",
    "intersection nodes of the cytoskeleton cause the molecular motors to pause until they either manage to squeeze through the constriction and pass it on the same filament or switch to the crossing track and thus change the direction of the transported cargo @xcite .",
    "motor proteins also detach of the filaments out of chemical reasons . in the cytoplasm the cargoes experience",
    "subdiffusive dynamics due to crowding effects @xcite .",
    "the displacement is limited to the vicinity of the detachment site and negligible compared to the one of the active motion phase .",
    "hence , detachment and reattachment processes effectively contribute to waiting times .",
    "however , cargo particles preferentially change their direction of motion at cytoskeletal intersections , which constitute motion barriers .",
    "the mean distance between two intersections , the mesh size of a network , is typically smaller than the processive run length of a single molecular motor @xcite .",
    "+ the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton as well as the activity of the different motor species and their behavior at network intersections establish a typical stochastic movement pattern of intracellular cargo , which suggests a random walk description @xcite .",
    "the narrow escape problem depicts a common delivery process , where the target destination is represented by a specific , usually small region on the plasma membrane of a cell .",
    "typical examples involve regulated secretion processes of neurotransmitters or digestive enzymes . in immune cells , secretory vesicles",
    "are actively transported to the immunological synapse @xcite . moreover",
    ", the outgrowth of dendrites or axons from neurons @xcite as well as repair mechanisms for corruptions of a cell s plasma membrane @xcite require the target - oriented transport of mitochondria and vesicles .",
    "in the following , we present a coarse grained model of intracellular transport by considering the effective movement between network nodes , while discarding the single steps of individual motors at the molecular level . we introduce a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states where the dynamic cytoskeleton is implicitly modeled by probability density functions for network orientation and mesh size . within that framework",
    ", we address the effects of the interplay between inhomogeneous cytoskeletal architecture and motor performance on the search efficiency to narrow escapes alongside the membrane of a cell .",
    "cells establish specific search strategies for cargo transport by alterations of the cytoskeletal organization and regulation of the motor behavior at network intersections . in order to study the efficiency of spatially inhomogeneous search strategies",
    "we formulate a random velocity model in continuous space and time composed of two states of motility : ( i ) a ballistic motion state at constant speed @xmath0 , which corresponds to active transport by molecular motors in between two successive intersections of the filamentous network and ( ii ) a waiting state , which is associated to pauses at intersection nodes of the cytoskeleton .",
    "the swaps from one state to another are arranged via constant but generally asymmetric transition rates @xmath1 for a switch from motion to waiting and @xmath2 for an inverse transition , see figure [ figure1 ] ( b ) . these lead",
    "to exponentially distributed time periods @xmath3 , @xmath4 spent in each state of motility @xmath5 and mean residence times of @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the motion and waiting state , respectively , which is biologically consistent as active lifetimes of cargo particles are exponentially distributed @xcite .",
    "the event rates are directly connected to biologically tractable properties of the cytoskeleton and the motor proteins .",
    "the mesh size @xmath8 of the underlying cytoskeletal network , which reflects the typical distance between two consecutive intersections , defines the rate @xmath9 for a transition from the ballistic motion to the pausing state . whereas the event rate @xmath2 is determined by the characteristic waiting time at an intersection node .",
    "+ whenever a particle has reached a network intersection and paused , it may either keep moving processively along the same filament with probability @xmath10 or it may change to a crossing track with probability @xmath11 , as sketched in figure [ figure1 ] ( d ) .",

    "our model system is designed according to the inhomogeneous internal organization of a cell , see figure [ figure1 ] ( a ) .",
    "we assume a circular confined geometry of radius @xmath18 , which displays the plasma membrane and will be fixed in the following ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the cytoplasm is split into an interior region , where only microtubules are present , and a periphery , which is dominated by the actin cortex but may also be pervaded by microtubules .",
    "the width of the actin cortical layer is denoted by @xmath20 , so that an internal margin of radius @xmath21 emerges . throughout this article ,",
    "the target destination of the cargo is assumed to be a narrow escape hole in the plasma membrane with opening angle @xmath22 .",
    "the interior of a cell is controlled by the radial network of microtubules with its associated kinesin and dynein motors . since they manage fast long - range transport inside a cell , the rate to switch from the motion to the waiting state @xmath23",
    "is fixed to zero for simplicity .",
    "this leads to uninterrupted radial movement along the internal microtubule network .",
    "however , the particle may be forced into the waiting state due to confinement events , so the transition rate to the motion state is set to a non - zero value @xmath24 .",
    "due to the complex network structure of the periphery the searcher frequently encounters intersection nodes at rate @xmath25 and switches to the waiting state .",
    "subsequently , the particle may either keep moving along the previously used track at rate @xmath26 or it may change to a crossing filament at rate @xmath27 . the rotation angle is thereby drawn of a distribution @xmath28 which specifies the peripheral environment in terms of the filament orientation ( @xmath29 ) and motor species activity ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "the spatial geometry of the model system imposes various confinement events , which are further specified in the following . at the onset",
    ", each searcher is assumed to start its walk in the center of the cell , where it is linked to a kinesin and runs in a uniformly distributed initial direction .",
    "as soon as a particle encounters the outer membrane margin at radius @xmath18 it will switch into the pausing state , since it is assumed to detach of the filament , and check for the target zone @xmath22 .",
    "if it is found , the walk will be terminated , otherwise the particle will wait at rate @xmath27 and the rotation angle distribution will be restricted to allowed values .",
    "the same holds in the case that a cargo transported by myosin hits the internal margin @xmath40 , which is created by the structural inhomogeneity of the cytoskeleton .",
    "crossovers of the internal margin by kinesins or dyneins , happen uninterruptedly under a change of the characteristic event rates for interior and periphery .",
    "whenever a dynein coupled particle reaches the mtoc in the center of the cell , it will wait with rate @xmath24 before it will change to kinesin motion in a uniformly distributed direction .",
    "consequently , the mean waiting time at confinement events is not necessarily the same as the one at network intersections in the bulk .",
    "in general it will be larger .",
    "in the following , we perform extensive monte carlo simulations in order to analyze the dependence of the search efficiency to narrow escapes alongside a cell s membrane on the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton as well as the motor performance at network intersections . at first , we will consider search strategies , where the motors operate on homogeneous cytoskeletal networks .",
    "then , we will focus on the inhomogeneous architecture and elaborate the influence of the actin cortical width on the mean first passage properties of narrow escape problems .          here , we neglect the inhomogeneous structure of the cytoskeleton and assume that it spreads through the whole cell in a homogeneous manner .",
    "since we aim to isolate the impact of the cytoskeletal architecture , we ignore the motor s processivity ( @xmath41 ) and waiting processes ( @xmath42 ) .",

    "intermediate values of @xmath33 correspond to cooperative transport on homogeneous combinations of microtubules and actin filaments with active kinesins , dyneins and myosins .",
    "sample trajectories which implicitly reflect the network structure are given in figure [ figure2 ] . in order to investigate the influence of the network composition and motor activity",
    ", we measure the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) in dependence of the target size @xmath22 for different event rates @xmath1 and various probabilities @xmath33 .",
    "as expected , the mfpt increases monotonically with decreasing opening angle @xmath22 , see figure [ figure2 ] ( c ) .",
    "apparently , directional changes at intersections of a homogeneous cytoskeletal network do not improve the search efficiency nor does a cooperative behavior of different motor species ( @xmath470;1[$ ] ) .",
    "the mfpt increases with greater transition rate @xmath1 and is quite robust against alterations of the probability @xmath33 .",
    "however , we notice that a random actin mesh ( @xmath46 ) is preferable to a radial microtubule network ( @xmath45 ) .      in case of a homogeneous cytoskeleton ,",
    "the most efficient search strategy is an uninterrupted motion on a pure and random actin network without any directional changes in the bulk .",
    "such a motion scheme is sufficient for large membranous targets , but actually fails for narrow escape problems .",
    "may an inhomogeneous search strategy , like it is found in living cells , be the key to the efficient detection of small departure zones on the plasma membrane ?",
    "guided by this question , we check for the influence of the actin cortical width @xmath20 on the effectiveness of the narrow escape search problem .      in order to investigate the pristine effect of an inhomogeneous cytoskeleton , we perform monte carlo simulations and assume @xmath48 , @xmath49 in the interior and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath41 in the periphery . consequently , the cargo changes its direction of motion instantaneously at each intersection node .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] displays the resulting mfpt to small membranous target sites ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) in dependence of the actin cortical width @xmath20 for different peripheral mesh sizes defined by the node encountering rate @xmath25 and motor activities @xmath33 , @xmath44 .",
    "+ remarkably , we find that the mfpt responds sensitively to alterations of the motor activity @xmath33 and exhibits a nontrivial minimum for @xmath54 and small targets .",

    "contrary , a high activity of dyneins would be favourable for virus trafficking to the nucleus .",

    "the search is managed on a homogeneous network composed of actin filaments and microtubules according to the probabilities @xmath33 , @xmath44 .",

    "the cargo is transported on a homogeneous network of radial microtubules . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the resulting mfpt is represented by the dashed black line in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "+ moreover , the mfpt diverges in the limit of @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "cargo particles which are transported by myosins get localized for narrow actin cortices , since the resulting prompt collisions with the two margins at radii @xmath40 and @xmath18 inhibit substantially large displacements .",
    "thus , the actin cortex can also act as a barrier for transport to a cell s plasma membrane .",
    "the results shown in figure [ figure4 ] visualize that an increased chance of directional alterations by increase of @xmath25 , leads to a loss of search efficiency .",
    "this directly suggests a profit by a processive behavior of motor proteins at intersection nodes .",
    "furthermore , a decrease in the opening angle @xmath22 provokes a more prominent minimum of the mfpt at lower cortical widths @xmath20 , compare figure [ figure4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "so far the waiting times , which are induced by intersection nodes and confinement events , have been neglected by fixing the rate to switch from waiting to motion to infinity , @xmath49 , @xmath51 . here",
    "we address the impact of the mean waiting time per arrest state . for that purpose",
    "we assume radial microtubules in the cell interior , @xmath48 , @xmath60 .",

    "figure [ figure5 ] ( b ) shows that the mmt displays pronounced minima and is indeed independent of the rate @xmath2 and thus fully determined by the mesh size of the network given via @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to that , the mwt , given in figure [ figure5 ] ( c ) , depends on both rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the rate @xmath2 determines the mean waiting time per arrest state , it influences the mwt only via a multiplicative factor , as obvious by the shift in figure [ figure5 ] ( c ) for @xmath66 .",
    "the impact of the transition rate @xmath2 on the mwt can be excluded by the transformation to the mean number of waiting periods @xmath67 the inset of figure [ figure5 ] ( c ) displays its dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath20 . remarkably",

    "+ consequently , we can solve the question of the shift in @xmath64 for @xmath66 presented in figure [ figure5 ] ( a ) . in the case of @xmath66 ,",
    "the mmt exhibits a minimum at roughly @xmath68 ( figure [ figure5 ] ( b ) ) , while a minimum at @xmath69 emerges for the number of waiting periods and thus also for the mwt ( figure [ figure5 ] ( c ) and inset ) .",
    "hence , the optimal cortical width @xmath64 of the mfpt , which is the sum of mmt and mwt , undergoes a crossover from @xmath68 to @xmath69 as the impact of waiting times increases with decreasing rate @xmath2 .",
    "+ in conclusion , the mwt dominates the behavior of the first passage properties in the limit of @xmath2 .",
    "this results in a shift of the optimal width @xmath64 in dependence of the mesh size of the underlying network defined by @xmath1 . for small rates",
    "@xmath1 a raising impact of waiting times may lead to a shift of @xmath64 from intermediate values to @xmath70 ( compare to the inset of figure [ figure5 ] ( c ) ) and thus a favour of homogeneous cytoskeleton .",

    "the polarity of the actin filaments in the cortex is typically random .",
    "hence we have previously investigated uniform rotation angle distributions @xmath72 .",

    "such mechanisms influence the orientational distribution of the actin filaments .",
    "+ here , we study the impact of the expectation value and width of a cut - off - gaussian rotation angle distribution @xmath74 ( as given in equation [ eq : rotanglemyosin ] ) on the search efficiency to narrow membranous targets .",
    "a mean value @xmath75 leads to predominantly radial actin filaments , whereas @xmath76 corresponds to an essentially lateral orientation according to the branching pattern generated by polymerization proteins . in order to isolate the influence of the orientational distribution we assume @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath77 , @xmath51 .",

    "<S> we formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states . with extensive computer simulations </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dependence of the mean first passage times for narrow escape problems on the structural characteristics of the cytoskeleton , the motor properties and the fraction of time spent in each state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that an inhomogeneous architecture with a small width of the actin cortex constitutes an efficient intracellular search strategy . </S>"
