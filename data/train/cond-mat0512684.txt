    "given the rapid development of the technology in the fabrication and manipulation of semiconductor structures , there has been great interest in the study of different mesoscopic systems , specially involving quantum dots .",
    "many atomic effects as the kondo and fano effects can also be observed in these systems and in controllable way@xcite . those work deal mainly with the well known aharonov - bohm interferometer , which is basically a ring attached to at least two external leads .",
    "then it is possible to measure , for instance , the interference pattern of the electronic wave function as a function of an external magnetic field , or the dephasing of this very function by the tunneling of the electron through the quantum dot , among many other features .",
    "we are here basically interested in an isolated ring with an embedded quantum dot , and its effect on the persistent current .",
    "some recent works@xcite have driven attention to this problem , specially in the kondo regime .",
    "however none of them consider the disorder in the ring , and are solved numerically by means of the slave - boson mean - field theory .",
    "we propose a new approach to the problem , and also find some interesting typically quantum features of the current that were not observed before .",
    "[ ] [ ] qd [ ] [ ] @xmath0 [ ] [ ]  @xmath1 [ ] [ ] @xmath2     following the iwz model@xcite , we consider the simplest case and divide our system into two boxes : one of the quantum dot ( qd ) and the other of the ring ( see ) .",

    "@xmath5 is the radius of the wigner semicircle .",
    "the qd is assumed to have one single level @xmath0 .",
    "we include the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase in the coupling term between the walls of the qd and the ring .",
    "doing so , the coupling is given by v()=v_l^i+v_r^-i = v_0().here @xmath6 are the coupling through the left and right side of the dot , which we can consider essentially the same .",
    "the ab phase is @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . in this way",

    "this difficulty was proposed in ref.@xcite , and what we have to do is make an average over the number of electrons too .",
    "this approach is ideal for treating an ensemble of rings , since due to uncertainties in their shapes , it is clear that the number of electrons is not the same in every ring , but must fluctuate about an average value @xmath17 with an amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the fermi energy is allowed to vary in an interval @xmath19 $ ] of length @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the mean level space at the fermi surface .",
    "thus we have the following expression for the current :    ( ) & = - _ se _ 0^ee .",
    "the bar denotes the average over the impurities .",
    "we see here that the current is expressed as a product of an advanced and a retarded green function , which is essentially a two - point function .",
    "it is useful to define a generating functional @xmath23 from which we can obtain the current as simple derivatives , and furthermore , we can write our hamiltonian in a gaussian form such the procedure of averaging can be easily performed .",
    "we follow here the standard steps in the way presented in ref .",
    "this generating function must then have the form z[j , ] = [ ] \\{i2 ^l^1/2dl^1/2 } where @xmath24 is a graded vector of dimension @xmath25 and has the form : _",

    "the energy of the qd can be tuned experimentally through the gate potential @xmath92 .",
    "the natural energy unit adopted for the parameters is the fermi energy of the ring @xmath14 . for a semiconductor ring constituted of a gaalas / gaas heterostructure of mesoscopic dimensions ,",
    "i.e. , with a diameter of @xmath93 , the total electron number is of thousands and the fermi energy laying in the mev .",
    "the electron effective mass is about 0.07 the free electron mass@xcite and the elastic mean free path is about the circumference of the ring .                                                                                                            in the first plot we observe that the periodicity of the current is @xmath97 , double of the value found in the case without the qd .",
    "first , we should remember that the persistent current in a single isolated ring has a periodicity with the magnetic flux of @xmath97 both for the case of an odd or even number of electrons .",
    "what differs the current in each case is just a shift of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , due to the very symmetry of those plots , when we perform an average over the number of electrons , i.e. , we sum the currents in both cases , we end up with a current with a periodicity of @xmath98 .",
    "this is valid for a ring with or without disorder@xcite .",
    "the conclusion we can derive here is that the very presence of the qd breaks down the symmetry of the current for an even or odd number of electrons . such asymmetry was also observed for a clean ring in the kondo regime@xcite , but now we can see that this feature is even more general .",
    "another remark to be done is about the coupling constant . for small values of this quantity ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "the current is basically a sine and it scales with @xmath91 , such that @xmath100 is an universal function . for growing values of @xmath91",
    "the current form begins to alter , the maximum ( and minimum ) of the curve approaches @xmath98 and its amplitudes grows a bit slower with @xmath101 . in",
    "we see how the current behaves as a function of @xmath91 for some selected values of the magnetic flux .",
    "the first and obvious conclusion is that the current vanishes when @xmath102 , then this case is like we had opened the ring and no current is allowed to flow . in the same manner for @xmath91",
    "very big , what we get again is a vanishing current .",
    "what happens now is something different .",
    "the life time of the resonance is inversely proportional to @xmath91 and therefore the probability of the electron to pass through the qd is diminished .",
    "if there is experimentally a controllable way to alter the coupling between the ring and the dot , then this plot shows where we can get a maximum amplitude for the current .                                                                                                            our main result ,",
    "however , may be observed in , where we have analyzed the variation of the current amplitude as function of the energy of qd level .",
    "we have observed a peak in the current for @xmath0 near the fermi energy of the ring .",
    "such result is expected if we note that , in the case without the qd , the main contribution for the total current comes from the current associated with the electron in the uppermost level .",
    "thus , when the energy of the qd coincides with this energy , there is a peak in the current indicating the resonance between both levels .",
    "the second peak however is quite curious .",
    "it occurs at about half of the fermi energy and is symmetric to the first , only with opposite signal .",
    "the explanation for this phenomenon is the following .",
    "the coupling between the energy levels in the ring and that of the qd gives then a width and a lorentzian shape .",
    "since the current is essentially a derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetic flux , we get that the individual level contribution for the total current is proportional to the difference of its energy and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , when the qd level crosses down the fermi energy , the contribution of the levels with higher energies than @xmath0 have opposite signal . for a given value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the total current vanish . lowering @xmath0",
    "even more , the current changes signal and increases until it reaches a maximum value and then decreases again as @xmath0 is much lower than the energy levels of the ring .",
    "unlikely the results obtained in other works@xcite , this extra peak is neither related to the fano effect nor to the kondo effect .",
    "the fano effect@xcite occurs when there is an interference between two paths through which the electron can pass , one with discrete levels , and the other a continuous band . to observe such effect",
    ", one may use one ring with a qd and two leads connected in opposite sides of the ring@xcite .",
    "measuring the conductance we find peaks with asymmetric line shapes . on the other hand , kondo effect@xcite is related to the fact that the qd behaves like a magnetic impurity in the ring , and to observe it , it is necessary that the net spin in the dot be different of zero . as a result of the correlations between the electrons in the qd and those of the conduction band , there is a resonance near the fermi energy with works as an extra channel for the electron tunneling .",
    "our model does not account for the electronic spin and therefore there is no way of interpreting our result as a kondo resonance , furthermore the second peak lays far below the fermi level . in conclusion ,",
    "the second peak arises as a constructive interference phenomenon between the levels of the ring and is purely a manifestation of the quantum nature of the system ."
