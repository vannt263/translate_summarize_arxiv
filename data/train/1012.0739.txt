    "this is the third in a series of three articles about the characterization , the construction and the basic properties of brownian motions on metric graphs . in the first of these articles  @xcite ,",
    "brownian motions on metric graphs have been defined , their feller property has been shown , and their generators have been determined , i.e. , the analogue of feller s theorem for metric graphs has been proved . in the second article  @xcite , all possible brownian motions on single vertex graphs were constructed .",
    "in the present article all possible brownian motions ( as defined in  @xcite ) on a general metric graph are constructed from the trajectories of brownian motions on single vertex graphs . in a companion article  @xcite , which serves more as a background for this series and which can also be read as an introduction to the topic",
    ", we revisit the classical cases of brownian motions on bounded intervals and on the semi - line @xmath3 , see  @xcite .",
    "for a general introduction to the subject of this article we refer the interested reader to  @xcite , henceforth quoted as `` article  i '' , while  @xcite is cited as `` article  ii '' .",
    "we shall refer to equations , definitions , theorems etc.from article  i or ii by placing an `` i '' or `` ii '' , respectively , in front .",
    "for example , `` formula  '' refers to formula  ( [ i_eq_2_4 ] ) in article  i , while `` definition  i.[i_def_3_1 ] '' points to definition  [ i_def_3_1 ] in article  i. unless otherwise mentioned , we continue to use the notation and the conventions set up in these articles .",
    "metric graphs arise as the underlying structure of models in many domains of science , such as physics , chemistry , computer science and engineering to mention just a few .",
    "we refer the interested reader to  @xcite for a review of such models and for further references .",
    "mathematically , metric graphs are piecewise linear spaces with singularities at the vertices of the graph . in the present series of articles we exclusively consider _ finite _ metric graphs .",
    "heuristically speaking a finite metric graph may be viewed as a finite collection of compact or semi - infinite intervals  the edges  with some of their endpoints  the vertices  identified .",
    "the standard metric on the real line induces thereon a metric in a natural way .",
    "a formal definition can be found , e.g. , in article  i , and the most important notions are also given in section  [ sect2 ] below .",

    "the basic strategy is laid out in section  [ sect2 ] : there we show how one can construct from two metric graphs a new metric graph by joining a certain number of external edges of the given graphs . furthermore",
    ", if one is given two brownian motions ( in the sense of article  i ) on the given graphs , then on the new graph a brownian motion is constructed from the previous ones by pasting their trajectories together appropriately .",

    "assume furthermore , that we are given data @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 as in equations  , .",
    "we want to construct a brownian motion @xmath5 on @xmath0 the implementing boundary conditions corresponding to these data .",
    "let @xmath54 be the metric graph obtained from @xmath0 by replacing the tadpole by two external edges @xmath543 , @xmath544 , incident with @xmath24 .",
    "construct a brownian motion @xmath545 on @xmath54 corresponding to the data @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 as above .",
    "consider the real line @xmath546 as a single vertex graph @xmath55 with the origin as the vertex @xmath547 , and edges @xmath548 , @xmath549 which are isomorphic to @xmath12 , @xmath550 $ ] . take a walsh process @xmath551 on this graph which with probability @xmath538 chooses either edge for the next excursion when at the origin .",
    "then @xmath551 is just a `` skew '' brownian motion as in  @xcite which actually is not skew .",
    "that is , it is equivalent to a standard brownian motion on the real line",
    ".    now join @xmath54 and @xmath55 by connecting the pairs @xmath69 , @xmath70 via two new internal edges of length @xmath552 .",
    "denote the resulting metric graph by @xmath553 .",
    "figure  [ tad_ii ] shows this construction .     constructed from @xmath54 and @xmath55.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "+    construct a brownian motion @xmath554 on @xmath555 from @xmath545 and @xmath551 as in section  [ sect2 ] . by construction , @xmath554 is equivalent to a standard brownian motion in every neighborhood of @xmath547 which is small enough such that it does not include the vertex @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the additional vertex @xmath547 of @xmath0 does not yield any non - trivial boundary condition .",
    "thus , if we identify the open tadpole edge @xmath556 with the subset of @xmath55 isomorphic to @xmath557 , then we obtain a brownian motion @xmath5 on @xmath0 implementing the desired boundary conditions .",
    "obviously , any ( finite ) number of tadpoles can be handled in the same way .",
    "we recall from section  [ sect2 ] that in terms of the process @xmath171 the crossover times @xmath230 , @xmath206 , can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath171 start in @xmath164 .",
    "then @xmath247 is the hitting time of @xmath249 by @xmath171 . in particular , @xmath250 for all paths of @xmath171 . for @xmath309",
    ", @xmath230 is the hitting time after @xmath252 of @xmath251 by @xmath171 . since by construction @xmath558 and",
    "the paths of @xmath171 are continuous on @xmath559 , we get @xmath560 for all paths of @xmath171 .",
    "therefore @xmath561 holds .",
    "set @xmath227 , and for @xmath206 , @xmath562              v_c\\setminus\\{k_{n-1}\\ } , & \\text{otherwise}.            \\end{cases}\\ ] ] for @xmath206 , @xmath563 define @xmath564      b_{n , r } & = \\bigcap_{m\\in{\\mathbb{n}}}\\bigcup_{u\\in{\\mathbb{q}},\\,0\\le u\\le r } \\bigl\\{s_{n-1}\\le u,\\ ,                              d\\bigl(y(u ) , v_n\\bigr)\\le 1/m,\\,r < \\zeta\\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we claim that for all @xmath206 , @xmath563 , @xmath565 to prove this claim , suppose first that @xmath566 .",
    "then @xmath239 is finite , and therefore the set @xmath567 is non - empty .",
    "thus there exists a sequence @xmath568 in this set which decreases to @xmath239 .",
    "since @xmath236 is continuous on @xmath569 , it follows that @xmath570 . by assumption , @xmath571 , and therefore the continuity of @xmath236 on @xmath569 and @xmath572",
    "imply that for every @xmath347 there exists @xmath573 $ ] so that @xmath574 .",
    "hence @xmath575 .    as for the converse",

    "then there exists a sequence @xmath576 in @xmath577 $ ] so that @xmath578 converges to zero as @xmath298 tends to infinity . since @xmath576 is bounded we may assume , by selecting a subsequence if necessary , that @xmath576 converges to some @xmath579 $ ] as @xmath580 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath581 , and therefore @xmath236 hits @xmath582 in the interval @xmath583 $ ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath584 , and hence @xmath566 , concluding the proof of the claim .",
    "next we prove by induction that for every @xmath206 , @xmath230 is an @xmath253stopping time .",
    "let @xmath585 . by   for every @xmath586 , @xmath587 clearly , @xmath588 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath589 is a deterministic set , @xmath590 is measurable from @xmath0 to @xmath3 , and therefore @xmath591 .",
    "hence @xmath592 .",
    "let @xmath593 , and write @xmath594 therefore @xmath595 , and hence @xmath247 is a stopping time relative to @xmath253",
    ".    now suppose that @xmath206 , @xmath309 , and that @xmath252 is an @xmath253stopping time . we show that for all @xmath563 , @xmath596 .",
    "first we remark that since @xmath0 is a separable metric space , the metric @xmath597 on @xmath0 is a measurable mapping from @xmath598 to @xmath599 .",
    "for example , this follows from theorem  i.1.10 in  @xcite , and the continuity of @xmath600 when @xmath601 is equipped with the product topology .",
    "consider @xmath602 .",
    "since @xmath171 has right continuous paths it is progressively measurable relative to @xmath253 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  i.4.8 ) ) .",
    "thus by proposition  i.4.9 in  @xcite it follows that @xmath603 is @xmath604measurable .",
    "consequently on @xmath605 , @xmath603 is @xmath606measurable .",
    "equation   reads @xmath607 it follows that @xmath596 , as claimed . but then @xmath608 for all @xmath221 is proved with the same argument as at the end of the discussion of the case @xmath585 .",
