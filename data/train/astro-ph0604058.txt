    "the evolution of star forming galaxies tells much about the history of the universe .",
    "the star formation activity in these galaxies can be best studied by observing the emission from young massive stars in the rest frame uv and fir .",
    "the uv observations record the direct light from the hot young stars , and the fir observations collect star light absorbed and then re - emitted by the ubiquitous dust . a complete picture of star formation in the universe can only be obtained when the observations in these two wavebands are properly synthesized .",
    "indeed , our knowledge on the star formation history of the universe has been mostly derived from deep surveys in the rest frame uv and fir .",
    "many studies have been devoted to methods of deriving star formation rate of individual galaxies using the uv or fir luminosities ( calzetti 1997 ; meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; buat & xu 1996 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the strengths and shortcoming of these methods have been discussed thoroughly in the literature ( kennicutt 1998 ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ; bell 2002 ; bell 2003 ; buat et al .",
    "2005 ; kong et al . 2004 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , an arguably more important issue is the selection effect of the surveys that can be summed up by the following question : do uv and fir surveys see the two sides ( bright and dark ) of the star formation of the same population of galaxies , or do they see two different populations of star forming galaxies ? this is important because if the correct answer is the latter , then even if one can estimate accurately the star formation rate for galaxies in surveys in one band , the star formation in galaxies detected in the other band is still missing .",
    "actually this question is in the core of an on - going debate on whether the sfr of z@xmath4 universe can be derived from observations of lyman - break galaxies , which are uv selected star forming galaxies at z@xmath4 ( adelberger and steidel 2000 ) , given that scuba surveys in sub - millimeter ( rest frame fir for z@xmath5 ) detected many violent star forming galaxies at about the same redshift that are not seen by lbg surveys ( smail et al .",
    "2001 ; smail et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "there have been limited overlaps between rest frame uv surveys and rest frame ir surveys . in the scuba survey of lbg s ( chapman et al .",
    "2000 ) , only one lbg was detected .",
    "as summarized in adelberger and steidel ( 2000 ) , only a couple of scuba sources are bright enough in optical to be detected in lbg surveys .",
    "the situation is better for z@xmath6 star forming galaxies , which now can be routinely identified by large scale spectroscopic surveys and multi - band optical surveys , and which have been detected in abundance in mid - infrared by isocam deep surveys ( elbaz et al .",
    "2002 ; hammer et al .",
    "2005 ) and spitzer surveys ( le floch 2005 ) , and in uv by galex ( arnouts et al . 2005 ; burgarella et al .",
    "however the extrapolation from the mid - ir to the total dust emission is very uncertain and may subject to significant evolution itself . the same criticism can also be applied to the comparisons between rest frame uv and mir sources at z@xmath7 , the latter being detected recently by spizter at 24@xmath8 ( chary et al .",
    "2004 ; shupe et al .",
    "because of the relatively high confusion limits for surveys in the spitzer mips 70@xmath9 and 160@xmath9 bands , thorough comparisons of rest frame uv and fir sources of z@xmath10 , down to luminosity levels fainter than the knee of the luminosity functions of both bands , may have to wait until the launch of herschel ( pilbratt 2005 ) .    in this paper , we investigate the difference and overlaps of the uv and fir selected samples in the local universe in an attempt to shed light on the selection effects of high - z samples similarly selected .",

    "( 2006 ) and buat et al .",
    "the original uv selected sample ( iglesias - pramo et al .",

    "since this is very close to the classical k ( 2.2@xmath9 ) magnitude , we will call it k magnitude hereafter for the sake of simplicity . for both the uv selected sample ( 94 galaxies ) and the fir selected sample ( 161 galaxies ) , each has 12 galaxies undetected by 2mass . according to the sensitivity limit of 2mass xsc ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) , upper limits of k=13.5 mag are assigned to the undetections .",
    "morphological classifications were searched in ned . for those galaxies without morphological classification in the literature , images taken from sdss , dss and 2mass ( in the order of priority ) were inspected and eye - ball classification was carried out .",
    "galaxies included in atlas of peculiar galaxies ( arp 1966 ) , southern peculiar galaxies and associations ( arp & madore 1987 ) , and catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies ( karachentsev 1972 ) are classified as peculiar , interacting or mergers . for a few galaxies that are faint ( b @xmath26 mag ) and small ( @xmath27 ) the classification can be very uncertain .",
    "most of such galaxies are in the fir selected sample , and very often there is clear sign of interaction ( close companion of similar brightness and/or diffuse tidal features ) . in fig.1 the distributions of morphological types ( not including qsos and ellipticals ) of the two samples are compared .",
    "the overall overlap between the two distributions is about 60% .",
    "there is a significant excess of pec / int / merg galaxies in the fir selected sample ( 39% ) compared to those in the uv selected sample ( 14% ) . for normal galaxies both uv and fir selected samples peak in the bin of sab / sb / sbc .",
    "detailed analysis shows that the median type for normal uv galaxies is sc and that of normal fir galaxies is sb .",
    "the fir selected sample is tilted toward the earlier spirals whereas the uv sample has more late type ( later than sc ) galaxies .",
    "much of the difference between uv and fir selected samples can be traced back to a single selection effect : uv observations detect preferentially galaxies with low l@xmath28 ratios , and in contrast fir observations select galaxies with high l@xmath29/l@xmath30 ratios . since the fir / uv ratio is a good indicator of dust attenuation ( xu & buat 1995 ; buat & xu 1996 ; meurer et al . 1999 ; gordon 2000 ) , it follows that uv samples select galaxies with significantly lower dust attenuation than galaxies in the fir selected sample : buat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a median fuv attenuation of @xmath31 mag for the uv selected sample , compared to a @xmath32 mag for the fir selected sample .",
    "it has been well established that there is a strong correlation between luminosity and dust attenuation in the sense that more luminous galaxies have higher dust attenuation ( wang & heckman 1996 ; buat & burgarella 1998 ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ; m05 ) .",
    "fig.2 shows that galaxies in both fir and uv samples follow the strong @xmath33 vs. l@xmath0 correlation .",
    "on the other hand , uv galaxies in general have significantly lower l@xmath0 and lower @xmath33 ratios for a given l@xmath0 compared to fir galaxies ( buat & burgarella 1998 ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 ) . can these trends be attributed solely to the selection effects , or do they reflect some intrinsic differences between the two populations ?    in order to answer this question , we have to compare the statistics of l@xmath0 and of @xmath33 that are free from the selection effect .",
    "the selection effect is introduced by the so - called ` malmquist bias ' on both flux limited samples : for a given l@xmath0 , galaxies with higher fir - to - uv ratios have brighter @xmath34 , therefore can be seen at larger distances ( i.e. having a larger maximum finding volume v@xmath35 ) in a @xmath36 limited sample .",
    "similarly , for a given l@xmath0 , galaxies with lower fir - to - uv ratios have higher @xmath37 and therefore larger @xmath38 in a uv flux limited sample .",
    "in what follows we shall compare the l@xmath0 luminosity functions ( lfs hereafter ) of the two samples to exam whether they have the same intrinsic l@xmath0 distributions . because lfs are luminosity distributions of galaxies in a unit volume , they are not subject to the bias discussed above .    here",
    "we exclude the sources whose iras fluxes are affected by the cirrus .",
    "also uv galaxies not covered by the iras survey are dropped .",
    "this reduces the fir sample to 151 galaxies and the uv sample to 81 galaxies .",
    "the iras detections of 5 uv galaxies are confused with other uv sources , therefore the corresponding iras fluxes are treated as upperlimits . altogether 14 uv galaxies have only upperlimits for the iras flux . for galaxies in the fir selected sample , 14 have only upperlimits for the fuv flux .",
    "define @xmath39 as the l@xmath0 lf of uv selected galaxies at @xmath40 , @xmath41 the fuv ( 1530 ) lf at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the conditional probability of finding uv galaxies of @xmath44 in the bin of @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 similarly , the l@xmath0 luminosity function of fir selected sample can be derived using the formula : @xmath47 where @xmath48 the conditional probability of finding fir galaxies of @xmath49 in the bin of @xmath50 .",

    "<S> we study two samples of local galaxies , one is uv ( galex ) selected and the other fir ( iras ) selected , to address the question whether uv and fir surveys see the two sides ( bright and dark ) of the star formation of the same population of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> no significant difference between the l@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) luminosity functions of the uv and fir samples is found . also , after the correction for the ` malmquist bias ' ( bias for flux limited samples ) , the fir - to - uv ratio v.s . </S>",
    "<S> l@xmath0 relations of the two samples are consistent with each other . in the range of @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> both can be approximated by a simple linear relation of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent the same population of star forming galaxies , and their well documented differences in l@xmath0 and in fir - to - uv ratio are due only to the selection effect . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for a population of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample . the contribution from these fir - quiet galaxies to </S>",
    "<S> the overall uv population is insignificant , given that the k - band luminosity functions ( i.e. the stellar mass functions ) of the two samples do not show any significant difference . </S>"
