    "water plays an important role in many natural processes where it is confined or at contact with substrates .",
    "examples can be found in different fields of geology , biology , chemical engineering because water can be confined in rocks , in biological cells , at contact with surfaces of proteins , in biological membranes , etc @xcite . in three dimensions the qualitative behavior of water , including the waterlike anomalies ,",
    "can be described using the core - softened potentials with two length scales @xcite ) .",
    "the liquids with these potentials demonstrate anomalous behavior in some regions of thermodynamic parameters : their phase diagrams have regions where a thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( density anomaly ) , self - diffusivity increases upon compression ( diffusion anomaly ) , and the structural order of the system decreases with increasing pressure ( structural anomaly ) .",
    "this kind of behavior is characteristic of a number of real fluids , the most common and well known example is water . later on it was discovered that many other substances also demonstrate similar behavior .",
    "some typical examples are silica , silicon , phosphorus , etc .",
    "a lot of different core - softened potentials were introduced ( see , for example , reviews @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that in general the existence of two length scales is not compulsory to induce the occurrence of the anomalies .",
    "for example , for the models studied in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the existence of two distinct repulsive length scales is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of anomalous phase behavior .",
    "in general , the observation , that confined fluids microscopically relax and flow with different characteristic time scales than bulk liquids is hardly surprising . confining boundaries bias the spatial distribution of the constituent molecules and the ways by which those molecules can dynamically rearrange .",
    "these effects play important roles in the thermodynamics of the confined systems and influence the topology of the phase diagram . the general motivation for",
    "the study of different confined fluids follows from the observation that there are many real physical and biological phenomena and processes that depend on the properties of such systems and play an important role in the different fields of modern technology such as fabrication of nanomaterials , nanotribology , adhesion , and nanotechnology @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the nature of spatial ordering of a molecular system depends on the dimensionality of the space to which it is confined .",
    "as it was shown by mermin @xcite , in @xmath0 the long - range crystalline order is destroyed by the thermal fluctuations and has the quasi - long - range character .",
    "however , the real long range order does exist in this case - this is the order in orientations of bonds between the particle and its nearest neighbor ( bond - orientational order ) .    during the several decades ,",
    "the controversy about the nature of the @xmath0 melting transition is lasting .",
    "now it is widely accepted the theory by halperin , nelson , and young @xcite , based on the kosterlitz - thouless ideas @xcite ( kthny theory ) . in accordance with this theory , the scenario of two - dimensional melting is fundamentally different from the melting of three - dimensional systems . in @xmath0 case",
    "the transition between a crystal and an isotropic liquid can occur by means of two continuous transitions which correspond to dissociation of bound dislocation and disclination pairs , respectively .",
    "dissociation of the dislocation pairs at some temperature @xmath1 destroys the quasi - long - range translational order .",
    "the resulting phase has the short - range translational order , but the quasi - long - range bond orientational order .",
    "this phase is called the hexatic phase .",
    "the isotropic liquid appears as a result of dissociation of the disclination pairs at some temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the kthny theory have got an experimental support from the experiments with electrons on helium @xcite and the colloidal model system with repulsive magnetic dipole - dipole interaction @xcite . in the case of colloidal suspension , confined in a channel , reducing",
    "the channel size changes the system behavior from three - dimensional to two - dimensional , and colloidal monolayer displays continuous @xmath0 melting @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", a conventional first - order transition between a two - dimensional solid and an isotropic liquid can also occur ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , as it was shown in @xcite , at low disclination core energy system can melt through one first - order transition as a result of the dissociation of the disclination quadrupoles .    despite numerous experimental and simulation studies ,",
    "the situation is controversial - kthny theory seems universal and independent on the pair potential of the system , however , the systems with very short range or hard core potentials demonstrates the coexisting phases ( weak first - order transition ) , while the melting scenarios for the soft repulsive particles favor the kthny theory @xcite .",
    "even for simplest potential systems , including hard and soft disks or lennard - jones potentials , despite the tendency to the weak first - order melting transition , the simulation results are conflicting @xcite .",
    "the `` toy '' model for the investigation of the melting transition in @xmath0 , hard - disk system , have been studied in a large number of computer simulations without unambiguous conclusion about the melting scenario @xcite .",
    "it was even suggested an unexpected possibility of the first - order hexatic - isotropic liquid transition @xcite .    in general , one can conclude that the melting transition strongly depends on the pair interaction in the system .",
    "for instance , as shown by bladon and frenkel @xcite in the framework of the computer simulations , a @xmath0 solid of particles with short - range attraction can be unstable to dislocation unbinding in a region that is clearly thermodynamically stable with respect to the isotropic fluid .",
    "the system supports an isostructural solid  solid transition . in the vicinity of the critical temperature for this isostructural transition , fluctuations can induce formation of a hexatic phase .",
    "as the range of attraction part of the potential grows , the hexatic phase region becomes larger and moves toward the melting line .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the density functional calculations have shown that the @xmath0 square - well system can demonstrate both first - order and continuous melting phase transitions depending on the width of the attractive well .",
    "recently , prestipino et al @xcite presented a monte carlo simulation study of the phase behavior of two - dimensional classical particles repelling each other through an isotropic gaussian potential @xcite .",
    "they have shown , that as in the analogous three - dimensional case , a reentrant - melting transition occurs along with a spectrum of waterlike anomalies in the fluid phase . however , in @xmath0 melting is a continuous two - stage transition , with a narrow intermediate hexatic phase , in agreement with the kthny scenario .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , prestipino , saija , giaquinta considered the behavior of the system with the extremely soft yoshida and kamakura potential @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the model there exist three different crystal phases , one of them with square symmetry and the other two triangular .",
    "the most interesting fact is that the triangular solids melt into a hexatic fluid , while the square solid is directly transformed on heating into an isotropic fluid through a first - order transition .",
    "a whole spectrum of waterlike anomalies also exists for this model potential .    in our recent papers",
    "@xcite we presented a computer simulation study of the phase diagram and anomalous behavior of two - dimensional core - softened potential system @xcite with the soft core @xmath3 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found three different crystal phases , one of them with square symmetry and the other two triangular . in the low density part of the @xmath0 phase diagram , melting of the triangular phase",
    "is a continuous two - stage transition , with an intermediate hexatic phase .",
    "all available evidences support the kthny scenario for this melting transition . at high density part of the phase diagram square and triangular phases melt through one first - order transition .    on the other hand , in @xcite the phase diagram",
    "was studied for a square - shoulder square - well potential in two dimensions that has been previously shown to exhibit liquid anomalies consistent with a metastable liquid - liquid critical point @xcite .",
    "it was shown that all the melting lines are first order , despite a small range of metastability .",
    "this paper extends our previous results to the set of systems which are characterized by the different softness , in order to study the influence of the softness on the melting scenarios .",
    "we present a simulation study of phase behavior of the core - softened system , introduced in our previous publications @xcite , in two dimensions .",

    "double tangent construction gives the lines of the first order melting transition .    in order to proceed in analysis of the melting scenarios ,",
    "let us define the translational order parameter @xmath22 ( top ) , the orientational order parameter @xmath35 ( oop ) , and the bond - orientational correlation function @xmath36 ( ocf ) in the conventional way @xcite .",

    "melting of the crystal phase into hexatic phase or isotropic liquid is determined by the sharp decrease of @xmath22 .    to study the orientational order and the hexatic phase , let us define the local order parameter , which measures the @xmath40-fold orientational ordering , in the following way : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle of the bond between particles @xmath39 and @xmath43 with respect to a reference axis and the sum over @xmath43 is over all @xmath44 nearest - neighbors of @xmath43 , found from the voronoi construction .",
