    "the solar atmosphere is known to be strongly magnetised and dynamic in nature @xcite .",
    "the fine structure of this structured plasma environment consists of a wide range of distinct magnetic features like coronal loops , open flux tubes , prominences , etc .",
    "these structures play an important role in solar dynamics since they can support various type of mhd waves and oscillations which are thought to contribute to the solution of the long - standing problem of solar coronal heating ( for some recent reviews see , ; ; ; ) .",
    "observations indicate that waves and oscillations are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere (; ; ; ; ; ; . for recent reviews",
    "see , ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "many of the above reputs highlight that the waves or oscillations detected are seen to be strongly damped .",
    "a common suggested mechanisms for damping are resonant absorption @xcite and thermal conduction (;",
    ", @xcite ; ; ; ) which cause the damping of fast kink and ( slow or acoustic ) longitudinal waves , respectively .",
    "more recently , morton and erdlyi ( @xcite , @xcite ) argue that radiation of the background plasma may be a dominant damping mechanism for coronal oscillations .    in recent years",
    ", coronal waves have been used as a diagonstic tool to infer otherwise unmeasurable or hard to measure plasma parameters e.g. magnetic field @xcite and scale height @xcite . such a technique is known as magneto - seismology and was suggested by ; and in the context of coronal diagnostics .",
    "the concept was proposed to be used to any magnetic structure of the sun by and labelled as solar magneto - seismology .",
    "the models used for deriving the plasma parameters are all static in these earlier works , i.e. the background ( or equilibrium ) plasma is not dynamic , and background motion with cooling / heating is more than often neglected .",
    "however , there are numerous observations which show that the corona , and in particular coronal loops , are highly dynamic in nature , exhibiting flows , cooling and heating of the local plasma with a wide range of timescales . for accurate values of plasma parameters to be obtained from coronal magneto - seismology this dynamic nature of the plasma needs to be incorporated into the models and the importance of a dynamic background must be assessed .",
    "one feature which should be taken into account when studying the nature of coronal oscillations is the temperature evolution of the coronal plasma .",
    "there has been a plethora of observations which show a number of different temperature evolution scenarios ( e.g. ; ; ) .",
    "have observed that there are at least two categories of temperature evolution .",
    "hot loops , which are heated to temperatures @xmath0 mk , are seen by the x - ray imagers , e.g. , yohkoh s soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) and hinode s x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "the hot loops are short lived and are seen to undergo relatively fast cooling down to euv temperatures appearing in euv imagers , e.g. , soho / eit .",
    "another category is cool loops which are observed with temperatures @xmath1 mk in euv images and have relatively long lifetimes .",
    "the temperature changes on a slow scale when compared to the lifetime of perturbations , or even the loop one s itself and the loops exhibit limited dynamic behaviour .",
    "the physical process of the plasma cooling depends upon the loop temperature ( cool or hot ) .",
    "it has been found that radiation is the dominant mechanism for the cooling of the euv loops ( @xmath2 mk ) whereas thermal conduction is the cooling method for loops in the region of @xmath3 mk . the majority of observed coronal loops that exhibit oscillations are reported to have a temperature decrease in an exponential form with cooling times of @xmath4 s @xcite .    propagating plasma disturbances",
    "were detected by soho / uvcs along coronal plumes ( , @xcite , @xcite ) . observed similar compressive disturbances in polar plumes by using soho / eit .",
    "these observed compressive disturbances are interpreted as propagating , slow magneto - acoustic waves , where the suggested damping mechanism for the waves was compressive viscosity ( , @xcite ) .",
    "this problem was further investigated by who considered a gravitational stratification in addition to dissipative processes of thermal conduction , viscosity and radiation .",
    "they found that oscillations are even more efficiently damped in stratified plasmas .",
    "similar intensity disturbances were observed in coronal loops by trace @xcite and eit / soho @xcite .",
    "have also identified these disturbances as slow magneto - acoustic waves and they found that the wave evolution is affected by dissipation and gravitational stratification .",
    "moreover , and have observed ( @xmath5",
    "mk ) hot loop oscillations by sumer and sxt .",
    "they suggested that these oscillations are standing longitudinal ( acoustic ) waves and are triggered by a footpoint microflare .",
    "it was reported that after an initial temperature increase the loop is observed to be cooling . recently , and have detected 5 minutes quasi - periodic oscillations in transition region and additional five coronal lines by hinode / eis at the footpoint of a coronal loop .",
    "these oscillations were interpreted as slow magneto - acoustic waves propagating upward from the transition region into the corona .",
    "further , it was found that the amplitude of oscillations decreases with increasing height .",
    "it is suggested that the source of these oscillations are the leakage of the photospheric _",
    "p_-modes through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona , i.e. a similar mechanism that is put forward to explain spicule formation @xcite and transition region moss oscillations @xcite .",
    "a theoretical study of how the slow mode under solar coronal conditions can be extracted from the mhd equations has been done by , e.g. .",
    "the magnetic field was assumed straight in the vertical direction in a gravitationally stratified medium .",
    "this theory has been applied to the slow waves in coronal loops observed by sumer and trace . generalised these studies to concurrently occurring magnetic and density stratification , i.e. taking into account the strongly expanding nature of loops that support mhd waves .",
    "the hot loops are thought to be heated by impulsive heating events , e.g. flares , micro - flares , nano - flares .",
    "the origin of these energisation mechanisms could be either waves or reconnection ( , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there have been a number of simulations investigating the evolution of coronal loops after heating events ( see , e.g. ; ; ; , @xcite ; ) .",
    "impulsive heating events only last for a relatively short duration and if the plasma reaches a hot enough temperature by the end of the heating , thermal conduction dominates the cooling of the plasma . from calculations by e.g. , the decrease in temperature due to thermal conduction takes an almost exponential form .    the effect of thermal conduction on mhd waves has been extensively studied .",
    "however , all the pervious models have assumed the background plasma is static , i.e. no change in the equilibrium plasma quantities over time . studied the propagation of thermal and magnetosonic waves in optically thin plasma .",
    "they found that thermal waves are always damped whereas the magnetosonic waves are damped in the range of temperature @xmath6 k @xmath7 k due to thermal conduction mechanism .",
    "moreover , and have used a 1d nonlinear dissipative mhd model to study the doppler shift oscillations of hot coronal loops observed by sumer .",
    "the oscillations were interpreted as slow magnetosonic waves .",
    "compressive viscosity was found to be less significant on damping loop oscillations compared to the thermal conduction mechanism .",
    "the propagation of mhd slow waves in a static 1d isothermal medium has also been studied by where thermal conduction and compressive viscosity are considered as damping mechanisms for perturbations .",
    "they found that ` enhanced ' thermal conduction is the dominant damping mechanism of slow waves in coronal loops .",
    "further to this , investigate the behaviour of slow mhd waves in a stratified and diverging static atmosphere .",
    "the introduction of stratification reduced the effectiveness of thermal conduction on the damping of the slow wave .",
    "this result is in disagreement with those of , who found an opposite effect for slow standing waves .",
    "further , there is reported a decay of oscillation amplitude by optically thin radiation and area divergence although this is only found to change the rate of damping by a few percent .",
    "overall , it is found in many earlier studies that thermal conduction is an essential cause of the damping of loop oscillations in static equilibria when compared to the other mechanisms under the coronal conditions ( i.e. @xmath8 k ) .",
    "however , there is an important point to highlight : although thermal conduction seems to be an efficient dissipative mechanism among the various damping mechanisms , considered , it can not efficiently model the _ observed _ decay of amplitudes , when coronal parameters are substituted into the classical formulae of thermal conduction obtained by and , etc .",
    "this means that modelling efforts need to consider alternatives .",
    "we provide here one .",
    "the damping of oscillations due to a cooling _ background _",
    "coronal plasma is a novel and physically natural idea",
    ". found that the cooling of the background plasma could lead to the damping of even fast kink ( i.e. by largely incompressible ) oscillations .",
    "in addition to this , they noticed that the ratio of fundamental mode to the first harmonic decreases as the loop cools .",
    "furthermore , found that the damping due to the cooling of the plasma could account for the observed damping in a number of examples of observed transverse oscillations . at the time of writing , this number was almost all the known examples available in the literature ( , @xcite ; ) . in a recent theoretical work by ,",
    "the effect of a radiative cooling background plasma state on the propagation of magneto - acoustic waves in a uniformly magnetized plasma was investigated .",
    "although the approximation of unbounded uniformity of the plasma may seem to be a severe simplification , this step was necessary in order to give insight into the underlying physics .",
    "the radiation mechanism was assumed to be the mechanism for the cooling of the plasma and the plasma cooled exponentially in time , which is capturing well the key features of the observational data . as a result",
    ", they found that the slow and fast modes are damped due to cooling .",
    "the radiative cooling was shown to damp the slow mode by up to @xmath9 within characteristic lifetimes .",
    "this effect is much stronger than the contribution predicted by and there was no need of additional , less realistic assumption about the coefficient of thermal conduction .    in this paper",
    ", we study further the propagation of longitudinal mhd waves in a uniform magnetized plasma under the influence of a cooling background state .",
    "the cooling of the plasma is assumed , here , to be dominated by thermal conduction , so is applicable to oscillations in hot loops .",
    "solutions to the background plasma equations show the cooling profile of the plasma is exponential in time in agreement with observational reports .",
    "the dispersion relation which describes the slow modes and their properties is derived . an analytic expression for the time - dependent amplitude of the waves",
    "is also derived .",
    "the results show that thermal conduction has a dominant effect on the slow modes where their amplitude is strongly damped in plasmas with a dynamic background state .",
    "the rate of damping is quantified in the model and is found to be dependent upon the amount of stratification in the plasma and the initial temperature of the background . the damping is also shown to be weakly dependent upon position along the slowly varying equilibrium .",
    "consider a homogeneous magnetised plasma where the background temperature is changing as a function of time due to thermal conduction and density is constant in time .",
    "the magnetic field is uniform and in the @xmath10 direction , i.e. @xmath11 . the governing mhd equations for the background plasma take the following form @xmath12=\\kappa\\nabla^2{t},\\\\ \\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{b}}}{\\partial{t}}=\\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{b}),\\\\ { p}=\\frac{r}{\\tilde\\mu}\\rho{t},\\label{eq : gas - law}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the flow velocity , @xmath14 is the magnetic field , @xmath15 is the gravity , @xmath16 is the magnetic permeability of free space , @xmath17 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath18 is the gas constant , @xmath19 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath20 is the temperature , @xmath21 is thermal conduction term , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the plasma density and its pressure , respectively .",

    "so as @xmath20 reaches 2 mk the damping of the longitudinal mode may not look as shown here . a full numerical simulation incorporating the variable background and the variable value of @xmath69 will need to undertaken that is well beyond the scope of the present study and may require a full numerical approach even for an initial insight because of the far to complex mathematical modelling ( e.g. generating background flows , etc . ) .    in figure [ amp - damping_k ]",
    "we show how the magnitude of the thermal conduction coefficient , @xmath177 , effects the rate of damping of the longitudinal ( acoustic ) mode . altering the value of @xmath177 by an order of magnitude leads to large changes in the rate of damping , i.e the amplitude of longitudinal ( acoustic ) wave decreases rapidly with an increasing value of @xmath177 .",
    "next , figure [ amp - damping_z ] shows how the decay of the amplitude varies for different values of @xmath178 .",
    "two values of thermal ratio @xmath179 are taken to illustrate the influence of thermal conduction on cool and hot corona , @xmath20=(1 mk , 3 mk ) , and the characteristic value of @xmath180 .",
    "this plot shows that the strength of the damping due to thermal conduction will be for all intents and purposes , the same along a loop .     at @xmath46 and @xmath180",
    "where @xmath181 mk.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath180 , and with different values of @xmath179.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "the influence of variable background on the longitudinal ( field - aligned ) mhd wave propagating in a homogeneous , magnetised plasma in a weakly stratified atmosphere has been investigated .",
    "the background plasma is assumed to be cooling as the magneto - acoustic wave propagates .",
    "thermal conduction is the dominant mechanism causing the plasma cooling and changing pressure as a function of time .",
    "the magnetic field was assumed to be constant and directed along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "a governing equation is derived under the assumption that the background plasma is cooling on a time scale greater than or comparable to the characteristic period of the perturbations . a time- and space - dependent dispersion relation that describes the propagation of the longitudinal magneto - acoustic mode is obtained and an analytic equation for the time - dependent amplitude is also derived .",
    "the effect of cooling background due to thermal conduction on the amplitude of hot loop oscillations was then studied .",
    "the governing equation in terms of time and space is solved by using the wkb theory .",
    "leading and first order equations for the dispersion relation and wave amplitude , respectively , are obtained and solved analytically . an approximate solution which represents the properties of the field - aligned acoustic wave",
    "is found with the aid of method of characteristics .",
    "numerical evaluations illustrate the behaviour of the analytic solutions . a comparison of wave behaviour for a range of initial temperatures is studied .    enhanced by the cooling background plasma , the amplitude of longitudinal ( acoustic ) waves was found to rapidly decay due to the influence of thermal conduction . the rate of damping of the oscillations",
    "was found to depend on the initial temperature of the plasma and the amount of stratification .",
    "it was previously shown that thermal conduction leads to the damping of slow mode oscillations .",
    "for example , the amplitude of slow modes in was detected to undergo damping whereas in this study the amplitude was found to experience a much stronger damping . it should be noted that reported that the damping of the slow mode was also heavy where the amplitude of wave suffers a rapid decrease due to the cooling of the background plasma by another dissipation , namely by radiation mechanism .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the magneto - acoustic oscillations of hot corona can be exposed to a strong damping because of cooling by thermal conduction while radiation is a dominant method of damping cool coronal oscillations .",
    "overall , the presented results into the study of the damping of coronal oscillation imply that both radiation and thermal conduction mechanisms should be taken into account even for background plasma as a result of their efficient effect on dominating the properties and lifetimes of mhd oscillations in cool and hot corona , respectively .",
    "the main point is that these dissipative processes introduce a dynamic plasma background .",
    "such background in often reported in observations .",
    "the mhd wave theory of dynamic plasma is in its infant stage and we argue that for an adequate modelling of the solar coronal processes such studies as consideration of dynamic plasma background in the modelling is essential .",
    "the temporal evolution of the background plasma has an extremely important effect on the properties of waves and needs to be incorporated into future models .",
    "this is especially necessary if deriving plasma parameters from magneto - seismological methods , e.g. in applications to the solar corona .",
