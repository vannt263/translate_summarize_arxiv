    "since extragalactic supernovae ( sne ) are spatially unresolvable during the very early phases of their evolution , explosion geometry has been a difficult question to approach observationally .",
    "although sne are traditionally assumed to be spherically symmetric , several pieces of _ indirect _ evidence have cast doubt on this fundamental assumption in the past decade , especially for core - collapse events . on the observational front , high - velocity `` bullets '' of matter in sn remnants ( e.g. , taylor 1993 ) , the galactic distribution and high velocities of pulsars ( e.g. , kaspi & helfand 2002 , and references therein ) , the aspherical morphology of many young sn remnants ( manchester 1987 ; see , however , gaensler 1998 ) , and the asymmetric distribution of material inferred from direct speckle imaging of young sne ( e.g. , sn  1987a , papaliolios 1989 ; see , however , hflich 1990 ) collectively argue for asymmetry in the explosion mechanism and/or distribution of sn ejecta .",
    "moreover , recent advances in the understanding of the hydrodynamics and distribution of material in the pre - explosion core ( bazan & arnett 1994 ; lai & goldreich 2000 ) , coupled with results obtained through multidimensional numerical explosion models ( burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ) , imply that asphericity may be a generic feature of the explosion process ( burrows 2000 ) .",
    "sparking even more interest in sn morphology is the strong spatial and temporal association between some `` hypernovae '' ( sne with early - time spectra characterized by unusually broad line features ; see k. maeda s contribution to these proceedings ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , galama 1998 ; iwamoto 1998 ; woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ; stanek 2003 ; hjorth 2003 ) .",
    "these associations have fueled the proposition that some ( or , perhaps all ) core - collapse sne explode due to the action of a `` bipolar '' jet of material ( wheeler , meier , & wilson 2002 ; khokhlov 1999 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , as opposed to the conventional neutrino - driven mechanism ( colgate & white 1966 ; burrows 2000 , and references therein ) . under this paradigm ,",
    "a grb is only produced by those few events in which the progenitor has lost most or all of its outer envelope material ( i.e. , it is a `` bare core '' collapsing ) , and is only observed if the jet is closely aligned with our line of sight . such an explosion mechanism predicts severe distortions from spherical symmetry in the ejecta .",
    "an exciting , emerging field is sn spectropolarimetry , an observational technique that allows the only _ direct _ probe of early - time sn geometry . as first pointed out by shapiro & sutherland ( 1982 ; see also mccall 1984 ) , polarimetry of a young sn is a powerful tool for probing its geometry .",
    "the idea is simple : a hot young sn atmosphere is dominated by electron scattering , which by its nature is highly polarizing . indeed ,",
    "if we could resolve such an atmosphere , we would measure changes in both the position angle and strength of the polarization as a function of position in the atmosphere . for a spherical source that is unresolved , however , the directional components of the electric vectors cancel exactly , yielding zero net linear polarization . if the source is aspherical , incomplete cancellation occurs , and a net polarization results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . in general ,",
    "linear polarizations of @xmath0% are expected for moderate ( @xmath1% ) sn asphericity .",
    "the exact polarization amount varies with the degree of asphericity , as well as with the viewing angle and the extension and density profile of the electron - scattering atmosphere ; through comparison with theoretical models ( e.g. , hflich 1991 ) , the early - time geometry of the expanding ejecta may be derived .",
    "in addition to bulk asymmetry , a wealth of information about the specific nature of the implied asphericity can be gleaned from a detailed analysis of line features in the spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , leonard & filippenko 2001 ; leonard 2000a , 2001 , 2002a ; kasen 2003 ) .",
    "largely due to the difficulty of obtaining the requisite signal for all but the brightest objects , the field of sn spectropolarimetry remained in its infancy until quite recently .",
    "indeed , prior to our recent efforts and those of a few other groups , spectropolarimetry existed only for sn 1987a in the lmc ( see jeffery 1991 and references therein ) and sn 1993j in m81 ( tran 1997 ) .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically in the last 5 years .",
    "detailed spectropolarimetric analysis now exists for more than a dozen sne ( leonard 2000a , b , 2001 , 2002a , b ; leonard & filippenko 2001 ; howell 2001 ; kasen 2003 ; wang 2001 , 2003 ) , and the basic landscape of the young field is becoming established .",
    "the fundamental result is that asphericity is a ubiquitous feature of young sne of all types , although the nature and degree of the asphericity vary considerably .",
    "here we review the spectropolarimetric characteristics of sne , concentrating on observations made by our team at uc berkeley ; data obtained by the texas ( austin ) group are discussed by lifan wang and others in these proceedings .",
    "it is important to first note that a difficult problem in the interpretation of all sn polarization measurements is proper removal of interstellar polarization ( isp ) , which is produced by directional extinction resulting from aspherical dust grains along the line of sight that are aligned by some mechanism such that their optic axes have a preferred direction .",
    "the isp can contribute a large polarization to the observed signal .",
    "fortunately , isp has been well studied in the galaxy and shown to be a smoothly varying function of wavelength and constant with time ( e.g. , serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ; whittet & van breda 1978 ) , two properties that are not characteristics of sn polarization . this has allowed us to develop a number of techniques that confidently eliminate isp from observed sn spectropolarimetry .",
    "for example , the galactic component can be quantified with observations of distant , intrinsically unpolarized galactic `` probe stars '' along the line of sight to the sn , while limits on the host - galaxy component can be estimated from the observed reddening of the sn .",
    "alternatively , one may assume specific emission lines or spectral regions to be intrinsically unpolarized , and derive the isp from the observed polarization at these wavelengths .",
    "improperly removed , isp can increase or decrease the derived intrinsic polarization , and it can change `` valleys '' into `` peaks '' ( or vice versa ) in the polarization spectrum .",
    "since it is so difficult to be certain of accurate removal of isp , it is generally ( but not always ) safest to focus on ( a ) temporal changes in the polarization with multiple - epoch data , ( b ) distinct line features in spectropolarimetry having high signal - to - noise ratios , and ( c ) continuum polarization unlike that produced by dust .",
    "we will show near the end of this paper , however , that technique ( c ) can be risky , since dust with unusual properties may be the true cause of observed polarization .",
    "we have found that type iin supernovae ( sne  iin ; i.e. , dominated by relatively narrow hydrogen lines  see filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) tend to be highly polarized .",
    "one of our earliest and best - studied examples is sn 1998s , a sn  iin in which the progenitor star had lost most , but not all , of its hydrogen envelope prior to exploding . immediately after exploding , an intense interaction ensued between the expanding ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "we combined one early - time ( 3 days after discovery ) keck spectropolarimetric observation with total - flux spectra spanning nearly 500 days to produce a detailed study of the sn explosion and its csm ( leonard 2000a ) .",
    "the high s / n polarization spectrum is characterized by a flat continuum ( at @xmath3% ) with distinct changes in polarization associated with both the broad ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) and narrow ( @xmath6 km s@xmath5 ) line emission seen in the total - flux spectrum .",
    "the very high intrinsic polarization implies a global asphericity of @xmath7 ; the line profiles favor a ring - like geometry for the circumstellar gas , generically similar to what is seen directly in sn 1987a , but much denser and closer to the progenitor in sn  1998s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "another sn  iin with high polarization is sn  1997eg , for which we obtained three epochs of spectropolarimetry over a three - month period shortly after discovery ( nakano & aoki 1997 ) .",
    "although different in detail , the basic spectral characteristics of this sn  iin most closely resemble those of sn  1988z ( stathakis & sadler 1991 ) , with narrow ( unresolved , fwhm @xmath8 km s@xmath5 ) , intermediate ( fwhm @xmath9 km s@xmath5 ) , and broad ( fwhm @xmath10 km s@xmath5 ) line emission lacking the p - cygni absorption seen in more normal type ii events dominating the spectrum .",
    "there are clear changes in both the magnitude ( by * @xmath0% * ) and position angle of the polarization across strong spectral lines ( e.g. , @xmath11 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) in all three epochs , and the overall continuum level of polarization changes by @xmath12 over the three months of observation . both of these results argue for at least a 1% polarization intrinsic to the sn , although the polarization could be produced in part by an interaction of sn ejecta with an asymmetric csm .",
    "it appears that sne  ii - p are not polarized much , at least shortly after the explosion .",
    "examples include sne  1997ds and 1998a , which show little if any evidence for intrinsic polarization ; the weak line and continuum features are probably partly ( or mostly ) due to isp ( leonard & filippenko 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the massive , largely intact hydrogen envelopes of the progenitors of sne  ii - p are essentially spherical at the time of the explosion .",
    "however , for sn 1999em , an extremely well - observed sn  ii - p for which rare , multi - epoch spectropolarimetry exists , we find that the polarization increased with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , implying a substantially spherical geometry at early times that perhaps becomes more aspherical at late times when the deepest layers of the ejecta are revealed .",
    "as we will see in the next sections , there is also evidence for large polarizations in sne that have lost much of their envelope prior to exploding . both lines of evidence suggest that the deeper we peer into core - collapse events , the greater the asphericity .    the lack of evidence for early - time large - scale departures from spherical symmetry of sne  ii - p is encouraging for the use of this class of objects as extragalactic distance indicators through the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; eastman , schmidt , & kirshner 1996 ; leonard 2002c , d ; see also leonard 2003b ) , since this technique relies on the assumption of a spherically symmetric flux distribution during the early stages of development ( i.e. , the plateau phase ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry of sne  ii - p therefore provides a critical test of the cosmological utility of these events , which the small number of sne  ii - p observed thus far have passed .",
    "sne  iib are believed to be core - collapse sne in which the progenitor lost much of its hydrogen envelope through winds or mass transfer to a companion star ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "the best - studied case is sn 1993j : tran ( 1997 ) found a continuum polarization of @xmath0% a month after the explosion .",
    "more importantly , they showed that its polarized - flux spectrum resembles the total - flux spectra of sne  ib , with prominent he  i lines !",
    "the data are consistent with models in which the polarization is produced by an asymmetric he core configuration of material .",
    "trammell , hines , & wheeler ( 1993 ; see also hflich 1995 , hflich 1996 ) also found that sn 1993j was polarized and intrinsically asymmetric , although their derived level of interstellar polarization differed from that derived with the more extensive data set of tran ( 1997 ) .",
    "a subsequent sn  iib ,",
    "sn 1996cb , showed substantially similar polarization of its spectra ( wang et al .",
    "this was unanticipated ; the polarized flux spectra are expected to depend on the viewing angle , which should be random .",
    "most recently , preliminary analysis of keck spectropolarimetry of sn  iib 2003ed about 1 month after explosion yields similar results : leonard , chornock , & filippenko ( 2003a ) find an average continuum polarization of about 1% , with strong modulations across the h@xmath13 and ca  ii near - ir triplet features of up to @xmath0% in the individual stokes parameters .",
    "while some of the continuum polarization may be due to interstellar dust , the changes across the line features suggest substantial polarization due to scattering by aspherical sn ejecta , as had been inferred for sn 1993j and sn 1996cb .",
    "the texas group identified a trend , largely through broad - band polarimetry , that the percent polarization increases along the sequence sn",
    "ii - p to iib to ib to ic ( reddy , h0flich , & wheeler 1999 ; wheeler 2000 ; wang 2001 ) .",
    "our group ( leonard & filippenko 2001 ; leonard 2001 , 2002a , b ) confirmed this with more objects using spectropolarimetry .",
    "certainly sne  iib exhibit higher polarization than sne  ii - p , as discussed above .",
    "a very exciting recent object is the peculiar , `` sn 1998bw - like '' sn  ic 2002ap ( gal - yam , ofek , & shemmer 2002 ; mazzali 2002 ; filippenko 2003 ; foley 2003 ) , which permitted analysis of the collapse of a `` bare core '' and provided several critical tests of the `` jet - induced '' sn explosion model .",
    "our two epochs of keck spectropolarimetry ( leonard 2002a ) both show strong evidence for intrinsic polarization , whose character changed dramatically with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , as first noted by kawabata ( 2002 ) , the intrinsic polarized - flux optical spectrum is similar to the total - flux optical spectrum redshifted by @xmath14 during our first epoch , which may indicate that much of the polarized continuum at early times results from scattering off of electrons in a relativistic jet of material emitted from the sn during the explosion .",
    "another prediction of jet - induced sn explosion models is that intermediate - mass and heavy elements such as iron are ejected ( at high velocity ) primarily along the poles whereas elements synthesized in the progenitor ( e.g. , he , c , ca , o ) are preferentially located at lower velocities near the equatorial plane in the expanding ejecta ( maeda 2002 ; khokhlov & hflich 2001 ) . from a careful study of both the temporal and spectral changes of the polarization angle",
    ", we find observational evidence supporting a true difference in the distribution of ca relative to iron - group elements in the expanding ejecta ( leonard 2002a ) .    for core - collapse events ,",
    "then , it seems that the closer we probe to the heart of the explosion , the greater the polarization and , hence , the asymmetry .",
    "the small , but temporally increasing polarization of sne ii - p coupled with the high polarization of stripped - envelope sne implicate an explosion mechanism that is highly asymmetric for core - collapse events .",
    "the current speculation is that the presence of a thick hydrogen envelope dampens the observed asymmetry .",
    "thus , explosion asymmetry , or asymmetry in the collapsing chandrasekhar core , may play a dominant role in the explanation of pulsar velocities , the mixing of radioactive material seen far out into the ejecta of young sne ( e.g. , sn  1987a ; sunyaev 1987 ) , and even grbs .",
    "although the nearly unanimous consensus is that a mass - accreting white dwarf approaching the chandrasekhar limit is the progenitor of sne  ia , observational evidence for this scenario remains elusive .",
    "given a progenitor that is actively accreting material at the time of the explosion , and is likely to be part of a binary system , it seems probable that some distortion of the ejecta should exist , and lend itself to detection through spectropolarimetry .",
    "evidence for intrinsic polarization in sne  ia has been more difficult to find than for the core - collapse events , and initial investigations found only minimal evidence for polarization , @xmath15% ( e.g. , wang , wheeler , & hflich 1997 ; wheeler 2000 ) .    in the last few years ,",
    "though , significant advances have been made .",
    "leonard , filippenko , & matheson ( 2000b ) reported the first convincing , albeit weak , features in the polarization of an sn  ia , sn 1997dt .",
    "the most thorough polarization study of an sn  ia was conducted by howell ( 2001 ) : the subluminous sn  ia 1999by exhibits a change in @xmath16 by @xmath17% from 4800    to 7100   , consistent with an asphericity of about 20% observed equator - on . however , the unusual ( subluminous ) nature of sn 1999by still left some doubt about intrinsic polarization in _ normal _ sne  ia .    that doubt has recently been put to rest , with the work of wang ( 2003 ) and kasen ( 2003 ) on sn 2001el . similar to sn 1999by , after subtraction of the isp , the percent polarization increases from blue to red wavelengths in spectra obtained 1 week before maximum brightness",
    "however , the extraordinary feature here is the existence of distinct high - velocity ca  ii near - ir triplet absorption ( @xmath18 = 18,00025,000 km s@xmath5 ) in addition to the  normal \" lower - velocity ca  ii feature . a similar , but much weaker",
    "such feature had been previously observed in sn 1994d , and perhaps in other sne  ia as well ; the number of pre - maximum spectra covering the near - ir spectral range is small .",
    "the polarization is seen to increase dramatically in this feature , which kasen ( 2003 ) interpret in terms of a detached clumpy shell of high - velocity material that partially obscures the underlying photosphere and causes an incomplete cancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light , giving rise to the polarization peak . from a detailed study of the continuum polarization of @xmath190.2% in sn 2001el ,",
    "wang ( 2003 ) conclude that the continuum - producing region itself likely has an axis ratio of about 0.9 .",
    "our group obtained maximum - light spectropolarimetry of the sn  ia 2002bf using the keck - i telescope .",
    "this supernova is characterized by uncharacteristically large photospheric velocities ( filippenko 2002 ) , with no obviously detached high - velocity components , although it remains to be seen if it was in any other way peculiar .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the total - flux spectrum and the percent polarization near maximum light .",
    "there is a large increase in polarization in the photospheric ca  ii near - ir trough , in which the polarization increases from almost zero to about 2% , which is actually similar behavior to what was seen in the sn  ic 2002ap discussed earlier ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "when interpreted in terms of the simple geometric dilution model used for sn 2002ap , this polarization increase would imply a global asphericity of at least 15% ; however , as we have seen from kasen ( 2003 ) , other interpretations are possible that might not need to resort to global asphericity , including clumpy ejecta .",
    "on one of our latest keck runs , in may 2003 , we observed the sn  ia 2003du , and preliminary reductions of the spectropolarimetry show it to be similar to sn 2002bf .",
    "the continuum polarization slowly rises from blue to red , increasing from 0% to about 0.2% , and there are modulations across both the si  ii 6350 and ca  ii near - ir features .",
    "thus , from these studies , we can conclusively say that at least some sne  ia are intrinsically polarized . however , this field is still very much in its infancy , and more work , especially of the theoretical sort , needs to be done to gain confidence in the interpretations of the growing database of empirical data .",
    "we have not yet seen clear evidence for binarity of the sn  ia progenitors , which is puzzling .",
    "a rich byproduct of supernova spectropolarimetry is the ability to study fundamental properties of the interstellar dust in external galaxies , a research area with notoriously few direct observational diagnostics .",
    "the degree of polarization produced for a given amount of extinction ( or reddening ) is referred to as the `` polarization efficiency '' of the intervening dust grains . through study of the polarization of thousands of galactic stars ,",
    "an upper bound on the polarization efficiency of galactic dust has been derived ( serkowski et al . 1975 ) :",
    "@xmath20 . our observations of the type  ii - p sn  1999gi ( leonard & filippenko 2001 ) resulted in the discovery of an extraordinarily high polarization efficiency for the dust along the line - of - sight in the host galaxy , ngc  3184 : isp@xmath21 ( leonard 2002b ) . this is more than three times the empirical galactic limit , strains the theoretical mie scattering limit ( @xmath22 ; whittet 1992 ) , and represents the highest polarization efficiency yet confirmed for a single sight line in either the milky way or an external galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "while the polarization properties of the dust grains along the line - of - sight in ngc  3184 are quite unusual , our analysis also revealed the average size of the grains to be quite similar to the inferred size of typical dust grains in the milky way , @xmath23 .",
    "we speculate that the very high polarization efficiency of the grains may indicate an unusually regular magnetic field in ngc  3184 or even a different dust grain alignment mechanism than has traditionally been assumed .",
