    "coronal mass ejections ( cme ) are large - scale energetic events associated with various manifestations of solar activity ( e.g. , flares , eruptive prominences , shocks ) .",
    "the correlation between the kinematics of the cmes with these different forms of solar activity has been , for several decades , a major tool to shed light into the physical mechanisms of cme development .",
    "cmes have been frequently observed in white light coronagraph images as having a so called three - part structure , consisting of a bright rim surrounding a dark void which contains a bright core @xcite .",
    "the soho / lasco and more recently stereo observations showed that cmes are consistent with a two - dimensional projection of a three - dimensional magnetic flux rope @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that the cavity , seen in white light , can be interpreted as the cross section of an expanded flux rope .",
    "@xcite gave arguments implying that at least 40% of the observed cmes have flux - rope structures .",
    "in recent years , new prominent results on cme initiation mechanisms and their early development in the low corona have arisen from euv observations with the euv imager of the stereo / secchi telescope ( euvi ; * ? ? ? * ) and from the atmospheric imaging assembly on board the _ solar dynamic observatory _ ( @xmath0/aia ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the cme formation is first characterized by slow , self - similar , expansion of slowly - rising loops , possibly triggered by a rising filament , that leads to the formation of a bubble - shaped structure within about 2 minutes .",
    "this is consistent with the transformation , by magnetic reconnection , of loops into a flux rope structure as predicted by several models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the aia multi - temperature observations have given access to detailed description of a cme namely : i ) the ejection of a plasma blob transforming rapidly into a growing hot flux rope that stretches the upper field lines ; ii ) the appearance of a y - type magnetic configuration at the bottom of the flux - rope , in which a bright thin line ( i.e. , a current sheet , cs ) extends downward ; and iii ) the shrinkage of magnetic field lines observed underneath the cme @xcite .",
    "all these above observations are consistent with the cme eruption model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model is based on a flux rope magnetic configuration overlying a photospheric polarity inversion line .",
    "this flux rope becomes unstable and erupts building up behind a cs , which convert the surrounding b - field in a new poloidal around the flux rope . in radio , the formation and development of reconnecting cs behind an erupting flux rope was imaged by the nanay radio - heliograph @xcite .",
    "cmes are frequently associated with type  ii radio bursts which are a signature of a shock formation and propagation in the corona at speeds higher than those of the alfvn speed .",
    "these bursts are generated by shocks exciting langmuir waves which decay into radio waves at the local plasma frequency and/or its harmonics ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a long debate on the physical mechanisms which generate these shocks is still ongoing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite has led to the conclusion that coronal shocks may be generated by two different mechanisms : blast - waves initiated by the plasma pressure of a flare , and piston driven shocks due to cmes .",
    "several statistical studies on the association of cmes with type  ii radio bursts can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have found that 92% of the type  ii bursts observed at 109  mhz are associated with cmes and are located near their leading edge .",
    "however , the sources of the coronal type  ii were often found to be located not in front but on the flanks of cmes , ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "coronal type  ii bursts were also often observed jointly with the occurrence of euv waves , which are large - scale , bright , wave - like disturbances visible in euv .",
    "several authors have recently taken advantage of the high cadence observations and of the simultaneous dual ( or sometimes triple ) view - points obtained with stereo / euvi , @xmath0/aia and probab2/swap @xcite instruments to study the association between cmes and euv waves ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the development of an euv wave exhibits two phases : a first phase consistent with a wave driven by the expanding flanks of the cme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a second one where the wave propagates freely . however , the physical nature of these waves and their association with type  ii bursts is still unclear and no single model can account for the large variety of euv waves observed @xcite .    to understand the nature of the shock and its association with cmes , euv waves , and flares , detailed studies of the complex morphology present in radio burst spectra are required .",
    "this complex morphology shows up , for instance , under the form of a splitting of the emission bands into two lanes @xcite , or a fragmentation and an abrupt change of their drift rates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these various morphologies are related to the characteristics of the eruption and to the properties of the surrounding corona in which the shock is propagating .",
    "in particular , the electron density and the magnetic field characterize the ambient medium , which then determine the alfvn speed .",
    "this characteristic speed is important for the formation of a shock and for the conditions under which the radio burst can be initiated .",
    "furthermore , both the coronal density and the magnetic field configuration are crucial to determine the radio burst frequency drift and its duration .",
    "while numerous studies have been realized on the origin of the shocks and their association with cmes , there are in fact a very small number of cases for which it has been possible to study such events simultaneously through radio spectra obtained on a large frequency scale , and through radio and euv images obtained with a high enough time resolution to follow their evolution in detail . to contribute to the understanding of when and where the cmes and coronal shocks are produced and how they relate to type  ii bursts and euv waves , we study here the complex morphological spectral features of a radio event observed on 06 november 2013 together with imaging euv and radio observations .",
    "the november 06 event includes two components , an eruptive jet and a cme , which interact during more than 30 min , and can be considered as physically linked . the magnetic configuration , in which eruptive jets are produced ,",
    "has already been studied with several magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , eruptive events , such as the 06 november one which was accompanied by a cme , are not frequently described in the literature .",
    "the results of the data analysis presented here take advantage from particularly favorable conditions : i ) same field of view on euv and radio instruments ; ii ) joint radio spectral ( 0.5 - 1000 mhz ) and multi - frequency imaging observations ( 150 - 450 mhz ) at high cadence ( better than 1s ) and with an high sensitivity ; iii ) a broad - band frequency spectrogram obtained by the combination of different spectrographs .",
    "we identify step by step the causes of the type  ii spectral fragmentation in relationship with the cme evolution and the ambient medium .",
    "we obtain for each step , without introducing an electronic density model or a mhd simulation , the upstream plasma density , the alfvn mach number for the shock and the magnetic strength .",
    "the end of this type  ii burst is followed , several minutes later , by a second type  ii burst of shorter duration . in the absence of imaging observations , the spectral versus time evolution would have led us to conclude to a reactivation of the original type  ii burst .",
    "we will show that this is not the case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sect : joint ] provides first a description of the observations , and then we present the data analysis which mainly includes : i ) a brief overview of the radio event properties ; ii ) the magnetic configuration of the active region and of its environment ; iii a detailed joint euv and radio analysis of the cme and of the associated type ii bursts . section  [ sect : shock ] presents the method through which the observations of the first radio type ii burst leads to an estimation of physical parameters such as the alfvn velocity , the density and the magnetic field of the ambient medium . in section  [",
    "sect : discussion ] , we discuss what we learnt on : i ) the rle of the eruptive jet and of the ambient medium for setting up the cme ; ii ) the nature of the two shocks , associated with two radio type ii bursts , which occur during the cme progression .",

    "a goes m3.8 class flare started on 2013 november 06 at 13:39 ut in the active region ( ar ) noaa 11890 ( s12 e35 ) .",
    "the flare maximum occurred at 13:46 ut and an associated coronal mass ejection ( cme ) was observed at low altitude by @xmath0/aia starting to rise at @xmath113:44:00 ut .",

    "spectral radio observations were obtained with different instruments ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) : the radio spectrograph orfees ( observation radio frequence pour letude des eruptions solaires ) which is a new radio - spectrograph located in nanay and observing between 140 and 1000  mhz , the e - callisto spectrograph at the rosse solar - terrestrial observatory ( rsto ; * ? ? ? * ) , the decametric array in nanay ( dam ; * ? ? ?",

    "this noise storm is located south east of ar 11890 , and has a negative circular polarization .",
    "we will name hereafter negative , respectively positive polarization , the polarization of the ordinary mode in a negative , entering in the photosphere ( respectively positive , going out the photosphere ) magnetic field . for the present noise storm , which is supposed to be emitted in the ordinary mode , and is located in large scale negative magnetic fields , the negative polarization is what is expected @xcite .",
    "we shall also notice that type ii and type iii radio bursts are expected to have the polarization of the ordinary mode .",
    "an overview of the development of the radio event is shown in figure  [ figure2 ] , which displays a synthetic spectrum of the event obtained by combining the data from the different spectrographs .",
    "this first radio emission is a group of decimetric ( dm ) type  iii bursts starting at 13:42:58 ut .",
    "these bursts are observed only at frequencies higher than 100  mhz and they end at 13:43:57 ut .",
    "they are followed by interplanetary ( ip ) type  iii bursts , starting around 70  mhz , approximately at the time when the cme observed by @xmath0 starts to rise .",

    "[ figure3 ] , the @xmath0/hmi magnetogram is shown ( panel a ) together with the @xmath0/aia euv image at 171   ( panel b ) . inside the eastern trailing region of negative polarity , we note the presence of an embedded small positive and parasitic polarity . using a potential field extrapolation and a three - dimensional mhd numerical simulation",
    ", @xcite showed , in a similar case , that the active region includes fan - field lines originating from a coronal null point .",
    "this structure has the shape of a dome with the null point at its top .",
    "@xcite linked the circular shape of the observed flare ribbons with the photospheric mapping of the fan - field lines .",
    "the ribbon brightening would be due to the chromospheric impact of the particles accelerated near the null point by reconnection between the field lines located just below and above the fan .    by analogy with the masson et al .",
    "event , in our case , the coronal structure is evidenced in figure  [ figure3]a and figure  [ figure3]b by , a blue dashed circle and by the red short field lines .",
    "figure  [ figure3]c displays the @xmath0/hmi magnetogram together with the potential - field source - surface ( pfss ) extrapolation @xcite using the software of @xcitederosa / pfsspack/ ] .",
    "we also note the presence of more than one embedded ( parasitic ) polarity observed in the trailing spots ; the structure might then be more complex than the one described by @xcite .",
    "a coronal loop system is also plotted in figure  [ figure3]c and figure  [ figure3]d .",
    "it is anchored in two regions of opposite polarity a and b , south - east of the active region .",
    "the eruption took place above the active region ( ar ) noaa 11890 which was classified as a @xmath3 region . the eruptive jet is first detected at @xmath1 13:41:48 ut , in the 171    channel of sdo / aia , as a thin ascending structure .",
    "a sudden brightening appears at its basis at 13:42:12 ut , resulting in an increased lateral size .",
    "the jet then shows a more complex shape with different branches visible at 13:44:37 ut , 13:47:02 ut and later ( see movie 1 ) .",
    "a brightening , visible on running differences ( see movie 2 ) appears above the main body of the jet at 13:45:36 .",
    "the jet lasts until 14:10 ut , beginning to turn and move downward after 14:00 ut , pointing toward a belt of positive magnetic polarities located south of ar 11890 .",
    "the sources of the three dm type  iii burst groups were imaged every second at different frequencies by the nrh .",
    "all of them have _ positive polarization_. such polarization means that they are emitted along magnetic field lines emerging from the photosphere . their locations , measured respectively at 13:43:06 ut , 13:48:37 ut and 13:51:12 ut , are reported , for each group , in the three direct and running difference images of sdo / aia at 171    displayed in figure  [ figure4]a .",
    "for the two last groups , because of the progression of a type  ii burst , simultaneously detected by the nrh ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) , the source locations could be determined only at frequencies higher than 150 mhz .",
    "these locations , which are nearly identical for the three groups , trace the path followed by the electron beams responsible for the type  iii radio emission ( see also figure  [ figure3]c ) . the three groups have starting frequencies higher than 1 ghz , which implies an acceleration region located low in the corona .",
    "the first group occurs soon after the sudden broadening near the base of the jet ( see figure  [ figure4]a ) , and at the time when a euv bright and compact euv source starts to be observed above the region of positive polarity near b ( see the arrow ) .",
    "some elongated thin brightenings are also observed in the same region ( see in particular movie 1 at 171    and movie 5 at 131 ) . soon",
    "after , a bright `` like - bridge shape '' appears between this bright source and the western part of the jet . it is particularly clear in the run - difference images at 131 ",
    "this observation suggests that this bridge and the euv bright source result from the reconnection between the western side of the eruptive jet and field lines anchored in this region of positive polarity .",
    "a few weaker bright points also appear near this main euv source , which suggests that other field lines undergo a similar reconnection process .",
    "this process will also accelerate the electrons responsible for the radio type iii bursts .",
    "this is consistent with the trajectory of the electron beams ( revealed by the positions of the radio sources ) which lies precisely above the euv bright source .",
    "furthermore the sign of polarization of these type iii implies that they originate above a region of positive polarity which is the case .",
    "however , we note that no field lines above this region are observed in figure  [ figure3]c on the pfss map .",
    "two successive interplanetary groups of ip type  iii bursts started respectively at 13:43:57 ut and 13:48:20 ut . the first group took place shortly after the dm - type  iii bursts .",
    "the spectrum displayed in figure  [ figure2 ] shows that both ip groups are detected at frequencies below @xmath170  mhz with the dam spectrograph .",
    "the first one was detected by the nrh at 173  mhz and 150  mhz ( but the second one was not ) .",
    "its emission measured at 150 mhz was not polarized .",
    "the two upper panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ figure5 ] show that the respective locations , at 150  mhz , of the dm and ip type  iii bursts are different .",
    "the ip burst location , which is superposed on an hmi magnetogram in panel ( c ) is quite close to the noise storm position , above the a - b coronal loop system ( defined in figure  [ figure3]c and d ) .",
    "moreover , the running - difference image at 193   ( see figure  [ figure5]d ) shows that these bursts are also concomitant with a sudden brightening , identified in the @xmath0 image at 13:45 ut , which appears on the east side of the eruptive jet , near the b foot of the a - b coronal region and persists until at least 13:48 ut .",
    "open field lines , identified in the magnetic field line extrapolation are present nearby this brightening .",
    "most of them originate in a. this set of observations leads us to propose that the electron beams , which produce the ip type  iii emission , result from the reconnection of these open field lines with the magnetic field structure of jet .      the onset of the cme rising loops at 13:44  ut ( see movie",
    "2 ) was followed , soon after , by a type  ii burst starting at 13:45:59 ut . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the relationship between the type ii progression and the cme evolution .",
    "an expanded view of the type  ii burst is presented in figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "this burst exhibits the ( f ) fundamental and ( h ) harmonic emission bands .",
    "the h band is clearly splitted in two parallel lanes . following the interpretation proposed originally by @xcite ,",
    "these two lanes are a consequence of the plasma emission of the upstream and downstream shock regions .",
    "the h component is fragmented in four main segments , highlighted by red dashed lines in figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "the positions of the upstream type ii source , measured by the nrh at different times and frequencies , are superposed in figure  [ figure7 ] on @xmath0/aia running difference images at 193   .",
    "these images display the progression of the cme .",
    "the diamond symbol indicates the position of the upstream radio source , while the location of the cme leading edge ( le ) is indicated by a dashed line ( see the figure caption for the color code of frequencies ) .",
    "we note the following sequences in the radio spectrum of the type  ii burst :    \\a ) the initial position of the upstream type  ii burst measured at 13:45:59 ut is located above the le of the cme ( figure  [ figure7]a ) .",
    "both the cme le and the upstream radio sources propagate in the south direction .",
    "the distance between the type  ii source and the cme le is increasing ; that indicates that the shock source is moving faster than the le .",
    "\\b ) at 13:47:06 ut , the dynamic spectra ( figure  [ figure6 ] ) shows an abrupt change in the drift rate of the type  ii burst , passing from 1.25 to 0.55  mhz / s ( _ end of the first segment _ ) . between @xmath1  13:47:00 and @xmath1 13:48:36 ut , the type  ii source stops its southward progression , being westward deviated ( figure  [ figure7]b , c and e ) . during the same period of time ,",
    "the shape and the orientation of the cme le are also modified ( figure  [ figure7]c , movie  4 ) .",
    "the cme le is now southward elongated and slightly westward oriented .",
    "we thus conclude that the change in the frequency drift and in the trajectory of the type ii burst coincides with the change in the orientation of the cme .",
    "moreover , these modifications occur during the same period as the bright `` like - bridge '' which connects the eruptive jet with the b region .",
    "we thus conclude that the change in the type ii burst trajectory and in the orientation of the cme result from their approach from the eruptive jet ( see figure  [ figure3]d ) which strongly affects their development .",
    "( _ end of the second segment _ ) .",
    "\\c ) after 13:48:20 ut , the type ii burst returns again at a drift rate of 1.1  mhz / s ( _ start of the third segment _ ) .",
    "there is another change of its drift rate at @xmath1  13:49 ut ( _ start of the fourth segment _ ) .",
    "it becomes @xmath1 0.2  mhz / s until @xmath1  13:51:00 ut . at this time , the type  ii emission fades and disappears from the spectrogram , marking the end of _ the fourth segment _ ( figure  [ figure7]d ) .",
    "\\d ) while the cme continues its southward progression , its lateral expansion is limited on one side by the eruptive jet and , on the other side by the neighboring ch ( figure  [ figure8 ] ) .",
    "its western edge becomes slightly westward deviated after 13:49 ut ; however , the base - difference images displayed in figure  [ figure8 ] show that its lateral expansion seems to be limited by the pressure generated by the neighboring ch and stops its westward progression at @xmath1  13:48:50 ut .    _ the second type ii burst _    type  ii burst emission reappears at 13:55:30 ut at a frequency below 90  mhz ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) , at the same time as the development of a dark feature near the western edge of the cme ( see figure  [ figure8 ] and movie 2 ) .",
    "we suggest that the dark feature and the type  ii burst have a common origin attributed to the pressure exercised by the ch on the cme edge ; it was indeed shown that , the build - up of such a compression region can be accompanied by compression waves , or shocks detected in euv and white light images @xcite .",
    "this last assumption is consistent with the western compressed shape of the cme edge observed later , at 16:48:06 ut , in lasco - c2 coronagraph ( figure  [ figurecme]b ) .",

    "the spectrogram in figure  [ figure2 ] shows the onset of an ip type  iii burst , followed a few minutes later by another group of ip type iii bursts .",
    "the latter were observed by the nrh at 150  mhz ; their locations at this frequency are indicated by two crosses reported in figure  [ figure8]d .",
    "these bursts are probably due to the interaction between the cme le ( or the jet ) and the open magnetic field lines in the polar region .    the progression of the sdo cme is later observed by lasco c2-c3 .",

    "the direction of propagation of the shock , obtained from the locations of the nrh source , is indicated in figure  [ figure7]e by the three purple segments labeled by the numbers s1-s2 , and s3 - 4 ( the direction is the same for the segments 3 and 4 ) . during the segment s1 , the shock propagates through closed loops ( see figure  [ figure3]a ) and",
    "the normal to the shock is quasi perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field . in the cases of s2 and s3-s4 ,",
    "the coronal extrapolation is too complex to establish a definitive estimate .",
    "thus , we present here the results obtained for both quasi parallel and perpendicular cases .",
    "the procedure developed by @xcite shows that one can obtain the mach number @xmath11 then the alfvn speed , if the compression ratio of the shock is determined .",
    "this ratio , _ x _ , is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the frequencies of the upper and lower bands respectively .",
    "for a low plasma parameter @xmath15 , the mach number can be written as @xmath16 for a quasi perpendicular shock . as the speed of the shock",
    ", @xmath17 is known from the nrh source , the ambient alfvn speed can then be calculated from @xmath18 .",
    "the same procedure can be used for the case of a quasi - parallel shock , in this case the mach number is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the calculated alfvn speeds for both perpendicular and parallel cases are plotted on figure  [ figureva_ma_b]b , green squares for the perpendicular case and violet for the parallel case , together with the cme le speed .",
    "the cme le reaches a super - alfvnic speed , for the perpendicular case , at a projected distance of @xmath11.2  r@xmath4 corresponding to the onset time of the type  ii shock at @xmath113:45:59 ut .",
    "this agrees with the hypothesis that the shock wave is generated by the cme le in a piston - driven scenario @xcite .",
    "the mach number obtained from the compression ratio is plotted in figure  [ figureva_ma_b]c .",
    "the initial value for the perpendicular case of @xmath20 , decreases to the final mach number of @xmath21 ; this is indicative of the shock speed approaching the local alfvn speed , at this time the type  ii burst fades and disappears from the dynamic spectra at 13:51 ut .",
    "similar but slightly lower values of the mach number are found for the parallel shock case .    in conclusion",
    ", this analysis confirms that the approximation of a quasi perpendicular approach for direction 1 looks reasonable while , no firm conclusion on the type of shock can be given for segments s2 and s3-s4 .",
    "still the results of figure  [ figureva_ma_b ] for those segments are comparable between parallel and perpendicular cases .",
    "the strength of the local magnetic field b can be also estimated from the alfvn speed using the equation : @xmath22 , where the coronal plasma density is approximately given by @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic field values are shown figure  [ figureva_ma_b]d for the perpendicular and parallel approaches .",
    "we found values for the b - field ranging from 10 gauss at the beginning of the shock at 13:45:59 ut to 5 gauss at 1.5 r@xmath4 when the type  ii burst fades at 13:51 ut .",
    "the nrh observations at different frequencies allow us to estimate the electron density at the shock location .",
    "the only assumption at this stage is that the type  ii emission is due to harmonic plasma emission .",
    "the electron density can be then estimated directly from the emitting frequency @xmath24 . the electron density obtained from the nrh frequency bands at 408 , 327 , 270 , 228",
    ", 173 and 150  mhz is plotted against the projected distance of the nrh source in figure  [ figure_extra ] .",
    "the emission of the upstream component in the low - frequency band ( ahead ) is plotted with blue diamonds , while the emission of the downstream component ( behind ) is plotted with red diamonds .",
    "this density is compared with the coronal background electron density using a 5xfold ( brown dashed lines ) and 9xfold saito ( blue dashed lines ) density model @xcite .",
    "the position of the radio source for projected distances below @xmath11.4  r@xmath4 is comparable with a dense 9xfold saito due to the presence of the active region , while at projected distances over @xmath11.4  r@xmath4 the density drops and it is comparable with a 5xfold saito .",
    "this is due to the change in direction of the radio burst source as indicated in figure  [ figure7]e .",
    "the density ` jump ' from a 9xsaito to a 5xsaito of the radio source is evident from the data ( see figure  [ figureva_ma_b ] ) .",
    "this change in density is due to the transition from the dense plasma in the closed magnetic field topology over the active region to the less dense plasma of the other neighboring closed loops structure .",
    "this change in the magnetic field topology and electron density may also indicate the reason of the sudden change of direction of the radio source .",
    "an actual estimation of the electron density along the path of the radio source ( yellow line on the inset of figure  [ figuredistance - time ] can be obtained from the 2-dimensional maps using the method described in @xcite .",
    "this method calculates the electron density from emission measure ( em ) maps derived using the @xmath0/aia s six coronal filters and the method of @xcite . the plasma electron density can be calculated from the em by estimating an effective path length of the emitting plasma along the los ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the electron density calculated using this method is plotted in figure  [ figure_extra ] with a black dashed line .",
    "the density profile is compatible with the mean density profile obtained from the nrh and spectral observations .",
    "in the present paper , we have presented an unusual event in which an eruptive jet is involved in the onset of a cme and , then , accompanies its development .",
    "first detected in euv , this event appears as a simple loop system rising in the corona , while it is later identified as a cme when observed , in white light , by soho .",
    "no euv plasmoid was detected behind the edge of the cme .",
    "the aim of this paper was to understand : i ) the role of the eruptive jet and of the ambient medium for setting up this cme ; ii ) the nature of the two shocks associated with two successive type ii bursts , which occur during the cme progression .",
    "our main findings are summarized below .",
    "\\a ) the eruption of the jet marks the beginning of the event ; this jet originates from a coronal null point above a positive parasitic polarity embedded inside the trailing negative part of the active region ( ar ) . the initiation phase occurs when a sudden brightening appears at its base and extends rapidly toward its western neighboring loops .",
    "these large scale loops , which connect the two main polarities of the ar , start to shine along their eastern leg .",
    "these observations are indicative of the beginning of a destabilization process of the loops caused by their magnetic interaction with the jet structure .",
    "\\b ) the subsequent eruptive euv and radio manifestations , preceding or accompanying the onset of the cme , occur in the vicinity of the region where the cme le is formed .",
    "the idea of a magnetic reconnection process between the outer part of the jet and the ambient medium , is confirmed by the presence of radio type iii bursts .",
    "\\a ) the first dm type iii burst group , which is followed by two other ones , coincides with the appearance of a bright narrow euv source located above a region of positive polarity .",
    "this source persists during several minutes , and subsequent weaker sources are observed in the same region .",
    "these observations suggest that the sources , from which the electron beams responsible for the type iii radio bursts originate , result from a magnetic reconnection between the western side of the eruptive jet magnetic field and the field lines anchored in this region of positive polarity .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with i ) the sudden appearance , between these two regions , of a bright bridge , particularly well observed by sdo at high temperature ; ii ) the positive polarization of the radio emission ; iii ) the trajectory of the electron beams ( note that the magnetic field lines of positive polarity are not detected by pffs ) .",
    "the ascending motion of the cme starts soon after the occurrence of the first group of type iii bursts .",
    "\\b ) during these dm bursts , two groups of interplanetary type iii bursts are also detected .",
    "the electron beams producing these bursts result from the interaction between the eastern side of the jet and the open field lines originating from a region of negative polarity .",
    "\\c ) the different following observations seem to stress the role of the erupting jet during the cme progression :    \\a ) its motion is followed by the onset of the first type ii burst .",
    "the progressions of the cme and of the burst appear to be closely connected : they follow the same direction and the type - ii burst sources are located above the front edge of the cme .",
    "moreover , approximately 1 or 2 minutes later , the source of the type ii burst stops its southward motion and becomes westward oriented , while the cme leading edge becomes also slightly westward oriented .",
    "we attribute this effect to the encounter of the eastern edge of the cme with the eruptive jet .",
    "let us further remark that : i ) its eastern edge becomes no longer discernible from the jet after their encounter ; ii ) the cme leading edge appears to be split into two parts , its eastern part corresponding in fact to the western branch of the jet , now curved and surrounding the cme .",
    "these facts are compatible with the shape of the cme as observed later .",
    "\\b ) while the cme continues its southward progression , its lateral expansion is limited , on one side by the presence of the eruptive jet , and on the other side by the pressure generated by the coronal hole .",
    "this interaction is possibly the cause of the second type ii burst which , during the same period , appears at decameter wavelengths .",
    "we note that , 2 hours later , the expansion of the cme , when observed by lasco / c2 , has remained the same .",
    "\\c ) the last ip bursts , which appear approximately at the time of the approach of the cme with the south pole , probably originate from a magnetic interaction between the cme , or the jet itself , with the open field lines of the polar region .      in this study ,",
    "the cme le and the type ii burst kinematics were compared with ambient coronal characteristics such as the alfvn speed and the b - field , in order to understand the origin of the shock and its progression .",
    "these properties were calculated without assuming any model for the coronal density and they were derived from the shock compression ratio ; the latter was obtained from the type ii split lanes , using a method described in @xcite .",
    "the cme le showed a fast initial acceleration , and already reached a super - alfvnic speed .",
    "this was subsequently followed by the production of a type  ii burst with emission lanes split in two bands .",
    "the type  ii burst also presented a fast initial acceleration leading to a speed faster than the cme le , so that they progressively separate one from the other .",
    "a shock can be a blast wave , in which the energy is supplied by a pressure pulse , or it can be driven by a cme , either in a piston - type or in a bow shock scenario @xcite . in the case of a piston shock geometry , the shock moves faster than its driving piston and the medium is confined , since it is not able to stream around the cme @xcite . in our event ,",
    "as recalled in point c - b above , the lateral expansion of the cme is limited , on one side by the presence of the eruptive jet , and on the other side by the pressure generated by the coronal hole .",
    "this confinement , together with the shock propagating faster than the cme le , strongly suggest that the shock has been driven by the cme in a piston - driven mechanism .",
    "another observation is in line with this interpretation : the type ii burst sources are located in front of the cme le and undergo the same change as the cme in the propagating direction .    the radio observational coverage by the nrh allowed us to resolve the location of the split bands of the type ii burts .",
    "we found that the two components were located ahead of the cme le and that the higher frequency lane was positioned behind the lower frequency band .",
    "this is in agreement with the @xcite interpretation of the splitting lane emission . in our scenario , the hypothetic shock wave , probably to faint to be detected in euv ,",
    "is located between the low and hi band position of the splitted lanes . @xcite and @xcite arrived to a similar conclusion , in the study of another dm - metric type ii burst which was also imaged by the nrh .",
    "we have presented the formation and development of an unusual cme as described in section 4 and summarized below .",
    "the cme resulted from the interaction of an eruptive jet with the surrounding medium .",
    "the key points are the overall magnetic structure of the ambient medium and the relative position of the jet in this environment .",
    "to our knowledge , it is the first time that such an event has been analyzed in some depth .",
    "a cluster of eruptive euv and radio observations , stress the predominant role played by the eruptive jet in the history of this cme :    first detected in euv , this event appears as a simple loop system rising in the corona .",
    "these loops start to be destabilized by their magnetic interaction with the jet .",
    "this early development of the cme does not show the signatures that could be expected from previous observations ( see introduction ) .",
    "then , a destabilization process of the loops is caused by magnetic reconnection between the outer part of the jet and the ambient magnetic field .",
    "this process occurs in the vicinity of the region where the cme le is formed and when the cme speed is strongly increasing .",
    "this is also near this time that the onset of the first type iii burst is observed .",
    "this is reminiscent of the break - out model @xcite but with reconnection between closed and open magnetic field .",
    "the progression of this cme is later observed in white light , up to a distance of 8 solar radii .",
    "two type ii bursts were detected .",
    "a distinct origin is identified for the two successive shocks , both associated with the cme development .",
    "one of the primary finding of this study is related to the first type ii burst for which the joint spectral and imaging observations allowed us :          to conclude , we would like to illustrate , on two specific points , how the data analysis has benefited from particularly favorable conditions : i ) though , the event originated on the solar disk , it was observed by the soho / lasco coronagraph .",
    "it allowed us to confirm that this event was a real cme ; ii ) the polarization measurements of the radio type iii bursts was determinant to identify the origin of the dm type three bursts and also showed that electron beams escape along magnetic field lines that were not present in pfss extrapolation .",
