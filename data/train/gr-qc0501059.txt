    "gravitomagnetic effects are perhaps the most elusive phenomena predicted by general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "these effects are originated by the rotation of the source of the gravitational field , which gives rise to the presence of off - diagonal @xmath0 terms in the metric tensor .",
    "the gravitational coupling with the angular momentum of the source is indeed much weaker than the coupling with mass alone ( gravito - electric interaction ) .",
    "considering an axisymmetric stationary configuration , we may compare the relevant terms of the metric tensor by looking at the ratio @xmath1where a polar non - coordinated basis is assumed with unit forms @xmath2 and @xmath3 . almost everywhere in the universe",
    "a weak field approximation is acceptable , hence @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius of the source , @xmath6 being its mass ; we have defined @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the source angular momentum . in the equatorial plane ( @xmath9 ) , eq .",

    "( [ epsilon ] ) at the surface of the sun ( the most favorable place in the solar system ) gives @xmath11 , thus evidencing the weakness of the gravitomagnetic versus the gravitoelectric interaction .",
    "the smallness of @xmath12 is the reason why , though having been suggested from the very beginning of the relativistic age  @xcite , the explicit verification of the existence of gravitomagnetic effects has been extremely limited so far .",
    "although a number of proposals for experimental tests of gravitomagnetism have been put forward during the past decades  @xcite , the only one presently under way is the gravity probe b ( gpb ) mission  @xcite , which is currently collecting scientific data to verify both the lense thirring and the schiff  @xcite precessions of orbiting gyroscopes .",

    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the time delay in the propagation of e.m .",
    "signals in gr .",
    "it is well known that the curvature of spacetime produces a delay in the propagation time of light with respect to a flat environment ( shapiro delay ) , a phenomenon that has been measured within the solar system @xcite .    in the presence of a rotating source , a specific gravitomagnetic contribution to the delay",
    "is also expected , which would show up as an asymmetry in the time of flight of the signals . in ref .  @xcite it was proposed to look for this effect in the vicinity of the sun . however , the magnitude of the effect is really tiny , @xmath14 s from opposite sides of the solar disk .",
    "other proposals pertain to the measurement of the frequency shift induced on e.m .",
    "signals by the gravitomagnetic field of the sun  @xcite .",
    "as we pointed out above , a more favorable situation could be expected in a compact binary system . presently , just a few of them are known  @xcite , but all are interesting laboratories for testing gr . among the known systems ,",
    "the recently discovered psr  j0737 - 3039  @xcite presents a favorable configuration and is particularly appealing also because both stars are pulsars .",
    "the data collection is going on and maybe some interesting results can be found also with respect to gravitomagnetic effects : for example , it has been recently argued that both the precession of the spinning bodies and the spin effects on the orbit could be measured in this system  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the gravitational time delay on e.m .",
    "pulses in a binary system , focusing on the gravitomagnetic contribution , and propose how its consequences could be revealed .",
    "the corresponding frequency shift is also briefly discussed .",

    "sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we shall refer to two objects , composing the binary system , with notation @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "object @xmath16 is supposed to be rotating ( e.g. a rotating neutron star ) and is then the source of the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "the other object @xmath17 ( e.g. the radio - pulsar ) plays the role of the source of e.m . beams .",
    "thus , we shall focus on time - delay observed on the e.m .",
    "signals emitted by @xmath17 when they experience the field generated by @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we shall consider observers that are far away from the source of the gravitational field , so that they do not feel its effects , e.g. earth - based observers . in this case",
    ", the coordinate time corresponds to the proper time measured by the observers .",
    "the derivation of the expressions relative to such a configuration relies on some standard assumptions , listed from _ i _ ) to _ vii _ ) in the following .",
    "_ i _ ) we choose cartesian coordinates , whose origin is located on the mass which is the source of the gravitomagnetic field ( i.e. , object @xmath18 ) : the @xmath19-axis is aligned with the direction of the angular momentum @xmath20 of the source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , the @xmath21-axis is orthogonal to the line of sight from earth and the @xmath22-axis is orthogonal to both ; we shall refer to @xmath23 as to the `` gravitomagnetic '' reference frame .",
    "consequently , the line element reads @xmath24    _ ii _ ) the gravitational field is in any case weak enough to admit the approximation ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 @xmath27    _ iii _ ) the trajectory of light rays is assumed to be a straight line .",
    "actually , there is a bending , whose effects are usually assumed to be negligible  @xcite , .. the deviation angle is in turn proportional to the ratio between the mass of one of the stars and the impact parameter , which gives in practice a quadratic factor in the order of @xmath28 ; _ b _ ) the relevant quantity is the interval between two consecutive pulses from the source . the influence of the bending would depend on the change of the deviation angle during one period of the signal . in practice , this change introduces another factor @xmath29 or less .",
    "the final impact is then less then one part in @xmath30 ; _ c _ ) the effect due to the mass is symmetric with respect to conjunction , then it is irrelevant for gravitomagnetic contributions ; _ d _ ) there is an anisotropy in the deviation angle too , but this effect is smaller than the very deviation . ]    _ iv _ ) the center of mass of the system is at rest with respect to the observer on earth .    _",
    "v _ ) the orbit of the source of the signals ( i.e. , object @xmath31 ) around the center of mass of the system is circular .    _ vi _ )",
    "the size of the binary system is much smaller than the distance from the observer on earth .",
    "_ vii _ ) as a result of the proper motion of object @xmath32 , the origin of the reference frame is moving with respect to the center of mass of the system and then with respect to the observer .",
    "however , we shall assume that this motion is slow enough not to appreciably change the expression  ( [ metrica ] ) of the metric .",
    "in practice , from the viewpoint of the observer , the propagation of light through the system is described as a series of static snapshots .    under these conditions",
    ", we identify the position of the source of the signals with the space coordinates @xmath33 and that of the observer with @xmath34 . according to hypothesis",

    "( [ tof ] ) is divided into four terms , which may be further grouped into three contributions to the total time of flight as @xmath49 where @xmath50represents the pure geometric term , @xmath51is the mass delay up to second order , where we have defined @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; the contribution due to the angular momentum of the source reads @xmath54 the quantity @xmath55 changes sign if the e.m .",

    "the mass - dependent term is more involved , since it is composed by a first order and a second order term .",
    "both of them can be factorized into an `` amplitude '' , containing the size of the system and the schwarzschild radius of @xmath16 , and a pure geometrical part .",

    "since the geometric and mass terms are symmetric with respect to conjunction and opposition , whereas @xmath56 is antisymmetric , for @xmath98 we have @xmath99 i.e. , in seconds @xmath100 the function @xmath101 is shown in fig .",

    ", we obtain @xmath114 since @xmath115 , the denominator never vanishes , so that the amount of the effect is at most @xmath116 s. this configuration is thence less favorable than the previous one , because a lower detectability threshold is required .",
    "let us consider the fourier spectrum of an e.m .",
    "beam propagating into a gravitational field : the time - delay effect we have discussed so far corresponds , in the frequency domain , to a frequency shift of each harmonic component of the signal .",
    "since the period @xmath117 of each harmonic is much shorter than all the other characteristic time - scales of the system , we can write its relative change in period , hence in the frequency @xmath118 , as @xmath119 where the overdot stands for derivative with respect to the coordinate time . for each contribution , we have @xmath120where @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ orbita1 ] ) .",
    "here it becomes clear that the relative frequency shift is a complicated function of time that reads out as a periodic modification in the frequency spectrum of the signal .    applying the above equations to our psr j0737 - 3039-like system , we just present results for pulses emitted by star a. in this case , we have @xmath124 where the coefficients @xmath125 , with @xmath126 , give the order of magnitude of the effect and are listed in table  [ label : table2 ] .",

    "in this paper , we have discussed the effects of the gravitational interaction on the time delay of electromagnetic signals coming from a binary system composed by a radio - pulsar and another compact object . in particular",
    ", we have evidenced that the behavior of the gravitomagnetic contribution , near the occultation of the radio - pulsar by its companion , is antisymmetric while the geometric and mass contribution are symmetric , thus suggesting a possible way for decoupling the effects .",
    "the recently discovered binary pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 , lends itself for the study of the time delay , because ( i ) the orbital plane almost contains the line of sight , ( ii ) the star b eclipses a and ( iii ) the spin axis of b seems to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "however , we have argued that the gravitomagnetic effect on time delay still remains extremely small in this system : under reasonable assumptions on the mass and angular momentum of the sources of the gravitational field , the possibility to reveal the effect critically depends on the configuration of the system and on the minimum impact parameter achievable for the e.m . ray . because of the existence of a large opaque region represented by a magnetosheath surrounding psr j0737 - 3039b , the effective impact parameter is much bigger than the actual linear dimension of a neutron star , so that the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic time delay is smaller than a reasonable detectability threshold .",
