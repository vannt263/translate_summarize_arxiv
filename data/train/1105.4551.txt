    "one of the most prominent hallmarks of the existence of massless dirac fermions in monolayer graphene was the experimental discovery of an unusual quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "in other words , the observation of the landau level ( ll ) pattern of the massless dirac fermions , in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , confirmed the characteristic band structure of graphene , long after its theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene ( blg ) of bernal stacking are massive and described by the following hamiltonian . for a given valley ,",
    "say @xmath10 , in the low energy continuum limit , it is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective mass of the quasiparticle in blg and we have introduced complex coordinates @xmath13 on the graphene plane .",
    "the derivative operators are defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the ll spectrum of blg is thus different from that of monolayer graphene and is given by eigenvalues of the following hamiltonian in a magnetic field @xmath7 : @xmath16 that is , by @xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the lowering / raising operators @xmath19/@xmath20 satisfy the usual harmonic oscillator algebra and are given by suitable combinations of covariant derivatives representing the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "when graphene layers stack together , the interlayer couplings significantly change the nature of quasiparticles , like the blg case considered above .",
    "surprisingly , massless dirac fermions survive the stacking in multilayer structure grown on sic @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this stunning effect is thought to be the decoupling of twisted layers @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "persistence and properties of massless dirac fermions at small twist angles are , however , under some controversy . according to _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , the decoupling occurs at any values of twist angle and massless dirac fermions are essentially those of monolayer graphene . on the other hand ,",
    "the tight - binding analysis @xcite indicates a strong role played by the interlayer coupling , which considerably affects the nature of quasiparticles .",
    "these results are based on the band structure calculation in the absence of magnetic field . in a recent experiment @xcite , the issue of angle dependence of the ll s in the presence of magnetic field",
    "is addressed by combining scanning tunneling microscopy and ll scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "they measured some critical angles at which two - fold degeneracy due to the presence of two massless dirac fermions is lifted and where the massless dirac fermion picture breaks down .",
    "specifically , the degeneracy can be seen at angles above roughly @xmath0 for a few low levels in the magnetic field of 10 t , and the critical value of twist angle below / above which massive / massless ll spectrum is shown is @xmath21 for 10 t .",
    "an effective hamiltonian to obtain the corresponding ll s is suggested recently , but only the zero - modes are analytically investigated @xcite . in order to study the angle dependence we should have controls over the nonzero - modes .    in this paper",
    ", we exactly solve the ll spectrum of the hamiltonian proposed in @xcite to give the concrete values of angles , which show very precise agreements with the measured values for the magnetic field 10 t @xcite .",
    "since the ll spectrum is obtained in analytic form , we can predict @xmath22 and @xmath23 for every nonzero pair of the ll s in the presence of arbitrary constant magnetic field ( under a plausible assumption on the physical continuity of the ll spectrum as functions of twist angle about which we discuss in appendix[appa ] ) . furthermore , our analytic result for ll s smoothly interpolates between the spectra known before for massive / massless quasiparticles in blg , and allows one to get systematic power series corrections for both of two sides of the spectrum .",
    "a natural question one can ask here is : `` what is the symmetry restoration mechanism behind the transition between the massive / massless spectra ? '' based on our exact results , we anticipate that the non - perturbative symmetry restoration mechanism is a tunneling ( instanton ) in the momentum ( reciprocal ) space @xcite .",

    "the summation in the interlayer coupling term in runs over these three types of the coupling matrices and the other components are suppressed . due to this interlayer coupling",
    ", there is a slight difference of @xmath54 mev order between the energies associated with each dirac points but this second - order effect in perturbation is negligible . assuming a simplified interlayer coupling under the condition @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the fermi speed in the monolayer graphene ) , @xmath57 one can obtain an effective two - band hamiltonian which resembles @xmath58 where @xmath59 is @xmath24-dependent effective mass due to the @xmath24-dependent @xmath49 . in the multiplication by 3 mimics the summation over three possible crystal momentum @xmath60 , and another factor @xmath61",

    "the period of the superlattice is infinite and the summation over @xmath60 is overcounting since @xmath63 .",
    "thus the multiplication by 3 in should be disregarded in this case and the interlayer coupling becomes that of the bernal - stacked blg : @xmath64 then the effective hamiltonian goes to . since @xmath65 is proportional to twist angle @xmath24 , the two - band approximation made here is restricted to be applicable for very small angles only .",

    "the dirac - point splitting also happens in untwisted bernal - stacked blg by the effect of external magnetic field which is parallel to the graphene plane @xcite .",

    "this simple observation means that the ll spectrum of twisted blg with @xmath159 can not be pushed to `` massive region '' , unless a very strong magnetic field is applied .",
    "let us explain this point in more detail . as the twist angle increases the van - hove energy , playing the role of a barrier between the two dirac points , also increases as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : validity ] ( b ) .",
    "therefore the `` tunneling '' between the two dirac points is suppressed and the @xmath160 symmetry is broken .",
    "unless a very strong magnetic field is applied , the broken symmetry can not be restored and the spectrum is described by two massless fermions degenerate in energy , for @xmath159 .",
    "this fact is clearly shown in fig .  [",

    "the renormalized fermi speed according to and ( see also the caption of fig .  [",
    "fig : band ] ) is , to the first order in @xmath169 , linear in @xmath146 : @xmath170 all these circumstances make it plausible that the spectra and are smoothly connected in the intermediate range of @xmath146 ( or @xmath24 ) and , here comes the punchline , the curves representing the renormalized fermi speed for these two cases are almost tangent to each other , at the angle @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the linear function @xmath173 which is exactly tangent to the curve @xmath174 is @xmath175 .",

    "recall that the values of @xmath155 predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] are independent of the ( renormalized ) fermi speed since their predictions are based only on the spheroidal eigenvalues themselves , i.e. , @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , if the discussion made in this appendix based on physical continuity of the spectrum is correct , the predicted values can remain trustable . in other words , if one can find an exact formula for renormalized fermi speed as a function of @xmath24 which interpolates the two asymptotic forms and ( equivalently the modulation function @xmath101 ) , the exact ll spectrum is given by the spheroidal eigenvalues modulated by it , , at _ any _ values of @xmath24 .",
    "thus it is extremely interesting to find such a exact interpolating function for the renormalized fermi speed .",
    "a final remark is in order . since the validity of the asymptotic form is uncertain in the intermediate region , the slope in the other asymptotic form is also uncertain accordingly .",
    "still the inclusion of the factor @xmath178 in seems crucial , because otherwise the slope in must be modified into a too large number to have a chance of smooth interpolation .",

    "actually , the interlayer coupling matrix @xmath181 approximates each of the coupling terms in much more closely , as one can see by performing the diagonalization of after turning off the block diagonal dirac hamiltonians .",

    "<S> in the context of the low energy effective theory , the exact landau level spectrum of quasiparticles in twisted bilayer graphene with small twist angle is analytically obtained by spheroidal eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dependence of the landau levels on the twist angle to find the points , where the two - fold degeneracy for twist angles is lifted in the nonzero modes and below / above which massive / massless fermion pictures become valid . in the perpendicular magnetic field of 10 t </S>",
    "<S> , the degeneracy is removed at @xmath0 for a few low levels , specifically , @xmath1 for the first pair of nonzero levels and @xmath2 for the next pair . </S>",
    "<S> massive quasiparticle appears at @xmath3 in 10 t , which match perfectly with the recent experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> since our analysis is applicable to the cases of arbitrary constant magnetic fields , we make predictions for the same experiment performed in arbitrary constant magnetic fields , e.g. , for @xmath4 t we get @xmath5 and the sequence of angles @xmath6 for the pairs of nonzero energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry restoration mechanism behind the massive / massless transition is conjectured to be a tunneling ( instanton ) in momentum space . </S>"
