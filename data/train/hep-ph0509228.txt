    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite has been playing a central role in the quest for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . since phenomenological consistency requires susy to be broken , and broken softly ( so as not to reintroduce any quadratic divergence ) , the lagrangian of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite includes soft and gauge invariant susy breaking terms . while the generic mssm lagrangian may contain many arbitrary soft terms , specific models for susy breaking",
    "have been proposed that provide relationships between the mssm parameters . incorporating well - motivated new interactions and particles at high mass scales",
    ", such scenarios drastically reduce the large number of unknown parameters in the mssm to only a few , thereby making the model more predictive .",
    "we will focus here only on supergravity ( sugra)@xcite type of models where susy is considered as a local symmetry .",
    "these models incorporate a hidden sector wherein susy is broken , and a visible sector where the mssm fields reside and to which the breaking is communicated by gravitational interactions . in @xmath4 sugra , which incorporates grand unification , one has a choice of three functions in building a model@xcite , namely the gauge kinetic energy function @xmath5 , the khler potential @xmath6 , and the superpotential @xmath7 , where @xmath8 refer to matter fields . in msugra , the minimal version of the model , one has a flat khler potential and a flat gauge kinetic energy function .",
    "the corresponding soft susy breaking sector is characterized by only a few parameters , normally specified at the scale of the grand unified theory ( gut ) viz .",
    "@xmath9  gev@xcite .",
    "these are the universal gaugino mass @xmath10 , the universal scalar mass @xmath11 , the universal trilinear coupling @xmath1 and the universal bilinear coupling @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to these , there is a superpotential parameter , namely the higgs mixing term @xmath13 . unlike in the sm , where the breaking of the electroweak symmetry necessitates the explicit introduction of a negative valued scalar mass - squared , in a generic sugra model , the said breaking can be realized even for a positive mass - squared term in the bare lagrangian , thanks to radiative corrections@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the renormalization of the soft susy breaking terms as one moves from the unification scale down to the electroweak scale automatically engenders a negative mass - squared thereby breaking the symmetry@xcite . in a similar vein",
    ", the low energy parameters of the mssm ( which are quite large in number ) are obtained from only a few unification scale parameters via the renormalization group equations ( rge)@xcite integrated from @xmath14 to the electroweak scale ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the two minimization conditions for the higgs potential then eliminate @xmath13 ( except for its sign ) on the one hand , and , on the other , relate @xmath12 to @xmath16  ( @xmath17 ) , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "thus msugra may be characterized by @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 and sign(@xmath19 ) and @xmath1 follows the standard convention of ref@xcite . ] . with all the low energy parameters of the mssm",
    "being generated in terms of these few parameters , one has a considerable amount of predictivity for the mssm spectrum .",
    "a different problem remains though , namely that of the susy cp violating phases .",
    "many phases of sugra models can be rotated away . in an universal scenario like msugra",
    ", the gaugino masses can be considered real with the result that only two combinations of phases ( beyond the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing ( ckm ) phase already present in the sm ) are physical . a convenient choice for the two is given by @xmath20 for @xmath1 ( at @xmath14 ) and @xmath21 for the @xmath0-parameter at the electroweak scale .",
    "it should be noted though that many analyses prefer to work with @xmath22 , the phase of @xmath19 , instead of @xmath21 .",
    "an advantage of this latter choice is that @xmath23 since @xmath22 does not run up to the one - loop level .",
    "these different descriptions can be understood in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25  ( peccei - quinn ) symmetries and the choice of reparametrization invariant combinations of phases , a discussion of which may be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "a selection of past analyses using @xmath21 as an input parameter may be seen in refs.@xcite . here",
    "we note that a choice of @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 as a phase parameter makes the entire set of input parameters to be of soft - breaking origin .    a few important points need to be noted in the context of the susy cp problem .",
    "the latter arises from the fact that the phases are highly constrained by the experimental limits on the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the electron and the neutron@xcite .",
    "consequently , we are forced to admit one of the three eventualities :    1 .",
    "the phase @xmath21 is very small@xmath26 or @xmath27if the superpartners are not considered to be very heavy may reach up to @xmath28 in the focus point zone@xcite . ] .",
    "in addition , the phases of the @xmath29-parameters at the electroweak scale are also constrained . in msugra with phases ,",
    "the requirement of having a very small @xmath21 typically translates into a relatively large but _ highly fine - tuned _ value for @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath0 at @xmath14 ) .",
    "this , in turn , constrains the phase @xmath20 of @xmath1 , although to a somewhat lesser degree . the fact that the issue of fine - tuning in phases at the gut scale arises out of the combined requirement of satisfying the edm constraints and the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking was discussed in great detail in refs.@xcite as well as in refs.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we try to focus our attention on this problem by looking at suitable models beyond msugra that can have unique features in the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   the phases are large and less fine - tuned but the sparticles are massive .",
    "of course , fully ameliorating the susy cp problem in this fashion requires that the sfermions be super - massive , thereby aggravating the problem of the little mass hierarchy in the higgs sector .",
    "we will investigate whether the amount of fine - tuning can be reduced even while one considers a lighter sparticle spectra .",
    "3 .   finally there is the possibility that the susy breaking parameters may have special pockets where there can be a large amount of internal cancellations between the diagrams contributing to the electric dipole moments of electron and neutron@xcite .",
    "this means that phases could be large while sparticle masses are significantly light .",
    "this scenario is highly parameter dependent and clearly depends on very delicate cancellations .",
    "hence we will not include this in our work while trying to focus on generic behaviors .    as mentioned above",
    ", we would like to address the first and the second issues in this analysis .",
    "we are particularly interested in exploring the possible role of non - universal gaugino masses ( nugm ) in reducing the fine - tuning in the phase @xmath31 .",
    "to quantify the latter , we consider a _ naturalness like _ measure of the form = [ 0/_b]__b 0 .",
    "[ sensitivityphi ] a large value for @xmath32 would mean a lesser degree of fine - tuning of @xmath31 with respect to a variation in @xmath21 satisfying the edm constraints .",
    "the phase - derivative is evaluated at @xmath33 with the choice being dictated by the fact that the edm constraints force @xmath34 to be close to zero .",
    "thus , this is a restrictive definition compared to the type of fine - tuning defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will see that the issue of such fine - tuning of phase can be addressed by focusing on scenarios where there is a large evolution of the bi - linear higgs coupling parameter @xmath0 between the electroweak scale and the gut scale .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 depends on the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 gaugino masses , the trilinear couplings and @xmath16 . within msugra , in addition to the evolution of @xmath37 being typically small",
    ", the phase @xmath31 also turns out to be quite fine - tuned ( i.e. @xmath32 tends to be small ) .",
    "in other words , for a given @xmath31 satisfying the edm constraints , the variation @xmath38 that still is consistent with the constraints is generally much smaller than the variation @xmath39 allowed at the electroweak scale@xcite .",
    "as we will see , the evolution in @xmath37 may be enhanced by appropriate mass relationships between the gauginos that are away from universality at @xmath14 . at the same time",
    ", these would help in reducing the above - mentioned fine - tuning so that @xmath32 can be significantly increased in specific nugm scenarios .",
    "we , however , desist from choosing an arbitrary non - universal gaugino mass scenario since that will introduce new phases@xcite . as we will see in sec.[nugmdesc ] , non - universalities in gaugino masses may originate from a non - trivial gauge kinetic energy function .",
    "the latter is a function of chiral superfields and transforms as a symmetric product of the adjoint representations of the underlying gauge group .",
    "this leaves @xmath40 with the possibility of being in one or more of several representations , one of which is the singlet .",
    "while the choice of the singlet corresponds to msugra , the non - singlet representations give rise to non - universalities in the gaugino masses .",
    "it is possible to identify a suitable non - singlet representation in isolation ( _ i.e. _ , we will not combine a non - singlet representation with the singlet or other non - singlet representations ) whose gaugino mass pattern is effective in generating a large evolution in @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", there will be no additional phases to worry about since the overall phase of the gaugino masses can be rotated away in a fashion similar to that in msugra .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the consequences of a large evolution of the @xmath0-parameter ( mostly in the presence of such non - universalities ) on the cp violating phases . here , the basic input parameters are @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 ( providing with definite nugm patterns ) , @xmath41 along with its phase @xmath20 and the phase @xmath21 of @xmath0 given at the electroweak scale ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that @xmath37 at the electroweak scale is obtained via radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) condition .",
    "subsequently , @xmath42 , the gut scale magnitude of the @xmath0-parameter along with its phase @xmath31 is obtained via rges .",
    "we will identify broad but correlated regions of parameter space where there can be a significant degree of reduction of the phase sensitivity while going from msugra to a type of nugm models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[nugmdesc ] , we discuss the non - universal gaugino mass models .",
    "the study of the relevant contributions from different sectors in the associated rges of @xmath0 and @xmath29 parameters allows us to identify the non - singlet representations which provide with a large evolution in @xmath0 .",
    "we will probe the parameter space that is suitable for reducing the amount of fine - tuning in the cp violating phases . in sec.[results",
    "] , we present the numerical results for the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "an analysis in the absence of phases points us to the favored regions of parameter spaces . on inclusion of phases , this facilitates the identification of the regions with significantly reduced level of fine - tuning , finally , we conclude in sec.[secconclusion ] .",
    "non - universality in gaugino masses may originate from a non - trivial gauge kinetic energy function @xmath43 which , in turn , is a function of the chiral superfields in the theory . the indices @xmath44 run over the generators of the gauge group ( for example , @xmath45 for su(5 ) ) .",
    "the gaugino mass matrix is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47- \\kappa^2 k$ ] .",
    "here , @xmath48 is the superpotential , @xmath49 is the khler potential , @xmath50 are the complex scalar fields , and @xmath51 gev@xmath52 with @xmath53 being newton s constant",
    ". the functions @xmath43 may have non - trivial field contents , or in other words , may contain combinations of field transforming as either singlet or non - singlet irreducible representations@xcite . with the gauginos being majorana particles , @xmath43 , of necessity , must be contained in the symmetric product of the adjoint representations of the gauge group .",
    "for example , in the case of su(5 ) , @xmath54 for the singlet case , one has @xmath55 which indeed leads to universality of gaugino masses .",
    "similarly , the non - singlet representations will give rise to non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "in general @xmath56 , where @xmath57 s give the relative weights of each contributing representation and @xmath58 , for the subgroup @xmath59 , are essentially the clebsch - gordan coefficients corresponding to the breaking by the adjoint higgs field@xcite . for the case of @xmath60 , the coefficients @xmath58",
    "are displayed in table  [ tabrelativeweights ] . clearly , the non - singlet representations have characteristic mass relationships for the gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "past analyses exploring various phenomenological implications of such non - universality may be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "as we shall argue later , the adjoint representation @xmath61 for @xmath40 ( nugm:24 in the notation of table  [ tabrelativeweights ] ) is the most interesting one in the context of the present investigation .",
    "consequently , we will analyze this case in isolation , or , in other words , assume that the sole contribution to @xmath43 is from a 24-plet structure .",
    "apart from reducing the number of free parameters , this has the additional advantage that no new phase degree of freedom for the gaugino masses is introduced . with the gaugino mass ratios at the gut scale now being given by @xmath62 , for a positive gluino mass , the other two gaugino mass parameters are negative , a signature different from msugra .",
    "this indeed would turn out to be useful in our quest . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "we only consider either @xmath63 ( msugra ) or @xmath64 ( nugm:24 ) with all other @xmath57 s assumed to be zero .",

    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an analogous analysis with so(10 ) as the underlying gauge group is also possible@xcite , though we will not investigate it in this paper .",
    "similar to eq.[su5breakup ] here , one has @xmath66 .",
    "if the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath67 , one finds from the @xmath68-plet that @xmath69 .",
    "this pattern is quite similar to nugm:24 as can be ascertained from table  [ tabrelativeweights ] .",
    "we would like to comment at this point that , in general , such non - universal gaugino mass scenarios change the gauge coupling unification conditions@xcite .",
    "however , it is still possible to find specific conditions@xcite under which the usual gauge coupling unification condition remains unaltered and we consider this in our work .",
    "note though that our results are quite robust and have very little dependence on the exact details of the spectrum .",
    "we now identify the differences between msugra and nugm:24 in regard to the evolution of the @xmath0-parameter _ in the absence of cp violating susy phases_. this , in turn , will help us in understanding the evolution of @xmath21 upon the inclusion of the phases ( see refs.@xcite for past analyses discussing phase evolutions ) .",

    "i(t ) h_i(t )  .",
    "note that , in @xmath102 , the gaugino contribution is positive for msugra , but negative for nugm:24 .",
    "thus , it is useful to understand the nature of evolution of trilinear couplings in either scenario so as to evaluate their role in the evolution of @xmath0 . for the msugra case ,",
    "the gaugino contributions to @xmath103 are always negative ( vide eq.[eqnatrge ] ) .",
    "hence , it is obvious that if @xmath1 not be too large , then @xmath104 would typically turn negative by the electroweak scale . in fact , the large gluino contributions render both @xmath105 and @xmath106 negative well above the electroweak scale .",
    "this implies , that in this case ( msugra ) , the two pieces in @xmath102 would tend to cancel each other , an effect also manifested by the smallness of @xmath107 in eq.[eqnbzvsb0 ] . in turn , this leads to a small value for @xmath108 in msugra .    comparing the evolution of the trilinear terms in nugm:24 with that in msugra ,",
    "it turns out that a qualitative difference arises only in the case of @xmath109 , while for @xmath105 and @xmath106 the difference between the scenarios is only a quantitative one .",
    "this is easy to understand given the overwhelming dominance , in the last two cases , of the gluino contribution over those from the electroweak gauginos .",
    "specifically , for @xmath110 , @xmath109 at the weak scale comes to be negative for msugra while it is positive ( with usually a larger magnitude ) for nugm:24 .",
    "given the relative weights of the @xmath104 terms in eq.[eqnbrge ] , it is thus quite apparent that the total contribution from the trilinear couplings to the evolution of @xmath0 is quite similar in the two models . on the other hand , since the signs of @xmath111 are reversed in nugm:24 , the aforementioned cancellations in @xmath102 would no longer be operative ; rather , the different contributions would enhance each other leading to a large @xmath112 .",
    "this is the very reason why we choose to concentrate on models like nugm:24 .",
    "we note in passing that although the rge for @xmath0 does not explicitly include the su(3 ) gaugino mass , it implicitly depends on the latter via the contributions from trilinear couplings .",
    "we now discuss the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath12 on @xmath11 and the other parameters .",
    "being obtained from the rewsb condition of eq.[eqnbewsb ] , @xmath0 ( and hence @xmath12 ) evidently depends on @xmath11 quite strongly .",
    "the structure of eq.[eqnbrge ] suggests that , to one - loop order , @xmath112 should not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "however , a subsidiary dependence arises through the determination of the scale at which the minimizations of higgs potential ( i.e. rewsb ) is to be performed .",
    "canonically , this scale is determined by demanding that the contribution , to @xmath70 , of the 1-loop correction terms of the effective potential be small . in our analysis",
    "this scale is approximately halfway between the lowest and highest mass of the spectra and , generally , is not very far from the average stop mass scale @xmath113 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since this scale does depend on @xmath11 , it leads to a small dependence in @xmath112 as well by virtue of being a limit of integration for the rges .      even on inclusion of phases for the @xmath29 and @xmath0 parameters , the rges",
    "formally remain the same as in eqs.([eqnbrge]&[eqnatrge ] ) . the evolution of the phases",
    "can then be extracted by comparing the real and imaginary parts of the said equations . clearly , unlike in the case of the real parts , the imaginary parts of the beta functions for @xmath29 s and @xmath0",
    "do not depend on the gaugino masses and hence there is no cancellation between the different contributions .",
    "furthermore , even a vanishing @xmath31 can lead to a non - zero @xmath21 provided @xmath1 has a non - trivial phase .",
    "for example , in the small @xmath16 limit , the explicit analytical solution gives @xmath115    we examine now the interdependence between the phases , their evolution ( also see ref.@xcite ) and the phase sensitivity @xmath32 for different values of @xmath16 and other parameters both within msugra as well as nugm:24 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the edm constraints limit @xmath21 to be tiny ( @xmath116 , and typically much smaller ) .",
    "now , if either of @xmath41 or @xmath20 is small ( actually , if @xmath117 ) , then @xmath31 would be determined essentially by @xmath37 , @xmath42 and @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 would be quite unconstrained .",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 is crucial and is best understood by considering the two opposite limits , namely small and large values :    * for a small @xmath16 ( @xmath118 or so ) , @xmath119 is large , and therefore @xmath37 is appreciably large ( see eq.[eqnbewsb ] ) .",
    "within msugra , for not too large a value of @xmath41 , the gut scale value @xmath42 is then quite comparable to @xmath37 .",
    "this can be understood by recognizing the cancellations between the various terms in eq.[eqnforc ] that keeps @xmath107 small and thereby keep @xmath120 relatively small ( courtesy eq.[eqnbzvsb0 ] ) .",
    "consequently , in such a scenario , @xmath31 is not too different from @xmath21 .",
    "this remains true even for @xmath121 which maximizes the edm values@xcite .",
    "+ on the contrary , the situation in nugm:24 is quite different . here",
    ", a larger difference between @xmath37 and @xmath42 is generated by the enhancement in @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , @xmath31 becomes appreciably different from ( and numerically larger than ) @xmath21 .",
    "* for a large value of @xmath16 , on the other hand , @xmath122 is quite small .",
    "thus , unless @xmath123 is extremely tiny ( as happens , for example , in hyperbolic branch / focus point@xcite scenarios ) , @xmath37 is constrained to be small and has only sub - dominant influence on the evolution of @xmath21 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the value of @xmath31 becomes strongly correlated with that of @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , a high degree of fine - tuning in one will necessitate a similar degree of fine - tuning in the other .",
    "we now focus on the issue of phase sensitivity . as eq.[eqnbimag ] suggests , the range allowed to @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) imposes rather strong limits in the @xmath31@xmath20 plane . adopting the measure of phase naturalness @xmath32 ( as espoused in eq.[sensitivityphi ] ) , one may estimate , from eq.[eqnbimag ] , the amount of fine - tuning associated with the phase @xmath31 .",
    "now , as the rges suggest , the implicit dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath1 occurs primarily through the dependence of @xmath12 itself on @xmath1 .",
    "thus , to the leading order , one has an approximate relation of the form@xcite @xmath124 we would like to point out that although the above simplification ( as also those of neglecting @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) is quite illustrative , we do not take recourse to it .",
    "rather we solve the complete set of rges numerically and also compute @xmath32 numerically directly from its definition ( eq.[sensitivityphi ] ) .",
    "note that , as obtained from eq.[sensitivityphi ] and the first of eqs.[eqnbimag ] , the measure @xmath32 actually involves a factor of @xmath125 in the denominator .",
    "this causes @xmath32 to be very large when @xmath126 is close to @xmath127 , as also a change of sign for @xmath32 when @xmath126 crosses @xmath127 .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case for nugm:24 where @xmath126 can easily cross @xmath127 owing to a large degree of phase evolution . in the msugra scenario , on the other hand ,",
    "such a feature rarely appears .",
    "as we have already discussed , msugra is associated with a relatively small degree of evolution in @xmath0 , and hence @xmath128 .",
    "this leads to a low value of @xmath129 or , equivalently , to a high degree of fine - tuning in @xmath126 .",
    "on the other hand , a non - universal gaugino mass scenario like nugm:24 can provide us with a large evolution of @xmath37 .",
    "this , of course , can generate either @xmath130 or @xmath131 .",
    "the parameter space corresponding to the latter case ( which is typically satisfied better for smaller @xmath16 zones ) reduces fine - tuning in @xmath31 .",
    "we will see that the said reduction can be as large as a factor of 10 to 20 compared to msugra . and",
    "finally , the very same large evolution of @xmath37 also implies that @xmath132 could be a possibility within such scenarios . in nugm:24 where the evolution of @xmath0 is large",
    ", the above reduction of @xmath42 toward zero is possible when @xmath37 is large i.e. when @xmath16 is small . in msugra",
    "too this is possible , but only to a limited degree , as the aforesaid evolution is smaller in extent .",
    "so @xmath37 needs to be closer to zero in order to have a tiny @xmath42 . in this sense , a requirement of a smaller @xmath37 would then favor large values of @xmath16 for msugra .",
    "this we explore numerically in the next section .",
    "we show our numerical results in two stages . to begin with",
    ", we examine the difference between the evolution of @xmath0 in msugra and the nugm:24 scenarios in the absence of any phases . building on the lessons drawn from this exercise , we investigate",
    "next the core issue at hand , namely the behavior of the phase naturalness measure @xmath32 in each of the scenarios and the differences therein .",
    "focusing first on msugra , we begin with the value of @xmath0 as determined , by the rewsb conditions , in terms of the other parameters of the model , viz , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath133 .",
    "this study , coupled with that for the derived value at the gut scale , @xmath12 , would serve to indicate the regions of the parameter space for which the phase sensitivity can be significantly reduced .",
    "fig.[sugbgraphsa ] shows the variation of @xmath0 and correspondingly @xmath12 with respect to @xmath10 . with an illustrative choice of parameters , viz .",
    "gev , @xmath110 and @xmath135 , we exhibit our results for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "one finds that @xmath0 , determined through the rewsb condition , is almost linear with @xmath10 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath133 , on the other hand , is quite nonlinear ; but as already touched upon in the previous section , the rewsb condition implies that , for a given @xmath10 , @xmath0 decreases with increase in @xmath138 . as for the evolution of @xmath0 , we find that @xmath139 unless @xmath10 is quite large .",
    "this is reflective of the aforementioned cancellations between the gaugino and trilinear terms of eq.[eqnbrge ] in msugra . for our choice of @xmath110 ,",
    "this is same as the cancellations between the terms of @xmath107 of eq.[eqnforc ] .",
    "once @xmath10 becomes large , the contributions from the gaugino part of eq.[eqnbrge ] dominates and the cancellations are no longer as effective .",
    "this causes @xmath12 to supersede @xmath0 as is shown in fig.[sugbgraphsa ] .",
    "the information regarding the evolution of @xmath0 can also be parametrized in terms of the ratio @xmath140 and this is displayed in fig.[sugbgraphsb ] as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "this ratio is of particular interest on account of its relatively straightforward relation with the phase naturalness measure @xmath32 ( note that @xmath141 ) . as could have been guessed from fig.[sugbgraphsa ] itself , the variation with @xmath10 is nearly monotonic .",
    "the shallow dip at small @xmath10 values is a consequence of the variation in the degree of cancellation between contributions to @xmath102 and is difficult to see analytically from the leading terms alone . for large @xmath10 , the ratio @xmath140 is seen to increase with @xmath138 , while for small @xmath10 the behavior is opposite .",
    "this , within msugra , indicates that a small value of @xmath10 , coupled with a large @xmath138 seems to be best suited for achieving a low degree of fine - tuning in the phases .    in fig.[sugbgraphsc ]",
    ", we display the dependence of the same ratio on @xmath11 .",
    "while the behavior may seem intriguing at first , note that @xmath0 depends on @xmath11 only via the requirement of rewsb .",
    "as fig.[sugbgraphsa ] has already shown us , for the reference value of @xmath142 , @xmath12 is typically somewhat smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "now , @xmath0 grows smaller as @xmath11 decreases .",
    "thus , for small @xmath11 and large @xmath16 , @xmath0 can be very small and the aforesaid evolution implies that @xmath12 would have been negative . on the other hand , for large @xmath11 values , @xmath0 is large and thus the relatively small evolution leaves the ratio @xmath140 very close to unity .",
    "the dependence of @xmath140 on the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath1 is quite linear ( fig.[sugbgraphsd ] ) .",
    "this , again , can be deduced from eq.[eqnbzvsb0 ] where fixing @xmath16 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 will give rise to a linear relation between @xmath140 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that progressively larger values for @xmath138 increases the importance of the trilinear term contributions to @xmath143 , thereby increasing the slope of the curve .",
    "we now repeat the analysis for the case of nugm:24 choosing @xmath110 as before . however , since the sign of the electroweak gaugino mass parameters are now reversed , the gaugino contribution to eq.[eqnbrge ] would now enhance the trilinear contribution instead of cancelling it . and",
    "since the sign inversion affects only the sub - dominant contributions to the evolution of @xmath144 , the latter remain close to their msugra values with the result that the total trilinear contribution to @xmath102 suffers only a small relative change .",
    "the result is then a monotonic decrease of @xmath12 with an increase in @xmath10 , and hence , in an appreciably large amount of evolution ( fig.[nonbgraphsa ] ) .",
    "a further consequence is that the ratio @xmath145 too is monotonic in @xmath10 ( fig.[nonbgraphsb ] ) .",
    "the slope though decreases with @xmath10 , leading to a flat behavior for moderately large @xmath10 values .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that , apart from @xmath0 being approximately linear in @xmath10 @xmath112 too is approximately linear especially for large @xmath10 .",
    "while the steep slope for small @xmath10 might seem intriguing given the almost linear behavior of both @xmath0 and @xmath12 in fig.[nonbgraphsa ] , it should be noted that @xmath0 is very small for such @xmath10 and consequently any departure from linearity would be magnified in the ratio . that the slopes at small @xmath10 values grow with @xmath138 is understandable too , as for larger @xmath138",
    ", the trilinear term contributions to @xmath112 assume greater significance .",
    "the abrupt ending of the curves , especially for larger @xmath138 values might seem curious .",
    "however , note that @xmath109 is appreciably larger in nugm:24 than in msugra ( see sec.[analysissubsec1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to a rapid suppression of @xmath146 , the mass of the lighter stau .",
    "while the latter also sees an enhancement on account of the @xmath36 gaugino mass being significantly larger in nugm:24 in comparison that within msugra for an identical value of @xmath10 , this effect is sub - dominant .",
    "consequently , for such parameter values , the lighter stau would have a mass smaller than the lightest of the neutralinos thereby becoming the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "since this is phenomenologically unacceptable , such regions of the parameter space have to be discarded .",
    "note though that the extent of the allowed parameter range in the @xmath10@xmath138 plane does depend on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "fig.[nonbgraphsc ] displays @xmath145 for different values of @xmath138 as @xmath11 is varied .",
    "as discussed before , @xmath0 increases with increase of @xmath11 and diminishes with increasing @xmath16 . for most of the region ( except when @xmath11 is large and @xmath16 quite small )",
    "the ratio can be large and negative because of a large degree of evolution of @xmath0 in nugm:24 . for larger",
    "@xmath138 , @xmath0 itself is much smaller .",
    "hence a large evolution results into a large negative @xmath12 . on the other hand , a larger value for @xmath11 pushes @xmath0 higher and @xmath12 would then be dragged down to a value near zero . additionally , we like to clarify that the larger @xmath16 curves really end near 2 tev or so in fig.[nonbgraphsc ] because of the rewsb requirement .",
    "this is unlike the smaller @xmath16 contours that span the entire @xmath11 range displayed .    as for the dependence on @xmath1 ( see fig.[nonbgraphsd ] ) , the relationship is once again linear , as predicted by eq.[eqnbzvsb0 ] , for either of the two models under discussion .      having analyzed the simple case of @xmath147 , we may now consider the effect of phases . to start with , we continue to maintain @xmath148 , but now consider @xmath149 , or , in other words , a maximal phase in the trilinear coupling .",
    "this choice maximizes the edm values@xcite . to study the generic features and compare with the results of sec.[resultssubsec1 ] , we first choose a relatively small value of @xmath41 ( @xmath150  gev ) .",
    "thus , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) would not be very different from the analysis of sec.[resultssubsec1 ] because of the absence of any phase in the gaugino parts of eqns.([eqnbrge ] & [ eqnatrge ] ) and the smallness of @xmath41 . with this choice of inputs ,",
    "the only contributions to @xmath153 or @xmath154 arise from @xmath155 themselves , and hence there is no occasion for cancellations / enhancements unlike in the case for the real parts .",
    "in addition , the effect of @xmath20 on @xmath42 would be limited even for maximal @xmath20 unless @xmath41 is quite large .",
    "this is reflected by figs.[compbgraph ] , wherein we display the variation of both @xmath37 and @xmath42 with @xmath10 for either model .",
    "the results are seen to be consistent with the no - phase cases of fig.[sugbgraphsa ] and fig.[nonbgraphsa ] .",
    "we now invoke a non - zero @xmath21 and analyze the resulting evolution of the same from the electroweak scale to the gut - scale . in figs.[phaseall ] , we display this for both msugra and nugm:24 , and in each case for two values of @xmath138 , namely 3 and 10 .",
    "again , for illustrative purposes , we choose , for the other relevant parameters , @xmath156  gev , @xmath157  gev and @xmath158  gev with @xmath121 .",
    "although the constraints from the edm measurements restrict @xmath34 to very small values ( @xmath159 ) , we display the functional dependence for a wider range of @xmath21 .",
    "the apparent discontinuities for the nugm:24 curves are not physical and have only been occasioned by the choice for the domain of @xmath31 , namely @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "clearly , the amount of phase evolution in nugm:24 is seen to be higher than that in msugra .",
    "having established that the degree of fine tuning could , in principle , be smaller in the nugm:24 case , we now perform a scan of the parameter space for both msugra and nugm:24 so as to quantify the extent of this reduction . in each case",
    ", we consider two different values of @xmath138 ( @xmath161 ) while maintaining @xmath162 so as to maximize the edm values .",
    "allowing @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath41 to vary up to 1 tev ( with the lower end set in accordance with the current limits on super - particle masses ) , we show , in figs.[phigraphall ] , the scatter plots in the @xmath32@xmath10 plane . it is interesting to note that , for low to moderate values of @xmath16 , the measure @xmath32 rarely becomes negative in the msugra case , whereas in the non - universal scenario it is more evenly distributed .    while @xmath163 does tend to concentrate around zero ( fig.[phigraphc ] ) , note that , for small @xmath138 , the nugm:24 case does have a significantly dense distribution up to @xmath164 and values as large as @xmath165 are also obtained , albeit with a reduced frequency . in contrast , the msugra case barely registers a presence even for @xmath166 ( fig.[phigrapha ] ) .",
    "thus , in going from msugra to nugm:24 , the fine - tuning can be reduced by a factor as large as @xmath167 . for the @xmath168 case",
    "though , the improvement is much more moderate . as fig.[phigraphb ] shows , the msugra scatter reaches up to @xmath169 , whereas the non - universal scenario admits @xmath170 ( fig.[phigraphd ] ) , or , in other words , a reduction of the maximal fine tuning by a factor of @xmath171 .",
    "more important , though , is that the density of points at higher @xmath32 is much larger in the nugm:24 case than for msugra . in other words , it is far more likely to have a less fine - tuned point in the parameter space for nugm:24 .",
    "concentrating on nugm:24 , we present , in fig.[slopecontours ] , contour plots for @xmath32 in the @xmath172 plane for two different values of @xmath138 .",
    "note that the limits on @xmath11 and @xmath10 are @xmath173 tev , higher than what was chosen for fig.[phigraphall ] .",
    "once again , @xmath41 is fixed at @xmath174 with @xmath121 .",
    "a comparison of the two plots clearly reinforces our earlier result that the fine - tuning is less severe for low @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 leading to a particular @xmath32 are highly correlated .",
    "note that both signs for @xmath32 are possible .",
    "the region where @xmath32 changes sign is associated with a parameter point where @xmath31 is @xmath175 . to summarize , the results displayed in fig.[phigraphall ] and fig.[slopecontours ] show that it is indeed possible to obtain a surprisingly large amount of reduction of phase sensitivity even for relatively small sparticle masses .",
    "we now explore , in detail , the range of @xmath16 that is associated with very low level of phase sensitivity or , in other words , a very large @xmath163 .",
    "as has been argued earlier , @xmath37 itself strongly depends on @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , @xmath112 , and thereby @xmath12 too , has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath16 .",
    "thus it is understandable that a very large @xmath163 would indeed prominently highlight such a dependence . rather than attempting a full , but very computing - intensive ,",
    "scan over the entire parameter space , we choose to restrict ourselves to the subset of the parameter space that would naturally produce very large values for @xmath163 , namely the region with small @xmath42 and small @xmath41 .",
    "hence we adopt a framework with given values for @xmath42 instead of @xmath16 .",
    "the requirement of rewsb determines @xmath138 once @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 are fixed .",
    "note however , that the point @xmath176 would imply the absence of any susy cp phase _",
    "at all scales_. thus , it is not surprising to obtain very large values of @xmath163 in this scenario .",
    "however , in this part of our work the focus is simply to study , the effect of @xmath16 on @xmath32 in detail , more importantly for large @xmath163 values . to quantify our study of this issue ,",
    "we choose small representative values viz . @xmath177 and @xmath178 , along with @xmath121 so as to maximize the edm contributions as before . in figs.[slopesmallb0 ] , we present various scatter plots for @xmath32 as @xmath11 and @xmath10 are varied over a wide range ( 0 to 2 tev ) .",
    "note that the results of this analysis have a significant dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath41 to @xmath179 gev may reduce @xmath32 by a factor of 10 to 20 . as fig.[sugslopesmallb0 ] shows , within msugra , @xmath163 could be as large as @xmath179 while most of the points lie between @xmath137 to @xmath180 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in nugm:24 ( fig.[nonslopesmallb0 ] ) where @xmath163 may go up to @xmath181 while typically ranging between @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "thus , nugm:24 is much better able to accommodate low phase - sensitivity solutions than do the universal gaugino mass scenarios .",
    "it is curious to note that , unlike what fig.[phigraphall ] suggested , @xmath32 could assume negative values within msugra ( see fig.[sugslopesmallb0 ] ) .",
    "this prompts us present a scatter plot of @xmath32 against the derived quantity @xmath138 . as fig.[sugtanslopesmallb0 ] shows , msugra admits negative @xmath32 only for large @xmath138 .",
    "in fact , even for the positive branch , large values of @xmath163 are typically concentrated in the large @xmath16 ( 20 to 45 ) region .",
    "in contrast , for nugm:24 , @xmath32 assumes larger values typically for low @xmath16 values ( 2 to 5 ) .",
    "it should be remembered in this context that , within nugm:24 , the large @xmath138 domain is significantly restricted from considerations of the lsp ( see sec.[resultssubsec1 ] ) . that the favored range for @xmath16 is different in the two scenarios is attributable to the interplay between the cancellations / enhancements in the rge evolution of @xmath0 on the one hand and the requirement of rewsb on the other .    finally , we comment on the case of @xmath184 .",
    "it turns out that for this branch of @xmath19 and @xmath121 , one has @xmath185 for almost all the parameter space of nugm:24 . as a result",
    "one finds no advantage toward reducing the phase sensitivity .",
    "as is well known , the experimental upper bounds on the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the electron impose strong constraints on any source of @xmath186 violation in supersymmetric models , in particular on the weak scale phase parameters .",
    "for example , in the minimal supergravity model , @xmath21 , the phase of the bilinear higgs coupling parameter is constrained to be typically smaller than @xmath187 , with only some very limited regions ( such as the focus point scenario ) in the parameter space admitting slightly larger ( @xmath116 ) values .",
    "this , however , implies a severe fine - tuning condition for @xmath31 , the value of the same phase parameter at the unification scale . in turn ,",
    "@xmath20 , the phase of the trilinear coupling parameter is also severely fine - tuned .",
    "this has been a longstanding problem with msugra - like scenarios .    to quantify this problem",
    ", we define a _ phase naturalness _",
    "measure @xmath32 as the ratio of the spread of the phase @xmath31 at the unification scale that is consonant with the spread @xmath21 allowed , at the electroweak scale , by the electric dipole moment constraints a larger @xmath32 would imply a lower degree of phase sensitivity .",
    "one finds that , unless @xmath16 is very large , @xmath32 may be approximated to @xmath188 for much of the parameter space .    in this analysis",
    ", we have demonstrated that models admitting a large rg evolution of the bilinear higgs coupling could be interesting in the context of a reduction in the fine - tuning of phases . in particular , we choose a supergravity - inspired scenario wherein non - universal gaugino masses arise from a gauge kinetic energy function @xmath43 transforming as a particular non - singlet representation of @xmath60 ( nugm:24 of table  [ tabrelativeweights ] ) . as in the msugra ( singlet @xmath40 )",
    "case , this representation , considered in isolation , introduces no additional phase for the gaugino masses .    studying the nature of the evolution of @xmath0 to understand the correspondence with phase - sensitivity",
    ", we identify the large cancellations in the rge for @xmath0 as being primarily responsible for the high degree of fine - tuning within msugra . in the nugm:24 ,",
    "on the other hand , the said cancellations are replaced by enhancements ( on account of the reversal in the sign of the gaugino mass terms ) and this translates into a reduction of the above - mentioned fine - tuning .",
    "in fact , @xmath32 can be significantly increased in nugm:24 ( by a factor of 10 to 20 ) with respect to comparable msugra type of models .",
    "the said improvement is typically more pronounced for small @xmath16 values .",
    "a particularly interesting result is the identification of extended regions in the nugm:24 parameter space which admit a low degree of phase - sensitivity even for relatively small super - particle masses .",
    "this feature is absent in msugra as well as in most other models with high scale inputs for susy breaking .",
    "we further explored the dependence of our results , on @xmath16 , by specifically concentrating on the parameter space corresponding to very large @xmath32 ( or very small phase sensitivity ) so as to compare the two models .",
    "naturally , this occurs close to vanishing @xmath1 and @xmath12 values .",
    "we adopt a scheme where @xmath12 itself is given as an input parameter instead of @xmath16 , given the more direct relationship of @xmath12 with @xmath32 .",
    "our analysis shows that , even here , the values of @xmath32 in nugm:24 are typically larger by a factor of 10 to 20 in comparison to those in msugra . and",
    "whereas msugra generically requires large @xmath16 ( 20 to 40 ) for @xmath163 to be large , the nugm:24 scenario prefers a smaller @xmath16 ( 2 to 5 ) instead .    finally ,",
    "while our analysis has focussed on @xmath60 as the gut gauge group , similar considerations hold for @xmath189 as well .",
    "a suitable non - singlet representation resulting in a similar gaugino - mass pattern as in nugm:24 would also produce such a reduction of phase sensitivity .",

    "<S> the phases in a generic low - energy supersymmetric model are severely constrained by the experimental upper bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron and the neutron . </S>",
    "<S> coupled with the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , this results in a large degree of fine tuning of the phase parameters at the unification scale . in supergravity type models , this corresponds to very highly tuned values for the phases of the bilinear higgs coupling parameter @xmath0 and the universal trilinear coupling @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a cancellation / enhancement mechanism associated with the renormalization group evolution of @xmath0 , which , in turn , reduces such fine - tuning quite appreciably without taking recourse to very large masses for the supersymmetric partners . </S>",
