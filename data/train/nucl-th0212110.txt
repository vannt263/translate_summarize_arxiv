    "the @xmath1-isobar degrees of freedom play a crucial role in the description of numerous processes in nuclear and hadron physics .",
    "in such a description the @xmath1-isobar is either generated in the process itself or can be considered as `` preexisting '' in the wave function of the initial system . in any case",
    "we need to understand the dynamics for the @xmath1-isobar in a nuclear system , which in turn requires the construction of an adequate model for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the long - range part of the @xmath0 interaction is governed by the @xmath4-exchange , but its intermediate- and short - range parts are poorly known up to date , and thus it is an important topic for further studies . on the other hand , at low energies the @xmath1-isobar due to its rather high mass",
    "should be taken in the far off - shell region , and thus , the short - range part of the @xmath0 interaction will be essential for the understanding of many low- and intermediate - energy processes .    unfortunately , even for the @xmath2 system which has been studied in much more details than the @xmath0 system the short - range part of the interaction is known rather poorly . in the current @xmath2 models the short - range part of the interaction (",
    "e.g. the high - momentum behaviour of vertex form factors in the meson - exchange models ) is only fitted to the experimental @xmath2 phase shifts . because such a fit would be hardly possible for the @xmath0 system",
    ", one should resort to a consistent microscopic treatment of the short - range interaction within a realistic model with a common set of parameters for the @xmath2 and @xmath0 systems . in our opinion any consistent microscopic treatment of short - range @xmath2 and @xmath0 interactions should include both quark and meson degrees of freedom .",
    "the quark approach to the short - range @xmath2 interaction has a more than two - decade history during which many methods have been developed , e.g. the adiabatic  @xcite and resonating group methods ( rgm )  @xcite , quark compound bag ( qcb ) model  @xcite , hybrid models  @xcite , etc .",
    "these models are in agreement with the @xmath2 data at intermediate energies , but all of them treat the inner @xmath2-system on a rather phenomenological level .",
    "important meson field degrees of freedom remain absent .    in the recently proposed moscow - tbingen dressed - bag model  @xcite",
    "we start from the quark - configuration analysis of the rgm wave function including the configuration mixing at short range  @xcite and take into consideration the proper meson cloud including 2@xmath4 and @xmath5 contributions of the bag - like six - quark component in the overlap region around 0.6  fm .",
    "contrary to other models which exploit the meson cloud coupled to the quark core of the nucleon ( e.g. the cloudy bag model  @xcite ) we have formulated our approach to the six - quark intermediate states using the fock - column representation for the vectors of state and we have proposed a new mechanism for the dressing of the six - quark bag with the @xmath5-meson field . with three phenomenological parameters in each partial wave",
    "@xmath6 the model describes the @xmath2 scattering data for @xmath7 up to 1  gev with high precision including the tensor mixing and all the properties of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the model describes the short - range @xmath0 interaction as well . in both channels , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the short - range interaction is determined by the same constraint originating from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "another key problem in this field is the possibility of tests of this part of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "if one samples the @xmath0 wave function by quasielastic @xmath8 knock - out of the @xmath1-isobar ( or of the nucleon ) from the deuteron , it would be rather a study of a `` preexisting '' @xmath0 component .",
    "another method consists in the @xmath1-isobar excitation by real photons and in a study of the off - shell @xmath0 rescattering amplitude in the final state ( diagram in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) ) .",
    "we have selected the pion photoproduction reactions @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the @xmath1-resonance region in a kinematic setting which maximises the pion kinetic energy . the corresponding forward - angle photoproduction cross sections are sensitive to the short - range part of the @xmath0 interaction . to prove this statement we evaluate the contribution of the short - range @xmath0 final - state interaction ( fsi ) to the pion photoproduction cross section starting from the constituent quark model ( cqm ) for baryons and from the dressed - bag model  @xcite for @xmath2 and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the cqm describes with reasonable accuracy all the electro - magnetic and strong production processes at least for the free nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the results for free nucleons can readily be generalized for any baryon and for the six - quark component of any nucleon - baryon system .",
    "here we consider @xmath4 photoproduction in the @xmath1-resonance region , but such a consideration could be easily extended to @xmath11 photoproduction in the @xmath12-resonance region , or to other similar cases . even though the cqm approach is limited in use by a non - relativistic harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . )",
    "basis and a naive @xmath13 model of meson production , there is the advantage , that it allows us to embody all the relevant baryon resonances in the reaction mechanism with predictable amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding experimental data can be directly related to the internal structure of these resonances .    up to now",
    "the role of the @xmath0 final state interaction ( fsi ) in the pion photoproduction off nuclei has been poorly investigated .",
    "we recall that the @xmath1-resonance region at @xmath14250 - 350  mev is most convenient for such a study since the influence of other resonances , e.g. @xmath15(1440 ) or @xmath12(1535 ) , is negligible in this region , and thus the main mechanism of photoproduction is a quasifree process with a virtual @xmath1-isobar excitation .",
    "it is well known that the contribution of this mechanism to the @xmath3 production off the deuteron overestimates the forward - angle cross section  @xcite by a factor of 1.5 to 2 and that the fsi should play a decisive role in this region  @xcite .",
    "recent evaluations  @xcite have shown that taking into account the @xmath16 fsi can bring theoretical predictions into better agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "it is quite plausible that the @xmath0 fsi plays also a certain role in the @xmath3 photoproduction along with the @xmath2 fsi  @xcite , and if so , there will be a possibility to study the @xmath0 interaction in the photoproduction processes on nuclei .",
    "the contribution of the direct @xmath0 interaction to pion production depends essentially on the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath0 amplitude because of the integration over the inner momenta in the loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) .",
    "earlier attempts to take the direct @xmath0 interaction into account in terms of an @xmath17-channel resonance pole mechanism  @xcite did not bring a detectable improvement in the description of the data . on the other hand",
    "there is a successful coupled - channel ( @xmath18 ) approach to pion production in nn collisions  @xcite , and for the full study of the fsi problem it would be desirable to include a couple - channel description of both @xmath2 and @xmath0 final states .",
    "then the long - distance @xmath0 correlations would be fully taken into consideration .    in a more simple approach . which is used here",
    ", the final - state @xmath2 interaction includes diagrams with @xmath0 intermediate states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) by the diagrammatic representation of this interaction .",
    "the virtual @xmath0 channel is partially taken into account in the @xmath2 fsi . simplifying the problem in such a manner , we imply further that the diagram in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) is related only to the `` direct '' short - range @xmath0 interaction .    by the following prescriptions of the dressed - bag model",
    "we evaluate here the contribution of this `` direct '' short - range @xmath0 fsi to the differential cross section and show that this contribution is not small and can not be neglected .",
    "as a first step of the study , it is demonstrated by comparison of the results of two simplified models for pion photoproduction off the deuteron : ( i ) the quasifree mechanism , ( ii ) the quasifree mechanism modified by the @xmath0 fsi born term .",

    "<S> the impact of the short - range @xmath0 interaction on the pion photoproduction processes off the deuteron in the @xmath1-resonance region is studied in the framework of recently proposed dressed - bag model . </S>",
    "<S> a common dressing procedure for bare three- and six - quark states is used to describe both the pion decay widths of baryon resonances and the effective @xmath2 ( or @xmath0 ) interaction at short ranges related to the inner dressed - bag states . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the effect of short - range @xmath0 interaction for the forward - angle @xmath3 photoproduction off the deuteron can not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the prospects for further development of the model to describe the short - range @xmath2 ( or @xmath0 ) correlations in the lightest nuclei are discussed . </S>"
