    "matrix models provide an arena in which the notion of integrability is realized as noncritical string theory . at the same time",

    "computation of macroscopic loop amplitudes@xcite @xcite demonstrates this fact most explicitly : the boundary condition which is hard to solve in the continuum framework @xcite turns out to be related to the most natural quantity in matrix models .",
    "let us begin with recalling this .",
    "a crude correspondence of matrix models with path integrals of noncritical strings tells us that the connected part of the correlator given by averaging over matrix integrals of the product of singlet correlators < < tr ^q_1 tr ^q_2 tr ^q_n > > _ n , conn is an n - punctured surface swept by a noncritical string . to turn these punctures into holes of a macroscpic size ,",

    "@xmath16 is the renormalized string coupling and @xmath17 is an auxiliary parameter which plays the role of a cutoff .",
    "an equivalent and more efficient procedure is to consider the correlator consisting of the product of @xmath0-resolvents @xmath18 , to pick its most singular piece and finally to carry out the inverse laplace transforms over @xmath19 s .",
    "this in turn means [ eq : procedure ] a_n ( _ 1 , _ 2 , _",
    "n ) = ( _ j=1^n l_j^-1 ) _ a0 _",
    "n < < _ i=1^n tr > > _ n , conn . here , @xmath20 denotes the inverse laplace transform with respect to @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes the critical value of @xmath19 . in this paper",
    ", we will carry out this procedure in depth at the @xmath24 critical point realized by the symmetric potential of the two - matrix model . here",
    "@xmath25 .    in the next section ,",
    "we evaluate the connected part of the correlator consisting of the product of @xmath0-resolvents for large @xmath26 just mentioned above and derive a general formula for this object in the continuum planar limit .",

    "our formula contains a term distinguishable from others , namely the one which is expressible as the total @xmath27 derivatives . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes the renormalized cosmological constant .",
    "this structure is familiar from the case of pure two - dimensional gravity .",
    "this term is , however , found to be supplemented , for @xmath28 , by an increasing number of other terms with @xmath0 .",
    "this latter structure testifies to the existence of interactions which can not be captured by the naive notion of operator product expansion for microscopic loop operators : the macroscopic loop operator will be expanded by these .",
    "for that reason , these interactions may be referred to as contact interactions .    in section iii , we consider the @xmath27 @xmath29 term .",
    "we are successful in representing this terms as the summations over @xmath30 indices with its summand in a form of @xmath0 factorized products .",

    "we determine the complete form for this part of the amplitude in terms of the boundary lengths @xmath2 @xmath31 .",

    "although it is not unlikely that one can determine the full amplitude this way for arbitrary @xmath0 , the proof remains elusive . we will finish with a few remarks concerning with the properties of these residual interactions .    in appendix",
    "a , we derive a set of recursion relations which are used to evaluate the formula in section iii .",
    "these recursion relations relate the expression of the terms appearing in the @xmath0-resolvent to those in the @xmath7-resolvent .",
