    "nevertheless , the momentum is also known from the hamilton s equations ( [ 1b ] ) .",
    "hence , the oscillator problem is completely solved .",
    "the equation of motion of a quantum sho may simply be obtained by imposing @xmath9 and @xmath10 as noncommuting operators . to avoid confusion ,",

    "the solution of a quantum sho in heisenberg picture is the operator equivalent of the equation ( [ 1d ] ) .",
    "now for real physical problems , the anharmonicity and/or damping are to be incorporated in the model hamiltonian and hence in the equation of motion .",
    "however , the present letter takes care the anharmonicity only .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian of an anharmonic oscillator ( having unit mass and unit frequency ) of even order of anharmonicity is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an integer and @xmath0 is the anharmonic constant .",
    "depending upon the problem of physical interests , different type of anharmonic oscillators will appear .",
    "for @xmath15 the corresponding oscillator is called quartic anharmonic oscillator . similarly , @xmath16 and @xmath17 give rise to the sextic and octic anharmonic oscillators respectively .",
    "of course , the anharmonic constants @xmath0 are different for different type of anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the equation of motion corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ 1 g ] ) is @xmath18 where the equation ( [ 1b ] ) is used .",
    "the problem of classical and quantum anharmonic oscillators have already been studied by several authors . to begin with , we recall the problem of a classical quartic oscillator ( duffing oscillator ) .",
    "the equation ( [ 1h ] ) , for @xmath15 does not have exact solution .",
    "however , large number of approximate methods are available for the purpose of getting analytical solutions to the duffing oscillator problem .",
    "these include perturbation technique [ [ nayfeh ] ] , variation of parameters [ [ ross ] ] and taylor series approaches [ [ marganeau ] ] .",
    "the ordinary perturbation technique , a pedestrian approach , leads to the unwanted secular terms [ [ nayfeh ] ] .",
    "the removal of secular terms from the solution is a serious problem .",
    "there are some methods which are successfully used to summed up the secular terms for all orders .",
    "these include `` tucking in technique '' [ [ bellmann ] ] , multiscale perturbation theory and renormalization technique[[nayfeh ] ] .",
    "the search for the solutions of anharmonic oscillators enriched different brunches of physics and mathematics , for example , it is successfully used to enrich the subject of large order perturbation theory [ [ bender 1]-[lowdin ] ] , divergent expansion of quantum mechanics [ [ simon]-[graffi ] ] , laplace transformation representation of energy eigenvalues [ [ ivanov ] ] and computational physics [ [ weniger]-[fernandez ] ] .",

    "the energy eigenvalues are found to diverge for large anharmonic constant . in case of small @xmath0 ,",
    "however , the eigenvalues for different orders are summed up and the convergence of these sums are ensured by the borel summability [ [ graffi],[graffi 1 ] ] and/ or stieljet conditions [ [ loeffel ] ] .",
    "the c - number approach to the quantum oscillator problem is found very successful but the situation is different with the operator approach .",
    "actually , the noncommuting nature of the operators ( [ 1e ] ) pose a serious difficulty for the purpose of getting approximate solutions to the quantum anharmonic oscillator problems .",
    "only few methods are available to - date .",
    "aks [ [ aks0]]and aks and caharat [ [ aks ] ] first obtained an operator solution of a quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator by using the method of bogoliubov and krylov .",
    "but the recent interest in the problem started with the work of bender and bettencourt [ [ bender]-[cmb1 ] ] who obtained the solution of a quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator by using multiscale perturbation theory ( mspt ) .",
    "later on mandal[[mandal ] ] proposed a taylor series approach , egusquiza and basagoiti[[egusquiza ] ] developed renormalization technique , kahn and zarmi[[kahn ] ] used a near identity transform method to solve the quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator problem .",
    "the taylor series approach is found to be more successful compared to the other approaches for the purpose of getting second or higher order solution of a quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator [ [ anirban ] ] .",
    "in addition to the quartic oscillator , people have studied the higher anharmonic oscillators also [ [ weniger ] , [ laksman]-[dutt ] ] .",
    "these studies are made to obtain the eigenvalues as function of anharmonicity .",
    "more recently pathak [ [ pathak ] ] used a normal ordering technique to obtain a zeroth order multiscale perturbation theoretic solution of @xmath19 anharmonic oscillator and fernandez[[fernandez ] ] developed an eigen value approach to construct first order correction to the frequency operator for @xmath19 anharmonic oscillator .",
    "however , a first order solution of higher anharmonic oscillators in the realm of heisenberg approach are yet to come . keeping that in mind , the present letter will take care the analytical solutions of classical and quantum oscillators of sextic and octic anharmonicities .",
    "these oscillators have potential applications in the studies of nonlinear mechanics , molecular physics , quantum optics and in the field theory .",
    "this is the first time we give analytical solution of sextic and octic oscillators under the operator formalism .",
    "the solutions are used to obtain the frequency shifts of sextic and octic oscillators .",
    "the computed shifts are compared and found to have exact coincidence with the frequency shifts calculated by using a first order perturbation theory and frequency operators obtained by pathak [ [ pathak ] ] .",
    "for @xmath20 the hamiltonian ( [ 1 g ] ) and the equation of motion ( [ 1h ] ) correspond to the case of a sextic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "the solution for such an oscillator is obtained as the sum of different orders of anharmonicities .",
    "the corresponding solution is @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are zeroth and first order solutions respectively .",
    "the zeroth order solution ( [ 1d ] ) is simply obtained for @xmath24 in equation ( [ 1h ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the present section is to find the first order solution @xmath25 the lower case @xmath26 and @xmath27 are to be treated as time developments of position and momentum of the classical sextic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "the equivalent operator representations are to be made by using upper case letters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus the solution of the classical sextic anharmonic oscillator is given by the following taylor series @xmath30 here we assume that @xmath8 is sufficiently small and a series ( [ 3 ] ) expansion is possible .",
    "now we express higher order time derivatives of @xmath26 at @xmath31 as @xmath32 where , we have neglected @xmath33 and higher order terms .",
    "we substitute the relations ( [ 4 ] ) in equation ( [ 3 ] ) to collect the coefficients of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( without the constant multiplication factor @xmath0 ) .",
    "corresponding coefficients are @xmath36 where the coefficient of @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath38 . the contributions directly from taylor expansion are not taken into consideration .",
    "the @xmath39 term of @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 now we can write the @xmath39 term of the coefficient of @xmath42 in @xmath23 as @xmath43 where the factor @xmath44 comes from the taylor expansion part .",
    "the net coefficient of @xmath42 in @xmath23 is obtained as @xmath45 the parameter @xmath46 exhibits fifth and third harmonic generations along with the secular term proportional to @xmath47 the secular terms are responsible for the divergent nature of the solution .",
    "this is an uncomfortable situation and has to be taken care properly in order to get a well behaved solution for all orders .",
    "now , the remaining coefficients are obtained by using the same procedure as adopted for the evaluation of @xmath48 the corresponding coefficients are    @xmath49    hence , the first order solution is given by @xmath50 thus the total solution ( [ 2 ] ) is simply @xmath51    now to have a check of the solution ( [ 10 ] ) , we consider a special case @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence the total solution reduces to an extraordinarily simple form as @xmath54 it is clear that the presence of secular term proportional to @xmath55 makes the life difficult as @xmath8 grows .",
    "we confine ourselves in the weak coupling regime and we assume @xmath56 is a constant such that @xmath57 now , the equation ( [ 11 ] ) is rearranged as @xmath58+\\lambda a^{5}(-\\frac{1}{24}cost+\\frac{5}{128}cos3t+\\frac{1}{384}cos5t)\\ ] ] where the equation ( [ 13a ] ) is used .",
    "thus the secular term present in the first order solution ( [ 11 ] ) is summed up for all orders and the frequency shift of the oscillator is obtained .",
    "the corresponding frequency shift of the sextic anharmonic oscillator is @xmath59 .",
    "the shifted frequency of the oscillator is also viewed as the renormalization of frequency by the anharmonic interaction .",
    "interestingly , the frequency shift obtained in the solution ( [ 12 ] ) exactly coincides with that obtained by dutt and lakshmanan [ [ dutt ] ] . now to have an idea of how good the solutions ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] )",
    "are we compare them with the exact numerical solution obtained by mathematica ( figure 1 ) . from figure 1",
    ", we observe that the first order frequency renormalized solution ( [ 12 ] ) coincides exactly with the exact numerical solution obtained by using mathematica ( for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , the solution ( [ 11 ] ) diverges with the increase of time ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the divergent nature of the solution manifests the presence of secular term .",
    "figure1    now we replace @xmath26 and @xmath27 with the noncommuting operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to generalize the classical solution ( [ 2 ] ) into a quantum solution of the anharmonic oscillator by the imposition of commutation relation ( [ 1e ] ) .",
